<p class="fst">A year of peace has clearly revealed the changed relationship of forces between 
  the great powers on a world scale. British imperialism is now definitely reduced 
  to a subordinate position between the two giants, American imperialism and the 
  Soviet Union. While attempting to maintain an independent position in relation 
  to the USA, Britain has entered upon the epoch of definitive decline. She no 
  longer even aspires to a position of world domination and unchallenged superiority 
  possessed by her in the nineteenth century. Desperately, Britain attempts to 
  maintain the Empire, and at least a secondary status in the world. But she is 
  compelled to play a vassal role to American imperialism.</p>


<p>American imperialism now has unchallenged domination of the seas. As a result, 
  she holds the lifelines of Britain - the channels of sea trade - at her mercy. 
  In Eastern Asia, China tends to come under the sway of America, with Britain 
  crowded out. An independent or pseudo-independent Egypt and India will tend 
  also to gravitate towards the almighty dollar. Britain's dominions come more 
  and more within the American orbit. On her own, Britain cannot hope to match 
  her puny forces against the industrial and military might of the USA.</p>


<p>Britain emerged 'victorious' from the first world war. She strengthened temporarily 
  her position on the continent of Europe, Increased her control of the gateways 
  to her Empire through the Middle East and expanded the territory controlled 
  by her central government and armed forces by' one million square miles. Despite 
  this, the first world war marked the decline of Britain in relation to American 
  imperialism.</p>


<p>The result of the second world war was a veritable disaster for the British 
  imperialists. In Europe, having defeated the Frankenstein which they helped 
  to create in the shape of nazi imperialism, the British capitalists are faced 
  with an even greater menace in the domination of half of Europe by the Soviet 
  Union. The immediate cause of Britain's declaration of war on Germany was to 
  prevent the domination of the Balkans and Eastern Europe - which could only 
  be a stepping stone to the Empire. Now, not only in this region, but in the 
  Middle East and Asia, Britain is faced with a refurbished version of her nineteenth 
  century nightmare - a Balkans dominated by Russia with control of the Middle 
  East and India at her mercy. She is today faced with a power not only stronger 
  than Czarism, but a greater threat than either the Kaiser's Germany or Hitler's 
  Third Reich. A power which, because of its revolutionary traditions and an economy 
  based on state ownership of the means of production, has a social appeal to 
  the Asiatic peoples oppressed by British imperialism.</p>


<p>Britain is compelled for this reason alone to try and arrive at a compromise 
  with sections of the colonial bourgeoisie. That is the significance of the treaties 
  Britain is attempting to negotiate in Egypt and in India. She is faced, however, 
  with a development of national consciousness and a ferment on the part of the 
  masses far greater and more profound in its implications than after the first 
  world war. This is the principal reason why she must make concessions to the 
  colonies.</p>


<p>In addition, the masses of Britain have lost all zest for the glories of the 
  Empire and could not be relied on to put down, by force of arms, a long and 
  protracted struggle against the uprisings of the colonial peoples as soldiers 
  and occupation forces.</p>


<p>Another factor is the pressure of American imperialism which seeks to break 
  the bonds of Empire in order to gain a freer channel of trade and to make Britain 
  absolutely dependent upon her. Britain's economy is not strong enough to maintain 
  her hold on the Empire by the old methods of economic control, nor has she the 
  military force to guarantee and maintain her old colonial military oppression. 
  Thus, while preserving the formal framework of the Empire, in reality the liquidation 
  of the Empire is taking place.</p>


<p>The tame acceptance by the Tories of the policy of the Labour government is 
  dictated by their recognition of the real changes in world relations. Thus, 
  by concessions, the bourgeoisie hope to disguise the process of the disintegration 
  of the Empire and by some miracle, to delay it. The sun is setting on the British 
  Empire. It can look forward only to further disturbances and decline. In so 
  far as it continues to exist, it will do so largely by the gracious consent 
  of Wall Street.</p>


<h4>Long Term Economic Perspective</h4>

<p>The economic basis of this process was long ago analysed and foreseen by Marxism. 
  Britain's accession of wealth and power and her domination of half the world 
  was gained at a period of the rise of capitalism and at a time when there were 
  no other challengers in the race for world supremacy. Her advantages, as Trotsky 
  has shown in his book <em>Where is Britain Going?, </em>have become her disadvantages. 
  Her technique fell behind that of Germany and the United States. Because of 
  their incapacity to compete, the British capitalist class - above all the monopolists 
  - deliberately sabotaged the development of technique hoping to entrench themselves, 
  like the empire of France, on their huge resources and their own backwardness. 
  Basing themselves on a semi closed-in system of the sterling bloc, with assured 
  markets, British capitalism had no incentive to begin large scale rationalisation 
  of industry, which could only lead to increased production, without the possibility 
  of finding increased markets.</p>


<p>This privileged position has been lost forever by the war. The vampire economy 
  of Britain which, through her investments abroad, extracted tribute from her 
  empire and semi-colonies and spheres of influence, has been undermined through 
  the loss of foreign investments through the war. The unfavourable balance of 
  trade, which was formerly a weapon in the hands of British imperialism, now 
  becomes a dreaded threat to the standard of living of the masses and the very 
  existence of British capitalism. What was the greatest stability in the system 
  has now become the source of the greatest instability. Britain is more than 
  ever dependent on the markets of the world, with the result that her economy 
  will be even more affected by economic slumps than in the past. Britain is compelled 
  to launch the struggle for markets with a greater ferocity and intensity than 
  German imperialism launched the struggle for exports under the nazis. The character 
  of British world trade has changed. Her privileged economic position which cushioned 
  the full impact of world slump, as in the crisis of 1931, now changes into its 
  opposite. The export of coal, which was her staple export, has dropped to almost 
  nothing. The weakness of her economy is expressed in the fact that today she 
  has not sufficient coal for her own needs. Meanwhile, because of the industrialisation 
  of formerly backward areas of the world - above all of the Dominions and the 
  Empire - Britain is no longer exporting the same type of goods. There has been 
  a transformation of Britain's exports, which in turn has resulted in a change 
  in the industrial structure of the country. In the long run this makes Britain 
  more vulnerable than ever in the fluctuations of the world market.</p>


<p>Exposed to the vagaries of the world market, no longer able to protect herself 
  on the basis of a closed-in Empire from competition, above all from America, 
  Britain is compelled to abandon the policy of maintaining antiquated equipment 
  in order to ensure profits, and to modernise her equipment to enter into competition 
  against American production.</p>


<p>However, all these measures of British capitalism will be in vain. It is too 
  late to catch up with the colossus across the Atlantic. Senile British capitalism 
  cannot rejuvenate itself and capture new positions in a world market - which 
  is shrinking in relation to world productivity. The long-term outlook for British 
  imperialism is one of certain catastrophe.</p>


<h4>Short-term Economic Perspective</h4>

<p>This long-term perspective of British imperialism is indisputable and has been 
  long foreseen. However, a mistake in conjuncture which was made was the telescoping 
  of the inevitable long-term crisis with the immediate perspective for Britain.</p>


<p>We anticipated that British imperialism would be faced with a crisis as soon 
  as the war was ended. However, the concatenation of circumstances has served 
  to screen the disastrous results of the war for Britain. The huge markets created 
  bv the destruction of the war can be utilised because of the temporary quiescence 
  of the proletariat. What was an unfavourable relationship of forces has been 
  turned into a temporarily favourable one. Germany has, for the time being, collapsed 
  as a competitor; America has been faced with a series of unprecedented strike 
  struggles in basic industry; Europe and the world needs tremendous quantities 
  of capital goods, above all machinery.</p>


<p>At home, six years of war have created a huge market for consumer goods. The 
  desperation of British imperialism compels the introduction of new capital equipment 
  into the coal mines and steel industry. Rationalisation and streamlining of 
  cotton and other industries are being pressed as a measure of survival. The 
  housing shortage and the destruction in the blitz created a boom in the building 
  industry. The fusion of finance capital and the state inevitably results in 
  increasing measures of regulation and of 'planning'. The tendency towards state 
  capitalism and state control is shown by the projected nationalisation of the 
  mines, steel, transport and fuel, and by the blocking of export of capital and 
  partial control of investment. These measures will undoubtedly temporarily aid 
  the economy as a whole in the economic upswing. The lavish subsidies of the 
  state, directly and indirectly, rebates of excess profits tax, subsidies to 
  the cotton barons, subsidies to the food and chemical trusts, etc, help to prop 
  up the structure. All these burdens, of course, are basically at the expense 
  of the British inasses.</p>


<p>In addition US imperialism, anxious to use Britain as a future base against 
  the USSR, has granted a huge loan. This will tide Britain over the next few 
  years. Even without it, her export-import position has improved with amazing 
  rapidity. The export rate now exceeds pre-war levels and is reaching record 
  figures. The loan, however, will be swallowed up by the needs of capitalist 
  economy. Despite the increase in exports, it is impossible to bridge the unfavourable 
  balance of trade.</p>


<p>All these factors, however, lead to the situation where British capitalism 
  temporarily attains a relative stability, only later, we repeat, to be faced 
  with a catastrophe greater than she has ever experienced in the whole of her 
  history.</p>


<p>The inevitable crisis, however, will not be immediate. It will be delayed for 
  a time. The orientation and strategy of the Revolutionary Communist Party is 
  firmly based on the long-term perspective of crisis and decline; but its eyes 
  are also wide open to the immediate conjunctural upswing and its meaning. <em>For 
  it is on the basis of the economic upswing and the political and industrial 
  moods it will engender, that the immediate evolution of the proletariat will 
  depend. </em>Before a new radicalisation takes place which will lift the workers 
  onto new and higher levels of struggle, deep economic and political transformations 
  will come into being. The growth and building of the revolutionary party, the 
  strengthening of its ties with the advanced sections of the working class, will 
  depend to a considerable extent on a correct prognosis of this period.</p>


<h4>Politics of the Capitalist Class</h4>

<p>The perplexity of the capitalist class and lack of confidence in the future, 
  was reflected in their policy during the war and during the general election. 
  While <em>The Times</em>, organ of the basic section of the British bourgeoisie, 
  regarded the election with an air of impartiality, the Tory Party tried desperately 
  to make use of the Churchill mascot and to frighten the petit bourgeoisie with 
  the spectre of a Gestapo-like dictatorship under the Labour Party. But the change 
  in the psychology of the workers was too deep-seated for the success of such 
  tricks.</p>


<p>However, the result of the election indicates that capitalism still has many 
  heavy reserves in the backward sections of the population, who still live in 
  the past. The Tories and Liberals together received a vote equal to that of 
  the combined working-class parties. It was the peculiar electoral system of 
  Britain which gave the tremendous majority at the polls to the Labour Party. 
  Nevertheless, 12 million votes for the Labour Party is a sign of the tremendous 
  radicalisation that has taken place.</p>


<p>The Tories are seeking to gain agreement for the defeat of the Labour government. 
  But such an agreement and such a defeat is not a perspective which is likely 
  to mature without a crisis. At present, the ruling class, through the Tory Party, 
  prepares to bide its time and, while utilising every opportunity to discredit 
  the Labour leaders, it relies upon them to carry on the burdens of imperialism. 
  Both at home and abroad, in the present relationship of forces, it is more suitable 
  to have Labour leaders do the dirty work of capitalism. At this stage they have 
  no intention of disturbing the present relationship of forces and thereby rousing 
  the anger of the masses, who tolerate the present standards under a Labour government, 
  but would not accept these under the Tories.</p>


<p>At this stage the bourgeoisie has no need for the fascist bands, even as an 
  auxiliary weapon to discipline the proletariat. Nor, it must be added, could 
  they immediately succeed in forming such bands. But moods within the Tory reformers 
  and the right wing of the Tory Party indicate the possibilities, at a later 
  stage, of a swing towards the formation of royalist-dictatorial or fascist movements.</p>


<p>The Liberal section of the capitalist class tends, at this stage, to lean towards 
  the Labour government and to support the reforms or semi-reforms which it is 
  introducing. But the Liberals, already a dwindling and vanishing force, have 
  only a perspective of further decline.</p>


<p>Of course, in the event of a serious crisis, all the forces of the bourgeoisie 
  will gather together, with a big section of the Labour MPs - a majority of whom 
  are petit bourgeois, even bourgeois in origins and outlook - to try and refurbish 
  a new version of the National government.</p>


<p>However, such a development is not an immediate perspective. The Labour government 
  of 1929-31 was a government of crisis right from the start, having come to power 
  at a time of the world slump. On this basis the bourgeoisie was enabled to manipulate 
  the situation, because of the incapacity of the Labour government to cope with 
  the crisis, to precipitate its downfall and prepare the victory of the National 
  government in the panic election of 1931.</p>


<p>The economic situation today is entirely different to that of 1929-31. The 
  bourgeoisie does not wish to disturb the present relationship of class forces, 
  and by rousing the proletariat to action, precipitate an anti-capitalist movement 
  among the masses which would have serious consequences for the economy.</p>


<p>The bourgeoisie is waiting for the slump, when they will use the crisis against 
  the Labour Party and the working class. However, they dread the possibilities 
  latent in such a situation. A collapse of the Labour government - even though 
  a section of the petty bourgeoisie and backward workers might be temporarily 
  stampeded to the right - would prepare the advanced workers for a sharp swing 
  left, and thus polarise the two camps, bourgeoisie and proletariat. In addition 
  to which, such a background of a temporary upswing of British capitalism, led 
  to a comparative tranquillity of class relations up to the period just prior 
  to the war. Far from tranquillising the class relations, such a victory for 
  the Tories would precipitate the working class on the road of open class battles. 
  Those sections of the population, temporarily stampeded in the direction of 
  the Tories, would swiftly react even more violently both to the left and to 
  the right.</p>


<p>The collapse of the traditional capitalist parties would be accelerated and 
  the Conservatives suffer the fate of the Liberals. But this is the perspective 
  of the future.</p>


<h4>The Labour Government</h4>

<p>Despite the difficulties at home and abroad, the Labour Party has attained 
  power at a favourable period from the standpoint of short-term perspective. 
  We anticipated that the coming to power of the Labour government would precipitate 
  tremendous struggles on the part of the working class. We also anticipated large 
  scale battles on the industrial field, with tremendous pressure on the Labour 
  government. Had Labour come to power under conditions of industrial crisis and 
  slump, undoubtedly the pressure of the workers for measures in their interests 
  would have been insistent and immediate. Political developments would have been 
  speeded up inside and outside the Labour Party.</p>


<p>It is necessary to make a correction in this short-term prognosis. As in the 
  economic field, where long-term perspectives were telescoped with the short-term, 
  so this was reflected in our political prognosis. We anticipated that the coming 
  to power of the Labour government would almost immediately open up a situation 
  of political crisis in the country. On the international and national arena, 
  the class struggle has developed at a slower tempo and the decisive clashes 
  have not yet taken place. Consequently political trends have developed in a 
  somewhat different fashion. Because of the circumstances outlined above, the 
  crisis will, in fact, have a more drawn out and delayed character.</p>


<p>The long-term perspectives remain that of crisis and collapse for the Labour 
  government. But unless we correct our analysis, the Party will be disoriented 
  in the coming period. While a series of minor and even important crises are 
  inevitable, these political crises will not be of such a fundamental character 
  as to shake the Labour Party from top to bottom, or pose the question of its 
  downfall because of the movement of the masses in a revolutionary direction 
  in the immediate period. Consequently there cannot and will not be a speedy 
  polarisation within the Labour Party.</p>


<p>That the masses are critical of the Labour government is undoubted. But they 
  are tolerant and are prepared to extend a large credit of time to the Labour 
  government. The British masses are traditionally slow to change. Only big events 
  will cause them to break with reformism. The masses feel keenly the burdens 
  of food shortages and rationing, the vagaries of the black market, etc, and 
  they are well aware that the bourgeoisie are still doing quite well under the 
  Labour government. But they largely accept the argument of the Labour leaders 
  that these conditions cannot immediately be alleviated because of the inheritance 
  of the war and its aftermath.</p>


<p>Despite new restrictions which cause grumblings and a certain exasperation 
  with the Labour government, these are not sufficient to provoke a real movement 
  of revolt against the Labour leadership. Meanwhile, the acute shortages can 
  only be temporary. Conditions will undoubtedly improve over what they have been 
  in the war years. Already clothing, household utensils and other consumer goods 
  are appearing on the market in increasing quantities. This process will be accelerated 
  in the next few years. Notwithstanding the decrease of wartime earnings, the 
  conditions of the British working class remain on a bearable level.</p>


<p>The undoubted economic boom masks the fact that no fundamental measures against 
  capitalism are being taken by the Labour government. We are in a classic period 
  of reformist illusions - a reformist government coining to power at a period 
  of economic boom. Small reforms and semi-reforms tend to lull the masses with 
  the perspective of a slow but steady improvement in their conditions.</p>


<p>In 1929, the Labour government operated in a period of slump and could not 
  carry out anything of its declared programme, but on the contrary was forced 
  to initiate counter-reforms on the pretext that it was not in a majority. Today, 
  the Labour government rides in power at the crest of a tremendous wave of radicalisation 
  seldom seen in British history, when the bourgeoisie lack confidence in their 
  own future. The Labour government, with the agreement of sections of the capitalist 
  class, is proceeding to nationalise coal and other industries for the purpose 
  of modernising and preserving the structure of British capitalism. It is actually 
  carrying out, in part, its declared election programme. In the eyes of the masses, 
  this reconciles them to sacrifices because they have illusions in the 'theory' 
  of a gradual and painless transition to socialism.</p>


<p>The fact that the illusion of 'full employment' can be maintained in the present 
  period of boom; that, apart from the nationalisation measures, other reforms 
  and semi-reforms have been introduced by the Labour government - National Health 
  Bill, old age pensions, the housing plan, abolition of the Trade Disputes Act 
  - these have served to assure the masses that the government is making a serious 
  effort to do the job for which it was elected.</p>


<p>The policy in Greece and Indonesia aroused trepidation and misgivings among 
  the workers. But the weakness of British imperialism, which dictates concessions 
  to the colonial bourgeoisie in Egypt and India, enables the Labour leaders to 
  cover their reactionary policy as though it was a genuine liberation of these 
  peoples and a blow against imperialism. This is especially the case since the 
  Tories have in words greeted with criticisms and dismay this 'liquidation of 
  the Empire'</p>


<p>Because mass unemployment will only begin towards the end of Labour's term 
  in office, and because of all the other factors referred to above, it is quite 
  likely that not only will the Labour government see through its term of office, 
  but that we may see a second Labour government.</p>


<p>The most likely course of events, therefore, would appear to be a slow tempo 
  of development. But this is partly dependent upon events abroad. The development 
  of the class struggle in France to the point of civil war, or the outbreak of 
  revolution in India, could speed the process in Britain.</p>


<h4>Swing to the Right in the Labour Party</h4>

<p>The conjunction of circumstances has resulted in a deep political lull among 
  the masses. This is reflected in the Labour Party as a political <em>swing to 
  the right.</em></p>


<p>The Labour organisations which tended to revive after the election are largely 
  quiescent or dormant. The left-wing leadership has fused with the right wing, 
  the most prominent leaders taken into the cabinet and given government posts. 
  Even the incipient left wing has been dispersed at this stage. The 'Victory 
  for Socialism' group has collapsed. The circulation of left labour publications 
  such as <em>Tribune </em>and <em>Forward </em>has sharply declined.</p>


<p>There is much less political life in the Labour Parties than before the war. 
  This is the general tendency while there are exceptions mainly in the rural 
  areas. <em>Until the economic situation changes and a left wing with prominent 
  Labour figures develops inside the Labour Party, the general tendency will be 
  for political life in the Labour Party not to increase but to remain at a low 
  level.</em></p>


<p>This is the honeymoon period for the Labour bureaucracy. A symptom of the processes 
  within the Labour Party was the overwhelming defeat of the Stalinist application 
  for affiliation, largely on the grounds that it stood for 'red revolution and 
  communism'. Undoubtedly the anti-Russian campaign had a certain effect which 
  was helped by Stalin's policy in the occupied areas. It was not mainly because 
  of the reactionary features of Stalinism that the swing against CP affiliation 
  took place, although this undoubtedly assisted the Labour leaders; it was because 
  of the reactionary campaign of the Labour leaders against communism and the 
  renewed illusions in reformism. Only a handful of Labour Party branches throughout 
  the whole country supported affiliation resolutions.</p>


<p>In our last conference document we stated:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;It is quite likely that the leaders of the left wing such as Aneurin 
  Bevan will go over directly to the side of the right wing, accepting posts in 
  the government. Thus the left wing, completely scattered and disorganised, will 
  get even less of a national expression in the immediate period ahead. However, 
  events will lead to the crystallisation of a new left wing in which sections 
  of the newer and younger MPs in parliament will play a leading role.&quot; (RCP 
  conference resolutions, August, 1945)</p>


<p>Such a crystallisation is inevitable and will most likely take place at a time 
  of political crisis of the whole regime which will come with the development 
  of the economic slump.</p>


<h4>Class Struggle in the Industrial Field</h4>

<p>Meanwhile, the struggle between the workers and the employers will largely 
  take place in the industrial field. These struggles will, in the long run, reflect 
  themselves in the political field, inside the Labour Party. But not immediately; 
  not as a direct and automatic process. The most important industrial struggles 
  for many years - the dock strike, the movement of the London building trades 
  workers, the engineers, and more recently, the tin-plate strike in South Wales 
  - all of these movements passed by without affecting the <em>internal </em>life 
  of the Labour Parties on a local or national scale.</p>


<p>While tolerating the Labour government in the hope of benefits to come, and 
  satisfied that nearly all have work, the economic boom will invest the workers 
  with confidence. They will attempt to iinprove their hours and conditions by 
  a direct struggle against the employers. The epidemic of little strikes, even 
  in those industries where no strike struggles have taken place for a generation 
  (tin-plate workers), and among the most exploited sections (dairy workers), 
  is an indication that hitherto unaffected strata of the workers will be brought 
  into the struggle. The strikes in cotton, engineering, shipbuilding and other 
  basic industries against victimisations of trade-union militants, is an instinctive 
  preparation in which the workers are defending their organisations for the battles 
  to come. (At the present stage, large numbers of these strikes revolve around 
  the issue of workers' control of hiring and firing, in which the workers express 
  what will later be the tendency to workers' control of production.)</p>


<p>Strikes of a scope such as have never been seen before in Britain will take 
  place. At this stage, the ruling class will be forced to give small concessions 
  to the masses in wages and conditions. The miners are expecting great results 
  and benefits from the nationalisation of the pits. They are demanding concessions: 
  many will be given to them. Without concessions, the ruling class and the Labour 
  government would be faced with a series of gigantic battles in the coalfields, 
  once the miners realise the fraud of the reformist nationalisation measures.</p>


<p>However, the slump will take away all the secondary reforms and improvements 
  and entirely transform the character of the struggle.</p>


<p>In the industrial struggles which will take place in the interim, the Labour 
  government will support the employers against the militant elements of the working 
  class. This will inevitably arouse a deep hostility from the left to the Labour 
  government, <em>and even to the Labour Party. </em>While in the past the Labour 
  Party was the mass alternative to the existing government in power, it was inevitable 
  that the workers should turn to the Labour Party as an organised mass political 
  force directed against the Tories, against the government of the day. But it 
  is not easy to conceive of the growth of a new mass orientation towards the 
  Labour Party, or growing confidence in the Labour Party, in a period when the 
  Labour government is supporting the capitalists against the workers in strike 
  struggles.</p>


<p>Meanwhile, the trade-union apparatus will become further integrated into the 
  state apparatus and organisations of joint production and class collaboration. 
  This tendency will be accompanied by a growing hostility to the policy of class 
  collaboration and the crystallisation of an organised movement of opposition.</p>


<p>The Militant Workers' Federation<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup> failed to strike roots and grow as a centre for trade-union 
  opposition during the war and immediately following its conclusion, and it is 
  now clear that the industrial opposition will find a different organisational 
  expression.</p>


<p>The experience of the great dock strike and of the building trades movement 
  indicates that the workers will throw up unofficial co-ordinating organisations 
  for the purpose of directing their struggle against the employers and overcoming 
  the sabotage of the union leaderships. The Party must constantly seek to integrate 
  itself with these co-ordinating bodies and to link them up on a regional and 
  national scale. At the same time, the Party must seek, as it did in the past, 
  to find the maximum expression, support and organisation for these unofficial 
  movements through the trade-union organisation as a whole.</p>


<p>It is from the industrial field and the trade unions that the militant and 
  growing class opposition will find its first important expression in opposition 
  to the Labour government. The task of our Party is to seek that opposition wherever 
  it arises, and to try to give it a correct industrial and political orientation. 
  It is in the industrial field, therefore, from industrial militants (among them 
  Labour and CP members and sympathisers) that the Revolutionary Communist Party 
  will make its most important gains in the period that opens up.</p>


<h4>Nationalisation</h4>

<p>Under the influence of the impasse of British imperialism, and the powerful 
  pressure of the working class, the Labour leaders have gone further on the road 
  of carrying through their election programme than we anticipated. Nationalisation 
  of the mines is already accomplished. Steel, electricity, transport and fuel, 
  sections of the basic industries on which the economic structure of the country 
  rests, are apparently to be nationalised. However, the method and form in which 
  statification is being accomplished - with compensation and without workers' 
  control - is a compromise with the bourgeoisie as a whole, and is carried out 
  in agreement with important sections of the bourgeoisie. The nationalisation 
  of the Bank of England merely made <em>de jure </em>what was already <em>de facto. 
  </em>These are measures of state capitalism and not of socialism.</p>


<p>All these steps show the increasing tendency towards the fusion of finance 
  capital with the state. It is not an accident that the most serious representatives 
  of the capitalist class, reflected in <em>The Times </em>and <em>The Economist, 
  </em>are supporting the nationalisation of those industries that have become 
  a drag on the British economy as a whole.</p>


<p>These serious representatives of the ruling class are willing to accept the 
  taking over of these industries by the state - even with Labour in power - as 
  the best method of bringing about the necessary measures of rationalisation 
  and placing the burdens on the shoulders of the masses. By means of state rationalisation 
  they hope to gain efficient and cheap coal, electricity, steel, fuel and transport, 
  in order more effectively to compete on the world market. The capitalists are 
  becoming reconciled to the terms of compensation and the manner in which the 
  change is being accomplished. Their acceptance of these measures is a reflection 
  of the decay of British capitalism; the lack of confidence of the capitalist 
  class in its future; its weakness in face of the working class; its desperation 
  to seek a solution. Ten years ago, when the bourgeoisie were endowed with more 
  confidence in the future of their system, suggestions of such measures would 
  have been greeted with savage opposition.</p>


<p>From the standpoint of economic development, state capitalism is a step forward 
  from <em>laissez-faire </em>or monopoly capitalism. But it is not socialism. <em>The 
  state remains a capitalist state. </em>Nationalised industry will be run for 
  the benefit of the ruling class as a whole, not in the interests of the working 
  class. The shareholders are to be richly rewarded with lavish compensation, 
  although they brought the country to the edge of economic ruin. The industries 
  are to be run as state capitalist corporations, largely staffed with their former 
  capitalist owners and managers. The workers will have no control in the running 
  of these industries, and will thus find themselves in the same position as the 
  Post Office workers have been for the past generations.</p>


<p>The Leninist demand: 'Nationalisation without compensation under workers' control' 
  assumes the character of a basic demand in the coming period. The workers in 
  nationalised industry must demand that from top to bottom they should be managed 
  and controlled by committees elected by the workers, to which technical experts 
  would be attached.</p>


<p>While consistently exposing the partial and reformist character of the policy 
  of the Labour government, and advocating the revolutionary programme, we defend 
  even those partial measures against any attempt of the Tories to return to individual 
  capitalist ownership. But it would be a crime to create illusions among the 
  workers as to the meaning of these state capitalist measures. Our propaganda 
  must stress that half-and-half measures are inadequate to meet the needs of 
  the working class, and illusions created by the Labour leaders will lead the 
  workers to disaster.</p>


<p>It is impossible to plan and take advantage of the enormous potentialities 
  of modern production in the interests of the masses, without destroying capitalism 
  and taking over finance and all big industry without compensation, and without 
  the active and conscious intervention and democratic participation of the proletariat 
  in the running of industry and the country.</p>


<p>The measures taken by the Labour government will temporarily assist in the 
  alleviation of the capitalist crisis, but it cannot solve it. In the inevitable 
  economic crisis which the continued existence of capitalism will bring, and 
  which the nationalisation measures will not avert, the very conception of nationalisation 
  will be discredited in the eyes of the masses. Large sections of the middle 
  class and the more desperate section of the capitalist class, will be pushed 
  onto the road of fascism. This debacle of reformism will, however, inevitably 
  prepare the way for the revolutionisation of the masses, as in the days of their 
  Chartist forefathers.</p>


<h4>The Decline of the Independent Labour Party</h4>

<p>The failure of the ILP to gain affiliation to the Labour Party resulted not 
  so much from the fear that the ILP would form an independent left wing within 
  the Labour Party, as from the unholy fear of the affiliation of the Communist 
  Party. The Labour leaders had no desire to accept ILP affiliation, which would 
  thus have assisted the CP to that end. This has resulted in the degeneration 
  of the ILP to the point where its very future existence, even as a sect, is 
  imperilled.</p>


<p>A continuous process of splintering has occurred which has decimated the organisation. 
  Leaders and members alike lack a principled political base and a clear historical 
  perspective. It is this, primarily, that has led to the present disintegration.</p>


<p>The ILP could only have survived or played an important historical role if 
  it had worked out a revolutionary policy, or if it had entered the Labour Party, 
  where it would have become the organisational-political base for the growth 
  of a left wing in the mass party. But it had already lost any revolutionary 
  possibilities before the end of the war.</p>


<p>The collapse of the ILP has strikingly confirmed the prognosis of our last 
  Party conference that:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;As a current spearate and apart from the reformists and revolutionaries, 
  the ILP will not be able to maintain itself. Like its brother parties on the 
  continent of Europe it will disappear ignominiously from the scene.&quot; (RCP 
  conference resolutions, August 1945)</p>


<p>True, the ILP has not yet disappeared, although <em>for all practical purposes 
  it has ceased to play the slightest role in British political life. </em>The 
  defection of Fenner Brockway<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup> will speed up the process 
  of disintegration. It will be a few short months before the remnants of its 
  parliamentary wing will break and openly enter the Labour Party.</p>


<p>The rump of the ILP can still vegetate for a few years to come. But a much 
  more likely perspective is that it will fuse with the rump of Common Wealth. 
  Even in this event there is no future for the ILP as an important factor in 
  the ranks of the working class.</p>


<h4>Stalinism in the Coming Period</h4>

<p>Unlike its brother parties on the continent of Europe, the British Stalinist 
  Party failed to secure the leadership of the majority or even a considerable 
  proportion of the working class. The workers clung to their traditional mass 
  organisation, the Labour Party. Nevertheless, it did secure the leadership of 
  <em>the most courageous and influential industrial and political militants </em>in 
  the years before the war and in the period of anti-war activity. The result 
  was an influential penetration of some of the most important trade unions in 
  the country. This was an important capital, an accumulation from years of self-sacrificing 
  activity by these militants, gained despite the false political line of the 
  leadership.</p>


<p>The incredible switches of party policy which took place overnight and without 
  discussion, the strike-breaking activity of the party during the latter part 
  of the war, and especially since its end, have served to disillusion the best 
  and most critical elements of the party. For the first time a bridge exists 
  from the Trotskyist party to these militants.</p>


<p>Our theoretical criticism of Stalinism in the plane of international politics 
  had not succeeded in gaining a hearing among these workers in the past. It was 
  in the course of their own experiences - the effects of the strike-breaking 
  activities of their own party - that these worker Stalinists began to comprehend 
  the fruits of 'socialism in one country'.</p>


<p>For the first time, serious fissures opened up within the British Communist 
  Party. A continuation of the open class-collaborationist line would have led 
  to splits and significant resignations. Only the lack of a mass base in our 
  own party rendered it possible for the leadership of the CP to prevent a serious 
  split.</p>


<p>A new turn on the part of the Communist Party, however, a turn which appears 
  to be definitely to the left, but which depends upon the agreements between 
  Molotov and Bevin for its further evolution, will halt that process for the 
  time being and cement these critical elements to the Communist Party again.</p>


<p>The Communist Party was shaken from top to bottom as a result of the general 
  election. The worker elements, already in opposition to the pro-Churchill line, 
  were disgusted by the general election policy which argued the impossibility 
  of a Labour victory without the support of the 'progressive Tories and Liberals'. 
  The results of the election demoralised them. Many of the petit bourgeois and 
  most backward sections who approved of the line of class collaboration, tended 
  to drift towards the Labour Party or to inactivity. Many of the best elements 
  lapsed into apathy and left the party. Nevertheless, the Stalinists recovered 
  from the effects of this crisis because of their tremendous machine, their basis 
  in the factories and unions, and the substantial section of militants who still 
  clung to the party.</p>


<p>A further setback for the Stalinists was the overwhelming defeat they suffered, 
  not only in the factories but in the unions, on the question of affiliation 
  to the Labour Party. Even where the executive supported affiliation (AEU, Mineworkers) 
  when the issue was carried to the rank and file, it was overwhelmingly defeated. 
  The AEU conference endorsed the decision of the Labour Party conference on this 
  issue.</p>


<p>Because of the general political stagnation and the tendencies among the masses, 
  unless Stalinist policy swings left, the decline of the CP will continue. The 
  defeat on affiliation has left the Stalinist leadership with no alternative 
  but to manoeuvre to give their policy as 'left' a coloration as possible, while 
  its content has remained the same.</p>


<p>Nevertheless, this turn to the left and participation in a militant struggle 
  will bring about certain difficulties for the leadership of the Communist Party. 
  It will not be possible to separate their militants from the Trotskyists in 
  the course of common action in the industrial field. The Trotskyists, moreover, 
  have a <em>consistent policy. </em>Only they will seek to draw the necessary class 
  lessons from individual struggles, and push these struggles to their logical 
  conclusions. Common action in the industrial field will fuse the Trotskyists 
  in comradeship with the rank and file of the Communist Party, and create the 
  necessary conditions to enable us to counterpose our policy to that of the Stalinists.</p>


<p>Disillusionment with the policy of the Labour government will inevitably lead 
  to a turn toward communist sentiments among the working class. To prevent that 
  revolutionary sentiment being dissipated by Stalinism, and to turn it into a 
  real struggle for communism, is the task of the RCP.</p>


<p>In spite of the setbacks which the Communist Party may experience in the immediate 
  period ahead, at a time of crisis for the Labour government, the swing of large 
  sections of the workers to the Communist Party as a temporary phase is inevitable. 
  This could only be avoided by a swift and powerful growth of the revolutionary 
  party which could offer an alternative.</p>


<p>Trotsky explained that the processes on the continent of Europe reflect themselves 
  in Britain, though with some delay. In the same way as the finest strata of 
  the European working class (even in the traditionally reformist countries) have 
  swung to the Communist Parties, so we will see a like process in Britain. Mass 
  unemployment in Britain, while a swift growth of the productive forces in the 
  Soviet Union will be taking place simultaneously, cannot but influence the workers 
  and precipitate an enormous swing towards the CP. This is especially the case 
  as we will have a Labour Party with an overwhelming majority in parliament. 
  Illusions in reformism, which still remained after the last world slump, will 
  be dissipated among wide sections of the workers in the coming slump.</p>


<p>This process will undoubtedly be assisted by the fact that the Stalinists pursue 
  a quasi-oppositional role to the Labour government. To the extent that discontent 
  with the Labour government increases among the industrial workers, they will 
  undoubtedly manipulate their policy and begin the preparation of the development 
  of a mass base.</p>


<p>It is a fact of great significance that all the outstanding representatives 
  of finance capital evaluate the coming developments in this direction. Eden, 
  Churchill, Quintin Hogg and others foresee with dread that this will be one 
  of the results of the coming disillusionment in the Labour government.</p>
