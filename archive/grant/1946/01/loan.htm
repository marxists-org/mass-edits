The
announcement of the terms of the loan of 3,750,000,000 dollars from America, of
which 650,000,000 dollars will be full and final settlement of lend-lease, has
been met with dismay by the ruling class. And the Labour leaders, who have accepted
the measure and pushed it through parliament, have swallowed it as a
disagreeable and bitter pill.
</p>
<p>
The most
important provisions tie British currency, in effect, to the dollar thus
confirming the dominant financial role of Wall Street. By preventing Britain, through the Bretton Woods agreement,
from devaluating her currency beyond certain specified limits, America hopes to curtail Britain&#8217;s competitive powers in the
export trade. Britain
will be prevented from under-cutting by selling her goods cheaper through this
device.
</p>
<p>
It is
noteworthy, however, that all the negotiations for the loan were carried
through by the direct representatives of the capitalists, Lord Halifax, Lord
Keynes, the permanent officials at the Treasury, etc. Thus the policy adopted
was the policy suggested by the servants of Big Business.
</p>
<p>
However, the
agreement has gone through with groans and gnashing of teeth, and the
ostentatious &#8220;abstention&#8221; of one section of the Tories, while another has voted
against. By this means they wish to unload the responsibility for the agreement
onto the shoulders of the Labour Government, though when challenged they could
not offer any alternative policy. Churchill admitted that not to have accepted
the terms would have meant an instant fight to the finish, a trade war which
British capitalism was not in a position to wage, and in which she would
inevitably be worsted.
</p>
<p>
The American
Imperialists have made a hard bargain. All the appeals and supplications of
British Imperialism to their &#8220;Allies in the common fight&#8221; have had the same
effect as the appeals to British Imperialism in the days of her might. America has
emerged victorious from the war as the greatest Power on earth and is dealing
with British capitalism, in the words of one Tory M.P., as &#8220;a defeated nation&#8221;.
The real aims of the war are revealed in the post-war struggle between the
Powers. Having used British capitalism to help defeat her most powerful and
greatest rival, Germany, America wishes to drive British Imperialism to its
knees, to become a satellite of the U.S., living on the rations doled out by
America and completely dependent upon her.
</p>
<p>
During the
course of the war, the American Imperialists have taken advantage to strip Britain of the
accumulated loot and plunder of the exploitation of the world, which has been
piled up for generations. Before Lend-lease was introduced, the reserves in
dollars and gold of British imperialism dropped in 1941 to only &#163;3,000,000.
Lend-lease was not an Act of generosity as Churchill pretended, but the fruits
of cold calculation. The American Imperialists saw that it was to their
advantage to subsidise Britain
in the struggle, just as Britain,
when she was the world&#8217;s banker, financed other countries to fight wars in her
interest in the past.
</p>
<p>
And during the
course of the war America
has become economically stronger; Britain economically weaker. While America&#8217;s wealth increased tremendously, Britain&#8217;s
wealth has decreased by the staggering figure of 25 percent. Britain has in
the past had to import more than she exported, but the adverse balance was made
up out of the income from investments abroad, shipping, insurance and banking.
Now these sources of income, whereby British capitalism extorted tribute,
especially from the colonial peoples have in great measure been lost. As the <em>Economist</em>
expresses the position:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;All of these credit items have been affected
during the war. The export trade was deliberately abandoned so that manpower,
production and materials could be mobilised to the fullest extent, with the
result that it shrank to less than one-third of its pre-war volume, and is
expected in 1946 to cover not more than half the country&#8217;s essential
expenditure on a minimum volume of imports and on other necessary payments
overseas&#8230;
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;As a result of losses, shipping tonnage, after
allowance has been made for new building in the war, is less than
three-quarters of the pre-war figure.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Owing to the extensive liquidation of foreign
securities, the repatriation of loans by overseas debtors and the increased
interest payments to holders of sterling debts caused by the United Kingdom&#8217;s
heavy war expenditure overseas, the net income from overseas investments in
1945 will be less than half the 1938 figure.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Thus on the
basis of capitalism, Britain
found herself in a desperate position. She lacks necessary food and raw
materials, her industry requires modernising and re-equipping to stand even a
chance of competing in the markets of the world. She could not possibly make up
her deficit of imports over exports without a loan from America unless
the standard of living was reduced immediately to coolie level. But this would
have provoked <em>immediately</em> a fight to the finish battle for export
markets with America, which Britain is not in a position to wage
successfully at this stage, and the danger of social crisis and revolution in Britain.
Clearly the masses would not tolerate such an outcome of the sacrifices of the
war. It is their hopeless position, their helplessness, which has forced
British Imperialism to go cap in hand, humbly to the Wall St. Bankers.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Economist</em>
estimates optimistically:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;It is hoped that work on export orders will have
attained the pre-war level by the second half of 1946, but the period of
production and the time lag in payment mean that cash receipts will not
correspond until after the end of the year. Moreover, reconversion so rapid as
this must be regarded as optimistic.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Any estimate of the 1946 balance of payments would be
so precarious in view of the large uncertainties affecting many of the factors
involved that detailed estimates are not provided. But, on the assumption that
the price level of exports and imports will be about double the pre-war level
in terms of sterling, the deficit is estimated at something like &#163;750 million.
A further deficit of &#163;500 million is likely for 1947 and 1948 taken together,
and there is likely to be a small deficit in 1949 and 1950 before stable
equilibrium is achieved.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;The cumulative deficit is thus likely to be
&#163;1,250 million or more&#8212;though it should be emphasised again that these
estimates are precarious&#8212;and to meet it, and to release some part of the
sterling balances, the United Kingdom will have to rely on its own reserves
and, in the main, further external credits.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
In reality,
even these figures are unlikely to be reached and the deficit is likely to be
even greater. The British capitalists will probably find that the credit they
have obtained from America will melt away in vitally necessary purchases, even
in a couple of years, leaving Britain in as difficult a position as that which
drove her to seek succour from the United States capitalists.
</p>
<p>
Because of
her loss of investments, etc., even to maintain her pre-war position would mean
Herculean efforts beyond the power of British capitalism. The <em>Economist</em>
explains:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;It has long been a commonplace that British exports
will have to be increased by 50 percent above their 1938 volume; the financial
burdens now assumed raise the figure to 75 percent. In 1938 the exports of the
United Kingdom were just over 10 percent of the world total, so that if they
are to rise by three-quarters an extra volume of trade must be won equal to 7.5
percent of the world total, either by taking it away from others or by securing
the lion&#8217;s share of any likely increase in the total. This by itself would be a
gigantic task. But it understates the real problem. The whole of the increase
will necessarily be concentrated on manufactures, and if the total is to rise
by 75 percent the volume of manufactured exports, which were 72 percent of the
total before the war, will have to rise by just over 100 per cent. But British
manufactured exports in 1937 amounted to 19 percent of the world total in this
category. In short, in this decisive field, the British task is to secure
additional markets equal to one-fifth of the whole international trade of the
world.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
This is
clearly impossible. Ostensibly the loan agreement is intended to tide Britain over a
period when she cannot compete, till her economy becomes &#8220;normal&#8221; through the
switchover from war to peace production. But the irony of it lies in the fact
that in return for this assistance America
is utilising the position to gain admission to markets where Britain was
formerly dominant. The sterling bloc by means of which Britain preserved large
markets in the Dominions, Colonies, and certain other countries which were
compelled by this means to buy goods in Britain in return for British purchases
of food and raw materials, has been broken. By forcing Britain to make dollars available to them, America makes
it possible in the immediate future to penetrate the markets of the Colonies
and Dominions.
</p>
<p>
Britain&#8217;s greatest
weapon in the trade struggle of being the greatest market in the world is
rendered futile because she cannot directly bargain on the basis of an
immediate exchange of goods which would come under the heading of
discrimination. She cannot increase her purchases of any raw materials or goods
from the Colonies or Dominions while decreasing the purchase of the same goods
from America
as this would come under the same heading. America
is in a position to supply goods and machinery immediately or almost
immediately and in many cases <em>cheaper</em> than Britain which could only supply the
goods urgently required only after a long delay, consequently her former
markets will be under constant American pressure. This with no real
corresponding concessions on the part of Yankee Imperialism. The <em>Economist</em>
cries out:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;In short, those devices (of trade) which could be
used by Britain
to its advantage are banned with the greater degree of explicitness; those that
assist American exports with the greater degrees of vagueness.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Thus British
capitalism is in the position of a starving athlete preparing for a race, who
accepts food from a competitor in return for allowing his arms and legs to be
hobbled together when he runs. Not for nothing has America announced a programme of
trebling her exports! But even if the world market increases somewhat it will
not be big enough to satisfy the Imperialisms of Britain and America, let
alone the lesser struggling Powers. The trade war is on, only the British
capitalists have begun on such a weakened position that they have been
compelled to surrender without a battle for the time being.
</p>
<p>
However, it
can be predicted in advance that the Agreement will break down. It is
impossible for bankrupt British capitalism to fulfil it. The <em>Economist</em>
openly declares:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;It is very difficult to understand how any man in his
senses can think that the obligations now to be assumed can possibly be fulfilled.
It is not the annuity of &#163;35 million to America that is so frightening, but
the chronic deficit of at least ten times that amount that would seem to be the
all but inevitable consequence of the subsidiary conditions.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
The spokesmen
of American capitalism know very well that Britain will never be in a position
to pay back the loan. But they have a double objective in making it. By
allowing a certain amount of consumers and other goods into Britain and
thus finding markets which their enormous surplus production urgently needs
they stave off an immediate social crisis of British capitalism. Such a crisis
would lead to revolutionary struggles throughout Europe, and would have
immediate repercussions in Asia and the
colonial world thus leading to the danger of the complete overthrow of world
capitalism. At the same time American Imperialism needs Britain as a counter-balance to Russia in Europe.
Simultaneously they drive into Britain&#8217;s
most sacred preserve and her last line of defence against the American trading
offensive: her Empire Markets.
</p>
<p>
The whole of
the capitalist press unanimously shrieks &#8220;Woe, woe&#8221;; both the Labour leaders
and the Conservatives, those for the agreement and those against agree on its
disastrous effects in the long run for Britain. But even those who protest
have no real alternative to offer. <em>On the basis of capitalism there is no
other alternative but to accept the domination of American imperialism</em>. The
<em>Economist</em> grimly but sadly sums it up in a very apt way: &#8220;All this, no
doubt, is unavoidable. Beggars can&#8217;t be choosers. But they can, by long
tradition, put a curse on the ambitions of the rich!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The
capitalists prefer that it should be the Labour leaders who incur the odium of
doing the dirty work and bowing the knee to American Imperialism. The
consequences for the masses will be hard in the next few years. As Mr. Eccles
the Tory M.P. for Chippenham remarked with evident satisfaction:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;From these unsatisfactory documents we secure one
great advantage. From now onwards there cannot be a man or woman in the country
who does not see that the export trade is the nation&#8217;s first priority, and that
all the other sound objectives of policy that were listed at the General
Election, housing, nationalization, social reform and the rest, must now step
down to make way for exports.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
The
capitalists wish to place the full burdens of the crisis onto the shoulders of
the working class. And the Labour Government by pursuing a capitalist way out
of the crisis make it inevitable that <em>the real standard of living must fall</em>.
That is why the building workers and the Dockers have received such grudging
increases! But the intensification of labour which the capitalists, the Union and Labour leaders and the Stalinists are all
simultaneously demanding, speed-up and rationalisation, will not solve any of
the problems of British capitalism. With or without the agreement with America
such a policy would and can only prepare the way for a new and more terrifying
slump than in 1929-1934 which led to intense misery for the masses and the fall
of the Labour Government. No one in the Parliamentary debate could deny the
fact that a terrible slump would follow the present boom in America and that it would spread to Britain. A
point that was made by many speakers in the debate. Such an economic crisis
with a weakened economy would mean mass unemployment, even further lowered
standards, and general misery for the masses. <em>These will be the fruits of
the policy now being pursued by the Labour Government</em>.
</p>
<p>
But what is
the alternative many sincere Labour workers will ask? There is only one way
out. If instead of pursuing this shameful policy of capitulation to the City of
London and Wall
Street the Labour leaders pursued a real revolutionary Socialist policy, a
Leninist policy, the situation would be entirely changed. <em>The first step
would be to take over the banks and all industry without compensation to the
capitalists and run them under workers&#8217; control</em>. Then on the basis of
having instituted as in Russia
a State monopoly of foreign trade, the industry and trade both at home and
abroad could be organised and planned. Even if the American capitalists
attempted economic reprisals the workers would gladly accept sacrifices
temporarily (as they did when they believed they were fighting against
fascism), when they realised it would mean a world of undreamed of plenty and
peace, of rising standards for them and their children. A Socialist Britain
could appeal to the Russian, American, European and Asian workers to come to
their assistance.
</p>
<p>
This is the
only realistic policy for the British working class. The other way leads to the
collapse of decrepit British capitalism, to untold sufferings and hardship, to
slump and finally fascism and war. The capitalists will utilise the services of
the Labour leaders and then cast them aside. A new crisis and a new 1931
debacle is inevitable if the present policy of the Government is persisted in.
</p>
<p>
Labour
workers, Communist workers, this economic agreement is an ominous warning!
Prepare now for the battles that lie ahead. Compromise with capitalism at home
or abroad can only lead to disaster. Only in the overthrow of capitalism can
the working class find a way out of the anarchy, chaos and nightmare of
capitalism. Only the Revolutionary Communist Party tells you the truth and
warns of the debacle that lies ahead for the Labour Government. Remember in the
future and support the Party that forewarned and forearmed you for the battles
that lie ahead.
