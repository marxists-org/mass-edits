<p class="fst">
In
the last few weeks, news <span class="inote">[has reached]</span> us of the new wave of purges in Russia which is
affecting all strata of the lower <span class="inote">[layers]</span> of the bureaucracy. Managers in
industry are being dismissed and replaced in thousands on charges of graft and
corruption, bureaucratism, incompetence, swindling and misuse of funds of the
state.
</p>
<p>
In
agriculture the collective farms are being purged. And a tremendous campaign
against &#8220;ideological&#8221; backsliding in a capitalist and nationalist direction in
literature, the arts, the press, cinema, science, the schools, the army, has
been begun at a signal from the Kremlin.
</p>
<p>
These
convulsions have shaken the political superstructure in the Soviet
Union. They are a reflection of the discontent of the population
after the great efforts and exertions of the masses during the war. The Soviet
population put up with greater hardships and endured greater privations than
any of the other main belligerents. Now, after the war is over they see that
the bureaucrats still intend to maintain their inflated standards of life,
while the Soviet peoples continue to exist on a level of hunger and privation
not much higher than their incredibly low standards during the war. The
corruption and degeneracy of the officials with whom the masses come in
contact&#8212;that is, the lower ranks of the bureaucracy who ape their superiors in
the hierarchy of officialdom right up to the Kremlin bosses&#8212;arouses their
disgust and antagonism.
</p>
<p>
Stalin
and his bureaucratic clique are, to a certain extent, leaning on the masses in
order to restore the pre-war equilibrium within the bureaucracy. The usual
Stalinist method is being employed: making scapegoats of the lower ranks for
carrying out a policy decided by the Kremlin. The nationalistic and middle
class ideology put forward during the war, glorifying the Czarist past of
Russia and deifying such oppressors of the Russian people as <em>Ivan the
Terrible</em> and <em>Peter the Great</em>, of such Czarist hangmen as the <em>Generals
Kutuzov</em> and <em>Suvurov</em>, this chauvinist ideology was ordered and
encouraged by the Kremlin in order to serve the needs and interests of the
bureaucracy itself.
</p>
<p>
But
while the masses could be reconciled to such chauvinistic and racial
outpourings about the superiority of the Slavs at a time when they were
directly menaced by the threats of German Fascism, they could not be inspired
to make further sacrifices for the Five Year Plan under this banner once peace
had been restored. The fruit of victory for the workers in Russia has been the perspective of harder and
harder toil under the regime of Stalin for the indefinite future, in order to
rebuild and expand the power and industry of the Soviet
Union. Thus, in the endeavour to reconcile the workers and
peasants to this, the bureaucracy has had to resurrect phrases about Socialism
and the society of the future. This also serves to lull the workers abroad, who
have become alarmed at the inequalities and sumptuous standards of the
bureaucracy, and by the iron dictatorial regime established by Stalinism. But
in reality nothing fundamental is changed. Only a different varnish is used.
</p>
<p>
A few
quotations will illustrate the process taking place. The foreign press reports
&#8220;Drastic purges&#8221; in the Communist Party of the Ukraine for &#8220;failure to make
careful selections of party and administrative personnel, a prevalence of
&#8216;bourgeois-nationalist ideology&#8217; among the intelligentsia and widespread
bribery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
According
to <em>Bolshevik</em> the &#8220;theoretical&#8221; journal of the Russian C.P., the
Stalinogorsk Coal Trust &#8220;never fulfilled its plan,&#8221; but simply inflated its
figures to make up monthly quotas, e.g. reported a daily production of 544 tons
when the real production was only 150 tons. (Quoted from <em>Time</em> Magazine
Sept. 9<sup>th</sup>).
</p>
<p>
<em>Le
Monde</em> reports
on September 13<sup>th</sup>, that Gorechenine, Soviet Attorney-General, has
started investigations, and <em>Pravda</em> comments: &#8220;The Party must play a
preponderant role in the re-establishment of national discipline.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The
Union of Writers of the U.S.S.R. has expelled the novelist Mikhail Zoschenko
and poetess Anna Ahkmatova, on charges of &#8220;apoliticalism&#8221;. The Central
Committee has attacked the entire cinema industry, particularly singling out
the Cinema Minister Bolchakov and Eisenstein, world-famous producer. The Arts
Committee which produced Soviet plays is accused &#8220;of having tried to poison the
consciousness of Soviet citizens with an ideology hostile to Soviet society, to
revive the residues of capitalism in people&#8217;s minds and customs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The
purge has been very extensive in agriculture. The <em>Times</em> of September 24<sup>th</sup>,
reports a Decree of the Council of Ministers and of the Central Committee of
the Soviet Union, signed by Stalin and Zhdanov
jointly:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;The
decree calls attention to the inflation of the managerial staff to the
detriment of the collective farms&#8217; distributable income; to misappropriation of
public lands on a mass scale through the extension of private allotments beyond
the legal limit and the allocation of common land to various local
organizations; to the pilfering of collective farm property by local State and
party officials, some of whom, it is stated, are dipping their hands into
collective property as if it were in their own pockets; and, finally to
slackness on many farms in holding general meetings and electing leaders, a
habit which is debarring workers from taking part in the farms&#8217; affairs.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;The
decree calls for a decisive end to these violations of the collective farm
charter and threatens offenders with prosecution under the criminal code. It
demands an immediate correction of abuses, including the expulsion from the
collective farms of all &#8216;drones&#8217; who fail to contribute a minimum quota of
labour, and, by cancelling a war-time measure, it brings to an end the practice
by which local authorities are empowered to take over common land for their own
subsidiary enterprises.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
This
indicates how far the collective farms had disintegrated under the pressure of
the war, the destruction of tractors and other agricultural implements, the
destruction on the land and the transforming of industry into producing almost
entirely war material. Under these conditions having to fall back on old
primitive methods and the individual plough, individualistic and small
capitalist tendencies were inevitably produced. More and more the most
energetic and grasping of the peasants began to seize tracts of land from the
collective and operate them as their own individual property. The
manager-bureaucrats on the land, in return for bribes, turned a blind eye upon
this development and many participated in it themselves.
</p>
<p>
But
the bureaucracy does not desire to share power with such elements. Moreover,
individual production is very uneconomic in comparison with giant collective
farms. The moment that the bureaucracy were in a position to do so, they have
turned upon the neo-kulaks. They were compelled to turn a blind eye while
industry was not producing sufficient tractors to serve the needs of the
collective farms. With the restoration of a certain measure of production, of
tractors combines and other mechanical agricultural implements, they have
launched a new campaign to restore the collective farms. All petty capitalist
tendencies within agriculture (it has not assumed any great importance for
industry) are to be ruthlessly crushed, as they were during the purge in
agriculture during the first Five Year Plan. And in this, undoubtedly the
bureaucracy will gain the support of the big majority of the workers and
peasants.
</p>
<p>
But
this does not mean that capitalist tendencies will be eliminated or curtailed.
On the contrary they will receive an impetus during the new Five Year Plan, but
in a different direction. Far from moving in a Socialist direction: towards
greater and greater equality and the abolition of privilege for the favoured
officialdom: this is to be increased during the next few years.
</p>
<p>
As
Lenin ceaselessly hammered, differences of this character are capitalist
differences which have nothing in common with Socialism. Yet <em>Labour Research</em>
controlled by the Communist Party, blatantly declares in its issue of July,
1946:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Certain
developments in Soviet organisation apparent before the war are emphasised in
this plan. Wage differentiation, a stimulus to efficiency and exhibition of
skill, is to increase within each industry&#8230; There is greater cash stimulus for
good work by technicians and organisers.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
The
sharpness of the measures in the Soviet Union demonstrate that even under the
totalitarian regime of Stalin the class struggle still goes on. The discontent
of the masses, particularly the soldiers, who have seen the lies and propaganda
of the bureaucracy exposed by the fact that the standard of living in the
countries they have invaded is higher than that in the Soviet Union; the
shortages and hunger, the further sacrifices for the building up of industry
while the difference between the masses and the bureaucrats becomes greater and
greater, produces a mood of bitterness and antagonism among the workers and
peasants. The repercussions of this social antagonism will have great
consequences in the long run. But meanwhile, the Stalinist regime will survive
the immediate crisis, and far from weakening the bureaucracy will strengthen
the hold which it has over the country temporarily. The masses do not see any
alternative in Russia
at the present time, and are fearful of intervention from the capitalist states
in the West.
</p>
<p>
The
Soviet economy will make giant strides despite the abuses of the bureaucracy, <em>because
of the superiority of state ownership and planned economy in comparison with
the private ownership of capitalist countries</em>. Consequently, these measures
taken to eliminate private ownership on the land, and the weeding out of
certain inefficiencies in production will assist the bureaucracy in overcoming
the difficulties inherited by the war and the excesses of the bureaucracy itself.
</p>
<p>
But
even great economic advances cannot solve the problems of the Soviet
Union. The menace of the capitalist differentiation within Soviet
society; the uncontrolled domination over the lives and destiny of the peoples
of the U.S.S.R. by the despotism of the Kremlin: the bureaucratic graft and
privileges; these arise out of the Stalinist system and will still remain. This
is not socialism. Only by the overthrow of the Stalinist bureaucracy and the
restoration of control by the workers within the Soviet Union,
will these capitalistic tendencies be curtailed and eliminated. But in this
task the workers will require the assistance and support of the international
working class.
</p>
<p>
The
real dilemma of the Bureaucracy and their method of overcoming it, is indicated
by the new position now outlined by Stalin in his interview with Alexander
Werth the correspondent of the <em>Sunday Times</em>. In a series of questions
obviously arranged by Stalin himself, he asked:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Do
you believe that with the further progress of the Soviet Union towards
Communism the possibilities of peaceful co-operation with the outside world
will not decrease as far as the Soviet Union
is concerned? Is &#8216;Communism in one Country&#8217; possible?&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Answer:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;I do
not doubt that the possibilities of peaceful co-operation far from decreasing
may even grow. &#8216;Communism in one country&#8217; is perfectly possible, especially in
a country like the Soviet Union.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
This
is a complete revision not only of Leninism, but the position held by the
Stalinists in the past. Stalin put forward the theory of &#8220;Socialism in one
Country&#8221; as the way out in his <em>Foundations of Leninism</em> for the first
time in 1924, throwing overboard all that Marx and Lenin, and what he himself
had put forward in the past.
</p>
<p>
Now,
according to Stalin, not Socialism, Communism can be achieved in a single
country. This conception has a dual purpose. On the one hand it is intended as
a re-assurance to Anglo-American Imperialism that the Soviet Bureaucracy has
not gone back to the programme of &#8220;Trotskyism&#8221;, and does not threaten the
overthrow of world imperialism but still wishes to compromise with it and is
still opposed to the proletarian revolution in the West. At the same time, it
reassures the Imperialists that the attacks on capitalism and the re-furbished
phrases about Socialism are only intended to fool the world and Russian working
class. On the other hand, simultaneously, a new means of reconciling the
Russian masses to their lot can be accomplished by this method.
</p>
<p>
The
fiction that socialism has been achieved in Russia sounds very hollow to the
overburdened Russian masses. Consequently, Stalin and the bureaucracy must hold
out some other perspective for the future. Having abandoned the perspective of
world revolution, the Stalinists cannot hold out any hopes to the Russian
masses of revolution in the West to come to their aid and assist in building a
new world for all. Stalin must develop &#8220;Communism&#8221; as the perspective before
the Soviet masses in order to try and get them to accept new sacrifices and new
burdens after the uninterrupted efforts and exertions of the last two decades.
</p>
<p>
But
the workers of the West, and the Russian workers, will have the last say. For
there is no solution other than <em>world communism</em>. Without aid from the
workers of other lands, without the extension of the October Revolution, Russia cannot
achieve a socialist system of society in isolation. That is what Marx taught.
That is what Lenin taught. That is what the Trotskyists teach.
