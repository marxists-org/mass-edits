Democracy or Bonapartism in Europe?</a> (November 1945)</span></p>


<p class="fst">Lenin's aphorism that we live in an epoch of wars and revolutions - to which 
  Trotsky added 'and counter-revolutions' - has been amply demonstrated by the 
  history of the last three decades. Few periods in history have been filled with 
  such terrific convulsions and clashes between the nations and classes and such 
  kaleidoscopic changes and manipulations of the political regimes whereby finance 
  capital maintains its domination over the peoples. Thus, it becomes doubly important 
  for those who carry on the scientific teachings of Marxism, and who alone can 
  lay claim to make a theoretical analysis of events, to keep a scrupulous and 
  careful check on the changes which are taking place if they are correctly to 
  orientate the advance guard and give guidance to the masses.</p>


<p>In criticising the barren conceptions of Stalinism, which identified all regimes 
  to fascism at the time of the 'third period', Trotsky brilliantly characterised 
  the essence of the epoch as one of <em>change and fluctuations, </em>in which 
  generalisations would not suffice. Each stage must be <em>examined concretely 
  </em>by the vanguard who could thus understand and interpret events and draw 
  the correct practical conclusions for activity therefrom. He wrote:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The vast importance of a correct theoretical orientation is most strikingly 
  manifested in a period of acute social conflict, of rapid political shifts, 
  of abrupt changes in the situation. In such periods, political <em>conceptions 
  and generalisations </em>are rapidly used up and require either a complete replacement 
  (which is easier) or their concretisation, precision and partial rectification 
  (which is harder.) It is in just such periods that all sorts of <em>transitional, 
  </em>intermediate situations and combinations arise, as a matter of necessity, 
  which upset the customary patterns and doubly require a sustained theoretical 
  attention. In a word, if in the pacific and 'organic' period (before the war) 
  one could still live on the revenue from a few ready-made abstractions, in our 
  time each new event forcefully brings home the most important law of the dialectic: 
  <em>the truth is always concrete</em>.&quot; (<em>Bonapartism and Fascism, </em>July 
  1934) <sup><a href="../../../trotsky/germany/1934/340715.htm">[source]</a></sup></p>


<p class="fst">Among the cadres of the Fourth International, there are comrades who have not 
  sufficiently understood this lesson. They continue to live on the 'revenue from 
  a few ready-made abstractions' instead of concretising or partially rectifying 
  previous generalisations. An outstanding example of this is the article of Pierre 
  Frank.</p>


<p>Frank attempts to equate all regimes in Western Europe to 'Bonapartism'. His 
  generalisations go even further: he argues that there have been Bonapartist 
  regimes in France since 1934; that it is impossible to have any but Bonapartist 
  or fascist regimes until the coming to power of the proletariat in Europe. This, 
  if you please, in the name of 'the continuity of our political analysis for 
  more than ten years of French history'! Such complacency reduces theory to formless 
  abstractions and conceals inevitable and episodic errors, thus making them into 
  a system. It has no place in the Fourth International.</p>


<p>Comrade Frank indiscriminately mixes the terms bourgeois democracy with Bonapartism, 
  not explaining the specific traits of either. He interchangeably speaks of 'Bonapartism', 
  'elements of Bonapartism' and he contrasts democratic liberties with 'a regime 
  which one can correctly define as democratic.' Yet the reader has to seek in 
  vain for a definition of his ideal 'democratic regime' as distinguished from 
  the very real bourgeois democracy. He denies the existence of democratic regimes 
  in Europe today because 'there is literally no place for them.'</p>


<h4>Economic Basis and Political Superstructure</h4>

<p>We will here repeat some elementary ideas of Marxism in order to arrive at 
  the necessary clarity and understanding of the shifting processes and changes 
  taking place in the regimes in Europe at the present time - at least in Western 
  Europe. The Eastern half, dominated directly by the Stalinist bureaucracy, develops 
  in a different direction and under different conditions.</p>


<p>The <em>political character of a regime</em> (Bonapartist, fascist, democratic) 
  is basically determined by the relations between the classes in the nation, 
  which vary at different stages. Its fundamental nature is determined, in the 
  last analysis, by its <em>mode of production and property relations, </em>by its 
  <em>class character. </em>Thus the regimes of Hitler<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup> and 
  Roosevelt, of Attlee and Mussolini, of Franco and Gouin, of Peron and Salazar, 
  of de Valera and Chiang Kai Shek are all governments of the capitalist class, 
  for they rest upon the economy of capitalist exploitation. However, the <em>class 
  nature </em>of these regimes does not exhaust the problem. We have to classify 
  the instrument - which differs in each case - by which the bourgeoisie ensures 
  its dominance and rule. The character of this rule is decided not only by the 
  <em>subjective </em>wishes and needs of the finance-capitalists, which remain 
  but one factor in the process, but precisely by the objective-subjective inter-relations 
  between the classes at a given stage, which has been predicated by the previous 
  history and the development of the class struggle of the given country.</p>


<p>It is a vulgarisation of Marxism - vulgar materialism of the worst sort - to 
  argue that the superstructure of a society is determined immediately by the 
  development of its economy.</p>


<p>The disappearance of the economic basis on which the 'democracy' of the imperialists 
  is based, does not immediately lead to the disappearance of the bourgeois democracy. 
  It only prepares its collapse <em>in the long run</em>. Properly speaking, the 
  development of capitalism into imperialism by the beginning of this century 
  had already rendered outmoded the existence of bourgeois democracy. Yet we see 
  that bourgeois democracy managed to maintain itself for decades after its economic 
  base had disappeared.</p>


<p>That capitalism had outlived its historic functions was attested already by 
  the first imperialist world war. But this did not, and could not by itself, 
  lead to the overthrow of the capitalist system. The first world war led to favourable 
  conditions for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie on a world scale. But the proletariat 
  was prevented from carrying out its mission by the organisations of its own 
  creation. The social democracy betrayed the revolution and saved the capitalist 
  system from destruction. In the revolutionary epoch following world war one, 
  the bourgeoisie was compelled to lean on the social democracy for support, the 
  only reliable prop they had to maintain their rule. Where the bourgeoisie relied 
  on such regimes based on social democracy, uniting repression against the revolutionary 
  workers with reforms and half-reforms, these could only be characterised as 
  regimes of 'bourgeois democracy.' Thus, Lenin and Trotsky characterised the 
  counter-revolutionary regime in Germany in 1918, which was organised by social 
  democracy, as a bourgeois democratic regime.</p>


<p>It is ABC that the democratic liberties were gained in the struggle against 
  the bourgeoisie over a period of a century; the right to vote had to be fought 
  for and wrested from the bourgeoisie at a period of<em> ascending capitalism, 
  </em>at the time of the blossoming of bourgeois democracy. Even in its heyday 
  there was never an idyllic democratic state without police intervention and 
  without brute force.</p>


<p>Yet even at this stage when capitalism was still an ascending economy, there 
  were not only democratic regimes but Bonapartist regimes as well. In the classic 
  land of Bonapartism, both Louis Napoleon<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup>, and Bonaparte 
  himself came to power at a time when there was a veritable boom which lasted 
  in the one case for two decades. According to Comrade Frank's conception there 
  was no basis for Bonapartism; there should have only been bourgeois democracy. 
  But we see the problem is not so simple.</p>


<p>And after Louis Napoleon, bourgeois democracy (with one or two threats of dictatorship 
  - Boulangerism) lasted for decades in France. According to Frank's mysterious 
  conceptions, after Bonapartism - which means that the economic basis for democracy 
  is gone - It is no longer possible for the bourgeoisie to have democracy, but...only 
  Bonapartism.</p>


<p>It is difficult to understand why Comrade Frank stops at 1934 to trace Bonapartist 
  regimes in France. If we follow his method logically we have had Bonapartism 
  since the coup d'etat of Louis Napoleon in 1851, or perhaps since the first 
  Bonaparte!</p>


<p>If there is a grain of sense in his case that the economic basis for reforms 
  has disappeared, all that it proves is not automatically and consequently a 
  regime of Bonapartism is posed but that the democratic regime under such conditions 
  will be of an extremely unstable character, afflicted with convulsions and crises, 
  which must make way either for the revolutionary proletarian dictatorship or 
  the open dictatorship of finance capital through Bonapartism or fascism.</p>


<p>Comrade Frank says the existence of democratic liberties does not suffice to 
  make a democratic regime. A profound observation! What follows? The existence 
  of Bonapartist measures does not make a regime Bonapartist either, Comrade Frank! 
  This argument is about as profound as those of the 'bureaucratic collectivises' 
  who argued that we had the intervention of the state in the economy in Germany 
  under Hitler, in France under Blum, in America under Roosevelt (National Industrial 
  Recovery Act), in Russia under Stalin...consequently all those regimes were 
  the same. It is not the points of similarity only - all human societies have 
  points of similarity, particularly different types of capitalist societies - 
  it is the<em> decisive traits </em>which determine our definition of regimes.</p>


<h4>Counter-Revolution in a Democratic Form</h4>

<p>The British RCP has characterised the regimes in Western Europe (France, Belgium, 
  Holland, Italy) as regimes of counter-revolution in a democratic form. Comrade 
  Pierre Frank claims that the idea of 'democratic counter-revolution' is 'devoid 
  of all content.' He would then he hard put to explain what the Weimar<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-3" name="doc-3">(3)</a></sup> 
  Republic organised by the social democracy in Germany was. He would be compelled 
  to argue that what took place in Germany in 1918, was <em>not</em> the proletarian 
  revolution which was betrayed by the 'counter-revolution in a democratic form' 
  (by the undemocratic and bloody suppression of the January 1919 uprisings), 
  but was a democratic revolution which overthrew the Kaiser and replaced his 
  regime by one of 'pure' bourgeois democracy! The fact that this regime was ushered 
  in by martial law and the conspiracy of the social democratic leaders with the 
  General Staff of the Reichswehr, the Junkers and the bourgeoisie, validates 
  entirely the conclusion of Lenin and Trotsky that there was a 'democratic' counter-revolution, 
  with the bourgeoisie using the social democrats as their agents.</p>


<p>In advance Trotsky foresaw and prepared theoretically for a similar situation 
  with the collapse of fascism in Italy, when he wrote in a letter to the Italian 
  comrades in 1930:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Following the above comes the question of the 'transitional' period in 
  Italy. At the very outset it is necessary to establish very clearly: transition 
  from what to what? A period of transition from the bourgeois (or 'popular') 
  revolution to the proletarian revolution is one thing. A period of transition 
  from the fascist dictatorship to the proletarian dictatorship is another. If 
  the first conception is envisaged, the question of the bourgeois revolution 
  is posed in the first place and it is then a question of establishing the role 
  of the proletariat in it. Only after that will the question of the transitional 
  period toward a proletarian revolution be posed. If the second conception is 
  envisaged, the question is then posed of a series of battles, disturbances, 
  upsets in the situation, abrupt turns, constituting in their ensemble the different 
  stages of the proletarian revolution. These stages may be many in number. But 
  in no case can they contain within them a bourgeois revolution or its mysterious 
  hybrid: the 'popular' revolution.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Does this mean that Italy cannot for a certain time again become a parliamentary 
  state or become a 'democratic republic'? I consider - in perfect agreement with 
  you, I think - that this eventuality is not excluded. But then it will not be 
  the fruit of a bourgeois revolution but the abortion of an insufficiently matured 
  and premature proletarian revolution. In case of a profound revolutionary crisis 
  and of mass battles in the course of which the proletarian vanguard will not 
  have been in a position to take power, it may be that the bourgeoisie will reconstruct 
  its power on 'democratic' bases.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Can it be said, for example, that the present German republic constitutes 
  a conquest of the bourgeois revolution? Such an assertion would be absurd. There 
  was in Germany in 1918-19 a proletarian revolution which, deprived of leadership, 
  was deceived, betrayed and crushed. But the bourgeois counter-revolution nevertheless 
  found itself obliged to adapt itself to the circumstances resulting from this 
  crushing of the proletarian revolution and to assume the form of a republic 
  in the 'democratic' parliamentary form. Is the same - or about the same - eventuality 
  excluded from Italy? No, it is not excluded. The enthronement of fascism was 
  the result of the incompletion of the proletarian revolution in 1920. Only a 
  new proletarian revolution can overturn fascism. If it should not be destined 
  to triumph this time either (weakness of the Communist Party, manoeuvres and 
  betrayals of the social democrats, the freemasons, the catholics), the 'transitional' 
  state that the bourgeois counter-revolution would then be forced to set up in 
  the ruins of its power in a fascist form, could be nothing else than a parliamentary 
  and democratic state.&quot; (<em>Problems of the Italian Revolution, </em>14 May, 
  1930)  <sup><a href="http://www.marxist.com/problems-italian-revolution-trotsky1930.htm">[source]</a></sup></p>


<p class="fst">Events in Italy have demonstrated the remarkable foresight of Trotsky. The 
  bourgeoisie has been compelled to allow the jettisoning of the king<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-4" name="doc-4">(4)</a></sup> and the Stalinist-socialist traitors have headed off the 
  developing proletarian revolution into the channels of a 'parliamentary and 
  democratic state'. This of course, will not attain a stable base, but will be 
  subject to crises and upheavals, movements on the part of the proletariat, and 
  counter-movements of monarchists and fascists. Would Frank now deny the correctness 
  of Trotsky's conceptions and assert that we have had a Bonapartist state since 
  the fall of Mussolini?</p>


<p>It is incomprehensible that Frank, in his argumentation, should refer to this 
  very article of Trotsky's which puts forward precisely the opposite point of 
  view. After fascism what? asks the Old Man and answers that, as a means of preventing 
  the revolution in face of mass upsurge, the bourgeoisie will turn towards the 
  establishment of a bourgeois democratic republic. We note in this connection 
  that the immediate introduction of Bonapartism (allegedly because democracy 
  has no economic base) was not even considered by Trotsky.</p>


<p>From this can be seen that what is really 'devoid of content' is the mechanical 
  conception that counter-revolution can only manifest itself in the form of fascism 
  or Bonapartism, ie military-police dictatorships.</p>


<p>'The experience of history has shown, and events now unfolding in Europe demonstrate 
  irrefutably, that the methods of the bourgeoisie in its struggle against the 
  proletarian revolution vary widely and are not determined <em>a priori. </em>The 
  bourgeoisie makes use of different methods, relies on different strata, depending 
  on the class relation of forces in order to re-enforce or re-establish its rule.</p>


<p>Whether they can manoeuvre the Stalinists or manipulate their social democratic, 
  Bonapartist, or fascist agencies, or as sometimes happens, <em>use all forces 
  simultaneously, </em>does not depend only on the subjective intentions of the 
  ruling class, or on this or that adventurer, but on the objective conditions 
  and the inter-relations between all the classes in the nation - bourgeoisie, 
  petty bourgeoisie and proletariat, at any given time. To repeat mechanically 
  the conclusion that the existence of finance capital is incompatible with bourgeois 
  democracy in the contemporary period (which is indubitably correct within certain 
  limits), and thus that all regimes must be Bonapartist, is to substitute abstract 
  categories formulated on the basis of partial and insufficient historical experience, 
  or a narrow and incomplete view of the process as a whole, for a dialectical 
  analysis of events.</p>


<p>To understand the nature of the regimes in Western Europe today, we must know 
  the background on which they evolved. The revolutionary movement of the masses 
  following World War One was paralysed and betrayed by the social democrats, 
  <em>who alone were able to save capitalism from destruction under the banner
 of bourgeois democracy. </em>The bourgeoisie was compelled to rely on its 
  social democratic agencies for mere survival.</p>


<p>The failure of the proletariat to take power could lead only to the further 
  degeneration and decay of capitalism. The ruin of the petty bourgeoisie, which 
  was shown no way out by the mass organisations of the proletariat, led to them 
  becoming a tool of fascist reaction. Trapped by the intolerable crisis of their 
  system in one country after another, through many transitions, the bourgeoisie 
  turned in the direction of open and unbridled dictatorship.</p>


<p>The wave of revolution was followed by a wave of counter-revolution. In Italy, 
  Germany and other countries, the bourgeoisie used the forces of the frenzied 
  petty bourgeoisie to destroy the organisations of the proletariat. They were 
  compelled at a later stage to turn on the petty bourgeoisie and transform themselves 
  into Bonapartist regimes, ie <em>regimes resting directly on the support of the 
  military-police apparatus rather than regimes with a mass basis.</em></p>


<p>This could not solve the contradictions of the capitalist system on a national 
  or international scale but inevitably led to the second world war, in a frantic 
  endeavour by the bourgeoisie to find a way out by a repartition of the world. 
  But the second world war, even more than the first, put at stake the whole existence 
  of capitalism as a system. The bourgeoisie realised, with dread, that the unleashing 
  of the war would release tremendous revolutionary energy from the depths of 
  the masses and recreate the conditions favourable to the overthrow of capitalism 
  on a continental scale.</p>


<p>The victories of the nazis and the conquest of practically the whole of the 
  continent of Europe had, as a by-product, the effect of temporally destroying 
  the mass basis of reaction throughout Europe. Reaction and the capitalist system 
  rested directly on the bayonets of the nazi fascist armies. The hated Quislings 
  played a purely auxiliary role. With the victories of the Red Army and the collapse 
  of Hitler and Mussolini, the problem of the socialist revolution was posed on 
  the order of the day throughout Europe. Reaction was without a strong base in 
  the populations <em>and without a strong stable military-police apparatus. </em>The 
  allied armies could not be a stable prop for reaction and open military dictatorship 
  for long. In most of the European countries the bourgeoisie was faced with mass 
  upsurge, <em>which they could not bridle with their own forces.</em></p>


<p>Greece was the exception. Only after a civil war and a bloody war of intervention 
  was it possible to install a semi-Bonapartist or Bonapartist regime, which is 
  step-by-step attempting to impose a totalitarian regime in that country. The 
  imperialists are aware of the impossibility of using such methods on a continental 
  scale. In addition, in Greece the power of reaction had to be maintained at 
  all costs for fear that this last outpost of British imperialism in the Balkan 
  peninsula should, in common with the rest of the Balkans, fall under the sway 
  of the Stalinist bureaucracy. But even here it was not possible to destroy completely 
  the mass organisations of the proletariat.</p>


<p>Nothing saved the capitalist system in Western Europe except the betrayal of 
  social democracy and Stalinism. When the bourgeoisie leans on its social democratic 
  and Stalinist agencies <em>for the purpose of counter-revolution</em>, what is 
  the 'content' of that counter-revolution? Bonapartist, fascist, authoritarian? 
  Of course not! Its content is that of a 'counter revolution in a democratic 
  form.'</p>


<p>Of course, the bourgeoisie cannot stabilise itself for any length of time on 
  the basis of the democratic counter-revolution. Where the revolution is stemmed 
  by the lackeys of the bourgeoisie, the class forces do not stay suspended. After 
  a period, which can be more or less protracted according to the economic and 
  political developments internationally and within the given country, the bourgeoisie 
  shifts to Bonapartist or fascist counter-revolution.</p>


<p>That is how events manifested themselves in Italy within two years of the ebbing 
  of the revolutionary tide provoked by world war one, and in Germany over a period 
  of 15 years. The change in class relationships reflected itself in the change 
  in regimes through democracy, preventative Bonapartism, to fascism, pure Bonapartist 
  military dictatorship.</p>


<p>Despite the further degeneration of its economic and political base, the failure 
  of the workers once again to take power, destroy capitalist relations and organise 
  society anew, has resulted in the establishment of bourgeois democratic governments 
  in Italy, France and other countries, based upon the manipulation of the Stalinists 
  and social democrats. To argue that counter- revolution or the rule of the bourgeoisie 
  in the present period can only manifest itself in Bonapartism, fascism or Franco-type 
  governments, is to abandon the Marxist appreciation of the processes in modern 
  society. Taking into account the many factors involved in the history of the 
  period, including the weakness of the Marxist current, it could have been, and 
  was, predicted in advance what the developments in Western Europe would be. 
  But the process can only be understood if one takes into account the real nature 
  of democracy, Bonapartism, fascism, and not merely their outward forms.</p>


<h4>Differing Regimes in Capitalist Society</h4>

<p>The classic Bonapartism of the first Napoleon rose out of the bourgeois democratic 
  revolution in the period of the youth and vigour of capitalism. Bonapartism, 
  <em>the rule of the sword over society, </em>represented a position where the 
  state assumed a relative independence of the classes, balancing between the 
  hostile classes and arbitrating between them. It remained, nevertheless, an 
  instrument above all, of the big capitalists. Napoleon, by leaning on the support 
  of the peasants, could maintain himself for a whole historical period because 
  of the development of the productive forces in France at this period.</p>


<p>So with Napoleon the Little, who established his power in France in the coup 
  d'etat of 1851. Marx, in the <em>Eighteenth Brumaire, </em>described the position 
  thus: &quot;the State has gone back to its earliest form, in which the sword rules 
  without shame and club law prevails. [Hardly a mirror of the regime of de Gaulle 
  in France after the liberation! - EG]. Thus is the <em>coup-de-main </em>of February 
  1848 answered by the <em>coup-de-tete </em>of December 1851.&quot;
<sup><a href="../../../marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm">[source (translation differs)]</a></sup>
</p>


<p>That is the essence of Bonapartism: naked, military-police dictatorship, the 
  'arbiter' with a sword. A regime which indicates that the antagonisms within 
  society have become so great that the state machine, 'regulating' and 'ordering' 
  these antagonisms, while remaining an instrument of the property owners, assumes 
  a certain independence of all the classes. A 'national judge' concentrating 
  power in his hands, personally 'arbitrates' the conflicts within the nation, 
  playing off one class against another, nevertheless remaining a tool of the 
  property owners. At the same time, we characterise as Bonapartist, a regime 
  where the basic class forces of bourgeoisie and proletariat more or less balance 
  one another, thus allowing the state power to manoeuvre and balance the contending 
  camps and again giving the state power a certain independence in relation to 
  society as a whole.</p>


<p>However, there is a big difference between the role of Bonapartism in the period 
  of capitalism's ascending phase and the period of its decline. We give two quotations 
  from Trotsky explaining this difference with the utmost clarity, in <em>Germany, 
  The Only Road.</em></p>


<p class="quote">&quot;In its time, we designated the Bruening<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-5" name="doc-5">(5)</a></sup> government as <em>Bonapartism </em>('caricature of Bonapartism'), 
  that is, as a regime of the military police dictatorship. As soon as the struggle 
  of two social strata - the haves and the have-nots, the exploiter and the exploited 
  - reaches its highest tension, the conditions are given for the domination of 
  bureaucracy, police, soldiery. The government becomes 'independent' of society. 
  Let us once more recall: if two forks are stuck symmetrically into a cork, the 
  latter can stand even on the head of a pin. That is precisely the scheme of 
  Bonapartism. To be sure, such a government does not cease being the clerk of 
  the property-owners. Yet the clerk sits on the back of the boss, rubs his neck 
  raw and does not hesitate at times to dig his boots into his face.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;It might have been assumed that Bruening would hold on until the final 
  solution. Yet, in the course of events, another link inserted itself: the Papen 
  government. Were we to be exact, we should have to make a rectification of our 
  old designation: the Bruening government was a pre-Bonapartist government. Bruening 
  was only a precursor. In a perfected form, Bonapartism came upon the scene in 
  the Papen-Schleicher government (September 1932).&quot;
<sup><a href="../../../trotsky/germany/1932/320914.htm">[source]</a></sup>
</p>


<p class="fst">And further on:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;However, in spite of the appearance of concentrated forces, the Papen 
  government <em>as such </em>is weaker yet than its predecessor. The Bonapartist 
  regime can attain a comparatively stable and durable character only in the event 
  that it brings a revolutionary epoch to a close; when the relationship of forces 
  has already been tested in battles; when the revolutionary classes are already 
  spent; while the possessing classes have not yet freed themselves from the fear; 
  will not the morrow bring new convulsions? Without this basic condition, that 
  is, without a preceding exhaustion of the mass energies in battles, a Bonapartist 
  regime is in no position to develop.&quot;
<sup><a href="../../../trotsky/germany/1932/320914.htm">[source]</a></sup>
</p>


<p class="fst">The Bonapartism at the stage of capitalism's rise, raising itself above society, 
  suppressing and 'arbitrating' the open conflicts within it and regulating the 
  class antagonisms, is strong and confident. Under the conditions of a powerful 
  development of the productive forces, it attains a certain stability. But the 
  Bonapartism of capitalism's decline is affected by senility. Rising out of the 
  crisis of capitalist society, it cannot solve any of the problems with which 
  it is faced. The main crisis of society, the conflict between the productive 
  forces and private ownership and the national state, has become so great, the 
  class antagonisms which it engenders, so tense, that this which alone allows 
  the rise of senile Bonapartism, at the same time, as a consequence, makes it 
  so weak and feeble that its whole structure is shaky and likely to be overthrown 
  in the series of crises which confront it. It is this weakness of Bonapartism 
  which leads to the bourgeoisie and military clique surrendering the power to 
  fascism and unleashing the greedy bands of maddened petty bourgeoisie and lumpenproletariat 
  against the proletariat and its class organisations.</p>


<p>The differing categories of regimes, though of vital importance for Marxist 
  theory and practice, are not metaphysical abstractions, indicating a rigid, 
  fixed and eternal differentiation between them.</p>


<p>There are so many factors involved, that it is necessary to examine each regime 
  concretely before categorically defining its position.</p>


<p>It is only necessary to point out that even within each rough category, widely 
  differing regimes can be comprised. England with her feudal remnants (House 
  of Lords and monarchy) and barbarous oppression of colonial peoples, is a 'democracy'. 
  The Federal Republic of Switzerland, and France with its laws based on the <em>Code 
  Napoleon, </em>the United States, Weimar Germany and Eire - despite their wide 
  differences, remain 'democracies'. What, then, is the dominating thread which 
  places these regimes under one head?</p>


<p>Despite their diverse histories, which explains their different national peculiarities, 
  <em>they all possess certain specific traits in common</em>. These are the traits 
  which are decisive in determining the Marxist classification. All have independent 
  workers' organisations: trade unions, parties, clubs, etc, with the rights which 
  go with them. The right to strike, organise, the right to vote, free speech, 
  press, etc, and the other rights which have been the by-product of the class 
  struggle of the proletariat in the past. (Here we might add that the loss of 
  this or that right would not, in itself, he decisive in our analysis of a regime. 
  It is the totality of the relations which is the determining factor.) In one 
  sense, the existence, <em>within capitalism, </em>of elements of the new society. 
  Or, as explained by Trotsky in <em>Germany, What Next </em>
<sup><a href="../../../trotsky/germany/1932-ger/index.htm">[source]</a></sup> in answering the Stalinist
  ultra-lefts, <em>under the regime of the bourgeoisie there already exists the 
  embryo of the rule of the working class in the form of the workers' organisations.</em></p>


<p>Where these organisations exist and play a powerful role (in France and Italy 
  they are stronger than they have ever been) the bourgeoisie rules through the 
  leaders and top layers of these organisations. It is not without interest, as 
  Lenin pointed out, that at a certain stage, the bourgeoisie even ruled through 
  the Soviets, or more correctly, the Menshevik leadership of the Soviets.</p>


<p>Fascism too, has its peculiarities. The regimes of Franco, Mussolini, Hitler 
  and Pilsudsky<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-6" name="doc-6">(6)</a></sup>, all are comprised within this conception. 
  Yet there are wide differences between them. What fundamentally unites the conception 
  is the <em>complete destruction of all working-class organisations. </em>Yet even 
  here we see that right up to the outbreak of the war, Polish fascism, far weaker 
  than that of Germany and Italy, had not completely succeeded in destroying the 
  workers' organisations and may have been overthrown before it finally succeeded 
  in doing so.</p>


<p>Bonapartism too, shows a similar variety. Napoleon, Louis Napoleon, von Schleicher 
  and Papen, Petain, and the fascist-regimes-become-Bonapartist - all were Bonapartist 
  regimes. What is it that they have in common? The independence of the state, 
  the concentration of power 'personally', resting directly and openly on the 
  domination of the state machine through <em>the naked power of the military-police 
  apparatus,</em> '<em>Rule by the sword</em>.' Whatever differences there 
  may be between the regimes, the existence of workers' organisations with attenuated 
  or limited rights in certain cases, they all have the above mentioned features 
  in common. The specific peculiarities in each case would again be determined 
  by the history of the country, the development of the social contradictions 
  which made the development of Bonapartism possible, etc, etc.</p>


<p>Thus the weak and sterile Bonapartism of Petain and von Schleicher in the epoch 
  of capitalist decline resembled only as a caricature the vigorous and powerful 
  regime established by Napoleon in its period of ascent. In the change from democracy 
  to fascism, there must be one, perhaps many, transitional phases. Thus the path 
  for Bonapartism is prepared by the division of the nation into two hostile camps 
  - that of the fascist petit bourgeoisie and that of the organised working class. 
  Nominally, the state power assumes an independence of both and the military-police 
  regime established prepares the way for the handing of power to fascism. (The 
  bourgeoisie prefers to rule through democratic means. Under the impact of crisis, 
  however, they utilise the fascist gangs as a terrorist agency for pressure on 
  the proletariat so that they can push through Bonapartist dictatorial measures. 
  Only as a last resort do they reluctantly surrender power to the fascists.) 
  At least that was the process in Italy and Germany. Depending on many factors, 
  including the policy of the revolutionary party of the proletariat, events in 
  Europe and elsewhere may develop on somewhat different lines, should reaction 
  succeed in temporarily stabilising itself.</p>


<p>However, it is important to note that the regimes of Schleicher and Papen, 
  of Petain and General Sirovy in Czechoslovakia after Munich <em>all developed 
  directly </em>(through intermediate stages perhaps) <em>out of the regimes of 
  bourgeois democracy. </em>The pre-Bonapartist, or even Bonapartist regimes, of 
  Doumergue<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-7" name="doc-7">(7)</a></sup>, Laval and Flandin prepared the way for the 
  Popular Front in France which in turn paved the way again for a development 
  towards Bonapartism. To call the Popular Front under Blum 'Bonapartism' as does 
  Comrade Frank in the citation which follows, can only cause immeasurable confusion 
  in the ranks of the Fourth International:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;...But the Bonapartism of declining capitalism can cloak itself in other 
  costumes. In certain cases it is fairly difficult to recognise it, for example 
  in the case of governments, of the left, even very much to the left, notably 
  of the Popular Front type. There, Bonapartism is so outrageously varnished with 
  a democratic sheen that many allow themselves to be taken in by it (!)&quot;</p>


<p class="fst">In those words of Comrade Frank is the key to the confusion in the characterisation 
  of regimes. It is easy to slip into such errors because in the same way as the 
  embryo of a new form of society exists in the workers' organisations, so the 
  possibility of Bonapartism is rooted in the structure of society under bourgeois 
  democracy. Within every state there is reflected the antagonisms within society, 
  even in the freest bourgeois democratic society. As Engels wrote in his book 
  <em>The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State</em>:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The state is therefore by no means a power imposed on society from the 
  outside; just as little is it the reality of the moral idea, the image and reality 
  of reason, as Hegel asserted. Rather it is a product of society at a certain 
  stage of development; it is the admission that this society has become entangled 
  in an insoluble contradiction within itself, that it is cleft into irreconcilable 
  antagonisms which it is powerless to dispel. But in order that these antagonisms, 
  classes with conflicting economic interests, may not consume themselves and 
  society in sterile struggle, a power apparently standing above society becomes 
  necessary, whose purpose is to moderate the conflict and keep it within the 
  bounds of 'order'; and this power arising out of society, but placing itself 
  above it and increasingly separating itself from it, is the state.&quot; (Peking,
  1978, page 205)
<sup><a href="../../../marx/works/1884/origin-family/ch09.htm">[source (translation differs)]</a></sup>
</p>


<p class="fst">In the last analysis every state is based on naked force. The army officers, 
  the general staff clique, the police and civil service bureaucracy, trained 
  and selected to serve the interests of capitalism, provide the soil on which 
  military plots and conspiracies thrive, given conditions of crisis and social 
  ferment.</p>


<p>Pierre Frank confuses here the role of the state with Bonapartism. A democracy 
  that was not based on force, that did not have an apparatus placing itself above 
  society, has never existed and never will exist. But this does not make Bonapartism.</p>


<p>But because every state is based on armed bodies of men with its appendages 
  in the form of prisons, courts, etc, and thus even under the fullest democratic 
  regime we have the hidden dictatorship of capitalism, it does not follow that 
  every repressive regime is necessarily Bonapartist. Repression and suppression 
  of the rights of the workers under conditions of 'emergency' take place under 
  every regime, including the democratic, when the basic interests of capital 
  are threatened and till 'normal' conditions are restored - ie, till the masses 
  accept without active rebellion, the yoke of capital. The bourgeoisie preserves 
  an extreme flexibility, manipulating the regimes according to the resistance 
  of the masses, the class forces, etc. Thanks to the betrayals of the workers' 
  leaderships they are enabled to do this.</p>


<h4>Prognosis in the Light of Events</h4>

<p>Whatever their original desires or wishes to impose Bonapartist regimes in 
  Europe, Anglo-American imperialism soon saw the impossibility of this (apart 
  from Greece) in the incalculable dangers which it would bring and in Western 
  Europe swung over to democratic regimes, based on a disarmed proletariat.</p>


<p>Events in France and Western Europe have confirmed the incorrectness of the 
  method of Pierre Frank. Everywhere in Western Europe since the 'liberation', 
  the tendency has been for a steady movement towards bourgeois democracy and 
  not towards greater and greater dictatorial regimes; towards an increase in 
  democratic rights, not towards their limitation. <em>At a later stage 
  this tendency will be reversed, </em>but at present the motion in Western Europe 
  is towards bourgeois democratic regimes. Thus in Italy we have the establishment 
  of the bourgeois democratic republic, trade unions, etc; in France we have elections, 
  parties, trade unions, etc; in Belgium and Holland we have democratic elections. 
  The swing of the masses towards socialism-communism is reflected in the fact 
  that these parties have secured a greater percentage of the votes than at any 
  time in history. In order to mobilise the petty bourgeois reaction as a counterpoise 
  against them, the bourgeoisie, <em>at this stage, </em>is leaning not on fascist 
  reaction (that is still well in reserve) <em>but on the catholic and christian 
  parties basing themselves on parliamentary democracy. </em>This gives the bourgeoisie 
  a breathing space to prepare at a later stage and under the necessary favourable 
  conditions for a transition through Bonapartist regimes to totalitarian dictatorship.</p>


<p>It is clear that the position today is entirely different from the position 
  in Germany and Italy before the victory of fascism, where mass parties of fascism 
  were organised and the possibility of the state manoeuvring between the two 
  mortally hostile camps, was posed by the whole situation. Far from this, in 
  Italy and France the Christian Democratic parties are collaborating with the 
  workers' organisations in a typical coalition cabinet of bourgeois democracy. 
  The bourgeoisie cannot do otherwise because of the danger of revolutionary disturbances 
  on the part of the masses.</p>


<p>The situation is similar to that in Germany in the Weimar Republic. In order 
  to stem the revolution the bourgeoisie organised a coalition government of social 
  democracy and the Catholic Centre<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-8" name="doc-8">(8)</a></sup>.</p>


<p>Was this Bonapartism? Obviously not. But as a result of the policy of social 
  democracy they were punished by the petty bourgeois swinging to reaction and 
  a Bonapartist-monarchist attempt at a coup d'etat in the Kapp Putsch<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-9" name="doc-9">(9)</a></sup> 
  in 1920. As is well known, this attempted Bonapartist coup was defeated by the 
  masses, where the communists and socialists participated in a general strike. 
  The indignation of the workers, <em>owing to the correct propaganda of the Communist 
  Party </em>in warning of this danger and forming a united front to beat it 
  off, led to the workers in the Ruhr attempting the seizure of power. The reaction 
  then joined together with the social democrats to crush this movement of the 
  masses. This in its turn, paved the way for an uneasy and unstable regime of 
  bourgeois democracy.</p>


<p>The false position on the nature of the regimes in Europe flows from an incorrect 
  perspective. The American comrades argued that only Franco-type military dictatorships 
  were possible in Europe after the victory of the allied imperialists. Pierre 
  Frank approvingly quotes a wrong position taken by the International Secretariat 
  (IS) in 1940:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;If England should install de Gaulle in France tomorrow, his regime would 
  not in the least be distinguished from that of the Bonapartist government of 
  Petain.&quot;
<sup><a href="../../../../history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/ww/1940-ww02.htm">[source]</a></sup>
</p>


<p class="fst">A trifle different, Comrade Frank! For the workers a decisive difference! It 
  is true that the capitalist class continued to rule under de Gaulle as they 
  did under Petain. But to argue in 1946 that the regimes could not be distinguished 
  is to fall into the sectarian stupidity of the Stalinists in Germany who couldn't 
  distinguish between a capitalist regime leaning on the workers' organisations 
  and the abolition of these organisations by fascism.</p>


<p>Pierre Frank's confusion is further exposed by his triumphant declaration that 
  the Petain regime was Bonapartist. Trotsky said that the Petain regime was Bonapartist. 
  But Frank just does not understand what Trotsky was driving at. In their period 
  of decay and decline, Trotsky referred to the regimes of Hitler and Mussolini 
  as Bonapartist regimes. The only difference between these regimes and that of 
  Petain was that <em>Petain never had a mass base in the petty bourgeoisie, </em>like 
  Hitler and Mussolini, and in that sense could not be called fascist, but Bonapartist. 
  For this reason his regime was much weaker and could be more easily over-thrown 
  by a movement of the masses. Petain had to lean on foreign bayonets for his 
  rule. Otherwise there is no difference between the regimes of Franco, Mussolini 
  and Hitler in their decaying phases and that of Petain.</p>


<p>Comrade Frank declares:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;...our most responsible International body has predicted that a simple 
  substitution of gangs following a victory of the Allies would not signify a 
  change in the nature of the political regime. We find ourselves in the presence 
  of an evaluation on the historical scale based on positions which were defended 
  for many years by the Fourth International against all other theories and cheap 
  labels spread by the other tendencies and formations of the labour movement. 
  If an error was committed it would be truly a considerable one and we would 
  be urgently obliged to seek the reasons for it and correct it. As for ourselves, 
  we don't believe that our organisation was in error on this point...&quot;</p>


<p class="fst">The statement of the IS made in 1940 was incorrect. We made the same mistake. 
  Under the circumstances it was excusable. But to repeat in 1946 a mistake that 
  was already clear by 1943 is inexcusable. A British Trotskyist resolution, written 
  in 1943, in which we corrected ourselves, analysed the coming situation in Europe 
  as follows:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;In the absence of experienced Trotskyist parties with roots and traditions 
  among the masses, the first stages of the revolutionary struggles in Europe 
  will most likely result in a period of Kerenskyism or Popular Frontism. This 
  is already presaged by the initial struggles of the Italian workers and the 
  repeated betrayals of social democracy and Stalinism.&quot; (Main resolution 
  at the National Conference of the Workers International League, October 1943).</p>


<p class="fst">Events have demonstrated the correctness of this analysis. Instead of frankly 
  facing up to an error in perspective, Frank flies in the face of reality and 
  attempts to convert an error into a virtue.</p>


<p>Frank takes France as the keystone of his thesis. He surely must be lamenting 
  this by now. Because it is France, above all, which has mirrored the process 
  very clearly. France is the key to Europe and any mistakes on the nature of 
  the French regime could be fatal for the young cadres of Trotskyism.</p>


<p>Let us examine the situation. Pierre Frank visualises the development as follows: 
  Bonapartism since 1934, because, you see, the bourgeoisie could not afford bourgeois 
  democracy; Petain was Bonaparte: de Gaulle was Bonaparte; the Popular Front 
  (Blum!) was Bonapartism; in fact, as the metaphysicians would say: 'in the twilight 
  all cats are grey'. The thesis is that all were Bonaparte. It follows that Gouin 
  is Bonaparte and the government which will follow also will be Bonapartist. 
  If this madness should infect the French, our French Party will be in a sorry 
  state. Happily, this danger apparently does not exist.</p>


<p>A Marxist appreciation would be somewhat different from that of Pierre Frank. 
  What was the development of the regime - from what to what is it evolving? What 
  is the position of the classes? What are the relations between the classes? 
  A sober appreciation of the last two years will tell us that (a) here we have 
  an unachieved proletarian revolution; result (b) unstable bourgeois democracy, 
  assembly, elections, constituent, bourgeois-democratic constitution; (c) in 
  this setting a candidate Bonaparte. The real power rests in the principal working 
  class parties. A would-be Hitler striving for power and a Hitler in power are 
  not one and the same thing. A would-be Bonaparte like de Gaulle and a real Bonaparte 
  wielding real personal power with the sword, are two different things. De Gaulle 
  may yet be a French Franco, but one does not declare the enemy victorious before 
  the decisive battle has begun.</p>


<p>Bonapartism in the modern epoch, by its very nature, must be a regime of transition 
  - transition to fascism, transition to democracy, or even to proletarian revolution: 
  a period of manoeuvring between the classes. That there are <em>elements of Bonapartism 
  in the situation in Europe, goes without saying. </em>These elements can be transformed 
  into the dominant ones, but only under certain conditions. If one declares a 
  regime Bonapartist, then the specific features of the regime must be brought 
  out. In spite of Pierre Frank's zealous endeavours to elevate de Gaulle into 
  a position to which he only aspired, the 'Bonaparte' de Gaulle, measuring the 
  relation of forces, was forced to retire sadly from the scene to await a more 
  propitious moment.</p>


<p>There precisely is the nub of the question: it is necessary to answer Stalinist 
  and socialist propaganda by warning that their policies inevitably bring the 
  dangers of counter-revolution and Bonapartism: to warn of the threat of military-police 
  dictatorship which hangs over the proletariat if it does not disperse the Bonapartist 
  nests, composed of the cadres of the general staff, police and civil bureaucracy, 
  and take power into its own hands.</p>


<p>Comrades must not make the mistake of the German communists who declared every 
  regime in turn 'fascist' till in the end, by their lulling and confusing the 
  advance guard, the real Hitler arrived. Of course, if Pierre Frank continues 
  to repeat it long enough, no doubt reality will, in the end, coincide with his 
  definition and we will have a Bonapartist regime in France and other countries 
  in Europe. But for Marxists this is not good enough. We must painstakingly analyse 
  and explain every change in government. In that way we can prepare for the events 
  to come.</p>


<h4>Was the Kerensky Regime 'Bonapartist'?</h4>

<p>Scattered through his article, Frank refers to 'Bonapartist <em>a-la-</em>Kerensky', 
  the Bonapartism of Kerensky, thus assuming that Bonapartism had in fact been 
  established under the Kerensky regime - entirely unwarranted by a knowledge 
  of the period.</p>


<p>Frank takes one or two conditional formulations of Lenin and Trotsky in relation 
  to the Kerensky regime in Russia and tries to convert them into hard and fast 
  definitions. In reality, the record speaks against him. It is significant to 
  note that the chapter in the <em>History of the Russian Revolution </em>to which 
  he refers, is headed, not 'Bonapartism', but <em>Kerensky and Kornilov - Elements 
  of Bonapartism in the Russian Revolution. </em>Trotsky was always particularly 
  careful on definitions and thus when he says 'elements', he does not mean the 
  thing itself. And for very good reason. No doubt Kerensky would have <em>liked 
  </em>to play the role of Bonaparte. The possibilities of Bonapartism were rooted 
  in the situation. But Bonapartism was never achieved because the Bolshevik Party 
  was strong and achieved. the proletarian revolution, leaving no avenue for adventurers 
  to take control. Many citations could be given to show the conditional nature 
  of the characterisation of the Kerensky regime as Bonapartist. In the very section 
  quoted by Comrade Frank, from which he abstracts the single sentence characterising 
  Kerensky as 'the mathematical centre of Russian Bonapartism', Trotsky wrote:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The two hostile camps invoked Kerensky, each seeing in him a part of 
  itself, and both swearing fealty to him. Trotsky wrote while in prison: 'led 
  by politicians who are afraid of their own shadow, the Soviet did not dare take 
  the power. The Kadet Party, representing all the propertied cliques, could not 
  yet seize the power. It remained to find a great conciliator, a mediator, a 
  court of arbitration.'</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;In a manifesto to the people issued by Kerensky in his own name, he declared: 
  'I, as head of the government...consider that I have no right to hesitate if 
  the changes (in the structure of the government)...increase my responsibility 
  in the matters of supreme administration.' <em>That is the unadulterated phraseology 
  of Bonapartism. But nevertheless, although supported from both right and left 
  it never got beyond phraseology</em>.'&quot; (<em>History of the Russian Revolution 
  </em>, Sphere, Volume III page 155. Our emphasis)
<sup><a href="../../../trotsky/1930/hrr/ch29.htm">[source]</a></sup>
</p>


<p class="fst">Trotsky wrote this as a historian, soberly evaluating and weighing every word. 
  And if one studies the works of Lenin conscientiously, even though written in 
  the heat of events, one cannot but see the falsity of Frank's position in confusing 
  the germs with the disease. Lenin writes, for example, in his work <em>Towards 
  the Seizure of Power</em>: 'Kerensky's cabinet is indubitably the first step 
  towards Bonapartism.' (<em>Collected works </em>Volume 25 page 224)
<sup><a href="../../../lenin/works/1917/jul/29.htm">[source (translation and title differs)]</a></sup>
</p>


<p>Here can be seen the <em>conditional </em>character of what Lenin and Trotsky 
  were talking about. In the very section of <em>State and Revolution </em>quoted 
  by Frank, in which Lenin refers to the Kerensky government as Bonapartist, the 
  conditional character of this is shown by the paragraphs immediately following. 
  In dealing with the state and all its forms in <em>an instrument for the 
  exploitation of the Oppressed Class </em>(that is what the chapter is headed 
  in which these references to Bonapartism occur, and that is what Lenin is dealing 
  with), he goes on to say:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;In a democratic republic, Engels continues, 'wealth wields its power 
  indirectly, but all the more effectively', first, by means of 'direct corruption 
  of officials' (America); second, by means of the 'alliance of the government 
  with the stock exchange' (France and America).</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;At the present time, imperialism and the domination of the banks have 
  'developed' to an unusually fine art both these methods of defending and asserting 
  the omnipotence of wealth in democratic republics of all descriptions. Since, 
  for instance, in the very first months of the Russian democratic republic, one 
  might say during the honeymoon union of the 'Socialists' - Social-Revolutionaries 
  and Mensheviks - joined in wedlock with the bourgeoisie.&quot; (CW Volume 25, 
  page 397)
<sup><a href="../../../lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch01.htm">[source (translation differs)]</a></sup>

</p>


<p class="fst">To clinch the matter, in a later section of the same pamphlet dealing with 
  the same period, in contrasting a soviet to a parliamentary body, Lenin goes 
  on to say:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;'A working, and not a parliamentary body' - this hits the vital spot 
  of present-day parliamentarians and the parliamentary social-democratic 'lap-dogs'! 
  Take any parliamentary country, from America to Switzerland, from France to England, 
  Norway and so forth - the actual work of the 'state' there is done behind the 
  scenes and is carried out by the departments, the offices and the staffs. Parliament 
  itself is given up to talk for the special purpose of the fooling the 'common 
  people'. <em>This is so true that even in the Russian Republic, a bourgeois democratic 
  republic, all these aims of parliamentarism were immediately revealed, even 
  before a real parliament was created</em>...&quot; (CW Volume 25, page 428. Our 
  emphasis).
<sup><a href="../../../lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch03.htm">[source (translation differs)]</a></sup>
</p>


<p class="fst">We would have to reduce Lenin to a mass of stupid contradictions if we used 
  the method of Pierre Frank. For him there is no real contradiction because he 
  makes no real contradiction between bourgeois democracy and Bonapartism. If 
  he carried this through he would have to argue that we had <em>both </em>bourgeois 
  democracy and Bonapartism in France and his objection to the term 'bourgeois 
  democratic regime' becomes entirely incomprehensible.</p>


<p>Frank points to the fact that the British comrades have referred to the Labour 
  government in Britain as a Kerensky regime and then proceeds to argue that this 
  is incorrect because we have not a Bonpartist regime in this country:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Since we here speak of the resolution of our English comrades let us 
  note that it defines the new Labour government as 'Kerenskyism'. The Bonapartism, 
  that they ignored, has found the means to insinuate itself into their document 
  under a very special name. But we do not think the present Attlee government 
  is Bonapartist <em>a-la</em>-Kerensky.&quot;</p>


<p class="fst">This merely serves to demonstrate that Frank has not understood the meaning 
  of the Kerenskiad or of Bonapartism. The Kerenskiad is the last, or 'one before 
  the last' left government before the proletarian revolution, or, we may add, 
  the bourgeois counter-revolution. Under given conditions, the social tensions 
  and sharp conflicts of the classes in such a period would tend to give rise 
  to Bonapartist conspiracies and plots. That is precisely what happened in the 
  Russian revolution, and that is why Lenin and Trotsky referred to the Bonapartist 
  tendencies within the Kerensky regime. However, for Comrade Frank's benefit, 
  this does not make a Kerensky regime a Bonapartist regime. Here perhaps we had 
  better make haste to add, that in referring to the Labour government as a Kerensky 
  government, this was not at all a finished evaluation, but an analogy which 
  we invested with appropriate and necessary safeguards. To put the question beyond 
  dispute, we quote from our resolution:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;At a later stage the most resolute section of the bourgeoisie will begin 
  to seek a solution in a Royalist or military dictatorship on the lines of the 
  Spanish Primo de Rivera, or some similar solution. Royalist or fascist bands 
  under the guise of ex-servicemen's or 'patriotic' associations will begin to 
  spring up.</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Events may speed up or slow down the processes but what is certain is 
  the heightening of social tension and class hatreds. <em>The period of triumphant 
  reaction has drawn to a close, a new revolutionary epoch opens up </em>in 
  <em>Britain. With many ebbs and flows, with a greater or lesser speed, the revolution 
  is beginning. </em>The Labour government is a Kerensky government. That does 
  not mean that the tempo of development will match that of the events in Russia 
  after March 1917, on the contrary, the revolution will probably assume a long 
  drawn out character but it provides the background against which the mass revolutionary 
  party will be built.&quot;</p>


<p class="fst">Fortunately, to put the position in its proper perspective, Trotsky gave a 
  definition of Kerenskyism - (he didn't call it Bonapartism!) when he dealt with 
  the false positions of the Comintern in relation to the Spanish revolution of 
  1931:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;...We see that fascism [we may add Bonapartism - EG] does not at all 
  represent the only means of the bourgeoisie in its struggle against the revolutionary 
  masses. The regime existing in Spain today (a coalition government of the bourgeois 
  republicans and Socialist Party similar to that in Italy and France today - 
  EG), corresponds best to the conception of the Kerenskiad, that is, the last, 
  (or 'one before the last') 'left' government which the bourgeoisie can only 
  set up in its struggle against the revolution. But this kind of government does 
  not necessarily signify weakness and prostration. In the absence of a strong 
  revolutionary party of the proletariat, a combination of semi-reforms, left 
  phrases and gestures still more to the left and reprisals, can prove to be of 
  much more effective service to the bourgeoisie than fascism. [We may add, naked 
  military dictatorship - EG]&quot; (<em>Germany, the key to the international 
  situation, </em>November 1931)
<sup><a href="../../../trotsky/germany/1931/311126.htm">[source]</a></sup>

<p>Frank's hazy notions of democracy and Bonapartism can be seen in his references 
  scattered throughout his article. To take a few examples:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The use of democratic slogans - combined with transitional slogans is 
  justified more precisely, <em>because the possibilities of a democratic regime 
  are non-existent</em>...&quot;</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;Precisely because <em>we do not generally have in Europe at the present 
  time democratic regimes, because there is literally no place for them</em>...&quot;</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;One must no more confuse the Bonapartism 'of the right' with fascism 
  than the Bonapartism 'of the left' with democracy. We have seen that Bonapartism 
  takes very different forms according to the conditions in which the two mortally 
  opposed camps find themselves; <em>we maintain also that the existence 
  of democratic liberties, even of very great democratic liberties, does not suffice 
  to make a regime democratic. </em>The Bonapartists <em>a-la</em>-Kerensky, Popular 
  Front...are even notorious for their flood of democratic liberty up to the point 
  where capitalist society thereby even risks its balance and is in danger of 
  capsizing. <em>Democratic liberties do not proceed, as in a regime which one 
  can correctly define as democratic, from the existence of a margin for 
  reform within capitalism, but on the contrary, from a situation of acute crisis, 
  </em>the result of the absence of all margin or reforms.&quot;</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;...<em>The regime of the Popular Front was not a democratic regime</em>; 
  it contained within itself numerous elements of Bonapartism as we shall see 
  further on.&quot;</p>


<p class="fst">The conception of democracy which is put forward by comrade Frank never existed 
  in heaven or earth. It exists only in the idealistic norms of liberalism. <em>Always, 
  democracy, ie bourgeois democracy, has been built on the framework of repression. 
  </em>Every bourgeois constitution or regime contains its Article 48 as in the 
  Weimar Constitution. The very existence of class society presupposes a regime 
  of oppression. But only one who has abandoned Marxist discipline of thought 
  and operates on the basis of metaphysical categories can equate democracy with 
  Bonapartism, or for that matter with fascism. Though there are many points of 
  similarity between these regimes, and elements of naked military rule in all 
  these regimes in one degree or another. But quantity changes into quality. What 
  dictates the nature of the regime is not this or that <em>element, </em>but its 
  <em>basic features. </em>Democracy today can become Bonapartism tomorrow and be 
  changed into fascism the next day. Fascism, as we have seen, can be transformed 
  into democracy and the process repeated.</p>


<p>The Marxist method is not to lump all regimes indiscriminately together. That 
  is the easy way, but it will lead to blunders and confusion. The Marxist method 
  is to examine things in their process of change and evolution. To examine each 
  government in turn, to establish its specific features and tendencies. To prepare 
  for abrupt changes and transitions, which is the basic characteristic of our 
  epoch, and thus to rectify and delimit, if necessary, our characterisations 
  at each successive stage. The painful limitations of Pierre Frank's method (which 
  he labels Marxism but is in reality impressionism) is summed up in his own words:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The term 'Bonapartism' does not completely exhaust the characterisation 
  of the regime, but it is indispensable to employ it in present day Europe, if 
  one wishes to go forward with the least possible chance of error. Let us add 
  finally that Marxism is not alone in the possession of such important general 
  ideas: all the sciences do likewise. Thus chemists call bodies carbides which 
  differ more widely from one another than the Bonapartism of Schliecher and that 
  of Kerensky. And chemistry doesn't get along so badly either on that account. 
  The contrary is true.&quot;</p>


<p class="fst">The Stalinists used the same method during the Third Period with lamentable 
  results in Germany. Starting with a correct generalisation that all the parties 
  from social democracy to fascism were agents of the capitalist class...they 
  ended up by saying that, therefore...there was no difference between them - 
  all were fascists of different varieties. For the scientist as for the Marxist, 
  the problem begins where, for Frank, it ends. A chemist can classify certain 
  bodies under a general heading of carbides. But a chemist who stopped at this 
  definition would not get along so well! If, for example, on the basis that a 
  chemist had defined silicon carbide (carborundum) and calcium carbide, all under 
  the same heading of 'carbides', one attempted to work an acetylene lamp on a 
  bicycle with the former instead of the latter, some very sad results would occur. 
  It would not be possible to light the path ahead. No more can Frank's method 
  cast light on the nature of the regimes in Europe.</p>
