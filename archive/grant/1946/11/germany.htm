The
elections in Germany
are an indication of the mood of the German people. Despite the fact that the
occupying authorities have the decisive say in the running of industry and
government, 80 percent and over voted in all zones, a higher percentage than in
the elections in France and Britain.
</p>
<p>
The
election indicates that the German masses are recovering from the apathy and
despair engendered by the ruin of Germany in the war and the
oppressive rule of the conquerors. They are searching for a road into the
future which will offer them hope.
</p>
<h4>Soviet Zone</h4>
<p class="fst">
In
the Soviet Zone in the provincial elections the Socialist Unity Party received
4,019,000 votes, the Christian Democrats 2,271,000 and the Liberal Democrats
1,730,000. Many workers spoiled their votes, abstained or even voted for the
capitalist parties as a protest against the suppression of the Social
Democrats, but the majority voted for the Socialist Unity Party as the only
workers&#8217; party allowed to stand.
</p>
<p>
In
the Soviet zone the Stalinist bureaucracy has carried out the nationalisation
of all big industry that is left in the area. But the real control, and in a
large number of cases, the ownership is in the hands of the Russian
bureaucracy.
</p>
<p>
In
order to facilitate the handling of the zone, the Stalinist bureaucracy forced
through the fusion of the Social Democratic Party and the Stalinist Party. This
was to conceal the weakness of the Communist Party among the German masses, as
a result of the bureaucracy and the excesses of the backward elements of the
Red Army, inflamed by the chauvinist incitement of Ehrenburg and his variety.
</p>
<p>
The
systematic looting and carting off of the possessions of the German masses,
together with the stripping of the factories as reparations, has aroused the
indignation of the German people. The attitude of the masses was demonstrated
in the Berlin
and Western Zone.
</p>
<h4>Western
Zone</h4>
<p class="fst">
In
the British Zone, which included the highly industrialised Ruhr,
the Social Democrats received 12,000,000 votes and the Communist Party only
2,400,000. The capitalist parties received 11,000,000 for the Christian
Democrats and 4,000,000 for the other parties.
</p>
<p>
In
the American and French zones the Christian Democrats received the majority of
the votes, with the Social Democrats close behind, while the Communist Party
received a small minority.
</p>
<h4>50
percent votes for workers&#8217; parties</h4>
<p class="fst">
But
the decisive election indicating the trend in Germany
was the election for the Municipal Council in Berlin. The Social Democrats received 49% of
the total votes (nearly 1,000,000), the Christian Democrats 454,000 and the
Socialist Unity Party almost 406,000, with the Liberal Democrats receiving
192,500.
</p>
<p>
The
elections are a striking testimony to the vitality of the German proletariat,
the continuance of its Socialist traditions in spite of the terrible
disillusionment of the past 15 years.
</p>
<p>
Despite
the capitulation of the Social Democratic and the Communist parties to the
Nazis, despite their craven and sycophantic attitude to the occupation
authorities, despite the hostility of the Labour and Stalinist parties in other
countries which abandoned all pretence of internationalism, the German working
class still clings to the ideals of communism and socialism. It is a striking
fact that the percentage of votes for the &#8220;Marxist&#8221; parties is higher today
than pre-Hitler. Whereas it was 40 percent pre-Hitler, it is nearly 50 percent
now throughout Germany,
and 70 percent in the capital. In the British General Election the vote for the
workers&#8217; parties was also approximately 50 percent.
</p>
<p>
That
the Social Democrats, who even voted for Hitler in the Reichstag after the
Nazis came to power in a futile effort to retain a legal existence, should not
only have retained their support, but gained at the expense of the Communist
Party can only be explained as the revulsion of the masses from the
totalitarian Stalinist regime.
</p>
<p>
In Berlin the process is
striking. Here, pre-Hitler, the Stalinists were the strongest Party&#8212;far
stronger than the Social Democrats. Today, despite the overwhelming superiority
of the &#8220;Socialist Unity Party&#8221; in resources propaganda apparatus, paper, etc.,
they were overwhelmingly defeated. The Stalinists also suffered heavy defeats
in their traditional strongholds&#8212;Hamburg, the
Ruhr, Leipzig and Dresden.
</p>
<p>
The
German workers want socialism: but they want a genuine workers&#8217; democracy, not
the caricature of Stalinism, which has no power of attraction for those who
have witnessed it at close quarters.
</p>
<p>
Schumacher,
leader of the Social Democrats proclaimed the victory as one denoting the
desire of &#8220;peace, freedom, democracy and socialism.&#8221; In this the reformist
party received the votes, not as an uncritical approval for the policy of
reformism, but because there was no alternative.
</p>
<p>
The
significance of the vote for the Christian Democrats is that it confirms a
trend which has developed throughout Western Europe.
The defeat of the Nazis has completed the disillusionment of the middle class.
The capitalists have organised the despairing middle class round the banner of
&#8220;Christian Democracy&#8221; as a counterweight to the workers&#8217; parties and to
socialism. The absence of a bold revolutionary policy by the workers&#8217; parties
which could rally the middle class, has resulted in their crystallisation round
this axis.
</p>
<h4>Collapse of the
Nazis</h4>
<p class="fst">
However,
what is confirmed by the elections is the utter collapse of the Nazis. The
assiduous cultivation of the myth by the Tories, Labour and Communist Party
leaders that the fascists possess a mass basis in Germany has been shown to be
utterly false by this election.
</p>
<p>
The
isolated deeds of terror and violence have been met with hostility from the
working class. In Stuttgart, the bomb planted by
the Nazis as an act against the American military government was answered by a
15-minute protest strike by 125,000 Stuttgart
workers. This was not for love of the American military government, but as a
warning to the Nazis.
</p>
<h4>Allies modify policy</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
antagonism between Anglo-American imperialism and the Stalinist bureaucracy
which has openly manifested itself since the collapse of Nazi Germany has led
the Allies to modify their attitude towards the German problem.
</p>
<p>
Germany still remains the heart of Europe and her destiny largely determines the relation of
forces and the destinies of the European peoples. Under stress of economic
facts and the game of power politics, the Allies are abandoning the policy of
Vansittartism and the &#8220;pastoralisation&#8221; of Germany. But this does not mean a
change of heart on the part of the great powers; it merely means that they
desire to use Germany as a
pawn in the struggle for mastery over Europe,
and as points of vantage against each other.
</p>
<p>
Molotov&#8217;s
recent speech in favour of a united Germany,
and opposing the separation of the Rhineland, which was echoed by a fervent
spate of propaganda by the Socialist Unity Party for a united and centralised
Reich, is a reflection of the Stalinist plans to win the support of the German
masses and dominate Germany.
</p>
<p>
Byrnes&#8217;
speech suggesting revision of the present Polish frontier with Germany (which has meant the annexation of an
enormous stretch of former German territory in Silesia) was the American rebuttal.
</p>
<p>
Now
Bevin too has criticised the extent of the Polish annexations as a thrust
against the Kremlin.
</p>
<p>
While
in the Anglo-American zones industry has remained on a stagnant level, in the
Russian zone reconstruction has developed under the control and for the benefit
of the Stalinist bureaucracy. Taking advantage of the refusal of the Stalinists
to integrate the economy of their zone with Western occupied Germany, the
Allies have used this as a pretext to renounce the terms of the Potsdam
Agreement. The American imperialists are even toying with the idea of a loan to
Germany.
</p>
<p>
Bevin
has emphasised the new policy in his latest review of foreign policy in the
House of Commons. The level of industry to be allowed in Germany is to
be revised on a much higher level. In the British zone, coal, steel, heavy
engineering, chemicals and other heavy industry <span class="inote">[is]</span> to be nationalised under
military government control. The Social Democrats, leaning for support on
British imperialism and a Western orientation, have eagerly jumped at the hint,
and while hailing Bevin&#8217;s references to industry have commenced an agitation
against the unjust frontiers in the East. Thus, while denouncing the Socialist
Unity Party for reflecting the interests of Moscow, the Social Democrats anxiously
reflect trends of British foreign policy.
</p>
<h4>For a Communist Germany</h4>
<p class="fst">
But
the disagreements between the Allies, and the attempt to balance Germany against
each other, will have unexpected results for the victors. In the Eastern Zone a
continuation of the revival of Germany
for the benefit of the occupiers is bound to give rise to a critical mood among
the masses. In the Western zone the organisation of German industry will crash
on the contradictions of restored capitalist economy. It can only lead Germany to a
new economic slump and collapse, as did the revival after the last war.
</p>
<p>
The
nationalisation of only heavy industry under bureaucratic military control,
without planning, control and initiative in the hands of the German workers,
can only prepare the way for a new reaction.
</p>
<p>
The
long-term effects of a restoration of industry will not be to the liking of the
Allied rulers of Germany.
It will restore the self-confidence and energy of the working class. It will
prepare the way for their revolutionisation, particularly among the youth of
the Social Democrats and Stalinist Parties. This can prepare the way for the
genuine Marxist party in Germany&#8212;a
mass Revolutionary Communist Party which will fight for a communist solution.
</p>
<p>
The
road out for Germany
lies in the integration of dynamic German industry with European economy. This
would lead to an undreamed of increase in the standard of living of the German
and European peoples. But it is absolutely impossible under capitalism. Only a
Socialist Germany united with a Socialist Europe can bring peace and plenty to Europe.
</p>
<p>
The
workers of Britain
must assist the rebirth of German socialism by demanding the withdrawal of all
the armies of occupation. Let the German workers deal with the Nazis and their
capitalist backers. The election results demonstrate that they have the will
and the desire to do so. The German workers will give short shrift to any
attempt at Nazi revival if they have the power to do so.
