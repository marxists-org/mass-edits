<p class="fst">Comrade of the Communist Party,</p>


<p>You have supported the Communist Party as fighters against
Capitalism-Imperialism, for its overthrow and the realisation of Socialism; a
new system of Society without classes or exploitation of man by man or nation by
nation.
<p>You believed that the Communist Party and present leadership represented that
programme; the theory and ideas of Marx and Lenin.
<p>Events have struck blows against that illusion. This is the programme which
the Communist Party and Communist International were set up to carry out and for
which the Russian workers made the October Revolution. But the Russian
Revolution degenerated through the usurpation of power by the Stalin clique. All
that remains of the great Russian revolution is the basic gain; the elimination
of Capitalism, the State Ownership of the means of production and its
development on the basis of a plan.
<p>But control was filched out of the hands of the Workers and the Peasants, and
concentrated into the hands of the Bureaucracy; the millions of officials, army
officers, managers, Party and State functionaries.
<p>Your leaders have admitted the crimes of Stalin under the impact of the
Khrushchev disclosures at the 20th Congress. The lack of democracy, the National
oppression of the non-Russian peoples, the terror against the Working Class, the
exile of millions to Siberia, the dictatorship of a clique with an unbridled
Secret Police.
<p>This applies and applied not only to Russia itself but to the regimes of
eastern Europe, in which the masses were subjected to mismanagement and plunder,
in the interests of the Russian Bureaucracy.
<p>Your leaders pretend that these were the mistakes and crimes of one man. This
is palpably false for anyone trained in the Marxist method. No dictator
represents himself alone, but the interest of a class or stratum of society. Who
then did Stalin represent? The workers? Obviously not. he stood, on the
contrary, for the forces who carried through a political counter-revolution
against the Russian masses; but a counter-revolution on the basis of state
ownership; and this terror was not for Stalin's whim but in the interests of the
material needs of these usurping officials. Even today your leaders are hiding
the fact that the present leadership in the Soviet Union is still trampling on
the programme and methods of Lenin.

<h4>Lenin's Programme</h4>

<p>Lenin summarised his programme for Workers' Power and its inception as the
first steps for a Workers' State, in order to prepare a transition to Socialism,
in four simple points.
<ol class="numbered">
  <li>The setting up of Soviets, or Committees composed of Workers, Peasants and
other Representatives of the population, with free and democratic elections to
them and the right of recall.</li>
  <li>No standing army but the armed people.</li>
  <li>No official to receive a wage higher than that of a skilled workers.</li>
  <li>Gradually all the tasks to be done in turn by the workers themselves. Every
cook should be able to be Prime Minister. When everyone is a
&quot;bureaucrat&quot; in turn no one can be a bureaucrat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Under Khrushchev as under Stalin not a single one of these fundamental points
remains in existence in Russia today. The law limiting the wage of officials has
long been abolished. the difference between managers and workers is greater than
in capitalist countries. The difference in wages and conditions between officers
and men in the army is greater than even in the USA. generals, officers and
managers are a privileged caste separate and apart from the people. The top
clique of officials under Khrushchev as under Stalin live like millionaires.
<p>Above all, this can only be maintained by the crushing of democracy and the
rights of the Working Class.

<h4>Trotsky urged five-year plan</h4>

<p>The achievements of industrialisation and the five-year plan (incidentally
put forward by Trotsky and opposed by Stalin in the early years), demonstrating
the superiority of Socialist economic methods over Capitalism, were carried
through despite bureaucratic mismanagement and corruption which hamper and hold
back the development of the productive forces.
<p>But state ownership and planning, in order to function efficiently to the
maximum extent possible, require the full participation, control, check, and
management of the workers and peasants, and only thus can the interests of the
workers and peasants be served, and the way be prepared for the transition to
Socialism and the withering away of the State. The opposite process has taken
place in Russia and her satellites. In Poland, Hungary and other countries of
Eastern Europe the Russian bureaucracy through its local representatives and
agents oppressed the masses by the same arbitrary brutal and terroristic
methods.
<p>After more than ten years of Stalinist rule this has culminated in the
uprising of the Hungarian masses. This was a magnificent, heroic national
struggle comparable to the Paris Commune and the Russian Revolution itself. Now
your leaders are up to their old games. they are desperately trying to deceive
you by resorting to the old Stalinist lies and slanders. Yesterday they
denounced Tito, Gomulka, Kostov, Rajk and Slansky as fascists,
counter-revolutionaries, imperialist agents and spies. They have recently been
compelled to make abject retractions, and to claim that they have been
&quot;honestly mistaken&quot;. Now they are up to their old games again. they
use the unholy joy of the capitalist press at the exposure of Stalinist misdeeds
and national oppression to try to confuse you. It is true that blood-stained
Imperialist Capitalism has been guilty of terrible crimes against the workers
and the peoples: Suez, Kenya, Cyprus and Malaya.
<p>But they are Capitalists-Imperialists. Their system demands such measures in
defence of their profits and privileges. But Socialism and workers' rule demand
different methods entirely, otherwise they would not be worthy of the name of
Socialism. The crimes of Stalinism under its new disguises in Russia, Poland and
Hungary are similarly in defence of inequality, national oppression,
bureaucracy, inefficiency, terror and indifference to the needs and aspirations
of the masses.
<p>Your leaders lied, or as they claim, were deceived in their previous
vituperative attacks - can you believe them now?

<h4>Again the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; lies</h4>

<p>All honest members of the Communist Party must ask themselves as a duty to
the struggle of their class for Socialism why these events have taken place and
whether their leaders are once again &quot;mistaken&quot;.
<p>It is a definite lie on the part of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; and the
government of Janos Kadar that this was a Fascist movement,
counter-revolutionary in its aims. No more than the movement in Poland was
fascist. Gero and the other Stalinist bureaucrats provoked this insurrection on
the part of the masses. A few stray hooligans or Fascist elements such as Joseph
Dudasz, whom the &quot;Daily Workers&quot; featured so prominently, tried to
take advantage of the workers' movement but were immediately arrested and put in
jail. This the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; has not revealed.
<p>As always in great events, as in the Russian Revolution of 1917, these
elements intervene in the movement. But the decisive section of the
insurrectionary forces in Hungary were from the working class and youth, the
factory workers. The elite of the Hungarian masses were and are in the van of
the struggle. The amazing capacity of the Hungarian workers to fight against
terrible odds is something which places them among the greatest working class
fighters in history. Two general strikes and two insurrections in three weeks!
Why? To restore Capitalism and Landlordism! What a dirty lie. The &quot;Daily
Worker&quot; of 15th November gives the lie to all the propaganda of these
traitors of Socialism, when they list the demands of the workers, before they
agree to go back to work. Similar demands were featured by the &quot;Daily
Worker&quot; itself as early as 27th October: the demand for a workers' National
Guard, immediate negotiations for the withdrawal of Russian troops, the right to
strike and free Trade Unions.

<h4>Hungarian workers' demands:</h4>

<ol class="numbered">
  <li>Workers' councils in every factory to establish workers' management and
    radically transform the system of State Central planning and directing.</li>
  <li>Wages to be raised immediately by 10 to 15 per cent and a ceiling of about
    106 a month fixed for the highest salaries.</li>
  <li>To abolish production norms except in factories where the workers or
    workers' councils wish to keep them.</li>
  <li>wages and pension demands.</li>
  <li>Speed up house-building.</li>
  <li>Negotiate with the Soviet Union and other countries on the principle of
    equality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Instinctively the Hungarian masses have tried to adopt the programme and
policy of Lenin as listed in the demands above.
<p>To say under these conditions that they want Capitalism back is a dirty lie
of hardened perverters of Socialism.
<p>The &quot;Daily Worker&quot; in its desperate efforts to fool the members and
supporters of the Communist Party has referred to the overthrow of the Hungarian
Republic of 1919. What they forget to mention is that this Republic had the
overwhelming support of the masses and could only be overthrown by the
intervention of foreign troops backed by Britain and France.
<p>Now the foreign troops used against the revolution are troops of Russia, just
the opposite to events at that time. The young Hungarian Soviet Republic was
overthrown by outside intervention in 1919 before it could consolidate itself.
Only foreign intervention could pave the way for a struggle by the White Guards
against the Russian Revolution. At this time World Imperialism is impotent to
intervene and in fact would be afraid of the victory of the Workers in Hungary.

<h4>For whom does Kadar speak?</h4>

<p>Yet ten years after the revolution has been consolidated in Hungary this is
the denouement. The Russian army and the puppet Government of Kadar represent
Stalinist Counter-revolution in Hungary. With the defeat of the Government the
workers instantaneously organised revolutionary committees of workers, soldiers,
students, peasants, even lawyers, so strong was the revolutionary feeling in
Hungary. These revolutionary committees were Soviets, but Russian and
Stalinist-Hungarian oppression has made the name Soviet stink so much that the
masses called them revolutionary committees. These committees, based on the
factories, regiments, etc., are the most democratic form it is possible to
achieve. yet the first act of the Kadar Government after the second treacherous
intervention by Russian troops was to order the dissolution of the soldiers'
committees and the appointment of &quot;Commissars&quot; as overlords to the
Workers' committees. It is significant that this too the &quot;Daily
Worker&quot; fails to mention or explain!
<p>The &quot;Worker&quot; contradicts itself when at the same time it is giving
currency to the lies about Fascist and Imperialist agents, it admits the need of
basic reform in Poland and Hungary.
<p>How could Fascist or Imperialist agents have any effect if there were not
this justified discontent of the masses against Stalinist absolutism? Even if it
were true, the responsibility would be on the shoulders of the Russian,
Hungarian and British CP Bureaucracy, which condoned and concealed these crimes.
Of course, the Imperialist butchers seek to discredit the idea of Socialism by
using the crimes of the so-called Communist Party.
<p>It is surely clear that the Hungarian masses do not wish to go back to
Horthyism and Capitalism. But they want to end, once and for all, the domination
and bleeding of Hungary for the benefit of the Russian Bureaucracy. That is why
they are demanding the publication of the pointedly secret trade treaties
between the Soviet Union and Hungary. In Poland even Gomulka, under the pressure
of the masses, has come out against Russian domination and for the withdrawal of
Russian troops.

<h4>What Lenin said</h4>

<p>What the Hungarian masses are trying to do instinctively, without yet having
at their heads the tried and tested consciously revolutionary Socialist and
Communist leadership the situation so urgently demands, is to adopt the precepts
of Lenin. Lenin warned of Stalinist methods in Georgia as an example of national
oppression. Lenin also warned of the consequences of bureaucratism, inequality
and arbitrary methods of command. The methods in Eastern Europe are a thousand
times worse than the ones that Lenin castigated.
<p>Comrades of the Communist Party! The entry of the Russian Army is to
consolidate Stalinist counter-revolution against the legitimate demands of the
Hungarian people. A simple test can be used. Why has not the slogan been raised
by the Russians and the Hungarian Communist Parties, the slogan of Lenin to
safeguard the revolution in 1917: All Power to a Central Council of the
Revolutionary Committees! For a Workers' Socialist Hungary, with full democracy
for all tendencies accepting state ownership and planning, for workers'
management of industry, for the withdrawal of the Russian troops, for the right
of the Hungarian people to decide their own fate without interference.
<p>In a confused way that is the programme of the Hungarian masses. Leaflets
issued by the workers and the intellectuals in Budapest under the heels of the
Russian occupation have been groping for this solution. This is the programme of
Socialism, not of counter-revolution.
<p>The Hungarian political revolution has taken a nationalist form because of
the bureaucratic national oppression of Stalinism. But the Hungarians, no more
than the workers of other countries, can solve their problems in isolation. The
Hungarian masses must appeal to the rank and file of the Red Army, to the
workers of Russia, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and of the world, if they are
to be successful.
<p>Instead of nationalism, internationalism! For a Socialist Federation of all
the Balkan States with full national autonomy.

<h4>Back to Lenin!</h4>

<p>Comrade of the Communist Party! Back to the programme and policy of Lenin! We
appeal to you: remember the saying of Lenin, that one should study one's
opponents in the working class movement conscientiously. Read the works of Lenin
and Trotsky, where these events are foreshadowed and explained in advance.
<p>These titanic events in Russia, Hungary and Poland, and the invasion at Suez,
plus the storms that are heralded, show the need for a real Socialist programme
for Britain. An alternative must be offered to the reformism of the Labour Party
and the neo-reformism of the Communist Party leadership.
<p>For the last 20 years and more, the policy of your leaders has been dictated
by the foreign policy of the Russian bureaucracy. Your leaders still pursue a
policy which is not in the interest of the workers of Hungary, Britain or
Russia, but nationally and internationally, a reflection of the need of the
foreign policy of the Russian Bureaucracy.

<h4>The only road:</h4>

<p>Comrades! new shocks lie ahead. Yesterday the 20th Congress, today Hungary,
tomorrow...(?)
<p>The intervention of Russian troops was designed to prevent the setting up of
a Socialist Democracy on the borders of Russia, because this would have been the
beginning of the end for the Russian bureaucracy. Already some Russian soldiers
have deserted to the side of the Hungarian people. This is an omen of the
future! The intervention of Russian troops prevented the masses establishing a
Socialist democracy in Hungary, but in the future when the Russian masses rise,
who will defend the Russian Bureaucracy then? In the coming period great events
impend, in the East against Stalinism, in the West against Capitalism. We can
best help the workers of Russia and Eastern Europe by conducting an implacable
struggle for the overthrow of Capitalism and Imperialism in Britain and the
West.
<p>Comrade of the Communist Party! You can best help in this task by a clear
understanding of the problems of the Working Class and the theory and practice
of Marxism and Leninism. We are convinced that you will come to understand that
the revolutionary struggle can be carried through to a victorious conclusion in
Britain and internationally only on the programme of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky,
which your leaders have abandoned.</p>
