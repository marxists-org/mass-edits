<p class="fst">
The
swastika together with anti-Jewish slogans has reappeared in Germany, on the
walls of synagogues, churches, halls and schools. Hooligan and lunatic
elements, all over the world, have followed suit. In London and other cities in
Britain, in France, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and as far afield as the
United States and Australia there have been swastika daubings and anti-Semitic
slogans. This demonstrates, at any rate, that the phenomena of anti-Semitism
and fascism, are not specifically German.
</p>
<p>
The
advanced elements in the world Labour Movement are afraid that once again a new
fascist menace is appearing in Germany. The capitalist press, the leaders of
the Communist Party and many leaders of the Labour Movement, including sincere
Left-wingers, have posed the question as if this was something peculiar to the
German character. Certainly the elements which backed, financed and organised
Hitler are back in power in Western Germany. (But the capitalist rulers of
Britain, France and the United States fearing the Socialist revolution in
Germany, also supported Hitler financially and in other ways before he came to
power. They supported the re-armament of Germany and her initial seizures of
territory, as a basis for using her for war against Russia. They were just as
responsible for the Nazis coming to power as the German capitalists).
</p>
<h4>Same
old Nazi backers</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
Anglo-American, French and German Governments have allowed the
multi-millionaire backers of the Nazis, Krupp and Flick, to regain their
property, privileges and power in the Federal Republic. 1,000 of the judges in
the Federal Republic of Germany held judicial office under Hitler. People
holding high positions in the police, civil servants, teachers and editors,
were all concerned in the crimes of the Nazis, as they held high posts under
Hitler. Two of the ministers in the present Christian Democratic Government,
Herr Globke, responsible for the commentary for the Nuremberg racial decrees
against the Jews and Professor Oberlander, the present Federal Minister for
Refugees, were high up members of the Nazi Party. The Minister of the Interior
Dr. Schroeder, who has been groomed by Adenauer and his successor, has also
been a member of the Nazi Party. &#8220;A weeding out of former Nazis would almost
denude some Federal Ministries of their civil servants. The Federal Foreign
Office would be deprived of some of its acknowledged experts. The foreign and
consular services would suffer severely <em>so
would the police force</em>, the legal and teaching professions, and local
government. Ironically the <em>Bundeswehr</em>
(German Army)&#8212;about whose staffing most fuss has been made&#8212;would be least
affected,&#8221; writes the <em>Manchester Guardian</em>
of January 1<sup>st</sup>.
</p>
<h4>Former
Nazis defended</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
real situation was shown when the Social-Democratic deputies in the Bavarian
Parliament&#8217;s legal committee moved that &#8220;the judicial apparatus be speedily
cleansed from people having had an active part in legal crimes during the Third
Reich.&#8221; They demanded the expulsion of 200 of Hitler&#8217;s special and military
court judges and prosecutors from Bavaria&#8217;s legal apparatus. The Bavarian
Minister of Justice Haas justified their retention on the grounds that they had
&#8220;applied the law&#8221; on the basis of &#8220;what they regarded as right&#8221;&#8230;&#8220;In God&#8217;s name
one must bear with them.&#8221; From a <em>capitalist
class</em> point of view this is perfectly logical. The capitalists used the
Nazis in the interests of their profits. If they do not support the Nazis <em>now</em> it is because these criminal maniacs
are not necessary, at the present time, to hold down the working class in
subjection, and destroy their organisations.
</p>
<p>
It
must never be forgotten that the overwhelming majority of the working class in
Germany was opposed to the Nazis. Before coning to power and organising the
terror Hitler never even received a majority of the votes in Parliamentary
elections. The middle class who supported him did so in desperation, because of
the failure of the Social-Democratic and Communist Party leaderships to show a
way out to the German people, on the road of socialism. Even at the last minute
the failure of the Communist Party and Social-Democratic leaders to organise a
United Front, to prevent Hitler coming to power at all costs, was responsible
for Hitler&#8217;s victory. The Labour and Communist Party leaders in Britain, justified
this betrayal.
</p>
<p>
Citrine
at the Conference of the T.U.C. in 1933, after the coming to power of the
Nazis, justified the refusal of the Trade Union leaders in Germany, to call a
general strike, because he said it would have meant civil war in Germany!
</p>
<p>
The
Communist Party leaders in Britain opposed the setting up of a united front in
Germany, between the Communist Party and the Social-Democrats, which could have
prevented Hitler from coming to power. They did this in obedience to the
&#8220;theory&#8221; of Stalin of &#8220;Social-Fascism&#8221; which declared that the main enemy was
not Hitler but the Social-Democrats. A few months before Hitler came to power
the <em>Daily Worker</em> was still jeering,
&#8220;It is significant that Trotsky has come out in defence of a united front
between the Communist and Social Democratic Parties against Fascism. No more
disruptive and counter-revolutionary class lead could possibly have been given
at a time like the present.&#8221; They are as much responsible for the crimes of the
Nazis as their brother parties in Germany.
</p>
<h4>Anti-German
racialism</h4>
<p class="fst">
It
is nauseating in the light of these facts to see the campaign to blur the <em>class</em> nature of fascism, and picture it
as a peculiar aberration of the German people. The <em>Daily Mail</em>, which has a particularly vicious record of supporting
fascism in Germany, Italy, Spain <em>and
Britain</em>, in the pre-war period, is in the van of the yelping pack. The <em>Daily Express</em>, and the Beaverbrook press
generally, are not far behind. But the most shameful of all has been the <em>Daily Worker</em>. These professed
&#8220;Communists&#8221; are without shame or working class honour, in their eagerness to
smear <em>the whole of the German people</em>.
Their words are practically identical with those of the <em>Daily Mail</em> and the <em>Daily
Express</em>. In its Editorial of December 31<sup>st</sup> the <em>Daily Worker</em> sneeringly declares:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;After
the war it was common to hear the excuse: &#8216;we didn&#8217;t know what was going on&#8217; <em>from the Germans</em>. (our emphasis) Today,
the same sort of people who &#8216;didn&#8217;t know&#8217; are trying to tell us that we should
&#8216;not worry&#8217; about the latest outbreak of anti-Semitism.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Efforts
to play down the meaning of what is happening can be expected from people who
share the guilt of these filthy crimes.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;But
it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing to find <em>British papers</em> (our emphasis) like the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> also attempting to whitewash these disgusting
events&#8230; the need for all, of whatever political or religious outlook, to act to
defend mankind against a revival of this murderous insanity?&#8221;
</p>
<h4>Class
nature of Fascism</h4>
<p class="fst">
What
is &#8220;disgraceful&#8221; and &#8220;dangerous&#8221; is the extent of the degeneration of the
leadership of the Communist Party. Nowhere in their propaganda on this question
do they put a <em>class</em> point of view. It
is correct, of course, to appeal to the humanitarian instincts of the middle
class, as well as the workers, but Fascism cannot be destroyed under any form
it may take, unless at least the advanced elements in the Labour Movement
understand how it arose, its capitalist nature and how to fight it.
</p>
<p>
To
blame the whole of the German people for the crimes of the Nazis would be no
better or worse than <em>to blame the whole
of the British people</em> for the crimes of British Imperialism in Kenya, in
the &#8220;internment camps&#8221; such as Hola, and the crimes of the bloodstained past of
British Imperialism. <em>Fascism means
primarily the complete destruction of all working class organisations; trade
unions, all working class parties and even clubs</em>. <em>It means the abolition of all the democratic rights they have won in
struggle against capitalism in the last century: the right to strike, organise,
demonstrate, free speech and press, etc.</em>
</p>
<p>
These
latest manifestations, at any rate, are a crushing condemnation of the Right
Wing Socialist attitude, that capitalism has reformed itself. They come at a
time when &#8220;prosperity&#8221; is at its height particularly in Western Germany, with
its so-called &#8220;Economic miracle.&#8221; Just when the German Social-Democratic
leadership has shamefully abandoned all pretence of standing for a fundamental
change in the economy, these criminal outbursts indicate the subterranean
processes taking place in capitalist society, in Germany, in Britain and other
countries.
</p>
<h4>Special
powers against the workers</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
reason why the West German State is riddled through and through with former
Nazi elements, lies in the capitalist structure of society. If they felt their
power threatened by the working class, they would once again, in desperation,
turn to totalitarian dictatorship as a solution; most probably in a somewhat
different form with different slogans, because of the discrediting and exposure
of the Nazi race maniacs.
</p>
<p>
There
is only a remnant of 30 to 40,000 German Jews left compared with half a million
before Hitler came to power. They are mostly old people. The Jews in Germany,
before Hitler, were mainly middle class and professional people, who competed
for jobs as doctors and lawyers, architects and accountants, with the so-called
Aryans. With the failure of the workers&#8217; organisations to show a way out of the
economic crisis for Germany, Hitler won the middle class to his insane policy. But it
would be difficult under these circumstances &#8209; small numbers and lack of
economic power &#8209; to make a scapegoat of the Jews for the crimes of capitalism. That is why, probably, the
Deutsche Reich Party of neo-Nazis, is concentrating on purely nationalist
slogans at the present time, and leaving anti-Semitism as an under-tone.
</p>
<p>
The
Mosley fascists disseminated Jew-baiting propaganda pre-war, and in the
immediate post-war period. But now Mosley pretends that his &#8220;Movement&#8221; has
never been anti-Semitic.
</p>
<p>
While
the Adenauer Government has been very gentle and forbearing with the gangsters
of fascism, giving high officials pensions and good conditions, they are <em>preoccupied at the present time</em> with
preparing to <em>fight the German workers</em>
with draconian legislation.
</p>
<p>
The
Bonn Minister of the Interior is preparing to introduce legislation allowing <em>dictatorial rule by decree</em>. Special
powers against strikes, powers to declare a &#8220;national emergency&#8221; in the event
of a &#8220;Communist&#8221; uprising, and to inset any &#8220;national emergency&#8221;, &#8220;arising from
inside or outside&#8221;. The vice President of the West German Constitutional Court,
Dr. Katz, warned at the beginning of December that the present &#8220;<em>Economic and political fine weather</em>&#8221; in
the Federal Republic could not last indefinitely, and that &#8220;<em>labour troubles must be expected</em>&#8221;. He
demanded that special powers be given the Government for use if Parliament was
prevented from exercising its function.
</p>
<p>
The
new legislation would give the Minister power to direct labour, to maintain
essential services, and food supplies. It would abolish the secrecy of the
postal services, limit the rights of free speech, and assembly, and give the
police the right to enter private dwellings without search warrants. It could
be used against strikes, and trade union and working class demonstrations.
</p>
<h4>Nazi
support negligible</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
Social Democrats have been willing to concede special powers in the event of
war. This is a betrayal. But they are <em>opposing</em>,
without conducting a campaign on the question, the use of these powers in peace
time, though (as the Communist Party, which is illegal in the Federal Republic,
is very small) the legislation is aimed at the Labour and trade union
organisations of the working class.
</p>
<p>
The
trade unions, the German T.U.C., and the Social-Democratic Party, have been
conducting a campaign demanding that all associated with Hitler&#8217;s crimes should
be dismissed from the apparatus of the State. They have protested against the
permeation of the State by former leading Nazis, and the control of industry by
former fascist supporters. They have demanded energetic measures by the State
against all guilty of racial or fascist incitement. They have not learned the
terrible lessons of history. They are following in the footsteps of the
pre-Hitler Social-Democrats, who appealed to the &#8220;State&#8221; to take action. The
&#8220;State&#8221; took &#8220;action&#8221;. It gave power to Hitler at a time when his movement
threatened to fall to pieces. The policy of relying on the State led to the
destruction of the German Labour Movement.
</p>
<p>
At
the present time the neo-Nazi support is negligible. The Deutsches Reich Party,
which is the closest approximation to the Nazis received less than 1 percent of
the votes, in elections in Germany. It has not got a single member of
Parliament. They lost half of their votes in the Lower Saxony Province, between
1954 and 1958, in what was formerly their strongest base. Their total vote in
the Federal election of 1956 was 300,000.
</p>
<p>
<em>The real danger in Germany
at the moment</em>
is the measure being prepared by the Government for use against the working
class. <em>The only way to fight against the
danger of fascism is to fight against the system which breeds fascism</em>. No
bans or prescriptions will solve the problem, either in Britain or in Germany.
To the bestial racialism and nationalism of the Fascists must be counterposed
the international solidarity of the working class.
</p>
<p>
The
&#8220;practical&#8221; way for the Labour Movement, of dealing with this menace, lies in
the winning of the masses, including the middle class, to support a Socialist
programme; for the overthrow of capitalism.
