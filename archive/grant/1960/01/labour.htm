The insidious attempt to undermine the basic class policies
of the Labour Movement is being continued by the &#8220;Frognal coterie&#8221;<sup class="ednote"><a href="#footed-1" name="doced-1">[A]</a></sup>.
After Douglas Jay&#8217;s demand that Labour abandon the attempt to extend
nationalisation, Gaitskell&#8217;s disguised attack on the Socialist objectives of
the Labour Party under the guise of modernising the constitution, comes Tony
Crosland&#8217;s statement to an international Labour conference in Holland that social
changes have &#8220;rendered the traditional anti-capitalism of the Left irrelevant.&#8221;
He echoes the veiled attack on the trade union connections of the Labour
Movement by Douglas Jay, and implies that the continued use of the name
&#8220;Labour&#8221; is an electoral liability.
</p>
<p>
These ideas were expressed at the conference over the
week-end January the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup>. Everything in the
capitalist garden is apparently neatly in order&#8230;&#8220;we have full employment, the
Welfare State and the prospect in 10 years&#8217; time of a car to every
working-class family. For a party of protest there is a good deal less to
protest about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Thus the rosy picture fills in any gaps in the claim of
Macmillan: &#8220;You never had it so good.&#8221; Except perhaps that Macmillan&#8217;s boasts
are a little more moderate and restrained.
</p>
<h4>Arguments [of the] right wing</h4>
<p class="fst">
Let us for the moment accept the arguments of the Right
Wing. In that case what would be gained by hiding the class basis of Labour&#8217;s
programme? It would be transparently easy for the Tories to expose it, consequently
Labour would get an even bigger hiding at the polls. On the other hand if as
they desire Labour changes its policy to what would amount to a Radicalism
hardly distinguishable from that of Liberalism, or the Bow Group of Tories, why
should the electors, as the Tories vulgarly expressed it, change their support
of a &#8220;winning team&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
What would be the purpose for the working class if
capitalism can continue to deliver the goods indefinitely, for the existence of
an alternative Party of Socialism? The real essence of what those people are
suggesting is not <em>something new</em> but a
return to the system which existed before the First World War, of <em>alternative Liberal and Tory Governments</em>,
of which in reality there was no fundamental difference of principle! It was a
question of Tweedledum and Tweedledee! The position in America today of the
artificial divisions between the Democrats and the Republicans. (In America the
tendency of the workers is to become more and more discontented with the
position of the Labour Movement as an appendage of the Democrats. It may not be
too far in the distant future before the American workers form their own Party
of Labour, in opposition to the two parties of Wall Street capitalism).
</p>
<p>
The Crosland-Jays want to throw us 50 years backward. But at
least 50 years ago the trade unions were an unofficial appendage of the Liberal
Party. Now Crosland wants to break the connections as discrediting the Labour
Party!
</p>
<h4>Labour traditions</h4>
<p class="fst">
Fortunately the British Labour Movement was built over
decades of struggle to break the links of class collaboration, for the trade
unions and working class to function independent of capitalism; and for a
transformation of the social system. It is no accident that nearly all the
trade unions have a clause in their constitutions, making Socialism, or the
common ownership of the means of production, one of their aims. The workers
learned this lesson in bitter experience.
</p>
<p>
If the conditions of the working class in the &#8220;overtime
state&#8221; are somewhat better this is because of the <em>organisation and struggle</em> of the workers through the trade unions
and Labour Party. The fact that the majority of the American workers families
have motor cars did not prevent the magnificent struggle of the American steel
workers for a bigger share in the wealth they have been producing. If as
Crosland argues the &#8220;public&#8221; (does he mean the middle class, influenced by the
capitalist press?) is hostile to strikes, then all that it proves is that the
trade union and Labour Movement hove failed in their duty to <em>explain the facts</em> to the people. The <em>working class share</em> of the wealth they
are producing, according to official Government statistics <em>has dropped enormously </em>in the last decade. <em>The share of the capitalists in the division of the national income has
enormously increased</em>.
</p>
<p>
If for a fleeting few years the standards of the workers
have increased by overwork, by the capitalists exploiting the entire family,
instead of only one wage earner, that does not mean a fundamental change in the
nature of capitalism. The total workers&#8217; share of the increased cake has
dropped. The superiority of Marxism over all other tendencies in the Labour
Movement is that it <em>bases itself on the
science of perspectives</em>.
</p>
<p>
Gaitskell, Crosland, Jay and other Right Wing intellectuals
reflect the <em>pressure of capitalism</em>,
of the ideas and interests of the capitalist class, within the Labour Movement.
They reflect the momentary upward swing of the capitalist economy. They are
remote from the real problems of the workers. With their comfortable middle
class incomes and outlook, how can they feel the indignities of the railwaymen,
of the miners faced with redundancy, of the motor car workers subjected to
unbearable tension and strain on the conveyor belt, of the engineers who have
practically doubled productivity in 10 years, and whose wages do not remotely
approximate to this increased wealth, of the labourers fighting an impossible
battle to bring up families on &#163;7 or &#163;8 per week.
</p>
<h4>Abandon Socialism</h4>
<p class="fst">
In any case the present state of capitalist prosperity will
change to that of disastrous slump at a later stage. The very piling up of
wealth, and the decreased share of the workers and consumers guarantees that at
a certain stage in the development of the capitalist economy. For 30 pieces of
silver, in a modest increase of the standards of living&#8212;grudgingly conceded by
the pressure of the Labour Movement&#8212;they are willing to abandon Labour&#8217;s
historic programme.
</p>
<p>
Despite the so-called prosperity, capitalism is completely
incapable of salving the problems of the British and world peoples. There is
the colossal wastage of armaments, the insanity of national frontiers in the
age of atomic energy; there is in Britain the criminal backwardness of the
machine tool industry, because it would not pay the capitalists to modernise
it. This has reduced it to the same obsolete state as the steel, coal and other
industries ruined by capitalism in the last 50 years. It required
nationalisation before these industries were modernised. The inadequacy of
science, of education, and modern technique is notorious. This threatens to
reduce Britain to the status of a third-class power, <em>far inferior in these respects</em> to China, Poland and the Balkan
Republics of yesterday, which were among the most backward countries in the world.
</p>
<p>
These petty, smug, self-satisfied parliamentarians, without
breadth of vision, without perspectives, without idealism, wish to reduce the
Labour Party to the level of a second rate Liberal Party. Although within a
measurable period of time the hopeless incapacity of the capitalist system to
even guarantee a decent standard of living for all will be exposed in all its
nakedness. Even from a &#8220;national&#8221; point of view, which seems to be their prime
concern, only the overthrow of capitalism could lead to the maximum use of the
resources of science and technique. This would mean undreamed of vistas of
culture, prosperity and progress if industry were <em>nationalised</em> and run democratically. Instead of production being
run anarchically for the benefit of the handful of monopolists controlling 600
firms which concentrate the major part of production in their hands, it could
be planned and organised for the benefit of all.
</p>
<h4>Defend common ownership</h4>
<p class="fst">
Had this perspective been presented to the workers it would
have meant victory either in the last election or the next one. If Jay,
Gaitskell, Crosland and the other Tory and Liberal fellow travellers
infiltrating the Labour Party do not accept the aims of the constitution, we
suggest that the Labour Party does not change its name&#8230;the best course for them
would be to change to a Party more congenial to their point of view!
</p>
<p>
In the coming conferences of the trade unions and at
meetings of the Constituency Parties, all Socialists should support resolutions
moved in defence of clause 4 of the constitution which states: &#8220;To secure for
the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most
equitable distribution thereof that may be possible, upon the basis of the
common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, and the
best possible system of popular administration and control of each industry or
service.&#8221;
