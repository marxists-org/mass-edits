A fierce
if disguised dispute has broken out between the rulers of the Soviet
Union and of China. The real essence of the dispute is veiled by both
sides with an ideological cover. The argument had been carried on in
the Russian and Chinese press, without directly naming the adversary.
The essence of the dispute, at least on the surface, is whether the
laws worked out by Lenin on the nature of imperialism and the
inevitability of war under capitalism still remain in the present
epoch, or whether there is a fundamental change in the situation as
argued by the Russian Stalinists which means that war can be avoided
even though imperialism still continues to exist.
</p>
<p>
Without
mentioning names the Chinese are waging a fierce struggle against
&#8220;revisionism&#8221;, with telling quotations from the works of Lenin,
to demonstrate that so long as capitalism continues to exist the
danger of war, especially from such mighty powers as the United
States still threatens to overwhelm the peoples of the world. They
are continually exposing the plots and crimes of the imperialists in
relation to the colonial peoples. Their shafts against &#8220;revisionism&#8221;
are clearly directed against the policy of the Russian bureaucratic
leaders. In their turn the Russians have attacked &#8220;dogmatism&#8221; and
&#8220;ultra-leftism&#8221;. The dispute has been proceeding for months and
has now reached the stage where the Russian provincial press is
openly attacking the Chinese leadership and making it unmistakably
clear that the recent withdrawal of technicians from China is
connected with this dispute. It is intended as a warning to the
Chinese that unless they draw in their horns, the Russian leadership
is even prepared for an open break with all the disadvantages that
that would bring nationally and internationally.
</p>
<p>
The
argument put forward by the Russian leadership, which by and large
has been supported by the leadership of the communist parties in
Western Europe and in the countries controlled by the Stalinists in
Eastern Europe, has been that the strengthening of the power of the
Stalinist states and the weakening of imperialism has made it
possible for the continuation of &#8220;peaceful co-existence&#8221; till the
growth of the industrial, technical and educational preponderance of
the Soviet Union and its satellites will be such as to result in a
peaceful transition to socialism on the part of the capitalist
states.
</p>
<p>
Now it is
clear to everyone that the situation is somewhat different to the
epoch in which Lenin wrote. But the fundamentals of the situation in
a class society remain the same. The nature of capitalism and of
imperialism are no different than when Lenin wrote; Lenin&#8217;s main
warning to the Russian workers was that it would not be possible to
solve the problems of the Russian, or for that matter of any other of
the world&#8217;s peoples, on a national scale. In this he was only
echoing the idea of Marx that socialism by its very nature had to be
an international system.
</p>
<p>
Marxism
has always taught its exponents to look beneath the surface of
arguments to see the real material interests, reflected in many cases
quite unconsciously by the exponents of ideas. When Macmillan and
Eisenhower prate about the defence of democracy and freedom, what
they really mean is the defence of rent, interest and profit.
Similarly when the leaders of Stalinist Russia talk about the defence
of the working class and of socialism they really mean the defence of
the interests of the hordes of officials who have usurped power from
the workers. The national ideology of this caste has been summed up
in the &#8220;theory&#8221; of socialism in one country. This theory was
dictated by the interests of the ruling caste in Russia, which wished
to enjoy the fruits of the revolution, at the expense of the workers,
while conciliating the capitalists outside Russia, with the
development of the power and privileges of the bureaucracy in Russia
they were actively opposed to the development of the socialist
revolution in Eastern Europe for fear of the example which this would
provide to the Russian workers leading to their overthrow and the
loss of their position of privilege and dominance.
</p>
<p>
It had
disastrous consequences for the workers of Russia and of the world.
The idea of building a Chinese wall between Russia and the West ended
in the flames and destruction of the Second World War &#160; it was
touch and go whether Russian state ownership of the means of
production would be destroyed by the Nazi hordes.
</p>
<p>
The second
element in the disagreement between the Chinese and the Russian
Stalinists has been over the attitude towards the national liberation
struggle. The Russian bureaucracy has been competing with the great
capitalist powers for the favours of the capitalist, feudal and
tribal chiefs in the underdeveloped countries of Asia and Africa.
There has been no support for any independent movement of the masses
which might take a socialist turn, for fear of antagonising the
capitalist great powers, with all the consequences which might flow
from this.
</p>
<p>
Such
policies in the past have always ended in catastrophe and the victory
of reaction. It will be impossible in the next decade or two to
maintain the <em>status quo</em>.
The class struggle will break through all the restraints which the
leaders of the Labour Party and the Communist Party try to impose on
it. The present boom will not last indefinitely. The capitalists will
turn to other methods, when they can no longer give concessions to
the workers. Either the workers will destroy capitalism or the
capitalists will turn to reaction as they did in the years between
the wars. The victory of reaction, if it is not destroyed by the
working class, would in its turn prepare the way for a new and
perhaps final holocaust of mankind in a new war.
</p>
<p>
All the
brilliant achievements, all the painful sacrifices of two generations
of Russian workers and peasants would have then been in vain. No
matter how great the advances in industry, technique and culture in
Russia during the next 10 or 20 years, it cannot solve the problems
of the Russian and world working class. The policy which led to the
victory of Hitler, in its turn resulted in the work of two decades in
Russia being reduced to ashes. Now the stake is far greater than
that. In the epoch of the H-Bomb and other dreaded means of
destruction, world war would mean the common ruin of all the peoples
of the world &#160; unimaginable slaughter and at the least the
destruction of civilisation and of the culture built by mankind over
thousands of years.
</p>
<p>
What then
is the future? The fate of mankind in the next epoch will be decided
by the fate of the struggle of the working class &#160; above all in
Western Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union and Japan. The
fundamental reason for peace, however unstable it might be at the
present time is the <em>class relation of forces</em>
and the strength of the working class, in the main capitalist
countries. It is this which has stayed the hands of the imperialists.
It is this which is the main force for peace. But by its very nature
such a relation of forces cannot be maintained as it is forever. The
capitalists are satisfied so long as they can continue to make
fabulous profits to give secondary concessions, in living standards
and increased rights, to the working class. But when the economic
situation changes for the worse, as it inevitably will, the
capitalists just as ruthlessly as in the past, will turn to other
methods to defend their privileges and profits. If the workers do not
take power in the West the capitalists will destroy their
organisations, parties, trade unions and rights. The warning of the
mild form of Gaullist reaction in France at a time of difficulties
for French capitalism, is an indication of how easily the basic
ruling stratum of capitalism can change its new methods of rule when
they consider it necessary. The victory of new Hitlers would then
make world war inevitable. Even the old capitalist fox Churchill
understood that it would require such a regime as Hitler&#8217;s to wage
world war under the conditions of today.
</p>
<p>
Far more
than in the days of Lenin and Marx the fate of the world working
class transcends national boundaries. <em>Socialism
is international or it is nothing</em>. The
Russian bureaucracy fears the victory of socialism, in a democratic
form in the West, because their days of rule would then be numbered.
That is why they were so frightened by the Hungarian revolution and
its effect on the Russian and world working class. It is this which
explains their policy. It does not differ in fundamentals from the
policy of Stalin in the thirties. If it depends on the bureaucracy
this policy would mean the death of the working class &#160; indeed
of all humanity.
</p>
<p>
On the
other hand the policies and methods, the ideas of the Chinese
Stalinists ore not fundamentally different to those of the Russian
Stalinists. They have not criticised the Russian policies in order to
put forward a policy of international socialism, and class struggle
which is the only alternative. They have not put forward a policy of
winning over the working class of other countries, while putting
forward penetrating criticisms of the policy of the imperialists. The
real reasons for their dissatisfaction at Russian policies, lies in
the fact that they fear that the Russians are quite prepared to come
to some sort of agreement with the imperialists, especially the
American imperialists, without taking into account the interests and
aspirations of the Chinese bureaucracy. Like the Russian bureaucracy
they are principally interested in the privileges, power, income and
prestige of their own ruling clique. They are national Chinese
Stalinists, and they look at world events from this point of view.
They wish to regain Formosa [Taiwan], the Chinese seat at the United
Nations, and the recognition of the interests of the Chinese state.
They are afraid that these objectives will be sacrificed by the
Russian Stalinists in their endeavours to arrive at some sort of
compromise and agreement with the imperialists of the West,
especially the American imperialists.
</p>
<p>
In
Cambodia, Afghanistan, the Yemen, they have made pacts and agreements
with the reactionary feudal or pre-feudal ruling class on the same
lines as the Russian have made with different capitalist countries.
Their support of the Algerian revolution has been equivocal, and
determined by their foreign diplomacy.
</p>
<p>
They have
in no wise criticised the reactionary and undemocratic control of the
Russian Stalinists, and their dictatorial rule over the Russian
workers. How can they? Their own rule is at an even more dictatorial
phase than the system in Russia, due to the greater backwardness of
China.
</p>
<p>
For
socialists the problem is to look underneath the words and see what
interest or pressures are reflected in the policies of all classes,
castes and groups in society. Any policies of the capitalist parties
are in the last extreme dictated by the needs, interests and outlook
of the capitalists. They cannot be in the interests of the workers.
On the other side the history of the last 30 years has demonstrated
that the policies of the Stalinist parties are dictated by the needs
of the diplomacy of the Stalinist states. This in its turn is
dictated by the needs, interests and outlook of the Stalinist
bureaucracy, in the countries where they hold control.
</p>
<p>
It is true
that there are tremendous internal pressures in Russian society which
are forcing the bureaucracy to make concessions to the workers. They
are demanding a share in the colossally increased production, which
their sacrifice and toil over decades has made possible. Under those
conditions the Russian leaders are genuinely interested in trying to
get some measure of disarmament. Any resources saved from useless
arms can be immediately used for productive purposes due to the
advantages of a system where private ownership has been abolished.
</p>
<p>
On the
other hand there are tremendous internal pressures in China, the
tremendous burdens of the industrialisation programme can only be
justified in the absence of an international socialist perspective
and policy, by constantly emphasising the danger from the external
enemy &#160; imperialism. That is another factor in the policy of the
Chinese Stalinists. But the main reason has been the demand that
China be accorded equal status with the Soviet Union in any
negotiations with the West so that her interests may be safeguarded.
If tomorrow, and in the next period it seems inevitable, American
imperialism tries to come to some sort of agreement with the Chinese
bureaucracy, they would immediately alter their policy. It would
become a replica of the policy of the Russian Stalinists.
</p>
<p>
One of the
reasons for the continuous attack on the United States imperialists,
and imperialism generally, is to try and justify the lack of workers&#8217;
democracy and workers&#8217; rights in China, by pointing to the external
enemy. So it has been with the policy of the Russian Stalinists.
</p>
<p>
In this
connection workers in the left of the labour movement must criticise
the attitude taken up by the <em>Tribune</em>
and the <em>New Statesmen</em>.
The <em>Tribune</em> supports
the attitude of the Russian Stalinists on the question of
coexistence. As if any agreements reached between the capitalist
powers themselves, let alone with fundamentally opposing social
systems, were worth more than the paper on which they were written!
The long and bloody history of capitalism is the grim proof of this.
</p>
<p>
There is
only one force which can be interested in peace, truth and fraternal
relations between the nations, and that is the intentional working
class. Their interests are the same. The hard facts of the class
struggle and of international politics demonstrate that in the long
run there is only one road to peace and plenty: the overthrow of
capitalism and Stalinism and the organisation of a democratic
socialist Britain, in a democratic socialist world.
