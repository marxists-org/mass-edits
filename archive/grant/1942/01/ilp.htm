<p class="fst">Below we publish the letters exchanged between the I.L.P. and ourselves on the 

question of a united front against Stalinist provocation and slander. These 

letters were exchanged following on a discussion between Comrades Atkinson and 

Brockway.</p>

<p>The leaders of the I.L.P. do not believe it necessary to hold &#8220;special&#8221; meetings 

to combat the Stalinist campaign; that such meetings would assist rather than 

deter the Stalinists in their provocations. At the same time they refer to the 

fate which befell their brother party &#8212; the P.O.U.M. &#8212; in Spain! But it is 

precisely because the P.O.U.M. carried out the same ostrich policy as is now 

being carried out by the I.L.P. that attacks were facilitated against it, 

culminating in the murder of its leaders by the Stalinists.</p>

<p>Already the campaign has reached the stage of physical assault, not only of 

the Trotskyists, but of workers selling the <i>New Leader </i>at Communist Party 

meetings. <i>And the campaign is still in its early stages.</i> As the war 

proceeds and the workers turn towards the left, the Stalinists will, in 

desperation turn to more violent methods. Under these circumstances it is an 

elementary precaution of self-preservation that a vigorous campaign of exposure 

be waged against these degrading methods of organised hooliganism.</p>

<p>The Central Committee of the Communist Party have issued instructions that 

the names and addresses of all Trotskyists should be secured. This undoubtedly 

applies to members of the I.L.P. as well. In Spain and in France this action was a 

prelude to Stalinist assistance to police reaction. In the Nazi occupied 

countries the names and addresses of revolutionaries opposed to CP policy were 

handed over to the Gestapo.</p>

<p>This is not a question of a merely incidental character. It concerns the <i>

very existence of workers&#8217; organisations</i> which operate a policy opposed to 

Churchill and the Communist Party. If the I.L.P. refuses to carry the struggle 

against the Stalinist pogroms, how will they face up to the far stronger blows 

of the capitalists when they really start to suppress the left wing, 

particularly since they will have the active assistance of the Stalinists?</p>

<p>Comrades of the I.L.P! Remember the fate of the workers in Spain! We appeal to 

the leadership of the I.L.P. to reverse its present disastrously negative policy 

and enter a united front.</p>

<p>We appeal to the members of the I.L.P. to force their leadership to change its 

present policy and conduct a vigorous united front campaign which will expose 

the Stalinists before the whole Labour movement, as well as protect our 

organisations from their gangster assaults.</p>

	<p class="quoteb">Secretary,</p>

	<p class="quoteb">I.L.P.</p>

	<p class="quoteb">Dear Comrade,</p>



<p class="quoteb">Following the recent attacks on the <i>Socialist Appeal</i> by the <i>Sunday 

Dispatch</i> and the Communist Party, we have issued a challenge to the latter 

to an open debate in order, to substantiate their accusations. In confirmation 

of our verbal request, through Comrade Harold Atkinson, we again ask that you 

delegate a speaker to this meeting in order to put the case of the I.L.P. which is 

also being attacked by the Communist Party.</p>

<p class="quoteb">We believe that this method of thrashing out differences between sections of 

the organised working class complies with the best traditions of the British 

Labour movement. We would be grateful if you will publish our letter to the 

Communist Party in the <i>New Leader</i>.</p>



	<p class="quotec">Yours fraternally,</p>

<p class="quoteb">8<sup>th</sup> December 1941</p>

<p class="quoteb">Mr. Atkinson,</p>

<p class="quoteb">61, Northdown Street,</p>
<p class="quoteb">London, N.1.</p>



<p class="quoteb">Dear Comrade Atkinson,</p>

<p class="quoteb">I promised to let you have a note about the decision against my coming to 

your meeting on December 21<sup>st</sup>.</p>

<p class="quoteb">We are well aware that the Communist Party will adopt any tactics against 

ourselves, as well as against you, including demands as the situation develops 

for the suppression of our paper and of all our activities. Already they are 

beginning tactics here which are similar to those they adopted against the 

P.O.U.M. in Spain.</p>

<p class="quoteb">We take the view, however, that if we hold or participate in special meetings 

dealing with this matter, it will assist rather than deter their purpose. We 

shall meet vigorously their tactics, as we are now doing in the bye-election at 

Central Edinburgh, but to over-emphasise the importance of their attack will 

only play into their own hands.</p>

<p class="quoteb">It was for this reason that we felt it inadvisable that we should accept your 

invitation to send a speaker to your meeting.</p>



	<p class="quotec">Fraternally yours,</p>

	<p class="quotec">Fenner Brockway.</p>
