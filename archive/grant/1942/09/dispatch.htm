<hr /><p class="information"><span class="info">Written:</span> September 1942<br />  <span class="info">Source:</span> <em>Socialist Appeal</em>, vol. 4 no. 12 (September 1942)<br />  <span class="info">Transcription:</span> Francesco 2008<br />  <span class="info">Markup:</span> Manuel 2008</span></p><hr /><p class="fst">The <em>Sunday Dispatch</em> is continuing its slander campaign against the <em>Socialist Appeal</em>. Under the title &ldquo;<em>Socialist Appeal</em> still at it&rdquo; the storyis revealed of how &ldquo;directives&rdquo; from Germany are transmitted to theBritish Trotskyists through a &ldquo;workers&rsquo; challenge&rdquo; station.</p><p>If this were true,surely the <em>Sunday Dispatch</em>'s diplomaticcorrespondent, the author of the article, would have supplied more details,such as the time and the date. Surely he would have notified the police, andformal charges would have been made against the Trotskyists.</p><p>But the pro-fascist <em>Sunday Dispatch</em> does not pursue thepolicy of truth. Taking a leaf out of the book of their mentor Hitler, theybase themselves on the axiom: the bigger the lie, the more easily it will bebelieved.</p><p>The whole style, thewhole method of presentation, the falsifications and the distortions, theamalgam dishonestly linking the policies of the I.L.P. with that of theTrotskyists, all these savour of the familiar methods of Stalinism. Unable toattack the real ideas of Trotskyism, the Communist Party and its new-foundally, the <em>Sunday Dispatch</em>, attempt tothrow dust in the eyes of the workers by confusing the policies of twodifferent working class parties, and link us both up with Hitler. It is clearthat the article is written by an ardent supporter of the Communist Party.</p><p>Indeed it could havebeen written with the pen of W. Wainwright himself, the author of &ldquo;Clear OutHitler&rsquo;s Agents&rdquo;.</p><h4>Trotsky alone warned the workers</h4><p class="fst">The entire article isbased on falsification and slander. Our political position has been and isopenly proclaimed in the pages of the <em>SocialistAppeal</em>.</p><p>The charge that we wouldseek a compromise peace with Hitler is reduced to a despicable lie upon onereading of any issue of the <em>SocialistAppeal</em>. We alone in the labour movement warned of the disastrous outcome ofHitler&rsquo;s coming to power. Trotsky alone, advocated the policy which would haveprevented Hitler&rsquo;s rise, the policy of the united front of all working classorganisations which was attacked by Stalin in the following terms:</p><p class="quoteb">&ldquo;It is significant, that Trotsky has come out indefence of a united front between the communist and social democratic partiesagainst fascism. No more disruptive and counter-revolutionary class lead couldpossibly have been given at a time like the present.&rdquo; (<em>Daily Worker</em>, May 26<sup>th</sup>, 1932.)</p><h4>The amalgam between the I.L.P. and the Trotskyists</h4><p class="fst">Both the <em>Sunday Dispatch</em> and the Communist Partyattempt to depict the resolution of the Glasgow I.L.P. which voted against thesupply of arms for the U.S.S.R., as a Trotskyist resolution.</p><p>This is somewhat stupidwhen Point 1 in our programme of demands is &ldquo;the immediate despatch of arms andmaterial to the Soviet Union under the controlof the Trade Unions and Factory Committees.&rdquo; In any case, the defeating of thisresolution arises, not from any lack of desire on the part of the I.L.P. toassist the U.S.S.R., but from the sectarian attitude on their part, for whichthe Trotskyists have always criticised them. In the July issue of the <em>Socialist Appeal</em>, Marc Loris writes onthis point:</p><p class="quoteb">&ldquo;At the I.L.P. National Conference an amendment waspresented asking for the &lsquo;advocacy of the production and transport of warmaterials to the Soviet Union under workers&rsquo;control.&rsquo; The idea of tying the defence of the SovietUnion to the class struggle of the English workers is excellent.The slogan has an offensive character as much against the English bourgeoisieas against its agents, the Labourite and Stalinist leaders. But the leadershipof the I.L.P. hastened to oppose this proposition. The arguments of itsspokesmen were, taken as a whole, that the proposals are impracticable. Thusthe I.L.P. leaders reveal once more their total incomprehension of the dynamicsof revolutionary action. How render &lsquo;practicable&rsquo; tomorrow that which is&lsquo;[im]practicable&rsquo; today?&rdquo;</p><p class="quoteb">&ldquo;They have no idea. They find it very &lsquo;practicable&rsquo;to praise the &lsquo;statesmanship&rsquo; of Stalin, to insult Lenin by attendingfraudulent ceremonies; but to call on the English workers to demand anaccounting from the capitalists on aid to the Soviet Union,that is &lsquo;impracticable&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p><p class="fst">On the question ofMcGovern&rsquo;s attitude towards Munich,which the <em>Sunday Dispatch</em>triumphantly uses, and which the Communist Party never fails to use, theTrotskyists have always criticised the I.L.P. on this question. It is one ofthe points which separates us. This position springs from the pacifist andcentrist position of the I.L.P. <em>But atany rate, we stand, whole-heartedly with the I.L.P. against the foul allegationthat this springs from the desire to help Hitler or Fascism</em>. The accusationis one that only the pen prostitutes of the pro-Fascist <em>Sunday Dispatch</em> or the Communist Party falsifiers would dare tomake.</p><p>The ignorant referenceof the I.L.P. defending the &ldquo;Trotskyist&rdquo; P.O.U.M. in Spain is typical. The P.O.U.M. wasnever Trotskyist as they claim, but precisely the Spanish version of the I.L.P.So it is natural that the I.L.P. should defend its policies. We on the otherhand consistently criticised the policies of the P.O.U.M. for its participationin the Popular Front Government which lead the Spanish workers to their defeat.</p><h4><em>Dispatch</em> praisedfascism in all countries</h4><p class="fst">In their frantic effortsto besmirch the revolutionaries, the Stalinists are willing to use any methodsand any pro-fascist people or paper to suit their ends. And what is the recordof these new found friends and comrades-in-lies? These people who now accusethe Trotskyists and the I.L.P. of assisting fascism, are the very ones who haveconsistently supported fascism and reaction throughout the world. The questionof Munichism is one on which they should keep silent. It was the <em>Sunday Dispatch</em> more than any otherpaper, which supported Chamberlain at that time. <em>And precisely because they wished to help Hitler</em>. They openly saidso! The reference to Spainis even more injudicious. When the P.O.U.M. was fighting on the barricadesagainst Franco, they supported this butcher as the saviour of Christianity andcivilisation! Their tender regard for the Soviet Union which they now manifest,is shown for the hypocrisy that it is by the fact that they incited the Britishgovernment to allow a free hand to Germany in the East.</p><p>In one of the manyarticles which they published by Sir Oswald Mosley on their ideal of a fascistEurope of the future, he openly called for Germanyto be allowed to attack the Soviet Union. Britain would gain the advantage from this bythe mutual exhaustion of both Germanyand the Soviet Union. This is, in fact, thesecret policy of the <em>Sunday Dispatch</em>and its backers today.</p><p>While therevolutionaries were waging a struggle against fascism in all countries of theworld, what was the attitude of the new knight errant of the holy struggleagainst fascism?</p><p>While the brown murder,bands were murdering the worker-militants (including the Trotskyists) anddestroying the trade unions with terror and torture in the first moments offascism in Germany,here are some samples of what the <em>SundayDispatch</em> was saying. In October of 1933, Geoffrey Harmsworth wrote:</p><p class="quoteb">&ldquo;&hellip;The passionate sincerity of Hitler cried aloud.This was no cheap tub-thumping political firebrand but a fervent patriot and arealist. It is monstrously untrue to say that the Storm Troops and Brown Shirtsare a new German army in disguise. Germany does not want another war.&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p class="fst">Inan article of October 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1933 by Colonel T. C. R. Moore, M.P., wewere told by the <em>Sunday Dispatch</em>:</p><p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Germanywelcomed her saviour, and largely owing to the obviously sincere andsingle-minded appeal of his policy he is today the adored leader of certainly90 per cent of the German population. Eight months ago Herr Hitler becameChancellor of the Reich. Today, and I now speak of experience barely a weekold, the whole atmosphere of Germanyhas changed. Sobriety has replaced licence, patriotism has usurped Communism,virtue has abolished vice.&rdquo;</p><p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The servants of the law have crushed the masters ofthe gun. Women and children are safe; animals are mercifully treated; socialservices have received a new impetus&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p class="fst">This is how the <em>Sunday Dispatch</em> smoothed over andjustified the horrible atrocities of the Nazis. The article continues:</p><p class="quoteb">&ldquo;These are some of the changes I have seen, but Irealise that in making these changes there has been unjustified persecution,misery and suffering caused to many innocent German nationals of varied creedand faith. But experience has taught us to be tolerant of the ways ofrevolution. Eggs must be broken to make an omelette. Suffering is inevitable inthe reconstruction of a State.&rdquo;</p><p class="quoteb">&ldquo;But if I may judge from my personal knowledge ofHerr Hitler, peace and justice are the keywords of his, policy, and given time,the support of his people, and the goodwill of his colleagues, he will carrythat policy to success.&rdquo;</p><p class="fst">On December 31<sup>st</sup>,1933, the <em>Dispatch</em> published aspecial feature article by Mussolini, &ldquo;The Whole World Going Fascist?&rdquo; To comecloser home it was the <em>Dispatch</em> andthe <em>Daily Mail</em> which were among theprincipal backers of Mosley and his black-shirt thugs in their attempt toorganise fascism in Britain.Their pages were opened to Mosley and they gave him every possible publicity.On January 21<sup>st</sup>, 1934, on a special page was a picture of Mosley anda signed article by him entitled: &ldquo;Why We Wear The Black Shirt&rdquo;:</p><p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The Blackshirts have faced and overcome theSocialist bullies of the razor, the knife, and the broken bottle, by standingtogether and fighting in the ordered ranks which the Blackshirt makes possible.Englandalready has to thank them for breaking the Red Terror of the streets, althoughgreater ordeals may yet await them.&rdquo;</p><p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Thus we wear the Blackshirt for that combinationof ideal and practical reasons which is so characteristic of the faith offascism.&rdquo;</p><p class="fst">An ecstatic editorial ofthe same date was entitled, &ldquo;The Blackshirts are coming.&rdquo;</p><p>Thus they supported thepaid thugs and hooligans in the ranks of Mosley's bands in their efforts tocreate an organisation to destroy the workers' movement and rights in Britain. OnJanuary 28<sup>th</sup>, 1934, they wrote this description of Mosley:</p><p class="quoteb">&ldquo;To the world Sir Oswald Mosley; to Blackshirts, theLeader.&rdquo;</p><p class="quoteb">&ldquo;He quests for a better, healthier, happier England like aKing Arthur Knight for the Holy Grail.&ldquo;</p><p class="fst">On May 21<sup>st</sup>1934, this rag proudly announced that:</p><p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The editor has purchased a limited number of seatsto be presented to <em>Sunday Dispatch</em>readers for Mosley's Olympia Meeting.&rdquo;</p><p class="fst">On the brutal thuggeryat the fascist meeting in Olympia,which provoked an outcry in nearly the whole of the British press, the <em>Dispatch</em> headlined an article by G. WardPrice, friend of Hitler: &ldquo;No Communist Badly Injured. But Blackshirts still inHospital. Elaborate &lsquo;Red&rsquo; Plot Miscarries. Armed Interrupters Wreck Meeting.&rdquo;</p><p>Their leader of June 17<sup>th</sup>,1934, was headed &ldquo;Mussolini-Hitler Talks-Hopes For Peace&rdquo; in which they say ofthese fascist gangsters:</p><p class="quoteb">&ldquo;However that may be they have this in common. Thateach is the beloved leader of a great nation that regards him as its saviourand to which his lightest word is almost a divine command.&rdquo;</p><p class="fst">Their support of theJapanese militarists, of Hitler, of Mussolini was continued right up to theoutbreak of the war. Now these gentlemen, aided, abetted and supported by theCommunist Party, have the audacity to slander the International Socialists.Tomorrow they would favour a deal with Hitler, Mussolini and Franco, if itsuited the interests of their masters, the capitalist class. If the capitalistswere threatened by the working class they would be the first to appeal toHitler for help, just as their equivalents did in France. From this yellow rag theworkers expect nothing different. But that the so-called Communist Party shouldassist and aid reaction by the peddling of slanders against therevolutionaries, is a danger and a warning to the workers. They have linkedthemselves up with the most reactionary and pro-fascist section of the rulingclass in this country, and the most foul anti-working class section of thecapitalist press.</p><p>In the eyes of allhonest workers the role of the Communist Party is becoming clear. It isbecoming clear too, that the reason the Communist Party and the <em>Sunday Dispatch</em> attack us is not at allthat they think we are &ldquo;pro-fascist&rdquo;; <em>itis our programme they fear</em>. Despite the smallness of our numbers atpresent, they know that ours is the only programme which represents theinterests of the working class; the programme of working class struggle againstfascism at home and abroad; the programme which will lead to Socialism.</p><p> In the teeth of the barrage of lies and slanders we are unafraid. We base   ourselves on truth and honesty. We base ourselves on the interests of the working   class. No matter the obstacles placed in our path, our programme will find the   road to the workers, and the workers will find the road to our programme. </p><center>	<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px; padding: 10px; width: 500px">		<h4>&pound;10 Reward</h4>		<p class="fst">To any member of the Communist Party who can prove that the so-called quotations 		  from Trotskyist publications in their pamphlet &#8220;Clear Out Hitler&#8217;s 		  Agents&#8221; are not forgeries.</p>		<p><center>&#8212;Or&#8212;</center></p>		<p class="fst">To any member of the C.P. who can show one page of this pamphlet which does 		  not contain a minimum of five lies.<p><div align="right"><em>Socialist Appeal</em></div></p>	</div>
