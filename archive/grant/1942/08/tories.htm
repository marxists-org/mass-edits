<p class="fst">The attack on the <i>Socialist Appeal</i> last month by the entire national 
and provincial press, the right wing Tories, the Communist Party, the Liberals, 
the miners&#8217; misleaders&mdash;was launched with one object&mdash;to get the <i>Socialist 
Appeal</i> suppressed.</p>
<p>So farcical were the charges, so irresponsible were the allegations of the 
miners&#8217; officials that the campaign collapsed&mdash;for the moment. But this is by 
no means the end of the matter. It serves as a warning of the most serious 
nature to the entire working class. </p>
<p>For it was not merely the <i>Socialist Appeal</i> that was under fire: it was 
the struggle of the miners for the betterment of their lot; it was the right of 
the working class to organise independently, to seek its own solution to the 
tremendous problems of today; to fight for power. This is what was being 
attacked. The <i>Socialist Appeal </i>bore the brunt, because through it is 
expressed the true aspirations of the workers; through it is offered the road of 
independence and hope for the workers&mdash;and doom for the capitalist class&hellip;</p>
<p>The campaign in the Press went hand-in-hand with the campaign in Parliament. 
The right wing Tories advanced to the attack from every possible angle: paper 
supplies, personnel, internment under 18b, and suppression of the paper. These 
reactionaries, who stand for the method of force and suppression against the 
working class at the present time, gladly seized the opportunity of attacking 
the most conscious representatives of the working class. They are longing for 
the time when they will be able to use the methods of fascism in Britain. Today 
it is the Trotskyists, tomorrow it could be the I.L.P., and finally they would be 
after the scalps of Morrison, Bevin and the Labour leaders themselves. But at 
the moment they would have it seem that in this attack on the <i>Socialist 
Appeal</i>, these ultra-reactionaries were motivated solely by their 
disinterested love for the labour movement and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>This newfound love for the organisations of the workers and the Soviet Union 
ill-befits them. The impudence of these people posing as friends of the Soviet 
Union against us, when it was but yesterday that they were preparing for war 
against Russia at the time of the Finnish events, and who have always fought and 
conspired against the Soviet Union and the labour movement, while we have 
consistently fought and defended the Soviet Union and the labour movement 
against all attacks. All this is typical of the brazen hypocrisy of the ruling 
class.</p>
<p>The attitude of the Press and of the reactionary M.P.s is a commentary on the 
situation in &#8220;democratic&#8221; Britain today. What capitalist paper or political 
party would have questions of this character asked about their reporters, paper 
supplies etc? The pro-Nazi <i>Daily Mail</i> for instance? It is taken for 
granted that the capitalist press and organisations should have the right to 
conduct its normal functions without interference by the state. But when it 
comes to a Socialist newspaper, in which the downtrodden and oppressed find a 
voice, then no inquisition or persecution is too severe.</p>
<p>The paper which carried out the most determined and persistent campaign was 
the mouthpiece of the coal-owners, the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. Dismissing Hall&#8217;s 
allegations from the outset, the <i>Telegraph</i> conducted a campaign day after 
day because they are only too well aware of the real situation in the coalfields 
and the fact that the <i>Socialist Appeal</i> voices the true aspirations of the 
miners.</p>
<p>They based their campaign for our suppression on a sober estimation of our 
programme, printing sections of this programme in order to illustrate its 
dangers to their class. Their industrial correspondent underlined this in his 
remarks while interviewing us: &#8220;This paper is dynamite! Even the <i>Daily Worker</i> 
in its militant days didn&#8217;t touch your programme!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at first sight it might seem astonishing that such a fearful 
assault should be waged on a small organisation and its Press. The daily 
newspapers mentioned, possess between them a circulation in a single day more 
than what the <i>Appeal</i> possesses in a year. Yet they are afraid! This 
arises out of the uneasiness of the ruling class at the present time. The masses 
of workers are dissatisfied with the existing state of affairs. The most 
reactionary sections of the ruling class are already thinking in terms of 
suppression and dictatorship as a means of keeping the workers in check. The 
workers are beginning to realise the shameless profiteering of the capitalists 
and the mockery of equality of sacrifice. That is why they want to silence those 
who consistently and untiringly fight for the interests of the workers. It is 
not our number today, but the fact that our programme will become the programme 
of the masses tomorrow, which has driven the most reactionary sections of the 
ruling class to take the offensive against us.</p>
<p>But the question can be asked: why should the miners&#8217; leaders appeal to the 
Tories for aid? Apart from the irresponsible Mr. Hall, there is Mr. Will Lawther, 
the President of the Miners&#8217; Federation of Great Britain. It was they who raised 
the question first, and provided the right wing Tories and the coal-owners with 
the opportunity of launching an offensive against the workers&#8217; press. The reason 
is that these &#8220;leaders&#8221; would resort to any vile means to defend their 
bureaucratic domination of the union and the privileges which flow from them.</p>
<p>The reasons for the monstrous slanders on the part of these union leaders, 
arises out of the fact that they have lost the confidence of the miners in their 
leadership. Their shameless stand on the side of the coal-owners in recent 
strikes, has led to disgust and disillusionment among the rank and file. The 
miners are beginning to see that such rotten leadership can only lead to 
capitulation to the coal-owners. The Trotskyists have been putting forward among 
the miners and other workers, the necessity of turning the unions into fighting 
organs really representative of the workers and to replace the present 
leadership by more militant ones. Now at the first signs of a threat developing 
to their positions, these leaders run whining to their masters for help, not 
scrupling to use such dirty weapons as the slander of pro-Nazism.</p>
<p>The most encouraging feature of this attack, and one that bodes well for the 
future of Socialism in Britain, is that while the coal-owners, the capitalist 
press, the right wing Tories, the miners&#8217; leaders and the Stalinists united for 
a unanimous assault on the <i>Socialist Appeal</i>, we had the sympathy and 
support of the broad masses of the working class. The readers and supporters of 
the <i>Socialist Appeal</i> were angered and indignant at this vile attack. Not 
a single one faltered in support of their paper. Not only those who had read the
<i>Appeal</i> in the past, but thousands of new sympathisers were gained. Dozens 
of letters were received from miners, soldiers, engineers and other workers, 
with whom we had never been in touch before, enquiring about our paper and 
organisation. Far from weakening, the attack strengthened us in the eyes of the 
working class.</p>
<p>The Government has refused to suppress the <i>Socialist Appeal</i> at the 
present stage, on the grounds of our weakness. There is apparently no question 
of democracy and the freedom of the press involved! It is purely an estimate of 
strength and potentialities. When we gain the ear of tens of thousands of 
workers, then apparently all democracy will go by the board. So we see the 
ruling class is prepared to tolerate opposition, only so long as that opposition 
is not effective. The moment the working class evinces a desire for change, at 
that moment all rights of free speech and free press are cast aside and the 
rulers resort to methods of suppression, and ultimately to fascism. The only 
road to defeat Fascism, both at home and abroad, lies in defending the rights 
and interests of the workers wherever they are menaced, and in marching ahead to 
the establishment of workers&#8217; power and socialism. That is the programme of the
<i>Socialist Appeal</i>.</p>
<p>Workers! Trade Unionists! Miners! Readers of the <i>Socialist Appeal</i>! It 
is your paper that is under attack! It is you and, your rights they are 
attacking! And it is in your hands that the real defence of the <i>Socialist 
Appeal</i> lies.</p>
<p>This is but a dress rehearsal. Tomorrow the working class will be faced with 
even more powerful attacks, as the situation in Britain grows ever more tense. 
In the struggle, the workers need a fighting paper and a fighting leadership. 
Let your answer to the attacks on the <i>Socialist Appeal</i> be that you 
resolve to give it even greater support than in the past.</p>
<p>Join the ranks of the Workers&#8217; International League and help us to build a 
party that will make the programme of the <i>Socialist Appeal</i> a living 
reality.</p>
