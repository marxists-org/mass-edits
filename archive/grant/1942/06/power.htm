        Pre-Conference of Workers' International League, August 22 and 23, 1942,
        and revised for publication.</p>

   
<h4>Tasks &amp; Perspectives</h4>

<p>The whole world is now involved in the agonies of the
imperialist conflagration. The few remaining 'neutrals' are neutral in name
only. They have been compelled to restrict consumption of the very essentials of
life just in the same way as the actual belligerents - and sometimes to an even
greater extent. Besides this, most of them are turning out armaments to the peak
of their capacity for one or another of the great powers - with all that this
implies. Few of them will avoid the actual shedding of blood. Ireland, Spain,
Portugal, Turkey, and even Vichy France<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup>
will all be involved in the war in one way or another.</p>

<p>The Fourth International predicted long in advance that
wherever the war started, it would inevitably and very rapidly, envelop the
whole world. Everything had pointed to this: the contradictions of capitalism
which the growth of the productive forces had intensified and aggravated; the
sharpening imperialist antagonisms throughout the world; the incapacity of the
leadership of the Second and Third Internationals to solve these contradictions.
Between the first and second world imperialist wars, terrible national and
social antagonisms were engendered and aggravated. With the failure of the
workers' leadership to take power out of the hands of the bourgeoisie, these led
inevitably to world war.</p>

<p>But the developments which have given the war its universality
have at the same time, far from strengthening imperialism, weakened it in the
extreme. The very contradictions which led the imperialists to seek a way out in
war will lead directly to revolutions. It is no longer a question of attempting
to estimate where the weak link in the chain of capitalism might be. There are
no strong links. There is not a single country, not even mighty America, which
has the possibility of escaping terrific social convulsions and even civil war.
Just as no one could state for certain where the war would begin, so it is with
the social revolution. It may be Japan, China, Germany, the continent of Europe,
Britain, or perhaps a colonial revolt in Africa. But just as the war had to
spread inevitably throughout the world, so will the social revolution spread
from country to country and continent to continent - and at an even greater
speed.</p>


<h4>Britain's Decline as a World Power</h4>

<p>The decline of Britain as the invincible mistress of almost
half the world is best seen in the loss of her position on the seven seas.
Britannia has ceased to rule the waves. America, even before she had fired a
shot in either hemisphere, announced a programme of naval expansion which would
alone assure her unchallengeable superiority in a sphere which Britain has for
centuries considered her own exclusive preserve; and a sphere too, in which the
loss of first position exposes Britain to particular vulnerability in any
conflict with the new master. Britain is thus at the mercy of her transatlantic
'saviour'.</p>

<p>Not only metropolitan Britain, but the empire too is in this
position. Australia has already passed under the direct domination of America.
The Australian Premier has openly proclaimed that they must look to America for
succour. The pooling of the industry of the United States and Canada is but a
pale reflection of the penetration of American finance capital into what is now
but a province of the USA. New Zealand and South Africa, although not so far on
the road, are already travelling in the same direction.</p>

<p>South America, which in the past provided one of the biggest
fields for British investments, has now become an American preserve. In the Far
East, the situation is just as gloomy for the British bourgeoisie. Not only have
Malaya and Burma fallen to the Japanese, but China now looks to America for arms
and subsidies in her war against Japan. And in India, American influence makes
itself felt more and more.</p>

<p>The British bourgeoisie and their man of the hour, Churchill,
are compelled to accept this overlordship of American imperialism. There is
nothing else they can do. Defeat in the present war at the hands of Germany
means the end of imperialist Britain as a power of the first rank. Victory will
mean a less spectacular decline to a second rate position under the patronage of
America. This is the best that the British ruling class can hope for. In reality
the process of decline has been going on for many years before the war. The
altering relationship of forces between the powers was bearing less and less
relationship to Britain's nominal position. The shattering blows of German and
Japanese imperialism have served to reveal the true position and exposed the
senility and decay of British imperialism.</p>

<p>The revelation of this weakness, particularly through the
Japanese advance, to the hundreds of millions of colonial slaves in the British
empire will lead to action on their part on the morrow. The colonial masses are
being stirred by mighty events out of their apathy and indifference. It will be
impossible for the paralytic hand of Whitehall to keep them in continued
enslavement.</p>

<p>In addition, the working class in Britain is becoming more
conscious and critical of the old school tie blimps in the colonial service and
the armed forces, whose stupidity and incompetence is but a reflection of the
fact that the British bourgeois system has completely outlived itself. A
realisation of the enfeeblement and decline of the ruling class is beginning to
crystallise itself in the consciousness of the masses. A mood of criticism on
the basis of the past defeats has penetrated all strata of the population.</p>


<h4>Britain's Internal Situation</h4>

<p>Even before the crisis of world capitalism had resolved itself
into the agony of a protracted death struggle between the imperialist rivals for
world domination, the ruling class had perceived the necessity for a violent
settlement with the British workers. The whole policy of the guiding layer of
the bourgeoisie in the years before the war, was conditioned by a preoccupation
with the problems and tasks of <em>civil war</em>.</p>

<p>While the leadership of the mighty mass organisations - trade
unions, Labour Party, Communist Party, not to speak of the Independent Labour
Party (ILP) - was lulling the masses with the soothing routine of
parliamentarism, the leadership of finance capital, soberly assessing the
situation, was overhauling its plans for an armed struggle with the masses.</p>

<p>In the two years preceding the present war, army manoeuvres
were, for the first time, based on the assumption that civil war was raging in
Britain.</p>

<p>All these plans of the ruling class (utopian in any event
except in the case of the complete paralysis of the leadership of the workers'
vanguard) have been shattered by the course of events. The war has resulted in
the fusion of the army with the working class far more than in any other period
in history. (It may be remarked in passing, that it is in an effort to minimise
or overcome this that the bourgeoisie has spent so much effort in attempting to
incite the soldiers against the workers by demogogically contrasting 'high'
wages of the workers with low rates of pay in the army.)</p>

<p>The almost complete destruction of the European labour
movement in the past eight or nine years has been accompanied by an apparently
inexplicable strengthening of the British labour and trade union bureaucracy.
Alone on the European continent (with the unimportant exceptions of Switzerland
and Sweden, which exist by gracious consent of Hitler) the British labour
organisations remained intact. This is explained by the fact that while her
rivals were preoccupied with internal social conflict or intensive preparations
for the coming war, Britain managed, for the last time perhaps, to increase her
trade to nearly all markets. By these means she was enabled to grant slight
illusory concessions to the working masses. As a result the few years preceding
the war were among the most peaceful in the history of British capitalism. The
class struggle suffered a lull with far fewer and less bitter strikes on the
industrial field. The labour and trade union bureaucracy became more than ever
associated with the interests of the employers as obedient and interested
servants.</p>

<p>Because of the super-exploitation of the colonial masses the
British imperialists were enabled to grant concessions to a privileged stratum
of the British working class, and even to a certain extent, to raise the level
of the whole of the British workers above that of the European workers. Basing
herself on this, Britain's industries became archaic and outdated, instead of
advancing as in Germany and America, on the basis of modern technique.
Hopelessly outmoded from a technical standpoint, she has been fighting on the
shoulders of the colonies. But the war is having its full effect on the British
economy.</p>

<p>In the first nine months of 1941 Britain spent
&pound;3,495,761,703, while her ordinary income during that period was only
&pound;1,221,567,147. Less than a decade ago in 1931, the financial oligarchy
engineered a crisis in order to throw out the Labour government ostensibly
because of its refusal to cut unemployment benefit by 2,000,000 per year.
Today the deficit amounts to more than this sum in a fortnight, and all the
burdens of this are laid on the shoulders of the workers.</p>

<p>In every sphere the ruling class has revealed its complete
senility and incapacity to even conduct its own war. The corruption and
incompetence industrially and militarily, raises sharply in the minds of the
workers <em>the question of the regime. </em>In the factories, chaos, waste and
mismanagement, the incapacity to organise production because of the fetters of
the profit system, assume a particularly baleful character when counterposed to
the ever-increasing exhortations for the workers to 'go to it'. This is
especially so when military defeats are justified by the 'lack of equipment'.
Meanwhile the combines and big monopolies are assuming a stranglehold on the
economic life of the nation. An unbridled clique of monopoly capitalists who
control the banks, armaments manufacture and food combines are drawing greater
dividends today more than ever before. It is not merely the despoliation of the
working class, but the middle class is being completely ruined. The small
shopkeepers and business people, professionals and clerks have been hard hit by
the war.</p>

<p>The decay of the ruling class is so great that big sections
are beginning to lose confidence in themselves. For the moment they have no
substitute for Churchill. The complaints of Conservative members of Parliament
of the inefficiency in industry and the army are but a glimpse of the fissures
and internecine strife which are opening out within the ranks of the ruling
class. And this at a time when the masses are not yet moving into action! All
these symptoms are a reflection of the profound processes taking place within
British society. Deep disillusionment and discontent at the moment find no
outlet, but are simmering deep within the masses. All the conditions for social
explosions are rapidly maturing</p>


<h4>The Possibilities of Fascism in Britain</h4>

<p>The reluctant taking up of arms by British imperialism to
defend her interests, compelled her to base herself on the hatred of the
population for fascism - and even demagogically and confusedly, to intensify
this hatred. Automatically this compelled the ruling class to dispense with its
reserve weapon - the organisation of Mosley<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup>
fascists. Robbed of his basis, like the fascists in occupied Europe, Mosley
logically became an agent for German imperialism - a British Quisling. Under
these circumstances he could not hope to retain what small support he had gained
prior to the war. Fascism finds its mass basis essentially among the petty
bourgeoisie and the most backward strata of the population. British fascism had
not penetrated the decisive sections of the petty bourgeoisie, not to speak of
the backward strata of the working class. Mosley's position was untenable and
the capitalists were compelled to put him in a safe place (comfortably, to be
sure) behind bars as a protection against the working class and a sop to public
opinion. Not to have done so would have led to his being torn to pieces by an
infuriated British working class. His organisation vanished from the scene. It
can be seen therefore, that there can be no question of fascism in Britain in
the period opening up. Mosley could only come to power on the basis of German
bayonets.</p>

<p>The bourgeoisie has no reserve weapons at the present time.
The ruined middle class; the dissatisfied workers; the lack of confidence of the
rulers themselves: all lay the basis, not for a turn in the direction of
fascism, but for the most revolutionary period in British history. The fragile
basis for the rule of the bourgeoisie rests in the failure of the leadership of
the workers to offer an alternative to capitalist rule, which they justify by
the threat from 'foreign fascism'.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the distrust and hostility towards the ruling
class is increasing within all strata of the population. The eyes of the workers
cannot remain closed to the incapacity and corruption of bourgeois rule. It
confronts them in every sphere of their daily lives. This awakening is preparing
for a revolutionary wave of such titanic proportions that even the great
struggles of Spain and France will appear Lilliputian.</p>

<p>Fascism could only arise in the event of the defeat of this
movement resulting from the betrayal of the Labour and Stalinist parties, and if
we do not succeed in gaining the support of the decisive section of the British
workers. On the basis of such a defeat the bourgeoisie would gradually regain
confidence and prepare for its revenge. Basing itself on the despairing middle
class and even backward sections of the workers disappointed in the failure of
the revolutionary wave, the bourgeoisie could, in a short space of time organise
a fascist movement - a 'British Empire Protection Society,' or some such
organisation - and attempt to establish a precarious rule by a bloody and
horrible repression of the working class. Lacking a social base, faced with the
fact that the working class is the decisive section of the population - 75 per
cent - a fascist regime in this country would of necessity be even more ruthless
than Franco's.</p>


<h4>The Role of the Labour Party in British Society</h4>

<p>Immediately after the declaration of the war, the cloven hoof
of the bourgeoisie was revealed. Draconic legislation, which if carried out
would turn Britain into a totalitarian state on the approved model, was placed
on the statute book with the tacit support of the Labour leaders. Nevertheless,
in contradistinction to the 'democratic' ally, France, no immediate attempt was
made to put these laws into effect. The French bourgeoisie was compelled by the
severity of the social crisis and the bitter mood of the workers to carry its
repressive legislation into immediate effect, and, in the last analysis, at the
decisive moment - as a safeguard against their own masses - to surrender to
Hitler.</p>

<p>The same military crisis which resulted in the obliteration of
Blum, Jouhaux<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-3" name="doc-3">(3)</a></sup>
and company in France, placed the Labour leaders in Britain more firmly in
ministerial positions. Much more than in the last war the capitalists lean for
support upon their Labour agents. The course of the struggle on the continent;
the chains which German imperialism has riveted upon the conquered and subject
peoples, enabled the Labour bureaucracy to move confidently and surely to the
path of open surrender to the bourgeoisie. The working class, not without some
murmuring, faced with no alternative that they could see other than nazi
totalitarianism or support for their 'own' government, supported the entry of
the Labour ministers into the government. Thus the worsened international
position and the difficulties of British imperialism strengthened the role of
the Labour bureaucracy in the internal calculations of the bourgeoisie. Morrison
and Bevin have been placed in those posts where the bourgeoisie expected there
would be the most pressure from the masses - Home Security and Labour. Under the
sign-post 'Against Hitlerism' the Labour leaders have called for the utmost
exertion on the part of the workers as exemplified by the 'inspiring' 'GO TO IT'
slogan of Morrison.</p>

<p>In the last war the ministerial coalition of Labour with the
bourgeoisie which commenced in 1915, was ended in 1917 through the pressure of
the disillusioned workers exasperated by the privations at home and the
predatory imperialist policy abroad. A tremendous effect was created by the
Russian Revolution which had immediate repercussions in Britain. The widespread
swing to the left was reflected in the attitude of the Labour leaders, who,
scenting danger, were compelled to put forward pseudo-revolutionary speeches to
maintain their hold on the rank and file.</p>


<p>The revolutionary left, which later crystallised into the
Communist Party of Great Britain, destroyed its chance of winning a mass basis,
precisely because it failed to understand the necessity of keeping in close
touch with the unclear feelings and aspirations of the masses, which in their
beginnings could not but be in the direction of the Labour Party. As Lenin had
occasion to lecture the ultra-lefts: it is very useful to chronicle the crimes
of the Labour bureaucracy but that is not sufficient to win the masses. This was
the key to the weakness of the revolutionary forces in the first years. It is
the key to all the subsequent developments, coupled of course, with the betrayal
of Stalinism.</p>


<p>The experience of the first Labour government once again
demonstrated the strong roots which reformism has within the working class. The
Communist Party, at that time not yet completely degenerated, failed to gain a
mass support, despite the fact that Labour had shown itself utterly incapable of
introducing even one major reform in the interests of the masses. The embittered
toilers turned from the political to the industrial struggle. A revolutionary
radicalisation of the masses began. It reached its culmination and greatest
expression in the general strike of 1926. The trade union wing of the Labour
bureaucracy were compelled by the upward swing to place themselves at the head
of the movement which they hated and dreaded, if that movement was not to get
completely out of their control. In order to cloak their activities they
utilised the Russian trade unions through the Anglo-Russian Committee<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-4" name="doc-4">(4)</a></sup>.
This they were enabled to do because of the policies of Stalin.</p>

<p>The defeat of the general strike, instead of 'finally'
exposing the role of the Labour and trade union leaders to the organised
workers, led to the reinforcement of the Labour bureaucracy. The striving of the
masses found its outlet in the formation of the second Labour government. The
debacle of 1931 soon followed; the leadership revealed its true colours and went
openly over to the camp of the class enemy. Yet, despite this, the masses of
workers, with ranks almost intact, remained under the banner of Labour. Not of
course without inner convulsions; the pressure from within forced a split of the
left-wing - the ILP broke away from the Labour Party.</p>


<h4>The Swing to the Left of the Labour Bureaucracy</h4>

<p>Since the crisis of 1931, even before the outbreak of the war,
the top stratum of the Labour and trade union bureaucracy has completely
degenerated and become more closely integrated with the bourgeois state machine.
Simultaneously, they have taken to the outlook and ideology of the bourgeoisie.
While the capitalists lean more heavily upon this strata, the dialectic of the
process reveals that under the pressure of events a section of the bureaucracy
is becoming completely separated from any mass basis. The deeper this process
evolves, the more will the bourgeoisie find itself leaning on a vacuum. It is
only the temporary inertia and inaction of the workers which enables these
leaders to play their present role. But the reawakening of the masses will
destroy their basis completely. The Labour bureaucracy has always operated the
Labour Party as an electoral machine. It was purely for this purpose that a
certain amount of activity was tolerated. But with the outbreak of the war and
the fusion of the bureaucracy with the bourgeois state, there is no activity for
the Labour Party branches as such. Moreover, the bureaucracy finds any sign of
life within the party irksome, as it can only bring the tops into collision with
the rank and file. On the other hand the trade unions, which have always been
the backbone of the Labour Party, are continuing their existence and becoming
more lively. This is reflected in the move of millions of workers to become
organised.</p>

<p>But the unions too are becoming alienated from the stratum of
the bureaucracy which has entered the government and upon whom the bourgeoisie
lean most heavily, thus forcing them to come into sharp collision with the
workers. This is leading directly and inevitably to a split within the trade
union and Labour bureaucracy. The MacDonald experience<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-5" name="doc-5">(5)</a></sup>
will at a later stage, be enacted once again, but now with different social
implications. This tendency is already visible in the preliminary skirmishes
between Citrine and Bevin<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-6" name="doc-6">(6)</a></sup>
on the one hand, and more glaringly in the development of a left wing within the
Labour Party. Even in the distorted reflection of parliament, the pressure of
the rank and file is evidenced. Aneurin Bevan, Shinwell, Laski, etc, represent
this tendency. The 'revolt' on the issue of conscription of the masses but not
of wealth is a first indication of what is to come. Although the 'lefts' made
haste to come to peace on the welcome pretext given by Japan's entry into the
war, tomorrow the differences within the working class will assume wider and
more bitter proportions.</p>

<p>A split in the Labour Party is inevitable. The thoroughly
rotten and decayed elements of the extreme right wing will step over into the
camp of the ruling class as did MacDonald. The left will be driven to break the
coalition and form an open opposition in Parliament, and what is more, they will
almost certainly gain a majority. In 1931, in spite of the demoralisation among
the masses, only the most degraded and corrupt of the Labour bureaucracy went
openly over to the camp of the class enemy.</p>

<p>Already at the first signs of a critical spirit awakening, the
Labour 'lefts' have been forced into opposition. On the basis of the rising wave
of discontent with potential revolutionary implications, it is inevitable that
the decisive section of the trade union and Labour bureaucrats, including the
majority of the parliamentary representatives, will be forced into an open clash
with the capitalist class and a breaking of the coalition. In words at least,
they will assume an extremely radical attitude. This process will depend to a
large extent on a number of factors; especially the events which take place on
the military fronts. These will have a greater or lesser effect on the
subjective consciousness of the British masses, heightening or lowering the
growth of the mass movement. For example, continued defeats in the Far East on a
background of Russian successes will incense the workers and hasten their
differentiation and regroupment towards the left. On the other hand, a defeat of
the Soviet Union would temporarily have profound repercussions on the British as
well as the international working class. Under these circumstances the workers
would see no alternative but to cling to the coat-tails of the bourgeoisie. The
activity of the Stalinists will delay the more extreme manifestations among the
workers, nevertheless the processes taking place have an inexorable logic in
their development and direction.</p>

<p>Whatever delays may be imposed, these cannot be of any great
duration - even in the event of the greatest catastrophe the working class
movement of the world has ever suffered, the defeat of the Soviet Union. Despite
all the efforts of the Labour leaders to canalise and give a parliamentary
expression to the movement of the workers, it will be impossible for them to
succeed. In this period the Tribune group of left social patriots will in all
probability step forward as the main organising centre of the leftward swing.</p>


<h4>The Communist Party</h4>

<p>Despite the handicaps of Stalinist policy, the revolutionary
traditions of the October Revolution and the militant activity conducted by the
party over a period of years, resulted in the key militants in a number of areas
turning to the Communist Party. Nevertheless, the Stalinists succeeded in
penetrating only the advanced layer of the working class without gaining a
widespread support among the masses.</p>

<p>During the 'anti-war' period, despite their adventurous
industrial policy they succeeded in extending their influence among the advanced
sections of the Industrial workers. It is a fact that the untiring work of the
best CP militants (without any real lead from above) redounded to the credit and
prestige of the Communist Party. In South Wales and in some parts of Scotland
they succeeded in capturing leading positions among the miners.</p>

<p>On Clydeside, among the most class conscious sections of the
British workers, their roots extend deep into the ship-building and engineering
industry. In other parts of the country they have succeeded in gaining
influential points of support. The National Council of Engineers and Allied Shop
Stewards came completely under the domination of the CP. With the extension of
the aircraft industry they bade fair to completely dominate the leadership of
the workers. Indeed in the event of a big upsurge among the workers, the
Communist Party had the opportunity to capture a leading role, as did the French
Communist Party at the beginning of the stay-in strikes in France.</p>

<p>However, with the new turn to class collaboration and
strikebreaking, some sections of the party, already disillusioned with the rapid
shifts in the policy of the tops, have become bewildered and disoriented.
Hundreds of the best militants in the local areas have been driven from the
party as 'Trotskyists' and 'agents of Hitler'. Meanwhile wide sections in the
factories and unions which followed in the wake of Stalinism because of past
militancy in the industrial field, have become alienated. This strike-breaking
policy has made it possible, by bold and militant leadership in the factories
and unions, to win over those politically unclear militants who followed in the
wake of Stalinism in the past.</p>

<p>The prospects of the Communist Party are dependent greatly on
the fortunes of the Soviet Union. The peculiar situation is developing by the
logic of the struggle, that where the party has its greatest grip - among the
advanced workers - here it is fast losing ground. But from the backward strata
now coming into political activity partly on the basis of their chauvinism and
partly by their association with Russia, the CP is recruiting a new membership
up and down the country. This shift was particularly noticeable in the
composition of the delegates to their 1942 Conference where more than half the
delegates had been in the party not more than three years. The new element
replaces in greater numbers those who have dropped out in disillusionment or
attempted opposition to the 'new' policy. But of course these are not so active
as those they are replacing. However, despite the turn, large numbers, with
secret misgivings perhaps, even the big majority of former members, remained
within the party.</p>

<p>Big successes for the Soviet Union or the failure of Hitler's
offensive cannot but lead to more support for 'communism' which will find
distorted expression in the Communist Party. Stalemate on the Eastern front will
have a similar result.</p>

<p>A complete destruction of the Soviet Union on the other hand
would lead to the obliteration of the Stalinist tendency, the most corrupt
section of the apparatus, as with Doriot<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-7" name="doc-7">(7)</a></sup>
in France, going over directly to the bourgeoisie; another section fusing with
the Labour and trade union bureaucracy; while the remainder will drop out of
politics altogether.</p>

<p>Given the continued resistance of the Soviet Union, the
revolutionary wave will lead inevitably to a temporary strengthening of the CP.
But this influence could not be of long duration. The strike-breaking policy
which is already repelling a section of the advanced strata of the workers will
force the workers away from the Stalinists.</p>

<p>Despite the expulsions and attempts to stifle criticism by the
use of a police regime within the party, the discontent of the workers is
reflected in the ranks of the party. A reflection of this is in the statement of
the Political Bureau issued in mid-1942 which admits to the fact that more
energy is expended by the party membership in discussing the electoral policy of
support for the Tories than in carrying out the party's agitation for the
'second front.' This criticism, which extends to all aspects of party policy has
forced the leadership to allege that the Trotskyists have become members of the
Young Communist League and Communist Party and are doing serious harm to the
party. This opposition, which is essentially revolutionary, must be reached and
gained as adherents to the Fourth International. From here some of the best
forces of the Fourth International will be recruited.</p>


<h4>The Independent Labour Party</h4>

<p>After years of complete isolation from the masses, the ILP is
beginning to revive. Numbers of workers, especially from the youth, disgusted
with the policy of the Labour Party and hostile to Stalinism, particularly in
its present shameless phase of support for Churchill, are moving towards the
ILP. The 'left' policy, veiling centrist confusion, has resulted in a definite
increase in membership. Whereas in the last few years it had completely lost
touch with the workers in the trade unions and industrial movement, it is now
beginning to penetrate the fringes of the movement. As the only opposition force
at by-elections of national importance, it has gained a certain standing among
the workers who are becoming disillusioned with the present government.</p>

<p>In addition, the long-standing tradition of the ILP within the
working class as the left wing of the workers' movement makes it inevitable,
that without any other organisation in sight, leftward moving workers should
gravitate almost automatically towards the ILP.</p>

<p>A steady growth within the coming months and years will be
inevitable. Revolutionary repercussions will push the more 'left' section of the
workers towards the ILP. Under these conditions the ILP will be one of the most
important recruiting grounds for the revolutionary party. It is not excluded in
the event of a mass upsurge, that a fusion of the extreme left of the Labour
Party with the ILP will take place to form a new centrist organisation. But even
if it became a mass party, the ILP could not exist as such for long. The
conflicting currents within it would break out in fractional struggles; splits
and disintegration would take place and speedily shatter it to pieces. Even the
relative stability which was achieved by the POUM in the Spanish revolution
could not be attained by the ILP. The present cohesion in the ILP, is based on
its divorce from the necessity of any real activity. Its entry into the arena of
mass politics would doom it to complete destruction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a change in the weather-cocks of the Labour
Party, always sensitive to the mood of the masses, might lead the ILP leadership
to drag at the tail of the Labour Party. But on whatever course events drive the
ILP, it is necessary that the organisation prepare now to influence the worker
revolutionaries in that party. A great part of our activity must be devoted
towards the ILP. Even now in large numbers of branches there are workers who are
thoroughly dissatisfied with the rotten compromising policy of the parliamentary
clique and the whole centrist leadership. They are looking for a way out,
honestly and sincerely seeking the revolutionary policy of Bolshevism.</p>

<p>The older layer of confirmed and crusted centrists has been
supplemented by a younger and fresher layer entering politics in large numbers
of cases for the first time. Numbers have entered since the war and are not
anchored to the ILP like the older and more conservative elements. Especially
necessary is the supplementing of the pressure of the revolutionaries within by
pressure on the ILP from the outside. Proposals for joint activity against the
bourgeoisie as well as against the Stalinist slander campaigns, etc, can break
down the hostility which the leadership attempts to foster towards the
Trotskyists.</p>


<h4>The Labour Party Tactic</h4>

<p>The tactic of our organisation up to and including the first
eighteen months of the war was to place the main emphasis on the Labour Party
and especially the Labour League of Youth. That this was correct up to the
outbreak of the war was indicated by the orientation of the ILP. Finding
themselves isolated from the mainstream of the workers' movement and falling
into complete decay, the ILP was compelled by the force of events, to turn
towards the mass organisation of the working class. The leadership entered into
discussions and conducted negotiations for re-entry into the Labour Party.</p>

<p>That advice of Trotsky which they so carelessly rejected in
1934, to turn to the Labour Party, they tardily adopted before the outbreak of
war, giving it an opportunist tinge, and found no other course except
capitulation to the Labour leaders. At that stage it seemed the most likely
course of events that the political awakening of the masses would move
completely on the traditional course and pass through the Labour Party.</p>

<p>But the outbreak of the war cut across the development of
events and produced a different pattern. Far from growing in activity and
political membership, the Labour Party machine in most areas has fallen to
pieces. Branches and wards, executives of divisions and towns do not meet for
months on end.</p>


<!-- The following is not in TUT -->

<p>Under these circumstances total submersion into the Labour Party could serve
only to separate the revolutionaries from the real struggles of the workers. Such
a perspective is farcical and can serve only as a cloak for complete inactivity.
The whole idea motivating the entrist tactic is to enter a reformist or centrist
organisation which is in a state of flux, where political life is at a high pitch,
and where the membership is steadily moving towards the left. It is essentially a
short term perspective of work in a milieu where favourable prospects exist for obtaining
results in a relatively short space of time. It is dictated principally by the isolation
of the revolutionary forces and the relative difficulty of reaching the ear of the
masses.</p>

<p>None of the conditions for such a tactic are in existence at the present time. Any
organisation operating it is doomed to stagnation without possibility of growth. Under
these conditions a radical reorientation of the vanguard becomes necessary. In those
areas where the Labour Party still shows signs of life, consistent work can acheive
results. But in distinction to the previous position such work must be subordinated
to the general strategy of building the Fourth International Party.</p>


<!-- End -->

<p>At the present time, political life within the working class
exists in the unions and in the factories. Most of the members of the Labour
League of Youth have been called up to the armed forces or work long hours in
industry. Already enfeebled by the heavy hand of Transport House<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-8" name="doc-8">(8)</a></sup>,
the League of Youth has disappeared as a political force, it is in the trade
unions, factory and shop committees where the militant workers are to be found
in a mood receptive to revolutionary ideas.</p>

<p>The situation dictates that our tasks lie in making known our
banner among the widest strata of the working class; and struggling for
leadership amongst the reactionary and reformist organisations.</p>

<p>The present period is characterised by a radicalisation and
ferment within the working class without a mass <em>political </em>vent for this
dissatisfaction. Insofar as the workers are moving at all at present, they are
expressing themselves on the industrial field.</p>


<!-- The following is not in TUT -->

<p>At a later stage they will turn to the Labour Party. But to come to workers
who are advanced enough to look for a road out - with the disguise of the
&quot;Left Wing of the Labour Party&quot; is idiotic. These workers will turn to
the ILP or the CP but not to the so-called &quot;Socialist Left of the Labour
Party&quot;.</p>

<p>The proponents of entry into the Labour Party have their eyes glued to the
future visage of the Labour Party and not to its present posterior. Using the
example of the last war, they argue, correctly enough, that the first big
revolutionary wave will immediately revive the Labour Party. It is true that
already symptoms of a turn to meet this wave are to be seen on the part of the
Labour leaders, especially the most shifty MPs are reflecting the growing
exasperation of the masses. But history never repeats itself in exactly the same
way. The masses of the workers, above all, the advanced stratum, have a certain
scepticism and cynicism towards the Labour leaders. The experience of the last
two decades and the collaboration with the Tories in the government, have not
failed to leave traces behind them in the consciousness of the workers.</p>

<p>It is useless to base the tactics of today on the possibilities of tomorrow;
or more precisely, without preparing the ground on the basis of the existing
situation it will be impossible to influence those masses who might enter
tomorrow in the slightest degree. Meanwhile all the favourable opportunities to
raise the banner of the Fourth International which will be present in the coming
period, will be missed. More and more the workers will tend to break the bonds
with which the Labour leaders have tied them to the fortunes of Capital and
advance on the road to independent action.</p>


<!-- End -->

<p>Careful attention must be paid to the processes taking place
within the working class, but the necessity remains for the main activity round
the general agitational and transitional demands, including the demand that
Labour break with the capitalists and take power on a socialist programme.</p>


<h4>Trade Unions and Factory Committees</h4>

<p>In Britain, more perhaps than in any other country in the
world, a correct policy towards the trade unions and factory committees is
necessary for a young revolutionary party. Without a correct attitude on this
question, our organisation would doom itself to vegetate in sectarian isolation.
This is especially the case today when the workers are beginning to stir and
awaken - from the period of relative 'peace' in industry which followed the
debacle of the Labour Party in 1931, and when the whole of the working class is
undergoing a transformation in its outlook.</p>

<p>This awakening of the working class is shown by the number of
strikes that are taking place in formerly backward areas which were only
partially organised before the war. Commencing with Betteshanger Colliery, the
unrest among the miners - always a barometer of the temper of the British
workers - has been followed by strikes on one coalfield after another. Small
strikes have taken place among the dockers, railwaymen, engineers and
ship-building workers. All these have for the present been limited to a local
scale. But they are the first rumblings that give warning of the coming
eruption.</p>

<p>The bourgeoisie and the Labour bureaucracy are looking with
alarm on these signs of discontent among the workers, and have been compelled to
retreat and compromise. They are afraid that by too stubborn opposition, they
might release forces beyond their power to control. This process, however, is
developing in a contradictory fashion. It can be seen, for example, that despite
the terrific discontent among the highly class conscious workers in South Wales
and Clydeside, no big movement is taking place in these traditional storm
centres. The reason for this has not been unwillingness on the part of the
workers to fight. It is the stranglehold exercised by the Stalinists over the
shop stewards and leading militants in these districts. Undoubtedly, but for
this feature, there would already have been a general strike on the Clydeside,
at least among the ship-building workers. Had the Stalinists been pursuing their
pseudo-left line of the 'people's government' period, they would today be at the
head of a mass movement throughout the country. It is no exaggeration to say
that they would probably have captured the rank and file militants in every
union in industry. But the changing of the party line after Hitler's attack on
Russia, revealed the true face of Stalinism: the Communist Party has come
forward as the principal strike-breaking force at the service of the ruling
class.</p>

<p>This offers a tremendous opportunity to the Fourth
International, and one which must be utilised to the fullest possible extent.
Once again it must be emphasised - face to the factories, the unions, the
factory committees!</p>

<p>It is impossible for the Stalinists to dam up the tide of
militancy of the British workers for any length of time. Their attempts to
divert it into joint Production Committees will merely serve to discredit them
at a later stage. The workers will learn from experience that this road leads
not so much to increased production as to increased slavery. Revolutionaries
must take into account the attitude of the workers to the question of
production. In a false and distorted fashion the Stalinists have themselves
raised the question of 'control' of production through these committees. Their
failure to achieve results will lead the workers to draw the conclusions of
workers' control on the morrow.</p>

<p>In is noteworthy that already throughout the country militants
in the factories and trade unions are becoming aware of the role of joint
Production Committees and the strike-breaking role of the Stalinists. This is
especially so where we have members who can crystallise this opposition mood.</p>

<p>In the past, the best workers who sought a militant industrial
policy were almost automatically dragged in the wake of Stalinism - even where
they did not support the whole policy of the Communist Party. Now, many of them
are instinctively refusing to accept the Communist Party's class collaboration
policy. Such workers can be won to the programme of the revolution. They must be
won to that programme and to the banner of the Fourth International!</p>

<p>Today our Transitional Programme takes on flesh and blood
before our eyes. The response to our industrial slogans and propaganda has
underlined the vital importance of partial, transitional demands. Our tiny voice
and our inadequate forces have received a wonderful response from that part of
the working class we have been able to reach. With an energetic application of
our Transitional Programme this influence can be increased a hundred-fold in the
period which lies immediately ahead.</p>

<p>The Stalinists have added their shrieks to the hallelujah of
the Labour leaders' chorus of 'go back to work' just at the time when the
workers are becoming increasingly opposed to the treachery of Transport House.
The Stalinist demagogues are, of course, much more skilful in putting over their
blackleg policy, but, armed with a correct programme and attitude, these
gentlemen can be dealt with by our comrades on the spot.</p>

<p>The struggle must be waged against the trade union bureaucracy
no less than against Stalinism. The propaganda to remove strike-breakers from
the leadership of the trade unions, now comes to the fore. Within the unions
there is developing a critical attitude towards the leadership. Some of the
local officials of the unions are becoming radicalised and are pushing forward
as militant leaders. Others of the local officials have remained with the
bureaucracy through inertia. Either they will learn, or they will have to be
thrust aside. What is outstanding at the present time is that the rank and file
are to the left of even the militant elements among the leadership. But only a
tiny section of workers have drawn the logical conclusions from the sabotage of
the leadership. The majority are in opposition to the strike-breaking
officialdom, but are not fully conscious of the next step in the struggle. It is
our task to provide that consciousness. We must fight to renew even the topmost
strata of the trade-union leadership; we must fight to convert the unions into
organs of the revolution.</p>

<p>Even more vital than work in the unions, is work among the
shop stewards in the factories. These are directly under the pressure of the
workers on the job, and this is assuring that old reformist elements (and now
the Stalinists) are being replaced by a fresh layer of militants. Workers who
previously took no active interest in union affairs are today being pushed to
offer themselves as alternative 'unofficial' stewards.</p>

<p>As the struggle develops it will extend through the efforts of
the local leaders, to other factories; from single localities to a regional and
finally to a national scale. Spontaneously the workers will create fighting
committees on a local and national scale which will embrace not only one
industry but all the industries in the areas affected. This movement will give
expression to the long dormant energies and power of the British proletariat and
will assume tremendous scope. The Stalinists and Labour leaders will use 'left'
phrases in attempts to divert these energies into the channels of the
bourgeoisie. They will only succeed in this if we fail to play our part in the
struggle.</p>

<p>The leadership of this movement can be won if our key
militants in the decisive areas can give a lead to the workers. Our small forces
must be trained and prepared to give leadership to the workers on all problems
that face them in industry. Our opportunities in the factories are unlimited.
With a correct policy and a true orientation we can grow at a tremendous pace, a
pace that will enable us to face the gigantic tasks which confront us, with
confidence. <em>Face to the Unions, factories and factory committees.</em></p>


<h4>Britain Entering a Pre-Revolutionary Period</h4>

<p>Among the backward elements in the ranks of both civilians and
soldiers there is to be observed an undercurrent of reactionary and anti-semitic
moods. The bourgeoisie has attempted to canalise these tendencies to suit its
own interests, particularly by giving its campaign against the black market, a
veiled anti-semitic slant. But these moods are not based on, and do not
represent, the dominant current, which is to the left.</p>

<p>Under the influence of the war and of Britain's changed
position in the world, profound processes are taking place in the consciousness
of broad sections of the working class. The age-old 'conservatism' of the
British masses had its real basis in the privileged position of Britain in the
markets of the world, and the super-exploitation of the colonial masses. Now
with that foundation crumbling, so also is the outlook, upon which it had been
built. The main burdens of the war are now being shifted on to the shoulders of
the British workers. Millions of them have been violently torn out of their
customary routine and inertia by the war. The basis of 'family life' has been
shattered.</p>

<p>Women, the most oppressed and backward strata of the working
class, as well as the youth, have been forced into industry and the armed
forces. The old conception of a 'tranquil' and 'ordered' existence is being
shattered by events. And as the conditions of the masses have changed, so has
their consciousness. They have become responsive to new ideas and perspectives.
The old faith in the ruling class and the acceptance of the continued
coexistence of classes has virtually vanished. The unemployed have become
re-proletarianised and the demoralised elements placed under the. discipline and
organisation of the army and industry. Large sections of the middle class have
been reduced to the level of proletarians and forced into the factories.</p>

<p>The mood of discontent simmering among the workers and middle
class has had no outlet yet. In fact, a great deal of it has been directed, for
the present, even into patriotic channels.</p>

<p>Aroused principally by the incompetence of the ruling class in
'fighting fascism' and backed up by the lessons of France where the capitalist
class acted as direct capitulators to Hitler, this discontent has found no
channel which leads to a genuine fight against fascism. The Labour and Communist
Parties accept the continued rule of the capitalists, and utter shrill warnings
that any break in 'national unity' will mean victory for Hitler! The ILP offers
only pacifism.</p>

<p>In spite of this, the molecular changes within the ranks of
the workers have proceeded apace. The 'Churchill myth' has passed its apogee and
is now on the downward grade. The mood of the masses has become increasingly
critical and its waves are beating ceaselessly against the walls of class
collaboration. Despite the efforts of the Bevins and the Pollitts<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-9" name="doc-9">(9)</a></sup>
to stop the first little gaps in the dyke with their fists, the mighty mass
pressure cannot for long be resisted. In a short space of time the wall must
crumble.</p>

<p>If the ruling class, under the threat of revolution, were to
attempt to capitulate to Hitler as the French bourgeoisie did, they would
immediately provoke an uprising among the masses. Such an attempt at
capitulation would compel the Labour leaders to place themselves at the head of
the masses in order to continue the war. Because of the feeling that would be
aroused among the masses, and because their own heads would be at stake, they
would be compelled to wage a struggle to take control into their own hands. At
least the left wing would do so. This would immediately precipitate the
socialist revolution. But such a development is improbable in the extreme.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, complete victory over Germany and Japan
were to be gained by Britain (in reality the USA) this too could not prevent
revolutionary repercussions among the masses. The programme of finance capital
is utopian and insane. The idea that the British masses would tolerate the
forcible holding down of the continent of Europe and Asia, not to mention
Africa, is absurd. Once the masses compare the glittering promises about 'after
the war', of which they are sceptical even today, their indignation will rise to
unprecedented heights when confronted with reality.</p>

<p>Freed from the nightmare of victory for the nazis, neither the
workers nor the soldiers would tolerate for long the outcome of the conflict
which the capitalist class is preparing. Revolutionary explosions would be
inevitable.</p>

<p>The prospect of stalemate and a compromise peace is even more
remote. The antagonisms which brought about the war and have been sharpened by
it, have now reached an unbearable tensity. Compromise could only come after the
contestants were completely exhausted and the whole world was drained dry. This
could only lead to further explosions. Long before the war had reached such a
stage, and it would require several years, the endurance of the masses would
have reached breaking point and the stability of the imperialist regimes would
be put to the test. Revolution would begin in Europe or Asia and alter the whole
balance of forces.</p>

<p><em>All three possibilities in regard to the war</em>, therefore,
lead to the same conclusion. The struggle between the classes in Britain must
inevitably lead to the socialist revolution.</p>

<p>In the event of the failure of the working class to show a way
out of the crisis in which the bourgeoisie has placed society, a terrible social
and political reaction would rage in Britain. The worsened position of British
imperialism in the world market would dictate the need for the bourgeoisie to
destroy all working class resistance to its imposition of lower standards of
living, etc. A failure of the coming revolutionary wave would provoke outbursts
of despair and hopelessness among the petty bourgeoisie and the backward strata
of the working class. Basing itself on this mood, the bourgeoisie would, within
the shortest space of time, create a fascist party and attempt to obliterate the
organisations of the working class. <em>But this reaction would only arise after
a defeat of the inevitable revolution.</em></p>

<p>Taking the situation as a whole, it can be seen that more
favourable opportunities exist for the British Trotskyists and for the success
of the socialist revolution in Britain than for almost any other country.</p>

<p>The British working class has not suffered a severe defeat
since the general strike of 1926 and the debacle of Labour in the general
election of 1931. No big class struggles were waged in the last years before the
outbreak of the war. The British workers are fresh and unjaded. They possess an
overwhelming weight in British society. Concentrated as it is in big industrial
cities, London, Glasgow, Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester, Swansea, etc,
the working class finds its preponderating social weight still further
increased.</p>

<p>That two and a half years after the outbreak of the most
sanguinary battle for survival among the imperialist powers, most of the
democratic rights of the working class, although formally abolished, are still
intact, is a testimonial not of the strength of British imperialism, but
indicates its Achilles' heel.</p>

<p>The ruling class is compelled to seek salvation in deceit and
demagogy rather than in force. The continued, if precarious, existence of
democratic rights gives us possibilities of growth in the most favourable of
conditions. It arises out of the necessity on the part of the ruling class to
disguise their imperialist war as one between democracy and dictatorship. It
also arises, of course from the present dependence of the bourgeoisie on the
shell of the organisations of the working class. All this gives us a unique
opportunity of conducting our work legally, unhampered by the trammels which
fascism and occupation have attached to our comrades on the continent.</p>


<h4>The Future is Ours</h4>

<p>The possibility exists for an unprecedented growth in
influence and numbers in the shortest possible time. Today the problem consists
mainly in preparing the basis for a rapid increase in growth and influence. The
Workers International League will grow with the growth of the left wing. It is
necessary to break sharply and consciously, as the group is already doing, with
the psychology and perspectives of the past. The most difficult period is in the
past -isolated membership and the hostility or indifference of the masses. Big
movements and big events <em>which we can influence </em>are on the order of the
day. The group must not be caught unawares by the development of events.</p>

<p>It is necessary that the membership systematically face the
workers and penetrate among the masses. Above all, it is necessary to bring the
Fourth International before the masses of the workers as an independent
tendency.</p>

<p>It is necessary that the organisation face up critically to
the most vital of all factors: the leadership and the organisation are lagging
behind the development of events. Objectively, conditions are developing and
have already developed, which make for the speediest and most favourable growth
and entrenchment of our organisation. But the basic weakness lies in the lack of
trained cadres. The membership is for the most part young and untrained and
lacks theoretical education. The organisation, despite the leap in influence,
still maintains for the most part the habits and attitude of mind of the past -
that is, of propaganda circles rather than of branches for agitation among the
masses. The difficulties and tasks of the past period of the group's life are
still reflected in its ideas and work. On the basis of the new perspective a
sharp break must be made with the past.</p>

<p>It can be stated without exaggeration that the decisive
question of whether the organisation will be able to face up to events will be
determined by whether the leadership and membership can base themselves
thoroughly in the shortest space of time, on these perspectives and face up to
implementing them in the day to day work of the organisation. To develop deep
and firm roots and to become known as a tendency and organisation throughout the
country, and above all, among the advanced workers in the factories is the basic
task of the organisation.</p>

<p>The disproportion in the situation in Britain lies in the lack
of relationship between the ripeness of the objective situation and the
immaturity and weakness of our organisation. Prospects of a swift impulsion of
the masses leading to a spectacular growth of the organisation on the lines of
the POUM in the Spanish revolution, are rooted in the situation. But only if we
realise the scope of the tasks and possibilities which history has placed before
us. We will rise to the situation only <em>if in the interim, skeleton cadres are
built throughout the country. </em>These cadres would serve as the bones on which
the body of a powerful organistion could be built up from the new and fresh
recruits who will come towards us as the crisis develops.</p>

<p>These tasks must be accomplished. Our untrained and untested
organisation, will, within a few years at most, be hurled into the turmoil of
the revolution. The problem of the organisation, the problem of building the
party, goes hand in hand with the revolutionary mobilisation of the masses.
Every member must raise himself or herself to the understanding that the key to
world history lies in our hands. The conquest of power is on the order of the
day in Britain - but only if we find the road to the masses.</p>

<p>Revolutionary audacity can achieve everything. The
organisation must consciously pose itself and see itself as the decisive factor
in the situation. There will be no lack of possibilities for transforming
ourselves from a tiny sect into a mass organisation on the wave of the
revolution.</p>
