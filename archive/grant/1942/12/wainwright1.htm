<p class="fst">William Wainwright, modestly signing himself W.W., has written an article in
<i>World News and Views</i> of November 21<sup>st</sup> 1942, the pretended purpose of 
which is to expose Jacques Doriot, leader of the fascist Popular Party in 
France.</p>
<p>In reality, following the time worn methods of the &#8220;Communist&#8221; Party, the 
real aim is to slander and vilify the Trotskyists.</p>
<p>First Wainwright pretends to believe that Doriot is a Trotskyist. He is as 
much a Trotskyist as Wainwright himself could be described a Trotskyist. Both 
have the same credentials, i.e. Doriot at the service of Stalin slandered and 
lied about Trotsky&#8217;s policies; now Wainwright jumps into the vacant space left 
by Doriot to fulfil the same purpose.</p>
<p>In order to understand this, it is only necessary to examine the biography of 
Doriot. He was one of the leaders of the French Communist Party from its 
earliest days. When the split came in Russia between Stalin and Trotsky, judging 
that Stalin would win, he supported him in the struggle and came out as a 
violent opponent against Trotskyism. Faithfully and cynically carrying out the 
policy of Stalin, he helped carry through Stalin&#8217;s policy in 1925-1927, which 
led to the defeat of the Chinese revolution. It was here that he learned to 
practise the habit of lies and deception in the interests of the Stalinist 
&#8220;line&#8221;. When on a delegation representing the Communist workers, instead of 
warning the Chinese workers and peasants against the role of Chiang Kai-Shek and 
the Chinese capitalists, who would betray the revolution and slaughter the 
masses, Doriot kept silent. He kept silent to cover the policy of his then 
master Stalin. Just as Wainwright today covers up the crimes of Churchill, De 
Gaulle and Co. for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Doriot was sent by the Communist International as a member of an 
international delegation on a mission to China. This mission &#8220;passed through 
town after town where the unions had already been driven underground, and in 
Kanchow they received detailed reports on the murder of Chen Tsang-shen, a local 
trade union leader killed by Chiang&#8217;s orders only a few weeks previously.&#8221; (<i>Tragedy 
of the Chinese revolution</i>, by H. Isaacs) Doriot, <i>after</i> the betrayal 
of the Chinese revolution, wrote: &#8220;The Kanchow incidents taught us a precious 
lesson. We knew from that moment on&mdash;well before the split&mdash;that the conflict 
between the bourgeoisie and the Chinese working class would take on the bloody 
forms it has since assumed&hellip;&#8221; But, in obedience to Stalin&#8217;s policy, he kept 
silent on this and attacked Trotsky and the Trotskyists, who were warning the 
workers precisely of the inevitability of what happened.</p>
<p>From 1927 to 1933 he faithfully followed the policy of the Communist 
International, which made the victory of Hitler inevitable: the policy of 
denouncing the Socialists as Social Fascists and refusing a united front with 
them against fascism. Doriot in France denounced Trotsky as a social fascist and 
counter revolutionary, as obediently as the rest of the hacks in the Comintern, 
for demanding a united front of Socialists and Communists to prevent Hitler from 
coming to power.</p>
<p>Doriot was expelled in 1934, after the &#8220;Communist&#8221; Party had demonstrated, 
together with the fascists, for the overthrow of the Liberal Government on 
February 6<sup>th</sup>. He was expelled from the C.P. for proposing a united front against 
the fascist bands! But Doriot never joined the Trotskyists. Just the contrary. 
He continued his attacks against Trotsky and the Trotskyists. He had been 
corrupted too well by the cynical school of Stalinism. It was but a short step 
for him to go over to fascism and offer his services to the capitalist class. It 
is significant that on the road to fascism he tarried for a while in the Popular 
Front in France. For the whole of his political life Doriot fought against 
Trotsky and Trotskyism.</p>
<p>But to return to Wainwright. Having failed with his forgeries and lies in the 
pamphlet <i>Clear Out Hitler&#8217;s Agents,</i> to convince the workers and even the 
advanced workers in the C.P. itself of the truth of the slander that Trotskyists 
are fascists, Wainwright attempts, by a new series of quotations, to prove that 
the policy of the Trotskyists is the same as that of Doriot. This time he 
selects passages from the <i>Socialist Appeal</i>. Let us have a look at these 
&#8220;quotations&#8221;:</p>

	<p class"quoteb">&#8220;The Treaty between the Soviet Union and British Imperialism&hellip;is 
	primarily a conspiracy.&#8221; (<i>Socialist Appeal</i>, July 1942)</p>

<p class="fst">Now read the <i>Socialist Appeal</i> of July 1942, from which this is taken:</p>

	<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The ruling class is not interested in the defeat of &#8216;Hitlerism&#8217; as such. 
	They are concerned only once and for all, with destroying the power of their 
	German rival and obtaining domination of Europe and as much of the world as 
	they can hold.</p>
	<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The defeat of Hitler opens out the prospect of revolution in Germany and 
	in the whole of Europe&mdash;a revolution which could not fail to spread to the 
	British Isles. The ruling class has collaborated with the Soviet Union only 
	because of the way in which Russia has fought the war as a &#8220;national&#8221; war 
	and not as part of the international struggle of the working class. </p>
	<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It was because of this that the imperialists of Britain and America could 
	even afford themselves the luxury of giving the Soviet Union a certain 
	amount of aid. But they now desire further guarantees that after the war 
	their position of domination will be firmly entrenched throughout the world&mdash;i.e.
	that the revolutions, which are inevitable in Europe, should be 
	crushed. This is the meaning of the treaty between the Soviet Union and 
	British imperialism. It is primarily a conspiracy against the German and 
	European working class.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This quotation speaks for itself. Let us examine the second quotation, 
selected by Wainwright:</p>

	<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We have resolutely opposed the policy of &#8216;pressing&#8217; Churchill for a 
	Second Front.&#8221; (<i>Socialist Appeal</i>, November 1942)</p>

<p class="fst">Now read the <i>Socialist Appeal</i> from where this is taken:</p>

	<p class="quoteb">&#8220;As against the short sighted policy of support for Churchill and 
	Roosevelt, we have urged the independence of the labour movement from the 
	capitalist class: we have fought for workers&#8217; control of the sending of arms 
	to Russia; and we have resolutely opposed the policy of &#8216;pressing&#8217; Churchill 
	for a Second Front, knowing that such a military move would be undertaken by 
	the imperialists at the moment of their own choosing for their own aims of 
	dismembering the Soviet Union and stifling the European revolution by 
	wresting control from their hands.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">It will be observed that Wainwright has to pretend that these quotations are 
the beginning and end of sentences and for this purpose he obligingly adds full 
stops and capital letters where none exist! Just an old fashioned Stalinist 
custom! Wainwright uses his quotations to &#8220;prove&#8221; that the Trotskyists are in 
favour of fascism and opposed to the Soviet Union. One glance at the <i>
Socialist Appeal</i> reveals that the articles were directed to demonstrate the 
real policy of Churchill and the British ruling class and the dangers to which 
the false policy of Stalin and the Comintern were leading the Soviet Union and 
the world working class.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the question of whether the opinions and ideas were correct or 
not, that was the point of view which we revolutionary socialists hold, and we 
firmly believe events will prove us correct. We claim this is the Leninist point 
of view. Why then did this Stalinist hack have to resort to lies and deliberate 
misrepresentation? If our point of view is incorrect, surely it should not be 
too difficult to prove this? Here we get the difference between Leninism and 
Stalinism. Marx and Lenin prided themselves on the fact that never once in the 
thousands of articles and books they wrote, did they distort or lie on the 
position adopted by an opponent. And indeed it would be impossible to ever find 
a lie or perversion in the writings of Marx or Lenin. And for a very simple 
reason. They were so convinced of the correctness of their policies, that they 
knew any worker comparing their ideas with those of their opponents could not 
fail to arrive at the conclusion that they were right. Lenin even advised his 
supporters among the workers to read his opponents! Furthermore, he taught that 
lies and slander were the weapons of capitalist reaction. The weapon of truth is 
the most powerful weapon of all.</p>
<p>It is this tradition which Trotsky handed on to the Fourth International. 
Stalinism resorts to the methods of lies and slander. Wainwright, as a 
Stalinist, is without honour, without truth and without conscience. Methods such 
as these can only train and create&hellip;Doriots!</p>
<p>As for us, we shall continue on the path of Marxism. No amount of lies, 
slander, or persecution will prevent us from answering the capitalists and 
Stalinists with the weapon of truth. And in spite of all, the truth will 
prevail. Our policy and ideas will become the policy of the working class, 
including the majority of the rank and file members of the Communist Party.</p>
