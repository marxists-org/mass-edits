<p>On the threshold of the twenty-first century, humanity stands at the  crossroads. On the one hand, the achievements of science, technique and  industry point the way forward to a dazzling future of prosperity, social  well-being and unlimited cultural advance. On the other, the very existence of  the human race is threatened by the ravishing of the planet in the name of  profit; mass unemployment, which was confidently asserted to be a thing of the  past, has reappeared in all the advanced countries of capitalism, not to speak  of the nightmare of poverty, ignorance, wars and epidemics which constantly  afflict two thirds of humanity in the so-called &ldquo;Third World.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the bureaucratic Stalinist  regimes of Russia and Eastern Europe provoked a wave of euphoria in the West.  The demise of Stalinism was heralded as the &ldquo;end of Socialism.&rdquo; The final  victory of the &ldquo;free market&rdquo; was trumpeted from the pages of learned journals  from Tokyo to New York. The strategists of capital were exultant. Francis  Fukuyama even went so far as to proclaim the &ldquo;end of history.&rdquo; Henceforth, the  class war would be no more. Everything would be for the best in the best of all  capitalist worlds.</p>
<h4>Ideological counter-offensive</h4>
<p>
In the last few years we have witnessed an unprecedented offensive against  the ideas of socialism on a world scale. The collapse of the bureaucratically  controlled planned economies of the East was held up as the definitive proof of  the failure of &ldquo;communism,&rdquo; and, of course, the ideas of Marx.</p>
<p>
This is not the place to deal in depth with the reasons for the collapse of  Stalinism. That will be done in a future work in this series. The fall of  Stalinism came as no surprise to the Marxists, who had predicted it in advance.  Indeed, Leon Trotsky already analysed the bureaucratic regime in the Soviet  Union in the 1930s and, using the Marxist method, explained the inevitability  of its collapse.</p>
<p>
In the first place, Stalinism and socialism (or communism), so far from  being identical, are mutually exclusive. The regimes in the USSR and its  Eastern European satellites in many ways were the opposite of socialism. As  Trotsky explained, a nationalised planned economy needs democracy as the human  body requires oxygen. Without the democratic control and administration of the  working class, a regime of nationalisation and planning would inevitably seize  up at a certain point, especially in a modern, sophisticated and complex  economy. This fact is graphically reflected in the falling rate of growth of  the Soviet economy since the early 1970s, after the unprecedented successes of  the planned economy in the earlier period.</p>
<p>
However, what the Western critics of Marxism do not want to publicise is  that the movement in the direction of a capitalist market economy in the former  Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, far from improving the situation, has caused  an unmitigated social and economic disaster.</p>
<p>
It is true that the productive forces stagnated under Brezhnev. But what is  the position now? Every index points to a catastrophe of unprecedented  dimensions. If we take the last three years, there has been a decline of  industrial production in Russia of about 40-45%. This is a staggering collapse&#8212;far worse than the slump of 1929-32 in the West. Investment fell by 45% in  1992, and an additional 12% in 1993, and continues to fall. Inflation topped  20% every month in mid-1993. The rouble has collapsed and the rate of exchange  is now 1,250 to the dollar, and still falling.</p>
<p>
This situation can only be compared to the effect of defeat in a  devastating war. The effects on the population, which has rapidly been reduced  to absolute misery, can best be shown in the sudden deterioration of life  expectancy.</p>
<p>
Under the planned economy, the people of the Soviet Union enjoyed a level  of life expectancy, health care and education on a level with the most  developed capitalist countries, or in advance of them. What is the position  now?</p>
<p>
The Financial Times of 14/2/94 carried a front page article with the title &ldquo;Russia  faces population crisis as death rate soars.&rdquo; The article points out that: &ldquo;In  the past year alone, the death rate jumped 20 per cent, or 360,000 deaths more  than in 1992. Researches now believe that the average age for male mortality in  Russia has sunk to 59&#8212;far below the average in the industrialised world and  the lowest in Russia since the early 1960s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
These figures merely confirm what is self-evident: That the attempt to  impose a &ldquo;market economy&rdquo; on the peoples of the former Soviet Union has been a  finished recipe for destroying all the gains of the past seventy years, driving  down living standards and plunging society as a whole into an abyss.</p>
<p>
Of course, the apologists of capital assure us that all this will be  temporary, that &ldquo;in the long run&rdquo; the market will create the conditions for  prosperity. To which we can answer in the words of Keynes: &ldquo;In the long run, we&rsquo;re  all dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
A few years ago, the Western media confidently predicted that capitalism  was about to enjoy a new period of dazzling economic success, on the basis of  new markets in Russia and Eastern Europe. These illusions have been rapidly  shattered by reality. Under capitalism a &ldquo;market&rdquo; is not a question of the size  of population. If that were so, then India and Africa would be huge markets.  However, a market depends upon purchasing power&#8212;something which is noticeable  by its absence in the ex-Stalinist countries. Far from providing new markets  for capitalism, these countries represent a colossally destabilising factor, as  most clearly shown by events in former Yugoslavia and the former USSR itself.</p>
<h4>World Capitalist Crisis</h4>
<p>
Trotsky&rsquo;s Introduction to &ldquo;The Living Thoughts of Karl Marx&rdquo; represents a  classic restatement of the basic positions of Marxism. In all its essentials,  it has been brilliantly confirmed by the present evolution of capitalism on a  world scale. Nevertheless, for a whole period following the Second World War,  it appeared to many to have been falsified by the march of events.</p>
<p>
As Trotsky had predicted, the Second World War ended in a new revolutionary  upsurge. In the period 1943-7, the working class moved time and again to  transform society in Italy, France, Greece, Britain, Denmark and Eastern  Europe. The betrayal of the revolution by Stalinism and Social Democracy  provided the political basis for a recovery of the equilibrium of capitalism.  This was the prior condition for the economic upswing which lasted from 1948 to  1974. </p>
<p>
It must be emphasised that there is no such thing as a &ldquo;final crisis of  capitalism&rdquo;. Marxism understands history as a struggle of living forces, not an  abstract schema with a preordained result. If the working class does not  overthrow it, the capitalist system will always find a way out.</p>
<p>
The reasons for the post-war economic upswing have been explained by  Marxists since the 1950s (see Ted Grant: &ldquo;<a href="../../../grant/1960/slump.htm">Will There be a Slump?</a>&rdquo;). There were  many different factors, such as post-war reconstruction, the discovery of new industries during the war, and to some extent the increased involvement of the  state (&ldquo;state capitalism&rdquo;) through arms expenditure, deficit financing and  nationalisation, which, for a temporary period partially mitigated the central  contradiction of private ownership of the means of production.</p>
<p>
However, the main factor which acted as a motor-force driving the world  economy was the unprecedented expansion of world trade. Thus, the Financial  Times (16/12/93) pointed out that:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Over the whole period between 1950 and 1991, the volume of total world  exports grew twelve times, while world output grew six times. More startlingly  still, the volume of world exports of manufactures rose twenty three times,  partly because this is where trade liberalisation was concentrated, while  output grew eight times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
These figures clearly show how the rapid expansion of world trade in the  post-war period acted as a powerful motor-force which drove the growth in  output. This is the secret of the capitalist upswing from 1948-74. It means  that, for a whole historical period, capitalism was able partially to overcome  its other fundamental problem&#8212;the contradiction between the narrowness of the  national market and the tendency of the means of production to develop on a  global scale.</p>
<p>
Now, however, this tendency appears to have reached its limits. In 1992,  world trade grew by 6,5%. While this is a lower rate than in the period of the  post-war upswing, it is nevertheless historically quite high. (In the period  between the Wars it was nearer 2.5%.) Despite this, it did not stop Europe and  Japan from sliding into recession. In other words, the growth of world trade no  longer has the same effect as in the previous period.</p>
<p>
During the period of capitalist upswing from 1948-74, we saw a staggering  increase in the productive forces, fuelled and stimulated by an unprecedented  expansion of world trade.</p>
<p>
The capitalists, above all in Japan, the USA and Western Europe, were  prepared to invest colossal sums in expanding the productive forces in pursuit  of profit. The productivity of labour increased enormously as a result of a  constant revolutionising of the means of production. New branches of industry  were established&#8212;plastics, atomic energy, computers, transistors, lasers,  robots, etc.</p>
<p>
From a Marxist point of view, this was an historically progressive  development, which creates the material basis for a socialist society. The  strengthening of the working class and the squeezing out of the peasantry in  Western Europe, Japan and the United States, also changed the class balance of  forces within society to the advantage of the proletariat.</p>
<p>
However, this period of capitalist expansion came to an end with the  recession of 1973-4. Already in that period we saw the re-emergence of mass  unemployment, not seen since the 1930s. The big movements of the working class  in Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Britain showed that the workers were  beginning to draw revolutionary conclusions from their experience.</p>
<p>
This was temporarily cut across by the boom of 1982-90. However, this boom  was completely different to the economic upswing of 1948-74. Originally sparked  off by the Reagan rearmament programme, the boom of the 1980s was of an unsound  character. Whereas the parasitic service sector underwent a big expansion, the  capitalists continued to close factories and lay off workers in all countries. </p>
<p>
The boom was kept going by a massive expansion of credit, which, as Marx  explains, can temporarily take capitalism beyond its limits, before bouncing  back like an elastic band stretched almost to breaking-point. A further element  in the situation was a colossal increase in the public deficit of the USA and  other capitalist countries which fuelled the boom for a while, but which could  not be sustained indefinitely.</p>
<p>
Precisely these factors which served to prolong the boom of the 1980s have  now turned into their opposite. Part of the reason why the Western world is  finding it so hard to drag itself out of recession is because they used up  during the boom mechanisms which capitalism uses to get out of a slump.</p>
<p>
The uncontrolled expansion of credit has left the West with a painful  hangover in the form of huge consumer indebtedness. In Japan, for example, for  every 100 yen earned, 170 yen are owed. In the United States, for every dollar  earned, a dollar two cents are owed, and so on.</p>
<p>
The bourgeois economists failed to predict this recession, which is the  longest and most severe since the Second World War. Of course, sooner or later  they will get out of it. However, it is proving to be extremely difficult. With  the exception of a very shaky recovery in Britain and a rather more stronger  one in the USA, the other economies of Western Europe and Japan remain  stubbornly depressed. The official predictions of recovery are constantly  postponed and revised downward.</p>
<p>
The Economist (Dec.1993-Jan.1994) reports that: &ldquo;The OECD now predicts that  average growth in its member countries will speed up (!) to 2.1% in 1994 and  2.7% in 1995, after average growth of only 1.2% in each of the past three  years. Some countries will fare better than others. A solid, if unspectacular,  recovery is already underway in the United States, Canada, Britain, Australia  and New Zealand&#8212;the countries that dipped into recession first. All five are  tipped to grow by around 3% or more in both 1994 and 1995.</p>

<h4>&ldquo;Continental Europe and Japan, however, remain  obstinately in recession.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>
Even a growth of 3% would be a miserable result. It would not mean a  substantial fall in unemployment. Hence, the Financial Times refers glumly to &ldquo;a  joyless recovery.&rdquo; But it is not even certain that they will attain this level  of growth. A year ago the OECD predicted that Japan would grow by 2.3% in 1993,  and 3.1% in 1994. Instead, Japan&rsquo;s GDP actually fell by 0.5% in 1993 and the  forecast for 1994 is only 0.5%. Compare these figures to the normal Japanese  growth rate of 4-5% a year and we see the very profound nature of the crisis.</p>
<p>
Even on the most optimistic estimates, unemployment in the OECD will remain  (officially) at 8.5% for the next two years. In Europe, the average rate of  unemployment will continue to rise to at least 11.5%. In other words, a  sluggish (&ldquo;joyless&rdquo;) boom will solve none of the fundamental problems of the  capitalist system. In fact, it will exacerbate them.</p>
<p>
Whereas in the period of upswing from 1948-74 we had long periods of boom  interrupted by shallow and short recessions, a very different picture is now  emerging: of relatively weak periods of boom, characterised by low rates of  investment, low growth and permanently high unemployment, which are only the  prelude to increasingly deep and prolonged periods of slump. Such is the  glittering prospect which capitalism offers to humanity on the eve of the new  millennium.</p>
<h4>Mass Unemployment</h4>
<p>
One of the most malignant symptoms of the diseased state of capitalism in  its epoch of senile decay is the appearance of mass organic unemployment.</p>
<p>
During the period of capitalist upswing, mass unemployment was alleged to  be a thing of the past. Through Keynesian deficit financing and &ldquo;managed  capitalism,&rdquo; the capitalist cycle of &ldquo;boom and bust&rdquo; was supposed to have been  overcome. Marx had been shown to be fundamentally wrong!</p>
<p>
In point of fact, even in this period the capitalist cycle of boom and  slump continued to exist. However, under conditions of general upswing, the  small slumps or recessions which took place were generally short and shallow,  and were hardly noticed by the masses. </p>
<p>
In the 1950s and 60s, the average unemployment in the advanced capitalist  economies of the OECD was about 2-3%. Most Western governments defined this as &ldquo;full employment.&rdquo; Now this situation appears as a dim and distant  memory. Today, half the OECD countries have a jobless rate of 10% or more.  Since the early 1970s, unemployment in the advanced capitalist world has more  than doubled.</p>
<p>
According to the official statistics, which deliberately falsify and  underestimate the true levels of unemployment, a record 35 million people are  our of work in the OECD. The real figure would be nearer 50 million or more,  particularly if we add the &ldquo;discouraged&rdquo; workers who have given up looking for  a job.</p>
<p>
Unemployment in the European Union (EU) has increased inexorably over the  past two decades from 2.4% in 1970, to 6% in 1980, to almost 12% at present.  (about 20 million people&#8212;roughly the population of Greece and Portugal  combined). In the USA, 6.5% are out of work and in Japan, too, unemployment is  rising for the first time in decades. In fact, many economists consider that  the true rate of unemployment in Japan is not the official 2.5% but nearer 10%.  Bear in mind that unemployment in Japan has not exceeded 3% since the Second  World War. Now all that is about to change.</p>
<p>
The main point is that this unemployment is qualitatively different to  anything we have seen since 1945. This is not &ldquo;cyclical&rdquo; unemployment which  rises and falls with the normal trade cycle of capitalism. It is not even the &ldquo;reserve  army of unemployed&rdquo; which, as Marx explains, is a necessary feature of  capitalism.</p>
<p>
This is a permanent, organic, or as the bourgeois economists call it, &ldquo;structural&rdquo;  unemployment. The system is no longer able to absorb the large numbers of  workers who enter the labour market each year. On the contrary, it cannot even  keep in employment those who are already at work.</p>
<p>
Even in periods of booms, like the boom of 1982-90, the capitalists behave  like Luddites, destroying the means of production, closing down factories and  throwing large numbers of workers onto the streets. In periods of slump, this  situation gets worse. But even when the economy finally picks up, it is unable  to reabsorb them. </p>
<p>
Unemployment is a cancer which gnaws at the bowels of society. The  atrocious waste represented by unemployment is shown by the fact that we are  currently losing (on official figures) the equivalent of 35 million man-years  of production every year.</p>
<p>
In addition to this, the money spent on unemployment benefit and social  security, insufficient as it is, serves to aggravate the problem of budget  deficits which plague all Western governments. Since they cannot just let 35  million people and their dependants starve to death (not out of any charitable  feeling, but because of fear of the social and political consequences), the  capitalists are compelled to pay out huge sums of money for people not to work.</p>
<p>
In the words of the Communist Manifesto, the bourgeoisie is &ldquo;unfit to rule  because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slaves within its  slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state, that it has  to feed him, instead of being fed by him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Like some uncontrollable and terrifying epidemic, unemployment strikes the  young and old, men and women, black and white, educated and uneducated, skilled  and unskilled. Even the managerial strata, professional people and white collar  workers who never thought they would be out of work&#8212;find themselves  unceremoniously thrown on the scrap heap in the prime of life. For many 40 year  olds (and even younger people) who lose their jobs now may never find work  again. </p>
<p>
As The Economist (7/7/93) put it: &ldquo;Many who toiled long and hard to climb a  career ladder are, indeed, finding that the rungs are falling away under their  feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The capitalists have no answer to the problem of unemployment. The old  Keynesian recipes have been shown to be bankrupt. The huge budget deficits  which exist in all capitalist countries (except Japan, for special reasons)  means that deficit financing and &ldquo;pump priming&rdquo; to artificially boost demand  through state expenditure is ruled out. </p>
<p>
The dominant wing of the bourgeois have unceremoniously ditched the old  Keynesian nostrums (which were, let us recall, supposed to have provided the  definitive answer to Marxism).</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;In the 1930s, when jobless rates soared above 20% in America and Britain,  a British economist, John Maynard Keynes, argued that the cure for unemployment  was to stimulate demand by increasing public spending or cutting taxes. In the  1950s and 1960s Keynesian demand management seemed to do the trick.  Unemployment stayed low. But since the early 1970s, it has ratcheted up in each  cycle. An increasing proportion of unemployment is clearly structural.&rdquo; (The  Economist, 12/2/92).</p>
<p>
The fact is that, even in the event of a shaky recovery which seems likely  in the next period, unemployment will not noticeably go down in most countries.  It will remain an ugly and chronic ulcer, sapping the strength of society.</p>
<p>
The Daily Express of February 11th 1994, in a article on the dire position  of Britain&rsquo;s manufacturing sector pointed out that more than 360,000 jobs had  been lost in the industry during the recession in the three years to 1993, and  that a further 47,000 were forecast to disappear in 1994, precisely in a period  of recovery of the British economy. It goes on to predict that:</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Even though the industry is expanding, engineering companies will continue  to cut workforces as new technologies force out the unskilled.&rdquo; And this is no  exception, but the rule, and not only in Britain. In 1993, nearly half the  unemployed in Europe had been out of work for a year or more, with little or no  prospect for improvement.</p>
<p>
The situation in Japan, where until recently most workers thought that  their jobs were guaranteed for life, is no better. Although the overall  unemployment figures seem low by comparison with Europe, the underlying trend  is sharply up. The Economist (18/12/93) points out that the number of full-time  jobs in Japan increased over the year to October 1993 by a mere 0.1%. But since  the workforce is growing by 0.5% a year, unemployment continues to increase: &ldquo;The  number of people registered as unemployed is up 20% on last year. Until  September 1992, job vacancies outnumbered jobs seekers: now there are 67  openings per 100 job seekers,&rdquo; and the article concludes pessimistically: &ldquo;Unless  the yen falls along with Japan&rsquo;s trade surplus, the present troubles may soon  seem mild.&rdquo; In fact, the yen has risen, and Japan&rsquo;s crisis has gone from bad to  worse.</p>
<h4>Machinery and the Working Day</h4>
<p>
Those of us with long enough memories can remember the days when the &ldquo;experts&rdquo;  promised us a glorious vista of the future when, on the basis of applied  science and technology, the burden of work would be done away with, hours  reduced and the central problem of society would be what to do with our leisure  time.</p>
<p>
How ironic these arguments sound today! While million of unemployed  languish in conditions of enforced &ldquo;leisure,&rdquo; other millions with the good luck  to remain at work find themselves subjected to ever-increasing pressures to  work longer hours with lower pay and worse conditions. and to spend the maximum  exertions of their nervous system and muscle-power in the cause of greater &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;  (read: &ldquo;profitability&rdquo;).</p>
<p>
Yet, in truth, all the earlier predictions concerning the possibility for  reducing the working day were correct. The potential for a universal reduction  in working hours&#8212;and thereby the abolition of unemployment&#8212;is implicit in  the spectacular advance of technology in the past few decades.</p>
<p>
Let us consider the implication of industrial robots. There are 500,000 of  these machines in the world at the present time. Japan, with just 0.3% of the  surface of the world, and 2.5% of its population, possesses more than 300,000  of the total&#8212;double the number of five years ago.</p>
<p>
In the USA, the number of robots has grown by 50% in the same period,  according to figures published by the McKinsey Global Institute. Italy, France,  Spain and other countries have likewise increased their number of robots.</p>
<p>
The introduction of these machines means that the number of workers in a  factory can be drastically reduced, while the productivity of those who remain,  vastly enhanced by machinery, registers a substantial increase.</p>
<p>
In France, for example, the two major car manufacturers have reduced their  workforce by no fewer than 200,000 over the past twelve years, with an  increased productivity of 12% in the same period. Similarly, the Peugeot  factory in Spain reduced its 12,000 workforce by half over the last decade.</p>
<p>
The same technology can be applied to many other fields&#8212;the  transformation of plastics, for example, or the textile industry. Even in the  food industry, such operations as the packaging of cheese is done by robots,  which can also be used to eliminate human participation in dangerous  occupations. Robots mean greater quality, more flexibility in production, and  speed.</p>
<p>
The universal application of such technology in the context of a rational  and harmonious plan of production, with the democratic involvement of the  workers at all levels, would signify a complete transformation of the life of  society.</p>
<p>
The working week could immediately be reduced to a four day, thirty  two-hour week without loss of pay, and at the same time production could be  rapidly increased both in quantity and quality. Thereafter, the working day  could be steadily reduced, thus providing the material conditions for such a  flourishing of democracy, art, science and culture as the world has never seen.</p>
<p>
This is precisely the material basis for socialism&#8212;a new and  qualitatively higher form of human society. These are not utopian day-dreams,  but conclusions which flow logically and inevitably from the present state of  knowledge and the actual demands of the productive forces.</p>
<p>
And yet, at every step reality knocks its head against the potential of  production and technique. Instead of a world of leisure and self-fulfilment, we  have a social nightmare of mass &ldquo;structural&rdquo; unemployment on the one hand and  relentless, inhuman squeezing of labour power on the other. How to explain such  a crying contradiction?</p>

<h4>Marx&rsquo;s &ldquo;Capital&rdquo;</h4>
<p>
In the first volume of Capital, Marx explains that the introduction of  machinery under capitalism necessarily means a lengthening of the working day.  The purpose of employing machinery is to cheapen the product by economising on  labour.</p>
<p>
However, there is a contradiction implicit in this. The profits of the  capitalist are extracted from the unpaid labour of the working class. The  increase in the productivity of labour made possible by the introduction of  machinery is achieved by a heavy initial outlay on costly machinery which, in  themselves, add no new value to the end product, but merely import to it, over  a period, bit by bit, their own value:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Machinery, like every other component of constant capital, creates no new  value, but yields up its own value to the product that it serves to beget.&rdquo;  (Vol. 1, p387)</p>
<p>
The only way to ensure a greater return on this outlay, is to make his  machinery work non-stop, day and night, with no interruptions, while  simultaneously squeezing every atom of surplus value from the worker, both by  lengthening the working day through overtime, the abolition of tea-breaks, etc.  (&ldquo;absolute surplus value&rdquo;), and by enormously increasing the intensity of  labour by speed-ups, productivity deals and all kinds of pressure (&ldquo;relative  surplus value&rdquo;).</p>
<p>
Thus, as Marx explains, &ldquo;machinery, while augmenting the human material  that forms the principal object of capital&rsquo;s exploiting power, at the same time  raises the degree of exploitation.&rdquo; (Vol. 1, p395) And again: &ldquo;If machinery be  the most powerful means for increasing the productiveness of labour&#8212;i.e. for  shortening the working-time required in the production of a commodity, it  becomes in the hands of capital the most powerful means, in those countries  first invaded by it, for lengthening the working-day beyond all bounds set by  human nature.&rdquo; (Vol. 1, p403)</p>
<p>
Competition, the constant revolutionising of the productive forces and  techniques, the desire to &ldquo;corner the market&rdquo; and get an advantage over others,  were the factors which, in the past at least, compelled the capitalist  constantly to re-invest in expensive machinery.</p>
<p>
However, once having introduced new machinery, it is in the capitalist&rsquo;s  interest to use it to the maximum. It cannot be allowed to stand idle for an  instant, partly because it deteriorates, and partly because it can quickly  become obsolete. That is why, under capitalism, the introduction of machinery  leads to greater exploitation and an increase in the working day.</p>
<p>
The introduction of new technology to a given branch of production means  that in that branch, for a time, huge super-profits can be earned. Later,  however, the other capitalists catch up and the rate of profit is levelled out.</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the amount of surplus value obtained by the capitalist depends  upon two things: a) the rate of surplus value and b) the number of workers  employed. However, the introduction of machinery tends to reduce the number of  workers and therefore change the ratio of variable to constant capital.  Machinery (constant capital), as we have seen, does not add any new value to  the final product above and beyond what is already present in it. &ldquo;Hence, the  application of machinery to the production of surplus value,&rdquo; Marx explains, &ldquo;implies  a contradiction which is immanent in it.&rdquo; (Vol. 1, p407) </p>
<h4>The Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall</h4>
<p>
In the Grundrisse, Marx refers to the tendency of the rate of profit to  fall as &ldquo;the most important law in modern political economy.&rdquo; Nevertheless,  Marx never considered this as an absolute phenomenon. In the third volume of  Capital, he explains the tendencies which served to counteract this law. For  example, Marx points out that the intensification of exploitation (&ldquo;relative  surplus value&rdquo;) can restore the rate of profit, and also the tendency to  cheapen the price of commodities, including machinery. We have seen precisely  these factors operating in the recent period, as the capitalist attempt to  increase their profit margins by squeezing every atom of surplus value from the  sweat and nervous strain of their workers.</p>
<p>
In other words, what we are dealing with is only a tendency which manifests  itself over the whole history of capitalist development. Nevertheless, there  can be long periods&#8212;even decades&#8212;in which the tendency of the rate of  profit to fall is cancelled out by the counteracting tendencies already  mentioned.</p>
<p>
In his book The Current Crisis written in 1987, Mark Glick publishes the  following figures for the long-term rate of profit in the United States:</p>

<p class="fst">1899&#8212;22% 1939&#8212;7%<br />
1914-18&#8212;18% 1945&#8212;23%<br />
1921&#8212;12% 1948&#8212;17%<br />
1929&#8212;17% 1965&#8212;18%<br />
1932&#8212;2% 1983&#8212;10%</p>
<p>
  Thus, from an historical point of view, we see that, leaving aside the  inevitable cyclical fluctuations, the rate of profit now is lower than it was a  hundred years ago. However, for whole periods this tendency has been reversed.</p>
<p>
  If we take the figures for the main capitalist countries during the period  of the post-war upswing, when colossal sums were spent on new plant and  machinery, the tendency of the rate of profit to fall is clearly revealed:</p>

<p>
  The slight discrepancies between these figures and Glick&rsquo;s are due to the  fact that the statistics are often evaluated differently. However, the  important thing is the trend, which is quite clear.</p>
<p>
  In the subsequent period, particularly the 1980s, this tendency was sharply  reversed, as the capitalists of all countries took steps to restore the rate of  profit. This was mainly done by drastically increasing the rate of  exploitation. Employers took advantage of the huge &ldquo;shakeout&rdquo; of the early  1980s to squeeze extra surplus value from the workers who remained in  employment. This was particularly true in Britain and the USA.</p>
<p>
  In general, the boom of 1982-90 represented the weakest investment cycle  since the Second World War. Only in Japan and Germany was there a significant  increase in capital investment. In the United States, investment in productive  industry remained weak in comparison to the booms of the past. On the other  hand, merciless pressure was exerted on the American workers to keep wages down  and boost profit margins. </p>
<p>
  By such means, the capitalists have succeeded in partially restoring the  rate of profit. But even so, the rate of profit is still far less than it was  in the &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of the 1950s and early 1960s. Nevertheless, the capitalists  can accept, for a time, a reduced rate of profit, provided the mass of profit  is maintained. </p>
<p>
  Some people imagined that a new period of capitalist expansion would be  guaranteed by the opening of new fields of investment in the &ldquo;information  revolution.&rdquo; This illusion has been rapidly shattered. The computer and  software market has also rapidly reached saturation. In two years, the cost of  personal computers fell by half, and the price of related products&#8212; spreadsheets, word processors, databases and the rest, is being dragged down  after it.</p>
<p>
  In point of fact, this new area of production is a classic case which  illustrates the correctness of Marx&rsquo;s economic theories. The costs of  developing complex new products are huge. Microsoft&rsquo;s Access database alone  cost about $60m. This can only be offset by a rapid increase in market share  and a huge volume of sales.</p>
<p>
  However, with the appearance of overproduction and falling prices, profit  margins have begun to fall. In the quarter to September 1993, Borland&rsquo;s net  profit margin sank to 2.6% of sales, down 4.2% a year earlier. The equivalent  figures for Lotus were 7% and 14.6%. Even Microsoft anticipates a fall in its  net profit margin to around 15% from falling sales of application software.</p>
<p>
  The capitalists can, for a time, tolerate the tendency of the rate of  profit to decline, on condition that the mass of profit is maintained.</p>
<p>
  As we have pointed out, the Japanese capitalists for decades have led the  world in investment in new machinery and technology. The long-term decline in  the profitability of Japanese industry is a well-documented fact.</p>
<p>
  Between late 1986 and early 1991, capital investment in Japan accounted for  two-thirds of GNP growth. According to investment experts Smithers and Co, the  current slump in business investment in Japan is directly related to this  phenomenon; the graph shows a continuing decline of the rate of return on  physical capital: &ldquo;it takes more and more investment to deliver a given  increase in output. This fact has its counterpart in Japan&rsquo;s declining  long-term growth rate.&rdquo; Before the &ldquo;oil crisis&rdquo; of 1974, the trend growth of  real GNP was nearly 9%. Then it declined to 4%. One of the factors in this was &ldquo;that  the return on investment has declined sharply. Business investment became even  less profitable in the most recent capital-spending binge.&rdquo; (The Economist,  29/5/93).</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;Experience in Europe and America suggests that a ratio of capital spending  to GNP of about 12-15% is typical for a mature economy. Japan&rsquo;s ratio peaked at  22% in 1991. Since then companies such as Toyota have announced steep  reductions in investment. But capital spending still accounted for 20.5% of GNP  in 1992. Further severe cuts seem inevitable, with consequences for both  employment and consumer confidence, Smithers and Co. expects capital spending  to fall by almost half before this adjustment is complete.&rdquo; (Ibid)</p>
<p>
  All the big Japanese companies have seen their profits slashed. In the six  months to September 1992, Matsushita (the world&rsquo;s biggest electronic  manufacturer) experienced a fall of 66% in pretax profits, NEC, 71%, Mazda,  72%, Nippon Steel, 74%. The average drop in pretax profits was 36%. Nissan saw  its first ever loss since it was quoted on the stock exchange in 1951&#8212;a total  of $114 million.</p>
<p>
  The result? Factories mothballed, wages frozen, bonuses paid in unsold  goods and, for the first time in decades, Japanese workers sacked. In other  words, the much-vaunted &ldquo;Japanese model&rdquo; has finally collapsed.</p>
<p>
  The aggressive exporting methods of Japanese companies are part of an  attempt to restore profitability by intensive participation on the world market.  On the other hand, together with massive investment in the most modern  machinery, the Japanese capitalists have developed new techniques and working  practices designed to squeeze the maximum productivity from the workers. Thus,  the Nissan plant in Sunderland produces 80 cars per worker per year (the same  as in Japan) compared to an average of about 45 cars in the European car  industry. However, both the stepping up of pressure on the workers and the  attempt to find a way out of the crisis through exports come up against  insuperable barriers.</p>
<p>
  One of the ultimate causes of capitalist crisis is over-production. The  working class can never purchase the total product of its labour. The  capitalists cannot increase wages to the point where its surplus value is eliminated,  since the pursuit of surplus value is the motor-force of the entire system.  Other things being equal, if the real wages of the working class increase, the  capitalists&rsquo; profits will fall, producing a collapse of investments, the  life-blood of the system.</p>
<p>
  In the recent period we have seen a ferocious struggle to push down real  wages, while simultaneously forcing up the productivity of labour. In the  United States, for example, real wages have not risen in twenty years. In  British manufacturing industry, the workforce has been reduced from six million  to four million over the past decade, yet the level of production remains the  same. And this has been achieved without the massive introduction of new  machinery, which would have been a progressive development.</p>
<p>
  However, the relentless squeezing of the workers to achieve higher rates of  profit is reaching its limits. There is a point beyond which the workers&rsquo;  physical ability to produce cannot go. The drive to go beyond these limits will  inevitably produce an explosion.</p>
<p>
  Even leaving this out of account, from a strictly economic point of view,  the continuing &ldquo;shake-out&rdquo; of workers from the factories creates new  contradictions. On the one hand, the rise in unemployment reduces demand and  thereby deepens the crisis. On the other hand, since surplus value can only be  produced by human labour, at a certain point the expulsion of workers from the  factories must lead eventually to a fall, not only in the rate of profit, but  in the mass of profit.</p>
<p>
  The attempt to find a solution by increased participation in world markets  also has a limit, insofar as the capitalists of all countries are attempting to  do the same thing.</p>
<p>
  Compared to these points, the trusts of Marx&rsquo;s day were mere child&rsquo;s play.  The The only solution is to attack the workers&rsquo; living standards. We see this  tendency in all countries at the present time. However, this merely gives rise  to new contradictions. To the extent that they succeed in cutting wages, on the  basis of the &ldquo;need to be competitive&rdquo; in one country, the competitive advantage  will be cancelled out, all the capitalist countries will be back to square one,  but the masses of all nations will be worse off.</p>
<p>
  The attempt to solve the problem by increased participation on world  markets has led to an ever fiercer struggle between the USA, Europe and Japan.  Such is the sharpness of the conflict that, in any other historical period, it  would have already led to war. In the modern epoch, for reasons explained by  the Marxists in the past, a world war between the main imperialist nations is  virtually ruled out (although &ldquo;small&rdquo; wars such as the Gulf War and the  Yugoslav conflict are inevitable). Instead, we have the threat of trade wars,  and the increasing division of the world into rival blocs, dominated by the  USA, Japan and Western Europe.</p>
<p>
  The ferocious struggle for competitive advantage, the desperate attempt to  boost profit margins, means that each national capitalist class will seek to  put extra pressure on its workers. Wages, hours, conditions, social reforms,  trade union rights&#8212;all the gains of the past&#8212;are under attack. This is a  recipe for class struggle.</p>
<h4>Concentration of Capital</h4>
<p>
  It is ironic that, precisely in this epoch, when the entire world economy  is dominated by huge multinationals, the apologists of capital try to show that  the future lies with small enterprises, or, to use their favourite  catch-phrase, &ldquo;small is beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  This wishful thinking is like the day-dreams of a decrepit old libertine  who tries to forget his present ailments by recalling the vigour of youth.  However, the youthful phase of capitalism is gone beyond recall.</p>
<p>
  Marx explains how free competition inevitably begets monopoly. In the  struggle between big and small capital, the result is always the same: &ldquo;It  always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass  into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish.&rdquo; (K. Marx, Capital, Vol. 1,  p. 626)</p>
<p>
  Today, the vast power of the monopolies and multinationals exercises a  total stranglehold on the world. With the access to staggering sums of money,  their economies of scale, their ability to manipulate commodity prices and even  their power to determine the policy of governments, they are the true masters  of the planet.</p>
<p>
  The brilliance of Marx&rsquo;s method is shown precisely from the fact that he  was able to predict the inevitable tendency towards monopolisation when &ldquo;free  competition&rdquo; was still the norm.</p>
<p>
  Nowadays, despite the demagogic twaddle of journals like The Economist  about &ldquo;small is beautiful,&rdquo; there can be no question of this general historical  tendency being reversed. Quite the contrary. The last few decades have  witnessed an unprecedented tendency towards the concentration of capital.</p>
<p>
  The broad historical tendency towards the concentration of capital is absolutely  incontrovertible. If we take the percentage of total assets held by companies  in the United States, for example, we get the following result:  </p>

  At the present moment in time, no less than nine-tenths of the US economy  is in the hands of the top 500 companies, and 80% of that is in the hands of  the 100 biggest. A US Senate report of 1980 further revealed that the  controlling interests of the stocks of these companies was in the hands of just  two dozen big financial institutions. In turn, these companies are controlled  by each other. For example, over a third of the shares of Citibank were held by  just twenty-four of its leading &ldquo;competitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  The figures for Britain are no less illuminating. Let us take the  percentage share of the largest 100 firms in manufacturing:  </p>

<p>The situation as regards Germany is no different. In 1982, firms with over  200 employees accounted for only 11.9%. By 1991 it was 45.1%.</p>
<p>
  Small may or may not be &ldquo;beautiful,&rdquo; but the plain fact is that firms with  over 500 employees overwhelmingly predominate in all major capitalist economies  as against small enterprises, accounting for 49% of manufacturing in France,  66% in Britain, 60% in West Germany and a staggering 71% in the USA.</p>
<p>
  The only exception is Japan, with 33%, but this is more apparent than real,  since the large number of small firms are heavily dependent on the monopolies,  and really represent auxiliaries of the industrial giants. At the present time,  Japanese small firms are going bust at the rate of more that 1,000 each month.  A similar position exists in Europe.</p>
<p>
  An editorial in The Economist (18/7/92) points out that &ldquo;there were 3.6%  million more small and middle-sized enterprises in the European Union in 1989  at the start of the decade.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Now the gap is back, and widening. Many small firms have collapsed as  economies stagnated and the share prices of the survivors have done less well  than those of the big companies. Banks have cut their lending.&rdquo; And this is the  voice of the journal which used to wax lyrical about the small and medium firms  which were allegedly going to represent the future of the &ldquo;free market economy&rdquo;! </p>
<p>
  Yet these figures do not tell the whole story. In the recent period,  especially during the boom of the 1980s, the tendency towards the concentration  of capital has been enormously accelerated, as the big monopolies made huge  fortunes out of take-over bids, often accompanied by all kinds of fraud and  corrupt practices&#8212;leverage bids, junk bonds, asset stripping, insider  dealing, and so on. This kind of speculative fever, the urge to &ldquo;make a fast  buck&rdquo; out of non-productive activity, and not at all the creation of real  wealth through investment, is what characterises the present period of  capitalism.</p>
<p>
  In Britain, where the capitalist class has operated in an entirely  parasitical way for years, the &ldquo;merger-mania&rdquo; revealed itself in a particularly  crude way throughout the &ldquo;Thatcher decade,&rdquo; coinciding with the wholesale  dismantling of manufacturing industry. Thus, in 1979 there were 534 takeovers,  with a total value of &pound;71.6 billion. By 1987, that figure had risen to a staggering 1,125, with a  total value of &pound;715.5 billion&#8212;ten times as many.</p>
<p>
  The same phenomenon can be seen on a global scale. In the first nine months  of 1990, the number of world-wide mergers and acquisitions stood at 6,883. The  following year, despite the recession, the corresponding figure was still  6,151. The process of the concentration of capital proceeds apace, despite all  the propaganda about &ldquo;free enterprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  In Britain, fifty big companies control 90% of international trade. On a  different level, one third of world trade is in the hands of giant  multinationals with truly staggering sums of capital at their disposal. The  speculative movement of this capital around the world can make or break  governments. The power of the big monopolies was revealed by the crisis of the  European Monetary System (EMS), when the manipulation of billions in the  international money markets compelled the devaluation of the pound, the lira,  the peseta, and other currencies.</p>
<p>
  In the period of capitalist ascent, the bourgeois played a progressive role  in developing the productive forces, investing in industry, science and  technology. In the epoch of capitalist decline, we see a very different picture  emerging. Speculative activity and investment in the parasitic service sector  is displacing investment in productive activity as a source of profit. When  huge fortunes can be made by a single telephone call by a currency speculator,  why bother to risk capital in costly machinery which may never make a profit?</p>
<p>
  Gambling on the stock exchange has reached epidemic proportions. Nearly  $200 billion a year goes to finance speculative takeovers in the United States  alone. While factories were being continuously closed, in the period 1989-91  more than half of world-wide investment was dedicated to services. While part  of this was of a productive character (transport and other parts of the  productive infrastructure which is incorrectly included under the heading of &ldquo;services&rdquo;  by the bourgeois analysts), the majority, from junk-food shops to banking and  insurance, was parasitic and non-productive.</p>
<p>
  Every day about $1,000 billion exchanges hands on the foreign exchange  markets. Yet only 5-7% of this represents real production and exchange deals.  The rest is made up of massive speculation in international currencies, where  fortunes are made in a matter of hours without the need for any productive  activity, whatsoever.</p>
<p>
  To understand the explosive growth is speculative activity, between 1980  and 1990, the volume of world-wide cross-border transactions in equities  increased at a compound rate of 28% a year, from $120 billion to $1.4 trillion  a year. Currency trading has grown by more than a third since April 1989, when  a central bank survey estimated net daily turnover at $650 billion&#8212;and that  was double the previous survey&rsquo;s estimate for 1986.</p>
<p>
  The vast sums of money handled by the big banks, and used mainly for  speculative purposes, is shown by the following figures. In 1980, the level of  international lending (including domestic deals in foreign currency) was $324  billion. By 1991, despite the sharp cut-back in lending to Third World  countries, as a result of the debt crisis, that figure had increased to a  staggering $7.5 trillion.</p>
<p>
  To give an idea of the meaning of these figures, it is necessary to remind  ourselves that in 1980, the combined gross domestic product of the 24 OECD  countries (the entire developed capitalist world) was $7.6 trillion. In 1991 it  was $17.1 trillion. So in one decade, the stock of international bank lending  rose from 4% of total OECD GDP to 44%.</p>
<p>
  These figures give a true picture of the power of the big banks and  monopolies on a world scale. At the last count, in 1990, there were  approximately 35,000 &ldquo;transnational corporations&rdquo; with 147,000 foreign  affiliates. However, in reality, a handful of giant monopolies predominate. The  parasitic and speculative character of these monopolies explains why the boom  of 1982-90 had an entirely different character to the post-war upswing.</p>
<p>
  Benjamin Friedman of Harvard University points out that between 1980 and  1989:</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;Corporations were borrowing not to invest but to finance transactions&#8212; including mergers, acquisitions, stock repurchases and leveraged buy-outs&#8212; that merely paid down their own or other corporation&rsquo;s equity. As a result, the  corporate sector&rsquo;s aggregate net worth declined by more than one-fourth  compared to the size of the economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Marx explains that the bourgeois in the end are dealing in &ldquo;phantom figures&rdquo;&#8212;interest and speculative activities which would swallow up the whole  production of the world. The statistics show that the fever of speculation  vastly exceeds the actual level of production on a world scale. Marx also  warned that this process cannot be prolonged indefinitely, but as we now see in  Japan, inevitably leads to a collapse of production, once the speculative  bubble is burst.</p>
<p>
  The destiny of million of human beings is in the hands of these monstrous  monopolies, guided purely and simply by the predatory instinct to make &ldquo;easy  money&rdquo; by non-productive means. The collapse of the EMS and the permanent  instability of world finance markets are a graphic illustration of this power,  which is an additional factor for instability, threatening at any time to  engulf the world in a new financial crisis, which, given the precarious and  unsound state of world capitalism, could end in a deep slump.</p>
<p class="quote">&ldquo;To put it at its mildest, governments have no grounds for complacency  about the risk of another depression. Today&rsquo;s financial markets are more than  capable of assembling the preconditions, and economic policy may not be able to  cope if the do...</p>
<p class="quote">&ldquo;Global capital flows are one of the biggest reasons to fear that a  financial upset might cause a deep, worldwide recession.&rdquo; (The Economist,  19/9/92).</p>
<h4>Overproduction and Slumps</h4>
<p>
  The sickness of the system is shown by the phenomenon of excess capacity  which affects all the main capitalist economies. In Marx&rsquo;s day, the crisis of  capitalism manifested itself in periodic crises of over-production. Under  modern conditions, the big monopolies have the necessary technology to  calculate in advance the available market for their products. Therefore, they  have tended to reduce production before getting to the point of actual  over-production.</p>
<p>
  The fact that the capitalists are not capable of fully utilising the  productive capacity even in a boom is a graphic illustration of the Marxist  assertion that the productive forces have grown beyond the narrow limits of  private ownership and the nation state.</p>
<p>
  However, the situation at the present time is even worse. Instead of excess  capacity we see the re-appearance of actual over-production in a number of  areas, not only agriculture, where the &ldquo;food mountains&rdquo; appear as an obscene  insult to the starving millions in the Third World, but cars, computers and  many other commodities.</p>
<p>
  In the Communist Manifesto, written in 1847, Marx and Engels accurately  described the kind of crisis which we now see:</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;In these crises a great part not only of the existing products, but also  of the previously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed. In  these crises there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would  have seemed an absurdity&#8212;the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly  finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism: it appears as if a  famine, a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of  subsistence: industry and commerce seem to be destroyed and why? Because there  is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too  much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend  to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the  contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are  fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring disorder into  the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property.  The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth  created by them. And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one  hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by  the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old  ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive  crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.&rdquo; (Marx and  Engels, Selected Works, Vol.1, pp.113-4). </p>
<p>
  These lines are as fresh and relevant today as when they were written, over  140 years ago.</p>
<p>
  Just take the state of the car industry, where hundreds of thousands of  workers have been thrown on the scrap heap because the market is saturated. The  Japanese car makers had obtained a big advantage over their foreign rivals  partly on the basis of investing in modern technology, partly by a more  ruthless and &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; squeezing of relative surplus value from their  workers.</p>
<p>
  The Japanese monopolies, with their strong emphasis on modern machinery,  were prepared to put up with a relatively low rate of return on investment,  made up by a greater volume of sales through exports.</p>
<p>
  However, most families in Japan, the USA and Western Europe now possess at  least one television, a car, a video, hi-fi equipment, etc. The tendency to  expand the market artificially through credit has reached its limits, leading  to a general crisis of debt.</p>
<p>
  In this situation, there has been a fall, not of the rate, but of the mass  of profit. In the past, every Japanese car made 83,000 yen in profit. The  figure is now about 15,000 yen. Moreover, Japanese car manufacturers had  developed a productive capacity based upon the assumption of a 10-15% market  growth every year. In fact, market growth has been at most 2-3% in the recent  past.</p>
<p>
  Western Europe&rsquo;s car market declined by 16% in volume terms in 1993, giving  rise to a vicious price war between car companies trying to dump their surplus  products. Only the biggest and most powerful companies can survive in such a  situation, and not all of them.</p>
<p>
  The Economist (5/2/94) explained the seriousness of the position: </p>

  &ldquo;The underlying proof of the European car industry&rsquo;s problems is surplus  manufacturing capacity of about 2 million cars a year. If all Europe&rsquo;s plants  were manned and equipped to run at full stretch, the overcapacity could be 3.5  million cars a year.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Living Standards</h4>
<p>
  For a period of almost four decades after the Second World War the  capitalist system experienced a new lease of life for reasons outlined above.  This was reflected in increasing living standards for a large part of the  population in the advanced capitalist countries. </p>
<p>
  In the Introduction to the Living Thoughts of Karl Marx, Trotsky deals with  the so-called &ldquo;theory of increasing misery,&rdquo; which the bourgeois critics of  Marx have utilised to try to discredit Marxism, pointing triumphantly to the  increased living standards of the workers of the West in comparison to the  past.</p>
<p>
  However, Marx never denied that, under certain conditions, wages could  rise. Such an assertion would be utterly childish. On the contrary, he went to  some lengths to explain how wages inevitably rise in certain periods of  capitalist development, and fall in others. But even in the most prosperous  periods of capitalism, the relative improvement of living standards can never  abolish surplus value, and can never change the social position of the worker:</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;But just as little as better clothing, food and treatment, and a larger  peculium (a slave&rsquo;s allowance&#8212;EG and AW), do away with the exploitation of  the slave, so little do they set aside that of the wage-worker. A rise in the  price of labour, as a consequence of accumulation of capital, only means, in  fact, that the length and weight of the golden chain the wage-worker has  already forged for himself, allow of a relaxation of the tension of it.&rdquo; (K.  Marx, Capital, Vol. 1, p. 618)</p>
<p>
  When the capitalists are making super-profits from the labour of the  working class, when demand is rising and order-books are full, and when the  workers feel strong enough to combine, through their trade unions, to demand an  increased share in the product of their labour-power, then the capitalist can agree  to part with some of the booty.</p>
<p>
  At best, an increase in wages in a favourable period would signify a  relative reduction in the amount on unpaid labour &ldquo;given&rdquo; by the worker to the  capitalist. What it can never mean is the abolition of exploitation. On the  contrary, a growth in wages is frequently accompanied by an increase in the  rate of exploitation, and a relative worsening of the position of the worker  vis vis the capitalist.</p>
<p>
  Workers are generally interested in the amount of cash they receive in wages,  and what it can buy. They are not so conscious of the amount of labour they  give in return, in the form of overtime, productivity deals and the rest of it.  As long as the money is there at the end of the week, workers can, for a time  at least, put up with a killing pace of work, which undermines their health,  family and social life. Nor are they aware that, while their wages are  increasing absolutely, the profits of the bosses are increasing relatively even  more.</p>
<p>
  The fact that a worker can afford to buy a television or a second-hand car  (on credit) does not alter his or her position vis a vis the capitalist. Above  all in the period of monopoly capitalism, the idea that a worker can &ldquo;better  himself&rdquo; by working hard is a farcical illusion.</p>
<p>
  Marx referred to the tendency of capitalism to depend increasingly on the  labour of women and children. Nowadays, child labour is supposed to have been  abolished in the advanced capitalist countries. Nevertheless, it still enters  into the composition of capital through the products of the Third World, where  extensive and horrific exploitation of children still exists.</p>
<p>
  However, the exploitation of women and young people is an important and  growing factor in the economic life of advanced capitalist countries. How many  working-class families could maintain their present standard of living without  wives, sons and daughters contributing to the household income with the income  from low-paid jobs?</p>
<p>
  Under modern conditions of production, sheer physical strength is  frequently less important than agile minds and hands. This means the  possibility of widespread exploitation of women and young people, usually taken  on at low wages on the basis of part-time employment means that the clock is  being put back a hundred years.</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;Women still account for a lamentably small share of senior jobs; but lower  down the ladder, things are different. In Britain, the number of women in work  has increased by 18% since the late 1970&rsquo;s, while male employment has fallen by  7%. Britain now has almost as many female employees as male ones, though many  are part-timers. In America, too, women have taken the larger share of America&rsquo;s  new jobs since the late 1970&rsquo;s. On current trends, a &lsquo;typical&rsquo; worker in  America and Britain will be a woman by early in the next century.&rdquo; (The  Economist, 11/12/93).</p>
<p>
  The participation of women in the productive process is the prior condition  for their emancipation from the narrow confines of the home. The entry of women  workers into the ranks of industry represents a new and vital source of  strength for the working class and the labour movement. However, despite the  boastful tone of this bourgeois editorial writer, the crude reality of female  labour, now as in Marx&rsquo;s time, is one of blatant exploitation in every sense of  the word.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The rise in female employment is welcome&#8212;both for the new employees and  for the economy as a whole,&rdquo; gloats the leader writer. But then he lets the cat  out of the bag: &ldquo;Nonetheless, the slump in demand for unskilled labour and the  influx of female workers have combined to depress pay for unskilled and  part-time jobs. Men are less willing to work for very low pay.&rdquo; (The Economist,  11/12/93). </p>
<p>
  Incidentally, the same Tory hypocrites who bewail the rise in crime and  anti-social behaviour among young people and the &ldquo;decline of the Family&rdquo;  allegedly caused by women working, turn a blind eye to the effect of capitalist  crisis on the family. &ldquo;Relate&rdquo;, the marriage guidance charity, reports a 50%  increase in its workload over the past five years. Unemployment and mounting  debts are having a &ldquo;devastating effect on family life,&rdquo; it says.</p>
<p>
  Thus, even in the best period, the rise in living standards is accompanied  by increased exploitation, by a relative decline in the workers&rsquo; position  relative to the capitalists, and by the super-exploitation of women and young  people in low-paid jobs which are increasingly of a casual or temporary  character.</p>
<p>
  However, the illusion of &ldquo;prosperity&rdquo; is now being rapidly undermined. The inexorable  spread of unemployment means that even the relative gains of the past, the  little pleasures which afford some consolation, which make life more civilised,  are threatened. Not only these things, but even the roof over people&rsquo;s head can  be taken away almost at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Thus, society is afflicted by an  increasing sense of insecurity and malaise.</p>
<p>
  All the gains of the past are under threat, as the capitalists try to boost  their profit margins at the expense of the working class and the poorest  sections of society. The unemployed, the aged, the sick are faced with the  continuous attacks on the welfare state. Those workers who are &ldquo;fortunate&rdquo;  enough to have a job are faced with a general assault on wages and conditions.</p>
<p>
  In Britain, which once boasted one of the most developed welfare systems,  the Tory government has abolished the Wages Councils, established by Winston  Churchill in 1910, which were intended to protect the wages of millions of  low-paid workers. Everywhere, the employers take advantage of anti-trade union  laws to push down wages. </p>
<p>
  A recent report by Dr. Neil Millward of the Policy Studies Institute,  commissioned by the government&rsquo;s Department of Employment provoked the  Financial Times (15/2/94) to comment: &ldquo;The increasingly unregulated labour  market is returning to the way it was in the 19th century before trade  unionism... The study suggests the sharp decline in workplace trade unionism  since 1980 (with a fall from 58 per cent to 40 per cent in membership) has not  led to any spontaneous move by employers to introduce alternative forms of  worker representation or joint consultation.&rdquo; Instead, the report states, they &ldquo;appear  to be moving towards the situation in which non-managerial employees are  treated as a &lsquo;factor of production&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Since when have workers been treated as anything else? However, there is no  doubt that the bosses, in Britain and elsewhere, are taking advantage of mass  unemployment, and reactionary anti-union laws and other forms of &ldquo;deregulation&rdquo;  to try to carry through a real counter-revolution on the factory floor. Even  the conservative Financial Times is compelled to recognise that &ldquo;Management is  growing increasingly autocratic in its wielding of autocratic power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  The report adds that:</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;The recent growth in inequality in wages and earnings which has been  widely observed to be greater in Britain than in almost any other developed  economies is being matched by a widening in the inequalities of influence and  access to key decisions about work and employment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  According to figures published recently by Mr. Nick Adking, a statistician  at the Department of Social Security, the real income of the poorest 20% in  Britain fell by about 3%, after housing costs, between 1979 and 1990-91. On the  other hand, the richest 20% saw their incomes go up by 49%, in the same period.  In 1990-91, the poorest 20% depended on state benefits for 69% of their income.</p>
<p>
  The abolition of wages councils in 1993 has resulted in a substantial drop  in pay rates, according to the Low Pay Network, which found that 18.1% of jobs  were paying below the minimum rate previously established. In some sectors, the  position was much worse: &ldquo;The survey, covering 1,500 vacancies at 45 Jobcentres  found that 27.1% of jobs in the retail sector were paid below the last wages  council rate, followed by hairdressing with 20.8%, the clothing industry with  13.8% and hotel and catering with 12.2%.</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;It found underpayment ranging from an average of 9.2% in the clothing  sector to an average of 22.6% in hairdressing, where the last set rate was 2.88  an hour.</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;Before abolishing the wages councils, the government argued that removing  the statutory minimum wage would have little impact on wage levels or  employment.&rdquo; (Financial Times, 14/2/94).</p>
<p>
  According to the official figures, the average Briton saw his or her real  income rise by 25.4% since 1979. But this disguises a huge increase in living  standards for the better-off, and, at the other extreme, a rapid process of  impoverishment.</p>
<p>
  It is true that many workers, in the last period, have been able to  purchase things like videos, dishwashers, hi-fi equipment and the like which  would have been unthinkable for an earlier generation. This creates a sensation  of well-being and &ldquo;prosperity.&rdquo; However, on the one hand, this partly reflects  the general cheapening of commodities, manifested in rapidly falling prices of  what were previously considered luxury items (computers are a good example). On  the other hand, the consumer boom of the 1980s was achieved at the cost of a  colossal increase in indebtedness through credit which, as we have seen, is one  of the reasons why the present recession has been prolonged.</p>
<p>
  Take Japan, for instance. In 1986, Japanese households had debts worth 92%  of their annual post-tax incomes. The figure for the USA was about the same. By  the end of the decade, Japan&rsquo;s ratio had jumped to 116%. But the trouble with  credit, as every worker knows, is that eventually it has to be paid back&#8212;and  with interest. It is a way of taking capitalism beyond its normal limits. But  at the end of the day, the price must be paid in the form of a deepening of the  crisis. According to some estimates, the burden of debt repayment in Japan has  cut consumer demand by around 2% since 1990. Britain and America experienced a  similar phenomenon earlier on.</p>
<p>
  In other words, the absolute increase in living standards during the boom  was achieved in the advanced capitalist countries, on the one hand by workers  toiling extra, stretching themselves to the limit, working overtime, week-ends  and so on. On the other hand, it was achieved by the cheap labour and  exploitation of women and young people. Finally, it was the result of the &ldquo;artificial  paradise&rdquo; of credit, which ended up in a nightmare of debt.</p>
<p>
  All this, of course, refers to the workers in average or &ldquo;well-paid&rdquo; jobs.  But at the bottom end of the scale, we see the relentless spread of poverty,  and even the creation, at the lowest level, of a kind of &ldquo;under-class&rdquo; of  people who are, in effect, excluded from the right to a civilised existence.</p>
<p>
  In London and Paris we have the scourge of homelessness and a large number  of young people with no job, living on the streets in conditions reminiscent of  Victorian times&#8212;easy prey to crime, drug addiction and prostitution.</p>
<p>
  The Economist (11/4/92) carried an article describing the conditions of the  urban poor in the United States:</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;These crumbling vertical ghettos, housing 20,000 people, all of them  black: another 5-7,000 live as illicit stowaways. It is down there, in that  wasteland of smashed windows and stale urine, that America&rsquo;s most pathological  ills are concentrated. The statistics speak plainly of how 50 years of public  housing has failed to help those it was meant to help: ... Nine-tenths of  households have a single parent, so parental authority is spread thin. Nearly  everyone depends upon government assistance of some sort. This housing was  meant to provide shelter of last resort. Yet many families have lived in it for  three generations.&rdquo; These lines refer to the Robin Taylor Homes in Chicago, but  they could refer to any one of a thousand such &ldquo;inner city areas,&rdquo; and not only  in the United States. The article goes on:</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;The Housing Act of 1949 promised &lsquo;a decent home and a suitable looking  environment for every American family.&rsquo; During the economic boom of the 1980s,  the country&rsquo;s poorest fifth got poorer and housing assistance rose. The number  of poverty level households assisted grew by 161% between 1974 and 1989 to 2.4  million according to the joint centre for housing studies at Harvard  University. But the growth in poverty outstripped the growth in Federal  Resources. Over 5 million renters and 4 million home owners live, unassisted,  below the poverty level.</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;In the past, housing used to be like the car market: through deterioration  units become cheaper, and so affordable for the poor. No longer. The number of  housing units that were rented for less than $250 a month (in 1989 dollars)  fell from 8.6 million in 1974 to just 6 million in 1989. A lot of &lsquo;low cost&rsquo;  housing became gentrified during the 1980s. In poor neighbourhoods, even more  housing promised landlords so little prospect of return that buildings have  been abandoned, reinforcing urban decay.</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;The cost of housing now lies at the heart of America&rsquo;s poverty. More than  three quarters of renters bellow the poverty level and more than half of poor  home owners spend more than half their income on housing costs. It would take  $20 billion to clear up America&rsquo;s housing and make it ready to sell.</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;But consider this. Some 56% of Federal housing subsidies or 49.9 billion  dollars goes (mostly in the form of mortgage interest relief) to the richest  fifth of Americans each year. Just $14.9 billion goes to the poorest fifth. The  disparity is absurd, visibly so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  The same journal (21/3/92) dealt with the spread of diseases, like  tuberculosis in the poor urban areas of the most developed capitalist country:</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;The United States thought it had eradicated TB. Yet the disease has  already reached epidemic proportions in New York city: Doctors estimate that  there were almost 5,000 new cases last year, 35% more than in 1990 (the most  recent year for which an official tally is available), and about 300 deaths.  More than one in six of America&rsquo;s TB sufferers is in New York city.</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;Measles and syphilis struck last year too, and the struggle against AIDS  goes on all the time. Now the resurgence of TB threatens to overwhelm the city&rsquo;s  health officials. The long decline in TB stopped in New York at the end of the  1970s, but it is only in the last couple of years that the disease has one more  spread rapidly. The HIV virus, homelessness, poverty, and drug abuse all make  people more vulnerable. The disease has been incubated in the city&rsquo;s  overcrowded prisons, hospital wards and shelters. Two out of three sufferers  are young blacks or Hispanics. New Yorkers have a worse record than the people  of most Third World countries when it comes to completing treatment. In  Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique, according to the World Bank, the completion  rate (for TB) is 80%; in East Harlem, with one of the highest rates of  infection, it is 11%.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Marx and Engels pointed out over a century ago that the bourgeoisie was  compelled to take action to introduce better sanitation into the workers&rsquo;  districts when the epidemics of disease begun to spread to the &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; middle  class areas. The article goes on to point to the risk of court actions against  the New York City council, and comments: &ldquo;New York cannot afford them. Even  less, however, can it afford to let TB spread&#8212;as it will&#8212;to plush offices  and nice homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Behind the righteous indignation of the bourgeois against the so-called &ldquo;law  of increasing immiseration&rdquo; lies an uncomfortable awareness that, in fact,  there has been a tendency to reduce a significant layer of society to absolute  poverty.</p>
<p>
  While the rich have grown richer, the poor have sunk to a level which  literally approaches the type of conditions we associate with the novels of  Charles Dickens&#8212;or the chapters in Marx&rsquo;s Capital on Machinery and the  Working Day&#8212;among the greatest examples of social criticism in the whole of  political literature.</p>
<p>
  A recent study by a children&rsquo;s charity revealed that basic social security  benefit paid to more than 1.5 million families in Britain does not even pay for  the diet prescribed for a child in a Victorian workhouse.</p>
<p>
  The Food Commission costed the diet of a child in a workhouse in the East  End of London in 1876 and arrived at the figure of &pound;5.46 a week  at today&rsquo;s prices. This compared to &pound;4.15 a week allowed in income  support for a child under 11.</p>
<p>
  Tony White, the charity&rsquo;s chief executive commented: &ldquo;It is appalling, as  we approach the year 2,000, that even an 1876 workhouse diet is too expensive  for the families of one in four of our children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Marx wrote about the terrible conditions of the mainly women workers in the  garment trade in the East End of London. The abolition of the wages councils  and the drastic reduction of factory inspection under the Tory government means  that, in all probability, the conditions of the (mainly Asian) women workers in  these trades will be all too similar.</p>
<p>
  And not only in Britain. In California, one of the most prosperous and &ldquo;liberal&rdquo;  states of the most powerful and wealthy nation on earth, we have the same  phenomenon&#8212;the &ldquo;agony of toil, slavery, ignorance, brutality and mental  degradation,&rdquo; of which Marx wrote. Thus, The Economist (12/2/94) reports:</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The garment industry in California has long depended on seamstresses,  usually Chinese immigrants, toiling in back alley sweatshops for illegally low  rates of pay.&rdquo; For a dress retailing at $150, a seamstress will &ldquo;probably pick  up about $6.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;In December (1993), a sweep through 71 shops in San Francisco and Oakland  found more than half of them in violation of minimum-wage standards. Sewing  jobs for Esprit, Liz Claiborne, Izumi and other glittering names were being  done by underpaid workers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  It tends to be forgotten that all the gains made by the working class in  the past were obtained through struggle. The ruling class has never conceded  anything without a fight. It is true that, in a period of economic upswing, the  capitalists can afford to part with a small part of their profits, so long as  they continue to enrich themselves at the expense of the working class. But now  that the period of upswing has ended, they have launched an all-out offensive  to eliminate the conquests of labour.</p>
<p>
  In the United States, even during the &ldquo;Reagan boom,&rdquo; of the 1980s,  unit-labour costs in manufacturing industry actually declined by an average of  6.4% a year (in 1985-93).In Germany and Japan they rose 4.2% and 6.6%  respectively in the same period. But now the German and Japanese capitalists  want to pursue the same policy. Chancellor Kohl lectures the German workers,  complaining that they are &ldquo;over-paid,&rdquo; &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; and work too few hours.</p>
<p>
  The capitalists of all other countries are singing the same song. Fred  Lempers of the Netherlands Chamber of Employers recently stated that Dutch  companies were hoping that the minimum wage (2,163 guilders, or $1,141 a month)  would &ldquo;at least be halved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  In Belgium, the imposition of a series of austerity plans provoked a  general strike in November 1993. The attempt of the Spanish government to  impose deregulation of the labour market also provoked a 24-hour general  strike.</p>
<p>
  Everywhere you look, the capitalists and their governments are attempting  to find a way out of the crisis at the expense of the working class. The  illusions in a future based upon full employment and prosperity which became  widespread in the advanced capitalist world on the basis of nearly four decades  of economic upswing, are swiftly disappearing:</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;The American tradition is based on the expectation of rising wealth. Large  parts of the population are now faced with the reality of being poorer than  their parents, or even their grandparents. The price of industrial  competitiveness may thus be the lowering of expectations, not only for wages  but for working hours and conditions. In the US, the lesson is proving painful.  Europe, for the most part, has yet to confront it.&rdquo; (Financial Times, 7/2/94).</p>
<h4>The &ldquo;Third World&rdquo;</h4>
<p>
  The period since the Second World War has been one of uninterrupted turmoil  in the underdeveloped capitalist countries. The people of Africa, Asia and  Latin America, amounting to two thirds of the human race, derived little benefit  from the fireworks display of economic growth in the industrialised West. They  remained hungry spectators at the feast of world capitalism.</p>
<p>
  Even the relative development of industry made possible by the world  economic upswing of 1948-73 did not prevent a fall in national income for most  of these countries, leading to a general economic and social crisis.</p>
<p>
  Nominally independent, they are even more enslaved than before. The  economies of these countries are tied by a million chains to the chariot of  world imperialism, which exercises its domination through international trade  and the mechanisms of the world market based on the exchange of more labour for  less.</p>
<p>
  According to figures published by the UN Development Programme for 1992,  the gap between rich and poor countries has increased inexorably over the past  decades. Since 1960 the share of the world&rsquo;s gross product of the richest 20%  grew from 70.2% to 82.7%. This means that the industrialised capitalist  countries are now 60 times wealthier than those countries where the poorest 20%  live. The gap between the two has doubled in the last thirty years.</p>
<p>
  However, even these figures understate the reality. In the advanced  countries of capitalism, millions live in poverty, while the Third World has  its share of wealthy parasites and exploiters. The same report reveals that the  difference of income between the world&rsquo;s richest billion and the world&rsquo;s  poorest billion is more than 150 to one.</p>
<p>
  In the last decade of the 20th Century, despite all the wonders of modern  science, two thirds of humanity live on the border line of barbarism. Common  diseases, such as diarrhoea and measles kill seven million children a year. Yet  this can be prevented by a cheap and simple vaccination. 500,000 women die each  year from complications during pregnancy, and perhaps another 200,000 die from  abortions. The ex-colonial countries spent only 4% of their GDP on health&#8212;an  average of $41 a head, compare with $1900 in the advanced capitalist countries.</p>
<p>
  According to United Nations reports, more than 6 billion people will  inhabit the earth by the year 2,000. About half of them will be under the age  of 20. Yet most suffer from unemployment, lack of basic education and health  care, overcrowding and bad living conditions. An estimated 100 million children  aged 6 to 11 are not in school. Two thirds are girls. Incidentally, even in the  USA UNICEF estimates that 20% of children live below the national poverty line.  However, the situation in third world countries has reached a horrific level.</p>
<p>
  As many as a 100 million children live on the streets. In Brazil, this  problem has been &ldquo;solved&rdquo; by a campaign by the police and murder squads to  exterminate children for the crime of being poor. Similar atrocities are being  carried out against homeless people in Colombia. </p>
<p>
  One million children have been killed, 4 million seriously injured, and 5  million have become refugees or orphaned as a result of wars in the past  decade. In many ex-colonial countries, we have the phenomenon of child labour,  often amounting to slavery. The hypocritical protests in the Western media do  not prevent the products of this labour from reaching Western markets and  increasing the capital of &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; western companies. A typical example  was the recently published case of a match factory where children, mostly  girls, work a 6 day-60 hour-week, with toxic chemicals, for three dollars. A  letter to the Economist of the 15th September 1993 pointed out that: &ldquo;Parents  do realise the value of education for the future of their children but often  their poverty is so desperate that they cannot do without the wages of their  labouring children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  The main reason for the grinding poverty of the third world is the two-fold  looting of the resources through the terms of trade, and the trillion dollars  debt owed by the third world to the big western banks. Just to pay the interest  on the debt, these countries have to export food needed by their own people and  sacrifice the health and education of the people. According to UNICEF, debt  repayments have caused incomes in the third world to fall by a quarter, health  expenditure by 50% and educational expenditure by 25%. Despite the hypocritical  outcry against the destruction of the Amazonian rainforest, Brazilian  economists have proved that this is mainly motivated by the need to raised cash  for agricultural exports, such as beef, raised on reclaimed land. The financing  for such export projects comes from the World Bank and other international  financial organisations.</p>
<p>
  The plight of the third world was vividly expressed in the 1989 UNICEF  report:</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;Three years ago, former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere asked the  question, &ldquo;must we starve our children to pay our debt?&rdquo; That question has been  answered in practice. And the answer has been &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. In those three years  hundreds of thousands of the world&rsquo;s children have given their lives to pay  their countries&rsquo; debts, and many millions more are still paying the interest  with their malnourished minds and bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Impasse of Capitalism</h4>
<p>
  Before the war, Trotsky referred to the capitalist class &ldquo;tobogganing  towards disaster with its eyes closed.&rdquo; The same could be said of capitalism  today, after an interval of more than half a century.</p>
<p>
  Since World War Two, bourgeois governments have tried everything from  Keynesianism to Monetarism, and every conceivable combination in between. The  Keynesian experiment was responsible for an explosion of inflation at the end  of the 1970s and forced them to beat a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>
  Since then, we have seen the monetarist reaction, which was allegedly going  to restore sound finance and balanced budgets. What was the result? In Britain,  the application of monetarist policies under Thatcher led to a collapse of  industry, from which it has still not recovered. From 28.4% of GDP in 1971,  manufacturing industry fell to 23.1% in 1989. Those employed in manufacturing  fell from 8.4 million in 1969 to 5.1 million in 1990. On the other hand, the  parasitic banking sector increased from 9.3% in 1971 to 18.7% in 1989.</p>
<p>
  At the same time, in all the advanced capitalist countries, there has been  an inexorable rise in budget deficits, and this in spite of sharp cut-backs in  state expenditure. Last year, the average budget deficit of the OECD countries  stood at 4.2% of GDP&#8212;a huge increase from 1% of GDP in 1989. Worse still,  their total public sector debt rocketed to about 63% of GDP (up from 42% in  1980). The interest on this debt alone represents a colossal drain on the  resources of society.</p>
<p>
  In the European Union, the average budget deficit increased from 3% of GDP  in 1989 to about 7% in 1993&#8212;the highest level since the Second World War, and  even bigger, proportionately, than America&rsquo;s (4.4%).</p>
<p>
  Moreover, the OECD reckons that as much as three-quarters of America&rsquo;s  budget deficit, and two-thirds of Europe&rsquo;s is &ldquo;structural,&rdquo; and will persist  even when the economy picks up again.</p>
<p>
  Given this situation, a return to Keynesian methods of deficit financing  would provoke an explosion of inflation. On the other hand, attempts to cut the  deficit will decrease demand, thereby aggravating the crisis.</p>

  The fact that these staggering deficits were piled up during the boom of  1982-90 is a further indication of the sickness of the system. In the past,  deficits were used by the Keynesians to get out of slumps by &ldquo;creating demand.&rdquo;  Now Western governments cannot do this because the deficit was allowed to get  out of hand in the previous period.</p>
<p>
  Far from increasing public spending, they are continually cutting back,  despite the fact that in countries such as Britain, the infrastructure (health,  schools, roads, railways, housing) is falling to pieces. Even the meagre &ldquo;benefits&rdquo;  of the unemployed, invalids, single parents and old age pensions are singled  out for attack. And still the budget deficit continues to grow, as a result of  the fall in production and huge interest repayments.</p>
<p>
  The bourgeois economists contradict themselves continually. On the one hand  they argue that there is &ldquo;not sufficient demand&rdquo; in the economy, while simultaneously  arguing in favour of a cut in demand in the form of wage cuts and slashing  public expenditure. Wherever they turn, they are trapped between the twin evils  of inflation and deflation. In other words, whatever they do will be wrong.</p>
<p>
  In the long term, the outlook for capitalism is hopeless. However, that  does not mean that it will automatically disappear. Capitalism always moves  through booms and slumps. It is like breathing in and out. It accompanies  capitalism from the cradle to the grave. However, the vigorous respiration of a  healthy child is not the same as the painful wheezing of senile decrepitude.  The capitalist system is sick, and the sickness is terminal.</p>
<p>
  Karl Marx explained over a hundred years ago that the final barrier to  capitalist production is capitalism itself. It is true there is no &ldquo;final  crisis&rdquo; of capitalism. It is true that, until it is overthrown by the working  class, it will always find a way out. But, in finding a way out, the bourgeois  always increase the contradictions of the system and ultimately make matters  worse.</p>
<p>
  For reasons which we have outlined above, the capitalist system, after four  decades of expansion, is now reaching its limits. The long period of relative  peace and prosperity in the advanced capitalist countries is drawing to a  close. Halfway through the last decade of the twentieth century&#8212;a century  already characterised by two world wars and untold calamities for the human  race&#8212;the world is faced with a new period of wars, civil wars, revolution and  counter-revolution. In the course of this period, the destiny of humanity will  be settled, one way or another.</p>
<p>
  What &ldquo;way out&rdquo; can there be for capitalism? As Lenin used to say, the truth  is always concrete. The bourgeois have tried Keynesianism and Monetarism. Both  ultimately failed&#8212;the second far more quickly than the first. They can try a  mix of both these witches brews. That will bring them the worst of all worlds&#8212;a mixture of inflation and deflation, which will rapidly provoke new social and  political convulsions.</p>
<p>
  Over many decades, all the contradictions have been piling up. Now they  must pick up the bill. In 1914 and 1939, they took to the path of war to  attempt to resolve their problems. But the existence of terrifying weapons of  destruction&#8212;nuclear, chemical, biological&#8212;means that an all-out war between  the major powers would necessarily end in mutual annihilation. Since the  capitalists do not wage war for the fun of it, but in order to conquer markets,  raw materials, territory and spheres of influence, this road is effectively  blocked, at least as long as the working class and its organisations remain  intact.</p>
<p>
  This means that the contradictions of capitalism must express themselves in  an ever sharper conflict between the classes. The bourgeois of every country  are agreed on one thing: it is necessary to drive down living standards, to  slash state expenditure, to destroy the welfare state because &ldquo;we&rdquo; (that is to  say, the capitalist system) cannot afford it. That means that they threaten to  eliminate all those things which make life bearable for the majority of people,  all those elements which make for at least a semi-civilised existence.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The revolution needs the whip of counter-revolution,&rdquo; Marx used to say.  The counter-offensive of capital will have a profound effect on the working  class, which has accumulated colossal power over the past few decades. The  general strikes in Spain, Belgium and Italy are a warning that the workers will  not stand idly by to watch their living standards destroyed.</p>
<p>
  The next period will see big battles between the classes that will put the  struggles of the past in the shade. Once again, the workers will begin to move  through the mass organisations of the class, beginning with the trade unions,  to attempt to transform society. Sooner or later, they will take power in one  country or another, as they did in Russia in 1917. When that happens, it will  transform the world far more quickly than in 1917-21. The basis will be laid  for the victory of socialism on a world scale.</p>
<h4>For a Workers&rsquo; Democracy!</h4>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;Owing to the extensive use of machinery and to the division of labour,&rdquo;  wrote Marx and Engels in the Communist Manifesto, &ldquo;the work of the proletarian  has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the  workman. He becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most  simple, most monotonous, and most easily required knack, that is required of  him.&rdquo; (Marx-Engels, Selected Works, Vol.1, p.114).</p>
<p>
  In the days of Ancient Rome, a slave was described as &ldquo;instrumentum vocalis&rdquo;&#8212;a &ldquo;tool with a voice.&rdquo; Nowadays, the position of most &lsquo;free&rsquo; workers is not  much better. Not only the deadly monotony and exhausting work of the production  line, but also the soul-destroying nature of the work of many white-collar  workers working with computers in large offices which, in effect, increasingly  resemble factories. And this is the way most people spend their lives, if they  are lucky enough to find work at all!</p>
<p>
  Yet the development of technique means that it is possible to abolish, or reduce  to a minimum expression, this kind of inhuman toil. The word &ldquo;robot&rdquo; comes from  the Czech &ldquo;robotnik,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;a slave.&rdquo; That is just what industrial  robots are. They do not sleep, they do not stop for a tea-break or lunch, they  work ceaselessly 14 hours a day, performing their tasks with great flexibility  and to the highest standard. In fact, just as the boss would like the worker to  be!</p>
<p>
  It is quite possible nowadays to have big factories with no workers at all,  other than those required for maintenance. The general introduction of  industrial robots to large-scale industry therefore potentially represents the  greatest labour-saving revolution in history.</p>
<p>
  Under capitalism, such a development would lead to unemployment on an  unimaginable scale, and ultimately provoke the collapse of the whole system.  Hence, although the technology exists and also, as we have seen, huge amounts  of capital which is not being put to productive use, the introduction of the  new technology has been extremely slow and uneven.</p>
<p>
  The same economic system which dooms 50 million people in the  industrialised countries, and further hundreds of millions in Africa, Asia and  Latin America to a life of enforced idleness and misery, and which  systematically destroys the means of production, closing down factories like so  many matchboxes, also prevents the utilisation of technology which could  transform the lives of the peoples of the world.</p>
<p>
  One of the most striking features of modern capitalism is the way in which  it has united the whole world under its control. The prediction of the authors  of the Communist Manifesto has been borne out in an almost laboratory pure  fashion. The international division of labour has been carried to an extreme.  The world market exercises an irresistible pull on all national economies. No  power, not the USA, not Russia nor China can tear itself free from it.</p>
<p>
  Under capitalism the &ldquo;New World Order&rdquo; manifests itself as the ruthless  domination of a handful of imperialist powers, headed by the United States, and  a few hundred giant multinationals, which treat the semi-colonial countries of  Africa, Asia and Latin America as their feudal fiefdoms. For the masses of the Third World, capitalism is, in the phrase of Lenin, &ldquo;horror without end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Yet the case for a genuine New World Order is really unanswerable. It is  not only the means of putting an end to the crazy economic imbalances and the  crying social injustices which are an endless source of human misery, wars and  conflicts. It is a matter of absolute necessity for the very survival of the  planet.</p>
<p>
  The blind search after short-term gain for the monopolies leads to the rape  of the world&rsquo;s resources and the destruction of the environment. Not just the  felling of rain-forests, but the systematic poisoning of the food we eat, the  water we drink, the air we breathe. In the first volume of Capital, Marx  already pointed to this destructive tendency of the profit system. But now it  has reached a critical point. If this rampage is allowed to continue unchecked,  the future not just of the human race, but possibly of life on earth could be  placed in terrible danger.</p>
<p>
  The reality is that the productive forces have long outstripped the limits  of private ownership and the nation state. In order to realise the astonishing  potential of modern industry, science and technique, it is necessary to achieve  a system based upon the harmonious planning of production on a global scale.  The prior condition for this is the overthrow of the dictatorship of the big  banks and monopolies, and its replacement by a genuine regime of workers&rsquo;  democracy.</p>
<p>
  The development of production and new techniques enters in contradiction  with the old idea of the worker as a mere appendage of the machine. In order to  make the best use of sophisticated techniques, and achieve a high level of  quality, it is necessary to achieve the conscious participation of the workers  at all levels. In effect, this fact is recognised, although in a distorted way  by the latest Japanese production concepts. Even the most sophisticated robots  can never attain the same level of creative consciousness as a human being,  although it may be far more efficient at performing mechanical tasks. The  necessity for democratic workers&rsquo; control and management, far from being a  Marxist utopia, flows inevitably from the demands of modern production itself.</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;Instead of mindlessly carrying out a single, repetitive operation,  tomorrow&rsquo;s car worker is more likely to be a team member with many skills and  greater responsibilities...</p>
<p class="quote">
  &ldquo;For some car firms, survival will depend on how successful they are at  promoting teamwork throughout their organisations. People are so much  dexterous, flexible and inventive than robots&#8212;which is why the Japanese  believe that automation should help people to work in factories rather than  replace them. Robots alone could not achieve the Holy Grail of flexible  production.&rdquo; (The Economist, 17/10/92). </p>
<p>
  Of course, in practice, the intention of the Japanese monopolies is to  invent a new way of squeezing more surplus value out of the workers. Despite  the fine words printed above, about robots helping people to work in factories,  the big Japanese car-makers did not hesitate to lay-off workers once their  profits were affected.</p>
<p>
  In a genuine socialist planned economy, the general introduction of the new  techniques would be used to reduce the working day to a minimum expression.  This would provide the material basis for a qualitative advance of human  civilisation.</p>
<p>
  The Greek philosopher Aristotle said that &ldquo;Man begins to philosophise when  the necessities of life are provided.&rdquo; By philosophise we mean the ability to  think in general, to lift one&rsquo;s eyes, above the worries and immediate pressures  of every day existence, to seek a broader horizon, to contemplate life, nature,  and the Universe. In present-day society, the minds of men and women are  oppressed by the struggle for survival&#8212;whether or not they will find work,  whether they will be able to pay the bills at the end of the month, find a roof  over their heads, obtain provision for sickness and old age. Only when these  degrading obsessions are eliminated will men and women become genuinely free  human beings, able for the first time to realise their full potential.</p>
<p>
  Trotsky once asked the question: &ldquo;How many Aristotles are herding swine?  How many swineherds are sitting on thrones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Throughout history, the mass of humanity have been deprived of access to  free time, education and culture which would permit them to contribute to  society&rsquo;s store of knowledge. It is a crime of class society that such a vast  reservoir of human talent is wasted. By releasing it, socialism would prepare  the way for such a blossoming of culture, art and science as has never been  seen in human history. Humanity would draw itself up to its full height. This  would mark the end of human prehistory and the commencement of the true history  of the human race.</p>
