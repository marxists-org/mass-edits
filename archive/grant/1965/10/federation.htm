Pakistan was deliberatelycreated by British Imperialism at the time that the capitalists were compelledto concede independence. As always, British Imperialism hoped to gain by thepolicy of &ldquo;divide and rule&rdquo; which she has used profitably forcenturies. However the steady decline in the strength of British capitalism hasundermined the hold which she had on the entire subcontinent of India.</p><p>Pakistan split into twohalves, separated by the width of India, has continued to be a ramshackle statewhere the Pakistani landlords and capitalists have been able to maintain theirdominance by working on the religious prejudices and fears of the peasants andtribesmen. Pakistan is a Muslim theocratic state, with a large Hindu minorityin East Pakistan, the Bengal wing of the State. Created amid communal riots andmassacres of millions of Hindus and Muslims, at the time of the partition ofIndia, there has been a mass fleeing of Muslims to Pakistan and of Hindus to India,during the last twenty years, following on communal riots in either country,which have then precipitated similar riots in the other.</p><p>Indiatoo, because of the domination of the Indian landlords and capitalists has beenunable to find a solution to the problems which she inherited from the BritishRaj. Food production in proportion to population has actually declined. Themass of the population remains illiterate.</p><p>India,in population, industry and resources remains the stronger of the two nations.Thus, with aid from Britain and America for the time being she has been enabledto retain a shaky form of democracy.</p><p>InPakistan a military-police Bonapartist, or dictatorial state, has replaced thefeeble democracy with which the State began its existence.</p><p>Betweenthe two countries, has been the aggravated dispute over Kashmir. A&ldquo;present&rdquo; bequeathed by the former rulers. Kashmir has anoverwhelming Muslim majority in its population, of millions. With importantresources and a strategic position, despite the small population, Kashmirbecame a key question.</p><h4>Independence</h4><p class="fst">At the time of partition, Kashmir was one of the artificial princely statesmaintained by the British. Its Hindu ruler was opposed by the Kashmir Congress,which supported on a non-communal basis the Indian Congress, with the MuslimSheikh Abdullah, as its ruler. An attempt by the Pakistanis to take over, endedin panic, the ruler acceded to India. The fighting between Indian and Pakistanitroops at that time ended in the establishment of a &ldquo;cease-fire&rdquo;line, which remained the boundary between Indian and Pakistan held Kashmir, upto the outbreak of the present fighting.</p><p>Thepopulation of Kashmir gradually became disillusioned with the Indian rulers.Sheikh Abdullah who came into opposition, under the pressure of the population,was deposed and imprisoned. A virtual military regime was established. As withthe rest of the subcontinent there was the accumulation of dissatisfaction andopposition. A tendency towards independence from both India and Pakistan beganto manifest itself, especially with the release, then reinternment, of SheikhAbdullah.</p><h4>Internal pressures</h4><p class="fst">Theinternal pressures in both countries led the Bonapartist ruler of Pakistan,Ayub Khan to launch on an adventure. Thousands of armed infiltrators fromPakistan were sent into Kashmir. Ayub Khan hoped that this would provoke anuprising. When this failed, the forces sent into Indian-held Kashmir switched toguerilla tactics. This was intended gradually to sap the strength of the Indians,until it would not be worth their while to hold Kashmir.</p><p>Forthe Pakistan landlords and capitalists this was a bad miscalculation. TheIndian ruling class, could not retreat on this issue without provoking fatalconsequences to their state and themselves. Their army had already suffered acrushing and ignominious defeat at the hands of the Chinese in 1962.Consequently they had to make a stand. Already there had been the clash betweenthe two states over the boundary of the Rann of Kutch which was settled by an indeterminatetruce.</p><p>Thewar on both sides had reactionary aims. Waged by the feeble ruling class ofboth countries, who were dependent for their supplies of planes and tanks onthe Imperialist Powers of Britain and America. It is against the interest ofthe peoples of both countries. They are of common stock speaking in many casesthe same languages: Punjabi, Bengali and so on.</p><p>Theimmediate result has been a victory of the Indian ruling class, who havepenetrated part of the territory, formerly occupied by the Pakistanis, seizedat the time of the last truce. They have also occupied parts of Pakistan, nearthe city of Lahore and other sectors.</p><h4>Financial power</h4><p class="fst">Inthe dirty game of power politics both the Russian and the Chinese bureaucracyvied with each other. At the &ldquo;United&rdquo; Nations, paralysed now for awhole period by the struggle between the Russian bloc and that of the westernImperialist camp, the Russians and the Americans joined together and demanded anend of the fighting. This was completely different to the situation over theCongo and other areas, not to speak of the Korean War.</p><p>Thehumour of the Western press lecturing the Indians and Pakistanis as to thefutility and senselessness of war, is best illustrated when one turns the pagesof the same papers and reads the reports of the brutal war of interventionbeing waged by American Imperialism in Vietnam.</p><p>Thedominant power of the industrial giants is illustrated by the threat to cut offall supplies from the warring nations. This was decisive. Pakistan and Indiahad to bow to the superior industrial and financial power of these countries.Even had the war continued they would have been denuded of tanks, planes andthe key weapons of war within a period of a few months. Even more important,their economies would grind to a stand-still without the economic&ldquo;aid&ldquo;.</p><h4>Class policy lacking</h4><p class="fst">TheBritish Imperialists have enormous vested interests at stake especially inIndia. This was the cause of their anxiety. Due to Asian and world developmentsthe position of India and Pakistan was different to their calculations of 1947.Consequently they stood to lose either way, especially with the continuance ofthe war.</p><p>TheRussian bureaucracy abandoning all pretence of a class policy, offered to&ldquo;mediate&rdquo; between India and Pakistan, i.e. between their rulers. Whata comment on the degeneration of the usurpers of the tradition of the OctoberRevolution. To make an analogy, one could hardly visualise I.C.I. and Courtauldsin any dispute they might have getting or accepting the &ldquo;mediation&rdquo;of the trade unions! It is just the same for the workers' state in relation tocapitalist states. The Chinese bureaucracy, also playing the game of powerpolitics, lined up with the odious theocratic-dictatorial state against India;on various pretexts threatening war, in order to hold Indian troops on thefrontier between them. Thus the &ldquo;ultimatums&rdquo; threatening actionwithin a few days, were designed to aid the Pakistanis, who were getting theworst of the military battles.</p><h4>Fear revolution</h4><p class="fst">Inthis vile pantomime, we had Russia and China, the two bureaucratic workers'States lining up and manoeuvring against each other. The consequences of theChinese game have ended to the disadvantage of China, with the Indians moredependent on Imperialism and both the Indians and Pakistanis looking to thegood offices of the Russian bureaucracy.</p><p>ForAmerica and Russia, this was a secondary question, above all where theirinterests did not conflict. Consequently their mutually agreed approach. Butfar from demonstrating the efficacy of the United Nations, it merelydemonstrates the super-power of the two giant powers. Both were afraid ofrevolutionary consequences if the war should continue, with the uprising ofboth the workers and peasants of Pakistan and of India. Consequently theiragreement. They want to preserve the status quo.</p><p>TheChinese were interested only in their own narrow nationalist aims. They werenot in the least concerned with the effects of their policies on the Indianworking class. By alienating the Indian workers and peasants they onlystrengthened the ruling class.</p><h4>Real peace</h4><p class="fst">Howeverthe stirring up of the workers and peasants, even in the short period of thewar can only further accelerate the growth of contradictions in both India andPakistan. Even the capitalist press speaks of the possibility of the fall ofAyub Khan, consequent on the defeat which the Pakistani dictatorship hassuffered. There will be disillusionment also in India. The stirring of theIndian masses will have its effect also on the Indian State. A profound changeon the Indian subcontinent has begun.</p><p>The Indian Marxists and those of Pakistan will have attacked the viciouscalculations of the money-lenders of Karachi and Delhi. They will call for anindependent Socialist Kashmir, without landlords and capitalists, with
equal rights for all in a secular state.
<!-- In the original print version, two lines were interchanged here. -->
They will call for the overthrow of both the Indian and Pakistani ruling class, exposing the real war aim of both. They will call for a Socialist Federation of the peoples of the entiresubcontinent, with autonomy for all those sections of the people who desireit. Only thus can there be real peace in this part of Asia.</p><p>Withmany storms and struggles, which will now be internally directed, the peoplesof this area will come to understand that only a Socialist Federation, restingon the support of the world working class can lead to peace and prosperity.</p><p class="skip">&#160;</p><hr class="end"><p class="footer"><a href="../../index.htm">Ted Grant Archive</a></p></body></html>
