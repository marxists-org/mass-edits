&ldquo;Like every radical government before it&mdash;and it is true not only of the
Labour governments since the Second World War but also true of the
Liberal governments before the First World War&mdash;it has to face this
tremendous; conspiracy of those who have and who lived by having,
rather than earning. Throughout history no privileged group has ever
surrendered without a fight and usually that has meant without any
holds barred&hellip;&rdquo; (George Brown)
</p>
<p class="fst">
Harold Wilson, George Brown, Jim Callaghan and other leaders of the labour
movement made searing criticisms of the policies of the Tories, in
the House of Commons, in general propaganda meetings, especially
during the last general election campaign.
</p>
<p>
All these criticisms can be summed up in the quotations given below from
the speeches of Harold Wilson in Parliament. On July 18<sup>th</sup>
1961 Wilson said
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Surely the government has learned by now that when one restricts production,
whether by hire-purchase restrictions, interest rate policy, or any
of the other techniques they have used, the result is not a fall in
prices but a rise in unit costs, and that means higher prices. Surely
they have learned that lesson by now. Yet here we have a sharp rise
in the cost of living. Prices, costs, fear of the wage spiral, all at
a time when, by common consent, export markets are becoming more
competitive day by day.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
And again:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;of course he had to satisfy the international banking community by
masochistic and irrelevant cuts in our standard of living, harmful
restriction and needless increases in our costs and price structure,
because he believes that international speculators are impressed only
by actions which in the long-term harm the economy.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
They made a devastating indictment of the &ldquo;restrictionist&rdquo;, &ldquo;blind
alley&rdquo; and &ldquo;vicious circle&rdquo; &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; policies of the
Tories. During the course of the whole period of this Labour
government, Wilson and the Cabinet have staggered from one expedient
to another. They have, in reality, adopted far more &ldquo;restrictionist&rdquo;
and &ldquo;blind alley&rdquo; policies of &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; than even in the
worst phase of the Tories under Selwyn Lloyd.
</p>
<p>
Why has this happened, and what are the consequences going to be for the
Labour government and the labour movement in the future? Every worker
in the trade unions, the co-ops and the constituency parties must ask
himself this question. Who is to guarantee that even worse measures
will not be undertaken by the government in the future? Already there
has been the threat of legislation to restrict the rights of the
trade unions in collective bargaining. One Tory expedient after
another is being adopted.
</p>
<p>
It cannot have the result that Wilson and the other leaders desire any
more than the measures of Selwyn Lloyd solved the same critical
problems. The difference being that the world economic situation is
far more difficult than at the time that the Tories acted in this
way. What then to do? What policies to adopt? This is the fundamental
problem facing the movement.
</p>
<p>
For decades now, airy solutions have been advanced. The labour movement
has the strength and the power to win over the majority of the
people, first to understand the problems, then the need for socialist
solutions. But first the active workers in the movement must be
equipped with an understanding of the causes of the crisis and the
only way it can be solved in the interests of the working class, and
not of the capitalists.
</p>
<p>
The indication of the changed position of British capitalism particularly
under the rule of the Tories, lies in the fact that as late as 1950,
25 percent of the world market was under the control of the British
capitalist class. In 13 years of Tory rule this was reduced to 13
percent of world markets, during this period in other fields too, the
same process took place.
</p>
<p>
One of the main causes of this collapse in the power of British
capitalism has been the decay of British imperialism itself. The
shelter that they had in the Empire has now gone. In the period
before the Second World War, with the pound sterling of Britain [and]
the British empire, (but also semi-satellite empires of Britain at
that time, such as France, Italy, Portugal and Belgium,) the British
capitalists could shelter behind the protection of the market that
they possessed. Now the situation has changed; the colonial peoples
have been struggling for their independence. No longer does Britain
directly dominate the economy of these countries by military means
and from that point of view has to compete on more even terms with
the other capitalist powers. Entrenched behind high tariff walls,
entrenched behind the control of their Empire, the British
capitalists had deliberately prevented the modernisation of the
economy because it would not have paid them.
</p>
<p>
Less is spent on education for example, than in any industrial country in
Europe, in relation to income. Only fascist Spain has a worse record
in this regard. Russia, formerly backward Russia, spends 16 times as
much on education, 4 times as much per head of population as Britain.
Germany has twice as many university students as Britain. In the
sphere of the growth of the national income, Britain has the worst
record, apart from Belgium, of any of the industrially developed
states of Europe or of the world. 2.5 percent a year was the increase
in the economy on the average in comparison with the 3.5 percent of
America and a far higher percentage in Germany, in France, in Italy
and in other countries. Every two years since the end of the war
there has been a crisis in the balance of payments. This crisis is
caused by the diseased nature of the British economy. In the years
before the war, there was a deficit in the balance of payments. In
1938 for example about &pound;900 million was imported and only about &pound;500
million exported. The balance was made up by investments abroad,
shipping, insurance and banking. By these means the economy was kept
in balance. Since the war, this has not been so.
</p>
<p>
The steel industry on which the question of nationalisation has come up
in the recent period boasted that in 1964 they had a record
production of 26 million tons. Yet in 1950 Britain had been the third
industrial power in the world and the third producer of steel. In
1963 she had become the fifth industrial power so far as the
production of steel was concerned. 26 million tons of steel were
produced in Britain as against the 38 million in Germany and the 40
million of Japan. Backward Japan has now outstripped the industrial
might of British capitalism. Japan is the third, Germany the fourth,
and Britain now only the fifth industrial power of the world.
</p>
<p>
Russia produced over 85 million tons of steel in 1964. Yet, in 1929 Russia
produced 4 million tons against Britain&rsquo;s 14 million tons. In this
way the superiority of state ownership and a plan is demonstrated
even in a totalitarian system with all the inefficiency, corruption,
and mismanagement that this means. Russia has completely outstripped
the power of British capitalism, on the basis of a plan and on the
basis of the nationalisation of the means of production. Last year
Russia produced more engineers, technicians and scientists than the
rest of the world put together. All these facts demonstrate that the
argument against nationalisation and socialism, assiduously put
forward in the press, and in the propaganda of the ruling class is
patently false, and has demonstrated its falsity, in the language of
figures; in the language of steel, cement, and the other means of
production.
</p>
<p>
25 years ago, Britain, apart from America, New Zealand and Australia,
had the highest standard of living in the world. At that time the
standard of living in Germany was 50 percent or 60 percent of the
standards of the British people. In Sweden the standard of living is
now 30 percent higher than in Britain. In France the working class
has won equal pay for women; in this respect Britain and the British
workers are still lagging behind the achievements of the French
workers and of the workers in Europe.
</p>
<p>
Now we face the position where the standards in Germany and in France are
as high or even higher. In the social services and in pensions too,
Britain is falling behind. As far as unemployment pay is concerned,
for example, it is about 20 percent of the average wage in Britain,
whereas it is about 80 percent of the average wage in Holland.
</p>
<p>
It is true, nevertheless that the absolute standards of the British
working class have increased in the last 25 years. This is due to
overtime working, women working, bonus schemes, and of course to full
employment. In the past, the British capitalists never tired of
speaking of the lazy British workman. Now we have the situation where
the hours worked are higher in Britain than any of the other
industrial countries in Western Europe.
</p>
<p>
When one considers the productivity of labour the working class in Britain
is relatively more exploited than they were before the war. Even if
the absolute standards of the working people have increased, we have
the shame of the exploitation and super-exploitation of women and
youth. Whereas the average wage for men is about &pound;18 0s 0d including
overtime, that for women is only about &pound;9 15s 1d per week.
</p>
<h4>The rich get richer</h4>
<p class="fst">
Under the control of the Tories, rents, interest and profit have increased
enormously. In the last 18 months of Tory rule &pound;3,000 million was
made on the stock exchange in capital gains. With a cut in surtax,
nearly &pound;1,000 million per year has been given in concessions to the
rich under the Tories. Undoubtedly, in spite of the relative decline
of British capitalism the rich are richer than at any time in
history. The slogan of the ruling class seems to be: eat, drink and
be merry and to hell with what happens tomorrow. The reason why
Britain has been falling behind is not at all the demands of the
working class; not at all the refusal of the working class to work;
the real reason has been the failure of the ruling class to re-invest
the money which is squeezed from the unpaid labour of the working
class. Industrial investment in Germany has been 25 percent of the
product per year, in Japan 30 percent, in Britain only 15 percent
including the investment of the state industries.
</p>
<p>
Here, let us point out, that the Tories are not at all against state
expenditure, not at all against the intervention of the state. They
want the intervention of the state for the benefit of the ruling
class, for the benefit of the capitalists and not at all for the
benefit of the people as a whole. Under the Tories and,
unfortunately, it still continues under the Labour government, nearly
&pound;400 million per year is still given in subsidies to the
capitalists. Steel, cotton, the big farmers, whole sections of these,
have continued to receive subsidies from the state. Even today
two-thirds of industrial research, takes place in government,
controlled establishments, or is financed by the government.
</p>
<p>
In relation to the machine tool industry which is the key industrial
centre of the economy we find Mr. Asquith (the head of the biggest
machine tool company in the country, which had about 60 percent of
the market in machine tools under its control), bluntly declaring in
the <i>Annual Review</i> of the <i>Financial Times</i> 2
or 3 years ago, that it would not pay machine tool manufacturers to
automatise the production of machine tools because the market was not
big enough. As a result British machine tools production still
proceeds on the basis of batch and not mass production, and is 50
years behind the times, 50 years out of date.
</p>
<p>
The machine tool industry, which is the key industry, continues in that
particular sense, to sabotage the development of the economy in
Britain. In every other industry machine tools play their part; in
the engineering industry in particular, and now more machine tools
are imported than are exported by Britain. This is the result of the
selfish calculations of the machine tool owners, and in this respect,
they are no better and no worse than any other section of the
capitalist class. In the production of computers, which were invented
in Britain, Britain has fallen far behind her competitors, in America
in particular, but also in Germany and other countries. Now the
computer manufacturers are demanding a subsidy for improving the
production of computers, and this has just been given by the Ministry
of Technology, under Frank Cousins. This amounts to &pound;15 million.
</p>
<p>
We have the situation where Russia, Poland, East Germany and
Romania&mdash;countries 20 to 30 years ago [based on] agricultural
production&mdash;will now be producing machine tools on a mass production
basis on such a level that they will be able to flood world markets
in the next 5 to 10 years.
</p>
<p>
According to the report of a commission of American and of British professors
who examined this situation, these machine tools will be able to be
sold on the world market at 40 percent below the cost of production
in Britain.
</p>
<p>
The real decline of British capitalism, in the past the workshop of the
world, is indicated by the crisis in the balance of payments. The
British capitalists are beaten on the home market in the selling of
washing machines, TV sets and of other manufactured products. The
real cause of the crisis lies in the fact that the manufacturers in
Germany, in America and in other countries can beat the British
capitalists on the home market in Britain, by selling below the price
charged by the British, in spite of the fact that Britain, apart from
America, has the highest tariffs in the world. In shipbuilding
Britain before the First World War was the major shipbuilding nation
of the world. She has now fallen behind Germany and, in particular,
Japan.
</p>
<p>
Now, the interest on the national debt for which we are paying, not only
for the last war and the First World War, but even the Crimean War,
amounts to approximately &pound;1,000 million per year at the present
time.
</p>
<p>
This is the situation which faced the Labour government at the time it
came to power. In order to maintain some sort of competitiveness, the
ruling class tried to put the expenses of the crisis of their system
on to the shoulders of the working class. The Tories introduced the
incomes policy. The reason for this is that in a period of full
employment the working class is in a strong position. They have a
sellers&rsquo; market for the sale of their labour power. This gives the
opportunity for the working class to gain concessions and this
explains the propaganda of the capitalist press, against the unions,
against &ldquo;restrictive practices,&rdquo; in other words, those
concessions that were gained by the working class and the unions in
the last 100 years. The attempt to operate a policy of wage restraint
is precisely dictated by the enormous strength of the working class.
</p>
<h4>British
capitalism fails</h4>
<p class="fst">
The &pound;800 million adverse balance of trade was caused by the failure of
the British manufacturers to face up to competition from abroad.
After the Second World War with the first post-war majority Labour
government, we had the situation where the ruling class was compelled
to accept the nationalisation of transport, railways, gas, coal and
electricity. They reluctantly accepted this, because there was no
other way in which these industries, ruined and neglected by the
owners, could be modernised. Only the nationalisation of these
industries led to the modernisation of coal and the beginning of the
modernisation of the railways, of electricity and of gas. The reason
why the Tories only denationalised steel and road transport, was
because these industries could make a profit whereas in the other
industries no profit could be made.
</p>
<p>
When one considers the enormous sums required to modernise these
industries, it can be understood why it is that the Tories did not
suggest the de-nationalisation of the railways, which were already
being subsidised and running at a loss in the years before the Second
World War. The lies about the nationalised industries, (which have
not been sufficiently combated by the labour movement) were used for
the purpose of disseminating the myth of the efficiency of private
enterprise. Yet, even today the increase in prices of the
nationalised industries has only gone up one-third in comparison with
that of industries under so called private enterprise. In steel for
example, from having under the last Labour government the cheapest
steel (apart from South Africa and one or two other industrial
countries), British steel is now among the dearest in the world.
</p>
<p>
The basic cause of the crisis of British capitalism, a cause which is
recognised by the Tories themselves, even by the Tory leadership,
lies in the monopolisation of British industry. The British economy
is more monopolised than in any other country in the world. In the
1959 election programme of the Labour Party they referred to the 600
monopolies that controlled two thirds of the wealth of the country.
These 600 monopolies in the last few years have been reduced to 400
monopolies and these, together with the banks and the insurance
companies between them control more than two-thirds of the wealth of
the country. ICI, Lever Brothers, Prudential and others, these are
the real rulers of Britain at the present time. The Prudential
Insurance Company alone has an income of &pound;1,700 million per year,
more than the state budget of Belgium&mdash;this for one company!
</p>
<p>
These parasitic monopolies operate rings and ramps for the purpose of
maintaining artificially high prices, and it is by these means that
the inefficiencies of British capitalism have been preserved. As we
have explained, the capitalists and the Tories are not against state
intervention. They are for the intervention of the state for the
benefit of the monopolies and big business. In steel for example,
where they are opposing the nationalisation of the industry,
nevertheless the big steel plant at Colvilles was lent &pound;60 million
by the Tory government, at a nominal rate of interest, for the
purpose of building a modern steel mill. The ruling class is not
above getting national assistance from the state but instead of the
miserable handouts that are given to the sick, the old age
pensioners, and the unemployed, their national assistance, runs into
hundreds of millions of pounds. We have the scandal of the racket in
aircraft. In the last 10 years the state has provided the aircraft
industry with &pound;4,000 million out of &pound;5,000 million invested. The
state provides the money and the four big monopolies in the industry
garner the profits.
</p>
<p>
One of the main causes of the crisis of British capitalism lies in the
enormous sums of money being wasted on the armaments industry. Over
&pound;30,000 million has been wasted in a period of 20 years. This in a
vain attempt on the part of the British capitalist class to keep up
with the super powers of American imperialism on the one side, and
the, Russian bureaucracy on the other side.
</p>
<p>
In the scandal of the TSR 2 is indicated the crazy attempt of British
capitalism to maintain its power in the world through armaments. The
armaments manufacturers, and in particular the aircraft
manufacturers, are drawing enormous profits from the economy, for
goods which are obsolete almost when they come off the production
line. This would certainly have been the fate of the TSR 2, on which
&pound;1,000 million has been wasted.
</p>
<p>
Not satisfied with the enormous sums of money spent by the state on
research on which so-called private enterprise is parasitically
dependent, they are demanding more from the Labour government. What
function is fulfilled by so-called private enterprise, when all the
enterprise, all the research, and all the discovery, has to be made
from funds provided by the state? In the months and years before the
election, all of these points in one form or another were made by
Wilson, by Brown and by Callaghan. In particular, an indictment was
made of what Wilson termed the &ldquo;stop-go policy&rdquo;. The stop-go
policies Wilson pointed out, were leading to a situation where
Britain was far behind, where it was impossible to develop production
in the way it should be developed, in which the resources of the
country were not being used to their fullest extent. Wilson, Brown,
Callaghan and the other Leaders in the Cabinet at the present time,
in their indictment of the policies of the Tories, promised that this
state of affairs would be ended, that the disgrace of the 2.5 percent
increase in production on the average would be replaced by at least a
4 percent growth of the economy itself. It was on this basis that the
Labour leaders answered the jeers of the Tories as to &ldquo;where the
money was to come from&rdquo; to pay for the extensive programme of
social reforms which were announced by the Labour leaders, the
guaranteed minimum wage, guarantee of low interest rates for housing
and for mortgages, the guarantees in relation to pensions, the
building of roads, of schools and hospitals. These reforms would cost
anything from &pound;1,500 million to &pound;2,000 million. These were to be
guaranteed by the growth of industry itself.
</p>
<p>
When
the election results were announced Wilson declared (and in this he
was perfectly correct) that a majority of five was absolutely
sufficient; a majority of one would be sufficient in order to carry
out the programme which had been announced by the Labour leaders.
</p>
<p>
At
the elections the Labour Party secured a slightly lower poll than
they received in 1959 in spite of the fact that the electorate had
increased by a million or so. The reason Labour won this election was
the fall in the vote for the Tory Party, the collapse, in the Tory
vote of 2 or 3 million. These electors who had previously voted for
the Tories on the basis of the experience of the last 13 years of
Tory rule, now either abstained or went to the Liberals.
</p>
<p>
When
Wilson came to power on this basis he made it clear that his
programme would be carried out. In the eyes of these people it seemed
as if the Labour government really meant business, really meant to
carry out a radical change in the organisation of society. This had
an effect on that politically backward section of the working class
who vote for the Tories and the Liberals; it had an effect also on
some sections of the middle class, the overwhelming majority of whom
traditionally vote for the Tories. According to the Gallup poll, had
an election been held some weeks after the general election, the
Labour majority would not have been five: it would probably have been
anything up to a 100 or 150. This support was gained through the
apparent willingness of the Labour Party leadership to tackle the
ills of Britain through radical means.
</p>
<h4>&ldquo;Stop-go&rdquo;
economics</h4>
<p class="fst">
This is the tragedy of the Labour government at the present time. We
Marxists, those who support the programme of the <i>Militant</i>,
warned the labour movement in the years before the election, that so
long as 20 percent of the economy remained nationalised and 80
percent under the control of the capitalist class, the 80 percent
under the control of the capitalist class would dictate to the 20
percent under the control of the state and not vice-versa. We warned
that it was an illusion on the part of the leaders of the labour
movement that they understood capitalism better than the capitalists.
We pointed out that the indictment that was made by Wilson, Brown and
Callaghan and the other leaders of the movement against Maudling and
Selwyn-Lloyd in their &ldquo;stop-go policies&rdquo;, in their wage freezes,
in their attacks on the standards of the British people, was
incorrect. This was not caused by eccentricities of individuals. The
capitalist class, in so far as production would result in profit,
would obviously produce to the maximum extent possible, under the
conditions of private ownership of the means of production.
</p>
<p>
The crisis was not caused by individual decisions on the part of Tory
ministers. The policy that was carried out by Selwyn-Lloyd, the
policy which was carried out by Maudling, was dictated to Maudling
and Selwyn-Lloyd by the situation of British capitalism. This was not
determined by the fact that the Tories were in power. We predicted
that unless the Labour leaders were prepared to make serious inroads
into capitalism, were prepared to take action against the capitalist
class, then, inevitably they would be compelled to operate in exactly
the same way as the Tories had done; <i>we warned
that Wilson, Brown, Callaghan and the others would not dictate policy
to the economy, but on the contrary, the economy would dictate policy
to them!</i>
</p>
<p>
Now, we see the results of the attempt to compromise with the capitalist class.
The Labour leaders had announced in the period before coming to power
that by means of a gradual and slow transformation in the social
system (painlessly, apparently) gradually the conditions of the
working people would be improved, by nationalisation of steel in this
Parliament, by nationalisation perhaps of engineering in the next,
and so on. Over a period of generations, gradually the social
structure of British capitalism would be changed; gradually and
painlessly we would have a movement towards socialism in Britain.
Unfortunately it is impossible to work on this basis. The 80 percent
of the economy, the private ownership of the land, the banks, of the
most productive part of the economy in manufacturing industry, is the
determining factor in the policies of any government.
</p>
<p>
It is true that the Labour government has introduced some useful reforms
in abolishing prescription charges, in establishing security of
tenure for thousands of private tenants, and in increasing pensions,
and in this has received the backing of the whole of the labour
movement. But even in the case of pensions the 12s 6d increase had to
be postponed for six months due to the pressure of the international
bankers. During this delay costs rose enormously and partly whittled
away this increase. Needless to say no such postponement was made in
the massive increases in MP&rsquo;s salaries.
</p>
<p>
But within a few weeks of the Labour Party coming to power, they were
compelled to raise interest rates, to put a surcharge on imports
which had the immediate effect of raising the cost of living and
raising prices. Only by these means could the feeble British
manufacturers hope to put a freeze on the import of goods from
abroad. It is the import of manufactured goods which is at the root
of the problem and not at all the import of raw materials and
foodstuffs which is absolutely necessary for Britain. Britain still
remains a country which is tied, more than any other, to the world
market.
</p>
<p>
Wilson seems to imagine that to call a thing by another name changes its
nature. Lloyd and Maudling spoke of a wage freeze. Wilson put forward
the idea of an incomes and prices policy, but we see that the prices
policy announced by brother Brown is not worth the paper on which it
is written. The increase in the cost of living since the coming to
power of the Labour government has been 5 percent. A bigger increase
in a like period than within the last 10 or 15 years. It is true that
the Labour leaders were faced by deficits of &pound;800 million which had
been accumulated by the Tories in the balance of trade in the
previous years. But the only way in which they could have dealt with
this from a socialist point of view would have been by launching an
attack on capitalist ownership. Instead they attacked the standards
of the workers. They slapped down the import surcharges and then they
put &pound;600 million of taxes on the consumers. This has been followed
by further attacks.
</p>
<h4>Baying and
howling from the City</h4>
<p class="fst">
The reason why the government has had to behave in this way is because
they were not prepared to stand up to the bankers, to the
industrialists and to the vested interests of rent, interest and
profit. They have capitulated to the pressure of the capitalist
class; they have out-Selwyned Selwyn-Lloyd, they have out-Maudlinged
Maudling; they have carried on in exactly the same way as the Tories
would have done. Maudling in an indiscreet moment pointed out that in
the &ldquo;in-tray&rdquo; at the Treasury were the measures, taken by the
Labour government, that had already been prepared by the Tories if
they had won the election.
</p>
<p>
What then is the point of electing a Labour government unless the
government is prepared to take measures, drastic measures, entirely
different to the policies carried out by the ruling class themselves?
When at first it appeared that the Cabinet was not prepared to
capitulate to the pressure of big business, we had the situation
where the bankers in the City of London, where Sir Halford Reddish
launched an attack on the Labour leaders as if they were roaring red
Bolsheviks. In his annual report published in all the &ldquo;top&rdquo;
papers on May 17<sup>th</sup>
of this year Sir Halford said,
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;I
said last year that the election of a Labour government embracing
socialism would be a disaster for our country and so it has proved&hellip;If
the bath is overflowing it is not much good baling out with the soap
dish. The thing to do is turn off the tap. And the tap in this case
is excessive government expenditure. But it is difficult to imagine
any government whatever its political colour, and much less a
socialist government, resisting the temptation to bribe <i>what
is s largely an economically un-informed electorate, as long as there
is universal suffrage</i>&hellip;Our
so called full employment really conceals much under-employment, with
far too many cases of two or three men doing work which could and
should be done by one man. A little more work all round and less talk
of leisure and our export problem would soon be solved.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
In the City of London, according to the <i>Economist</i>
the bankers and the industrialists were going around bleating about
the Bolshevism of Wilson and the &ldquo;Bolshevik government&rdquo; which
existed in Britain.
</p>
<p>
They conducted a tremendous attack on the Labour government demanding that
expenditure, &ldquo;the wasteful expenditure&rdquo; of the Labour government
should be cut. More of the resources of the country should be allowed
to go to &ldquo;private enterprise&rdquo; to the industrialists, for the
purpose of investment. We see the crisis that arose at the time of
the cuts in the orders to the aircraft industry. We see what is wrong
in the attitude of the Labour leaders and of the Labour government,
in the way in which they have approached the working class on the one
side, and the way in which they have approached the ruling class on
the other. For example, at the time of the crisis, with the
cancellation of the TSR 2 contract, we had the situation of Wilson
wining and dining with the four managing directors of the four
monopolies that control the aircraft industry, to discuss the crisis
in the industry. Yet, when a shop stewards delegation of the aircraft
workers was sent to Downing Street to interview Wilson, he was &ldquo;too
busy&rdquo; to meet this delegation.
</p>
<p>
At the same time in the endeavour to maintain the position of British
capitalism, Wilson has carried out a policy that has received the
applause of all the reactionaries at home and abroad. He has
attempted to support the position of the American ruling class in
Vietnam and the reason for this is his &ldquo;East of Suez&rdquo; policy, a
policy of attempting to maintain the interests of the tin, rubber and
other monopolists in the area of Malaysia. It is this that has
dictated the policy of full support for the criminal policy of
American imperialism in Vietnam.
</p>
<p>
In the endeavour to gain the support of the trade unions, Callaghan,
Brown, and Wilson were compelled to put forward the idea of fair
shares (even then, in reality, it would have been unfair shares) and
equality of sacrifices on the part of the working class and
sacrifices on the part of the industrialists and the owners of
industry. And yet, when Callaghan as Chancellor introduced the
capital gains and corporations tax, such a howl went up on the part
of the ruling class as though they were being entirely expropriated.
Sir Halford Reddish spoke about &ldquo;theft&rdquo; being introduced by means
of taxation; and yet a similar law to that which they were intending
to introduce, had been in existence in the mighty bastion of free
enterprise, America, in the last 25 years. Yet the capitalists were
not prepared to allow even this modest measure of incursion into the
enormous super-profits that they had made in the period of the last
20 years, while Britain, from a relative point of view, has been
going down. If one examines what has happened to the capital gains
and corporation tax, to the Finance Bill, one finds that 134
amendments were introduced which entirely emasculated the Bill,
turned it into a Bill without any real content, and now the ruling
class has said that most of the demands that they were putting
forward have been agreed to in the Finance Bill.
</p>
<p>
To give one example of the amendments that have been introduced, a
maximum limit of &pound;25,000 per year in salary was suggested, as one of
the clauses, in the Finance Bill. A howl of rage on the part of
industry greeted this suggestion. As a consequence this clause has
been withdrawn, and as we have seen in the recent case of Harveys, in
which Harvey was giving himself a salary of &pound;273,000 per year plus
&pound;100,000 in expenses, now unlimited sums can be taken at the
discretion of directors and managing directors of industry. The
fantastic sum of &pound;25,000 per year was not considered sufficient.
</p>
<h4>Need for a socialist policy</h4>
<p class="fst">
If one examines the problems of the last 20 years, one can see that the
terrible decline of British capitalism has partly been disguised by
the economic upswing of world capitalism that has taken place. The
fall of British exports would have led to catastrophe in this country
had it not been that world trade has enormously increased. <i>It
is a smaller share of a bigger cake that is being received by the
capitalist class</i>. The decline of British
capitalism still continues and unless the labour movement is prepared
to take real action against the capitalist class, then we will
rapidly have the situation of Britain being turned into another Spain
with all that that would mean in the decline of the standards of
living of the people, and of the working class. The <i>New
York Times</i> and the <i>Herald Tribune,</i> the allies of British capitalism
abroad, have openly speculated on British capitalism following the
path of Spain. After the loss of her Empire she declined, remaining
stagnant economically, socially, industrially and in every other way.
</p>
<p>
But in the small island of Britain which depends on trade for her
livelihood this would mean terrible conditions and terrible standards
for the working people. And yet, this situation is entirely
unnecessary; this situation is entirely due to the selfish interests,
the &ldquo;private-unenterprise&rdquo; interests of the capitalist class.
</p>
<p>
The Labour leaders spoke in the past about the need to &ldquo;conciliate&rdquo;
the middle class. They demanded a watering down, a dilution of the
socialist programme of Labour. Yet when the representatives of
500,000 shopkeepers recently sent a delegation to the Board of Trade
to complain about the racket of the manufacturers who waste hundreds
of millions of pounds on advertising schemes, they were not received.
This was at a time when the small shopkeepers were made scapegoats
for the big increase in retail prices. An abolition of the free gifts
racket could lead to a cut in the cost of living of 1s 0d or 2s 0d in
the pound. Douglas Jay, also, was &ldquo;too busy&rdquo; to meet this
delegation, yet he can always find time to meet the representatives
of big combines, of the big supermarkets, in discussing problems of
this particular character.
</p>
<p>
How then is the labour movement to face up to the crisis of British
capitalism? How then is the labour movement to convince the
politically backward sections of the working class who vote for the
Tories? How to convince those sections of the middle class who have
traditionally voted for the government of big business? These
sections of the people vote for their worst enemies, for the
exploiters of the people, for the agents of big business only because
they do not see any real alternative, they do not see any way out of
the situation, in which they find themselves. In the past, as any
discussion on the knocker, in door to door canvassing would reveal,
they have put forward the idea that if a capitalist policy is to be
operated, then obviously the capitalists are the people to carry it
out; &ldquo;they have the money, they own the business, they have the
education, and they know how to rule&rdquo;; that is the argument that
has been put forward by Tory workers and by the middle class in the
past. The only way in which to convince these people would be by
means of demonstrating in practise that the Labour government and the
labour movement stands for the interests of the people, and is
prepared to take drastic measures against big business. This is the
only way in which the problem can be solved. Lenin, who in his day
was no mean theorist, once pointed out that an ounce of experience is
worth a ton of theory in convincing the masses of people of the
advantages of socialism over capitalism, of the advantages of the
ownership of the means of production by the people over capitalist
ownership of the means of production.
</p>
<p>
How then to face up to the problem? The only way in which a plan could
really be operated in the interests of the people, the only way in
which a plan could work would be by taking over industry. Let us
remember that at a time of boom during the last 20 years there has
been so-called, &ldquo;spare capacity&rdquo;, and there is spare capacity in
many industries, even at the present time. The reason why there is
this spare capacity is that the capitalists would not make a profit
by producing the maximum quantity of goods. The market is not big
enough, either at home or abroad. Therefore, they will not produce
the goods which are necessary and which are required.
</p>
<p>
If the Labour leaders were prepared to carry through the nationalisation
of the joint stock banks, the nationalisation of the insurance
companies and the nationalisation of the 400 monopolies that control
two-thirds of the wealth of this country, then the situation could be
radically transformed.
</p>
<h4>For a socialist plan of production</h4>
<p class="fst">
What is necessary, is for the labour movement to announce a plan of
production. To get the engineers, the technicians and the scientists
to draw up a plan on the basis of the resources of the country and to
draw into this plan not only the people at the top but the working
class at the bottom; shop stewards, the representatives of the trade
unions, of the technicians, of the small business people, of the
small shopkeepers, of professional people, of housewives.
Representatives of the overwhelming majority of the population in
Britain should be drawn democratically into the discussion of the
plan and of how the plan should be worked. The small farmers should
be given cheap credits, the small shopkeepers also, housing loans
should be granted on nominal interest, council housing free of
interest, if the labour movement is not prepared to take this action
then they have to retreat to Tory policies. The Labour leaders have
been routed by big business. The measures for the control of the
economy that they have announced are drastic measures to try and keep
down the wages of the working class, drastic measures which will mean
enormously increased profits for the capitalists. They have retreated
even on the issue of immigration, on the issue of the 800,000 or so
coloured workers who came to this country in the search for &ldquo;decent
conditions&rdquo;, in the search for employment, in the search for a
reasonable standard of living. The capitalist class have used these
workers in their own interests. Without coloured labour the transport
system in this country would break down; the hospitals would break
down. Only by the use of coloured labour have the hospitals and the
transport system been able to continue to function as they have done
in the last ten years.
</p>
<p>
Now, having used these workers for the purpose of obtaining profit, the
capitalist class is quite prepared to appeal to the worst forms of
racial prejudice, to the worst forms of chauvinism for the purpose of
protecting their profit system.
</p>
<p>
If at a time when the working class is relatively quiescent, if, at a
time when the capitalist class is still continuing to pile up
enormous profits&mdash;for the purpose of gaining power for the Tory
Party&mdash;such gentlemen as Sir Alec Douglas Home, Enoch Powell, the
so-called man of integrity, Selwyn-Lloyd and other leaders of the
Tory Party, are prepared to make use of racial prejudice for the
purpose of gaining control, what would they do under conditions when
the economy is no longer going forward?
</p>
<p>
What then is to happen, when, instead of the 20 years economic upswing
that we have seen in the last period, this will be succeeded by a
downswing of capitalism?
</p>
<p>
If the reforms which were promised by the Labour leaders, cannot be
carried out at a time of boom on the world market, at a time of an
increase of world trade, what will happen to this programme of
reforms at a time of world recession?
</p>
<p>
The speeches of representatives of the ruling class, of Mr. McChesney,
the Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank in Washington, and of other
sober representatives of the capitalists have warned of the dangers
of a new and deep economic recession, in the years that lie ahead. A
new 1929 is quite likely to take place. The capitalist class have no
confidence in the development of their own system and if the Labour
leaders cannot cope with the situation when world capitalism is going
forward, if they cannot cope with this situation except by taking
capitalist measures, what would be the situation if they were faced
with a new and deeper economic slump? If they behave and they will
behave in the way that they have, on the basis of the crisis of the
economy, we will have a similar situation which existed at the time
of the MacDonald government of 1929-31 with all the consequences that
that was to have for the labour movement. And yet, this situation is
entirely unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
The <i>Financial Times</i>
pointed out more than 6 months ago the impossibility of carrying
through the programme that the Labour leaders had suggested on the
basis of the situation which existed in the economy. Yet if one
examines the programme put forward by the Labour leaders, if one
examines this year&rsquo;s agenda of the Labour Party conference one sees
how the workers are demanding measures in relation to education,
measures in relation to housing, measures in relation to the social
services and education which should be easily realisable, but cannot
be realised whilst the capitalist system remains in control, while
capitalism is still in existence. Even in relation to the problem of
housing for example, before the war, Britain had actually reached the
production of 450,000 houses a year, now the Labour government has
set itself a target of 400,000 houses.
</p>
<p>
This in spite of the fact that the population of Britain in the
intervening period has increased by some 14 million, by more than 25
percent, so that with an increased population, less houses are being
built. Even capitalist Germany is building 800,000 houses per year at
the present time. And in the Soviet Union, in spite of its former
backwardness, in spite of all the difficulties, in spite of
dictatorial control, nevertheless in the field of housing, they are
building more houses than the whole of Western Europe, Britain and
America combined. The reason why they can accomplish this is the
reason why it is necessary to take measures against capitalism. What
stands in the way of a housing programme is not at all that the
resources are not there, but the interests of the financiers, of the
landlords, of the landowners, the vested interests of the building
employers, all these stand in the way of the production of housing
<i>when all the resources for the production of
houses are there</i>.
</p>
<p>
To give one example, when the Corporation of Liverpool wished to borrow
&pound;12 million (and that was before the recent freeze on borrowing
activities by the councils was put on by the government), they were
told that they would have to pay back &pound;50 million, i.e. &pound;38 million
in interest&mdash;of assured interest, of assured profit for the
parasites of finance capital. And yet, it is on the housing question
that racialism is based. Instead of the Labour government bowing
before the pressure of the racialists, bowing before the pressure of
the capitalist class; they should have developed a housing programme
of 800,000 or even a million houses a year. This would be entirely
possible if one could cut through the entanglement of the vested
interests of the capitalists.
</p>
<p>
Then the racial question could never be raised. It is only the existence
of slums and overcrowding, which are a consequence of capitalism,
which make this racial poison necessary to the capitalist class. It
is not generally realised that Britain still remains one of the
wealthiest countries in the world. The amount of wealth that is in
existence in the land, the factories and the other resources of
production, amounts to more than &pound;100,000 million. If the Labour
leaders were really doing the job which they should be doing, they
would have explained the crisis to the working class that exists at
the present time. 
</p>
<p>
In millions of copies they would have published the statement of Sir
Halford Reddish which openly declares the hatred of the capitalists
against the labour movement and its programme. They should have
published this in millions of copies to indicate the real attitude of
the ruling class. Quotations of what Sir Halford really stands for
have already been given in this pamphlet.
</p>
<h4>Plenty for all</h4>
<p class="fst">
At the same time, is it necessary to freeze the wages of the workers? Is
it necessary in solving the problems of production to hold the
workers in check? The experts of the ruling class have declared that
three or four million workers are redundant in the factories at the
present time, that the same amount of production could be achieved
with three or four million workers less, and this explains the
attitude of the ruling class on this question.
</p>
<p>
If they have not sacked this number of workers at the present time, it
is because of their fear of the social consequences, that that would
provoke, not at all any fear of the misery that this would mean to
the mass of the working people. Whenever they have tried the policy
of sackings, whether in Nottingham, whether in Glasgow, whether in
Wales, or Birmingham, or any other area of the country, they have met
the justified resistance of the workers who do not wish to see their
brothers, their mates, their comrades &ldquo;on the stones&rdquo; as the
expression would have it, living on the pittance of unemployment pay.
</p>
<p>
And yet, the resources of the country are there to guarantee a full life
for all, and this is the conclusion not only from socialist sources
but from capitalist sources as well. In the <i>Sunday
Times</i> a little before the election of the
Labour government, there appeared two articles by an efficiency
expert, an American, not at all a socialist or a Marxist. In this he
pointed to the millions of workers who were redundant in the
factories at the present time; he showed that by organising
production more efficiently, by imitating the so-called restrictive
practices of the workers and the restrictive practices of management,
it should be possible to increase production immediately by about 50
percent. At the same time it would be possible to lower the hours of
work in the factories to 4 hours per day and increase production not
at the miserly and miserable figure of 4 percent per year which
British capitalism has not been able to realise (this is the target
put forward by Wilson and the Labour leaders), but a production
target of 12 percent per year. He could not understand why production
could not be organised on this basis, he could not understand the
nature of the system.
</p>
<p>
If industry had to be operated on the basis of a plan, if we had
nationalisation with compensation on the basis of need, it would be
possible to increase standards of living and guarantee abundance for
all. The miserable pittance given to the old age pensioners, the
miserable pittance given to injured workers, the miserable treatment
of the sick and the unemployed; the working class would treat even
the parasites of the capitalist class far more generously than that.
Compensation should be on the basis of need with a maximum of &pound;20 or
&pound;25 per week.
</p>
<p>
If automation is to be introduced into the economy for the benefit of
the working class and not to introduce more suffering for the
workers, it will be necessary to nationalise these industries and to
operate industry on the basis of a plan. Organising production
democratically, with the control of industry and of the state, by the
masses of the people themselves, it will be possible to increase
production in Britain by 20 per cent a year; to lower the hours of
work and to build a paradise nationally and then later
internationally. What is the alternative? Automation in America is
already wiping out more than 2 million jobs a year and that is the
explanation of the unemployment of 5 million or so in America, in
spite of the enormous increases in production which have taken place
in the last few years. Wilson, in his speech in Birmingham, warned
the country and warned the labour movement that a drastic process of
automatisation of industry could lead to 7 million unemployed in
Britain by 1970 and to 30 million unemployed in America.
</p>
<h4>For an alternative to Toryism</h4>
<p class="fst">
The labour movement must offer the people a clear alternative to
capitalism, must offer a genuine socialist programme; this is the
only way in which the labour movement can guarantee the development
of society and the further progress of the movement.
</p>
<p>
After nearly a year of the Labour government, instead of the labour
movement being on top, we have a new access of confidence on the part
of the ruling class, and on the part of their representatives, the
Tories. The dropping of Home and his replacement by Heath was
intended as a measure to prepare for an attack on the working class,
and as an attack on the conditions and standards of the working
people; <i>to be more accurate, to resist any
improvement in the standards of the people</i>.
</p>
<p>
In the pages of the <i>Financial Times,</i> the<i> Times</i>, the
<i>Economist</i> and other
journals of big business we had the complaint that the Labour
government had failed to establish an &ldquo;incomes policy&rdquo;, by
incomes policy they meant a limitation of the incomes of the working
class. Therefore they said, the next Tory government would have to
take &ldquo;other measures&rdquo;. By other measures they meant restriction
of the rights of the working class, they meant the restriction of the
rights of the trade unions, a limitation of the right to strike,
drastic measures to limit the powers of the unions, as they have been
limited in America, with the Taft-Hartley Act.
</p>
<p>
The only way out of this impasse for the labour movement is to carry out
a programme of real socialist measures on the lines that have been
sketched in this pamphlet.
</p>
<p>
In the months and the years that lie ahead it will be demonstrated that
this is the only means by which housing, social services, education,
production, the enlightenment of the people can be obtained, that
only by socialist methods, only by taking action on these lines can
the labour movement save itself from destruction.
