<p class="fst">The war between Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands is a symptom of the
world crisis of capitalism. The international economic recession has ushered in a new
epoch of upheavals, which will mean mighty clashes between the classes and conflicts
between the nation states. Class conflicts will interact with national conflicts,
aggravating one another.</p>


<p>A Marxist attitude towards war cannot be dictated by the horrors of war, by the
suffering and death, or by the nightmare conditions inevitably imposed on both civilians
and the ranks of the armed forces. War merely carries the horrors of capitalism to their
ultimate extent. Our attitude towards war is determined by the class interests of those
waging the war. In the modern epoch, wars are determined by the power, profit, and
prestige of the ruling classes; and also by the power, income, and privileges of the
ruling bureaucracies in the deformed workers' states of Russia, Eastern Europe, China and
the other Stalinist countries. The working class of all countries has nothing to gain from
capitalism and its policies, either in peace or war. War is the continuation of politics
by other means, and, nowadays, peace is the continuation of war by other means.</p>


<p>The Marxist attitude is determined by irreconcilable opposition to any war waged by the
capitalist ruling class. Our attitude to war between Britain and Argentina is determined
by which class is waging the war. On both sides it is capitalist powers which are
involved, and therefore we are opposed to the war of both Britain and of Argentina.</p>


<p>Why has war broken out now? Argentina has laid claim to the Falkland Islands for 150
years, yet has not dared to take action before now. It is the uncontrollable social
contradictions in Argentina which have dictated the resort to arms by the Junta, which
heads a military Bonapartist regime, using fascist methods. In the same way, it was the
social crisis in Germany which pushed Hitler into war. Lurking under the phrases about
&quot;national sovereignty&quot; is the capitalists' greed for the potentially profitable
oil, fish and mineral wealth of Antarctica. The Junta believes that the exploitation of
Antarctica, probably as a junior partner of American capital, would provide the additional
support for the Argentine economy and augment the income of big business. They imagine
that this would be a means of solving Argentina's aggravated social crisis.</p>


<p>Even so, that is not the main reason for the seizure of the Falklands. Argentina was
facing the beginning of revolutionary developments. Only a few days before the invasion,
there were mass demonstrations of the workers against the Junta in Buenos Aires. To escape
the social crisis the Argentinean dictatorship decided on the seizure of the Falklands in
a desperate attempt to divert the social strivings of the masses into nationalist
channels. This was their calculation. The mass fervour in Argentina over the seizure of
the Malvinas indicates that, temporarily, the Junta has succeeded in diverting the
workers' anger against British imperialism. The Junta's motives in waging this war,
therefore, are determined by capitalist considerations of grabbing resources and escaping
from intolerable social contradictions.</p>


<p>Marxists have always distinguished between wars waged by capitalism and wars waged by a
workers' state, deformed or healthy. In the Second World War (1939-45), the only country
to which the Marxists gave critical support was the Soviet Union. This was in spite of the
most monstrous totalitarian dictatorship of the Stalinist bureaucracy whose privilege and
income was based on the state ownership of the means of production and a plan, which they
were therefore forced to defend. The deformed workers' state in Russia was relatively more
progressive than capitalism. A victory for Hitler would have ushered in an entire epoch of
counter-revolution. Thus Marxists gave critical support to the war of Russia against Nazi
Germany. They also gave critical support to China, a colonial country in its war against
Japan which seized Manchuria in 1931 and engaged in a war with China in 1937-1945. This
was despite the fact that the butcher of the Chinese revolution of 1925-27, the
Bonapartist dictator Chiang Kai-Shek, controlled China. While supporting China, the
Marxists pointed out the complete incapacity of Chiang and the landlord-capitalist regime
to wage war on Japan. In the case of the Second World War the so-called defence of
democracy by the American and European Allies were shot through with hypocrisy and deceit.
In reality, they were defending the material interest of the capitalist class. The war was
fought for markets, raw materials, colonies, and spheres of influence. The Marxists,
therefore, opposed all the imperialist powers in the war. This, however, did not exhaust
the problem - as we will explain in a moment - because of the British workers' deep-rooted
hatred of the Nazis and their support for a fight to defeat the fascist regime.</p>


<p>In 1935-36 Mussolini, Italy's fascist dictator, invaded Abyssinia (now called Ethiopia)
in the interests of Italian capitalism. Despite the existence of chattel slavery in
Abyssinia, Trotsky advocated support for Abyssinia in a war of national liberation from
the imperialist power out to enslave the country. The position of the ILP (Independent
Labour Party) leaders like John McGovern and James Maxton, advocating 'no support for
either of the dictators,' was rejected by the Marxists. Marxism always supports the poor,
the oppressed, and the enslaved in their struggle against the rich and powerful
imperialist states. At the same time, a powerful consideration was that a defeat for the
Italian capitalist and fascist invaders would undoubtedly have provoked a proletarian
revolution in Italy.</p>


<p>A Marxist attitude can never be determined by the question of who started the war. The
labour leaders, both left and right, are obsessed with defining the 'aggressor' as a means
of determining their attitude. This has led the leaders of the Labour Party into a
position where they are trailing behind the Tory government.</p>


<p>The decisive question is: which class is waging the war and in whose interest? The
method of reasoning which starts from who attacked first is completely shallow. There are
many cases in history where war has been provoked by one or other power. Our attitude is
determined by the class interests of the powers involved in the war.</p>


<p>The ultra-left sects of various descriptions have - quite predictably! - supported
Argentina on the grounds that it is a colonial country faced with imperialist aggression.
That is nonsense, and shows a completely undialectical approach. Argentina is one of the
most highly developed countries in Latin America. Her landowners are not feudal but
bourgeois landowners comparable to the capitalist landowners in Britain. Eighty-six
percent of the population live in the towns, and the country has a reasonably developed
industry. Finance capital, both foreign and local, is intertwined with the bourgeois
landowners and the capitalists in the cities. Whoever heard of a colonial country with a
stock exchange! The Argentine has a similar basis to that of the United States. The
settlers exterminated the local Indian population, and started out with bourgeois
relations, rather than those of feudalism, although Argentina, of course, is not as highly
developed as the United States. The regime's motives are not at all those of defending the
rights of the workers and farmers, or rather, agricultural proletariat, but of defending
the interests of Argentine big business and the country's highly developed finance
capital.</p>


<p>On the Falkland Islands themselves, the Argentine presence consisted of one Argentine
married to a Falkland Islander who fled from the Islands when he saw the possibility of
war. Had there been a colony of, say, 100,000 Argentines, a case for colonial oppression
could have been made out. But the Islands have been in British possession for 150 years.
There was a fleeting Argentine garrison for only a few months before that, which was
expelled by the British. The population of the Islands is English-speaking and of British
descent.</p>


<p>Although there are only 1,800 Falkland Islanders, Marxists nevertheless have to take
into consideration their rights and interests. The Junta's claim to the Falklands is
purely an imperialist claim for loot in the shape of resources which can be developed,
although even this is secondary to their aim of heading off revolution by diverting
workers along nationalist lines. Had the Junta weighed up the chances of successfully
taking the Falklands, they would not have struck now, but would have waited for another 12
months. By that time, Britain's aircraft carriers, frigates, and the vulcan bombers would
have been scrapped, and Britain would not have had the means of resisting the seizure of
the Islands. But the hot breath of revolution forced the Junta to act prematurely. The
decisive factor was their fear of revolution. And yet, the ultra-left sects are completely
unaware of this fact.</p>


<p>The attitude of the Marxists towards this war is decided by all these considerations,
and above all by the fact that it is two imperialist powers which are at war, even though
the Argentine may in the past have been, like the United States, a colonial country.
Therefore we oppose the capitalist war of Argentina against Britain, and we oppose the
capitalist war of Britain against Argentina.</p>


<p>Certain of the ultra-left sects have quoted an isolated passage from Trotsky's comments
in 1938 on the position of Marxists in the event of a war between Brazil and Britain,
without taking his remarks in their context. All the circumstances of a conflict must be
taken into account. Trotsky was dealing with a possible attempt by British capitalism to
colonise Brazil. Brazil could hardly attack Britain! In that event, as with Chiang
Kai-Shek or the Negus of Abyssinia, it would have been correct to give critical support to
the Vargas dictatorship, though not the uncritical support given to the Argentine
dictatorship by the sects. The Argentine is a capitalist country, and its seizure of the
Falklands - or Malvinas, which they have not held for 150 years - is an imperialist
adventure, just as the reaction of Britain is an imperialist adventure. In this war, a
defeat for Argentina will provoke the revolution. If the Task Force is defeated, on the
other hand, it will mean the downfall of the Thatcher government. Either result would be
in the interests of the working class internationally. After his comment on Brazil,
Trotsky goes on to say, &quot;Truly, one must have an empty head to reduce antagonisms and
military conflicts to the struggle between fascism and democracy. Under all masks one must
know how to distinguish exploiters, slave-owners, and robbers.&quot;</p>


<p>The stupidity of the Thatcher government, even from a capitalist point of view, has
been clearly revealed. As a client state of United States imperialism, British capitalism
was obsessed with the struggle against Stalinist Russia. They decided virtually to scrap
most of the navy, and even much of the airforce, and to rely purely upon Trident missiles,
against what they considered their main enemy, the Soviet Union. The stupidity and
unpreparedness of the British ruling class was revealed by the Junta's invasion, which
took the Tory government completely by surprise. However, the attitude of different
sections of the British ruling class is not clear. Finance capital has heavy investments
in Argentina, and this is reflected in the lukewarm attitude of the <em>Financial Times </em>to
the response of Thatcher's Government.</p>


<p>There have been reports in both the serious and the gutter press that the Foreign
Office was well aware of the plans for the invasion, but did nothing about them.
Apparently, the Foreign Office, and possibly Carrington, miscalculated. They may have
believed that they would be able to arrive at some sort of agreement with the Junta after
the seizure of the Islands. They were not averse to helping to prop up the Junta by giving
them a foreign policy success. But they had forgotten that prestige is an important factor
in relations between states and nations, over and above immediate material considerations.
The power of British imperialism in its diplomatic dealings would have been completely
undermined if they had just accepted the invasion tamely. This is why there was an outcry
in Parliament and in the press about the 'national humiliation'. The Tory government,
therefore, rapidly assembled and dispatched the Task Force, the biggest war fleet
assembled by British capitalism since the Second World War. However, as far as the Junta
was concerned, once they had taken the step of seizing the Islands it was extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to draw back.</p>


<p>Thatcher and the Tory Government did not seek a conflict with the Bonapartist
military-police dictatorship. Like Reagan, Thatcher wishes to prop up every reactionary
regime: that of Chile, Turkey, and other dictatorships throughout the world. But once
Galtieri seized the Falklands the Tories had no choice. It is with regret that Thatcher
sees that the defeat of the Argentine regime will result in the collapse of Galtieri and
the Junta. It is with complete hypocrisy that they have 'just discovered' that the regime
is dictatorial, denouncing it as 'fascist' in order to justify war against the Argentine.
In Britain, finance capital was not pleased with the policy of their government. In
America, on the other hand, British diplomacy out-manoeuvred Reagan, who has a hankering
to support the dictatorial regimes in Latin America, by winning over Republican and
Democrat representatives in the House and Senate of Congress. The press in America from
the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>to <em>The Village Voice </em>is unanimously in favour
of British capitalism. This reflects the American bourgeoisie's decisive interests, which
are bound up with NATO and the European allies.</p>


<p>The events in the South Atlantic have ruined all the carefully laid plans of Reagan and
American imperialism. Their policy has been to prop up the dictatorships in Latin America
against the social revolution. But American imperialism was put in the position where two
client states, Galtieri on the one hand and Thatcher on the other, refused to accept the
demands of American imperialism. Twenty-four hours before the invasion took place,
Galtieri rejected American demands to call it off. Thatcher also rejected the suggestions
for a compromise from American imperialism. The fall of the Junta would prepare explosions
throughout the length and breadth of Latin America. That is the fear of Reagan. On the
other hand, American imperialism could not, in the last analysis, refuse to support the
Thatcher government. To have done so would have ruined NATO as well!</p>


<p>Reluctantly, as a last resort, they have had to back British imperialism against
Argentina.</p>


<p>British imperialism's position cannot benefit the working class. Its reaction to the
seizure of the Falklands is dictated by considerations of prestige, and also by the wealth
of Antarctica and the oil and fish around the Islands themselves. The Falklands are the
gateway to Antarctica, and South Georgia is the entrance to the Southern Polar Continent.
That is why Britain has seized the Dependency of South Georgia, and formalistically draws
a legalistic distinction between South Georgia and the Falklands, though they have always
been lumped together in the past, 'for administrative convenience'. After the resort to
arms, British imperialism will consider that this is a decisive way of settling the issue.
No further claim by Argentina will even be considered. For a whole historical epoch the
question will be closed. If Britain takes back the Islands, British capitalism will then
begin to develop the resources of the Antarctic, particularly around the Falklands, in a
measurable period of time. These are the real war aims of British capitalism. Like all
regimes, including that of the Argentine, they are interested in power, profits,
privilege, and prestige and that is what dictates their policies.</p>


<p>As always, the right-wing labour leaders have come out in support of British capitalism
and imperialism in its hour of need. The Parliamentary leaders of the Labour Party gave
immediate support to the sending of the Task Force and the seizure of South Georgia. Foot
and Healey have compromised themselves with the Tories. Their opposition is of the
faintest character, completely lacking the realities of a class opposition. While
supporting the sending of the Task Force, they still insist on a diplomatic solution to
resolve what is now insoluble except through the 'arbitration' of force. Neither side can
back down. If the Junta were now to relinquish the Falklands, it would face immediate
downfall and would even prefer the risk of defeat in war. The Thatcher Government is in
the same position. Acceptance of defeat would mean the collapse of the Government, and the
ruin of British imperialism's diplomatic power.</p>


<p>The Task Force has been sent not to roll Easter eggs at Easter, not merely for a
display of force, but to go to war if the enemy does not back down. The leaders of the
Labour Party put themselves in a ridiculous position by supporting the sending of the Task
Force but opposing its use. To safeguard its interests internationally, British
imperialism, now a decadent and declining power, is fully prepared to undertake the
adventure of war.</p>


<p>The opposition in the Labour Party of Tony Benn, Judith Hart, and others, is, in
reality, purely pacifist. Tony Benn has put a very courageous position, but without
thinking things through to a conclusion. Their opposition towards war will have some
effect on the active layers of the Labour Party, and particularly on working women who
fear for the lives which will be lost and the suffering that will inevitably be caused by
war. Within the Labour Party there is a strong instinctive hatred of war, and a big
majority of the active workers have a hatred of the Tory government. But the pacifist
opposition of the labour lefts is not opposition to the class which wages the war, and nor
is it directed against the aims of that class in waging a war. It is futile opposition
which, once the war takes on bigger dimensions, can play into the hands of the
imperialists. The demand for the 'withdrawal of the fleet', first put forward by the
so-called 'Communist' Party, and then echoed by Tony Benn, Judith Hart and other Labour
left wingers, is a meaningless, pacifist gesture. Naturally, the sects enthusiastically
follow the Communist Party into this pacifist blind alley. How could the demand for the
fleet to be withdrawn be accomplished? By asking Thatcher? She would merely shrug her
shoulders and laugh. Throughout history, pacifist demands, to 'stop the war', to halt
military mobilisation, or to withdraw the fleet, have never had any effect. The Communist
Party is too cowardly, and the sects too stupid to think things through to a conclusion.
In order to get the fleet withdrawn a general strike would be required, and not only a
general strike, but also an insurrection. There would be no other means of attaining it.
But such demands could get no echo from the mass of workers, or from any section of the
labour movement. It would be ludicrous to put forward such demands. It is true that no war
could be waged without the support of the trade union and labour leaders. But most of them
are actually supporting the action of the Thatcher government. It would be absurd to call
for a general strike at the present time. But this means that the call for withdrawal of
the fleet is even more absurd. Marxists do not put forward slogans which are meaningless,
and they do not put forward ideas that will not raise the level of the active layers of
the labour and trade union movement and of the working class as a whole.</p>


<p>However, the second line of defence, for both the right and the left trade union
leaders is to appeal to the United Nations, which should really be called the dis-United
Nations.</p>


<p>The whole history of the post-war period has indicated that the United Nations can only
solve secondary problems, which are of secondary consideration to the states involved. If
the super powers and other powers are united, perhaps some issues can be resolved. Even
then, however, it will not be successful if one of the parties is strong enough to flout
the (dis-)United Nations. Since the end of the Second World War, there has been a series
of wars of a 'minor' type which the United Nations has been unable to prevent or bring to
a halt. In fact, since 1945 there have only been about 17 days of peace. There has been a
war, or civil war raging, mainly in the third world, every day. The United Nations has
been powerless to prevent them.</p>


<p>The United Nations is composed of imperialist powers, the Stalinist deformed workers'
states, and the ex-colonial countries. They are inevitably riven with national and class
antagonisms. If there is a unity of gangsters, does it mean that if one gangster falls out
of line, there will not be a gangster conflict? The history of the Mafia in Italy, and the
Chicago gangsters in America, shows that a union of gangsters breaks down the moment one
of them finds that his interests are not being served by an uneasy agreement. The General
Assembly of the United Nations can no more serve as a classless, impartial assembly, than
the parliaments or assemblies of the member states, which are themselves divided into
classes or ruled over by privileged elites. The major powers which form the Security
Council, moreover, each have a veto and can vote down any action, or even declaration, by
the United Nations. The attitude of the labour leaders on this question stems from the
failure to understand that society is divided into classes, and also divided into nations,
on which those classes are based. The class struggle is both national and international.
Marxists explain that the labour movement must understand that it can no more have any
confidence in the Tories' foreign policy than it has in the Tories' home policy. Foreign
policy is the continuation of home policy - it is based on exactly the same class
considerations.</p>


<p>The task of Marxists is first to raise the level of understanding of the advanced
layers of the working class active in the trade unions, the shop stewards committees and
the Labour Party. This can only be done on the basis of a clear analysis of the class
interests of the capitalist powers.</p>


<p>Britain's capitalist allies in the European Economic Community have now unanimously
supported Britain against Argentina. This is to demonstrate the solidarity of the EEC
powers, but above all they have adopted economic sanctions for military reasons, showing
their support for NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Nominally, at least, they
have implemented a ban on imports from Argentina, and if it comes to decisive battles,
American imperialism will reluctantly have to do the same. Sanctions, however, even though
they could be a severe blow to the Argentine economy cannot prevent the Junta from going
to war because Galtieri fears his regime will collapse if he does not take a stand and
defend the seizure of the Falklands.</p>


<p>The retaking of South Georgia gives British imperialism a supply base for navy and for
the troops. But it seems that Thatcher and the Tory Government have pressing reasons for
undertaking immediate action in relation to the Falklands themselves. From the point of
view of military strategy it would have been better to build up a base on South Georgia.
But even though a delay of six to nine months could prepare the way for the partial
collapse of the Argentine economy the Tory Government is not prepared to wait. The Tories
fear that it may be difficult to maintain morale for six months, or a year, or more. It
therefore appears that the Thatcher government is prepared to risk everything on a quick
ending of the conflict through an assault on the Falkland Islands. The navy, part of the
airforce and sections of the regular army, together with special forces, (the SAS, the
Commandos, the Special Boat Service) will be used in an attempt to retake the Islands.
Nevertheless, this will be a minor war for Britain, whereas it is a major war for
Argentina.</p>


<h4>The role of Marxism in Argentina</h4>

<p>In Argentina, the role of Marxists must be skillfully to oppose the war. They will
expose the inconsistencies of the Junta, showing the mess which the capitalist officer
caste have made of the economy. The Junta has, temporarily, been able to divert the
Argentine masses on nationalist lines. But the Marxists will demonstrate the incapacity of
the officer caste to fight a revolutionary war, without which it is virtually ruled out
that Argentina could defeat Britain, which is still a relatively powerful imperialist
power. Why does the Junta fight with kid gloves? The Argentine capitalists, on whose
interests the Junta rests, are linked to American and British finance capital. Marxists in
the Argentine will demand the expropriation, first of British investments, and then of all
foreign capital in the country.</p>


<p>They will demand that Argentina be handed back to the Argentines: that is the
expropriation of both landed and industrial capital. They will show the privileges and
incompetence of the rotten upper strata of the officer caste, and their military
incompetence. Without the genuine planning of industry, and fair rationing and
distribution of goods for all, it would be impossible to wage an effective war. The
Marxists would criticise the entirely selfish aims of the Junta and the Argentine
capitalists, whose aim, if they hold the Falklands, would be to reap profits, as junior
partners of American imperialism, at the expense of the working class. The Marxists would
explain that victory over the powerful imperialist Britain could not be gained by military
means, especially under the direction of the totalitarian Junta, but only through
political and social means. An overthrow of the Junta by the workers and the establishment
of a socialist Argentina would be the most powerful weapon against all imperialism,
especially British and American. The Argentine working class could then appeal to the
labour movement and the workers and soldiers of Britain. The workers of Argentina would
then suggest a socialist federation of Argentina, the Falklands, and of a socialist
Britain. A socialist government in the Argentine would then point out that the Falklands
issue has been magnified out of all proportion by generations of Argentine capitalists for
their own ends. They would appeal to the workers of all Latin America to overthrow the
economic yoke of capitalism and imperialism, and to overthrow their own Juntas, and to
prepare for a socialist federation of Latin America. The Junta's aims cannot be the aims
of the working class, either in home or foreign policy. For the capitalists, war will be
profitable. For the workers and soldiers, the war will mean bloodshed and suffering. In
the course of a long war, if the present conflict were to be prolonged, Marxist ideas of
this sort would receive enormous support in Argentina and throughout Latin America. The
overthrow of the Junta would mark the beginning of a socialist revolution in Argentina,
though because of the absence of a Marxist leadership it would in the beginning take a
distorted Peronist form.</p>


<p>Truth is always concrete. In any particular conflict, Marxists have always analysed all
the strands of the class and national conflicts that have resulted in a war. War in the
South Atlantic will have incalculable consequences in Argentina and Latin America, but
also in Britain and Europe. Whatever the outcome of the war, Thatcher will probably be
ousted as Tory leader within the next six or nine months, just as Carrington was
eliminated as a result of his mistakes in the Foreign Office. Pym will probably be pushed
forward as the next leader and Prime Minister.</p>


<p>Thatcher and the Tories pretend that the Falkland Islanders and their wishes are their
first consideration. In reality, it is the last thing they are concerned about. If it were
in the interests of British imperialism, they would sacrifice the interests of the
Islanders without blinking an eyelid. It is the prestige of British imperialism and the
prospect of exotic riches in the Antarctic, not the interests of the Islanders, which
determine the policy of the Tory Government. The Second World War supposedly broke out
over the city of Danzig, which was seized by force by the Nazis. In reality, however, it
was considerations of markets, raw materials, colonial possessions, and spheres of
influence which were the main cause of the war. The 1,800 Falklanders are just pawns in
the game as far as British imperialism are concerned. If they launch an assault now it
will be a desperate move on the part of British imperialism, though it is not ruled out
that they could gain victory through a quick kill. The British troops are highly trained
professionals, and the British navy is still the third most powerful in the world. The
British forces are immensely powerful, and are equipped with sophisticated technological
weapons and defences. The morale of the troops is apparently high.</p>


<p>Marxists must explain that it is the dialectical contradictions, nationally and
internationally, which have resulted in this war. It is necessary patiently to explain
that the war is not in the interests of the Argentine or the British peoples, or of the
Falkland Islanders. If British capitalism succeeds, then the irony of the situation is
that Argentina, which might ultimately have succeeded through negotiations in gaining some
sort of finger in the pie of the riches in the Falklands region, will obtain nothing. If
British capitalism succeeds, they will turn a deaf ear to Argentine aims, but the social
contradictions in Argentina unbalanced the regime and pushed the generals into action.</p>


<p>We must demand a general election now, as a way of bringing down the Tories and
returning the Labour Party to power with a socialist programme. The capitalist government
has landed us in a mess at home and abroad. This involves advancing our general programme:
for the nationalisation of the 200 monopolies with compensation on the basis of proven
need; for workers' control and management of industry, and for a socialist plan of
production. If necessary, British workers and the Marxists will be willing to wage a war
against the Argentine Junta, to help the Argentine workers to take power into their own
hands. But only a democratic socialist Britain would have clean hands. A Labour government
committed to socialist policies would probably not need to wage war, but could issue a
socialist appeal to the Argentine workers to overthrow the monstrous Junta, take power,
and then organise a socialist federation of Britain and the Argentine, in conjunction with
the Falkland Islands. The fears of the Falkland Islanders could be laid to rest by a
socialist Argentine, which would give them full autonomy with democratic control in the
hands of the Falkland workers themselves.</p>


<p>An approach on these lines, demanding a general election and the return of a Labour
government committed to socialist policies, would raise in the minds of the working class
all the issues of for who and for what the war is being waged. The irony is that finance
capital did not want the war, but through their Tory representatives have blundered into a
conflict which will have incalculable consequences for Latin America and Britain.</p>


<p>The strategists of British capital console themselves that Argentina is not El Salvador
or Nicaragua, in that it has a powerful capitalist industry, and a powerful agricultural
capitalist class. They calculate that even if they defeat Argentina and - with many
regrets - dispense with the present regime, the military rulers will be replaced, at any
rate in the first stage, by the Peronists, and the Peronist trade union leaders. The
Peronist trade union leaders have timidly put forward the demand for the expropriation of
foreign capital, but it will get short shrift from the Junta. But when the Junta is
over-thrown, the demand for the expropriation of foreign capital might get serious
support. However, the strategists of British capital know that there is no Marxist party,
or Marxist tendency, in Argentina.</p>


<p>After an interregnum - and this would be inevitable if the workers did not take power
in Argentina - there would be a new military dictatorship 'to end the chaos', a
totalitarian regime that would probably be even worse than the present one.</p>


<p>The war in the South Atlantic and its repercussions are a result of the accumulation of
contradictions during the course of the last few decades. The analysis which we made of
the crisis in British capitalism, and of developments in the Tory Party, has been shown to
be correct. Thatcher and the Tories are desperate. Without a victory on this issue they
are doomed. The splits between the 'Wets' and the hardline 'Dries' is reflected in the
splits behind the scenes on this issue. If no action had been taken, the Tory Party would
have been split in three ways. This mirrors the social contradictions in Britain, and the
splits in the Tories are an indication, as is the war, of the irreconcilable
contradictions between the classes in society. We are now in a new epoch, nationally and
internationally, an epoch of sharp turns and sudden changes. The social contradictions
within Britain and Argentina are even greater than the national contradictions between
them. Little things illuminate class contradictions. The British officers in the
expedition to South Georgia were willing to risk the lives of the men, who were no doubt
told that they were fighting against the fascists. But while the officers would not invite
the soldiers or sailors to dine with them, they invited the officers of the defeated Junta
forces.</p>


<p>This is only the beginning of a chain of upheavals in all countries in the coming
period.</p>


<p>It is noticeable that Thatcher abandoned her snarling at the Labour leaders and cooed
at Michael Foot on the television. Without the support of the trade union and labour
leaders it would be impossible to go to war, at least for any length of time. But if
things get really serious and Britain risked defeat, then the capitalists would demand a
coalition with the Labour leaders, and the right wing leaders would join, under a new
leader of the Tory Party and coalition premier. The Tories have embarked upon this
adventure because there is no other way to defend their power and prestige, and to assure
British big business of a decisive say in exploiting the resources in the Falklands and
Antarctica. They are staking their future on a decisive victory.</p>


<p>The Junta miscalculated completely, aided by the miscalculations of the British Foreign
Office. But the social contradictions have propelled them into war, and they have no other
way out. The bloody equation of war is incalculable. While it is almost certain that there
will be a victory for British imperialism, it is not absolutely certain that this will be
so. The defeat of the Junta would have enormous consequences and would promote revolution
in Argentina. A defeat for Britain would have enormous social consequences here, too, and
would mean the collapse of the Tory Party.</p>


<p>Whatever the outcome, the Marxists, with a correct approach towards the war and the
feelings of the workers in Britain, will gain. A correct orientation towards the working
people in Argentina is also of decisive importance. The sectarians will remain stewing in
their fantastic mish-mash of absurd slogans and spurious explanations, and will gain
nothing, except perhaps a few odd-balls. A Marxist approach towards the war could result
in a great increase of support for the genuine forces of Marxism. We are the only section
of the labour movement which has a clear understanding, first of war in general and the
war over the Falklands in particular, and, second, of how to approach the working class
and other exploited strata and win them to Marxism in the event of war.</p>
