<em>&ldquo;The finance ministers and
central bankers of the world are not able to control their own system&rdquo;</em></p
<p class="fst">
Heavy new
taxes in Britain, panic on the stock-exchange, the meeting of the Chancellors
of the ten top capitalist nations, demands that Germany revalue and France
devalue. The headlines in the press seem mysterious and remote, but they have a
devastating effect on the lives of the working class of these countries and of
the entire capitalist world.
</p>
<p>
It is
necessary for the most class-conscious workers and the active members of the
labour and trade union movement to have some understanding of what has taken
place, so that they can explain it to their fellows in the movement, and in
their factories and workplaces generally.
</p>
<p>
The
currency of a country is paper notes, issued by the government, which has to
have the backing of a certain amount of gold and the production of
commodities&mdash;goods&mdash;to cover these notes. These notes are mere promissory notes,
and of infinitesimal value in themselves. The writing on the British banknotes
make this clear&mdash;&ldquo;I promise to pay the bearer the sum of&hellip;&rdquo;&mdash;which has long been a
fiction.
</p>
<p>
Pre-war,
all currencies in capitalist countries were directly or indirectly linked to
gold. After the Second World War, with the defeat of the major capitalist
powers, except for America and Britain, the &ldquo;Anglo-Saxons&rdquo; were enabled to
impose what was known as the &ldquo;gold exchange standard&rdquo;. The medium of world
trade was no longer to be gold, but the dollar and the pound currencies. All
currencies were to be linked to the dollar, which alone had a direct link with
gold, at $35 to an ounce of gold.
</p>
<p>
The
American imperialists could impose this system because of the enormous
economic, military and financial power in comparison with their broken rivals&mdash;who
were dependent on American bounty to restore their shattered economies. The
last two decades have seen a big change in the economic and power
relationships. America, as the policeman of the world, has wasted enormous sums
and transformed a colossal favourable balance of payments into an enormous
deficit by expenditure on war and armaments. (The weakness that this has
engendered has forced them to the peace negotiations in Vietnam). The currency
is a reflection of the economic relationships nationally and internationally.
</p>
<p>
Every
capitalist country is dependent on the world market, and one of the main
factors in the post-war growth of western capitalism has been the growth of
interdependence, division of labour, and world trade. But at the same time the
economic contradictions between the capitalist countries have been piling up.
This in its turn is reflected in currency crisis and economic crisis in the
different countries. One of the capitalist economists, Pierre Uri, shows how
this process develops (in <i>The Times </i>of
November 25<sup>th</sup>). He says:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;The
most obvious lesson to draw from the present crisis is the intrinsic
contradiction between the otherwise desirable freedom of rates and movements of
capital, and the uncoordinated national, economic and monetary policies.
Disequilibrium is inevitable as long as individual countries claim autonomy,
when trends between one country and another slip out of line or when interest
rates are manipulated without consultation, movements of capital amplify the
degree of imbalance and it&rsquo;s hard to control those. Speculation is always the
whipping-boy; in most cases it is the natural effort to make a profit or avoid
a loss; this is the rule of the market place. Thus speculation is usually a
consequence and not a cause&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
What a nice
way to describe an insane system, where there is a colossal scramble for the
loot, and an unedifying swindle and a frantic grasping at the attempt to make
wealth. It is &ldquo;natural&rdquo; to a capitalist economy, to the world of the
stock-exchange sharks and currency speculators. Here it should be remembered
what the scramble is about is the <i>wealth
extracted from the surplus labour of the world&rsquo;s workers</i>. When Britain
devalued it meant a cut in real wages for the workers and without any effort a
nice nest-egg of &pound;250 million profit for the big combines in Britain. We know
there has been a swindle in government subsidies and loans in Britain. The
French capitalists have gone one better. Paris correspondent of the <i>Observer</i>, not noted for its
revolutionary fervour, points out that:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;&hellip;there was money to burn. More 2 percent export
credits were granted (by the French government) in the past few months than in
the whole of 1967.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Much
of this money, intended to buy new plant and mop up unemployment, ended up in
Swiss and German banks across the frontier&mdash;a scandal which must weigh heavily
on the conscience of French industry.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
These
irrationalities are the madness of the capitalist system. Your capitalist is
not interested in pounds, marks or dollar notes; he is only interested in one
sacred thing: profit. World trade is dominated by the half-dozen big powers&mdash;the
US, UK, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, and financially, Switzerland. But the
relations between these powers, economic and financial, are constantly in a state
of flux. Yesterday Germany was battered and broken, and today &ldquo;an incredible
situation, where Germany alone, through its surplus, counterbalances the
deficit of all other countries&rdquo; (Pierre Uri).
</p>
<p>
The
fluctuations in the balance of trade cause these crises in the different
capitalist countries because the purpose of capitalism and of world trade is <i>not</i> in fact the production and exchange
of goods, but the production of profits. Thus from a simple point of view the
irrational desire to have a surplus in the balance of payments and therefore
the <i>cutting down</i> of production, as in
Britain and France now, cutting down the standards of living of the working
class in order to increase profits. An observer from Mars would say that this
was mad, but it is merely the irrationality of the capitalist system&mdash;a system
which has long outlived itself.
</p>
<p>
Under
capitalism it is the market which dominates, and the world market which is
dominant above all. But under a market system commodities must be produced for
sale and there must be one commodity through which all other commodities
measure their value. That commodity is money. And the money commodity in modern
times has been gold. It can only be replaced by a similar commodity. All talk
of de-monetising gold is sheer balderdash. From a strictly &ldquo;logical&rdquo; point of
view it seems absurd that this yellow metal dug from the ground and then
carefully put into vaults with armed guards, should play the role in the
economy which it does. But that is the insane rationale of capitalism: of a
market economy.
</p>
<p>
In the last
two decades the dollar and the pound have been undermined by the enormous
expenditure on arms, expenditure which is completely barren, and produces only
what Marx has called fictitious capital&mdash;i.e. no real wealth. However, despite
the apparent strength of Germany, her economy still produces only one tenth
that of the US. The inflation and swindling and the jockeying for position in
the currency markets are a reflection of the processes of capitalist
production. The <i>Sunday Times </i>economic
humourist says seriously enough&mdash;&ldquo;ironically, if you know that world-wide
inflation is the order of things, you should know that it will proceed at
different rates in different counties, and that this will compel periodical
exchange adjustments&rdquo;. These adjustments can only take place through the
upheaval that we have seen in the recent period. This in a period of
unprecedented prosperity. At such times it is usually possible to arrive at
some sort of compromise, with the strongest jackal powers of course getting the
biggest share. But the contradiction of the capitalist system is that while
fighting each other for markets&mdash;and especially in view of their interdependence
in the post-war period&mdash;their fates are bound together like criminals on a chain-gang.
</p>
<p>
The
financial crisis casts a shadow over the crazy pattern of capitalist
production. This crisis will no doubt be patched up&mdash;but will only prepare the
way for the future crisis, looming ahead, of overproduction. This arises
inevitably at a certain stage in capitalist production, because of the limits
of the market, limits of investment, in comparison with the enormous productive
powers created by the working class. Capitalism has done its job in creating
the world market, but it is incapable of planning or controlling the world
production of wealth. It can only stagger on through monetary, financial,
political and economic upheavals. It is the working class which is affected in
all these countries. Capital knows no boundaries. Only a rational organisation
of production by dispossessing the capitalists and instituting a democratic
plan of production nationally and internationally, can put an end to the
instability and chronic disease of capitalism. While hundreds of millions
starve, and even the &ldquo;comfortably off&rdquo; workers in the main centres of
capitalist production face insecurity and anxiety, the world is overbrimming
with potential wealth. It is left to a socialist society to make use of this
potential.
