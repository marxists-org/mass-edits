<p class="fst">The election results in France 
provide a devastating criticism of the policy of the Communist and Socialist 
parties during what the capitalist press has termed the 'May Revolution'. 
Lenin spoke and wrote of decades of development leading to a revolutionary 
crisis during which the fate of the people could be decided during a 
few days. Such was the crisis in
May. <em>The Times </em>wrote that during that period &quot;All the physical 
levers of power were in the hands of the Communist Party.&quot; A general 
strike by its very nature poses the problem of power. This general strike 
began spontaneously, involving ever greater layers of the exploited, 
not only the industrial workers but the white collar workers as well. 
Peasants were affected and the police at that stage could not be relied 
upon. The army, according to reports, was also affected. Power could 
have been taken peacefully and a workers' democracy established. But 
the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, which had not initiated 
the movement but were as terrified as the government, stood in the way. 
The capitalist press greeted the role of the Communist Party with relief. <em>
The Economist </em>of 22 June commented: </p>

<p class="quote">&quot;They (the CP) acted like 
Fabians not like revolutionaries. And ever since, they have emphasised 
that their party is one of law and order. They kept silent when the 
police occupied the Sorbonne. They dissociated themselves publicly from 
'rabble-rousers and ultra-left provocateurs' and acquiesced in the government's 
decision to ban all the small left-wing revolutionary movements.&quot;</p>

<p class="fst">'The middle class must not 
be frightened!' Thus in the election campaign, instead of boldly proclaiming 
the need for a change in society and campaigning against the banks, 
monopolies and trusts - while also agitating for the demands of the 
peasants, the small businessmen, the shopkeepers and showing them that 
their interests were linked with those of the working class and against 
monopoly capital-they tried to vie with the Gaullists as the Party, 
as Waldeck Rochet had declared, &quot;the party of law and order&quot;. 
Their election posters even proclaimed: &quot;Against disorders and 
against anarchy - Vote Communist.&quot; This 'leader' even shamelessly 
declared that the CP had displayed a sense of responsibility in the 
crisis and only wanted a coalition government.</p>

<p>On this plane they could not 
hope to compete with the Gaullists - as de Gaulle cynically remarked, 
&quot;the party of the funk vote&quot;. The Gaullists raised the specter 
of a Stalinist France with a totalitarian regime, in which all the liberties 
of the people would be snuffed out as in the countries of Eastern Europe 
and China. Thus the middle class were stampeded, and even some sections 
of the working class were affected. </p>


<h4>June '68 election results</h4>

<p>The Gaullists obtained 9,663,605 
votes in comparison with 8,448,982 votes in 1967. Their Independent 
allies got 917,539 compared with 821,097 votes. The Communist Party 
received 4,435,357 this time in comparison with 5,039,032 last time. <b>
This represents a loss of 604,675 votes. </b>
The so-called Left Federation, composed principally of the Socialist 
Party, retained 3,654,003 in comparison with 4,224,110 in 1967, a loss 
of 570,107 votes. The PSU, Socialist Unity Party, <b>which stood to 
the left of the Communist Party succeeded in increasing 
its vote to 874,212 in comparison with 495,412, </b>
a gain of 378,800 votes. The capitalist Centre Democrats had 2,290,165 
in comparison with 2,839,998, a loss of 539,833 votes.</p>

<p>The <em>Morning Star </em>
and the French Communist Party find consolation in the fact that they 
&quot;only&quot; lost 600,000 votes out of the million gained at the 
last election (<em>Morning Star</em>, 25 June 1968). But they forget to add that in the early post-war period, 
with a smaller electorate the vote for the Communist Party and the Socialists 
was higher. In the first post-war elections, together they obtained 
51 per cent of the votes, higher then the Labour government of 1945 
which received 48 per cent of the vote. In conditions such as these, 
with clear and honest slogans, with an explanation to the people of 
the crisis facing French capitalism, of the inevitable ruination of 
the middle class and small businessmen, their vote would have been much 
higher. Had they acted with the revolutionary tide, power on a socialist 
programme would have won the overwhelming majority of the French people. 
It would have altered the whole balance of forces between the capitalists 
and workers throughout Western Europe, and even the world.</p>

<p>The cowardly leaders betrayed 
the working class and the French people. De Gaulle put forward a muddled 
demagogy &quot;against capitalism and totalitarian Communism.&quot; 
The Gaullists promised &quot;participation&quot; (whatever that is supposed 
to mean) to the workers and &quot;reforms of education and the state.&quot; 
It was on this basis that the middle class and large sections of the 
peasantry were panicked into voting for &quot;order&quot;. The policy 
of the workers' parties was a classic one of &quot;How not to win the 
middle class.&quot;</p>

<p>What now? Every serious capitalist, 
commentator regards the situation in France with dread. The workers, 
against the wishes of their &quot;leaders&quot;, have demonstrated and 
realised their own power in the spontaneous strike struggles. The French 
working class have a great revolutionary tradition. They have made important 
gains in wages and conditions. But these will be filched away by rising 
prices, by inflation, increases in the cost of living and the provocations 
of the capitalists.</p>


<p>The consequence will be a new 
outburst of anger during the autumn and winter. <em>The Economist, </em>
not given to making the flesh of its capitalist backers creep, declares: </p>

<p class="quote">&quot;Election results provide a more or less accurate picture of political 
preferences in a country at a given moment. This time the picture will 
be more than usually distorted because France has not recovered its 
composure. The question is how far the voters will be swayed by fear 
when they go to the polls on Sunday, and when they return there on 30 
June to complete the job. Or rather to complete the election. For the 
election <b>is not the end of the affair.&quot;</b></p>

<p class="fst">Big business has financed &quot;Gaullist 
commandos&quot; as the shock troops o French reaction. The day after 
the election a railwayman was killed in Paris fascist thugs after an 
argument. The workers on two stations declared a 24 hour strike. But 
this is a symptom what is to come. Finance capital w taken by surprise 
by the May movement of students and workers, but it is already beginning 
to prepare fort future. Reaction polarised itself round the Gaullists, 
but as even the American <em>Newsweek </em>
magazine quoted:</p>

<p class="quote"> &quot;By voting for de Gaulle, said one opposition 
politician, 'Frenchmen will assure themselves of the status quo for 
a few months or perhaps a few years. But will all end with a big bang 
compared to which last month's events ma seem like a carnival.&quot;' <br>

<h4>Learn from events</h4>

<p>There will be a falling away 
in the support for Gaullism among the peasants and middle class, since 
only big business will benefit from the policies. Gaullism will probably 
give way to the &quot;coalition of the Left&quot; so longingly demanded 
by the Communist Party. Thus the capitalists will prepare for a struggle 
with the workers. The victory of Gaullism will be a pyrrhic one. But 
the most advanced workers and students, particularly the youth, will 
be learning from these great events. The Communist Party leadership 
and that of the Socialists will demonstrate their responsibility for 
the harsh and bitter struggles that will face the workers. The Communist 
Part leadership will demonstrate that their own cowardice, stupidity 
and betrayal have solved nothing for the working class. The best elements 
of the rank and file will revolt. No longer is there the same blind 
support for the &quot;Communist&quot; Party which led to the defeat 
of the working class in the pre-war Popular Front and 1944-47. The struggle 
has just begun. In the coming months and years the working class will 
begin to see that the only solution to their problems lays in a change 
in society.</p>

<p>The leadership of the Communist 
Party, backed by the Russian bureaucracy, will find that the end will 
come for their policy of deceit and cynicism. No one can break the will 
of the working class to organise a new socialist order. At the cost 
of terrible and unnecessary sacrifices, the workers in France will continue 
the struggle begun with the May events. The socialist revolution in 
France has begun. Their leaders have halted them. But the workers will 
thrust them aside and find new leaders in the course of the mighty events 
which are coming</p>
