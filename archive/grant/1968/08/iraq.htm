The turmoil
and upheaval in the Middle East is indicated by the new coup in Iraq. The
revolution of 1958 overthrew the puppet Monarchy, a tool of British
imperialism. Since then Iraq has had military-police dictatorships hovering
between the threat of revolution and counter-revolution. The landlords have
continued to exploit the peasants despite the often repeated promises of land
reform which have not been carried out. Oil, and Iraq is rich in oil, has
dominated the politics of the country, as it is one of the main questions for
the area. The corrupt landlord-capitalist regime, has been unable to solve any
of the problems facing the peoples of Iraq. The Kurdish people have failed to
gain their autonomy and national rights despite the pledges of the rulers in
Baghdad.
</p>
<p>
The craven
capitulation of the Communist Party after the July 1958 revolution led to the
victory of counterrevolution by means of a seizure of power by the generals.
The right wing Baath Socialist Party leaders helped in this process, crushing
and banning the Communist Party, with the brunt of the terror being borne by
the unfortunate rank and file. The Baath socialists in their turn were ousted
by the very man, General Aref, whom they had raised to power.
</p>
<p>
The
accumulation of the misery of the people, the stagnation and corruption of the
rule of the generals, the ferment provoked by the defeat of the Arab armies in
the Israeli war had its effect. The revolution in Syria, carried through by
left wing Baathists with the support of the Syrian workers and peasants, has
also had its repercussions, even if delayed.
</p>
<p>
According
to the reports it is the right wing of the Baath Socialist Party, or rather
their supporters among the young army officers, who have organised this new
seizure of power to &ldquo;restore&rdquo; the situation as it existed in 1963. In 1963 the
Baath organised the coup which ousted and murdered General Kassem only to
prepare the seizure of power by their &ldquo;nominee&rdquo; President Aref. After his death
his brother succeeded to power with the generals, a right-wing military clique.
Now they have been overthrown.
</p>
<p>
It will be
impossible to put the clock back to 1963. The rule of the Baath lasted only 9
months, till President Aref organised his own grab for power. Now the new
president is Ahmed Hassan Bakr, who was the Baath Prime Minister during their 9
months&rsquo; rule in 1963. However, the right wing Baathist will not be able to
maintain power for a long period. No more than in 1963 do they have a solution
to the problems facing Iraq today. Either they will move to the left, be
replaced by a more left wing government akin to that of Syria or they will
prepare the way for a new right wing take-over.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
they will try and divert the attention of the Iraqi people from their problems
by using the Israeli question, the problem of the regime in Jordan and
possibly, as the imperialists would wish, aiding conspiracies against the left
wing Baathist government in Syria. It is just as likely that the Syrian
Bonapartist workers&rsquo; state can have an effect on the Baghdad regime. This in
turn will have repercussions in Jordan, Egypt and the semi-feudal sheikhdoms in
Saudi Arabia. The British imperialist dominated Kuwait regime has been the
first Arab country to recognise the new government.
</p>
<p>
However,
the calculations of the Imperialists may be falsified by events. The
instability of the Middle East during the last decade means that the fall of
one government provokes repercussions among the others. Iraqi landlordism and
capitalism have not been stabilised. The workers and peasants have still the
possibility of putting their imprint on events, as eventually they must.
