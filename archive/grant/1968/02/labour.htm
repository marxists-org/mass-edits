Devaluation
meant an attack on the standard of living. It has been followed by the &ldquo;cuts&rdquo;
in government expenditure which will fall most heavily, as far as domestic
expenditure is concerned, on the poorest sections of the population. The real
cause of the crises in the British economy have been the policies of the ruling
class over the last decades and the attempt to maintain their world imperialist
domination.
</p>
<p>
Since the
Second World War they attempted to compete with the super-powers of America and
Russia in the field of armaments, and wasted the substance of the people in
this futile endeavour. <i>Apart from Russia
and America they spent a greater part of the national income on &ldquo;defence&rdquo; than
any other power</i>: 10 percent of the national income in the immediate
post-war period and 6 to 7 percent during the last 10 years. This has been one
of the causes of the balance of payments crises.
</p>
<p>
Before
coming to power, Harold Wilson announced a continuation of the Conservative
policies of maintaining a role for British capitalism &ldquo;East of Suez.&rdquo; But
British capitalism had not the strength to carry out this policy. In the period
between the wars, the armed forces in this and other colonial areas were paid
for by taxes on the colonial peoples themselves. With the national awakening
and nominal &ldquo;independence&rdquo; of India, Malaysia and Singapore&mdash;the brunt of the
cost was borne by the British.
</p>
<p>
Arms which,
due to the speeding up of the technique of mass slaughter, become obsolete as
soon as&mdash;or even before&mdash;they are on the production line, become ever more
costly. This is one of the main causes of the crises. <i>Up to &pound;40,000 million has gone down the drain in this way</i>. Even
now, the &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; are only cuts of future expenditure. Britain will still spend
more on the armed forces than any major power, apart from the two super-powers.
But the policy of maintaining armed forces in the Persian Gulf and Singapore
has been abandoned. &pound;300 million a year will thus be &ldquo;saved&rdquo; by 1971. But the
drain on the economy will still be continued.
</p>
<p>
<i>Since the election of the Labour government, the
Confederation of British Industry, the bankers and the capitalist press have
been demanding &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; in &ldquo;wasteful&rdquo; government expenditure</i>. Though
Britain spends less than the other major powers on the social services,
including the citadel of capitalism: the United States. It is <i>these</i> that have been a major target.
These &ldquo;sacred cows&rdquo; of the labour movement, as they were sneeringly referred
to, must be sliced, if &ldquo;confidence&rdquo; nationally and internationally in the
devalued pound and the British economy were to be restored.
</p>
<p>
Having
landed the labour movement in the mud, by carrying on policies dictated by
these same circles, and <i>with the balance
of payments in deficit by &pound;525 million in 1967, the programme of reforms, on
which the Labour government was elected, has been largely abandoned</i>. Family
allowances will go up in April by 7/-, but the full amount will be recovered in
taxes on the standard rate of income tax. The school-leaving age which was to
be raised to 16 in 1971, will now be deferred to 1973. Free milk in secondary
schools will no longer be provided, as from September. Some new university
buildings, and colleges of further education will not be built during the year
1968-69.
</p>
<p>
From
September, students grants will only be raised to cover half the increased cost
of living. &pound;39 million will be &ldquo;saved&rdquo; in 1968-69 and &pound;58 million in the
following year. On the health service, prescription charges are to be
reintroduced <i>at higher rates than before</i>
of 2s 6d per item. With exemptions for the chronically sick, old age
pensioners, expectant mothers &ldquo;only&rdquo; &pound;25 million will be saved. The other &pound;25
million will be made up by <i>increasing
National Health Service employees&rsquo; contribution by 6d</i>. The maximum charge
for dental treatment will be increased &pound;1 to 30s in order to save &pound;1,500,000.
Local health and welfare expenditure will be cut by an average of &pound;5 million. A
further 6d will be levied on employees and employers on National Insurance.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Civil
defence&rdquo; which is a pretence in the era of the H Bomb, will be cut by &pound;14
million in 1968-69 and &pound;20 million in 1969-70. <i>House building is to be cut by 16,500 in 1968 and 1969</i>, &ldquo;saving&rdquo;
&pound;27 million in 1968-69 and &pound;69 million in 1969-70. <i>Expenditure on road building will be reduced by &pound;53 million in 1968-69
and &pound;69 million in 1969-70</i>. Investment payments will be reduced by &pound;80
million in 1968-69. By all the cuts &pound;325 million will be &ldquo;saved&rdquo; in 1968-69 and
&pound;441 million in 1969-70.
</p>
<p>
<i>Devaluation will mean rising prices and higher profits
for the capitalists</i>. At the same time attempts will be made to hold back
wage increases to compensate for the increased cost of living, as with the
provincial busmen.
</p>
<p>
At the same
time as the programme of building 500,000 houses by 1970 is abandoned and the
rents of council tenants increased. <i>While
the social services are cut, hundreds of millions of pounds will still be
handed out to big business</i>. To speed the amalgamation of yet another monopoly,
BMC and Leyland (joining together to make yet another staggeringly big
combine), <i>they will receive a loan of &pound;25
million from the government</i> as a blessing. The Westminster and National
Provincial banks are to be combined making for a big four, instead of a big
five banking monopolies.
</p>
<p>
While
vociferously demanding sacrifices from the people, and cuts in
&ldquo;consumption&rdquo;&mdash;i.e. the workers&rsquo; share of the wealth that they produce&mdash;the
Tories and the capitalist press, television and radio, clamour for &ldquo;incentives&rdquo;
for big business and the higher income groups in management. A small increase
in corporation tax is met with gnashing of teeth by the CBI. Suggestions of
state buying of shares <i>voluntarily</i>,
and of a <i>ridiculously token amount</i>,
are met by threats of refusal of &ldquo;co-operation&rdquo; by the CBI. <i>The cuts in the social service and
government expenditure are not deemed sufficient!</i>
</p>
<p>
Yet
nowhere has it been suggested that the &ldquo;sacred cow&rdquo; of the interest on the
national debt, incurred to pay for past and future wars, should be cut. This
alone amounted in the last financial year to over &pound;1,100 million! Twenty-six of
the left wingers supporting the <i>Tribune</i>
rebelled and abstained on the vote for the abandoning of Labour&rsquo;s election
programme. Howls of indignation from the right wing and from the capitalist
press greeted this decision. They know that the overwhelming majority of the
organised labour movement will support this stand. <i>Demand the restoration of the cuts and let the wealthy pay!</i>
</p>
<p>
However,
the lefts have reacted to the Cabinet&rsquo;s cuts much as Wilson reacted to the
measures of the Tories when they were in power. While capitalism continues in
existence the economy cannot function unless the capitalists are prepared to
invest, and they will not be prepared to do so unless they can squeeze further
surplus profits from the workers. This means allowing prices and profits to
rise while freezing wages. They want government expenditure cut because it
absorbs part of this surplus. <i>Thus these
cuts are necessary if private industry is to have the means of securing a
greater part of the wealth produced by the workers</i>.
</p>
<p>
Thus
it is a class question and not one of stupidity or weakness on the part of the
Cabinet. As nine tenths of the productive part of industry is privately owned and
the lion&rsquo;s share of the wealth of the country is owned by a handful, <i>they</i> call the tune.
</p>
<p>
The
&ldquo;lefts&rdquo; have no realistic alternative policy except those of selective imports
and controls of foreign exchange. But Britain economically is not an island but
part of the world economy and subject to the world market. <i>It is impossible to introduce import controls without reprisals</i> and
absolutely impossible to control foreign exchange, while the economy remains
capitalist. The capitalists would find thousands of loopholes and black-market
means of avoiding such restrictions. <i>It
would cause a terrible panic on the stock exchange, and a real crisis of
&ldquo;confidence&rdquo;, and lead to an even greater fall of investment, and thus of
production and employment</i>.
</p>
<p>
It is not a
question of &ldquo;plots&rdquo; by foreign or British bankers. <i>The measures would cause chaos unless accompanied by real measures to
change the society which is at the root of the problem</i>.
</p>
<p>
Right-wingers,
like Donnelly and Paget, were more interested in maintaining the position of
East of Suez. Demagogically Heath and the Conservatives made great play on this
question. Yet the serious journals of capitalist opinion have long been
demanding the facing of the realities of capitalist Britain&rsquo;s position in the
modern world and not the world of the nineteenth century, which Conservative
and Labour governments have vainly attempted to maintain unchanged.
</p>
<p>
Wilson,
whom the press and the capitalists praised and flattered as a &ldquo;real statesman&rdquo;
when he capitulated to Big Business and adopted Tory policies of maintaining
the pound, incomes policies, stop-go economics, has been made the scapegoat by
the capitalists. They have jumped on and rended the fallen idol, for carrying
out their policies, which have ended disastrously. They are preparing the way,
in the event of a future crisis, for panicking the people, splitting away the
Labour right wing in Parliament and forming a so-called &ldquo;national&rdquo; government,
i.e. a Tory capitalist coalition.
</p>
<p>
The whole
issue has been made one of the &ldquo;confidence&rdquo; of those who possess the wealth
nationally and internationally. As Stokes, the head of Leyland, openly
remarked: <i>&ldquo;We are not in business to make
cars, but to make money&rdquo;</i>. That can be said of all the capitalists.
Meanwhile the monopolies and combines which control Britain have been reduced
from 380 to closer to 300 monopolies: giant banks and insurance companies,
which control the wealth of the country.
</p>
<p>
But there
is a real question of confidence! The confidence of the organised labour
movement and of the working class in the programme of socialism. Taking over
the few hundred monopolies: with &ldquo;selective&rdquo; compensation on the basis of need:
instituting a monopoly of foreign trade on this basis, would solve the problems
of the economy. Producing for themselves and for the needs of the people, the
working class would set to with a will. Production and living standards would
leap forward. Instead of the &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; of the people being cut in the
interests of a tiny minority, the special &ldquo;interests&rdquo; of the minority would be
sacrificed for the benefit of the people. While supporting the left wing in
their partial programme at the present time, it is only these measures which
can save the working class from the recurrent crises of decaying British and
world capitalism.
