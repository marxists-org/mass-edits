<p class="quote">&ldquo;History knows  transformations of all sorts.&rdquo; (Lenin)</p>
<p>
The question of the class  nature of Russia has been a central issue in the Marxist movement for decades.  Now, with the collapse of the USSR and the movement in the direction of  capitalism, this question assumes an even greater importance. How we approach  this problem will be vital not only for training our cadres, but for our general  work in the labour movement, and, at a later stage, for the building of a  Marxist tendency in Russia.</p>
<p>
It is not possible to grasp  the processes that are taking place in Russia from the point of view of formal  logic and abstract definitions. Only the dialectical method, which takes the  process as a whole and concretely analyses its contradictory tendencies as  they unfold, stage by stage, can shed light on the situation. In elementary  chemistry, a simple litmus test is sufficient to reveal whether a substance is  acid or alkaline. But complex historical processes do not admit such a simple  approach.</p>
<p>
The demand for an immediate  answer to the question &ldquo;workers&rsquo; state or capitalism&rdquo; seems to have the virtue  of clear definition and even political firmness. Alas! In nature, as in  society, the attempt to impose a &ldquo;final solution&rdquo; when dealing with unfinished  processes is the source, not of clarity, but of endless confusion and mistakes.  When it is a question of transitional formations, demands for a black and white,  &ldquo;either or&rdquo; solution reveal, not intellectual rigour,  but only a formalistic frame of mind which, in its haste to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; a problem  by applying an external definition in a thoughtless fashion, does not deal with  the real processes at all.</p>
<p>
Nor are formal analogies  much use here. What is taking place in Russia has no real precedent in history  since the fall of the Roman empire. If the movement towards capitalism is  finally accomplished, it would signify the destruction of all the gains of the  October Revolution. This did not occur, for example, with the French  Revolution, where the gains of the Jacobean-plebeian movement were liquidated  by the Thermidorian reaction in 1794. Thereafter, the movement in the direction  of reaction went very far&#8212;from Thermidor to the Directorate,  Bonapartism, the restoration of the Empire and a new aristocracy, and even the  restoration of the Bourbon monarchy on English and Prussian bayonets after  1815. Yet through all these changes, the basic socio-economic gains of the  Revolution of 1789-93 remained intact. The fundamental question was the new  property relations raised on the foundation of the breaking up of the big  feudal estates and the establishment of a mass of small peasant proprietors.</p>
<p>
Likewise, the political counterrevolution  carried out by the Stalinist bureaucracy in Russia completely liquidated the  regime of workers&rsquo; soviet democracy, but did not destroy the new property  relations established by the October Revolution. The ruling bureaucracy based  itself on the nationalised, planned economy and played a relatively progressive  role in developing the productive forces, although at three times the cost of  capitalism, with tremendous waste, corruption and mismanagement, as Trotsky  pointed out even before the War when the economy was advancing at 20% a year. </p>
<p>
The problem which we now  face was also faced by Trotsky in the 1920s and 30s, when he had the task of  analysing the phenomenon of Stalinism. For certain ultra lefts, the problem was  a simple one. The Soviet Union, in their opinion, was already a new class  society as early as 1920. All further analysis was therefore superfluous! There  was a fundamental difference between this formalism and the careful dialectical  method of Trotsky. He painstakingly traced the process of the Stalinist  counterrevolution through all its stages, laying bare all its contradictions,  analysing the conflicting tendencies both within Soviet society and within the  bureaucracy itself, and showing the dialectical interrelation between developments  in the USSR and on a world scale.</p>
<p>
Here is how Trotsky  describes his own method of analysis:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;To define the Soviet  regime as a transitional, or intermediate, means to abandon such finished  social categories as capitalism (and therewith &lsquo;state capitalism&rsquo;) and also  socialism. But besides being completely inadequate in itself, such a definition  is capable of producing the mistaken idea that from the present Soviet regime  only a transition to socialism is possible. In reality a backslide to  capitalism is wholly possible. A more complete definition will of necessity be  complicated and ponderous.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The Soviet Union is a  contradictory society halfway between capitalism and socialism, in which: (a)  the productive forces are still far from adequate to give the state property a  socialist character; (b) the tendency toward primitive accumulation created by  want breaks out through innumerable pores of the planned economy; (c) norms of  distribution preserving a bourgeois character lie at the basis of a new differentiation  of society; (d) the economic growth, while slowly bettering the situation of  the toilers, promotes a swift formation of privileged strata; (e) exploiting  the social antagonisms, a bureaucracy has converted itself into an uncontrolled  caste alien to socialism; (f) the social revolution, betrayed by the ruling  party, still exists in property relations and in the consciousness of the  toiling masses; (g) a further development of the accumulating contradictions  can as well lead to socialism as back to capitalism; (h) on the road to  capitalism the counterrevolution would have to break the resistance of the  workers; on the road to socialism the workers would have to overthrow the  bureaucracy. In the last analysis, the question will be decided by a struggle  of living social forces, both on the national and the world arena.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Doctrinaires will  doubtless not be satisfied with this hypothetical definition. They would like  categorical formulae: yes&#8212;yes, and no&#8212;no. Sociological  problems would be certainly simpler, if social phenomena had always a finished  character. There is nothing more dangerous, however, than to throw out of  reality, for the sake of logical completeness, elements which today violate  your scheme and tomorrow may wholly overturn it. In our analysis, we above all  avoided doing violence to dynamical social formations which have no precedent  and have no analogies. The scientific task, as well as the political, is not to  give a finished definition to an unfinished process, but to follow all its  stages, separate its progressive from its reactionary tendencies, expose their  mutual relations, foresee possible variants of development, and find in this  foresight a basis for action.&rdquo; (Leon Trotsky, <em>The Revolution Betrayed</em>, pp.  254-56.)</p>
<p>
The problem of the class  nature of the Soviet Union occupied Trotsky&rsquo;s attention right up to his death.  In In Defence of Marxism, he outlines the way in which a Marxist would pose the  question of the class nature of the Russian state:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;(1) What is the historical  origin of the USSR? (2) What changes has this state suffered during its  existence? (3) Did these changes pass from the quantitative stage to the  qualitative? That is, did they create a historically necessary domination by a  new exploiting class?&rdquo; (p.68)</p>
<p>
Right to the end, he was  always extremely conditional on the question of the future evolution of the  USSR, while maintaining a principled position on the defence of the Soviet  Union in the War. He did not expect the Stalinist regime to last as long as it  did. True, in his last work Stalin, he did suggest that the regime might last  for decades in its present form, but the book was unfinished at the time of his  assassination, and he was unable to develop this idea further.</p>
<p>
It was left to the Marxists  to develop and extend Trotsky&rsquo;s analysis of proletarian Bonapartism after the  War, particularly in Ted Grant&rsquo;s The Marxist Theory of the State, the Reply to  David James, and later on, the documents on the Colonial Revolution. What  defines the class nature of the state from a Marxist point of view is  undoubtedly property relations. However, here too, the relation is not  automatic, but dialectical. The state is not the direct expression of the  ruling class&#8212;whether it is the bourgeoisie or the working class.  Under certain conditions, the ruling clique can manoeuvre between the classes  and eliminate the existing property relations. This was the case with the army  caste in Syria, Burma, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, as only our tendency was able to  explain. Now in Russia and Eastern Europe we have a peculiar variant of the  same process, but in reverse.</p>
<p>
This unusual variant of  Bonapartism can only be explained by the fact that the state has raised itself  above society. Trotsky predicted that the bureaucracy, particularly its upper  layers, would inevitably seek to guarantee its power and privileges by  transforming itself into a ruling class. Within a particular historical  concatenation of circumstances, the pro-bourgeois wing of the bureaucracy has,  for the time being, gained the upper hand. Leaning on world imperialism and the  nascent bourgeoisie&#8212;the millions of crooks, spivs, and black  marketeers, who already existed in the pores of Soviet society&#8212;they  have already gone a long way in this direction, without provoking a civil war.  This is a peculiar mechanism for the carrying out of the counterrevolution. But  it is no more peculiar than the &ldquo;workers&#8217; state&rdquo; from which it arose, or the  peculiar way in which the regimes of proletarian Bonapartism established  themselves in Eastern Europe, Syria or Ethiopia.</p>
<p>
Up to the present time, the  bourgeois wing of the bureaucracy has partially succeeded in carrying out the  counterrevolution in a &ldquo;cold&rdquo; way. Partially, but not entirely. The process is  not complete. On the basis of the frightful economic and social collapse, not  only the working class, but a section of the bureaucracy is beginning to swing  the other way. It is possible that this process could lead eventually to civil  war. This perspective partly depends on which way the officer caste will jump.  It is quite likely that the decisive section of the officers will move in the  direction of proletarian Bonapartism which, after all, guaranteed their  privileges much better that the present regime.</p>
<p>
In Eastern Europe, the old  regime collapsed without a whimper. In the same way, under certain conditions,  it is possible that the bourgeois regime could collapse when confronted with a  massive movement of the working class which draws behind it a big section of  the petit-bourgeoisie. History indeed knows all kinds of transformations! Of  course, we have the classical models of revolution and counterrevolution which  are familiar to every schoolboy who has read a bit of Lenin. But there are  many other variants known to history. In the 19th century, the transition from  feudalism to capitalism in Japan was accomplished through the mechanism of the  bureaucracy, which, under a peculiar set of circumstances, shifted from one  class basis to another without a revolution or civil war. Of course, the  transition to capitalism was not a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; one&#8212;there were many elements of feudalism in it, which were only eliminated (in another peculiar  variant) by the US occupying forces after 1945, under the pressure of the  Chinese revolution. All these events further illustrate the enormous complexity  of the question of the state.</p>
<p>
When considering the  development of society, economics must be considered the dominant factor. The  superstructure which develops on this economic base separates itself from the  base and becomes antagonistic to it. The essence of the Marxist theory of  revolution is that with the gradual changes in production under the embryo of  the old form, i.e. superstructure and re-organising society on the base of the  new mode of production which has developed within the old. Economy is  ultimately decisive. Because of this, as all the Marxist teachers were at pains  to explain, in the long run the superstructure must come into correspondence  with it. Once we abandon the criterion of the basic economic structure of  society, all sorts of superficial and arbitrary constructions are possible.  However, the bare affirmation that, in the last analysis, the class nature of  the state is decided by property relations is insufficient.</p>
<p>
The state can be defined in  various ways. One of the most common ways for Marxists to do so is by referring  to the state as &ldquo;armed bodies of men in defence of private property.&rdquo; In the  last analysis, all forms of state are reduced to this. But in practice, the  state is much more than the army and the police. The modern state, even under  capitalism, is a bureaucratic monster, an army of functionaries absorbing a  huge amount of the surplus value produced by the working class. From that point  of view, there is a germ of truth in the arguments of the monetarists, whose  demand for cutting down the state is a modern echo of the demand of the 19th  century Liberals for &ldquo;cheap government.&rdquo; Of course, as Marx explains in The  Civil War in France, the only way to get &ldquo;cheap government&rdquo; is by the  revolutionary abolition of the bourgeois state, and the setting up of a workers&rsquo;  state, or semi-state, like the Paris Commune.</p>
<h4>The Marxist theory of  the State</h4>
<p>
Marx, Engels and Lenin all  explained that the state is a special power, standing above society and increasingly alienating itself from it. As a general proposition, we can accept  that every state reflects the interest of a particular ruling class. But this  observation does not at all exhaust the question of the specific role of the  state in society. In reality, the state bureaucracy has its own interests,  which do not necessarily and at all times correspond to those of the ruling  class, and may even come into open collision with the latter.</p>
<p>
According to Marxists, the  state arises as the necessary instrument for the oppression of one class by  another class. The state in the last analysis, as explained by Marx and Lenin,  consists of armed bodies of men and their appendages. That is the essence of  the Marxist definition. However, one must be careful in using their broad  Marxist generalisations, which are undoubtedly correct, in an absolute sense.  Truth is always concrete but if one does not analyse the particular  ramifications and concrete circumstances, one must inevitably fall into  abstractions and errors. Look at the cautious way in which Engels deals with  the question, even when generalising. In <em>The Origins of the Family, Private  Property and the State</em>, Engels writes:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;But in order that these  antagonisms, classes with conflicting economic interests, shall not consume  themselves and society in fruitless struggle, a power, apparently standing  above society, has become necessary to moderate the conflict and keep it within  the bounds of &lsquo;order,&rsquo; and this power, arisen out of society, but placing  itself above it and increasingly alienating itself from it, is the State.&rdquo;  (<em>The Origins of the Famil</em>y, p. 194.)</p>
<p>
On the next page he adds:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;&hellip;it  is enough to look at Europe today, where class struggle and rivalry in conquest  have brought the public power to a pitch where it threatens to devour the whole  of society and even the state itself.&rdquo; </p>
<p>
Engels goes on to show that  once having arisen, the state within certain limits, develops an independent  movement of its own and must necessarily do so under given conditions: &ldquo;In  possession of the public power and the right of taxation, the officials now  present themselves as organs of society standing above society.&rdquo; (Emphasis in  original.)</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;As the state arose from  the need to keep class antagonisms in check, but also arose in the thick of the  fight between the classes, it is normally the state of the most powerful,  economically ruling class, which by its means becomes also the political ruling  class, and so acquires new means of holding down and exploiting the oppressed  class&hellip; Exceptional periods, however, occur when the  warring classes are so nearly equal in forces that the state power, as apparent  mediator, acquires for the moment a certain independence in relation to both&hellip;&rdquo;  (p.196, our emphasis.)</p>
<p>
Again, on page 201, Engels  says that:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The central link in  civilised society is the state, which in all typical periods (our emphasis) is  without exception the state of the ruling class, and in all cases con tinues to  be essentially a machine for holding down the oppressed, exploited class&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Note the extremely careful,  scientific way in which Engels expresses himself. &ldquo;In all typical periods,&rdquo; &ldquo;it  is normally the state of the most powerful, economically ruling class,&rdquo; etc.  Engels clearly understood that there were untypical and abnormal situations in  which this general principle of Marxist theory could not be applied. This  dialectical approach to the question of the state was developed by Marx in <em>The  18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</em>, where he explains the phenomenon of  Bonapartism, in which the relationship between the state and the ruling class  does not correspond to the norm. Marx pointed out how the drunken soldiery of  Louis Napoleon, in the name of &ldquo;the law, order and the family,&rdquo; shot down the bourgeoisie  whom they presumably represented. Were the bourgeoisie under Louis Napoleon the  ruling class? It does not require a profound knowledge of Marxism to answer  this question.</p>
<p>
The bare generalisation &ldquo;armed  bodies of men&rdquo; does not take into account either bourgeois or proletarian  Bonapartism. If we take the history of modern society, we get many examples  where the bourgeoisie is expropriated politically and yet remains the ruling  class. Trotsky describes the regime of Bonapartism, or as Marx calls it, &ldquo;naked  rule by the sword over society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
In China after Chiang Kai  Shek had crushed the Shanghai working class with the aid of the dregs of the  Shanghai gangs, the bankers wished to give him banquets and applauded him as  the benefactor and saviour of civilisation. But Chiang wanted something more  material than the praise of his masters. Unceremoniously, he clapped all the  rich industrialists and bankers of Shanghai in jail and extracted a ransom of  millions before he would release them. He had done the job for them and now  demanded the price. He had not crushed the Shanghai workers for the benefit of  the capitalists, but for what it meant in power and income for him and his gang  of thugs. Yet who will presume to say that the bankers who were in jail were not  still the ruling class though they did not hold political power? The Chinese  bourgeoisie must have reflected sadly on the complexity of a society where a  good portion of the loot in the surplus value extracted from the workers had to  go to their own watchdogs, and where many of their class were languishing in  jail.</p>
<p>
The bourgeoisie is  politically expropriated under such conditions; naked force dominates society.  An enormous part of the surplus value is consumed by the top militarists and  officials. But it is in the interests of these bureaucrats that the capitalist  exploitation of the workers should continue, and therefore while they squeeze  as much as they can out of the bourgeoisie, nevertheless, they defend private  property. That is why the bourgeoisie continues to be the ruling class.</p>
<p>
In <em>In Defence of Marxism</em>,  Trotsky outlines the difference between Bonapartism and fascism:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The element which fascism  has in common with the old Bonapartism is that it used the antagonisms of  classes in order to give to the state power the greatest independence. But we  have always underlined that the old Bonapartism was in a time of an ascending  bourgeois society, while fascism is a state power of the declining bourgeois  society.&rdquo; (p.227)</p>
<p>
A fascist regime, unlike  Bonapartism, comes to power on the backs of a mass movement composed of the enraged petit bourgeoisie and lumpenproletariat. Once in power, however, it  rapidly loses its mass base and becomes a Bonapartist regime, leaning on the  army and the police. Trotsky likens the Nazi bureaucracy in Germany to the &ldquo;Old  Man of the Sea&rdquo; who sits on the shoulders of the bourgeoisie, and, in return  for guiding it on the road to safety, at the same time abuses it, spitting on  its bald patch and digging his spurs in its sides. Of course, there is no doubt  that the class nature of the Nazi state was bourgeois. But, on the other hand,  the German bourgeoisie lost control of the state, which fell into the hands of  Hitler&rsquo;s irresponsible and criminal adventurers, who used it for their own  advantage. The Nazis, who defended capitalist property relations, not only  robbed the bourgeois and confiscated their property, but also occasionally  executed them.</p>
<p>
Here the relation between  the state and the ruling class is dialectical and contradictory. In fact, by  1943, the interests of the ruling class in Germany were in open conflict with  the state. By that time, Germany had already lost the War. It was in the  interests of the ruling class to arrive at a peace with Britain and America, in  order to wage war against the Soviet Union. But surrender would have been the  death sentence for the Nazi clique that controlled the state. The German  bourgeoisie tried, and failed, to remove Hitler by a military coup (the &ldquo;generals&rsquo;  plot&rdquo;). Hitler fought the war to the bitter end, and Germany paid the price  with the loss of its eastern half to Stalinist Russia.</p>
<h4>The transitional state  after October</h4>
<p>
The proletariat, according  to the classical con cept, smashes the old state machine and proceeds to create  a semi-state. Nevertheless, it is forced to utilise the old technicians. But  the state, even under the best conditions, say in an advanced country with an  educated pro letariat, remains a bourgeois instrument, and because of this the  possibility of degeneration is implicit in it. For that reason Marxists insist  on the control of the masses, to ensure that the state should not be allowed to  develop into an independent force. As speedily as possible, it should be  dissolved into society.</p>
<p>
It is for the very reasons  given above that, under certain conditions, the state gains a certain  independence from the base which it originally represented. Engels ex plained  that though the superstructure is dependent on the economic base, it  nevertheless has an in dependent movement of its own. For quite a lengthy  period, there can be a conflict between the state and the class which that  state represents. That is why Engels speaks of the state &ldquo;normally&rdquo; or in &ldquo;typical  periods&rdquo; directly representing the ruling class.</p>
<p>
It is impossible to pass  directly from capitalism to socialism. Even in an advanced society, a  transitional period would be necessary in which the state would continue to  exist for a time, along with money and the law of value. But, as Marx explains,  the working class would not require the kind of monstrous state that exists  under capitalism, but a very simple state, a workers&rsquo; state, which would begin  to disappear from the first day. Two months before the seizure of power, Lenin  wrote in <em>The State and Revolution</em>:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The proletariat needs a  state&#8212;this all the opportunists can tell you, but they, the  opportunists, for get to add that the proletariat needs only a dying  state&#8212;that is, a state constructed in such a way that it immediately  be gins to die away and cannot help dying away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The state cannot be  abolished, as the anarchists imagine, but will wither away as the need for  coercion disappears with the general increase of living standards and culture.  That, however, depends on society&rsquo;s ability to satisfy human wants. This, in  turn, depends on the level of economic development, and, above all, the  productivity of labour (&ldquo;economy of labour time&rdquo;).</p>
<p>
A transitional state  inevitably has a contradictory character. The Soviet regime was based on the  new property relations that issued from the October Revolution, but still had  many elements taken over from the old bourgeois society. The nationalisation of  the means of production is the prior condition for moving in the direction of  socialism, but the possibility of really carrying society onto a higher stage  of human development depends on the level of the productive forces. Socialism  presupposes a higher level of technique, labour produc tivity and culture than  even the most de veloped capitalist society. It is impossible to build  socialism on the basis of backwardness. As Marx expressed it: &ldquo;where misery is  general, all the old &lsquo;crap&rsquo; revives.&rdquo; By the old &lsquo;crap&rsquo; he meant bourgeois  norms of distribution, in equality, money, the bourgeois family and that relic  of barbarism, the state.</p>
<p>
In <em>The Revolution Betrayed</em>,  Trotsky explains the dual character of the transitional state:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The bourgeois norms of  distribution, by hastening the growth of material power, ought to serve  socialist aims&#8212;but only in the last analysis. The state as sumes  directly and from the very beginning a dual character: socialistic, insofar as  it defends social property in the means of production; bourgeois, insofar as  the distribution of life&rsquo;s goods is carried out with a capitalistic measure of  value and all the consequences ensuing there from. Such a contradictory  characterisation may horrify the dogmatists and scholastics; we can only offer  them our condolences.&rdquo; (p.54)</p>
<p>
Only the victory of the  revolution in Western Europe, particularly Germany, could have changed this  state of affairs. The union of German industry and technique with the huge  natural and human resources of Russia in a Socialist Federation would have  created the material conditions for the reduction of the working day, the prior  condition for the participation of the working class in the running of industry  and the state. But the betrayal of the Social democracy shipwrecked the German  revolution and doomed the Russian revolution to isolation in a backward  country. The victory of the bureaucracy flowed directly from this. As early as  1922, Lenin pointed out that, beneath the thin veneer of soviet democracy, &ldquo;if  you scratch a little, you will find the same old tsarist state which we have  taken over and anointed with soviet oil.&rdquo; From 1920 onwards, the bureaucracy  legally or illegally absorbed part of the surplus value produced by the working  class.</p>
<p>
This would be the case to  some extent even in a healthy workers&rsquo; state. The officials and managers would  receive part of the surplus value, but they would only be entitled to what Marx  called &ldquo;the wages of superintendence.&rdquo; We would have, to use Lenin&rsquo;s  expression, a bourgeois state without the bourgeoisie,&rdquo; or, in Trotsky&rsquo;s  expression, a state without Mandarins, a general staff without Samurai. In such  a state, the officials would have no special privileges. But given the  extremely low level of the productive forces and culture in Russia, the working  class was unable to run the state without the aid of the old tsarist officials  and army officers who from the beginning demanded, and got, salaries far in  excess of the average. Given the isolation of the Revolution in a backward  country, this was inevitable. This was the fundamental reason why the  proletariat was unable to maintain its hold on power. After the end of the  Civil War, the workers were gradually pushed aside by the up start officials  who felt themselves to be indispensable to the running of society.</p>
<p>
Lenin and Trotsky did not  envisage a situation where the Revolution could survive for long in the absence  of the victory of the workers of the advanced capitalist countries. They  assumed that, under such conditions, the capitalist elements would liquidate  the gains of October. This did not take place, although it was possible in the  1920s, particularly in the period of the New Economic Policy (NEP), when the  Bolsheviks were compelled to make big concessions to the rich peasants (&ldquo;kulaks&rdquo;)  and the nascent bourgeoisie (&ldquo;nepmen&rdquo;). Even before Lenin&rsquo;s death in 1924, a  section of the Party leadership, unconsciously reflecting the pressures of  alien classes carried the concessions to the kulaks to the point where a  bourgeois restoration was a serious danger. A section of the  counterrevolutionary &eacute;migr&eacute;s, Ustralyov&rsquo;s Smena Vekh (&ldquo;Change of Signpost&rdquo;)  group, even returned to Russia, in the belief that the Bolsheviks (or a section  of them) were becoming trans formed into bourgeois.</p>
<p>
Lenin took this danger very  seriously, and several times commented that Ustralyov might be right. It was at  that time that he pointed out that &ldquo;history knows transformations of all sorts.&rdquo;  He pointed to the existence of contradictory class tendencies within the Soviet  state, and affirmed that the decisive question was &ldquo;Who shall prevail.&rdquo; Shortly  before his last illness, he concluded a block with Trotsky to fight against the  Bureaucracy, which he feared was creating the conditions for the victory of  open bourgeois counterrevolution.</p>
<p>
On January 1921, Lenin  wrote:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;I stated, &lsquo;our state is in  reality not a workers&rsquo; state but a workers&rsquo; and peasants&rsquo; state.&rsquo; &hellip; On  reading the report of the discussion, I now see that I was wrong &hellip; I  should have said: &lsquo;The workers&rsquo; state is an abstraction. In reality we have a  workers&rsquo; state with the following peculiar features, (1) it is the peasants and  not the workers who predominate in the population and (2) it is a workers&rsquo;  state with bureaucratic deformations.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
In his last public  appearance at a political gathering, the Eleventh Congress of the RCP(B), Lenin  had warned that the state machine was escaping from the control of the  Communists: &ldquo;The machine refused to obey the hand that guided it. It was like a  car that was going not in the direction the driver desired, but in the  direction someone else desired; as if it were being driven by some mysterious  lawless hand, God knows whose, perhaps of a profiteer, or of a private  capitalist, or of both. Be that as it may, the car is not going quite in the  direction the man at the wheel imagines, and often it goes in an alto gether  different direction&hellip; </p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;If we take Moscow with its  4,700 Communists in responsible positions, and if we take that huge  bureaucratic machine, that gigantic heap, we must ask: who is directing whom? I  doubt very much whether it can truthfully be said that the Communists are  directing that heap. To tell the truth, they are not directing, they are being  directed.&rdquo; (Lenin, <em>Collected Works</em>, Vol. 33, pp. 279 and 288.)</p>
<p>
As we have seen, Marx  explains how, under certain conditions, the state can acquire a considerable  degree of independence, as under a Bonapartist regime. It would be foolish to  imagine that such a phenomenon could not, under certain conditions, occur even  in a workers&rsquo; state. The working class is not a &ldquo;Sacred Cow&rdquo; which possesses  miraculous powers to make it immune against degeneration. </p>
<p>
Endless mistakes occur when  we attempt to base ourselves on chemically pure abstractions instead of real  historical processes. Thus, we know what a trade union and a workers&rsquo; party is  supposed to look like. But history knows of all kinds of weird and wonderful  variants, of the most monstrously bureaucratised trade unions and corrupt  reformist parties. A workers&rsquo; state is roughly like a trade union in power.  Under conditions of extreme backwardness, such a state can experience a process  of bureaucratic degeneration. Stalinism, as Trotsky explains, is a peculiar  variant of Bonapartism&#8212;a regime of proletarian Bonapartism.</p>
<p>
It is not uncommon to hear  even experienced Marxists refer to the Soviet Union, China and Eastern Europe  as &ldquo;workers&rsquo; states.&rdquo; This is an unforgivable misuse of Marxist terminology. As  early as 1920, as we have seen, Lenin gave Bukharin a rap over the knuckles for  referring to Russia as a &ldquo;workers&rsquo; state.&rdquo; He insisted that it was necessary to  add &ldquo;with bureaucratic deformations.&rdquo; Of course at that time these were  comparatively mild deformations. Russia was a relatively healthy workers&rsquo; state  then. There is no compari son with the ghastly bureaucratic-totalitarian  monster that emerged under Stalin. Suffice it to recall Trotsky&rsquo;s remark that,  if you leave aside the nationalised planned economy, then the state in Stalin&rsquo;s  Russia could only be compared to a fascist state. To describe that monster as a  &ldquo;workers&rsquo; state&rdquo; is simply an abomination.</p>
<p>
The bureaucracy is not a &ldquo;Thing-in-itself.&rdquo;  It exists in a given society, and can reflect different class interests. In the  1920s, there was a section of the bureaucracy that stood close to the kulaks  and nepmen and was in favour of capitalist restoration. The spokesman of this  trend was one of the Old Bolshevik leaders, Bukharin. Of course, he did not  consciously aspire to restore the old regime. But unconsciously, he was  reflecting the pressures of the bourgeois elements. On the other hand, Trotsky  and the Left Opposition stood con sciously for the defence of the interests of  the proletariat. Stalin, who had no real idea where he was going, balanced  between the different wings, but represented the millions of officials in the  state, industry and Party, who were seeking to enlarge their own power and  privileges.</p>
<p>
In his important last work,  <em>Stalin</em>, Trotsky provides a profoundly scientific analysis of the struggle  between the bureaucracy and the nascent bourgeoisie in the pe riod 1924-9.  These lines, unfortunately not sufficiently known to Marxists, shed a lot of  light on the struggle that is now unfolding before our eyes in Russia:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The kulak, jointly with  the petty industrialist, worked for the complete restoration of capitalism.  Thus opened the irreconcilable struggle over the surplus product of national  labour. Who will dispose of it in the nearest future&#8212;the new  bourgeoisie or the Soviet bureaucracy?&#8212;that became the next issue.  He who dis poses of the surplus product has the power of the state at his dis  posal. It was this that opened the struggle between the petty-bourgeoisie,  which had helped the bu reaucracy to crush the resistance of the labouring  masses and of their spokesman the Left Opposition, and the Thermidorian  bureaucracy itself, which had helped the petty-bour geoisie to lord it over the  agrarian masses. It was a direct struggle for power and for income.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Obviously the bureaucracy  did not rout the proletarian vanguard, pull free from the complications of the  international revolution, and legitimise the philosophy of inequality in order  to capitulate before the bourgeoisie, become the latter&rsquo;s servant, and be  eventually itself pulled away from the state feed-bag.&rdquo; (<em>Stalin</em>, p.397.)</p>
<p>
Here we have, in a few  words, a marvellously precise account of the class basis of the struggle  between different layers of the bureaucracy. The conflict consists of the  struggle for the expropriation of the surplus value, which, in turn, gives to  whoever possesses it control of the state. The difference between the  bureaucracy and the nascent bourgeoisie can thus be reduced to two different  ways of appropriating the surplus value. But this is not a secondary question.  The bourgeoisie directly appropriates surplus value on the basis of private  ownership of the means of production. The bureaucracy derives its power, income  and privileges from state ownership. Indeed, the only progressive function it  played was in defending state ownership, although, as Trotsky pointed out, it  defended the USSR far less than it defended its own privileges. Nevertheless  the interests of the bureaucracy which depends on the nationalised economy for  its position were in conflict with the aspirations and interests of the nascent  bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>
Despite this, Trotsky was  careful to place a question mark over the future of the Soviet state. He did  not exclude the possibility at a certain stage that the process of bureaucratic  counterrevolution would lead to the over throw of the property relations  established by the October Revolution:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The counter-revolution  sets in when the spool of progressive social conquests begins to unwind. There  seems no end to this unwinding. Yet some portion of the conquests of the  revolution is always preserved. Thus, in spite of monstrous bureaucratic  distortions, the class basis of the USSR remains proletarian. But let us bear  in mind that the unwinding process has not yet been completed, and the future  of Europe and the world during the next few decades has not yet been decided.  The Russian Thermidor would have undoubtedly opened a new era of bourgeois  rule, if that rule had not proved obsolete throughout the world. At any rate,  the struggle against equality and the establishment of very deep social  differentiations has so far been unable to eliminate the socialist  consciousness of the masses or the nationalisation of the means of production  and the land which were the basic socialist conquests of the revolution.  Although it derogates these achievements, the bureau cracy has not yet ventured  to resort to the restoration of the private ownership of the means of  production.&rdquo; (<em>Stalin</em>, pp.405-6, our emphasis.)</p>
<p>
Trotsky did not provide a  finished, once-and-for-all anal ysis of the class nature of the Soviet state,  but left the question open as to which direction it would finally take. This  would be determined by the struggle of living forces, which was in turn  inseparably connected with developments on a world scale:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;It is impossible at  present to answer finally and irrevocably the question in what direction the  economic contradictions and social antagonisms of Soviet society will develop  in the course of the next three, five or ten years. The outcome depends upon a  struggle of living social forces&#8212;not on a national scale, either,  but on an international scale. At every new stage, therefore, a concrete  analysis is necessary of actual relations and tendencies in their connection  and continual interaction.&rdquo; (<em>The Revolution Betrayed</em>, p. 49.)</p>
<h4>
Eastern Europe after the  War</h4>
<p>
As Trotsky had tentatively  suggested in his last work, the proletarian Bonapartist regime in Russia lasted  for decades. This was a result, firstly, of the victory of the USSR in the  Second World War, an event which radically changed the correlation of forces on  a world scale; secondly, the extension of the revolution to Eastern Europe by  Bonapartist means meant the establishment, not of healthy worker&rsquo; states like  that of October 1917, but of monstrously deformed workers&rsquo; states in the image  of Stalin&rsquo;s Moscow.</p>
<p>
Trotsky explained that the  main danger to the nationalised planned economy was not so much a military  defeat as the cheap consumer goods that would arrive in the baggage train of an  imperialist army. As it happened, Hitler&rsquo;s armies brought, not cheap  commodities, but gas chambers. As a result, not just the working class, but the  peasants fought like tigers to defend the Soviet Union. The victory of the USSR  in the War was one of the main factors that allowed the Stalinist regime to  survive for decades after 1945. To the workers of Russia and the world, it  appeared that the bureaucracy was playing a progressive role, not just in  defending the planned economy against Hitler, but in extending the nationalised  property forms to Eastern Europe, and, later China. In reality, these  revolutions began where the Russian Revolution finished&#8212;as  monstrously deformed regimes of proletarian Bonapartism. The installation of  such regimes, far from weakening the Moscow bureaucracy, enormously  strengthened it for a whole historical period.</p>
<p>
The peculiar way in which  the revolution took place in Eastern Europe was outlined by Ted Grant in a  document published at that time:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;In Europe, the victory of  Russia in the war and the up surge of the masses following the defeat of  German-Italian fascism also developed a tremendous revolution ary wave which  threatened to sweep capitalism away over the entire continent. However, the  victory of Russia in the war had complex and contradictory conse quences.  Temporarily, but nevertheless for an en tire his torical period, Stalinism has  been enormously strength ened. Despite the destruction and blood letting to  which Russia had been subjected, which left her in an ex hausted and weak state  (while Anglo-American imperialism had hardly been touched during the war and  suf fered negligible losses in resources and manpower, America had reached the  apex of her power militarily and economically), because of the mood of the  peoples and the relationship of class forces on a world scale, the imperialists  were impotent to intervene against Russia.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Intervention even on a  scale following that of World War I was impossible. On the contrary, the allies  were forced to swallow the Russian hegemony of Eastern Europe and parts of Asia  which they would never have agreed to concede even to reactionary Czarism. The  Russian bureaucracy had achieved the domination of the region beyond the  wildest dreams of Russia under the Czars.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The process whereby  capitalism was over thrown in Eastern Europe and Stalinism extended, took place  in a peculiar way. The vacuum in the state power in Eastern Europe, following  the defeat of the Nazis and their Quislings, was filled by the forces of the  conquering Red Army. The weak bourgeoisie of these areas had been largely  exterminated, absorbed as Quislings to German imperialism or reduced to minor  partners of the Nazis during the years of the war. They had been relatively  weak in Eastern Europe even before the war, as the states of this region were  largely semi-colonies of the great powers on the lines of the South American states.  The pre-war regimes suffered from a chronic crisis due to the Balkanisation of  the area and the incapacity of the ruling class to solve the problems of even  the bourgeois democratic revolution. They were nearly all military police  dictatorships of a weak character without any real roots among the masses.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The victory of Russia  during the war undoubtedly provoked an upsurge among the masses either rapidly  or in some countries, delayed for a time. The so cialist revolution was on the  order of the day. This was dangerous not only for the bourgeoisie but also the  Stalinist bu reaucracy. The bureaucracy achieved their aims by skil fully  veering between and manipulating the classes in typically Bonapartist fashion.  The trick was to form a &lsquo;popular front&rsquo; between the classes and to organise a  government of &lsquo;national concentration.&rsquo; However this &lsquo;popular front&rsquo; had a  different basis, and different aims in view than the &lsquo;popular fronts&rsquo; of the  past.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;In Spain the aim of the &lsquo;popular  front&rsquo; was to destroy the powers of the workers and the embryonic workers&rsquo;  state, by destroying the workers&rsquo; revolution. This was achieved by making an  alliance with the bourgeoisie, or rather the shadow of the bourgeoisie,  strangling the control which the workers had established in the, factories and  the armed workers&rsquo; militia and re-establishing the capitalist state under the  control of the bourgeoisie. As a consequence of this policy towards the end of  the war there was a military police dictatorship on both sides of the lines.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The aim of the coalition  with the broken bourgeoisie or its shadow in Eastern Europe had different  objectives than that of handing control back to the capitalist class. In  previous &lsquo;popular fronts&rsquo; the real power of a state&#8212;armed bodies of  men, police and the state apparatus&#8212;was firmly in the hands of the  bourgeoisie with the workers&rsquo; parties as appendages. In Eastern Europe, with  one important variation or another, the real power i.e. control of the armed  bodies of men and the state apparatus, was in the hands of the Stalinists. The  bourgeoisie occupied the position of appendage without the real power. Why then  the coalition? It served as a cover under which a firm state machine on the  model of that of Moscow, could be constructed and consolidated.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The bourgeoisie was  utilised by the bureaucracy in order to prevent the workers, awakened by the  victory of the Red Army and the events of the war, from achieving the socialist  revolution on the lines of October. The bureaucracy played off the bourgeoisie  in the name of unity against the working class. They manipulated with  Bonapartist manoeuvres the groping as pirations of the workers to establish  control of the factories.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;By introducing land reform  and expropriating the land lord class, they secured for the time being the  support or acquiescence of the peasants. Having consolidated and built up a  strong state under their control they then proceeded to the next stage.  Mobilising the workers, they turned on the bourgeoisie, whom they no longer  required, to balance against the workers and peasants, and step by step they  proceeded to their expropriation. The bourgeoisie without the support of  outside imperialism was incapable of decisive resistance. A totalitarian regime  approximating more and more to the Moscow model has been gradually introduced.  After the elimination of the bourgeoisie, and the beginning of a large scale  industrialisation the bureaucracy has turned against the peasants and started  on the road of the collectivisation of agriculture.&rdquo; (<em><a href="../../1951/06/stalinism.htm">Stalinism in the Postwar  Period</a></em>, June 1951.)</p>
<h4>The Chinese Revolution</h4>
<p>
An analogous event occurred  when Mao took power in China at the head of a peasant army in 1949. Up to the  Russian revolution even Lenin denied the possibility of the victory of the  proletarian revolution in a backward country. The revolution of 1944-49 did not  proceed on the model of 1917 or of the Chinese revolution of 1925-27. It was a  peasant war, which took place be cause of the complete incapacity of the  bourgeoisie to carry out the tasks of the bourgeois-democratic  revolution&#8212;the ending of landlordism, national unification and the  expulsion of imperialism&#8212;it ended with victory to the Chinese  Stalinists.</p>
<p>
Mao, in typical Bonapartist  fashion on the basis of the peasant army, always an instrument of (bourgeois)  Bonapartism in the past, balanced between the classes. Having perfected a state  in the image of Moscow, leaning on the workers and peasants, he could snuff out  the bourgeoisie painlessly. As Trotsky put it, for a lion you need a gun, for a  flea, a fingernail will do! Therefore, having balanced between the bourgeoisie  and the workers and peasants in order to prevent the workers from taking power,  Mao and his gang&#8212;after perfecting the state&#8212;could then  crush the bourgeoisie before turning on the workers and peasants to crush  whatever elements of workers&rsquo; democracy had developed.</p>
<p>
The bureaucracy then  developed a totalitarian one-party dictatorship, centred round the Bonapartist  dictatorship of one single individual&#8212;Mao. But, not for nothing has  Marxist theory given the task of achieving the socialist revolution and the  transition to socialism to the working class. This is not an arbitrary affirmation.  It is a product of the specific role in production of the proletariat which  gives it a specific consciousness possessed by no other class. Least of all can  the petit-bourgeois peasant develop this consciousness. A revolution based on  that class by its very nature would be doomed to degeneration and Bonapartism.  It is precisely because a proletarian Bonapartist dictatorship protects the  privileges of the elite of state, party, the army, industry and the  intellectuals of art and science that it has succeeded in so many backward  countries.</p>
<p>
The programme of the  Chinese Stalinists was not fundamentally different to that of Castro later in  Cuba: 50 or 100 years of &ldquo;national capitalism&rdquo; and an alliance with the &ldquo;national  bourgeoisie.&rdquo; Hence the belief of many American bourgeois that they were &ldquo;agrarian  reformers.&rdquo; Only the Marxist tendency in Britain argued against the Stalinists  and the alleged &ldquo;Trotskyist&rdquo; sects and explained the inevitability of Mao&rsquo;s  victory and the establishment of a deformed workers&rsquo; state. At a time when Mao  and the Chinese CP had the programme of capitalism and &ldquo;national democracy&rdquo; we  could predict the inevitability of proletarian Bonapartism as the next stage in  China. This had nothing in common with the methods of the proletarian  revolution in Russia in 1917.</p>
<p>
Power was gained through  the peasant war by giving land to the soldiers in Chiang Kai Shek&rsquo;s army. Then,  by balancing between the classes and playing them off against each other in  Bonapartist fashion, once military victory was achieved, landlordism and  capitalism were expropriated. Nearly all the so-called &ldquo;Trotskyist&rdquo; sects  latter accepted the accomplished fact. But never before in history had it even  been theoretically posed that a peasant war on classical lines could lead to a  workers&rsquo; state, however deformed. The workers in China were passive throughout  the civil war for reasons we will not enter here. But here was a perfect ex  ample of one class&#8212;the peasants in the form of the Red  Army&#8212;carrying out the tasks of another.</p>
<p>
From a Marxist standpoint,  it is an aberration to think that such a process is &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; It can only be  explained by the impasse of capitalism in China, the paralysis of imperialism,  the existence of a strong deformed Bonapartist state in Stalinist Russia, and  most important of all, the delay in the victory in the industrially advance  countries of the world. The colonial countries could not wait. The problems  were too crushing. There was no way forward on the basis of capitalism. Hence  the peculiar aberrations in colonial countries. But the price for this, as in  the Soviet Union, would be a second political revolution to put the control of  society, industry and the state in the hands of the proletariat. Only thus  could the first genuine beginnings of the transition of socialism, or rather  steps in that direction, commence.</p>
<p>
A similar process occurred  later in Cuba, where Castro came to power on the basis of a guerrilla war. The  wide support for &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; not only among the working class, but among the  peasants and wide layers of the petit-bourgeoisie in the cities in colonial  countries, was the expression of the complete blind alley of landlordism and  capitalism in the colonial world in the modern epoch. It was also a result of  the Russian and Chinese revolutions and their achievements in developing  industry and the economy. It was this that laid the groundwork for the  development of proletarian Bonapartism. In the last analysis, the state can be  reduced to armed bodies of men. With the defeat and destruction of the police  and army of Chiang Kai Shek, with the destruction of the army of Batista in  Cuba, power was in the hands respectively of Mao and Castro. The fact that  nominally Mao was a &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; and Castro a bourgeois democrat altered nothing.</p>
<p>
The rule of the Russian  bureaucracy would have been swiftly undermined by the coming to power of the  workers along classical lines in these countries. But in Eastern Europe and  China, the old bourgeois state was destroyed, and replaced by a regime of  proletarian Bonapartism. They began where the Russian Revolution had ended. The  establishment of such regimes presented no threat to Moscow. On the contrary,  it strengthened the stranglehold of the bureaucracy for a whole period.</p>
<h4>Proletarian Bonapartism</h4>
<p>
The main reason for the  survival of the Stalinist regimes for such a long time was the world-wide  tendency towards statisation, reflected in the advanced capitalist countries by  the continual encroachment of the state even in the period of the post-war up  swing. This fact was a striking indication of the limits of private ownership.  In all capitalist countries we saw a tendency towards Keynesianism, measures of  nationalisation and &ldquo;state capitalism.&rdquo; Incidentally, together with the huge  expansion of world trade, this was one of the factors which enabled them,  partially and for a temporary period, to overcome the limitations of the  system, achieving results that have no precedent in the history of capitalism.</p>
<p>
The tendency towards  statisation of the productive forces, which have grown beyond the limits of  private ownership, was manifest in the most highly developed economies and  even in the most reactionary colonial countries. There is no possibility of a  consistent, uninterrupted and continuous increase in the productive forces in  the countries of the so-called third world on a capitalist basis. Production  stagnates or falls. In the colonial world, the national bourgeoisie, having  come to power on the backs of the masses, was compelled to carry out measures of  nationalisation. Every one of the bourgeois demagogues&#8212;Nasser,  Nkrumah, Kenyatta, Nehru, Sukarno, Nyrere&#8212;described themselves as &ldquo;socialists.&rdquo;  This fact is a reflection of the impasse of capitalism in the modern epoch, its  inability to solve the problems of society, particularly in the backward  economies of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Marxism finds in the  development of the productive forces the key to the development of society. On  a capitalist basis there is no longer a way forward, particularly for backward  countries. That is why army officers, intellectuals and others, affected by the  decay of their societies can under certain conditions switch their allegiance.  Allegiance to proletarian Bonapartism actually enlarges their power, prestige,  privileges and income. They become the sole commanding and directing stratum of  the society, raising themselves even higher over the masses than in the past.  Instead of being subservient to the weak, craven and ineffectual bourgeoisie  they become the masters of society.</p>
<p>
In capitalist countries in  the past, the bourgeoisie had a role to play and looked forward confidently to  the future&#8212;i.e. it is genuinely progressive in developing the  productive forces. It had decades and generations to perfect the state as an  instrument of its own class rule. The army, police, civil service, middle  layers and especially all key positions at the top; heads of civil service,  heads of departments, police chiefs, the colonels and generals are carefully  selected to serve the needs and interests of the ruling class. With a developed  economy and a mission and a role to play they eagerly serve the &ldquo;national  interest&rdquo; i.e. the interest of the possessing class&#8212;the ruling  class. However, the situation is completely different in the backward  capitalist regimes which emerged from the colonial revolution.</p>
<p>
Bonapartist regimes do not  rest on air but balance between the classes. In the final analysis they  represent whichever is the dominant class in society. The relation of the state  to the productive forces in the last analysis determines its class character.  Some of these countries, as in Latin America, a semi-colonial continent which  was under the domination of British then especially American imperialism for  the last century, nevertheless, have been nominally independent for more than a  century. In consequence, despite a period of turbulence the ruling class of  landowners and capitalists has had sufficient time to perfect their state.  Sometimes the armed forces of different fractions or factions of armed forces,  can reflect different fractions of the ruling class and even the pressures of  imperialism, primarily American imperialism. But, up to now, they have always  reflected the interest of the ruling class in the defence of private ownership.</p>
<p>
The officer caste must  reflect the interest of some class or grouping in society. They do not  represent themselves though of course they can plunder society and elevate  themselves into a ruling caste. As in all the ex-colonial countries, the  imperialists (in this case the French) were compelled to relinquish military  domination of Syria, partly under the pressure of their rivals, especially  American imperialism. The state which emerged was not fixed and static. The  weakness and incapacity of the bourgeoisie gave a certain independence to the  military caste. Hence the endless military coups and counter-coups. But in the  last analysis they reflected the class interests of the ruling class. They  could not play an independent role. The struggle between the cliques in the  army reflected the instability and contradictions in the given society. The  personal aims of the generals reflected the differing interests of social  classes or fractions of classes in society, the petit-bourgeois in its various  strata, the bourgeoisie, or even under certain conditions the proletariat.</p>
<h4>Burma and Ethiopia</h4>
<p>
In Burma, the regime had  newly emerged from British domination and the ruling class was incapable of successfully holding the country together. Facing a series of rebellions and wars,  the army was formed from the Anti-Fascist Peoples Freedom League, which described itself as &ldquo;socialist.&rdquo; Tired of the incapacity of the landowners and  capitalists to solve the problems of Burma, and with China as a model next  door, the army leaders, based themselves on the support of the workers and  peasants to organise a coup. They expropriated the landowners and capitalists  and established Burma as a &ldquo;Burmese Buddhist Socialist State.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
As Marx long ago explained,  there is no such thing as a supra-historical blue-print. It is necessary to  take the material objective reality as it is and then explain it. That is the  method of Marxist philosophy. It is not only necessary to see objective reality  as it is, but to explain the process that brought it into being, the  contradictions encompassing it, the law of social movement which it represents  and the future processes of contradictions and change which will envelop it.  Its process of birth, development, decay and the changes which will destroy it.</p>
<p>
The decay of  capitalism-landlordism in the colonial countries aggravates all the social  contradictions to an extreme. Social tensions reach an unbearable level. Hence  in one country after another in Asia, Africa and Latin America, bourgeois  democracy is replaced by bourgeois Bonapartist dictatorships or proletarian  Bonapartist dictatorships. In the above-named ex-colonial countries not one  proceeded on the model of the norm of the socialist revolution. Neither did the  countries of Eastern Europe before them in the aftermath of the Second World  War.</p>
<p>
Under conditions of social  crisis people change. This applies to classes and even individuals. Thus Marx  explained that with the decay of feudalism a section of the feudal lords,  bigger or smaller as the case may be, goes over to the side of the bourgeoisie  in the bourgeois revolution. A section of the bourgeoisie, particularly the  intellectual bourgeoisie, can also put themselves on the standpoint of the  proletariat. No more barren, formalistic, anti-dialectical, philosophically  idealist, anti-&ldquo;Marxist philosophy&rdquo; idea in the history of the movement has  been put forward than by those who argue that because Castro began his  revolutionary struggle as a bourgeois democrat with bourgeois democratic ideas  and goals that therefore he must remain a bourgeois democrat for all eternity.  They forget that Marx and Engels themselves began as bourgeois democrats who  broke decisively with the bourgeoisie and became leaders of the proletariat.</p>
<p>
The crisis of capitalism in  Portugal, a semi-colonial country, affected the officer caste. The majority of  the officers, sickened by the decades of dictatorship and the seemingly  unending wars in Africa which they realised they could not win, moved in the  direction of revolution and &ldquo;socialism.&rdquo; Only our tendency explained this  process. This gave an impetus to the movement of the working class, which then  reacted in its turn on the army. This affected not only the rank and file, and  the lower ranks of the officers, but even some admirals and generals who were  sincerely desirous of solving the problems of Portuguese society and the  Portuguese people.</p>
<p>
This was something that  would have been impossible in previous revolutions. The overwhelming majority  of the officer caste supported Franco in the Spanish civil war. True enough,  because of the reformist and Stalinist betrayal of the Portuguese revolution  which prevented it from being carried through to completion, there has been a  reaction. The army has been purged and purged again to become a more reliable  instrument of the bourgeoisie. This demonstrated the need for a genuine dialectical understanding and interpretation of the events of the present epoch. If  such a transformation was possible, in a semicolonial but imperialist  capitalist Portugal, how much more could similar processes take place in the  newly independent countries of Africa and of Asia?</p>
<p>
Events in Ethiopia  strikingly confirmed the theses we had worked out. There the famine brought  about by Haile Selassie and the landlord nobility was the last catastrophe even  the officer caste was prepared to tolerate. The callous indifference of the  Emperor and the landlord class to the famine and the death from starvation of  hundreds of thousands and possibly even millions, plus the accumulated social  contradictions in a backward country under the pressure of imperialism, pushed  the middle layers of the officer caste to organise a coup.</p>
<p>
This in its turn awakened  the movement of the small working class in Addis Abbaba and the students and  petit-bourgeois layers in the capital and in the towns. It also awakened the  peasantry into a cataclysmic movement to gain control of land. Thus the 1000  year old &ldquo;empire&rdquo; and its class structure crumbled to dust. The crisis in the  army and the attempts at counter-revolution, the further impetus this gave to  the guerrilla war in Eritrea, the guerrilla war in the Ogaden, aided by the  direct intervention of Somalia, the uprisings of the Galla and other tribes,  all acted as a spur to the revolution. </p>
<p>
The movement of the classes  in turn had its effect on the new ruling junta in the army. It produced splits  and individual and group conspiracies of officers. These reflected the classes  in battle in Ethiopia and the developing civil war in the whole country.  Whatever the individual whims of the officers, they reflected (as in  Syria)&#8212;and had to reflect&#8212;the class struggle taking  place. Hardly any wished for a return to the old regime. The model of the  Emperor&rsquo;s landlord semi-feudal regime was rejected by the bulk of the officer  caste. But there were differences as to how far to go, which ended in armed  conflicts and executions. In a distorted way, this reflected the struggle of  the classes in Ethiopia. This process ended in the victory of Lieutenant  Colonel Mengistu. Already the land had been divided among the peasants and  industry nationalised without compensation to the imperialists and the native  capitalists (though of course compensation is not necessarily the decisive  factor).</p>
<p>
In the struggles Lieutenant  Colonel Mengistu emerged victorious as a Bonapartist dictator under the  influence of the wars and civil wars. In order to obtain mass support Mengistu,  formerly a high-up officer of the Emperor, had been forced to go all the way.  He had declared himself a &ldquo;Marxist-Leninist&rdquo; (probably without reading a single  word of Marx or Lenin) and set about creating a one party &ldquo;Marxist-Leninist&rdquo;  totalitarian dictatorship. This is in the image of Moscow or Peking. The  landlords and capitalist were expropriated and the imperialist countries are  without real influence on the processes taking place in Ethiopia. In this case  the process is clear. It is even clearer than in Mozambique, Angola or the  former Aden, and this without a direct struggle against imperialist occupation.  The imperialists were too weak and debilitated to intervene directly by  military means and could only grind their teeth in impotence.</p>
<p>
The coup in Afghanistan in  1979 proceeded along the same lines. Such developments cannot be understood  unless the state is approached from a dialectical point of view. The main thing  to see is how under certain conditions the ruling stratum, when faced with a  complete social and economic impasse, can shift from one system of class  domination to another. Of course, this means only the substitution of one  oppressive ruling elite by another. Under no circumstances can such a  transition lead to socialism or a healthy workers&rsquo; state. That would presuppose  the active and conscious participation of the masses under the leadership of  the working class organised in soviets. Nevertheless, it is not a matter of  indifference whether such a movement takes a capitalist or anti-capitalist  character. In the absence of a socialist revolution in the West or a classical  workers&rsquo; revolution as in 1917, the regimes of proletarian Bonapartism  undoubtedly represented a blow against imperialism, landlordism and capitalism,  and as such were welcomed by the Marxists, which nevertheless explained that  the working class in these countries would later have to pay the price with a  new revolution.</p>
<h4>Crisis of proletarian  Bonapartism</h4>
<p>
At a time when the  productive forces were experiencing rapid growth in the USSR and China, and  capitalism proved incapable of developing the economy in most of the  underdeveloped world, especially in the most backward areas, the attractive  power of Russia and China created the conditions for the establishment of  regimes of proletarian Bonapartism in Ethiopia, Somalia and Afghanistan,  following the earlier examples of Syria and Burma, through the action of the  military caste itself.</p>
<p>
In Angola and Mozambique,  two extremely backward African countries which for decades had waged a  guerrilla war against Portuguese imperialism, the coming to power of peasant  armies of national liberation under these conditions led to the establishment  of proletarian Bonapartist regimes on the model of China and Cuba. This could  have meant the collapse of capitalism in the whole African continent, something  which could not be accepted by the imperialists. Utilising the services of the  apartheid regime of South Africa, the imperialists armed, organised and trained  gangs of thieves, scum, and lumpenproletarians in order to wreck and plunder  these new deformed workers&rsquo; states. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the  ruling caste, which had been unable to develop the productive forces as a  result of the sabotage of imperialism, was compelled to turn again in the  direction of capitalism. In Ethiopia, the Mengistu regime suffered a similar  fate as a result of its failure to solve the national problem.</p>
<p>
Cuba, like Vietnam and  North Korea, has so far managed to survive as a deformed workers&rsquo; state, although it has been compelled to introduce something like an &ldquo;NEP&rdquo; economy which  has elements of capitalism, but where the decisive sectors of the economy remain in the hands of the state. Until the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba was  financed and subsided by Moscow. Despite the ferocious blockade imposed by the  USA, the regime has been able to maintain itself, partly because of the role of  Castro, and also because the masses recognise the enormous gains of the  Revolution, which, in part, still remain. Real GDP growth in Cuba resumed in  1994 and rose 2.5% in 1995. The government expects 5% growth in 1996. Despite  the US embargo, which has been in force since 1961, trade has improved. Exports  began to rise in 1994, growing by 20% in 1995, and are forecast to rise by a  further 20% this year. The trade deficit is shrinking.</p>
<p>
Very little has been  privatised. There are some joint-venture firms, set up with foreign  participation, and the government plans to allow 100% foreign-owned companies  in special free-trade zones, on the Chinese model. Five years ago, there were  almost no capitalist companies investing in Cuba. Now the stock of foreign investment has reached $2.1 billion and companies from 50 countries operate  there. About 200000 Cubans are self-employed. But, says one report of the  strategists of capital: &ldquo;There are no official plans to set up a stock exchange, so traditional privatisation is still a long way off.&rdquo; (Our emphasis.)</p>
<p>
The capitalist  counterrevolution succeeded in overthrowing the proletarian bonapartist regimes  in Mozambique, Angola, Ethiopia and Afghanistan. Syria and Burma have not yet  gone down that road. Nor have the other Asian Stalinist regimes in Vietnam,  North Korea, Laos and Cambodia. In Asia, events took a different turn, because  of the powerful domination of China. Here, the bureaucracy also partially  introduced elements of capitalism, but maintaining a firm grip on the state.  The Vietnamese bureaucracy has made peace with China, and is attempting to  pursue the Chinese model, as is Cuba. However, the fate of all these regimes,  including Cuba, will be decided by developments on a world scale, and  particularly the destiny of Russia and China. </p>
<p>
In order to explain the  present evolution of the bureaucracy in Russia, Eastern Europe, China and the  other regimes of proletarian Bonapartism, it is first necessary to understand  how the latter arose historically. Our tendency explained how proletarian  Bonapartism arose out of the impasse of the productive forces on a world scale  under capitalism, and the delay of the proletarian revolution in the West.  Under these conditions, the crisis of capitalism found its expression in a  general tendency towards statisation of the productive forces. Now it seems  that the process has been thrown into reverse.</p>
<p>
The main reason why the  Stalinist regime in Russia lasted so long was, on the one hand, the delay in  the proletarian revolution in the West, and, on the other hand, the world-wide  tendency towards statisation. Even in the period of the post-war economic  upswing in capitalism, this tendency asserted itself in the encroachment of  the state in the advanced capitalist countries (Keynesianism, &ldquo;state capitalism&rdquo;).  During the 1950s and early 1960s, the nationalised planned economy maintained  high rates of growth. The bureaucracy felt itself to be a progressive force.  Its self-confidence was reflected in Khrushchov&rsquo;s speech at the 22nd Party  Congress in 1961, when he boasted that the Soviet Union would overtake the USA  in all fields within 20 years. The working class, despite all the crimes of the  bureaucracy, was prepared to tolerate it temporarily because it was still  playing a relatively progressive role in developing the productive forces.</p>
<p>
The following factors have  had a decisive in fluence on events in Russia and Eastern Europe:</p>
<p class="fst">
1) The bureaucracy found  itself in an impasse and unable to develop the means of production on the old  basis.<br />
2) A long period of  isolation resulted in the complete decay of the bureaucracy.<br />
3) After decades of  Stalinist totalitarianism, the proletariat was disoriented.<br />
4) The temporary passivity  of the working class as a result of 3). <br />
5) The delay of the  socialist revolution in the West.<br />
6) The historical &ldquo;accident&rdquo;  of the boom of 1982-90, which created the illusion that capitalism could offer  a way out.<br />
7) This gave a temporary  access of confidence to the imperialists, who exerted pressure on Gorbachov to  move in a capitalist direction. <br />
8) The exhaustion of the  model of &ldquo;state capitalism&rdquo; in the advanced capitalist countries resulted in a  temporary reversal of the tendency towards statisation on a world scale.<br />
9) The absence of an  independent movement of the Russian workers, combined with the intense pressure  of world imperialism, strengthened the pro-capitalist wing of the bureaucracy,  and prevented the emergence of a proletarian wing as anticipated by Trotsky  before the war.<br />
10) The relative  independence of the proletarian bonapartist state enabled the leading clique  around Yeltsin to manoeuvre between the classes and sections of the  bureaucracy, initially leaning on world imperialism, in an attempt to move  towards capitalism.<br />
11) In this way, we have a  contradictory hybrid situation, in which the bourgeois government of Yeltsin,  under the pressure of imperialism, is striving to complete the transition to  capitalism. <br />
12) This peculiar process  is not yet completed. The result will be decided by the struggle of  contradictory forces in Russian society and the state.<br />
13) The result of this will  be determined by the class balance of forces in Russia and events on a world  scale.</p>
<p>
In the period from 1948 to  1975, world capitalism temporarily succeeded in overcoming its central  contradictions through the development of world trade, and, to some extent,  through measures of &ldquo;state capitalism.&rdquo; However, as predicted by the Marxists,  keynesian policies inevitably led to an explosion of inflation. Partial  statisation did not solve the problems and merely created new contradictions.  The realisation of this fact has produced a swing in the opposite direction in  the past period. This, in turn, is the expression of the fact that the entire  post-war model of world capitalism, which for a period gave spectacular  results, has exhausted itself. The attempt to go back to more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; methods  will produce further convulsions on a world scale. We should remember the  effects of the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; policies of balanced budgets and &ldquo;sound finance&rdquo; in  the period between the wars.</p>
<p>
In its desperate search for  a field of investment, the bourgeoisie resorts to what is, in effect, the  looting of the state through the privatisation of the nationalised industries  and public utilities. Far from representing a progressive development, this is  an expression of the dead end of capitalism. Of course, in the short term,  spectacular profits are made by the big monopolies, but only at the cost of  further closures, sackings, cuts in living standards and state expenditure,  which must mean a further reduction of the market and aggravation of the  crisis. The enthusiasm of the bourgeoisie for these policies is proof of the  old saying, &ldquo;whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Not content with the  results of this policy at home, they seek to inflict it on the whole world. The  same search for a field of investment leads them to compel the ex-colonial countries  to go down the same road of denationalisation. In the past, the colonial  bourgeoisie was able to balance between imperialism and the deformed workers&#8217; states in Russia and China. Now this is impossible. They are forced to open  their markets to predatory imperialism. Their national industries are sold off  for a song, not to local capitalists, but to the big multinationals. This will  prepare a mighty explosion against capitalism and imperialism in the coming  period.</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Every action has an equal  and opposite reaction.&rdquo; This law applies not only to physics but to society.  The drive towards privatisation will reach its limits. This is already  beginning to happen in Britain. At a certain stage, the tendency towards  statisation will reassert itself. Nevertheless, for the last ten years or so,  the reaction against statisation appeared to give results, coinciding with the  boom of 1982 to 90. This had a profound effect on the evolution of Russia and  Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>
Trotsky always showed the  dialectical relationship between the rise of Stalinism in Russia and the  development of world capitalism. He explained that the Thermidorian reaction in  Russia would have led to the restoration of capitalism, if capitalism had not  shown itself to be exhausted on a world scale. In the 1930s, the striking  successes of the first five-year plans coincided with the greatest slump in the  history of capitalism. Although capitalism recovered in the period following  the Second World War, achieving annual growth rates of 5 to 6% in the USA and  Western Europe, and even more in Japan, the Soviet economy achieved even higher  averages&#8212;10 or 11%, without recessions, unemployment or inflation.</p>
<p>
Under these circumstances,  the regime of proletarian Bonapartism in Russia was able, not only to survive,  but to consolidate itself. It acted as an important point of reference,  together with China, to the masses of the ex-colonial world.</p>
<p>
However, for the reasons  already outlined, the system of bureaucratically controlled planned economy  reached its limits by the mid 1960s. The rate of growth in the USSR declined  continually throughout the 1970s. This was also the case with the other more  industrialised de formed workers&rsquo; states of Eastern Europe. Despite its earlier  successes, proletarian Bonapartism did not solve the problems of society. In  reality, it represented a monstrous historical anomaly, the result of a  peculiar historical concatenation of circumstances. The ruthless pressure of  imperialism, which did not shirk from using the services of the most barbarous  forces in society, brought about the collapse of the proletarian bonapartist  regimes in Mozambique, Angola and Afghanistan. The Mengistu regime in Ethiopia  foundered on the rock of the national question, the Achilles&rsquo; heel of all  Stalinist regimes throughout history.</p>
<p>
The situation in China was  different. Starting from a more backward basis, the Chinese bureaucracy faced a  position far more similar to that of the Stalinist regime in Russia in the  1930s. The difference is shown by the fact that Beijing is developing the  productive forces at a far faster rate than any other country in the world.  This means that it is still able to play a relatively progres sive role.  Although there are important elements of capitalism, the bureaucracy maintains  an iron grip on the state. Paradoxically, this is what makes China such an  attractive proposition to foreign investors, although that can easily change  into its opposite in the coming period.</p>
<p>
For the time being, the  rapid growth of production is the explanation of the relative stability of the  Chinese bureaucracy in contrast to the situation in Russia and Eastern Europe.  The ruling elite feels confident in its historic mission. It is motivated, in  part of course by the desire to preserve and augment its power, income and  privileges, but also by the aim of creating a modern and powerful China (under  its control, naturally). The successes of the Beijing regime give some hope to  the rulers of North Korea, Cuba and even perhaps Vietnam, where there has been  little or no movement towards capitalism. China remains a point of reference  for these regimes. If it were to go towards capitalism, these would also  collapse. However, this seems unlikely as long as the &ldquo;old men&rdquo; remain in  control. In common with all the ex-Stalinists, they are guided by purely  empirical considerations. They have taken note of the disaster in Russia, and  have no intention of going down that road. As with Russia, the future  development of China will be determined by a struggle between the conflicting  tendencies.</p>
<h4>Crisis of Stalinism</h4>
<p>
Twenty five years ago  Marxists had correctly analysed the reasons for the crisis of Stalinism, and  predicted its collapse. Let us also recall the fact that we were the only ones  to do so. Every other tendency, from the bourgeois to the Stalinists  themselves, took for granted that the apparently monolithic regimes in Russia,  China and Eastern Europe would last almost in definitely. As late as 1988, Tony  Benn was writing articles praising &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; in Hungary. And Benn was not  less perspicacious than other reformist or bourgeois commentators.</p>
<p>
To this day, the real  causes of the crisis of Stalinism are a book closed with seven seals to the  bourgeois, reformists and ex-Stalinists, not to speak of the myriad sects on  the fringes of the labour movement. Yet they are fully explained in the  documents of the Marxists. The apologists of capital, including the reformist  labour leaders have seized on the collapse of Stalinism to attempt to  discredit the very idea of a socialist planned economy. One of our prime  responsibilities at this historic juncture is to answer these lies and  distortions.</p>
<p>
In their eagerness to  blacken the idea of socialism, the apologists of the &ldquo;free market&rdquo; conveniently  forget a few details. In 1917, there were only 10 million workers in the whole  tsarist empire, out of a total population of about 150 millions. The majority  could neither read nor write. Tsarist Russia was, in fact, far more backward  than India at the present time. Yet, within a few decades, on the basis of a  nationalised planned economy, the Soviet Union was transformed from a backward  agricultural economy into the second most powerful nation on earth, with a  mighty industrial base, with a high cultural level and more scientists than the  USA and Japan combined. Even the CIA was compelled to admit that the Soviet  space programme in the 1980s was at least ten years in advance of that of the  USA. </p>
<p>
The material conditions for  socialism did not exist in Russia in 1917, though they did exist on a world  scale. Lenin and Trotsky never envisaged the Russian Revolution as a  self-sufficient act, but as the beginning of the world socialist revolution.  But the cowardice of the Social Democratic leaders in Western Europe led to the  defeat of the revolution in Germany, Italy and other countries, and the  isolation of the Russian Revolution in conditions of appalling backwardness.  Under these conditions, the Stalinist political counterrevolution was inevitable.  The bureaucratic degeneration of the Russian Revolution did not emerge from  some theoretical flaw in Bolshevism, but from crushing backwardness.</p>
<p>
Despite the crimes of the  bureaucracy, the planned economy produced outstanding results, which transformed  the USSR into an advanced industrial nation. The material conditions were  created which would now make possible at least the beginnings of a movement in  the direction of socialism, although this process would ultimately have to be  finished on a world scale. However, the existence of a monstrous ruling caste,  the bureaucracy, not only prevented this, but effectively undermined the  planned economy itself.</p>
<p>
Only thanks to the regime  of nationalised planned economy was the USSR able to defeat Hitler&rsquo;s Germany,  with all the combined resources of Europe behind it. This result was not  anticipated by Churchill and Roosevelt, who expected Russia to be defeated in a  matter of weeks. Despite the crimes of Stalin, who beheaded the Red Army in  the Purges, the workers of the Soviet Union rallied to defend it. The Second  World War in Europe was really a titanic battle between the USSR and Nazi  Germany, with Britain and the USA mere spectators. The brilliant victory of  Russia in the War was, in itself, the most outstanding confirmation of the  superiority of a nationalised planned economy over capitalist anarchy.</p>
<p>
This is not the place to  repeat in detail the reasons for the collapse of Stalinism, which we have  explained in previous documents. The fundamental reasons were already outlined  by Trotsky. As early as 1936, he explained that a nationalised planned economy  needs democracy as the human body requires oxygen. In a relatively primitive  economy, such as that of the Soviet Union in the 1930s, confronted with the  relatively simple task of building up heavy industry, the Stalinist bu  reaucracy could get results on the basis of what is now referred to as a &ldquo;command  economy.&rdquo; The Soviet economy achieved unprecedented rates of growth, although  at a terrible cost. </p>
<p>
Even at this stage, the  rule of a privileged bureaucratic caste represented colossal waste,  mismanagement, bungling, corruption and inefficiency. Marx and Engels explained  that a socio-economic system plays an historically progressive role to the  degree that it continues to develop the productive forces. Ted Grant pointed  out a generation ago that the Stalinist bureaucracy had become transformed  from a relative to an absolute fetter on the growth of the productive forces.  As early as the mid 1960s, we published material which showed, on the basis of  official Soviet statistics, that anything between 30% and 50% of the production  of the USSR was being lost through corruption and mismanagement every year.</p>
<p>
The crisis of the  bureaucratic-totalitarian system was graphically expressed in the declining  rate of growth. In the period of the first five-year plans in the 1930s, there  was an astonishing 20% annual rate of growth, which has never been equalled by  any capitalist economy, not even Japan which occasionally reached 13% or more  in the period of the post-war upswing, but not as a sustained rate of growth.  In the same period, the USSR had an annual growth rate of 10% every year, until  the mid 1960s, when it began to slow down.</p>
<p>
Under Brezhnev, the rate of  growth fell steadily, from 10% to 6%, 5%, 1%,&hellip;0%. In the last decades, the ruling  clique tried all manner of combinations involving decentralisation,  recentralisation, re-decentralisation. To no avail. &ldquo;Theoreticians&rdquo; like Isaac  Deutscher imagined that the bureaucracy was going to reform itself out of  existence. Vain hope! The privileged ruling caste was prepared to do anything  for the working class&#8212;except get off its back! A modern economy  producing one million different commodities each year could not be organ ised properly  without the conscious control and participation of the majority of society. But  the introduction of a regime of workers&rsquo; democracy would have immediately spelt  the end of the power and privileges of the bureaucracy, which they could not  accept.</p>
<p>
A modern, sophisticated  economy, such as Russia had become by this time, is a delicate mechanism. The  precise relations between heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, science  and technique, cannot be established by arbitrary administrative fiat. In the  absence of competition, the only way to avoid colossal bungling and corruption  is through the conscious control of society, by means of the democratic  administration of the working class. Thus, for socialism, democracy is not an  optional &ldquo;extra&rdquo; but a fundamental precondition. </p>
<h4>The meaning of  Perestroika</h4>
<p>
By the late 1970s, things  had gone so far that there was a black market, not only in blue jeans and  ball-point pens, but in steel, coal and oil. This was known in the West as &ldquo;the  parallel market.&rdquo; And woe betide the manager who tried to ignore it! There was  a case reported in the Soviet press of the manager of a department store, a  model member of the Komsomol, who announced to his assembled staff on the first  day that he would not tolerate any stealing, corruption or &ldquo;blatt,&rdquo; and that  only the official state prices must be paid for deliveries. Within a week, the  store faced bankruptcy. No goods were delivered, and the shelves were empty.  The manager drew the necessary conclusion and fell into line with the accepted  practices. There were millions of such examples. Having failed to control the  problem by repression, Gorbachov made a feeble attempt to lean on the working  class to strike blows against corruption by introducing a measure of &ldquo;democracy.&rdquo;  This was the  real meaning of &ldquo;Perestroika&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glasnost.&rdquo; Gorbachov tried  to loosen the system up and make it more flexible, but without abolishing the  power and privileges of the ruling caste.</p>
<p>
When every other tendency  was praising Gorbachov as the great Saviour, we alone pointed out that his  reform was bound to fail, and characterised him as an accidental  petit-bourgeois figure, doomed to be swept away, although we thought that this  would come as a result of political revolution, and not a movement in the direction of capitalism which, at that stage, we erroneously considered to be ruled  out. The only way to solve the problem was to reintroduce a Leninist regime of  workers&rsquo; control and management, which would easily have been possible on the  basis of a developed economy that now existed in Russia. But that was the last  thing Gorbachov had in mind! Instead of improving things, Gorbachov&rsquo;s reforms  introduced a further element of destabilisation, hastening the dissolution of  the system. Only two alternatives were possible. In the absence of a movement  of the working class in the direction of a political revolution, the balance  tilted sharply in the direction of a move towards capitalism. </p>
<p>
In his famous satire Animal  Farm, George Orwell depicts the pigs and farmers in a meeting where it is impossible to distinguish one group from the other. Two generations of  bureaucratic rule produced a layer of privileged functionaries utterly divorced  from the working class and the ideas of the October Revolution. The old  Stalinist officials were corrupt gangsters, but at least had some link with the  old traditions. Here we had a new generation of aristocrats &ldquo;born in the  purple,&rdquo; used to Pierre Cardin suits and Cadillacs. Raissa Gorbachov was a  classical specimen of these creatures. In particular the elite of the  diplomatic corps got used to hobnobbing with the bourgeois, and clearly enjoyed  the experience. Shevarnadze was typical of this layer. Unlike the old crude and  ignorant bureaucrats who could not even speak a foreign language, the new layer  were educated, sleek, cosmopolitan&#8212;and with the mentality of  petit-bourgeois upstarts which is the hallmark of reformist leaders in their  dealings with the big bourgeois, where fear and envy struggle with a secret and  slavish admiration.</p>
<p>
Nowhere was the rottenness  of the bureaucracy more evident than in the period of so-called Perestroika (or  Katastroika, as the Soviet workers soon dubbed it). Gorbachov was smart enough  to realise that, unless drastic measures were taken by the leadership, the  whole thing would seize up. At this point, there is no reason to suppose that  he intended to return to capitalism. The pro-capitalist elements in the  bureaucracy were almost certainly in a minority at this time. Gorbachov&rsquo;s measures  were a typical attempt to carry out a bureaucratic reform from the top to  prevent revolution from below. Such reforms are not new in the history of  Russia, as shown by the Emancipation of the Serfs in 1861. But in every case,  the ruling elite tries to preserve its power and privileges, while loosening  the bonds of oppression to some degree. Invariably, these attempts only serve  to stoke the flames they were intended to extinguish.</p>
<p>
It was incredible how  anyone with the most elementary knowledge of Russian history, let alone  Marxism, could have entertained the slightest illusion in Gorbachov and his  policies. Yet we had so-called Marxists praising Gorbachov, and even travelling  to Moscow to witness the strange spectacle of the bureau cracy &ldquo;abolishing it  self&rdquo;! Of course, other wiseacres, like the SWP in Britain were unimpressed,  since, as far as they were concerned, capitalism already existed in Russia,  what was all the fuss about? We alone pointed out that Gorbachov could not  reform the Soviet Union, because he was acting in the interests of the  bureaucracy.</p>
<p>
As we predicted in advance,  Perestroika ended up in an impasse. Had a genuinely Leninist alternative  existed, the road would have been open for a political revolution in the Soviet  Union to restore the regime of workers&rsquo; democracy that existed in 1917. But  generations of a monstrous bureaucratic totalitarian caricature of socialism  had exercised a baneful influence on the consciousness of all classes in Soviet  society. The absence of the subjective factor was decisive. The mass  extermination of the 1930s had wiped out not only the Old Bolsheviks, but  practically any element which had had some contact with the genuine ideas of  October. In the later Purges, even large numbers of Stalinists were killed. In  this way, Stalin succeeded far more thoroughly than what could have been  anticipated in eradicating the memory of genuine Bolshevism from the  collective consciousness. In so doing, however, as Trotsky had warned, he also  undermined the basis of the conquests of the Revolution.</p>
<p>
It is an undeniable fact  that the consciousness of the Russian masses was thrown back a long way. What  has conditioned the whole situation is the fact that, so far, the proletariat  has not intervened decisively as an independent force. Of course, this will  inevitably change, perhaps sooner than many believe. But to date this has been  the determining element in the whole equation. In the absence of a mass  independent movement of the workers, the whole struggle has been fought out between  rival wings of the bureaucracy. The blind ally of Perestroika led directly to  the attempted coup of 1991. The Stalinist plotters clashed head-on with the  resistance of the nascent Russian bourgeoisie led by Yeltsin, an unscrupulous  adventurer, the former prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Gorbachov who took advantage of the coup to  promote himself as the alleged defender of &ldquo;democracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
None of the warring  factions appealed to the working class, which in the main remained in the role  of spectators. This was the situation at every major turning-point in the  situation for the past four years. The outcome of the 1991 coup was the first  such turning-point. Yeltsin succeeded temporarily in stabilising the situation  and took decisively to the road of capitalism.</p>
<h4>How much privatisation?</h4>
<p>
The different possibilities  for capitalist restoration in Russia were set forth by Trotsky in <em>The  Revolution Betrayed</em>:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;A collapse of the Soviet  regime would lead inevitably to the collapse of the planned economy, and thus  the abolition of state property. The bond of compulsion be tween the trusts  and the factories within them would fall away. The more successful enterprises  would succeed in coming out on the road of independence. They might convert  themselves into stock companies, or they might find some other transitional  form of property&#8212;one, for example, in which the workers should  participate in the profits. The collective farms would disintegrate at the same  time and far more easily. The fall of the present bureaucratic dictatorship, if  it were not replaced by a new socialist power, would thus mean a return to capitalist relations with a catastrophic decline of industry and culture.&rdquo; (Leon  Trotsky, <em>The Revolution Betrayed</em>, pp. 250-51.)</p>
<p>
What strikes one is the  brilliant way in which Trotsky anticipated the main lines of what is taking  place in Russia at the present time. Yet there are also important differences.  The class balance of forces in Russia is entirely different now. For example,  Trotsky was convinced that the peasantry would be the main social support for  capitalist restoration, whereas the opposite is the case. Here again, the  reason is that the Stalinist regime survived far longer than Trotsky thought  possible. The advances made possible by the nationalised planned economy led  to the disappearance of the peasantry altogether. The rural population of  Russia now consists almost entirely of agricultural proletarians who have no  interest in going back to small private plots of land.</p>
<p>
It is true that,  ultimately, the question of property relations must be decisive in determining  the class nature of a state. However, as we have seen, the correlation is not  always an automatic one. At decisive turning-points, the way in which a given  socio-economic formation will go is decided by a struggle between conflicting  class forces. In the process, all kinds of peculiar transitional variants are  possible which do not admit an easy appraisal precisely because of their  transitional, that is, unfinished, uncompleted character. That the process of  capitalist restoration in Russia has begun is self-evident. Indeed, it has gone  quite far. But that does not exhaust the matter. At every stage, it is  necessary to take stock of the situation. To what extent has the attempt to  move in the direction of capitalism succeeded? Under the pressure of  imperialism, the Russian government has privatised a large number of  enterprises. Nevertheless, the West remains sceptical. This scepticism is  graphically expressed in the absence of serious levels of investment from the  West.</p>
<p>
This is a hybrid formation,  with elements of a bourgeois state grafted onto the old bureaucratic apparatus.  But the old Stalinist state remains largely intact. The same old functionaries,  with the same interests, outlook and prejudices, sit in the same offices,  watching developments, some with expectations, others with growing alarm. It is  necessary to underline that this was not a worker&rsquo; state, but a hideously  deformed workers&rsquo; state&#8212;a regime of proletarian Bonapartism. After  generations of totalitarian rule, the privileged elite was completely  corrupted. A Bonapartist regime, by its very essence, rises above society and  acquires a great deal of independence.</p>
<p>
In its upper layers, the  bureaucracy reflects the pressures of the nascent bourgeoisie and, above all,  world imperialism, the lower layers that of the working class. This  contradiction is reflected in the struggle be tween the different factions of  the bureaucracy, which sometimes flares up in violent confrontations such as  the assault on the White House, and at other times remains more or less  submerged, but is visible in the rise and fall of different individuals and  groups. That is why the strategists of capital follow with such careful  attention all the twists and turns of the obscure power struggle in the  Kremlin. It is the outcome of the struggle which will determine the nature of  the state. But this cannot easily be predicted in advance. It is determined by  a multiplicity of factors, both internal and external. The way in which the  Russian state will evolve is not yet decided by history. The bourgeois wing  which has gained control of the government is striving towards restoration,  but they have not yet succeeded in carrying it out. The situation is not fixed,  but tremendously volatile. It can move in any direction.</p>
<p>
All kinds of claims are  being made concerning the degree to which privatisation has been carried out.  It is not always easy to establish the true situation. For example, it is usual  to quote the percentage of GDP represented by the &ldquo;private sector,&rdquo; but, on the  one hand, the definition of a &ldquo;private&rdquo; company is frequently unclear,  including all kinds of co-operatives and other firms that are partly or mainly  state owned, and, on the other hand, these percentages are artificially high  because of the slump of state owned industries.</p>
<p>
The most complete set of  figures on privatisation are those published by the annual Transition Report of  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which is  specifically devoted to &ldquo;measuring and defining&rdquo; the transition to a &ldquo;market  economy&rdquo; in Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU).  The latest report, published in 1995, includes detailed statistics on all the  major indices of the economies of the ex-Stalinist states up to the end of  1994. It makes highly instructive reading.</p>
<p>
The share of the private  sector of the GDP, as estimated by the EBRD in mid-1995 varies considerably,  from 70% in the Czech Republic and 65% in Estonia to 35% in the Ukraine, 30% in  Uzbekistan and Moldova, 25% in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, and a mere 15% in  Belarus, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. The figure given for the Russian Republic  is 55%, but closer scrutiny shows that this figure is misleading. In all these  states decisive sections of the economy remain in the hands of the state. On  the other hand, what passes for &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; is a very peculiar animal in  many cases. In order to prevent bankruptcy and closure, the bureaucrats of  large enterprises have combined with the workers to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; the firm, and the  very next day demand subsidies from the state to keep it open. It is not quite  clear in practice what the difference is between the situation of such firms  before and after privatisation!</p>
<p>
The EBRD report  distinguishes very carefully between real private ownership (&ldquo;pure&rdquo; private  sector) and other forms of &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; such as worker-manager buy-outs,  which they do not regard as genuinely capitalist concerns. Frequently, these  companies, though formally part of the private sector, are still heavily  enmeshed in the state, involving little or no private capital. The fact that  this is not just a detail is shown by the fact that the EBRD keeps special  tables to show the difference between the private sector and the &ldquo;non-state  sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Thus, in Russia, the &ldquo;non-state&rdquo;  sector in 1994 was estimated to account for 62% of GDP, but the real private  sector was only 25%. The figures for the Ukraine were even more  striking&#8212;the &ldquo;non-state&rdquo; sector was put at 41% in 1993, but the real  private sector amounted to a mere 7.5% (the 1995 figures were not available,  but there is no reason to suppose that the proportion would be much different).  In Belarus, where privatisation has hardly advanced at all, the percentage of  the workforce employed in the non-state sector in 1994 was put at 40.2%, but  the figure for the real private sector was only 6.2%. The situation in Latvia  was very different. Here the non-state sector is mainly composed of private  concerns: the figures of those employed in the non-state sector (58%) differed  only slightly from those in the private sector (53%).</p>
<p>
The figures for the  composition of ownership in Russia published by Earle, Estrin and Leshchenko in  1995 show that, out of 439 industrial firms chosen at random, 110 were owned by  the state, 140 were workers&rsquo; co-operatives, 40 had been taken over by the managers, and only 35 were owned by private capitalists, either Russian or foreign  (&ldquo;outsiders&rdquo;), and a further 45 were new enterprises (&ldquo;de novo&rdquo;). The state  maintained a majority share in 30% of the firms, despite privatisation. Workers  and managers hold 51% of the shares in nearly 70% of all privatised companies.  The 1995 EBRD report of privatisation in Russia, Hungary, Poland and the Czech  Republic concludes that:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The four countries  examined have adopted very different approaches to privatisation, and this has  yielded different government structures within the privatised enterprise  sector. Several tentative conclusions, largely confirmed by the evidence  presented above, can be drawn about these structures. First, state ownership,  with large insider ownership, has remained important in most countries. Second,  insider ownership, with dominant employee stakes and reportedly managerial  control is extensive in Russia, and to a lesser extent in Poland. Third,  outside ownership has emerged on a large scale in the Czech Republic, and to a  smaller scale in Hungary, but dominant foreign ownership is more common in  Hungary and this is more likely to be concentrated ownership with stronger  control rights.&rdquo; (EBRD Report,1995, p.132.)</p>
<p>
The thing to see here is  the extreme caution with which the strategists of capital approach the  situation, which they clearly characterise as a process of transition which has  not yet been completed. The picture that emerges is of a hybrid economy in  which the capitalist elements are struggling to assert themselves over the  state sector, which retains a powerful presence. The process has proceeded in an  uneven fashion, being further advanced in the Czech Republic, Hungary and, to  some extent Poland, but the situation in Russia, which is the decisive  question, is still far from being resolved in a satisfactory way from the  standpoint of international capital.</p>
<h4>Successive  approximations</h4>
<p>
There were many  turning-points on the road of the bureaucratic counterrevolution in the period  1923-36. This was by no means a preordained event. The final victory of Stalin  was not determined in advance. As a matter of fact, up till 1934, Trotsky held  the position that it was possible to reform both the Soviet state and the  Communist Parties, a position that led to frequent conflicts with the ultra  lefts. Trotsky&rsquo;s dialectical method was one of successive approximations, which  followed the process through all its stages, showing concretely the relation  between the class balance of forces in Russia, the different tendencies in the  Communist Party and their relationship to the classes, the evolution of the  world situation, the economy, and the subjective factor. It is true that he  varied his analysis at different times. For example, he initially  characterised Stalinism as &ldquo;bureaucratic centrism,&rdquo; a formula which he later  rejected in favour of the more precise &ldquo;proletarian Bonapartism.&rdquo; These changes  do not reflect any vacillations on Trotsky&rsquo;s part, but only the way in which  his analysis accurately followed the process of bureaucratic degeneration as it  unfolded.</p>
<p>
The method of our analysis  of the present events in Russia is in no way different from that of Trotsky.  There is not the slightest doubt that the movement towards capitalism in  Russia not only exists, but has gone quite far. However, from the standpoint  of Marxist analysis, this does not exhaust the problem. The question is: has  the process of capitalist restoration reached the decisive point where quantity  becomes transformed into quality? Put another way: do we consider that the new  property relations have established themselves unequivocally, in such a way  that the process is irreversible? Or, on the contrary, is it possible that the  movement towards capitalism can be reversed? Upon the answer to this question  many things hinge. It is therefore necessary to approach the question very  carefully indeed. To determine the class nature of the Russian state it is not  sufficient to refer to the percentage of the economy in private hands. It is  necessary to analyse the process as a whole, to lay bare the relation between  the different class forces involved, and show how the central contradiction is  likely to be resolved.</p>
<p>
It is possible to have a  workers&rsquo; state with 100% private ownership of the means of production, and  also to have a bourgeois state with 100% state ownership. The former was the  case with the Paris Commune. The first workers&rsquo; state in history did not even  nationalise the Bank of France, an omission which, as Marx explained, was one  of its most serious errors. Even in the first phase of the Russian Revolution,  the Bolsheviks did not proceed immediately to nationalise industry. There was  workers&rsquo; control through the Soviets, but for about 18 months most of industry  remained formally in private hands.</p>
<p>
The same contradiction  would have existed if the capitalist counterrevolution had overthrown the  Soviet power. Incidentally, this was a real possibility for a decade after  October. Only the correct policies of Lenin and Trotsky prevented it. If  Bukharin&rsquo;s position had triumphed, there could have been a capitalist restoration even in the 1920s. This fact is sufficient, on the one hand, to show how  the historical process is not at all automatic or predestined, as economic  determinists imagine, and on the other hand reveals the decisive role of the  subjective factor.</p>
<p>
To put the question more  clearly still, if Hitler had succeeded in defeating the Soviet Union, what  would have happened? The victors would have imposed a fascist regime in the  USSR, with a programme of the most savage capitalist counterrevolution. But  they could not succeed in carrying this out all at once. They would have to  proceed gradually, Trotsky predicted, beginning with agriculture, then light  industry, and finally denationalising the decisive sector of heavy industry.  Even then, it was likely that a big proportion of heavy industry would remain in  the hands of the state, which, despite this, would be a bourgeois state from  start to finish.</p>
<p>
These examples are  sufficient to demonstrate the correctness of the general proposition that, in  order to determine the class nature of a state, it is not enough merely to  publish the statistics of ownership. It is also necessary to determine the  direction in which society is moving, and, in Lenin&rsquo;s phrase, to say &ldquo;who shall  prevail?&rdquo; In our view, it is not yet possible to give a definitive answer to  these questions.</p>
<p>
Dealing with the mechanics  of a bourgeois counterrevolution in Russia, Trotsky explains:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Bourgeois society has in  the course of its history displaced many political regimes and bureaucratic  castes, without changing its social foundations. It has preserved itself  against the restoration of feudal and guild relations by the superiority of its  productive methods. The state power has been able either to co-operate with  capitalist development, or to put brakes on it. But in general the productive  forces, upon a basis of private property and competition, have been working out  their own destiny. In contrast to this, the property relations which issued  from the socialist revolution are indivisibly bound up with the new state as  their repository. The predominance of socialist over petty bourgeois tendencies  is guaranteed, not by the automatism of the economy&#8212;we are still far  from that&#8212;but by political measures taken by the dictatorship. The  character of the economy as a whole thus depends upon the character of the  state power.&rdquo; (<em>The Revolution Betrayed</em>, p. 250, our emphasis.)</p>
<p>
We have a duty to say what  the class nature of the Russian state is. But this must be approached from a  dialectical, not a formal point of view. Here too we are dealing with a process  that is not yet finished, and therefore it is impermissible to demand a  finished, once and for all definition. It is necessary to see the process as a  whole, and to determine at what point the decisive break occurs.</p>
<p>
In the historical examples  already mentioned, the answer is quite clear. When the workers of Paris smashed  the old state apparatus, they took political power into their hands and began  the task of transforming society. Had the Commune not been overthrown by the  Versaillese reaction, it would have inevitably moved to expropriate the  capitalists. The contradiction between a workers&rsquo; state and an economy in the  hands of the exploiters had to be resolved one way or another. In France it was  resolved when the bourgeois joined hand with monarchist reaction to crush the  Commune. In Russia, the Bolsheviks used state power to carry out the  expropriation of the landlords and capitalists.</p>
<p>
The same decisive break  could be seen in the opposite process. The victory of Hitler over the Soviet  Union would have been the result of a terrible military defeat. The victorious  fascists would have destroyed the old state apparatus and replaced it with a  new one which would answer to their needs. It is true that a part of the old  Stalinist bureaucracy would have collaborated, and been incorporated into the  Nazi state, but this does not alter the fact that the change would have been  accomplished by the most violent struggle imaginable. Is it possible to  maintain that a similarly decisive change has taken place now?</p>
<h4>Has a decisive change  occurred?</h4>
<p>
Up to the present, we have  characterised the situation in Russia as a transitional state, with a bourgeois  government attempting to move towards capitalism. This formulation, which is,  admittedly, rather clumsy, in our view, adequately expresses the unfinished,  contradictory, transitional nature of the stage we find ourselves in. The  essential question which has to be addressed is this: Do we consider that the  movement towards capitalism, the existence of which is not in question, has  passed the point of no return? Has quantity become transformed into quality?  Or, on the contrary, is it still unfinished, in which case it is possible that  the whole process can still be thrown into reverse? If we are of the opinion  that the bourgeois counterrevolution has definitely triumphed, then we must be  in a position to say how and when the qualitative change occurred. </p>
<p>
Just as in the 1920 and  30s, it is possible to point to a number of turning-points in the situation  that has pertained in the last period. We have, firstly, the reforms of  Gorbachov, leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Then the defeat of the coup  in 1991 and the rise of Yeltsin. After that, the crushing of the White House in  the Autumn of 1993 and the institution of Yeltsin&rsquo;s Bonapartist constitution.  Subsequently, we have the more or less rapid privatisation of a large part of  the economy. Thus, for the past six years or more, the pendulum can be  represented as moving continuously in one direction&#8212;towards capitalism.</p>
<p>
However, such a  presentation would be entirely one-sided and mechanical. Despite the temporary  inertia of the working class, it would be foolish not to see the existence of  enormous tensions at all levels of Russian society. This was sharply revealed  in the bloody storming of the White House. The complete bankruptcy of the  former Stalinists of the &ldquo;hard-line&rdquo; faction of Khasbulatov and Rutskoi was  shown by their inability to appeal to the working class. However, the victory  of Yeltsin (which came as a surprise to himself) did not lead to stabilisation  on a capitalist basis. On the contrary. In the following months, the faction of  bourgeois reformers have suffered one setback after another.</p>
<p>
When we say that there is a  movement in the direction of capitalism, that directly establishes the  transitional nature of the phenomenon. And it is not at all sure how this  particular transition will end. At this moment of writing, we see no reason to  modify our earlier position. On the contrary. Recent events have only served  to underline the difficulties in the path of capitalist restoration in Russia,  and the powerful countervailing tendencies that exist.</p>
<p>
Here we can learn a lesson  from the class enemy. If the process of capitalist restoration in Russia has  already been successfully concluded, it is hard to explain the extraordinarily  cautious attitude of Western investors in relation to the Russian market. This  was aptly summed up in a recent analysis for investors which bore the significant  title: Russia&#8212;a Sinking Ship, dated 30th of January 1995. This  memorandum to the multinationals draws the following conclusions: &ldquo;We expect  Russia to maintain the pretence of reform, and the West to pretend to support  them.&rdquo; And it goes on: &ldquo;The Russian reform ship is sinking, and along with it  any short-term confidence in its financial assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The same document explains  that, despite extensive privatisation plans &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not much left that&rsquo;s  really attractive to own.&rdquo; Answering Yeltsin&rsquo;s assertion that, after the  Chechen war, there would be &ldquo;business as usual,&rdquo; it states flatly: &ldquo;Nothing  could be further from the truth.&rdquo; The invasion of Chechnya, it says,  represented &ldquo;a triumph for the more hard-line elements in the Kremlin.&rdquo; It  points out that a number of people actually opposed to privatisation have been  given jobs in the Ministry of Privatisation. One Minister, Polevanov, had to be  removed following a speech suggesting the renationalisation of strategic  industries in Russia. It concludes:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The real lesson of  Chechnya is that, despite the adoption of a new constitution and the  incorporation of many &lsquo;technocrats&rsquo; in Russia&rsquo;s government, the old bureaucracy  of the former Soviet Union continue to rule the state in the same secretive way  as before, and with the same instincts. Whenever confronted by a seemingly  intractable problem, Yeltsin opts for force, rather than compromise. That leads  to wild swings between reform and repression, without any of the predictability  so necessary for any long-term, durable change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Despite all the public show  of support for Yeltsin, the Western leaders are well aware of the real  situation. The fact that they are obliged to cling to this ailing and drunken  buffoon is itself an eloquent comment on the extremely tenuous nature of the  reform in Russia. From the standpoint of imperialism, any of the other options  would be still worse. Five years of &ldquo;market reform&rdquo; have alienated the  reformers from the mass of the population. Gaidar and Fyodorov find themselves  in opposition. In order to stay in power, Yeltsin has been forced to rely on  the support of the so-called &ldquo;hard-liners.&rdquo; </p>
<p>
The international  strategists of capital are anxiously following every twist and turn in the  policy of Yeltsin and the other factions of the bureaucracy. For what reason?  They understand that in the rise and fall of different parties, individuals and  groups is reflected shifts in the mood of different classes in society which  find a distorted expression in the conflicts within the bureaucracy. In the  absence of an open struggle for power between the proletariat and the nascent  bourgeoisie, the process takes place in a confused and caricatured form.  Nevertheless the conflicts exist and are carefully monitored by the  imperialists, who are extremely interested in the outcome.</p>
<p>
The December election was  only the most graphic manifestation of a general shift in Russian society  against privatisation. This is not an abstract question, but a very concrete  one. Not only the working class is drawing a balance sheet of privatisation,  but the bureaucracy also. One section has succeeded in enriching itself, but by  no means all of them share the enthusiasm of Chernomyrdin and Chubais. Without  doubt, the lower strata of the bureaucracy closely reflect the mood of the  workers. But even in the upper layers, doubts about the benefits of the &ldquo;market&rdquo;  are gathering force. This is clearest in the case of the officer caste, but  also of an important layer of the managerial wing of the bureaucracy, whose  factories are faced with bankruptcy.</p>
<p>
On the 5th of February, the  Financial Times carried an article with the title &ldquo;Red barons try to roll back  privatisation,&rdquo; which deals with this phenomenon. It points out that  privatisation has harmed the position of this layer of the bureaucracy, which  finds its interests threatened by the upstart nascent capitalists:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Russia&rsquo;s bold mass  privatisation programme,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;weakened many of Russia&rsquo;s stolid Soviet-era  factory directors and transferred control of their enterprises to a flashy new  breed of Moscow financiers. But, following the communist triumph in December&rsquo;s  parliamentary elections and the sacking of prominent reformers from the  government, the rump of old-style red directors have mounted a spirited  campaign to roll back the tide.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;This national trend has  been highlighted by the recent efforts of the old managers of two of Russia&rsquo;s  flagship companies to wrest control from the private en trepreneurs who  acquired big stakes in them through the country&rsquo;s privatisation programme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The article goes on to  detail the attempt of the manager of Norilsk Nikel, the world&rsquo;s biggest nickel  producer, and one of Russia&rsquo;s most valuable companies, to regain control, and  also the &ldquo;coup&rdquo; in which the old managers of the Zil car plant ousted the  directors put in place by Microdean, a newly-established capitalist holding company. The Financial Times comments:</p>
<p>
&ldquo;These battles are being  watched closely by Russia&rsquo;s political and business leaders, because they are  part of a broader effort to reverse at least partially the bold privatisation  programme which has transferred 80% of the Russian economy into private hands.&rdquo;  The figure of 80% is an exaggeration, as we shall shortly show. But the main  point is the way in which the serious representatives of capital analyse the  processes, bringing out very clearly the contradictory tendencies:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The growing momentum  behind efforts to roll back privatisation suggests that western fears that Mr.  Gennady Zyuganov&rsquo;s Communist party may be some what misplaced: the challenge to  Russian market reforms comes not only from the communists but also from the  hard-line faction which is increasingly power ful within Mr. Boris Yeltsin&rsquo;s  Kremlin.</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The campaign for what  Russian coyly describe as &lsquo;de-privatisation&rsquo; has already enlisted a number of  high-level supporters,&rdquo; the article adds, naming Yuri Luzhkov, the influential  mayor of Moscow whose relations with Yeltsin appear to have improved to the  degree that the President has grasped the need to distance himself from the &ldquo;reformers&rdquo;  in order to save his skin. With Yeltsin&rsquo;s not so tacit backing, Luzhkov has  even gone so far as to call for Anatoly Chubais, the recently sacked former  Minister of Privatisation to be put on trial, thus confirming the well-known  adage that there is no gratitude in politics!</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Chubais may have not had  any malicious intent,&rdquo; acknowledges Luzhkov gracefully, before sticking the  knife in, &ldquo;but, nonetheless, the prosecutor&rsquo;s office should consider his  performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
More serious still, a  special committee has been formed by the Russian parliament to review the  legality of privatisation. &ldquo;The first casualty of the committee is likely to be  last autumn&rsquo;s hasty and controversial shares-for-loan privatisation programme,  already ruled invalid by the Minister of Justice,&rdquo; says the Financial Times,  and concludes:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;For western investors and  Russia&rsquo;s bourgeoisie, these challenges to privatisation are one of the biggest  threats since the collapse of communism. The conflict cannot be reduced to a  simple free market forces and neo-communists.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Even leading Russian  reformers admit that, in many instances, the red directors have a moral and  legal point because of the corrupt and uncompetitive way much of Russia&rsquo;s state  property was transferred to private hands. But the messy character of Russia&rsquo;s  privatisation process means once de-privatisation begins it will be very  difficult for courts and investors to determine where it ends.&rdquo; (Our  emphasis.)</p>
<h4>Is the Russian  bourgeoisie progressive?</h4>
<p>
Socialism means that the  development of industry, technique, science and culture stand on a higher level  than the most developed capitalist society. In that case, there is no question  of society reverting to a more backward system such as commodity production.  Such elements of small commodity production that remained would gradually  disappear and be replaced by superior socialist forms. Compulsion would not be  necessary, to the degree that the small farmers and businessmen see for  themselves the immense advantages of the new economic formations.</p>
<p>
This picture of a workers&rsquo;  state is correct, but it is only an abstraction. The workers&rsquo; state that was established in Russia in 1917 was not on a higher economic level than Britain and  the USA, but on a very primitive basis. Under the circumstances, the specific  weight of the bourgeois and petit-bourgeois elements was enormous. As long as  the working class, represented by the Bolsheviks, maintained control of the  state, the pressure of the bourgeois nepmen and their al lies, the wealthy  peasants (&ldquo;kulaks&rdquo;) could be kept at bay. Nevertheless, the danger of  capitalist restoration was very real, as Lenin and Trotsky repeatedly warned.  By the end of the Civil War, the process of social polarisation began to create  an alarming situation: </p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The peasantry,&rdquo; wrote  Trotsky, &ldquo;was becoming polarised between the small capitalist on the one hand  and the hired hand on the other. At the same hand, lacking industrial  commodities, the state was crowded out of the rural market. Between the kulak  and the petty home craftsman there appeared, as though from under the earth,  the middleman. The state enterprises themselves, in search of raw material,  were more and more compelled to deal with the private trader. The rising tide  of capitalism was visible everywhere. Thinking people saw plainly that a  revolution in the forms of property does not solve the problem of socialism,  but only raises it.&rdquo; (<em>The Revolution Betrayed</em>, p.26.)</p>
<p>
Lenin had warned many times  of the danger that the petit-bourgeois masses in Russia could link up with  foreign capital, creating a formidable restorationist block. That is why he and  Trotsky fought implacably in defence of the state monopoly of foreign trade  which Stalin and Bukharin originally wanted to abolish. The victory of the  Stalin faction over Bukharin&rsquo;s Right Opposition signified the defeat of the  bourgeois restorationist trend, but did not remove the danger. </p>
<p>
The conflict between the  nationalised property forms established by October and the nascent bourgeoisie  at that time was solved in favour of the former. The decisive section of the  Stalinist bureaucracy, in order to defend its power and privileges, leaned on  the support of the working class to crush the kulaks and nepmen. But, under  the given conditions, this did not mean the restoration of a regime of workers&rsquo;  democracy, but, on the contrary, the consolidation of a bureaucratic  totalitarian state.</p>
<p>
The defeat of the nascent  bourgeois elements was achieved by the most monstrous Bonapartist means, such  as the madness of forced collectivisation which alienated the peasants and  disorganised Soviet agriculture for generations. Stalin imagined that it was  possible to eliminate the danger of capitalist restoration by administrative  means and naked force. This was an illusion. The real danger to the  nationalised planned economy came from the extremely low level of the productive forces, low labour productivity and general poverty and, above all, from  imperialist encirclement, where the main enemies of the Soviet Union enjoyed a  higher level of economic development, despite the crisis of world capitalism.</p>
<p>
Within the edifice of  bureaucratic planning, the &ldquo;nepman&rdquo; elements had not disappeared, but worked in  a disguised way. In the absence of workers&rsquo; control and administration of  industry, society and the state, to repeat Marx&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;all the old crap&rdquo;  revived. The dual nature of the transitional state, in which elements of  socialist planned economy coexisted with bourgeois norms of distribution,  inequality and corruption, acted as a fertile breeding ground for all kinds of  swindling and theft which, even at the time of the First Five Year Plan,  swallowed up a large and growing part of the surplus produced by the working  class.</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Capital comes initially  from circulation,&rdquo; writes Marx, &ldquo;and, moreover, its point of departure is  money.&rdquo; (Marx, <em>Grundrisse</em>, p. 253.) Marx explains that capitalism, in its most  primitive and underdeveloped forms, usurers&rsquo; and merchant capital, makes an  appearance long before the objective conditions for the establishment of the  capitalist mode of production have arisen. In pre-capitalist societies,  however, the phenomena related to merchant capital do not play a productive  role.</p>
<p>
When society had not yet  reached the level when commodity production was possible as the norm, trading  peoples like the Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Jews appeared at the margins of  the economy, appropriating the surplus produced by other, less developed  peoples through exchange. In the ancient world, these activities were closely  identified with cheating, robbery, kidnapping and piracy. They arose in the &ldquo;interstices&rdquo;  of society, where they acted as a disintegrating influence on the existing  socio-economic order. In the ancient world, whenever it got a hold, merchant  capital hastened the dissolution of the old gens society and inevitably led to  slavery. Later on, in the Middle Ages, usury and merchant capital played a  similar role in undermining feudalism:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;With semi-barbarian or  completely barbarian peoples, there is at first interposition by trading  peoples, or else tribes whose production is different by nature enter into  contact and exchange their superfluous products. The former case is a more  classical form. Let us therefore dwell on it. The exchange of the overflow is a  traffic which posits exchange and exchange value. But it extends only to the  overflow and plays an accessory role to production itself. But if the trading  peoples who solicit exchange appear repeatedly (the Lombards, Normans etc.  play this role towards nearly all European peoples), and if an ongoing commerce  develops, although the producing people still engages only in so-called passive  trade, since the impulse for the activity of positing exchange values comes  from the outside and not from the inner structure of its production, then the  surplus of production must no longer be something accidental, occasionally  present, but must be constantly repeated, and in this way domestic production  itself takes on a tendency towards circulation, towards the positing of  exchange values.&rdquo; (Marx, <em>Grundrisse</em>, p.256.)</p>
<p>
And he further developed  this idea in the third volume of <em>Capital</em>: </p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The development of  commerce and merchant&rsquo;s capital gives rise everywhere to the tendency towards  production of exchange-values, increases its volume, multiplies it, makes it  cosmopolitan, and develops money into world-money. Commerce, therefore, has a  more or less dissolving influence everywhere on the producing organisation,  which it finds at hand and whose different forms are mainly carried on with a  view to use-value. To what extent it brings about a dissolution of the old mode  of production depends on its solidity and internal structure. And whither this  process of dissolution will lead, in other words, what new mode of production  will replace the old, does not depend on commerce, but on the character of the  old mode of production itself. In the ancient world the effect of commerce and  the development of merchant&rsquo;s capital always resulted in a slave economy;  depending on the point of departure, only in the transformation of a  patriarchal slave system devoted to the production of immediate means of  subsistence into one devoted to the production of surplus-value. However, in  the modern world, it results in the capitalist mode of production. It follows  therefrom that these results spring in themselves from circumstances other than  the development of merchant&rsquo;s capital.&rdquo; (Marx, <em>Capital</em>, Vol. III, pp.326-7, our  emphasis.)</p>
<p>
Marx describes the Jews  existing &ldquo;in the pores of Polish society,&rdquo; in the sense that they were not part  of the existing feudal mode of production, but acted as middle men, buying and  selling, and lending money to the nobility and peasants. In the Middle Ages,  usurers&rsquo; capital remained as an unproductive hoard. Thus, capital appears first  on the stage of history as an unproductive phenomenon which does not arise out  of the existing mode of production, but penetrates it from without and  gradually undermines it. The degree to which it succeeds in this depends on the  solidity of the existing order. In the early stages of feudalism, to the degree  that usurers&rsquo; and merchant capital existed, it could not lead to the dissolution of an economic system which was still developing the means of  production. But at a later stage, in the epoch of feudal decay, these elements  played a central role in hastening the collapse of the existing society.</p>
<p>
Feudalism was essentially  based on the production of use-values, not commodities. There was no need for  self-sufficient feudal estates to trade with each other. Primitive forms of  capitalism (merchant and usurers&rsquo; capital) insinuated themselves in the &ldquo;pores&rdquo;  of the feudal economy, fulfilling an important role in relation to trade. The  Jews fulfilled a need in the general economy that could not be fulfil by anyone  else&#8212;as professional traders. Moreover, Marx explains how in  underdeveloped societies &ldquo;commercial profit does not only assume the shape of  outbargaining and cheating, but also arises largely from these methods.&rdquo;  (<em>Capital</em>, Vol. III, p.386.)</p>
<h4>Primitive accumulation</h4>
<p>
At this stage in its  development, capital does not create any wealth, but acts as a  mediator&#8212;a &ldquo;middleman&rdquo;&#8212;playing a role in circulation  which can not be played by the existing system of production. In the Soviet  Union, the system of bureaucratic planning created numerous bottlenecks which  had an increasingly paralysing effect upon circulation. This was one of the  main brakes on the economy, which would have ground to a halt had it not been  for the corrupt and illegal practices known as blatt, which circumvented the  official channels, thus permitting goods to circulate more  rapidly&#8212;at a price. This phenomenon existed from the earliest period  of the Five Year Plans, as Victor Serge points out:</p>

&ldquo;We now come to the unique  domain of blatt, a Russian slang term which signifies &lsquo;combination.&rsquo; From the  bottom of economic life to its summit the combination reigns. Heads of trusts,  directors of banks or of plants, administrators of State commerce,  administrators of kolkhozes or of artels, store managers, employees&#8212;all resort to it everyday. All the wheels of the colossal  machine are oiled and fouled by it. Its role is as great as that of planning,  because without it the plan would never be realised. The combination of a  multitude of departments makes up for the insufficiency of wages, for the  defects in statistics, for administrative negligence, for bureaucratic  unintelligence; it piles miracle upon miracle. A shoe-factory director  receives, in accordance with the plan, a permit for a ton of leather to be  taken from the neighbouring tannery in February. The tannery, even though it  conforms with the directives, answers that it finds it impossible to deliver these  raw materials before March. The production plan of the shoe factory is going up  in smoke; but our director is not upset by it. He expected that. &lsquo;Look here,  old man,&rsquo; he will say to his colleague from the tannery, &lsquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t pull a  trick like that on me, would you?&rsquo; &lsquo;Certainly not, we only need to get together  on it. Service for service, eh? The tanners are lacking shoes, dear comrade;  couldn&rsquo;t you have five hundred pairs for me within the fortnight?&rsquo; In the end,  the tanners will be shod&#8212;not so well, to be sure, as their factory  director and his family, whose boots the whole town will admire; and the shoe  plant will execute its plan, which will bring its directors premiums, a  banquet, etcetera. It will be clearly perceived, when the problem of  transporting the raw materials from one plant to the other arises, that there  are neither cars nor trucks available, for entirely peremptory reasons; but  here again the beneficent combination will intervene. Railway men and  lorry-drivers will find that it pays.&rdquo; (Victor Serge, <em>Destiny of a Revolution</em>,  pp.43-4.)</p>
<p>
The phenomenon described  here bears a striking similarity to the activities of the parasitic middle men  in pre-capitalist society. It does not flow from the nationalised planned  economy, but from the isolation of the Revolution in conditions of appalling  backwardness and the bureaucratic regime that arose from the loss of political  power by the working class. These elements&#8212;&rdquo;blatt,&rdquo; corruption,  swindling, black marketeering&#8212;far from dying away, actually grew  with the development of the Soviet economy, absorbing an ever increasing amount  of the surplus and cancelling out the gains of the planned economy. In the same  way that usury and merchant capital dissolved and undermined pre-capitalist  society from within, so the alien bureaucracy, that &ldquo;parasitic excrescence on  the planned economy&rdquo; gradually undermined the system. In just the same way, a  parasite can eat away and eventually kill the host animal upon which it feeds.</p>
<p>
These illegal practices  were identified with a large and growing underworld of crooks, spivs and  speculators which existed in the &ldquo;pores&rdquo; of Soviet society. Just as the Jewish  middlemen existed in the &ldquo;pores&rdquo; of Polish feudalism. They were not part of the  nationalised planned economy and did not arise from it, but represented a  cancerous tumour and a parasitic excrescence on it. This was a graphic  expression of the glaring contradiction between the needs of the nationalised  planned economy and the suffocating grasp of bureaucratic control. The Soviet  middlemen, the embryonic expression of the nascent bourgeoisie, played no role  in production, but became necessary to &ldquo;oil&rdquo; the works which were increasingly  disrupted by bureaucratic bungling, sabotage and red tape.</p>
<p>
In return for this &ldquo;service,&rdquo;  the middlemen extracted a high and increasing tribute from society in the form  of swindling, cheating and robbery which absorbed an ever growing part of the  surplus value. Here, from the beginning, there were two contradictory but  mutually inseparable elements: on the one hand, the bureaucracy which held  political power and controlled the state, on the other hand, a large number of  actual criminals, black marketeers, spivs and speculators who competed with  them for a slice of the surplus value. The bureaucracy for a long time tried to  keep these elements under control by administrative means, fearful that this  unbridled looting of the state could undermine the whole system of planned  economy, and with it, their own privileged position. Hence, we had the  contradiction of the introduction of the death penalty for &ldquo;economic crimes&rdquo; at  a time when the USSR was said to be &ldquo;building Communism.&rdquo; But no amount of  arrests, imprisonment and shooting could eradicate a disease which was the inevitable result of a corrupt totalitarian regime. After all, it was only the  difference between &ldquo;legal&rdquo; and illegal theft!</p>
<p>
Here we have a phenomenon  which closely parallels the historical process of the primitive accumulation of  capital described by Marx in precapitalist societies. But there is a  difference. The capital accumulated in the Middle Ages by the merchants and  usurers was originally unproductive. Derived, as Marx explains, from cheating  and &ldquo;outbargaining&rdquo; outside the productive process, it ended up as an  unproductive usurer&rsquo;s hoard. However, with the rise of capitalism in the 15th  and 16th centuries, the usurer&rsquo;s hoard formed the basis for the process of  capitalist accumulation proper, first as mercantile capital, and at a later  stage as industrial capital. This was the period of capitalist ascent, when the  bourgeoisie on a world scale played a progressive role in the development of  the productive forces.</p>
<p>
Without doubt, the cheating  and plundering of the nationalised economy by the hordes of &ldquo;Soviet&rdquo; crooks and  speculators played a similar role to the activities of the middlemen under  feudalism. But this is not the 16th century, but the epoch of imperialist  decay. On a world scale, capitalism no longer finds itself in a period of  general historical advance but, on the contrary, in a period of downswing in  which booms have an increasingly sickly and unstable character, and recessions  are increasingly prolonged and severe. This is the decisive factor in the  equation when we consider the prospects for capitalist restoration in Russia.</p>
<p>
Can it be assumed that the  elements of primitive accumulation in Russia will play the same role in  developing the productive forces as did usurer&rsquo;s and merchant capital in the  period of capitalist ascent? Experience speaks against such a possibility.  Russian capitalism has revealed itself from the outset as corrupt and  degenerate. It is Mafia capitalism, and continues to operate as such. Its main  concern is not the development of the productive forces, but robbery, swindling  and cheating. Its methods include kidnapping, murder and extortion. The Russian  Mafia-bourgeoisie imposes a 20% &ldquo;tribute&rdquo; on everyone&#8212;from foreign  investors to poor old women selling a few pathetic possessions outside the  metro. Its conception of free competition includes the systematic murder of  business rivals. Along this road lies not progress, but only barbarism.</p>
<p>
It is futile to complain,  as Western commentators frequently do, that what is required is not this  capitalism, but some kind of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; capitalism, healthy, progressive and  democratic. Such a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; capitalism has never existed. Indeed, the search  for social &ldquo;norms&rdquo; is in general a waste of time. Social phenomena must be  analysed concretely, as they arise in a given historical context. Just as it is  impossible to understand the monstrous deformed workers&rsquo; state of Stalinism on  the basis of the abstract norm of a &ldquo;workers&rsquo; state&rdquo; in general, so it is  impossible to shed light on what is now happening in Russia by referring to the  texts of Adam Smith and Ricardo.</p>
<p>
Both Stalinism and Mafia  capitalism are products of concrete historical conditions nationally and internationally. The deformed workers&rsquo; state was an expression of the historical  backwardness of Russia and the isolation of the revolution. Mafia capitalism is  an expression of the fact that the Russian bourgeoisie has arrived too late to  play a progressive role, and that, on a world scale, the capitalist system has  exhausted itself.</p>
<h4>The economy is decisive</h4>
<p>
Marxism explains that the  key to historical development in general is ultimately determined by the  development of the productive forces: of the growth of industry, agriculture,  science and technique, of the productivity of labour. The collapse of Stalinism  was the direct result of the fact that the bureaucracy, at a certain point  became transformed from a relative brake on the development of the productive  forces to an absolute barrier. By the 1980s, the USSR was no longer achieving  higher rates of growth than the advanced capitalist countries. This was a  sentence of death. However, the question of the dynamics of growth has a  relative character. The Soviet economy was slowing down relative to the West,  which was experiencing a temporary period of boom in 1982-90. This was a  decisive element in the situation. The position could have been entirely different if capitalism had been in the throes of a depression as in the 1930s, when  the Soviet economy was advancing at a rate of 20% a year.</p>
<p>
No less than a workers&rsquo;  state, a bourgeois regime will stand or fall on its ability to carry society  forward. The victory of capitalism over feudalism was guaranteed by the higher  productivity of labour, and the development of the economy. From a Marxist  point of view, this alone is what defines a given regime as historically  progressive or otherwise. The viability of a capitalist regime in Russia  depends, ultimately, on its ability to develop the means of production. This,  in turn, is directly linked to the general perspectives for the world economy.  Under conditions of capitalist downswing, where the main economies are only  capable of achieving a growth rate of 1-3% in booms, as against 5-6% in the  period of upswing, the outlook for Russia is not encouraging.</p>
<p>
Under such conditions, the  attempt to move towards capitalism will inevitably be accompanied with new  social and economic convulsions. The immediate prospect is for a wave of  factory closures and mass unemployment, as the big state firms are allowed to  go bankrupt. The accumulation of capital under such conditions presupposes the  driving down of wages to below their value, with a further fall in living  standards and consumption for the majority, thus creating new and insoluble  contradictions. The narrowness of the internal market would have to be  compensated for by a fierce drive to export. But the traditional markets for  Russian goods in Eastern Europe are increasingly being diverted to the West.  Most Russian goods can compete with Western imports neither in price nor  quality. On the other hand, the markets of Western Europe are virtually closed  to them.</p>
<p>
For these reasons, from the outset, a capitalist regime in Russia would  necessarily have an aggressive imperialist character, seeking to recover its  old spheres of influences in the former territory of the USSR, Eastern Europe,  the Balkans and Asia. With a large industrial base and a powerful army, such a  state would not be a comfortable neighbour. Internally, a Russian capitalist  regime could only be a monstrously corrupt and oppressive police state. In its  external relations, it would be an aggressive imperialist state, constantly  seeking to destabilise and interfere in the affairs of its neighbours&#8212;just like tsarist Russia, but with a far more powerful base.  This would add a further element of instability to the world situation.</p>
<p>
The strategists of capital are far from convinced that the transition to  capitalism has been successfully completed. They understand full well that the  situation in Russia is extremely unstable and potentially explosive. It is a  struggle of living class forces, in which the working class has yet to  pronounce its first word, let alone the last. In the last analysis, the  viability of any socio-economic regime is determined by its ability to develop  the productive forces The balance sheet of the first five years of &ldquo;market  reform&rdquo; are a striking confirmation of Trotsky&rsquo;s prediction that a movement  towards capitalism in Russia would signify an unprecedented economic and  cultural collapse. The same Western observers who exaggerated every defect of  the Soviet economy, and deliberately suppressed all its successes (a game they  have been playing even more obsessively in the last period) remain stubbornly  silent about the glorious achievements of the &ldquo;market&rdquo; in the last period. But,  whichever way you look at it, the balance sheet is disastrous.</p>
<p>
In particular, the collapse in Russia resembles the effects of a  catastrophic defeat in war, or, more correctly, in two wars. Not since the Dark  Ages after the collapse of the Roman Empire has Europe seen such an economic  catastrophe in peacetime. If we take the real GDP of Russia in 1989 as 100, the  figure for 1994 was 49%. That means a drop of more than half in five years. If  we remember that the fall in the USA in the period 1929-31 was 30%, it is  possible to get an approximate idea of the unprecedented nature of the  collapse. Nor is Russia the worst case. In the same period, the economy of  Kazakhstan had a negative growth of 56%; Ukraine, 57%; Moldova, 58%;  Tajikistan, 60%; Armenia, 63%; Azerbaijan, 65%; and Georgia, an astonishing  83%. </p>
<p>
When we turn to the figures for share of industry in GDP in 1993, as  compared to 1989, the unprecedented collapse of the productive forces in this  period emerges with full force. The collapse of the manufacturing base in this  period is revealed in the statistics for the share of industry in the GDP.  Industry&rsquo;s share in the economy fell by 26.4% in Albania, 22.5% in Armenia,  23.5% in Bulgaria, 21.3% in Georgia, 19.4% in Poland and 11,1% in Russia. There  was an increase in the parasitic &ldquo;service&rdquo; sector in most of these countries  (but even that fell by 10% in the Ukraine, 12.7% in Georgia and 25.4% in  Armenia). The big increase in the share of agriculture in Armenia, and to some  extent the Ukraine, can only be explained by a partial return of sections of  the population to subsistence farming in conditions of general economic  collapse.</p>
<p>
The figures for investment tell the same story. Only in one case (Slovenia,  which started from a low base) has the level of gross domestic investment  recovered the levels of 1989. Bulgaria, Latvia and Lithuania fell by more than  half. Poland, Belarus, Georgia and Uzbekistan by one third. If we further  examine the breakdown of what investment there is, the parasitic nature of the  nascent bourgeoisie immediately becomes evident. The share of the private  sector in total investment is extremely small in every case. The state still  provides the lion&rsquo;s share. This is true even in the Czech Republic, where  state-sector invested three times as much as the private sector in 1993, the  last year for which the figures are given. In Lithuania and Estonia the figures  for private investment were 1.3% and 1.6% of GDP respectively. In Russia,  private investment was less than one percent of GDP, while the state sector  amounted to 24.9%.</p>
<p>
The hope of the pro-bourgeois elements that they would be bailed out by  foreign investment has not been fulfilled. With the exception of the Czech  Republic, Hungary, and, to some extent, Poland, there has been next to no  foreign investment in these economies. The total foreign investment in the  Russian Republic, with a population of 160 millions is almost the same as  Poland, with 38 millions. On a per capita basis, this is equivalent to the  grand total of eleven dollars for every Russian man and woman. Total foreign  direct investment (FDI) in Russia between 1989 and 1994 was a derisory $1.6  billion. In the same period, China received $82.5 billion.</p>
<p>
What these figures mean is that Western investors are not investing in  Russia, because they have no confidence in the future. True, these figures do  not include such things as aid from Western governments and loans from the IMF  and World Bank, which also do not add up to much. Nevertheless, Russia is increasingly dependent on handouts from the West&#8212;a very fragile base on  which to proceed, since this &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; is made on the basis of political  expediency and the short term political calculations of the imperialists, which  can change at any time. At the present time the IMF  is clearly turning a blind eye to the manifest failure off the Russian economy  to meet its criteria, in order not to embarrass their man, Yeltsin in the run  up to the Presidential election. But this policy of writing off the debts of  the Moscow government cannot last forever, and is already causing a rift inside  the IMF. One sector is opposed to making more concessions, and wants to apply  further pressure to force Yeltsin to speed up &ldquo;market reform&rdquo; regardless of the  social consequences, another wing is becoming alarmed at the threat of social  upheavals which can destroy the &ldquo;reform&rdquo; altogether. At the moment, the latter  tendency has the upper hand. It is not clear for how long.</p>
<p>
Economic output in Russia  continued to fall last year. In the first 11 months of 1995, production fell by  a further 4%. Real wages, supposed to have &ldquo;stabilised&rdquo; last year, fell by  15%. Unemployment doubled. As for the alleged &ldquo;victory over inflation,&rdquo; the  slower increase of prices is only the other side of the coin of the collapse of  production. Even so, yearly in flation still stands officially at 150%, which  in any normal capitalist economy, would be seen as a disaster. However, no  economy can continue to fall indefinitely. At a certain point, some kind of  unstable equilibrium must be reached. The government hopes that the economy  will stabilise this year, and even grow by 10%. It is ruled out that they could  reach such a figure. 2% would be a more realistic figure. In any case, the  hoped for growth must be set against the terrible drop in the previous period.</p>
<p>
The economic projections of  the reformers are hardly reliable. In 1994, less than half the taxes projected  were actually collected. The Mafia are not the most punctual of taxpayers. On  the other hand, the level of inter-enterprise debts is staggering. No wonder  the multinationals are not keen to invest in Russia! Their real attitude is  shown by the constant fall of the ruble. The 1995 state budget was based on an  average rate of 3,800 rubles to the dollar (in itself, a catastrophic fall),  but this level was already overtaken on the 13th of January. The present rate  of exchange is about 5,000 rubles to the dollar.</p>
<h4>Living standards</h4>
<p>
The economic crisis has  been accompanied by a frightful collapse in living standards. During the period  of &ldquo;reform,&rdquo; real wages in Russia fell by half. A large proportion of the  population lives in conditions of poverty not seen since the War. Millions face  malnutrition, if not actual hunger. According to the (probably optimistic)  calculations of the World Bank, one third of the population is living below the  official poverty line. This is defined as lacking the minimum of low quality  foodstuffs needed to survive &ldquo;over a certain period of time.&rdquo; Wages are not  paid for months on end as a result of the huge debts accumulated by state-owned  enter prises and the collapse of the central plan. The present life expectancy  of a male Russian is 57 years, about the same as Pakistan. Disease, suicide,  murder, inadequate food, despair, have combined with the demolition of the  health service to reduce Russia to third world levels of health. Diseases like  cholera and diphtheria, which were believed to belong to the past, have  reappeared.</p>
<p>
The reactionary face of the  pro-bourgeois regime is graphically revealed in the position of  women&#8212;always a faithful barometer of the level of real social  progress. The October revolution laid the basis for the social emancipation of women,  and although the Stalinist political counterrevolution represented a partial  setback, it is undeniable that women in the Soviet Union made colossal strides  in the struggle for equality. The movement toward capitalism has rapidly  reversed the gains of the past, pushing women back to a position of abject  slavery in the hypocritical name of the &ldquo;Family.&rdquo; In the Soviet Union, 90% of  women worked&#8212;the prior condition of social, economic and  psychological emancipation. Now the biggest part of the burden of the crisis  is being put on the shoulders of the women. 70% of the unemployed in Russia are  women. In some areas the figure is 90%. Under the old regime, women received  70% of men&rsquo;s wages. The figure is now 40%. Women are the first to be sacked, in  order to avoid paying social benefits like child and maternity benefit. The  Minister of Labour of the Russian Federation was quoted in <em>The Economist</em>  (12/8/95) as saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better that men work and women take care of the  children and do the housework.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Thus, women are the main  victims of this reactionary regime. Thrust back into the dark recesses of the  family, they are made to pay a terrible price for the liquidation of the social  gains of October. In 1993 14000 Russian women were murdered by their husbands  or boyfriends&#8212;a figure twenty times more than in the USA.</p>
<p>
Prostitution has acquired a  massive character, as women try to survive by selling their bodies to those  with money to buy them&#8212;mainly the despicable &ldquo;new rich&rdquo; and  foreigners. Even here they fall prey to the Mafia which demands at least 20% of  all businesses. Even individuals who struggle to earn a few rubles selling some  pitiful possessions in the street are forced to pay tribute.</p>
<p>
The desperate position of  the masses contrasts with the ostentatious wealth of the nascent bourgeoisie  and its hangers-on. The fleets of cream-coloured Mercedes, the glittering  boutiques selling $2,000 dresses stand in in sulting contrast to the majority  struggling to survive. The consequences of this are not lost on the more intelligent Western observers:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The growing distance  between rich and poor,&rdquo; writes the <em>Financial Times</em> (10/4/95), &ldquo;is also more  shocking to Russian eyes than to western ones because it has replaced a  communist order in which the currency of social status was a political power  rather than money and the elites were careful to mask their privileges with  paeans to the virtues of the working class.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;For these reasons, the  increasingly deep divide between the winners and losers created over the past  three years by Russia&rsquo;s traumatic economic and political transformation is  emerging as the most important underlying factor in the country&rsquo;s struggle to  determine how to move forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The experience of the  delights of the &ldquo;market economy&rdquo; is having its effect on the consciousness of  the masses. Disoriented by the change and stunned by the depth of the economic  crisis, the workers have in general kept their heads down. But slowly they are  be ginning to draw conclusions. A recent authoritative opinion poll held by the  All Russian Centre for the Study of Public Opinion and the University of  Strathclyde concluded that two-thirds of the people now think that life was  better before Perestroika. This compares with 50% in 1992. 78% were dissatisfied  with their family&rsquo;s economic position. 65% said they were worse off than five  years ago. And 36% said they had received their wages late this year.</p>
<p>
The Yeltsin government  finds itself between the devil and the deep blue sea. Under the relentless  pressure of imperialism, they agreed to cut state expenditure. For instance,  military spending was supposed to be cut. Now the military caste is demanding a  real increase in their share of the budget. Fearing a social explosion, the  parliament approved an increase in the minimum wage from 20,000 rubles a month  to 54,000 a month. As many welfare payments are based on this figure, this  measure alone will cost 30 trillion rubles, or half the proposed budget  deficit. This means new financial crises, more inflation and a further collapse  of the currency.</p>
<p>
What this reflects is a  deepening conflict between conflicting class interests, which is far from being  resolved in a decisive way. That is what the strategists of capital mean when  they complain that the situation in Russia is &ldquo;unpredictable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
For their part, the  imperialists are also aware of the threat of &ldquo;social instability&rdquo; as they  express it. Not for nothing did Yeltsin warn the West repeatedly of the danger  of a &lsquo;new Bolshevism&rsquo; if they did not support him. The miners&rsquo; strikes served  forcibly to underline the point. Yeltsin has been obliged to retreat on the  issue of miners&rsquo; wages, at least for the time being. He has blamed the  non-payment of wages in general on &ldquo;saboteurs.&rdquo; But any commitment to pay  arrears will mean an increase in the huge budget deficit. This was, anyway,  inevitable in the run up to the election.</p>
<p>
The IMF, obviously under  pressure from Washington, is turning a blind eye to the fact that Moscow is  manifestly not fulfilling its commitment to monetary discipline. Behind all  these manoeuvres there are two main calculations: fear of major social  upheavals in Russia which could spread to Eastern and Western Europe, and the  need to keep Yeltsin in power at all costs, for fear of the alternative.</p>
<p>
The very fact that the  imperialists are concerned that the movement towards capitalism has not yet  reached the point of no return impels them to put pressure on Moscow to  continue the reform at all costs, as quickly as possible, irrespective of the  social consequences. They are pushing the situation to its limits, thus  creating the conditions for an explosion. Some of the more far-sighted Western  observers are beginning to realise the dangers in this. The next phase of  privatisation would be the most dangerous from the point of view of social  stability, as the Financial Times pointed out on the 12th of August 1995:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The Russian government is  poised to decide on the next and most dangerous step in its three-year old  reform process. Going ahead would mean launching a full attack on inflation,  closing many obsolete factories and starting to create a working social  security system with the aid of up to $18 bn. (&pound;11.6 bn.) provided through the IMF&hellip;The  scale of the transformation now being debated in the government and with IMF  experts would be larger than anything yet attempted and would risk creating  social unrest and political instability.&rdquo; (our emphasis.)</p>
<p>
The idea of the hard-faced  bankers of the IMF funding social welfare in Russia can be taken with a large  pinch of salt. In general, the West has been lavish with promises of aid to  Russia, but very short on delivery. The only part of this paragraph that  matters is the promise to carry out a massive programme of factory closures,  which would cause huge unemployment and terrible suffering. The real attitude  of the Western financiers was shown by the president of the Swiss bankers, Mr.  Markus Lusser, who was quoted in the same article as warning that the IMF  risked &ldquo;financial and moral ruin&rdquo; if it continued to display a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; attitude  to Russia.</p>
<h4>Pessimism of nascent  bourgeoisie</h4>
<p>
Because of the collapse of  the productive forces and increased demand for Western goods, Russia now  imports more than half its consumer goods. As a result of this situation,  Russia is highly vulnerable to imported inflation&#8212;a direct result of  the collapse of the ruble. A large part of these imports are luxury goods for  the nascent bourgeois, which plays an entirely parasitic role. By contrast,  most of the earnings from exports is sent abroad to bank accounts in Germany  and Switzerland. The crisis of capitalism mean that even &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; Swiss  banks are not fussy about where their money comes from. The <em>Financial Times</em>  (7/2/96) notes that:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Switzerland&rsquo;s economic  problems have made some of its companies and financial institutions more  willing to accept &lsquo;dirty&rsquo; money from international criminal organisations,  including the Mafia, according to senior European police officials.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The trend coincides with  predictions of a rise in money leaving Russia in coming months because of  mounting fears among newly rich entrepreneurs that the Communists will win  presidential elections in June.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The fact that they have  stashed huge quantities of money away in foreign bank accounts is no accident.  Nor are the big houses which they have been purchasing in London in the last  period. It is said that the total value of London property bought last year by  Russians exceeds the total aid programme of Britain to Russia. This little  detail tells us a great deal about the attitude of the Russian nascent  bourgeoisie towards the future.</p>
<p>
The slogan of the nascent  bourgeois is: &ldquo;Get rich and get out!&rdquo; The sons and daughters of the elite are  already voting with their feet, as a recent article in The Guardian (1/2/96)  indicated, citing the fact that over 2,000 visas are processed every year by  the US consulate in Moscow for Russian students, in addition to thousands more  enrolled in private schools in Western Europe. The attitude of this &ldquo;gilded  youth&rdquo; was summed up in the words of an economics student, &ldquo;I hate my country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Like many members of the  emerging privileged class who have come of age at a time when Russia has open  borders, Ms. Mikhailova has had the chance to compare the hardships at home  with the abundance abroad and has decided that a life of sacrifice is not for  her. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anything good will ever be created in Russia.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The children of those  prospering from Russia&rsquo;s new found capitalism are leaving in droves to start  careers in countries where they might be better rewarded&hellip;A  common feeling among young people is a weakening desire to build a better  Russia. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t feel any obligation to this country,&rsquo; said Masha Zakharovich,  aged 20, who returned for the winter holidays. She is on a scholarship at  Berry College in Mount Berry, Georgia.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;&lsquo;The only patriotic  feelings I have are for my parents, for the flat where I grew up, for my  friends&#8212;certainly not for the government.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
These lines reflect the  outlook, not of &ldquo;young people&rdquo; in Russia, most of whom are struggling to  survive, but of the children of the nascent bourgeoisie. They certainly do not  imply that optimism in the future which is the hallmark of a historically  progressive class, but rather the kind of cynical and self-centred nihilism of  a reactionary class of parasites which, immediately after birth, displays all  the signs of senile decrepitude. If such moods of economic defeatism exist  among the children of the nouveaux riches, still more must their fathers and  mothers be infected with doubts and fears for the future.</p>
<h4>Capitalist restoration  in Eastern Europe?</h4>
<p>
Is it possible to establish  capitalism in a &ldquo;cold&rdquo; way? Trotsky did not think so. Yet, in Eastern Europe,  this appears to be happening. Marxists must never be afraid to say what is. Lenin  pointed out that &ldquo;history knows transformations of all sorts.&rdquo; And that is  certainly the case. The first European who saw a giraffe is supposed to have  exclaimed &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; But, as materialists, we are compelled to  believe the evidence of our senses, even where this contradicts preconceived  ideas.</p>
<p>
In 1989, there were mass  protest movements all over Eastern Europe. The potential was present for a  political revolution. But in the absence of mass revolutionary parties, the  movement was diverted onto other lines. In Czechoslovakia, Havel had a  pro-bourgeois position from the beginning. In East Germany, the leaders of the  protest movement originally did not want to go back to capitalism. In Hungary,  it was the ex-Stalinists themselves who started the slide towards  counterrevolution even earlier. But, despite the differences, in all these  countries the bourgeois tendency got the upper hand. There were a number of  reasons for this. First, the absolute impasse of the bureaucratic system;  second, the temporary boom in the West, and the pressure of German capitalism;  third, the fact that, unlike Russia, Communism was imposed from without and  widely identified with foreign oppression and rule from Moscow; last, and most  importantly, the absence of a revolutionary party and leadership, which could  have posed an alternative.</p>
<p>
With the exception of  Rumania, there was no uprising. The decrepit bureaucracy collapsed without a  fight, or collaborated with the capitalist counterrevolution. Rumania was an  indication of the revolutionary potential of the proletariat. The West was  seriously alarmed, as shown by their appeals to Gorbachov to intervene. The  elements of dual power existed in Rumania in the workers&rsquo; committees and  factory militias. But once again, in the absence of the party, the movement was  derailed, this time by the Stalinist faction. The same thing would have  undoubtedly happened to the soviets in 1917, had the Bolshevik party been  absent.</p>
<p>
The decisive factor was the  impasse of the economy under the bureaucratic regime. If they had been able to  maintain the rate of growth, the bureaucracy would not have changed anything at  all. Just across the border, in capitalist Germany and Austria, the economy  appeared to be booming. In the last analysis, there was not much to choose  between the bourgeois and Stalinist gangsters, once the growth rate reached  zero. Despite everything, the prevailing mood of the working class was to  maintain state ownership, but with democracy and reform, even in East Germany.  This, in essence, is also what we wanted.</p>
<p>
The situation in Eastern  Europe is not uniform. There are differences between the different countries,  which make precise comparisons difficult. The Baltic states are too close to  Russia, and have the problem of large Russian minorities within their borders,  a potentially explosive issue for the future. A Stalinist regime in Moscow, or  an aggressive imperialist one, could swallow them up with a single mouthful.  The West could do nothing to prevent it. The economies of Rumania, Bulgaria,  Serbia, Bosnia and Macedonia are too backward to make them attractive to  Western investors. Privatisation here has not gone very far. Even Slovakia,  despite being part of the original &ldquo;Vysegrad group&rdquo;, is an uncertain case.  Slovakia began the process of privatisation whist still part of Czechoslovakia,  but has since gone back:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;But now Slovakia is going  backwards on privatisation: it has halted the use of vouchers and is selling  off state companies mostly to those who run them: ex-apparatchiks chummy with  Mr. Meciar.&rdquo; (<em>The Economist</em>, 18/11/95.)</p>
<p>
It is necessary to  distinguish between different cases, as the bourgeois certainly do. If we leave  out of account the special case of East Germany, we can distinguish broadly  between two blocks&#8212;the so-called &ldquo;Vysegrad group&rdquo; (the Czech  Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Slovenia and Hungary), and the rest. The process of  privatisation in the Czech Republic, and its integration with the German  economy has gone very far. It is possible, but by no means certain, that the  point of no return has been reached. The situation in Hungary is also unclear,  although the process there has also gone quite far. The case of Poland is still  more doubtful. Slovenia&rsquo;s economy is small enough to make its absorption by  Germany, together with Austria and Italy, a viable proposition.</p>
<p>
As before the War, Italy  has designs on Albania, a small and backward country, which could end up as an  Italian colony in the Balkans. The same may be true, at a later stage, of  Croatia in relation to Germany. The prospects for capitalism in all the other  states of Eastern Europe and the Balkans are far from hopeful. Romania, Serbia,  Bulgaria, Macedonia and Bosnia are poor and backward economies with unstable  regimes. Privatisation has not made much progress, and there is very little  foreign investment. Slovakia is a border-line case. What happens in these  states depends upon events outside their borders, above all, in Russia and China.</p>
<p>
East Germany is a special  case, because here the restoration of capitalism is a product of absorption  into the most powerful capitalist state in Europe. It can be taken for granted  that the process has already passed the point of no return, although even here  it is not free from contradictions. As shown by the high level of unemployment  and the undercurrent of discontent, mirrored, as in other Eastern European  countries, in increased support for the ex-Stalinist party, the PDS, which  recently scored a big success in East Berlin. In the future, the radicalised  working class of East Germany can play a big role in fertilising the German  working class with socialist ideas. It will not be an easy morsel to digest,  especially now that German capitalism is entering into crisis.</p>
<p>
Commenting on the  differences between these states, <em>The Economist</em> points out:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Each country has gone it  own way. The Czech Republic has concentrated on vouchers in order to move fast.  Hungary has focused on sell-offs in hopes of encouraging efficient management,  but this has gone badly wrong in places. Poland started with sell-offs, but  found the process slow and is now moving to vouchers. Somehow it all comes down  to the same thing: because there is virtually no accumulated capital in private  hands, the state ends up paying for most privatisations. Since it is all new,  the rules are often imprecise or simply lacking altogether.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;This disturbs foreign  investors, the ones with real money. And although Central European countries  desperately need foreign capital, their revived sense of identity arouses  nationalist qualms about being bought our by foreigners. Poland and Slovenia in  effect ban outsiders from owning land. The Czech Republic and Slovakia restore  property to owners dispossessed under communist rule; Hungary does not. Only  large foreign companies with real clout, such as Volkswagen, Siemens and  General Electric, have been able to move through this thicket with any ease.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;By and large, the energy  and telecoms sectors remain state domains with, at most, only minority stakes  being sold off. Older heavy industry is still in state ownership in most  places, even if foreign buyers are attracted by it (which on the whole they are  not). &lsquo;Private owners cannot be invented,&rsquo; says Joze Mencinger, a former economics minister in Slovenia. &lsquo;New capital must come from profits it will take  the private economy years to build up.&rsquo;&rdquo; (<em>The Economist</em>, 18/11/95.)</p>
<p>
According to some  estimates, up to 80% of the economy of the Czech Republic is now in private hands.  If this is the case then it would suggest that the process here has also  reached the point where quantity becomes transformed into quality. However, the  claim that up to 80% of the economy of the Czech Republic is privatised is not  accepted by serious western analysts. The <em>Financial Times</em>, in a recent survey  of the Czech Republic, had this to say on the subject: </p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The government&rsquo;s boast  that 80% of the economy is in private hands is, however, an exaggeration. The  National Property Fund still holds big stakes in many partly privatised  companies and sits in corporate board rooms alongside private shareholders, who  wield most influence.&rdquo; (<em>Financial Times</em>, 2/6/95.)</p>
<p>
The same point was made by  <em>The Economist</em>:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;It is when it comes to  privatisation that the Czechs tend to exaggerate. Mr. Klaus&rsquo;s motto is &lsquo;Any  private owner is better than the state.&rsquo; But the quick privatisation method he  adopted&#8212;the distribution of the share vouchers among the  population&#8212;can easily create an illusion of private ownership in  place of the real thing. The government&rsquo;s claim that 80% of Czech GDP already  comes from the private sector is debatable. Responsibility for &lsquo;privatised&rsquo;  factories is often simply shifted from the state to local authorities. The  Czechs hail their privatisation effort as brisk and clear, but plenty of  obscure corners remain.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;For example, the stable,  market-minded Czech Republic might be expected to prove irresistibly attractive  to foreign investors. Yet total foreign investment since 1990, at under $4  billion, has been relatively disappointing. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t buy what you want in  this country,&rsquo; German businessmen can be heard lamenting. Volkswagen runs  Skoda, the Czech carmaker; but a famous distillery at Karlovy Vary (Karlsbad  to Germans) lost its lure for German buyers when the government in Prague,  reluctant to let go of a &lsquo;national treasure,&rsquo; decided to limit the sale to a  minority holding. In one way or another, the government still controls much of  basic industry. The remarkably low unemployment rate, below 5%, suggests that  so far it has failed to undertake much of the essential industrial  restructuring the country needs.&rdquo; (<em>The Economist</em>, 18/11/95.)</p>
<p>
And again:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;At first sight, the scale  of the transfer has been phenomenal. In the space of five years, the private  sector&rsquo;s share of the economy has jumped from near zero to 60%-plus (crowing  Czechs claim 80%). Much of this, however, is voodoo privatisation. It gets  industry off the state&rsquo;s books, but for the most part &lsquo;private&rsquo; industry in  Central Europe is still short of real money and real owners. Moreover, the  process has brought deep corruption, some of it so ingenious that one cannot  help admiring the entrepreneurial flair behind it. The whole thing is aptly  summed up by Lech Walesa&rsquo;s old line: &lsquo;It is easy to turn an aquarium into fish  soup, but not so easy to turn fish soup back into an aquarium.&rsquo;&rdquo; (<em>The  Economist</em>, 18/11/95.) </p>
<p>
There are 70 million people  in Eastern Europe. On the face of it, a tempting market. But living standards  are low&#8212;only one third of the EU average. Germany&rsquo;s interest in  Poland and the other states on its eastern borders is both economic and  strategic. It would like to take advantage of the raw materials and cheap  labour, and also to create a buffer zone separating Germany from Russia. The  best way to ensure German domination of these countries is by incorporating  them in the EU. In practice, they are already German satellites. Well over  half the region&rsquo;s trade is now done with Western Europe, and Germany has the  lion&rsquo;s share. Germany provides the bulk of the foreign investment there,  followed by the US and Italy. In practice, Eastern Europe has become part of  the D-mark zone. From Slovenia to Poland, ask anyone what their car costs, and  the answer is likely to be in D-marks.</p>
<p>
However, the growth of  German power and influence is being watched with anxiety by Britain and France,  as well as the poorer EC members like Spain whose interests lie, not in the  East, but in the Mediterranean. Britain, while formally in favour of allowing  the new states to join, in practice is blocking them by insisting on  maintaining the right to veto.</p>
<h4>Foreign investment</h4>
<p>
The fate of the Czech  Republic is closely connected to its link with Germany. German imperialism was  responsible for the criminal splitting of Czechoslovakia&#8212;which was  against the interests of both Czechs and Slovaks, and would have been defeated  if it had gone to a referendum. But Klaus, the agent of German imperialism in  Prague, made sure that the people were not consulted.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The shadow over Central  Europe is not only Russia&rsquo;s. Germany casts a bigger one, and for once the  region is happy to see it there&hellip;However, since worries about German domination  are never far from the surface in this region, Germany tactfully refers to  itself as the Central Europeans&rsquo; &lsquo;tutor&rsquo; or &lsquo;advocate.&rsquo; In the same vein,  Germans refrain from talking about Mitteleuropa, a handy term but one fraught  with history. It harks back to a time when the German Reich made precious  little distinction between its economic and its military ambitions there. It is  better for Germany not to overplay its new hand. After all, everyone knows that  Berlin, its reinstated capital, is part of what one might call greater Central  Europe&#8212;of which Berlin will in all probability emerge as the  metropolis.&rdquo; (<em>The Economist</em>, 18/11/95).</p>
<p>
The national question is  still important in Eastern Europe, where the historical memory of foreign  domination is still a powerful factor. Initially, the domination of Germany  seemed to many to be preferable to subordination to Moscow, particularly if it  meant the entry of large amounts of German investment and German living  standards. For the great majority, however, this is an unattainable dream.  Investment has been patchy, and accompanied by mass layoffs and closures, even  in the Czech Republic, as the <em>Financial Times</em> points out:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;But foreign investment has  developed a bad image among many ordinary Czechs. Disillusion set in after  Volkswagen curtailed its big investment in Skoda Auto in 1993, expensively  hired American managers failed to pull round the ailing Tatra truck plant and  Air France pulled out of Czechoslovak Airlines last year.&rdquo; (<em>Financial Times</em>,  2/6/95.)</p>
<p>
The promise of big foreign  investment has not met expectations: </p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Poland bemoans a  disappointingly slow rate of foreign investment. In Warsaw you will be told  that the $4 billion or so of foreign capital invested in Poland since it turned  democratic is roughly what the Germans are spending on doing up a single street  in east Berlin, Friedrichstrasse.&rdquo; (<em>The Economist</em>, 18/11/95.)</p>
<p>
The Hungarians and Czechs  have done better, because they are seen as more &ldquo;stable.&rdquo; But the attitude  towards foreign capital was illustrated in the following remarks by Vaclav  Brom, spokesman of the big Czech company CKD Praha Holding:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Many foreign companies  came to the Czech Republic with one aim: to take part in our companies, to  control the business, cancel R &amp; D (research and development) and transfer  work to themselves and to use us as cheap labour.&rdquo; (<em>Financial Times</em>, 2/6/95.)</p>
<p>
The calculations of Germany  are transparent. What is now the Czech Republic is based on the former German  colony of Bohemia-Moravia. Its proximity to Germany, developed industry and  skilled labour force make it a useful adjunct for the German economy and source  of cheap labour. The re-establishment of capitalism in the Czech Republic is  thus a product of its semi-absorption by Germany. The case of Hungary also has  peculiarities. Faced with the impasse of Stalinism, the Hungarian bureaucracy  decided, even before Gorbachov&rsquo;s reforms, to start the movement towards  capitalism. This is in the Hungarian tradition. Let us recall that in 1918, the  Hungarian bourgeoisie handed over power to the Communists without a fight.  Capitalism in Hungary was only restored, as a result of the bungling of Bela  Kun and the CP leaders, by armed intervention of the Rumanians, backed by  France.</p>
<p>
The inner stability of  these regimes will ultimately be determined by the attitude of the masses to  it. Here the most important question is its ability to achieve higher living  standards and better conditions than the previous regime. In fact, the movement  towards capitalism has been accompanied by a catastrophic fall in living  standards. By comparison, the masses look back to the period of Brezhnev as a &ldquo;golden  age.&rdquo; What is true for Russia is also true, in greater or lesser measure, for  the other countries of Eastern Europe. </p>
<p>
The bourgeois press is  recently full of glowing reports about the &ldquo;economic recovery&rdquo; in Poland. There  has indeed been a recovery in Poland over the last three years. According to  figures recently published by the General Statistics Office (GUS) the Polish  economy grew by 7% in 1995. They speak of shops lined with high quality  imported goods, new stores, restaurants and banks, and a boom in private car  ownership. That the economy has picked up is not surprising. No economy can  continue to fall forever. That is also true for Russia, which will probably  begin to pick up somewhat in the next twelve months. But what they call a &ldquo;recovery&rdquo;  means, in practice, that Poland&rsquo;s industrial production only just reached the  level of 1989 last year. And what did this feat signify for living standards?  The <em>Financial Times</em> (5/2/96) reports:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;But the gains have not  been equally spread. GUS show that GDP was 3% higher than in 1989, but this has  been accompanied by massive job cuts. While the loss of jobs has contributed to  higher productivity, it has also left a total of 2.6 m. people registered as  unemployed. </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Also, for millions of  Poles improved macro-economic performance has meant cuts in real incomes after  the 1990 &lsquo;shock therapy&rsquo; market reforms and the collapse of the Soviet market.  The purchasing power of the average wage is only 75% of 1989 levels as a  38-fold increase in prices has outpaced income growth. But the rich have grown  richer.&rdquo; (Our emphasis.) Moreover, the fall in living standards is reflected in  a dramatic drop in the birth rate. This, in spite of the violent hostility of  the Roman Catholic hierarchy to abortion and birth control:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;At home, many families  have adapted to lower real in comes by having fewer children. Despite a recent  virtual church ban on abortion. Last year saw the smallest population increase  in Poland since the war.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;This is partly a  reflection of the acute housing shortage. Housing completions are down to  1940s levels with only 58,400 dwellings finished last year compared to  150,200 in 1989 and an annual peak of over 250,000 in the late 1970s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Private house building in  Poland now accounts for 50% of the total, against 37% in 1989. Unlike other  Eastern European countries, Poland had a large private agriculture and  co-operative sector even before 1989. Thus, even at that time, 47% was recorded  as working in the private sector. That figure increased to 63% in 1995, which  is not as much as it seems, if we take into consideration the starting point,  plus the fact that, in the same period, 40% of state sector enterprises  disappeared. There are still nearly 4,360 state-owned companies in Poland. &ldquo;The  others collapsed under the weight of their own debts, were taken over by  private investors or were bought out by management and employees. At the same  time the number of private joint stock companies has grown sixfold to 95,017.&rdquo;  (<em>Financial Times</em>, 5/2/96.)</p>
<h4>The peasantry and the  working class</h4>
<p>
Some 58% of the land area  of Central Europe is dedicated to farming, as opposed to 43% in the EU. The  sector accounts to 5.5% of regional GDP, over twice its share in the EU. Its  agriculture poses a direct threat to France, which has opposed the eastward  expansion of the EU. Already about half the EU&rsquo;s budget is taken up by the  Common Agricultural Policy. The entry of Germany&rsquo;s eastern satellites would  signify an increase in Europe&rsquo;s farm expenditure of one-third. This would mean  the collapse of the CAP, something which France would fight tooth and nail.</p>
<p>
Paradoxically, even in  Eastern Europe the peasants do not provide a mass base for capitalist  restoration, as Trotsky had thought. Living on small, unproductive plots of  land, from which they can barely scratch a living, they have quickly realised  that the &ldquo;market economy&rdquo; offers them nothing except insecurity, high prices  and ruin. The attitude of the majority of peasants to the new regime is  accurately portrayed in the following example:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Jan Kalinski farms a few  of those strips, a morning&rsquo;s walk from Lukow, a small market town halfway  between Warsaw and Poland&rsquo;s border with Belarus. His aim in life is to keep the  wolf from the door. He, his wife, his five children and his ailing mother live  in a two-room wooden shack put up around 1900, down a mud lane off the Lukow  road. Nothing much has changed here in a century. The wiry Mr. Kalinski has  just turned 40, but looks 20 years older. He has two cows, some pigs, chickens,  a strip for potatoes and a strip for barley. His farm is six-and-a-half  hectares (16 acres), close to the Polish average of seven. The EU average is  16.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;On a green and peaceful  autumn morning, Mr. Kalinski grumbles that prices are too low to make it worth  selling anything. He was much better off before communism ended. The Russians  took what he produced at a decent price. &lsquo;Before, you could sell anything. Now  you have to sell twice as much to get the same bag of fertiliser. The Russians  still want our stuff, but they have no money to pay. The Germans have enough of  their own stuff, and all they want to do is sell to us.&rsquo; On the radio, Mr.  Kalinski hears all the time that Poland is preparing to enter the EU, but he is  not counting on manna from heaven. &lsquo;Roll up your sleeves and help yourself,  that&rsquo;s all we hear. The only way for a farmer here to make money is to open a  shop. Soon there&rsquo;ll be more shops than farmers.&rsquo;&rdquo; (<em>The Economist</em>, 18/11/95.)</p>
<p>
The position of the workers  in the cities is no better. The Hungarian economy has experienced a growth in  real terms, although more slowly than the 6% which represents the average for  Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the recent period. But there is a  question mark over the future. For all these countries, the economic  perspective for the EU is the fundamental question. The present slowdown does  not bode well for them. Despite the growth, living standards have continued to  decline for the majority. Real income in Hungary fell by 10-12% in 1995, and  are expected to fall by a further 2% in 1996. Inflation remains high. This  causes the strategists of capital to fear an outbreak of strikes which could  undermine the &ldquo;reform&rdquo;:</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Union opposition, if  excessive inflation makes this real decline (in income) even more acute, could  yet de rail reforms.&rdquo; (Independent Strategy, 10/1/96). And their conclusion,  typically, is&#8212;a further attack on living standards:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The principal task for the  next two or three years must therefore be get inflation under control (into  single digits). Hungary must cut the size of the public sector through  privatisation. And despite the opposition of the courts, the government must  reduce social expenditure which still accounts for a third of GDP.&rdquo; (Ibid., our  emphasis.)</p>
<p>
Even in the Czech Republic,  the movement towards capitalism has been accompanied by a rapid rise in unemployment and a fall in living standards. The collapse of Comecon, the former  trading block linking eastern Europe and the USSR, deprived the industries of  Czechoslovakia, Poland and the rest of their natural markets. Even now, half of  the foreign sales of the big CKD holding company and engineering group  traditionally at the heart of Czech industry, whose workforce has been cut from  25,000 to 12,000 in the past five years are with Russia and other former parts  of the Soviet Union. </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Employment in the biggest  20 companies has been cut by between 30 and 40 per cent over the past five  years,&rdquo; Karel Dyba, the Czech minister of the economy is quoted as saying, &ldquo;The  Ostrava coal mines have cut back by 50-60 per cent.&rdquo; At the same time, the  parasitic finance sector has quadrupled. The public optimism in the future of  the Czech economy is contradicted by the words of Vladimir Dlouhy, the minister  of trade:</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Over 3,000 state owned  enterprises are waiting for liquidation. In the meantime, they keep sucking up  subsidies and keeping people inefficiently employed.&rdquo; Here is the authentic  voice of the bourgeois counterrevolution! Up till now, says Dlouhy, &ldquo;we have  been comparing ourselves favourably with the other former communist countries  in the region. from now on we should adopt a tougher yardstick and compare our  productivity with that of the EU countries we aspire to join.&rdquo; (FT, 2/6/95.)</p>
<p>
The article adds:</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The signs are that with  mass privatisations now formally over, managers of the newly privatised  companies will act more determinedly in future to cut costs and raise  productivity. They are expected to shed excess labour, invest in new plant and  attract foreign partners.&rdquo; (Our emphasis.) This is a finished recipe for class  struggle in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>
The growing discontent of  the masses is reflected in in creased support for the &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; parties all  over Eastern Europe. What happened in Poland was particularly significant.  After all that had happened, the CP won, not only the elections but ousted  Walesa from the Presidency. This shows an important shift in the attitude of  the masses. However, the incredibly corrupt and degenerate Polish ex-Stalinists  have continued down the road of capitalism. The decisive section of the  bureaucratic elite are transforming themselves into private capitalists. In  this way, they will prepare the ground for a ferocious reaction at a later  date, and the coming to power of a vicious bourgeois Bonapartist regime which  will make the old Pilsudski dictatorship look tame.</p>
<p>
Such a regime, however,  would not even have the kind of relative stability that Pilsudski enjoyed.  After all, he based himself on the support of the peasants, whereas the Polish  peasants today understand that they have no future under the capitalist regime,  and are hostile to it. This phenomenon, which is not peculiar to Poland, is a  striking indication of how the class balance of forces has changed to the  detriment of the bourgeoisie since Trotsky&rsquo;s time. The strength of the working  class and the weak mass base of reaction rules out stable and long-lasting  bourgeois regimes in Eastern Europe. There will be a whole period of social and  political crises, as they try in vain to find a way out of the impasse. The  working class will have many opportunities to transform society, and   Marxism will have many opportunities to establish itself as the dominant  current in the working class.</p>
<p>
The fate of Eastern Europe  is bound up with events in Russia and Western Europe. Since the late Middle  Ages, the destiny of these small states was entirely dictated by the actions of  Russia, Germany (the Teutonic Order, Prussia) and, until 1918, Austria. For  centuries, Poland did not exist as an independent state, being divided at  different times between Russia, Prussia and Austria. Hungary only became  independent in 1918, before which it was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire,  as was Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. The other Balkan states were dependent on  one or another of the imperialist powers, especially Germany, but to some  extent, France, Russia and Britain also. The Baltic states were either under  Poland, or Russia, or German colonies. The Ukraine was divided between Russia  and Poland up to 1939, and was occupied by Germany in 1918 and in the Second  World War. Up to 1945, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, all were weak,  semi-feudal economies, overwhelmingly agrarian, dominated by foreign capital,  with corrupt, dictatorial Bonapartist regimes.</p>
<p>
Above all, what happens in  Russia will be decisive. If Zyuganov moves to renationalise industry, that  will have a dramatic effect. The whole of Eastern Europe would go the same way.  The ex-Stalinist leaders would do yet another somersault, and get enthusiastic  support from the working class. It is even possible that the workers of Poland  or Hungary would move to take the control of society into their own hands,  leading to the establishment of healthy workers&rsquo; states. The Polish workers  have the tradition of 1956, 1970, 1976 and 1980. The Hungarian workers have the  tradition of 1919 and, above all, the glorious Hungarian Commune of 1956. These  traditions will be rediscovered in the course of struggle. But the central  problem remains the building of the subjective factor, the absence of which has  led to the derailing of the great movements of the past.</p>
<h4>Class contradictions</h4>
<p>
Trotsky was convinced that  a capitalist counterrevolution could only come about as a result of civil war.  He wrote:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The October Revolution has  been betrayed by the ruling stratum, but not yet overthrown. It has a great  power of resistance, coinciding with the established property relations, with  the living force of the proletariat, the consciousness of its best elements,  the impasse of world capitalism, and the inevitability of world revolution.&rdquo;  (Leon Trotsky,<em> The Revolution Betrayed</em>, p.252.)</p>
<p>
And again:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;If&#8212;to adopt a  second hypothesis&#8212;a bourgeois party were to overthrow the ruling  Soviet caste, it would find no small number of ready servants among the present  bureaucrats, administrators, technicians, directors, party secretaries and  privileged upper circles in general. A purgation of the state apparatus would,  of course, be necessary in this case too. But a bourgeois restoration would  probably have to clean out fewer people than a revolutionary party. The chief  task of the new power would be to restore private property in the means of  production. First of all, it would be necessary to create conditions for the  development of strong farmers from the weak farms and for converting the strong  collectives into producers&rsquo; co-operatives of the bourgeois  type&#8212;into agricultural stock companies. In the sphere of industry,  denationalisation would begin with the light industries and those producing  food. The planning principle would be converted for the transitional period  into a series of compromises between the state power and in dividual &ldquo;corporations&rdquo;&#8212;potential  proprietors, that is, among the Soviet captains of industry, the &eacute;migr&eacute;  former proprietors and foreign capitalists. Notwithstanding that the Soviet  bureaucracy has gone far toward preparing a bourgeois restoration, the new  regime would have to introduce in the matter of forms of property and methods  of industry not a reform, but a social revolution.&rdquo; (Ibid., p.253.)</p>
<p>
So far, that prognosis  appears to be contradicted by what has happened in Eastern Europe and Russia.  But it is far from clear how this process will end. In reality, at every stage,  the movement towards capitalism has encountered obstacles and resistance. It  has not all been in one direction. The 1991 coup and the storming of the White  House were not peaceful occurrences. The conflict between different wings of  the bureaucracy was expressed, not in the language of parliamentary debate, but  in that of tanks and machine guns. This fact alone is sufficient to show that  the contradictions within the bureaucracy are not at all secondary ones.</p>
<p>
Marxism approaches social  phenomena from a class point of view. What is the class character of the  bureaucracy in Russia at the present time? To pose the question is to answer  it. The whole point is that, in the present transitional state, the bureaucracy  is riven with contradictions which, at bottom, have a class character. A  section of the bureaucracy, which certainly comprises the majority of the top  layer, is in the process of transforming itself into capitalists. The clearest  representative of this trend is the Prime Minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, who  has become a billionaire on the basis of the privatisation of the huge state  gas company, Gasprom. </p>
<p>
Trotsky long ago predicted  that the bureaucracy would not be satisfied with the perks and privileges derived from control of the nationalised industries, but would seek to transform  themselves into property owners in order to consolidate their position and pass  on their wealth to their children. That prediction has proven to be correct.  But he did not confine himself to this general observation, but went far deeper  in his analysis of the different trends in the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>
The bureaucracy is not a  homogeneous class like the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is a large and  extremely heterogeneous social formation. Between the elite and the local Party  secretary there was always a considerable difference. In the event of a  revolutionary movement of the working class, the lower ranks of the bureaucracy  would come over in large numbers to the side of the revolution. But even in the  higher reaches of the bureaucracy, there were always contradictory tendencies.  Trotsky warned that the bureaucracy would betray the Revolution, that they  would seek to guarantee their income and privileges, and have the right to pass  on property to their children by converting themselves into proprietors. But  only the top layers would benefit.</p>
<p>
On the one hand, there is a bourgeois government which is attempting with  might and main to push in the direction of capitalism. But it is encountering  resistance at many different levels. This is far from a straightforward  process! Yeltsin has established a &ldquo;bourgeois democracy&rdquo; which is nothing of  the sort. On the other hand, there is a corrupt &ldquo;Mafia capitalism&rdquo; which  presides over a frightening economic collapse. There is ten times more  corruption than before. And superimposed upon all this mess is the same old  bureaucracy. More than before, in fact. In the Russian Federation there are 1,8  times more bureaucrats than in the USSR&#8212;with 130 million fewer  population.</p>
<p>
The Chernomyrdin wing of the bureaucracy wants the privilege of ownership,  another wing&#8212;the &ldquo;Red Barons&rdquo; prefers to cling to the old system,  while between the two extremes there are a mass of middle-ranking and lower  officials who are unsure, and will back whatever side appears to be winning.</p>
<p>
Before the War, Trotsky spoke of the Butenko and Reiss factions in the  bureaucracy. Butenko was a Soviet functionary who went over to the fascists,  whereas Ignace Reiss, an officer of the GPU, declared for the Fourth International  before he was murdered by Stalin&rsquo;s agents. What Trotsky meant was that, within  the ranks of the bureaucracy, there were a whole range of tendencies, from open  counterrevolutionaries like Butenko up to genuine Leninists like Ignace Reiss.  He added that the former were much more numerous than the latter, especially in  the upper reaches. But not even Trotsky could have foreseen the ghastly  degeneration of the Stalinist bureaucracy.</p>
<p>
The main reason for this was the fact that the Stalinist regime in Russia  lasted far longer than Trotsky had originally anticipated. The prolongation of  the bureaucratic regime for almost three generations had profound effects on  all classes and strata of Soviet society. The degeneration of the upper  layers&#8212;now the grand children of bureaucrats &ldquo;born in the purple,&rdquo;  as they used to say of Byzantine emperors&#8212;went far further than  Trotsky, or we, had ever thought possible.</p>
<p>
By the physical extermination of the Old Bolsheviks, Stalin succeeded far  more than we realised in extirpating the old traditions and breaking the  umbilical chord connecting the working class to the ideas of October. At least  two generations grew up in the nightmare regime of Stalinist totalitarianism.  Lacking all experience or knowledge of the democratic and internationalist  ideas of real Leninism, their consciousness was thrown far back. This partly  explains the temporary disorientation of the Russian workers in the last  period. This is an important element in the equation, and one that we did not  sufficiently appreciate at the time.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, it would be completely wrong to assume that the traditions of  Bolshevism have been entirely eradicated from the psychology of the Russian  workers. On the contrary. In contrast to Eastern Europe, where Stalinism, in  addition to all its other crimes, was seen as a &ldquo;foreign import&rdquo; associated  with national oppression and rule from Moscow, Bolshevism is the only real  tradition of the Russian proletariat, schooled in three revolutions, the Civil  War, the Five Year Plans and the heroic struggle against Hitlerism. The fact  that, despite everything, the mass of the Russian workers still look to the &ldquo;Communist&rdquo;  Party is a striking proof that the idea of Communism and October still lives in  the hearts and minds of millions.</p>
<p>
Trotsky&rsquo;s prediction of civil war has so far not materialised. But that can  change. There has not yet been a turning point which would decisively alter  relations between the classes. The relative passivity of the working class, as  a result of decades of Stalinism, has been the decisive factor that has  conditioned the whole situation, as we have pointed out many times. But the  vote in the December election served notice of an important shift in the mood  of the masses. Even more significant, the mass strikes of miners and teachers  demanding payment of back wages shows that the temporary passivity of the class  is drawing to a close. At a certain stage, probably not far off, the class will  move into action against the hated Mafia-capitalism and the section of the  Nomenklatura which rests upon it. From that moment, the whole situation will be  transformed.</p>
<p>
As Lenin frequently pointed out, the mass of workers learn from experience.  They have just passed through a very hard school indeed! And now they are  beginning to draw conclusions. Suffice it to recall that the miners only a few  years ago were supporting Yeltsin. This is precisely how the class learns. The  example of the Russian miners, many of whom had illusions in &ldquo;the market&rdquo; and  who have now voted overwhelmingly for the Communist Party, is significant.</p>
<h4>The December elections</strong>
  </p>
</h4>
<p>
The December elections were an important stage in the process. What tendency  did they reveal? At any rate, not one in the direction of capitalism! This was  a massive vote of no confidence, not only in Yeltsin, but in the &ldquo;market&rdquo; and  all its works. True, an election result is never decisive, and this one least  of all. The Bonapartist constitution leaves all power in the hands of Yeltsin  and his clique. Nothing has been solved. But that is precisely the point. The  problem of establishing a viable capitalist regime in Russia has not been &ldquo;solved.&rdquo;  The December election was a clear indication of the hurdles that the nascent  bourgeoisie must clear before it does so.</p>
<p>
The December elections in Russia represented a body-blow to the supporters  of capitalist restoration in Russia. The Communist Party got 22% of the votes  in the constituencies where candidates were elected on the basis of party  lists. It also did well in those which elected individuals (&ldquo;single member  constituencies&rdquo;). Together with the Agrarians and other parties describing  themselves as Communists, they received about one third of the vote.</p>
<p>
Vladimir Zhirinovsky&rsquo;s LDP saw its votes in the party-list elections halved  from 22% in 1993 to 11% now, winning only one seat in the single-member  constituencies. This indicates that a growing number of people have seen  through his &ldquo;populist&rdquo; demagogy and recognised the reactionary nature of the  LDP. Alexander Lebed, the latest candidate for the role of the Russian  Bonaparte, an avowed admirer of Pinochet, got only 4%, although he may get more  in the Presidential election in June&#8212;if it takes place.</p>
<p>
However, the most shattering defeat was reserved for those parties and  politicians who openly espoused the cause of the &ldquo;market economy&rdquo; reform, which  has led to a catastrophic collapse of production and living standards. Claims  of the government that the economy had improved rang hollow to millions of  Russian workers who are owed two or three months&rsquo; wages.</p>
<p>
The voters took their revenge by massively rejecting the pro-capitalist  parties. &ldquo;Russia&rsquo;s Choice,&rdquo; the inappropriately-named party of the extreme  pro-marketer Yegor Gaidar, was wiped out. It got less than 5%, and Gaidar lost  his seat in the parliament (Duma). Grigorii Yavlinsky&rsquo;s Yabloko did better with  7%, but he has been demagogically attacking the government&rsquo;s reform programme  for months. Most damaging of all for Yeltsin and the West was the humiliating  result of the party of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, &ldquo;Our Home is Russia.&rdquo;  This party, specifically set up to defend the government, with access to huge  sums of money and unlimited access to the media, got less than 10%.</p>
<p>
When the final result was published, the CP and its allies were the largest  group by far in the Duma, with 190 seats out of 450, followed by Zhirinovsky  with 51, and Yavlinsky with 45. &ldquo;Our Home is Russia&rdquo; has only 55 seats, a very  weak base from which to campaign for the presidential election.</p>
<p>
The imperialists reacted with horror to these results, which represent a  massive vote of no confidence in &ldquo;market reform,&rdquo; precisely when the West is  pressing Yeltsin to hurry the programme through, in a desperate effort to make  the process irreversible, regardless of the social consequences. The election  results entirely confirm the perspectives that the movement towards  capitalism, far from being completed, is in serious trouble.</p>
<h4>The &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; Party and the unions</strong>
  </p>
</h4>
<p>
The most striking development is the rapid recovery of the &ldquo;Communist&rdquo;  Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF). Even before the December elections, the  party, which claims 550,000 members, in October, swept the board in local  elections in Volgograd, taking almost every seat on the council. The rapid  recovery of the CP is a very striking proof of the law worked out by Marxists  that, when the working class begins to move, it always expresses itself through  its traditional mass organisations, although in a surprising way which we did  not anticipate. In the past, the CPSU was not a workers&rsquo; party at all, but an  organ of the bureaucracy. It acted as an appendage of the state, consisting  mainly of aspiring bureaucrats, careerists, spies, informers and agents.  Through the Party, and also the state-controlled &ldquo;unions,&rdquo; the totalitarian  regime extended its tentacles into every factory and workers&rsquo; district. This  was one of the factors that allowed it to survive for so long, giving it the  appearance of monolithic stability.</p>
<p>
But with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the crisis of Stalinism, the  old relations have undergone a transformation. The party is no longer an asset  to that wing of the bureaucracy which wants to move towards capitalism. On the  contrary. The party and the unions are dominated by that section of the  bureaucracy which has gained nothing from the &ldquo;reform&rdquo; and is hostile to it.  The chairmen of collective farms, managers of big state owned enterprises and  the host of lesser officials, party and trade union secretaries and the like,  who have become obstacles in the road of the nascent bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>
After the defeat of the 1991 coup, the pro-bourgeois faction led by Yeltsin  lost no time in radically separating both the CP and the unions from the state  and depriving them of their privileged position. The CP and union officials  were compelled to lean on the working class in order to maintain some kind of  base. In the absence of any alternative, the workers have turned to these  organisations, which now play a similar role to that of the traditional mass workers&rsquo;  organisations in the West. The leaders of this party have, in fact, much the  same outlook, programme and philosophy as the reformist leaders in the West.</p>
<p>
The fact that the CP was persecuted and even temporarily illegalised by the  bourgeois Yeltsin government undoubtedly gained it widespread support, on the  principle &ldquo;the enemy of my enemy is my friend.&rdquo; This development is another  salutary lesson in the dialectical way in which even the most apparently  hopeless and moribund organisations can be transformed, once the workers begin  to move. Despite the reformist illusions of the leaders, the fact that the CPRF  now has a mass base in the working class is a very important new element in the  situation.</p>
<p>
A similar process has occurred in the trade unions. The old unions, which  contained both workers and factory managers, were no more genuine organisations  of the working class than the Spanish &ldquo;vertical trade unions&rdquo; under Franco. But  that situation no longer applies. The trade unions are no longer linked to the  state, and have moved into semi-opposition. By contrast, the leaders of the  so-called &ldquo;Independent Unions&rdquo; have gone over to the bourgeois counterrevolution lock, stock and barrel. Even the supposedly &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; SOTSPROF has  gone over. In any case, they represent an insignificant force, whereas the  overwhelming majority of the workers are in the old &ldquo;official&rdquo; trade unions.</p>
<p>
Even in the big strike movement of 1989, which pushed the official unions to  one side, there was no mass exodus from them. The workers set up unofficial  strike committees to organise the struggle, but once the strikes were finished,  they still had the need of stable organisations with national structures. The  existence of a deep crisis made the union organisations still more necessary,  the more so since in the USSR the unions always played an important role in the  field of health, social security and the like.</p>
<p>
The main reason, however, is simply that there was no alternative. Boris  Kagarlitsky and Renfrew Clarke describe the evolution of the &ldquo;Independent  Unions&rdquo; as fol lows:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The first generation of activists in the independent labour movement held  numerous hopes that turned eventually into cruel disappointments. The leaders  of the workers&rsquo; committees took a suspicious attitude to the intelligentsia,  but were readily co-opted by government apparatchiks and local political  leaders who used the miners to further their own intrigues. Within a few years  many leaders of the strike committees became prosperous business entrepreneurs  and state officials. The slogan &lsquo;The workers&rsquo; movement should stay out of  politics!&rsquo; was used to justify a refusal to pursue an independent working class  political course, and later, to bind the worker&rsquo; committees to the policies put  forward by Yeltsin and his neo-liberal associates&#8212;policies that were  anti-worker in their very essence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The attempt to build independent unions such as the Independent Union of  Miners (NPG) and the Association of Socialist Trade Unions (SOTSPROF) ended in  failure. SOTSPROF first changed the word &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; to &ldquo;social,&rdquo; then dropped  it altogether. Later, the anarchists and socialists who had been active in  SOTSPROF from the early days were expelled. There were scandals involving  corruption in both SOTSPROF and the NPG. &ldquo;After two years,&rdquo; the authors write, &ldquo;the  &lsquo;old&rsquo; and &lsquo;new&rsquo; unions had effectively swapped roles. The &lsquo;alternative&rsquo; union  organisations merged increasingly with the authorities, while the traditional  unions took on the role of an independent opposition force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The old All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions was abolished and the  General Confederation of Trade Unions took its place. After the collapse of the  USSR, this was transformed into an &ldquo;international organisation.&rdquo; The Russian  unions set up the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia (FNPR)  headed by Igor Klochkov. Some of the new leaders were people who had been  active in the strikes of 1989 and 1990. There was thus a partial renewal of the  union leadership, with the entry of new elements, ready to break with the past  of the &ldquo;official&rdquo; state controlled unions.</p>
<p>
After August 1991, when the Communist Party was suspended and the structures  of the USSR collapsed, the unions remained practically the only mass  organisations in Russia. More than 80%, according to Kagarlitsky and Renfrew  Clarke, &ldquo;remained faithful to their organisations despite the changes that had  taken place.&rdquo; There was a process of radicalisation within the unions, even at  leadership level, reflecting the growing discontent of the workers with the  social costs of privatisation:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;But as the social costs of the reforms became obvious, the FNPR officialdom  underwent a radicalisation. The trade unions fought for the indexation of  wages, and for the setting of the minimum wage at a level equal to the  subsistence minimum income. Privatisation, accompanied by job losses and often  by the shutting down of enterprise union organisations, aroused acute  dissatisfaction among unionists. Within the FNPR, the conviction grew that the  social interests of workers were being defended far better in state sector  enterprises than in privatised ones. This, of course, ran directly counter to  the philosophy of the Russian government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Throughout 1993, there were mass meetings and stoppages in the Urals, a  one-day warning stoppage of miners in Rostov Province in the South, a general  strike in the Maritime Province in the Far East, in which the strikers demanded  the resignation of the government. Unlike the movements in 1989 and 1990, the  struggles in the Summer of 1993 were led by the trade unions and took place on  an all-Russian basis. However, the union leaders, lacking a clear perspective  or a coherent alternative to the government&rsquo;s policy, confined themselves to &ldquo;constructive  opposition.&rdquo; The attempt to conciliate were redoubled after the crushing of  parliament by Yeltsin in October 1993. The bombardment of the White House  produced panic among the union tops. Mikhail Shmakov, leader of the Moscow  Trade Union Federation (MFP) advocated &ldquo;moderation&rdquo; while trying to bring the  situation under control.</p>
<p>
The pusillanimous policy of the leadership clashes head long with the  growing mood of anger and frustration that is building up in the factories and  mines. There is no hope of conciliating between the nascent bourgeoisie, whose  interests demand the ruthless driving down of living standards, and,  ultimately, the destruction of trade union organisation, and the working class  which is engaged in a life-and-death struggle for survival. The opposition  trend within the unions will develop parallel with the tendency for the unions  themselves to adopt a semi-opposition or even an openly opposition stance. It  is absolutely necessary for the Marxists to find a way to the rank and file of  the Russian trade union movement, which, together with the CPRF, is the key to  the whole situation.</p>
<h4>Constitutional illusions</strong>
  </p>
</h4>
<p>
The big swing to the CP does not mean that the workers accept Stalinism.  Having gone through the experience of &ldquo;market&rdquo; reform, they correctly conclude  that &ldquo;things were better before.&rdquo; They would like to enjoy the benefits of full  employment and the other advantages of a nationalised planned economy, but  without the oppressive totalitarian rule of the bureaucracy. In reality, they  aspire to a regime of workers&rsquo; democracy on the lines of 1917, but on a higher  level. This would really be possible now, on the basis of a developed modern  economy. It would be possible to introduce immediately a four day working week and  six hour day. Russia could start to move in the direction of socialism. The  prior condition for this is that the workers take power into their own hands,  through genuine soviets&#8212;workers&rsquo; councils. If Zyuganov were a real  Communist, he would make the setting up of workers&rsquo; councils the basis of his  campaign. Such a demand flows from the entire situation.</p>
<p>
The threat that Yeltsin will call off the election is very real. Yeltsin&rsquo;s  constitution concentrates most of the power in the hands of the president, who  is supposed to come up for election in June. But Yeltsin knows that, as things  stand, he would be slaughtered. One poll in late December gave him just 6%. He  may therefore be tempted to postpone, or even cancel the election. But it is  not certain he could get away with this. Yeltsin already rigged the  referendum, so he is no stranger to such methods. He must know that, on the  present basis, his chances of winning a fair election are negligible. Even in  his home town of Yekaterinburg his support has melted away. In a desperate  attempt to get the signatures necessary for Yeltsin to stand, his henchmen have  intimidated railway workers, threatening them with the sack if they did not  sign. When this was exposed, Yeltsin threatened to beat his campaign manager.  Such things suggest that there is already panic in the President&rsquo;s camp.</p>
<p>
Afflicted with the disease of constitutional cretinism, Zyuganov is waiting  for Presidential elections which may never take place, or, if they do, may be  rigged. He expects to win the election and spends most of his energies trying  to conciliate the bourgeois and Western &ldquo;public opinion.&rdquo; These attempts will  fail. Despite all his &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; speeches to the Moscow Chamber of Commerce,  the nascent bourgeoisie is not convinced. Nor are the imperialists, who were  alarmed at the December result. They are not impressed by the &ldquo;moderate&rdquo;  speeches of CP leader Gennady Zyuganov, but want to know what he will do if he  comes to power. In an attempt to placate the fears of foreign governments and  businessmen, Zyuganov turned up at the World Economic Forum at Davos. The  reaction of those present was predictable:</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What the Davos suits are really worried about is how come Communism is back  on the agenda all of a sudden? Anxiously they press Zyuganov on every occasion,  but he never quite gives the answers they want to hear. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a natural thing,  a market,&rsquo; he says with a shrug. Yes, he wants a larger private sector. How  large, exactly? Well&hellip; Yes, he wants to bring some  of the republics back into Russia. How? Well&hellip; Yes, he does worry about  Nato spreading to the Russian borders. How much? Well&hellip;&rdquo;  And <em>The Independent</em> commentator concludes:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The fact that the word &lsquo;Communism&rsquo; still wins big electoral support in  Russia does suggest to me that there is unfinished business there&hellip; That they might wish to elect Zyuganov is nothing  in itself; that they might still wish to elect Communists is everything.&rdquo; (<em>The  Independent</em>, 7/2/96.)</p>
<p>
<em>The Economist</em> on the 10th of December 1995, expressed very clearly the  fears of the West. &ldquo;The Party,&rdquo; it wrote, &ldquo;might still seek to rebuild the  former Soviet Union (&lsquo;voluntarily,&rsquo; of course), reduce the presidency to a  figurehead, put Boris Yeltsin on trial and renationalise swathes of Russian  industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The serious representatives of the bourgeoisie have a far more realistic  grasp of the situation than the ex-Stalinist Zyuganov. The problem yet again is  the absence of the subjective factor. By voting massively for the Communists,  the workers have demonstrated their opposition to the &ldquo;market&rdquo; and all its  works. If Zyuganov were really a Communist, the problem would be solved. But  the leaders of the CPRF are very far removed from Communism of any sort. These  ex-Stalinists, like their colleagues in Poland and Hungary, are so bankrupt and  myopic that they are attempting to embrace the &ldquo;market&rdquo; at the very moment when  the masses have drawn the conclusion that capitalism is the source of all the  ills of society.</p>
<p>
As early as 1928, Leon Trotsky warned that the theory of &ldquo;Socialism in one  country,&rdquo; if adopted, would inevitably lead to the national-reformist  degeneration of all the parties of the Communist International, At that time,  the prediction was greeted by ridicule by the CP leaders, who still considered  themselves revolutionary internationalists. But history has taken a cruel  revenge on those who so haughtily dismissed Trotsky&rsquo;s warning. Everywhere,  without exception, the leaders of the &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; parties have abandoned any  pretension to stand for the ideas of Marx and Lenin which, in practice, they  had ditched decades ago. They have capitulated to the pressures of reformism  even more completely than the leaders of the Second International in 1914. And  just as the collapse of the Second International laid the basis for the  emergence of the revolutionary internationalist tendency of Leninism, so the  collapse of Stalinism is clearing the decks for the rise of the genuine Marxist  current which stands on the basis of the ideas of Lenin and Trotsky.</p>
<p>
Ex-Stalinists like Zyuganov and Kwasniewski like to imagine themselves as &ldquo;realistic  statesmen.&rdquo; This is a delusion which they share with all reformist leaders. But  there is even less of a rational basis for this delusion in Russia and Poland  than in Britain, Spain or Sweden. The crisis of capitalism signifies the crisis  of reformism. This observation is far truer in Russia than anywhere else. The  frightful collapse of the productive forces provides no basis for reforms. Any  attempt to increase state expenditure would lead immediately to the nightmare  of hyperinflation, a further steep collapse of investment and the rouble and a  social and economic catastrophe.</p>
<p>
Capitalism can only be established in Russia on the basis of driving down  wages below their minimum level in order to accumulate the necessary capital  for investment. Such a policy is incompatible with free trade unions, the  right to strike, and, ultimately, the existence of any democratic rights. Thus,  the idea of Zyuganov that it is possible to combine &ldquo;market reform&rdquo; with the  welfare state and democracy is an at tempt to square the circle. If he comes to  power with such a programme, it could only lead to a new catastrophe, preparing  the way for a ferocious dictatorship of one kind or another.</p>
<p>
This peculiar situation is caused by the horrific degeneration of Stalinism.  Zyuganov and co. do not represent the working class, but that section of the  Nomenklatura which has not benefited from the move towards capitalism, and  wishes to lean on the workers in order to recover its lost power and  privileges. It is not even clear that they would do this by going back to the  so-called &ldquo;command economy&rdquo; of the past. They would be willing to compromise,  up to a point, in the field of consumer production, leaving a part of light industry in private hands. The precise proportion would depend on the correlation  of forces. If the CPRF moves towards the renationalisation of industry, that  would have a tremendous effect throughout Eastern Europe. The CPs in Poland and  Hungary would either follow the lead from Moscow or split.</p>
<p>
While a section of the bureaucracy would undoubtedly be in favour of this,  the utterances of Zyuganov suggest that the ruling clique of the CPRF wants to  continue the &ldquo;reform&rdquo; albeit at a slower pace, that is to go down the &ldquo;Polish  road.&rdquo; If, as is possible, to judge by the speeches of Zyuganov, the leaders of  the Russian &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; Party come to power and try to pursue capitalist  policies, they will be compelled to administer the kind of medicine prescribed  by the IMF. This will inevitably usher in a new period of economic, social and  political convulsions which will make the past period look like a tea-party by  comparison. The process is a contradictory one, however, and Zyuganov may not  be able to follow the &ldquo;Polish road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
It is impossible to say what will happen on the basis of what Zyuganov says.  The fact is that Zyuganov himself does not know what he is going to do. These  ex-Stalinists have nothing in common with Marxism. They have no strategy for  taking power, no ideas, no principles, and, of course, no intention of  appealing to the working class, except to vote for them. The so-called &ldquo;Communist  Party&rdquo; is, in reality, only a new, even more repulsive, version of a reformist  party. So why are the bourgeois worried?</p>
<p>
Given the depth of the crisis, it is not ruled out that Zyuganov might be  forced to move in a different direction. The leading reformist Yegor Gaidar, in  a recent interview, warned of just such a possibility: &ldquo;Do not assume,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;that Russia&rsquo;s reforms are irreversible or that the Communists are  benign.&rdquo; (<em>The Independent</em>, 17/10/95.) Of course, Gaidar has a vested interest  in frightening the West about the &ldquo;Communist threat.&rdquo; Nevertheless, what he  says is not at all impossible. The utterly corrupt and degenerate Russian  Mafia-capitalism has an extremely feeble and unstable character. Once in power,  Zyuganov, who likes to be all things to all men, may be compelled to go further  than he intends. The decisive element in this equation is the Russian working  class, which is slowly beginning to recover from the recent traumas and draw  conclusions. That is the real meaning of these elections and the strikes that  followed.</p>
<h4>The miners&rsquo; strike</strong>
  </p>
</h4>
<p>
The only reason the process in Russia could take the form that it did was  the absence of pressure of the working class. This is now beginning to change.  The more farsighted strategists of capital realise the danger of a social  explosion in Russia. The inertia of the powerful Russian proletariat will not  last forever. Last December, even before the elections, we repeated yet again  that: &ldquo;Strikes, demonstrations and uprisings are inevitable at a certain stage.  Paradoxically, a slight improvement in the economy, which the government is  hoping for, could be the signal for an outburst of strikes. However, in the  immediate period, it is more likely that the workers will turn to the political  front and vote for the &ldquo;Communists&rdquo; in the hope that they will bring better  days. When this does not materialise, the stage is set for a stormy period in  Russia.&rdquo; This prediction materialised far sooner than we anticipated with the  mass strikes of miners and teachers in January.</p>
<p>
Up to half a million miners in Russia and another million in the Ukraine  went on strike to demand payment of backpay. The strike movement swept through  the coalfields of Southern Russia, North Urals and Siberia, precisely the areas  which provided the backbone for Yeltsin&rsquo;s faction in 1989. This fact, better  than anything else, illustrates a fundamental shift in the consciousness of  the masses. The strike was solid. Even Rosgul, the state coal monopoly admitted  that 118 out of 182 were on strike. The real figure must have been higher.</p>
<p>
Actions ranged from refusing to deliver coal for a limited period to the  demand for an all-out strike. Political demands were also present. Miners  marched through the streets of Vorkuta in the far North demanding the resignation of Chernomyrdin. The new spirit of defiance was summed up in the phrase  of one miner reported in <em>The Independent</em> (2/2/96): &ldquo;A miner can work on his  knees on the coal face, but he cannot live on his knees and never will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
In the Ukraine, about 400,000 miners stopped work in 76 pits out of a total  of 277. In a further 91, the miners refused to deliver coal. The Kiev  government refused to negotiate with the strikers, on the grounds that they  were bound by an agreement with the IMF. The miners had not been paid since  October 1995. In the Donbass Basin 30 pits are threatened with closure under a  framework plan proposed by the IMF. <em>Le Monde</em> (8/2/96) described the mood of  the Ukrainian miners as follows:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;When the Donbass miners meet to discuss their strike, they do so under a  portrait of Lenin, with an inscription: &lsquo;Coal is the bread of industry.&rsquo; When  they demonstrate, it is in front of a statue of Lenin in Lenin Square. The  Donbass, the huge mining basin in the Eastern Ukraine, is in the grip of a &lsquo;proletarian  protest.&rsquo; Here, people address each other as &lsquo;tovarishch&rsquo; (&lsquo;comrade&rsquo;). Not just  out of habit; they do it from conviction. Because &lsquo;the class struggle has  broken out again&rsquo; a toothless old miner declares, and there seems to be no  alternative. &lsquo;We must choose between Lenin and Coca Cola!&rsquo; exclaims one  striker, frustrated at seeing shops emptied of local products and full of  imported goods which he cannot afford.</p>

&ldquo;Anyway, there is not much the miners of Donbass can afford. They have been  on strike since the first of February, because their wages (the equivalent of  $100 a month) have not been paid for five months. Nor pensions, nor invalidity  benefit, and there are many on the latter in Donbass. &lsquo;In what civilised  country do miners go to work on an empty belly?&rsquo; an indignant trade unionist  asks at a meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The strike movement gives the workers a sense of their own power and  identity as a class. &ldquo;&lsquo;We will bring them to their knees!&rsquo; intones Vasil Khara,  a trade unionist, when speaking of the Ukrainian government. &lsquo;This will be like  1989,&rsquo; he adds, alluding to the big strike of Soviet miners which dealt a death  blow to Mikhail Gorbachov&rsquo;s perestroika.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Once the class begins to move, they rapidly begin to draw political  conclusions, linking their problems to the general state of society. Anatoly  Gerevich, a forty year old striker quoted by <em>Le Monde</em>, curses the &ldquo;market  economy,&rdquo; which he defines as follows: &ldquo;Just take any businessman. The sausage  he sells is ours. His shop is ours. But the suitcase full of money belongs to  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The conclusion is inescapable: things were better before. &ldquo;Before we lived  in a rich and respected country. Now we are citizens of a banana republic.&rdquo;  This is no isolated phenomenon. An opinion poll organised by the International  Foundation for Electoral Systems published one year ago established that 92% of  Ukrainians were &ldquo;dissatisfied with the general situation,&rdquo; and 90% thought that  it was the government&rsquo;s responsibility to guarantee people a job. When asked  whether the economy should return to state control, 46% said yes, as against  31% who wanted to reduce the state&rsquo;s role, and 24% who did not know or failed  to answer. The opposition to capitalism will have increased still further after  the Russian elections and the miners&rsquo; strike.</p>
<p>
The stormy strike movement caused shock waves in the political establishment  in Moscow. It is significant that the Communists, who are now the biggest block  in the Duma, immediately passed a vote of solidarity with the striking miners.  This little incident is an indication of how a Zyuganov government would find  itself under the pressure of an aroused working class&#8212;a detail which  will not be lost on the imperialists.</p>
<p>
The strike went ahead despite the attempts of Yeltsin to deflect it by  offering to pay up. He blamed poor organisation for the delays and threatened to  sack the local bureaucrats responsible. But the problem of unpaid wages, which  is widespread throughout Russian industry is not the result of the bungling of  local officials, but the inevitable result of the disorganising of industry  through the dismantling of central planning. Anatoly Yakunin, a Rosugol  official, blamed the crisis on energy plants and factories that owe mines more  than $400 million for de liveries. This problem will not be solved by demagogic  speeches or by sacking a few officials. On the contrary. The plan to proceed  with the wholesale closure of factories and the withholding of government  subsidies will make the situation a thousand times worse. Although the miners  have temporarily suspended the strike, on the strength of government promises,  there is no doubt that this marks a turning point in the situation. The  patience of the Russian workers is reaching its limits.</p>
<h4>The threat of Bonapartism</strong>
  </p>
</h4>
<p>
In such a context, the prospect of a return of the &ldquo;Communists&rdquo; fills the  nascent capitalists with dread. No amount of reassuring speeches by Zyuganov  can calm these fears, which are not as irrational as they seem. Lacking any  real understanding of the broad historical processes, these people possess  enough cunning to know how to distinguish between words and deeds. They know  that the masses have learned enough about market economics to be completely  hostile to &ldquo;reform&rdquo; and that the new rich are hated. They also know that a  Zyuganov government will be under intense pressure from the workers, and that  the Communist Party is divided. Can Zyuganov be trusted? The answer to this  question lies, not in his subjective intentions or moral character, but in the  class balance of forces.</p>
<p>
After five years, the movement towards capitalism has succeeded in creating  a serious social base. According to some estimates, the nascent bourgeoisie is  something like ten percent of the population, with a further ten percent  dependent on their activities in one way or another. 20% is approximately the  figure we get if we add up the votes of all the openly pro-capitalist parties  in the December elections, so this estimate is probably quite accurate. One  fifth of the population of Russia is a not inconsiderable force. Although most  of them consist of &ldquo;human dust&rdquo;&#8212;crooks, spivs, black marketeers,  petit-bourgeois&#8212;they have vested interests to defend, and access to  large supplies of arms. Against these forces, we have the millions of workers  who vote for the CP and its allies&#8212;roughly one third of the total.  Moreover, the class balance of forces can never be reduced to a purely  arithmetical relationship.</p>
<p>
The core of the CP&rsquo;s support lies in the heavy industries, where huge  numbers of workers are concentrated in big enterprises. Many of these are owed  large amounts of back pay. They have seen their living standards destroyed and  their families reduced to poverty, while the new rich flaunt their wealth under  their noses. The burning indignation of the workers threatens to boil over in a  social explosion which could sweep all before it. The recent miners&rsquo; strikes  were a serious warning to those who had written off the Russian proletariat.  The key to the whole situation to date has been the absence of an independent  movement of the proletariat. Given its enormous size and power, once the  Russian working class begins to move, it can swiftly transform the entire  position. At this stage, the workers are mainly looking to the electoral front  to solve their problems. But the inevitable intrigues set in motion by the bourgeois  and Yeltsin to stop the CP from coming to power can easily trigger a violent  conflict between the classes.</p>
<p>
The possibility of such a social explosion is implicit in the situation.  Given the colossal weight of the Russian working class, it could not be  theoretically ruled out that such a movement might lead to the overthrow of the  regime, even before the working class has had time to organise a  party&#8212;a new edition of the Paris Commune. After all, this was what  occurred in Hungary in 1956. The rotten nascent bourgeoisie would not be able  to offer serious resistance to a general movement of the Russian workers. They  would be brushed aside like an insignificant mosquito. Such a development, it  is not necessary to emphasise, would completely transform the whole world  situation. Needless to say, a revolutionary movement of the workers is  something which fills all sections of the bureaucracy with dread. One of the  reasons that Zyuganov has adopted his &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; tone is that he wishes to  avoid an open showdown between the classes in which he is not sure he could  control the masses. That is why he is desperately trying to get an agreement  with the nascent bourgeoisie and imperialism.</p>
<p>
In <em>In Defence of Marxism</em>, Trotsky points out that it is necessary to give  critical support to the Stalinist bureaucracy in struggle against capitalist  regimes. At the same time, one had to distinguish clearly between situations  where the bureaucracy is playing a relatively progressive role and where its  actions are of a reactionary character. In connection with the Soviet invasion  of Finland, he wrote:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;This bureaucracy is first and foremost concerned with its power, its  prestige, its revenues. It defends itself much better than it defends the USSR.  It defends itself at the expense of the USSR and at the expense of the world  proletariat. This was revealed only too clearly throughout the entire  development of the Soviet-Finnish conflict. We cannot therefore take upon ourselves even a shadow of responsibility for the invasion of Finland which  represents only a single link in the chain of the politics of the Bonapartist  bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;It is one thing to solidarise with Stalin, defend his pol icy, assume  responsibility for it&#8212;as does the triply infamous  Comintern&#8212;it is another thing to explain to the world working class  that no matter what crimes Stalin may be guilty of we cannot permit world  imperialism to crush the Soviet Union, re-establish capitalism and convert the  land of the October Revolution into a colony. This explanation likewise  furnishes the basis for our defence of the USSR.&rdquo; (Trotsky, <em>In Defence of  Marxism</em>, p.219.)</p>
<p>
What is the most pressing task for the Russian workers at the present time?  To prevent the nascent bourgeoisie from liquidating what remains of the  historical gains of October; to prevent the capitalist enslavement of the  working people of Russia; to stave off the impending social catastrophe which  threatens to push a large part of the people into physical and moral barbarism.  The focal point of this struggle can be stated quite simply: The essential task  in Russia at the present time is to defend state property against the nascent  bourgeoisie, while simultaneously fighting for workers&rsquo; democracy.</p>
<p>
Incidentally, this shows the theoretical and practical bankruptcy of the  idea of &ldquo;state capitalism.&rdquo; According to this &ldquo;theory,&rdquo; the regime in the USSR  was already capitalist long ago. Why, then, should workers bother to defend the  old forms of state ownership (&ldquo;state capitalism&rdquo;) against the nascent bourgeoisie,  since there is no difference between them? This line of argument, which would  completely disarm the working class in the face of the capitalist  counterrevolution, is a glaring example of how a false theory leads inevitably  to a disaster in practice.</p>
<p>
To the degree that one wing of the bureaucracy actually takes steps to  oppose the capitalist restoration, we are obliged to support them. Of course,  this does not mean in the slightest degree supporting their policies and  methods, which are not aimed at mobilising the masses, but on defending the  privileged position of the bureaucrats. While supporting them against the  nascent bourgeois, we will explain to the workers that the only real safeguard  against restoration is to take the power into their hands. At the centre of our  programme is the slogan of soviets&#8212;workers&rsquo; councils, both as organs  of struggle and future organs of workers&rsquo; power.</p>
<p>
In practice, that wing of the bureaucracy which stands for the defence of  state ownership (however indecisively) is organised in the CP. This shows the  stupidity of those who entirely wrote off the CP in 1991, preferring to piddle  around with so-called &ldquo;independent&rdquo; groups, with predictable results. If we  pose the question concretely&#8212;do we give critical support to the CP  against the parties of the nascent bourgeoisie?&#8212;for anyone except the most  thick-headed sectarian, the question answers itself. Not only would we give  critical support, but we would certainly work inside the CPRF, and, of course,  the unions, and attempt to win over the best of the workers and youth to the  ideas of Trotskyism. Our method would be that of Lenin&#8212;&rdquo;patiently  explain.&rdquo; We would put forward the full programme of workers&rsquo; democracy, while  supporting the CP against the Yeltsinites. In contrast to Zyuganov&rsquo;s  constitutional and parliamentary cretinism, we would warn against the danger of  a coup and put forward a fighting programme to defeat reaction, based on the  independent movement of the proletariat, organised in soviets.</p>
<p>
The formation of action committees in every workplace, street, army  barracks, college and collective farm would be the way to mobilise the  population in defence of the most elementary democratic demands. This is the  only way in which whatever elements of democratic rights that exist can be  defended. Starting with defensive demands around opposition to postponing the  elections, the non-payment of wages and the general social collapse, and  linking these immediate issues to the demand for a nationalised planned economy  under the democratic control and management of the working people, the  Communist Party would get overwhelming support. Under such conditions, any  attempt to call off the elections would lead to the swift overthrow of Yeltsin  and the establishment of a genuine regime of soviet democracy.</p>
<p>
If the Russian workers fail to take power, then the present unstable  equilibrium of forces will have to be resolved, one way or the other. The  democratic parliamentary illusions of Zyuganov and co. bear no relation  whatever to the real position. Their failure to solve the problems of society  will prepare a bloody outcome, perhaps even civil war. Zhirinovsky seems to  have lost ground recently, as people begin to realise what lies be hind his  rabid chauvinist demagogy. It is a condemnation of the CP leaders that, instead  of combating this reactionary demagogue, they have flirted with nationalism.  This is playing with fire!</p>
<p>
If the extreme nationalists are in opposition, they would be the main  beneficiaries of the failure of the CP to carry out a policy in the interests  of the workers. Their support would grow. It is not likely that the military  caste would hand over power to Zhirinovsky, who shows every indication of being  clinically insane. But there is no lack of suitable candidates for the role of  the Russian Bonaparte, starting with Lebed. The same opinion poll which showed  that two-thirds of Russians were opposed to capitalism also revealed that an  astonishing 80% were disillusioned with all political parties. This fact  indicates the existence of fertile soil for the spread of Bonapartist  tendencies. When the ex-Stalinists betray the aspirations of the masses, the  stage would be set for a coup.</p>
<h4>Role of the Army</strong>
  </p>
</h4>
<p>
The possibility of Bonapartism flows from the fact that society finds itself  in a complete impasse. The working class, paralysed by the leadership, is  unable to take power, but the nascent bourgeoisie is too weak to set its stamp  decisively on society. The deadlock between the classes enables the state to  rise above society and acquire a large degree of independence, as Trotsky  explains, following the classical analysis of Marx, Engels and Lenin:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Caesarism, or its bourgeois form, Bonapartism, enters the scene in those  moments of history when the sharp struggle of two camps raises the state power,  so to speak, above the nation, and guarantees it, in appearance, a complete  independence of classes&#8212;in reality, only the freedom necessary for a  defence of the privileged.&rdquo; (Leon Trotsky, <em>The Revolution Betrayed</em>, p. 277.)</p>
<p>
At the present time, the bureaucracy is divided between that section which  wants to go towards capitalism, and another wing that is either opposed or  unsure. Up till recently, the first group has set the tone. Their confidence  has been based on three things. First, the complete impasse of the old  bureaucratic system; second, the pressure and &ldquo;support&rdquo; of imperialism, which  held out the prospect of aid, loans and investment; third, and most importantly,  the lack of any serious counter-movement. Contrary to Trotsky&rsquo;s expectation  (and our own), the working class did not move into action, at least in the  first period. The boom in capitalism in the period 1982-90 was another factor,  creating illusions not only in the bureaucracy, but even in sections of the  working class. But the most important element was the absence of the subjective  factor. If there had been a genuine Leninist party of a few thousand, with  roots in the factories, the whole situation would have been different. But  there was nothing. </p>
<p>
A section of the bureaucracy looks with alarm at the general economic and  social collapse. The wing that is opposed to capitalism includes not just the  lower strata of the bureaucracy which is in touch with the working class, but a  section of the upper layer also. They are motivated by considerations, not of  an ideological but of a purely practical character. Five years of market reform are enough to convince them that capitalism is not delivering the goods.  Apart from the terrible economic collapse, there is the crime, the social  disintegration, the loss of power, income and prestige, the humiliation on the  international arena. The sensation grows that all this is wrecking Russia. This  idea is particularly galling to the armed forces&#8212;not just the  ordinary soldiers, whose demoralisation was starkly revealed in the Chechen  conflict, but among sections of the officer caste. The army is only a copy of  social relations. The top brass, represented by Pavel Grachev, are in cahoots  with Yeltsin, and busy feathering their nests, but they represent a small  minority. The great majority of officers, from the rank of colonel down, feel  bitter and angry at the loss of their privileges, and outraged by their sense  of national humiliation.</p>
<p>
The bureaucracy came under enormous pressure from imperialism, especially in  the first stages of the process. The relationship can be traced through the  behaviour of Yeltsin in this period. The Russian &ldquo;strong man&rdquo; acted as a  complete lackey and agent of imperialism, collaborating with NATO and the USA  over Iraq, Bosnia, and everything else. But now that has all changed. The  officer caste has for some time been flexing its muscles. The downfall of the  Foreign Minister Kozyrev, a typical &ldquo;reformer&rdquo; and apliant stooge of  Washington, and his replacement with the &ldquo;hard-liner&rdquo; Primakov indicates both  the inevitability of a period of increasing tension with the West and the  increasing as sertiveness of the officer caste. </p>
<p>
So far the army has remained uneasily on the sidelines. It has not really  entered into the struggle. In October 1993, the officer caste waited till the  last minute before finally coming down on Yeltsin&rsquo;s side. Even then, only a  handful of officers actually participated in the assault on the White House,  and some of them were reported to have been since murdered. The growing  discontent in the military is an open secret. Recently, Defence Minister Pavel  Grachev stated that the army had received only 40% of budgeted appropriations  for June 1995. As a result, less than a third of Russia&rsquo;s two million military  personnel were paid. The mood in the barracks was described in the British CP  daily <em>The Morning Star</em> as follows:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Underfunding has cut sharply into the military&rsquo;s cohesion, spirit and  ability to react to crisis. Corruption scandals in the general staff have  damaged the army&rsquo;s public reputation and deepened the malaise in lower ranks&hellip;Bitterness has grown in the officer corps over the  use of the armed forces in internal Russian conflicts, such as the storming of  the former parliament building in Moscow in October 1993 and the ongoing war in  Chechnya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The threat of a coup is  understood even by the CP leaders, who appear to be attempting to organise  their supporters among the army officers. General Albert Makashov, one of the  leaders of the armed defence of the White House in 1993 and now a CP member of  parliament, says:</p>
<p class="quote">&ldquo;We all understand that the  Army, the structures of power, can finally resolve the power struggle. This is  very well understood by the President and his team and they act accordingly. We  must support the activities of those officers who help the CP. The time has  come to create an analytical centre to co-ordinate professionally work with the  military.&rdquo; (<em>El Pa&iuml;s</em>, 16/2/96.)</p>
<p>
Nezavisimaya Gazeta also  thinks that the main problem facing Zyuganov is that of &ldquo;establishing the  necessary contacts in the armed forces ministries and special services in order  to prevent the introduction of direct presidential rule (a euphemism for a  coup) after the announcement of the election results.&rdquo; The same paper considers  that the army will stay neutral, and that the masses will come out on the  streets to &ldquo;force the Kremlin to recognise the victory of the Left candidate.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Towards a new October</h4>
<p>
The removal of General  Lebed was a desperate attempt to prevent the crystallisation of an opposition  within the armed forces. Lebed did poorly in the December elections, partly as  a result of accepting second place on the list of a little-known politician.  Lebed&rsquo;s Bonapartist ambitions have not been dimmed by this setback, and he will  stand for President. It is not sure whether his ambitions will be successful.  The precise identity of the Russian Bonaparte cannot be predicted, and is an  entirely secondary question. If Yeltsin finally decides to call off the  election and rule by decree, he might attempt to occupy this position himself,  or it may fall to some unknown general. Such combinations have an accidental  character. The underlying class mechanics do not.</p>
<p>
The only question would  then be: which direction would such a regime take? Lebed himself has made  contradictory statements (which you would expect from a Bonapartist demagogue),  but has said that he admires the Pinochet model. This has a certain logic. The  only way capitalism might be consolidated in Russia is precisely under the heel  of a ferocious military dictatorship which would ruthlessly reduce wages in order  to reinvest the surplus. This is what occurred in Brazil under the military  regime. But given the enormous weight of the Russian working class, such a  regime would be neither stable nor long lasting. After the initial inertia wore  off, within a few years, Russia would be facing a new October.</p>
<p>
A Bonapartist regime in  Russia would have to take measures against the Mafia which is swallowing a huge  proportion of the productive resources. But it is impossible to say where the  Mafia ends and the capitalist class begins! In reality, they are one and the  same thing. Any serious attempt to clamp down on the criminal element would  involve an attack on the nascent bourgeoisie it self. This may well lead to  violent clashes, and even civil war. The outcome of such a struggle would  ultimately determine the direction in which Russia moves.</p>
<p>
The above scenario is not  the only possibility. It is by no means certain that a military regime in  Russia would go down the capitalist road. Even Lebed might say one thing and do  something quite different. A lot will depend on the world situation. A recovery  of the capitalist economy would lend an impetus to the pro-capitalist  tendencies. A downturn would have the opposite effect. The second variant is  far more likely. The US economy is already showing signs of slowing down. Most  likely there will be a new recession in the next two years or so, although it  is impossible to be precise about the timing. However, the outlook for a  capitalist regime in Russia, given the present world situation, does not look  bright. One thing is abundantly clear. There is no possibility of establishing  a stable, democratic capitalist regime in Russia.</p>
<p>
In any event, a regime  dominated by the military wing of the bureaucracy would be strongly tempted to  move in the direction of recentralising the economy. The breakdown of central  planning has had the most harmful effects at all levels, including the army&rsquo;s  supplies and pay. The miserable performance of the Russian army in Chechnya was  itself a devastating comment on the poor morale of the armed forces. Under  certain conditions, it is quite possible that the generals will decide that the  &ldquo;free market&rdquo; offers no future either for them as a privileged caste or for the  Russian nation, in whose name they purport to speak. Any move to crush the  criminal bourgeoisie would count on the enthusiastic support of the working  class, including those sections which previously had illusions in capitalism.</p>
<p>
The only way in which  Zyuganov could defeat the mass of bourgeois gangsters is by appealing to the  working class. The main reason why it is impossible to re-establish a  Stalinist dictatorship of the old kind is that the bureaucracy is faced with an  entirely different working class. This is not the weak, exhausted, illiterate working class of 1922-29, but a powerful industrial proletariat with a relatively  high cultural level. For this reason, a neo-Stalinist regime in Russia would  necessarily have a weak and unstable character. Within a few years, there would  be a new movement of the working class, this time free from any illusions in  capitalism, in the direction of the political revolution. On the basis of  experience, the Russian workers would soon rediscover the traditions of the  past&#8212;the spotless traditions of workers&rsquo; democracy and  internationalism which alone provide the answer for the problems of the working  class in Russia and on a world scale.</p>
<p>
It is impossible to  reconstruct the Stalinist regime of the past in Russia. That was based on a  huge army of spies and informers that no longer exists. Trotsky explained that  a dictatorial regime based only on the army and police cannot be stable. The  recentralisation of the economy, and the repression of the criminal elements,  would undoubtedly act as a stimulus to production in the short run, giving the  regime a breathing space. But in the absence of a workers&rsquo; democracy, they  would soon find themselves faced with the same problems as before: rampant  corruption, inefficiency and bureaucracy. </p>
<p>A Stalinist regime which is  compelled to base itself on the working class would be more similar to the  regime of 1923-30. In the early period, Stalin could lean on the working class  at various times. But now the situation is different. The proletariat is  massively stronger. Moreover, it is an aroused working class, which has passed  through the experience of a totalitarian regime and has no wish to go back.  Under these circumstances, the bureaucracy would not be able to maintain itself  in power for long.</p>
<p>
The class balance of forces  would be entirely different to the past, when Stalin was able to maintain  himself in power by balancing between the working class, the peasantry and the  bureaucracy, leaning on different layers at different times. Under modern  conditions, a Stalinist regime would be a regime of crisis. Very rapidly, the  workers would see the stultifying role of the bureaucracy and move to overthrow  it and establish a regime of genuine workers democracy. </p>
<p>
The outcome would partly  depend on events on an international scale and the world balance of forces. In  any event, Zyuganov would not have a happy time. Unlike Stalin, he would not be  able to totalitarianise the state without the resistance of the working class,  the trade unions, and the rank-and-file of the Communist Party. To this extent,  the scenario would be far more akin to the situation which Trotsky envisaged in  the early 1920s, but without a mass peasantry and in a far more favourable  situation for the working class.</p>
<p>
Once the Russian workers  move to take power, the bureaucracy would be paralysed. Under such conditions,  the transfer of power might be relatively painless. In that event, world  imperialism would be shaken to its foundations. Far from contemplating armed  intervention, as in 1918-20, they would be faced with mass movements of the  working class at home. A successful revolution in Russia would have a far more  electrifying effect than the October Revolution, because of the world crisis of  capitalism, and the changed class relationship of forces in the advanced capitalist  countries and the Third World. It would immediately lead to the collapse of the  rotten and degenerate right wing reformists. The Left would take over  everywhere, preparing the way for the creation of genuine mass revolutionary  currents and parties. Thus, a victory of the Russian working class this time  would be inevitably the prelude to world revolution.</p>
<p>
It is not possible at this  stage to be categorical about how the situation will resolve itself. But one  thing is clear&#8212;Russia has entered into a new period of storm and  stress, the outcome of which will have a decisive effect on the history of the  world. The land of October is once more a decisive factor in the world revolution.</p>
