  Almost daily the capitalist press is filled with stories of trials 
  and shootings in Russia, of new economic and political difficulties which are 
  facing the rulers of Russia, especially in the field of agriculture and culture. 
  What is the truth behind these stories? What is the meaning of these developments?
</p>
<p>
  At a time when economic developments in the capitalist world are at best that 
  of relatively slow economic progress, the emphasis on the economic difficulties 
  of the Soviet Union is compounded of envy and malice. Despite all the difficulties 
  the Soviet Union is advancing at the rate of a steady rhythm of 10 per cent 
  per year at a time when her giant rival America even in the best periods of 
  economic growth can only manage 3.5 per cent and is even then faced with chronic 
  under utilisation of capacity. Even in times of heightened economic activity 
  America can only use her industrial capacity to the extent of 70 to 75 per cent. 
  In agriculture there is a chronic &#8216;surplus&#8217; of capacity.
</p>
<h4>
  Capitalism outstripped
</h4>
<p class="fst">
  Capitalist apologists have abandoned all the old arguments in favour of &#8220;free 
  enterprise&#8221; and even the Tories speak of a &#8220;plan&#8221; of production. 
  This is because in economic terms the decisive superiority of a plan of production 
  over the unplanned and chaotic haphazard growth of capitalism has been demonstrated 
  once and for all in the Soviet Union. In the field of education, science and 
  technique capitalism finds itself overhauled and in many fields outstripped 
  by the formerly backward Soviet Union. There is no need for any Socialist to 
  &#8216;apologise&#8217; for the results of nationalisation of the industry and 
  resources of Russia.
</p>
<p>
  In the past four years 3 times as much has been invested in industry as in the 
  whole period of 22 years before Russia was involved in the war. In some fields 
  Russia has outstripped America. In Magnitogorsk the biggest iron and steel combine 
  in the world has achieved the world&#8217;s highest labour productivity, 50 
  per cent higher than that of the best steel factories in America. At the same 
  time Kruschev complains of the colossal waste in engineering. 1/5th of all ferrous 
  metal used is turned into scrap, partly because of the bad methods used! The 
  contrasts are endless. The picture is a contradictory one. Because of the bureaucratic 
  control there is enormous and unnecessary waste. Because of the over-extension 
  of resources a lathe factory being built in Ivanovo&#8212;has remained uncompleted 
  for 11 years! The big machine building plants nearly all have their own foundries 
  and shops producing their own instruments. Among other reasons this is because 
  of the fear of each bureaucrat of delays in executing orders which will hold 
  up production in the factory he is managing. This is enormously inefficient, 
  wasteful and costly&#8230; However 7 specialised foundries were to be built 
  in 1962&#8230; None were completed! 1.5 billion rubles of equipment have accumulated 
  but cannot be installed because the buildings have not been completed!
</p>
<h4>
  Control from top
</h4>
<p class="fst">
  All these contradictions are the result of bureaucratic control from the top. 
  This in turn provokes corruption at the top and cynicism at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
  Despite dazzling successes, Pravda, Izvestia and the provincial press of Russia 
  continue to denounce corruption, embezzling, malfeasance, nepotism, embezzling, 
  abuse of power in a whole series of industries and towns stretching from one 
  end of the vast Soviet Union to the other! For example in April Bobodzhanov, 
  Mayor of Dushanbe, capital of the Soviet Asian Republic of Tadjikistan, was 
  shot for corruption. The former local Party Secretary Khasanov and the former 
  city prosecutor Hussanov were sentenced to various prison sentences for the 
  same crime.
</p>
<h4>
  &#8220;Swindlers and hooligans&#8221;
</h4>
<p class="fst">
  The Russian press has become almost hysterical in denouncing corruption in high 
  places. People are asked to watch for and denounce those who live &#8220;on 
  a grand scale without being employed anywhere.&#8221; Kruschev has denounced 
  &#8220;&#8230;swindlers, thieves, hooligans, criminals&#8230;&#8221; who are 
  infesting Russian society. The seriousness of the situation is demonstrated 
  by the drastic penalties. While at peace the drastic measures of a state of 
  siege are being imposed.
</p>
<h4>
  Something wrong
</h4>
<p class="fst">
  That 46 years after the Russian revolution such measures have to be taken indicate 
  that there is something wrong. At a time when Kruschev and his apologists in 
  this country are boasting that Russia is &#8220;advancing towards Communism&#8221; 
  these drastic measures expose their falsity. At the same time Kruschev's recent 
  economic measures indicate a frantic zigzag in the policies of Russia&#8217;s 
  rulers. After denouncing the fantastic centralisation of the economy in the 
  Stalin period, which resulted in enormous losses and threatened the virtual 
  seizing-up of the economy, Kruschev announced the de-centralisation of the economy. 
  This was intended to facilitate its development. As Socialist Fight predicted 
  it resulted, instead of one bureaucracy with its fountainhead in Moscow, in 
  16 bureaucracies, in the 16 areas into which the country was divided. At first 
  giving an impetus to the development of production by allowing a certain amount 
  of initiative to the local bureaucrats it soon hampered the economy as much 
  as the former system, by allowing the development of untrammelled bureaucracy 
  in each centre.
</p>
<p>
  Without control and a check there was even more bureaucracy and corruption than 
  previously. Lifted from the fear of the extreme police state of Stalin, the 
  local bureaucrats tended to exceed all bounds in their corruption and plunder 
  of the economy in their own interests.
</p>
<p>
  This threatened to have more catastrophic consequences than even the extreme 
  centralisation of Stalin. Consequently the leadership of the bureaucracy has 
  been compelled to re-centralise the economy now under the direct control of 
  the Communist Party itself.
</p>
<p>
  Kruschev like Stalin before him has not been above using thinly veiled anti-Semitic 
  themes to distract the attention of the masses from the crimes of the bureaucratic 
  leadership. In the trials for corruption stress has been put in the press on 
  those involving bureaucrats of Jewish origin. Thus the corruption is given an 
  anti-Jewish slant.
</p>
<p>
  The blows at the most shameless unbridled and greedy bureaucrats who are made 
  scapegoats for the whole undemocratic regime and methods have not prevented 
  the Kruschev leadership from also threatening reprisals against the workers. 
  In this too, although on a very much milder scale, the bureaucracy is returning 
  to the methods of Stalin. Kruschev advocated that there should be &#8220;extra 
  leave given for those who work well and reduced leave or none at all for those 
  who do not&#8230;&#8221; In theory this would be a violation of the rights allegedly 
  guaranteed to the workers by the new constitution. In practice it is only the 
  passive resistance of the workers in the factories which can prevent this being 
  put into practice. By this resort to a milder version of Stakhanovism it is 
  also intended to split the workers, if it could be carried out. In practice 
  it would be difficult to do so especially in the big factories employing tens 
  of thousands of workers. Most probably it will be used merely to give &#8216;extra 
  leave&#8217; to the blue-eyed boys without affecting the rights of the workers 
  as a whole. The working class is in a different condition and different mood 
  to the past. It has enormously increased in numbers, power, and cohesion. Thus 
  this new zigzag of repression, following on previous concessions will not reach 
  the same depth of insanity as in the blood purges of the past.
</p>
<h4>
  Oppositional moods
</h4>
<p class="fst">
  At the same time the bureaucracy is endeavouring to tighten up all round. The 
  workers and peasants have been emboldened by the Kruschev reforms and as always 
  the first effects are felt in the field of culture among the intelligentsia, 
  who reflect the mood of opposition among the people. The freer atmosphere had 
  encouraged critical thought and even disguised opposition among the poets, writers 
  and artists. The fact that 12,000 people could attend a poetry reading is an 
  indication of tendencies among the youth. Consequently recognising this danger 
  Kruschev and the bureaucracy have cracked down and demanded complete conformity 
  with the policy of the &#8220;Party&#8221; i.e. of the interests of the millions 
  of bureaucrats. As Kruschev announced &#8220;The Party Central Committee will 
  insist that all, from the most justly esteemed and famous worker in literature 
  or art to the young beginner, shall adhere firmly to the party line.&#8221;
</p>
<h4>
  Cultural crisis
</h4>
<p class="fst">
  There is a connection between the measures on the economic field and the steps 
  taken on the cultural front. They indicate the crisis which is facing the Stalinist 
  regime. It is true that the worst excesses of Stalinism such as the slave camps 
  and the unbridled terror have disappeared. But on a higher economic level the 
  Kruschev regime faces the same crisis as Stalin. In 1936 Stalin introduced the 
  &#8220;most democratic constitution in the world.&#8221; This was intended as 
  a check on the worst excesses of the ruling officialdom in the Soviet Union. 
  Far from succeeding in its purpose it ushered in the terrible blood purges. 
  Similarly the reforms of Kruschev have not solved the problems of Russian society. 
  As one thoughtful student remarked to a correspondent of the Times, &#8220;Only 
  the leadership has changed while the system which permitted the aberration of 
  Stalinism has remained intact, with no constitutional guarantees to prevent 
  a relapse&#8230;&#8221;
</p>
<h4>
  Plagiarising Stalin
</h4>
<p class="fst">
  It is also interesting that this crisis takes place, again plagiarising Stalin, 
  after the introduction of a new constitution &#8220;the most democratic in the 
  world.&#8221; Similar causes have produced similar results. Stalin&#8217;s &#8216;constitution&#8217; 
  was meant as a reassurance to the workers without changing anything fundamentally. 
  It was meant as a whip against bureaucracy. So with Kruschev&#8217;s.
</p>
<h4>
  Corruption rampant
</h4>
<p class="fst">
  Hooliganism at the top of society in the form of corruption, teddy-boyism reflecting 
  hooliganism in the bottom layers of society, are symptoms that something is 
  fundamentally wrong. Kruschev declared: 
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
  &#8220;Individual representatives of the creative intelligentsia have come to 
  wrong conclusions in approaching the work done by the party in overcoming the 
  harmful effects of the Stalin personality cult.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
  &#8220;They have failed to understand that the struggle against the cult of 
  personality does not at all mean any relaxation of leadership, of organised 
  administration of state and public life in the country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  This means that fundamentally the system will remain as formerly. Yet with the 
  tremendous development of the Russian economy all excuses used by Stalin of 
  the danger of the restoration of capitalism have been rendered ridiculous. The 
  remnants of the old ruling class in Russia have been absorbed into the bureaucracy 
  itself. There have been two generations of people born since the revolution. 
  Yet there is less freedom than existed in the poor and weak Soviet Union, fighting 
  a civil war and intervention from the imperialist states in 1917-1920.
</p>
<p>
  Under Lenin and Trotsky despite bureaucratic excesses and deformations Soviet 
  democracy, discussion and control by the workers and peasants existed. Kruschev 
  claims that Russia is approaching Communism. Today Russia is one of the two 
  most powerful nations on earth. Yet the same measure of freedom is not allowed. 
  Why?
</p>
<p>
  The economic and cultural difficulties of the Soviet Union re fleet the fact 
  that the officialdom&#8212;millions of officials of party, state and the managers 
  of the economy&#8212;are not prepared to give up control of the economy which 
  they usurped under Stalin. This is the source of the privileges, power and inflated 
  standard of living of this ruling group. But Socialism requires the full participation 
  and control of the mass of the people in state, and economy. Lenin had expected 
  the state and all measures of repression to begin to wither away immediately 
  on the workers taking power. Instead of that we have Kruschev underlining the 
  power of the state and its separateness from the people.
</p>
<h4>
  Inequality reigns
</h4>
<p class="fst">
  All excuses for a repressive apparatus have disappeared. But inequality remains. 
  It is to guard this that the Kruschev regime insists on maintaining totalitarian 
  control intact.
</p>
<p>
  The first measures of a transition to socialism require the fullest democracy. 
  The conditions for a healthy workers state worked out by Marx and Lenin were 
  summed up by Lenin in State and Revolution. These were:
</p>
<ol class="numbered">
  <li>Soviets with right of election and recall of all representatives. (Complete 
  democracy and full freedom for all tendencies within the working class)</li>
  <li>No official to receive a higher wage than a skilled worker.</li>
  <li>No standing army but an armed people.</li>
  <li>No permanent bureaucracy. Each to do the job of &#8220;accounting and control&#8221; 
  in turn. &#8220;Every cook should be able to be prime minister.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>
  These were the ideal which Lenin put forward. Yet in the mighty Soviet Union 
  today none of them exists at the present time. That is the explanation of the 
  economic difficulties. That is the explanation of the corruption. That is the 
  explanation of the cultural crisis.
</p>
<h4>
  Political revolution
</h4>
<p class="fst">
  All the measures of the bureaucracy cannot prevent colossal waste, mismanagement 
  and red tape in the economy. All the measures cannot prevent the corruption 
  of an uncontrolled officialdom at the top.
</p>
<p>
  In its turn it cannot prevent the development of opposition. The intellectual 
  crisis is similar to the one that prevailed in Hungary which was the harbinger 
  of the political revolution there. The reforms of Kruschev at the top to prevent 
  revolution from below will inevitably fail in their purpose. The new generation 
  which is growing up in the Soviet Union in the coming years will overthrow the 
  bureaucracy while maintaining the conquests of the revolution. They will restore 
  the workers democracy of Lenin and Trotsky, through political revolution but 
  on a higher economic and cultural foundation.
