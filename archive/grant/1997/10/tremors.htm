<p>On Monday 27th October  the stock markets of the world were shaken by a sudden collapse in share  prices. The chaotic scenes on world&rsquo;s stock exchanges exactly ten years after &ldquo;Black  Monday&rdquo; caused a general panic in financial and government circles, barely concealed  by appeals for calm. What was the meaning of these events? And what do they  mean for the future? Do they herald the onset of an economic collapse like the  notorious Wall Street crash of 1929? Or is it just a minor &ldquo;correction&rdquo; as the  apologists of capitalism maintain? The answers to these questions will  decisively affect the lives and living standards of every man, woman and child  on the planet. The purpose of this document is to provide the answers. </p>
<h4>A Global Crisis</h4>
<p>
The main thing to note is  that this was a truly global crisis. In the space of two weeks the stock  markets crashed one after the other like a row of dominoes. In New Zealand, the  first market to start trading after Wall Street closed, share prices tumbled by  almost 10 per cent by the end of the morning&rsquo;s trading. In Sydney, the blue  chip index plunged by 7 per cent at the opening. The falls were severe,  especially in Asia and the so-called &ldquo;emerging&rdquo; economies of Latin America.  Hours after markets in Hong Kong resumed a plunge that has triggered a  worldwide sell-off, the Mexican stock market suspended trade twice and then  shut down for the day after falling 13.3%, its sixth-largest drop ever. The  Mexican peso also plummeted nearly 10% against the dollar after two years of  comparatively stable exchange rates. Brazil&rsquo;s Bovespa index took the worst  pounding in the region, falling 15%. It was the steepest one-day decline in  five years for the largest of Latin America&rsquo;s emerging markets. Like many of  the Asian markets that have been ravaged in recent weeks, Brazil also has a  substantial current-account deficit. The Argentine Merval index closed 13.7%  lower, and the Buenos Aires exchange halted trade on 17 of the 32 shares on the  index. Thus, the first effect of the crisis is to place a large question mark  over the lives of millions of poor people in the so-called Third World. These  people have been promised the hope of a better future through hard work and &ldquo;private  enterprise&rdquo; thanks to the wonders of the &ldquo;market&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
Similar promises have been  made to the people of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, which remains  in the grip of a deep slump after seven years of &ldquo;market reform&rdquo; accompanied by  an economic catastrophe with no historical parallel in times of peace. In the  space of six years, the Russian economy has collapsed by a staggering 60%. The  mass of the population have been reduced to beggary. There are 2,2 million  cases of tuberculosis, a disease linked directly to poverty and malnutrition.  These are some of the joys bestowed on the Russian people by &ldquo;free market  economics.&rdquo; Even in Eastern Europe, where the economy seemed to be picking up  after a similar collapse, there is the beginnings of a new crisis in the Czech  Republic, the strongest of these economies, and a slowdown in the others. The  latest stock exchange crash has placed a dark cloud over Eastern Europe also.</p>
<p>
But it was in Asia that the  financial crash started, and has had its most dramatic consequences. It was  initially triggered by international currency speculators taking bets against  the Thai baht. Thailand, not long ago regarded as an &ldquo;Asian tiger&rdquo; was  considered to be an easy target by the big international speculators who make  fortunes by gambling on the money market like a gigantic global casino. Bangkok  was coerced to consider raising interest rates to stem the outflow of foreign  capital. But the baht quickly fell, followed by a host of finance houses  overwhelmed by a mountain of bad debt. Once the run started it was unstoppable.  The speculators walked away with an estimated $30bn in their pockets and an  appetite for more. Here we have the reality of the &ldquo;free enterprise system&rdquo;! A  gang of speculators armed with huge quantities of money decide that the economy  of a given country is not as fit as it should be, and begin to unload its  currency, forcing it to devalue. This is a highly profitable enterprise,  enabling these gentlemen to &ldquo;earn&rdquo; billions of dollars without producing  anything, just by lifting up a telephone. What better proof can one ask of the  parasitic nature of present-day capitalism? According to the United Nations,  the real figure for world unemployment and underemployment (including millions  who eke out a living selling things on street corners and the like) amounts to  no fewer than one thousand million people. At least one hundred million  children are born, live and die on the streets without ever having a roof over  their head, and the same number have no school. Yet the personal wealth of the  richest ten people in the world would be sufficient to solve the problem of  world poverty. Such is the real situation of the world in the last decade of  the twentieth century. </p>
<p>
According to the  fashionable economic theory (&ldquo;trickle-down&rdquo;), all that is required is to allow  the rich to get richer and the poor will automatically benefit. From this  standpoint, the activities of financial speculators ought to be encouraged, as  sooner or later it will lead to a healthy and thriving economy in which  everyone will benefit. This &ldquo;theory&rdquo; has aptly been described by the American  economist J. K. Galbraith as the idea that the rich do not have enough money  and the poor have too much! In reality monetarist economics is an expression of  the fact that for a whole period after 1945, the capitalist system went beyond  its limits and now has to pull back, returning to a more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; capitalism,  characterised by no state intervention, no welfare state, and , supposedly, &ldquo;sound  finance&rdquo; and a &ldquo;strong currency&rdquo;. In pursuit of this chimera, Thatcher not only  liquidated large parts of the welfare state, but also destroyed one quarter of  Britain&rsquo;s manufacturing industry. Britain has been increasingly turned into a  parasitic rentier economy, dominated by the City of London, that is to say by  banking and finance capital, the most degenerate and parasitic section of the  ruling class. It is this section that is most enthusiastic in its pursuit of  speculative gain, presented under the label of &ldquo;liberalisation&rdquo;, &ldquo;globalisation&rdquo;  and, of course, &ldquo;free enterprise&rdquo;. The recent events provides us with a  text-book example of how it operates.</p>
<p>
A glance at the national  debt figures shows that, under the surface, all was not well with the &ldquo;tigers&rdquo;.  In 1995, Thailand&rsquo;s external debt was equivalent to more than one-third of  gross national product. In Indonesia it amounted to more than one-half, in the  Philippines to almost one-half and in Malaysia to almost 40 per cent. These  countries desperately needed foreign funds to service the debt but they could  only be attracted by high interest rates which, in turn, would hold back  economic growth. As long as these economies were achieving rates of economic  growth in double digits and their stock markets were booming. the warning signs  could be ignored. &ldquo;Confidence&rdquo; reigned supreme. But In fact the values in the  stock exchange were inflated. Already in 1995, all the stock markets of the  Asian countries were trading on price/earnings ratios averaging well over 20  times the earnings of the listed companies. While publicly maintaining the hype  about the &ldquo;tigers&rdquo;, inside the boardrooms of the big banks and monopolies, the  comments were increasingly pessimistic. As one observer put it:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;More and more money men  suddenly realised than Asian stock markets should not have been booming for the  past two years,&rdquo; said Hans Briens, senior consultant for the Hong Kong-based  Political and Economic Risk Consultancy. &ldquo;They suddenly realised that these  economies are not so strong and they are filled with a lot of corruption,  nepotism, inadequate banking systems, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Having brought Thailand to  its knees, the men of money looked around for other targets close at hand.  These were not hard to find. Paradoxically, the stock market and the currency  which suffered most was Hong Kong, despite the fact that this was the one place  in the region with &ldquo;no big problems of indebtedness and a stock market rather  conservatively trading in line with the collective corporate strength of its  component parts. It was this very strength that caused the problem. Alone among  stock markets, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange had the liquidity, and until just  over a week ago, the strength, to be used as a milk cow for fund managers  scrambling to get together the cash to pay off investors who wanted to get out  of the region.&rdquo; (The Independent, 28/10/97.)</p>
<p>
This shows the insane  character of capitalism. The big monopolies (the &ldquo;speculators&rdquo;) use their  muscle to bring down a currency which they regard as weak, and even undermine  an economy like that of Hong Kong which, by capitalist criteria, is supposed to  be &ldquo;sound&rdquo;. They act like predatory vultures or ravening wolves thirsting for  easy profits. In the words of one of the currency speculators: &ldquo;we were like  wolves on the ridgeline, looking down on a herd of elk.&rdquo; This is how the  destinies of millions of people are daily disposed of under capitalism!</p>
<p>
The panic which spread with  lightening speed to Stock markets around the world was caused by the attempt of  Hong Kong&rsquo;s Monetary Authority to defend the HK dollar against speculators,  leading to a collapse in the former colony&rsquo;s stock market. Shares around the  world followed Hong Kong down, with the emerging markets of Latin America hit  hardest last night as investors flew from what became transformed from &ldquo;emerging  markets&rdquo; into a risky proposition. These gyrations on the stock exchange is an  expression of the underlying nervousness of the bourgeoisie. Once the  speculative mania is set in motion, nothing can stop it: &ldquo;&lsquo;What we are seeing  is a huge balloon jabbed from every angle,&rsquo; Edmond Warner, head of global strategy  at NatWest Securities, said. &lsquo;Hong Kong might have been smoothed but for the  fact that it comes straight after Thailand and Malaysia. In the US we have the  real fear of higher interest rates and we have the big, high-fashion technology  stocks, with stratospheric ratings being pummelled. In the UK we have confusion  over EMU. We have contagion.&rsquo; (The Guardian, 28/10/97, our emphasis.)</p>
<h4>
  <strong>Bourgeois Can&rsquo;t Explain</strong> </h4>
<p>
Bourgeois economists,  powerless to explain the real economic processes, resort to meaningless expressions  which explain nothing at all. It is supposed to be all a matter of &ldquo;confidence&rdquo;&#8212;as  if this was something entirely separate from the real economy, to be shaped at  will by skilful politicians and bankers. They do not wish to accept that crises  are an inevitable product of the capitalist system, and therefore attribute  them to entirely subjective phenomena taking place in the minds of investors.  in reality, in however distorted a way, even a stock exchange crisis is an  expression of objective processes taking place in the real economy.</p>
<p>
In an indirect way, Alan  Greenspan admitted that the crisis in Hong Kong was not the cause of the panic,  but only an accidental phenomenon:</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mr Greenspan said that  declines in confidence in the [Asian] region do have some direct effect on US  corporate profits, but not enough to explain the recent behaviour of the US  financial markets. If it had not been for developments in South-east Asia, the  Fed chief declared, something else would have triggered a re-evaluation&rdquo; (The  Guardian, 30/10/97) In other words, the real cause of these events must be  sought elsewhere. But where?</p>
<p>
To answer this question, we  must proceed from fundamental considerations. In a broad historical sense, the  capitalist system had already ceased to play a progressive role even before the  First World War. However, as Lenin and Trotsky explained many times, until it  is overthrown by the working class, the capitalist system will always find a &ldquo;way  out&rdquo; of the crises which it inevitably engenders. There is no such thing as a &ldquo;final  crisis&rdquo; of capitalism in that sense. For reasons already explained by our  tendency (see <a href="../../1960/slump.htm">&ldquo;Will There be a Slump?&rdquo;</a>), capitalism experienced a new period of  upswing following World War Two which lasted for a generation, at least in the  advanced capitalist countries. This fact set its stamp on the relations between  the classes and the psychology of the working class of Europe, the USA and  Japan for a whole period.</p>
<p>
In reality, in this period,  the capitalist system went beyond its own limits, through credit, indebtedness,  Keynesian deficit financing and so on, and in particular through the  development of world trade which partially and for a temporary period permitted  the bourgeois to overcome the limits of the nation state. However, we now enter  into a new and very different period, a period of storm and stress and  convulsive crises in the economy, society and politics. All the factors that  combined to produce the upward spiral of growth will dialectically turn into  their opposite. Above all world trade, which acted as a powerful spur to growth  and investment, no longer has the same effect, as we pointed out in a previous  document (&ldquo;A New Stage in the World Revolution&rdquo;). Everywhere the capitalists  are attempting to claw back the reforms of the past, cutting state expenditure  and attempting to establish balanced budgets. They understand that, to continue  down the old Keynesian road, they would be faced with an explosion of  inflation. That is the reason why, despite all the propaganda that &ldquo;inflation  has been defeated&rdquo;, they remain terrified of inflation. However, the policy of  slashing state expenditure only creates new problems, since it also signifies  cutting the domestic market, thus paving the way for even deeper slumps in the  future. Thus, the bourgeoisie is trapped on the horns of an insoluble dilemma.  Whereas in the period of upswing, whatever mistakes they made did not matter,  now whatever they do will be wrong. We are thus faced with a prolonged period  of capitalist crisis which will inevitably give rise to revolutionary  opportunities in one country after another, as the case of Albania showed.</p>
<h4>
  <strong>Booms and slumps</strong> </h4>
<p>
Nevertheless, the existence  of the organic crisis of capitalism does not mean that always and everywhere  there must be a fall in production. On the contrary. The capitalist system  always moves in a cycle of boom and slump (&ldquo;the business cycle&rdquo;). Recently, it  has become the fashion to assert that the cycle has been abolished. The  advocates of the so-called &ldquo;New Paradigm&rdquo; claim that the present boom in the  USA is based on entirely new phenomena&#8212;information technology, &ldquo;globalisation&rdquo;  and world-wide &ldquo;liberalisation&rdquo;&#8212;which they imagine will lead to permanent  growth on the basis of increased productivity, low wages and interest rates and  little or no inflation. In fact, as the serious bourgeois economists are well  aware, this is just a pipe-dream. The normal cycle of capitalism is alive and  well, and about to take its revenge on the doubters. The present gyrations on  the stock exchanges are merely a reminder of this fact, like the first tremors  which presage an earthquake.</p>
<p>
The present cycle has  already lasted seven years in the USA. This is quite long by post-war  standards. Actually, the length of the cycle of boom and slumps is historically  rather elastic and has varied at different times. In Marx&rsquo;s day it was a  ten-year cycle. However, it was shortened in the post-war period to about five  or six years. The last cycle lasted a little over seven years. There is  therefore reason to suppose that the present cycle will not continue much  longer, despite indications to the contrary.</p>
<p>
At the peak of every cycle,  the mood of the bourgeois is always characterised by wild euphoria. They begin  to believe that the boom can really go on forever. Expressions to this effect  are usually most prolific just before a collapse. The prospect of big profits,  especially from speculative activity, creates a wave of greed which engulfs  even the most &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; bankers and holders of pension funds. They then throw  caution to the wind and plunge into the carnival of speculation like a drunken  man, with no thought for the future. Such events always end up in the same way,  with a collapse. After each collapse, they swear they will learn the lesson &ldquo;next  time&rdquo;, like a drunk with a bad head the morning after. But all history proves  that they never learn anything. The present situation shows just that.</p>
<p>
The USA over the past seven  years has managed to achieve a relatively high rate of growth&#8212;partly at the  expense of the working class and partly at the expense of its rivals. But the  feverish increase in share prices on Wall Street was out of all proportion to  the growth of the real economy. For almost a year now, Alan Greenspan, chairman  of the Federal Reserve, has been warning of &lsquo;irrational exuberance&rsquo; on Wall  Street, but financial markets have continued to rise strongly around the world,  ignoring growing evidence of a dangerous speculative bubble in the making.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Some market pundits have  argued that a &lsquo;new paradigm&rsquo; has come into effect in the world economy, led by  advances in technology, globalisation and productivity, to justify the sort of  sky-high valuations which have become the norm on Wall Street and in some other  markets.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;This was strongly rejected  by Mr Greenspan in a recent testimony to the House of Representatives, in which  he intimated that it was foolish to believe the normal rules of supply and  demand had been suspended.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;If yesterday&rsquo;s sharp fall  in stock markets around the world translates into a more general collapse in  investment confidence, it would have serious repercussions for the world  economy. The extent to which this happens largely depends on how much of the  speculative gains of the past few years have been financed by debt. With  interest rates at near record lows in the US, and the stock market rising  strongly, there was every incentive to borrow to invest.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;In the most frightening of  scenarios, a significant part of the recent gain on Wall Street would have been  fed by borrowed money; the resulting negative equity could lead to a string of  collapses and a credit squeeze. If the stock market fall continues, there is  bound to be a knock-on effect to consumer confidence.&rdquo; (The Independent,  28/10/97.)</p>
<p>
When Greenspan issued  warning, the value of shares on the Dow Jones was a record 5,000. At the time  of the crisis it had reached an astonishing 8,200. Such a staggering piling up  of paper &ldquo;values&rdquo; bears no relation whatever to the real growth of the US  economy. A stock exchange collapse was therefore rooted in the situation. This  actually occurred on Monday the 27th of October, although it was preceded by a  series of spectacular crashes in Asia, which reflected the fact that the period  of rapid economic growth in that area was reaching its limits. This in itself  is an extremely important element in the equation. It underlines the fact that  the crises in the stock exchange are not entirely inexplicable events motivated  by subjective elements, but are, in the last analysis, symptomatic of processes  unfolding in the real economy.</p>
<h4>
  <strong>What sort of Crisis?</strong> </h4>
<p>
In Capital vol. 3, (chapt.  30) Marx explains that &ldquo;The last cause of all real crises always remains the  poverty and restricted consumption of the masses as compared to the tendency of  capitalist production to develop the productive forces in such a way that only  the absolute power of consumption of society would be their limit&rdquo; Thus, the  final cause of the crisis of capitalism is over-production and the limited  purchasing power of the masses. But there are crises and crises. That is why  Marx refers to &ldquo;every real crisis.&rdquo; In actual fact, the line of capitalist  development can be broken at any number of different places, and there are all  kinds of crises, including crises in the stock exchange which are not directly caused  by the central contradictions of the mode of production. Moreover, not every  crisis on the stock exchange leads directly to recession.</p>
<p>
The classic case of the  latter was the Wall Street crash of 1929. In this case, all the conditions had  been prepared for a slump, and the stock exchange crisis acted as a powerful  detonator for the general collapse. However, that is not always the case. For  example, the stock exchange crisis of 1920 served to squeeze out a large amount  of fictitious capital that had been accumulated during the First World War and  the inflationary boom that immediately followed it. This is what the bourgeois  economists mean by a &ldquo;correction&rdquo;. Depending on the given situation, such a &ldquo;correction&rdquo;  can even play a positive role and act as a spur to a further development of the  economy, as actually occurred in the 1920s. Something similar happened after  the stock exchange crisis of October 1987. It is therefore necessary to take  the recent events in context and deal with the processes at work in the real  economy.</p>
<p>
One of the most striking  features of the present cycle is the staggering amounts of fictitious capital  that has been injected into the system. Trillions of dollars are floating  around the world, not for productive purposes but for speculation. The last few  weeks have shown how these colossal sums ca be brought to bear on, say, the  currency of a particular economy which is perceived to be weak and a  devaluation can be forced by massive selling. This is just what occurred with  the Thai baht, provoking a series of crises and devaluations in other Asian  economies in a chain reaction which eventually provoked a wave of panic selling  in stock exchanges in the USA and Europe. Thus, the much-vaunted &ldquo;globalisation&rdquo;  of the financial system turns out to be the source of new contradictions and  instability, and one that can easily spark off a massive financial crises on  the lines of 1929 or worse, with unforeseen consequences for the world economy.  The recent developments were only a little foretaste of what the future has in  store.</p>
<p>
Marx explained that the  ideal of the bourgeois was the notion of obtaining surplus value from thin air,  of &ldquo;money begetting money&rdquo; (M&#8212;M), without the painful necessity of resorting  to production. In the modern epoch, they have done their best to realise this  dream through massive and unparalleled speculation, and not only on the stock  exchange. We have the spectacle of the looting of state assets through &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo;.  By these means the bourgeois obtain valuable utilities for trivial sums of  money which they then proceed to milk for profit, spending little or nothing on  new investment. On the other hand we have an unprecedented spate of take-overs,  indicating that the process of concentration of capital predicted by Marx has  reached unheard-of limits. These take-overs are also not generally accompanied  by new productive investment, but are invariably followed by closures and  lay-offs.</p>
<p>
The massive increase in  fictitious capital is shown by the incredible inflation of values on the stock  exchange. In the USA the total value of shares ($10,900 trillion) exceeds that  of the US GDP ($8,000 trillion). But sooner or later this process must end in a  massive deflation of share prices in which someone must lose. That someone is  invariably the small investor. The big monopolies will make sure they sell  before the collapse (and usually bring it on by so doing). They even intervene  when markets are falling, to buy up shares at bargain prices. Thus, the small  investor is fleeced, and the big investors gain whether the market is up or  down.</p>
<p>
In 1987, and again in 1990,  they managed to avoid a &ldquo;meltdown&rdquo;, among other reasons because of the  development of the Far Eastern market, especially China. Now, however, the  crisis is affecting Asia. Indeed, the present stock market crisis can be traced  to that very source. Far from being a source of stability, it is the source of  instability. And while the markets in the USA and Europe have managed to stage  a rally (for how long is another question), the crisis in Asia continues with  no sign of relief.</p>
<p>
The main reason why the  1987 crash did not lead immediately to a recession was the fact that the  governments of the main industrial nations combined to inject a large quantity  of liquidity into the economy to prevent it. From the point of view of orthodox  Keynesian economics such conduct was completely irresponsible. The purpose of  deficit financing is to get the economy out of recession, not to keep a boom  going. The result of this policy was a huge amount of indebtedness which they  are now struggling to squeeze out of the system. This partly explains the  enormous national debts that plague all the main capitalist economies&#8212;more  than 60% of GDP in France and Germany, 125% in Italy, 120% in Greece and 130%  in Belgium. The National Debt of Great Britain which had been building up  steadily for 150 years actually doubled in the last four years of the Tory  government. The interest on these debts alone absorbs a huge amount of the  wealth of these countries. Without this, Belgium, for example, would actually  have a surplus. This constitutes an intolerable drain. Moreover, in pursuing  these methods, they only succeeded in delaying the recession for a further two  years. A repeat of this method seems ruled out at the present time. Quite apart  from the fact that it would run counter to the policy of cutting state  expenditure being pursued in all the main capitalist countries, it is not clear  that it would have the desired effect.</p>
<p>
The only country that has  attempted to apply Keynesian methods in the last period is Japan. Under severe  pressure from her rivals, especially the USA, to reflate her economy, Japan has  pumped at least $275 billion into it. Yet the results have been very poor.  Growth remains sluggish, but for the first time since the War, Japan now has a  huge national debt&#8212;predicted to reach Y254 trillion by the end of 1997. If we  add to this the combined debts of local government, the figure climbs to a  staggering Y476 trillion. This is about 92% of the GDP (compared to an average  of about 60% in the USA, Britain, France and Germany). In addition to this,  interest rates are extremely low (only 0.5% in Japan). Since the normal  mechanism for increasing the flow of liquidity is the lowering of interest  rates, it is hard to see how they could use this method to reflate as they did  in 1987 when rates were much higher. In this and other respects the situation  is very different to that of ten years ago. It therefore cannot be taken for  granted that a serious crisis on the stock exchange would end in the same way.</p>
<h4>
  <strong>Peculiarities of the &ldquo;Boom&rdquo;</strong> </h4>
<p>
The present boom has some  peculiar features which have been commented on in earlier material. With the  exception of the boom in information technology in the USA, this cycle has not  been characterised by a great increase in investment in the productive forces.  What little productive there has been has mainly been to cover depreciation.  This is not an accident. The extremely low level of demand everywhere means  that the domestic market has been depressed. this reflects the fact that this  boom has been mainly at the expense of the working class. As William Greider  points out:</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The so-called Clinton boom  is distinctive from earlier cycles because, despite five years of economic  growth, family median income has still not recovered from the last recession.  It&rsquo;s no secret how consumers cope: they borrow to keep buying. Household debt  has reached an astonishing 91 percent of disposable personal income, compared  with 65 percent in 1980, according to the Financial Markets Center. No one  knows at what point the buyers will be tapped out. Consumer debt is being  assumed on punishing terms. Nominal interest rates have declined somewhat, but  real interest rates&#8212;the true cost of credit calculated by nominal rates  discounted for inflation&#8212;are still extraordinarily high, because as nominal  rates subside, the price level keeps falling, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The capitalists have  concentrated on squeezing the last ounce of surplus value from the sweat and  nervous effort of the workers&#8212;what Marx calls relative surplus value. Whereas  in the past the capitalists obtained profits from investing in machinery this  had a relatively progressive character (indeed, it was the only thing that was  progressive about it) it now stands exposed as an entirely degenerate, effete  and reactionary system. However, by holding down wages and purchasing power,  they have also cut the domestic market, creating new contradictions.</p>
<p>
The mania for speculation,  take-overs, looting the state and generally attempting to get &ldquo;something for  nothing&rdquo; is only the other side of the coin of the same phenomenon. It is a  confession of historical bankruptcy. As always, the ruling class finds intellectual  prostitutes ready and willing to find a &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo; justification for this.  Never has the so-called &ldquo;science&rdquo; of bourgeois economics sunk so low as at the  present moment. They are mere apologists for a class that has long ago lost any  right to stand at the helm of society, that is incapable of developing the  productive forces as it did, at least to some extent, in the past. The fall of  Stalinism gave them a temporary access of confidence. but now this is turning  to ashes. The most far-sighted strategists of Capital (a small minority, it is  true) look with foreboding to the future. The majority, as usual, are happy to  indulge themselves in the orgy of money-making like contented pigs around a  sty, oblivious to all warnings. This applies particularly to the  representatives of finance capital who feel themselves to be free and  untrammelled in the new &ldquo;global market&rdquo; that enables them to indulge their  appetite for enrichment without let or restriction. Nevertheless, the present  crisis showed that a nervous mood is beginning to develop even in these  circles. The subsequent rally on Wall Street (almost certainly the result of  the big monopolies buying up cheap shares at the expense of the small investor)  will doubtless convince them that it was all just a false alarm. They may well  go back to their speculative antics as if nothing had happened. That will be a  sufficient guarantee of new and even more catastrophic falls in the next few  months.</p>
<p>
What is the reason for the  underlying nervousness? In recent months there have been a number of articles  in the bourgeois press warning that the present boom could not go on forever.  Stephen Roach has repeatedly warned of the danger of a &ldquo;worker backlash&rdquo;, a  warning given new strength by the victorious UPS strike in the USA this summer.  Clearly, the monstrous squeezing of the workers has its limits. The fact that,  at least in the USA, the boom has eventually acquired a certain vitality has  encouraged the workers to press for higher wages. If we bear in mind that the  real wages of the US workers have not risen for the past 20 years, it is clear  that this situation cannot go on indefinitely. New strikes are inevitable in  the next months, and not only in the USA. In Britain, the election of a Labour  government has created an entirely new situation. The expectations of the  workers are very great, and the right-wing Labour leaders cannot fulfil them.  Here is a ready-made formula for a big movement on the industrial front. A  similar situation exists in France, where the workers have given ample proof of  their militancy. And Italy, Germany and Spain will not be far behind. the stage  is set for one upheaval after another, especially if the economy picks up a bit  in the next few months, which is not ruled out.</p>
<p>
The recent events are a graphic  reminder of the anarchic nature of capitalism. The idea that this can be  controlled by governments and central bankers is nonsense. On the contrary, the  uncontrollable nature of capitalism has never been more apparent than at the  present time. The fact of &ldquo;globalisation&rdquo; merely means that these  uncontrollable forces will be played out on a more gigantic scale than ever  before. Moreover, the unprecedented intensification of the concentration of  capital, where vast amounts of capital (much of it fictitious) are moved about  the world at the caprice of a small number of people, lends the whole process  an even more convulsive and unpredictable character. It is a finished recipe  for massive slumps in the future, which can easily be triggered off by a stock exchange  crash like the one we have just witnessed. The fact that this did not  immediately happen on this occasion does not mean that it will not happen in  the future. On the contrary. The false optimism produced by the present rally  on Wall Street will itself reinforce the tendency to continue as before. This  means that new and even more catastrophic falls are inevitable. If they  coincide with a slowdown in the real economy, a stock exchange panic can easily  be the starting point for a slump. The systematic cutting of the home market  through the reduction of state expenditure, &ldquo;downsizing&rdquo;, attacks on living  standards etc. is preparing the way for a deep slump, probably the deepest  since 1945. Historically, where there has been such a chain of events, it has  not been automatic. There appears to be a delay of six months or even more  between a stock exchange crash and the onset of a slump. The former serves to  announce the latter, just as a tremor announces a serious earthquake. The  present nervousness on world stock markets is thus the first of what will be a  series of tremors which, for anyone with eyes to read, announce the beginning  of the end of the present cycle.</p>
<h4>
  <strong>Information Technology</strong> </h4>
<p>
The stock exchange crisis  in the USA hit the share prices of the information industry particularly hard.  The Nasdaq Composite index&#8212;which tracks many of America&rsquo;s fast growing,  high-technology companies&#8212;slumped more than 10 per cent. This development was  predictable, and predicted, and not only by the Marxists Those who argue that  the business cycle has disappear based themselves on the idea that the advent  of information technology has somehow fundamentally altered the system. This  argument was recently answered in the pages of Business Week (1/3/97) which  published a cover story under the title of &ldquo;The New Business Cycle&rdquo;. Among  other things, the article says:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;But the business cycle has  not disappeared. To the contrary: High technology is more volatile than the  automobile industry, with the biggest swings driven by new technologies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
It quotes Andrew S. Grove,  chief executive at Intel Corp., as saying: &ldquo;Every time we thought something  about our business was less cyclical, the next cycle was bigger than the  earlier one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Actually, there is nothing  new about the present situation. Already in the pages of the Communist  Manifesto, Marx and Engels explain that: &ldquo;The bourgeoisie cannot exist without  constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the  relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society.  Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was on the  contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes.&rdquo;  (MESW, Vol. 1., p.111.)</p>
<p>
It is ABC for any Marxist  that the capitalists must constantly find new and profitable avenues of  investment. In every period of capitalist development there have been such  fields of investments&#8212;steam power and textiles in the industrial revolution;  the railways, steam ships and telegraphs in the last part of the 19th century;  Fordism and automobiles in the 1920s and 1930s; then electricity, aeroplanes,  the radio, telephone, television, chemicals, plastics, computers and so on. In  fact, the relative importance of information technique is far less than, say,  the railways in the last century. From 1869 to 1893, the miles of rail track  quadrupled, and rail shipping costs dropped dramatically, opening up large  parts of the country for manufacturing and commercial agriculture. The  railroads themselves consumed much of the US steel and coal production and  accounted for almost 20% of all investment. Overall, the railroads&rsquo; expansion  fuelled an economy that grew an average of 5% a year.</p>
<p>
The most striking thing  about the present economic cycle is not the opening up of new field of  productive investment, but precisely the lack of it. If one excludes  information technology, the real growth rate of the USA would be a miserable  1.8% per annum. This is really the only sector of the economy which has  experienced a large influx of investment. For this reason, it has become the  decisive sector of the US economy. In the past three years, the high-tech  sector has contributed 27% of the growth in gross domestic product, compared  with 14% for residential housing and only 4% for the auto sector. Over the past  year, a stunning 33% of GDP growth has come from information -technology  industries, propelled by everything from the Internet boom to the rise of  direct-broadcast satellite television.</p>
<p>
This is the classical model  of capitalist accumulation. By investing in machinery, the capitalists in this  sector have secured huge increases in productivity, allowing them to obtain  simultaneously high profits (not for nothing is Bill Gates the richest man in  the world), raising wages (in contrast to the majority of American workers) for  programmers, net-work technicians, and other high-tech workers, and constantly  falling prices for such products as computers and communications equipment.  This cheapening of the elements of production has been&#8212;along side the systematic  holding down of wages for most workers&#8212; one of the main reasons for the  absence of inflationary pressures in the US economy during the present  cycle&#8212;at least up till now.</p>
<p>
Information technology has  in the last three years displaced cars, steel, and construction as the main  motor-force of the US economy. Nine million people now work in this  sector&#8212;more than steel or automobiles. Over the past three years in fact, the  high-tech sector experienced strong growth while the rest of the economy slowed  down. High-tech, as measured by Business Week, totalled some $420 billion in  1996. Consumers and businesses now spend $282 billion in the US on information  technology hardware alone. That&rsquo;s 17% more than US purchases of new motor  vehicles and parts, 49% more than spending on new homes, and 168% more than  commercial and industrial construction. </p>
<p>
High-tech also plays a key  role in the stock exchange. From 1993 to the end of 1996, high-tech stocks have  been the market leaders, pulling other sectors along with them. Over that  three-year stretch, high-tech stocks have produced blistering annual returns of  35%, compared with 20% for the S&amp;P 500. However, there are already signs  that this is also reaching its limits. Business Week warns: &ldquo;Riding a wave of  technological optimism, the computer, software, and communications industries  have grown at a pace far exceeding the rest of the economy over the past three  years, helping to extend the expansion.</p>
<p>
As has always happened  throughout the history of capitalism, the capitalists invest in order to earn  the maximum profits. Where a new and profitable field of investment opens up,  the first to exploit it can obtain very large profits. But inevitably, as  others pile in, the rate of profit tends to average out. Prices and profits  begin to fall. The initial investment required to build a high-tech factory or  to create a programme or a microprocessor is huge, although the cost of  actually producing the chips or software for sale is relatively low. Rising  demand drives average costs down still further, making it possible to charge  lower prices and boosting demand even further. </p>
<p>
However, there is a problem  with this so-called &ldquo;virtuous circle&rdquo;. As with any other profitable field of  investment, at a certain stage overproduction begins to appear, eventually  provoking a crisis. In the last cycle, this could be clearly seen in the field  of office construction. When the recession finally struck in 1990, the  spectacular crash of consumer spending and office construction made the downturn  much worse. High-tech now finds itself in a similar position, as Business Week  points out: &ldquo;Over the past three years, business spending on  information-technology gear has risen by almost 45%. Meanwhile, spending on  labour has risen by only 19%. Even if information technology has become a  strategic asset for many businesses, its very size makes it a logical place to  cut or postpone when times get tough.&rdquo; The fact that so many workers in this  sector are hired on a temporary basis (including outside consulting firms)  makes it easier to sack them in a downturn. This will rapidly spread to other  parts of the economy such as the telephone and networking industries.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;But this exuberance has a  price: With high tech having grown so big, the economy is now vulnerable to a  high-tech slowdown in a way that was never true before. And there are already  troubling signs of weakness in those industries that, if prolonged, could  foreshadow a wider slump&#8212;as well as a steep decline in the stock market.&rdquo; And  remember that these lines were written several months before the stock exchange  crisis. This shows that the serious representatives of capital already  understood that the present boom was reaching its limits, and that,  consequently, the stock market crisis did in fact reflect, however imperfectly,  the real state of affairs. In the same way, it shows concretely the  relationship between a crisis in the stock exchange and the real process of  production.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;But if and when things  turn sour, look out. Information technology&#8212;now the single largest line in  many corporate capital budgets&#8212;will make a tempting target for cost-cutting if  the product cycle slows, or if the rest of the economy should slip because of,  say, a Fed rate hike. Inventories are lean, and with 3.5 million jobs eliminated  since 1989, Corporate America has squeezed most of the fat out of its  workforce. Next time the economy slows, the only way tight-pressed companies  can save money will be to delay nonessential info-tech projects. &lsquo;Our industry  used to be immune from the business cycle,&rsquo; says Eric A. Benhamou, CEO and  chairman of 3Com Corp. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re no longer flying under the radar. There&rsquo;s just  too much money being spent.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The downside of the new  business cycle could have dramatic consequences for employment, investment, and  growth. In Silicon Valley, in Boston, and in other high-tech hotbeds across the  country, a multitude of software companies are staffing up in expectation of  20% annual growth, hiring hordes of programmers, testers, and technical writers  who would not be needed if high-tech sales slowed. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a speculative bubble,&rsquo;  says Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA/Anderson Business Forecasting Project,  &lsquo;and there will be a lot of very disappointed people&rsquo; when the boom slows.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;If profits drop sharply  enough, most high-tech companies would have to curtail new-product development  and the construction of factories. Venture-capital funds, now going begging,  would dry up. As the breakneck pace of technological change slowed, buyers  would have less reason to upgrade immediately to the next generation of  computers or software, dampening demand even more. &lsquo; If our rate of innovation  slowed, and the buying momentum consequently lessened, presumably that could  have repercussions on the whole economy,&rsquo; says Grove.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>
  <strong>Crisis of Overproduction</strong> </h4>
<p>
In recent weeks there has  been an increasing number of voices in economic journals expressing concern  about overproduction, or, as they prefer to put it, over-capacity. October 1,  1997 an article appeared in the New York Times signed by William Greider&#8212;the  author of &ldquo;One World, Ready or Not: The Manic Logic of Global Capitalism.&rdquo;&#8212;entitled  &ldquo;When Optimism Meets Overcapacity&rdquo; which sounded a warning note:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Early this year, an  article in The Wall Street Journal announced that the globalised economy had  entered a &ldquo;new era&rdquo; of stronger, trouble-free prosperity. In August, the  newspaper revised the outlook. Actually, The Journal reported, many industrial  sectors are burdened by dangerous levels of overcapacity, too much potential  output and not enough buyers. This glut, it said, promises ugly shakeouts  ahead&#8212;failing companies, more closed factories&#8212;if not something worse.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;For the same reason, a  cover story in The Economist summed up the global auto industry this way: &ldquo;Car  firms head for a crash.&rdquo; The industry will be able to produce nearly 80 million  vehicles by 2000 for a market of fewer than 60 million buyers. The imbalances  create downward pressure on prices and reduce return on sales. More factories  must close, more large companies will merge or fail.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The Financial Times  reported that, thanks to the deluge of investment, even a hot market like China  is now stuck with overcapacity, from cars to chemicals to electronics. A couple  of years back, every multinational rushed to build plants there and catch the  wave of China&rsquo;s rising consumption. Now factories, not consumers, are  overabundant.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Some respected Wall Street  observers are now expressing concern, as the glut of productive capacity drives  down prices and, eventually, profits. James Grant, editor of Grant&rsquo;s Interest  Rate Observer, noted a general glut in areas as diverse as semiconductor plants  and aircraft factories. &ldquo;There are too many hotels in Phoenix and there is too  much manufacturing capacity in China,&rdquo; he wrote. </p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;If a general deflation  does occur, whether sudden or gradual, it will generate a negative cycle of  falling prices and wages, depressing output and financial values, from real  estate loans to stocks and bonds.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;William H. Gross, the  respected managing director of Pacific Mutual Investment Company, which manages  more than $90 billion in bonds worldwide, now pegs the risk of a general  deflation at 1 in 5 over the next several years. &ldquo;My deflationary fears are  supported by two arguments&#8212;exceptional productivity growth and global glut,&rdquo;  Mr. Gross said. He cites twin causes: real wages, both in the United States and  abroad, cannot keep up with the rapid growth of new production&#8212;that is, there  won&rsquo;t be enough demand to buy all the excess goods. And emerging economies  create aggressive new players eager to outproduce and underprice everyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Similar concerns were  expressed in a recent editorial of Business Week:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The global economy is  awash in a sea of capacity. Name the product: autos, chips, steel, chemicals,  computers, refrigerators, clothes. Now that inflation doesn&rsquo;t terrify people,  Cassandras are raising concerns about deflation. They argue that supply is  outstripping demand, and a deflationary spiral will send the world into a 1930&rsquo;s  style depression. Some proponents of deflation even want to get the Fed to cut  rates to boost domestic demand. Let&rsquo;s take time out and consider the issue. So  far, deflationary pressures have actually been a boon to the US and, indeed,  the New Economy thrives on it. If there is a demand problem looming, it is very  much an Asia phenomenon, and therefore the solution lies in Asia.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Look at Japan, mired in  its own liquidity trap. Its benchmark government bond yield is down to 1.78%,  lower than US rates during the Depression. Yet business credit demand is dead  in the water and the economy is showing zero growth for the first half of the  year. Monetary policy is helpless and fiscal policy is misbegotten. Taxes,  already high thanks to the cost of a heavy government bureaucracy, just went  up. A deflationary spiral has sent prices for goods, land, and stocks falling.  Instead of deregulating and lowering taxes to boost domestic demand, Tokyo is  cheapening the yen to encourage Japanese companies to export and tap US demand.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;China is the wild card in  the overcapacity scenario. Beijing says that one-third of all industrial  products made in the country, from VCRs to washing machines, are in oversupply.  This is just the beginning. China is building a giant export machine while  protecting its own domestic markets and industries. In good mercantilist  fashion, China hoards its foreign-exchange reserves instead of spending it for  imports. The yuan, like the yen, is deliberately kept low to promote exports  and curb imports. Ditto for Korea. Throw in the Southeast Asian financial  crisis, and the overcapacity/demand scenario looms large.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The solution is to boost  demand in Asia by dismantling mercantilist practices. US economic growth is  already maxed out and there is no way American demand can absorb the capacity  being generated in Asia. The good news is that incomes are already soaring  around the Pacific Rim and the middle class is exploding. Truth is, demand is  already beginning to catch up to supply in Asia.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;So how worried should we  be about overcapacity? Deflation in the 1990s is uncharted territory. In the &lsquo;30s,  it destroyed income and jobs, eviscerated savings, and kept the world poor from  1929 until World War II. Yet in this decade, deflation has led to higher growth  and rising real wages as high-tech companies cut costs, raise productivity, and  increase unit sales to compensate for falling prices. The big question is  whether this can work for the entire global economy. Will there come a point  when increases in productivity and unit sales fail to outpace falling prices,  triggering a deflationary spiral? With US producer prices down 0.4% for the  year and inflation approaching zero, we may soon get an answer.&rdquo; (Business  Week, 13/10/97 )</p>
<p>
These fears are not  exaggerated. The existence of overproduction is well documented. There is  over-capacity world-wide in a whole series of basic sectors, not just cars and  steel, but also microchips. According to the Economist article quoted by  Greider, even if the entire US automobile industry were to disappear, there  would still be too many cars on the market. In volume three of Capital Marx  points out that overproduction manifests itself at the close of the economic  cycle. The market, he explains, expands more slowly than production. The narrow  base of consumption of the masses in Asia cannot contain the colossal increase  in commodity production, both at home and in terms of imported goods from the  USA, Japan and Europe, all struggling to conquer this market. The case of cars  alone illustrates the point. Not only are Toyota, Ford and Volkswagen fighting  for access to the Asian market, but the Asian countries themselves are  beginning to produce cars&#8212;China, Indonesia, Malaysia all intend to produce  their &ldquo;own&rdquo; cars which will add to the glut not just on Asian markets but on the  world market. Sooner or later, what has taken place in Asia will be reproduced  on a global scale, creating the conditions for a fully-fledged slump.</p>
<h4>
  <strong>The crisis in Asia</strong> </h4>
<p>
One of the factors that has  played an important role in the recent development of the world economy has  been the entry of new areas which had previously played a fairly marginal role  but which now acquire an increasing importance in the calculations of world  capitalism. This is particularly the case with the so-called Asian &ldquo;tigers&rdquo;&#8212;Taiwan,  South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and more recently Indonesia, Thailand and  Malaysia. But the greatest hopes were aroused by the prospect of the opening-up  of China with its huge population of 1,2 billion people. Actually, there is  nothing new in this. In every period of capitalist development from the 16th  century onwards, new areas, whole continents even, have been drawn into the  system of capitalist production&#8212;first the New World in the dawn of capitalism,  then the colonies in Asia and Africa in the 18th century , then China,  Australia, California and South Africa during the 19th century, and so on.</p>
<p>
The emergence of the  so-called &ldquo;tiger economies&rdquo; did not prevent the recession of 1990-92, but it  did prevent it from turning into a deep slump or depression. However, the Asian  market, important though it is, is not sufficient to absorb all the exports of  Japan, Europe and the USA. There is a fierce struggle for markets in Asia  between all these countries. this is an expression of the limited nature of their  home markets, and the lack of demand reflecting the low purchasing power of the  masses. Ten years ago the USA only exported the equivalent of 6% of its GDP.  This has now increased to 13%&#8212;quite an astonishing achievement in such a short  time&#8212;and it wants to increase this figure to 20% by the year 2000. This means  increased tensions and conflicts with Japan and Europe which can place the  entire system of world trade at risk, especially in the event of a deep slump.  The struggle for the Asian market is only one expression of this conflict which  continually manifests itself in all manner of ways.</p>
<p>
In actual fact, the role  that the &ldquo;tigers&rdquo; could play in the world economy (at least at the present  time) has been greatly exaggerated. Most of them are quite small&#8212;two of them  (Singapore and Hong Kong) are, in effect, city-states. Taiwan and South Korea  are special cases where US imperialism was compelled to help them to develop  because of fear of the Chinese revolution (the same was true of Japan after  1945). However, these economies do not have anything approaching the economic  weight of Japan, which remains in a depressed state seven years after the last  crisis and shows no signs of a serious recovery. </p>
<p>
The only economy that could  make a fundamental difference to the world economy under certain conditions  would be China. However, here too the Western capitalists miscalculated. It is  true that huge sums have been invested in China over the last decade. To some  extent, China has fulfilled the role that the West had originally intended for  Russia. It is a paradox that where they have failed to invest in Russia&#8212;which  obediently followed all the advise of the IMF (crazy advise even from the  standpoint of the Russian nascent bourgeoisie)&#8212;they have invested large amounts  in China where the Stalinist bureaucracy keeps a firm grip on power and pursues  an independent agenda. However, from a capitalist point of view, China does not  represent a market of 1.2 billion people at all, since a market represents  purchasing power. Despite advances in certain areas, China remains a relatively  backward economy in which the great majority (800 million) still live in the  countryside in conditions of poverty. Even the rapid growth in the coastal  areas generates new contradictions. China has become a significant exporter of  cheap goods which have begun to invade western markets. At the present rate of  expansion, China will soon replace Japan as the country with the biggest trade  surplus with the United States, a situation which has set alarm bells ringing  in Washington.</p>
<p>
Over-capacity played a  major part in the crisis in Asia. As far back as December 1996, in a leader  article entitled &ldquo;Asia: What&rsquo;s Behind the Slump&rdquo;, Business Week reported that:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;As they race to develop  their industrial clout, these nations are creating other problems. Overcapacity  looms in such key areas as petrochemicals, consumer appliances, passenger cars,  and chips. The region has based its strategy on the experience of Japan, South  Korea, and Taiwan, which graduated to higher value-added industries through  skilful use of protection and subsidy after losing competitiveness in garments,  shoes and toys. East Asia doesn&rsquo;t need all these refineries and car plants. But  policymakers seem oblivious to what their neighbours have been building so  furiously.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;In petrochemicals,  Indonesia, Thailand, China, Taiwan, and South Korea all are sinking billions  into sprawling complexes. This year, a chemicals glut pushed prices down by  36%, walloping Asian producers. Yet the building binge rages on. South Korea,  already accused by its neighbours of dumping, has three huge petrochemical  plants under development and three more on the drawing board. They include  plants by giants Hyundai Corp. and Samsung Group. &lsquo;Once Samsung and Hyunday get  into petrochemicals, they will overbuild like they do in autos,&rsquo; says McKinsey  &amp; Co. chemical consultant Steve Tagtmeier: &lsquo;They&rsquo;re going to crash the  world market.&rsquo; Kim Tae Han, strategic planning manager for Samsung&rsquo;s chemical  group, is unfazed: &lsquo;To compete with European and US companies, we need to  expand.&rsquo;&ldquo; (Business Week, 2/12/96.)</p>
<p>
And Greider points out  that:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;The visible disorder that  gets official attention involves finance&#8212;dramatic currency devaluations,  overexposed banks, the sudden flight of foreign investors. But the underlying  cause, as some acknowledge, is overcapacity. Thailand is a classic illustration  of how financial markets can get ahead of reality and destabilise the real  economy of producers and consumers. Bankers and investors are so busy lending  and investing and bidding up prices that they don&rsquo;t see that the new factories  they&rsquo;re financing may not be able to sell their output.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
The increased exports from  Asia is the other side of the coin of the coin of the drawing in of new  elements into the all-encompassing world market. Moreover, western exports to  Asia will be affected by the slowdown. South Korea has entered into a serious  crisis. Now it has been followed by crises in Thailand, Indonesia and Hong  Kong. This shows that the boom in Asia reaching its limits. The stock market  and currency crises which began this summer and have continued with ups and  downs ever since are merely a reflection of this fact. </p>
<p>
By plunging Asia into  crisis and compelling one country after another to devalue, international  finance capital has unwittingly acted as an agent of revolution. As was the  case one hundred years ago in Russia, imperialism has strengthened the working  class in Asia by exporting capital in their greed for profits. In an article  entitled &ldquo;Asian currency crisis: rescuing the rich&rdquo;, Eva Cheng spells out the  consequences of the crisis for Asia:</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Inflation will escalate  and a big drop in the standard of living for the common people in these  countries is guaranteed. In Thailand, this process will be spurred by the  International Monetary Fund-brokered &ldquo;bail-out&rdquo; credit line of US$17 billion.  As usual, this requires deep cuts in social spending, reserving the biggest  burdens for the poor.&rdquo; The dream of millions of people of a prosperous future  through hard work and saving will be shattered, leaving the road of struggle as  the only viable option open to them. This will mean further social and  political upheavals in one country after another, creating the conditions for a  revolutionary mass movement as was already anticipated by the magnificent  movement of the workers of South Korea. In Indonesia in particular there is an  enormous revolutionary potential because of the crisis of the Suharto  dictatorship and the beginnings of a reawakening of the proletariat. </p>
<p>
Above all, the fate of Asia  will be decided by events in China. Although it has not been given much  publicity, the economic turmoil has spread to China, where there has been a  wave of strikes over the past year. Once the mighty Chinese working class moves  into action, the whole situation can be rapidly transformed. The fears of the  bourgeois were expressed in the pages of the Guardian. A bear raider Simon  Cawkwell reported a conversation with a partner in the Far East: &ldquo;Instead, he  said, I should concentrate upon the massive economic disarray that has  developed in China&#8212;a much larger and more significant territory altogether.  He emphasised that the pattern of lending and borrowing in China is out of  control.&rdquo; (31/10/97)</p>
<h4>
  <strong>Pessimism of the  Bourgeois</strong> </h4>
<p>
The recent events have  undoubtedly worried the more thinking representatives of the bourgeois. &ldquo;People  are worried a global financial crisis is probably around the corner,&rdquo; said  Bentham Hung, manager of the $37 million All Weather Fund for President Investment  Trust Corp. in Taiwan. There can be no doubt that the collapse caused panic in  financial circles. &ldquo;The beginnings of the first sustained bear market for 17  years&rdquo;, one financial market strategist described it. (quoted in The Guardian,  28/10/97.) The mood on Wall Street was summed up as follows: &ldquo;As dealers in New  York begged for trading to be stopped, President Bill Clinton was briefed on  the unfolding crisis. Attempting to restore calm to America&rsquo;s feverish  financial markets, a White House spokesman said: &lsquo;The President is confident  the fundamentals of the American economy are strong.&rsquo; Others were less  sanguine. One analyst said: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s just feeding on itself. People are selling to  take profits while there are profits to take.&rsquo; &ldquo; (The Independent, 28/10/97.)</p>
<p>
This is by no means the  majority view of the bourgeois. A more common view was expressed by one of the  strategists of Capital:</p>
<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re into a severe  correction,&rdquo; said William Dodge, principal at money-management firm Marvin  &amp; Palmer in Wilmington, Del. &ldquo;But this is not the start of a bear market,&rdquo;  he argued. By Dodge&rsquo;s definition, a true bear market is a decline of more than  20% in stock indexes like the Dow and the Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500. Despite  the panic selling worldwide in recent days triggered by worries over Southeast  Asia&rsquo;s economic and market woes, Dodge and many other big investors believe  there is little fundamentally wrong with the US economy and stock market&#8212;other  than that share prices had gotten ahead of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
As always, there is no  shortage of soothing voices, assuring investors that the future is rosy and, of  course, &ldquo;the fundamentals are sound&rdquo;. Those fundamentals include low interest  rates, continuing corporate earnings growth, a highly competitive US economy,  and low inflation. However, the fear of a slump is ever-present, like the ghost  of Banquo in Shakespeare&rsquo;s Macbeth. All attempts to exorcise it are in vain!  Writing in the Los Angeles Times, Tom Petrunio, the Times Staff Writer spells  out a very different scenario:</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Perhaps most troubling,  some experts suggest, is the possibility that the market&rsquo;s plunge foretells  economic trouble that won&rsquo;t be evident for many months. That worry centres on  fears that Asia&rsquo;s turmoil will trigger a global economic slowdown&#8212;and price  deflation&#8212;so severe that it will cripple US companies&rsquo; still-robust earnings,  effectively pulling the rug out from under stock prices even if interest rates  continue to decline. That possibility has been dubbed the &ldquo;ice&rdquo; scenario for  the world economy. And even money managers like Dodge, who don&rsquo;t expect that  something so dire will occur, admit that it will become a much bigger topic of  discussion as markets globally plummet and questions are raised about consumer  and business confidence.</p>

&ldquo;In this environment, people  who want to talk about &ldquo;ice&rsquo; now have something to talk about,&rdquo; he said. Even  though the American economy&rsquo;s health mostly depends on domestic consumption  rather than exports, the great fear is that American consumers&#8212;twice as many  of which are investors in the stock market today as in 1987 (surveys suggest  more than 4 in 10 Americans now invest)&#8212;will suddenly begin to clamp down on  their spending because they feel poorer as their retirement savings plans and  other stock accounts fall in value. The same point was made by veteran  Keynesian economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who argued that when people feel  poorer, they spend less. Thus, despite all the brave talk and the rally on the  stock market, the effects of the recent crisis can still make themselves felt  in the coming months. The big investors will have made a good killing. But many  small investors must have lost heavily. And this is by no means the last fall.  The confidence of the big companies in future investments will also have been  shaken, as even Alan Greenspan was forced to admit: &ldquo;Commenting on market  developments, Mr Greenspan said that even after the sharp rebound around the  world in the past 24 hours, declines in global markets have left investors less  wealthy and business facing a higher cost of capital&rdquo;. (The Guardian, 30/10/97) </p>

The effects on investors  was also spelled out in the Los Angeles Times (29/10/97):</p>

&ldquo;Q: What happens when  investors sell off stocks in companies with ties to Asia?</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;A: Most Fortune 500  manufacturing companies have plants in Asia. Their revenues could suffer twice,  once because of US stock price losses and again because the dollar, stronger in  Asia, will translate into losses on the balance sheet. That&rsquo;s because any  assets the companies own in that region denominated in those currencies will be  worth less and companies then will be loath to expand.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Q: How does that affect  Main Street?</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;A: Very simply, if Fortune  500s or other companies see their revenues and profits diminish, they either  won&rsquo;t be hiring or they may well be laying off workers.&rdquo;</p>

But by far the most damning  indictment came from billionaire investor George Soros. This is not the first  time that Soros has expressed doubts in the future of capitalism. His opinions  deserve attention if for no other reason than his very close acquaintance with  the workings of the market economy. Unlike those bourgeois economists who  pontificate from their university pulpits, and whose views are of not the  slightest interest to anyone, Soros has at least made several fortunes through  his practical activity as a big time speculator. The Guardian (30/10/97)  published an article entitled &ldquo;Soros warns of society in ruins&rdquo;. It begins as  follows: &ldquo;George Soros, the archetypal capitalist, believes that financial  markets are so unstable that they can &lsquo;destroy society&rsquo;.&rdquo; He is quoted as  saying: &ldquo;</p>
<p>
If fluctuations become too  large &ldquo;you can have a breakdown. It will come through political and eventually  military events, rather than events merely in the financial markets&rdquo;. he adds: &ldquo;Markets  can move in unexpected ways and become chaotic. I&rsquo;m afraid that the prevailing  view, which is one of extending the market mechanism to all domains, has the  potential of destroying society.</p>
<p class="quote">
&ldquo;Unless we review our  concept of markets, our understanding of markets, they will collapse, because  we are creating global markets, global financial markets without understanding  their true nature. We have this false theory that markets left to their own  devices tend towards equilibrium&rdquo;. (The Guardian, 30/10/97)</p>
<p>
Of course, there is much  that is mistaken in Soros&rsquo; analysis. He is not a Marxist! He approaches the  question of the economy purely from the point of view of finance capital. But,  given his profession, that is hardly surprising. Also, in the absence of a  socialist perspective, he concludes that the breakdown of capitalism can only  result in &ldquo;military events&rdquo;&#8212;which might mean either a war or a military  dictatorship of some sort. We need not go into these questions here, except to  say that George Soros does not see that the crisis of capitalism can only be  resolved when the working class puts an end to the dictatorship of the banks  and monopolies and introduces a planned economy on the basis of a genuine  workers&rsquo; democracy. Of course, we never expected Mr. Soros to understand or  accept this. It is enough that this &ldquo;archetypal capitalist&rdquo; has, from his own  very considerable experience, come to a correct conclusion: that the capitalist  system is undermining itself through its own inherent and insoluble  contradictions. That Mr. Soros is who he is makes such an admission a thousand  times more valuable.</p>
<h4>
  <strong>Consequences of a slump</strong> </h4>
<p>
For Marxists, the  importance of economic perspectives consists in the social and political  consequences that derive from them. It is necessary to introduce a number of  caveats here. Firstly, economics&#8212;even Marxist economics&#8212;is not an exact  science. Long ago, Engels pointed out that it was impossible to make an exact  economic prediction because, apart from anything else, the necessary  statistical information always arrives after the event. Even today, with the  colossal power of modern computers, the situation has not changed  fundamentally. Not long ago a man who had made a lot of money gambling on the  stock exchange was criticised for basing himself on mere &ldquo;anecdotal evidence.&rdquo;  His reply was quite interesting. He said &ldquo;Of course I base myself on anecdotal  evidence. What else can I base myself on? Statistics? That is a bit like  looking in the rear window of my car.&rdquo; In other words, statistics only show us  what has already passed. They do not tell us what is going to happen. It is  very dangerous to assume that present trends will continue in the future. That  is precisely the mistake of those (and they are many) who assume, for no good  reason, that the US economy will continue to grow and that prices of shares  will continue to rise. Of such stuff are stock exchange crashes made!</p>
<p>
While it is not possible to  make precise economic predictions, it is both possible and necessary to study  the fundamentals and try to assess the basic processes to see where we are  heading. The first thing that is necessary is to discount the huge amount of  triumphalist propaganda that has no base in reality but is meant to provide  some kind of justification for the capitalist system and soothe the nerves of  investors. The assertions that the business cycle has been abolished and that  capitalism has entered a new phase of uninterrupted growth (&ldquo;the New Paradigm&rdquo;)  is devoid of any scientific, theoretical or empirical basis. We are heading for  a new slump worldwide. The only questions are when? and how deep?</p>
<p>
To the first question it is  impossible to give a definite answer, except that to say that, after seven  years of expansion in the USA, it is probable that the present boom will not continue  for more than one or two years, and possibly will end far sooner. As to the  second, we have already expressed an opinion, based on a number of empirically  verifiable considerations. To look no further: the present boom is wholly  different to the kind of boom we saw in the period of capitalist upswing from  1948-74. At the peak of the boom there are, according to official figures that  grossly understate the real position, over 30 million unemployed in the  advanced capitalist economies of the OECD. In Germany, for the first time since  Hitler, there are 4.5 million out of work (11.5%). In France, 12.4%; in Italy,  12.4%; in Belgium, 14.1%; in Spain, an astonishing 20.8%. The unemployment  figures for Japan and the USA cannot be accepted at face value because  different methods of calculation are used. A large number of people in &ldquo;employment&rdquo;  only work a few hours a week on low pay. Everywhere there has been a  proliferation of part-time jobs, &ldquo;MacJobs&rdquo;, &ldquo;rubbish contracts&rdquo; as they are  called in France. Of the nine million or so people who depend on the  information technology sector in the States, a large number are on temporary  contracts and can be dismissed immediately when there is a downturn in the  market. If this is the situation at the &ldquo;peak&rdquo; of the boom, what will happen in  the next slump?</p>
<p>
It cannot be excluded that  a new crisis on the stock exchange may be contained, thus providing a &ldquo;correction&rdquo;  which will not lead directly to a slump, but prepare a further period of  expansion. All taken into account, this does not seem the most likely scenario.  But even in that case, the boom could only continue for one or two years at  most, and then end up in an even steeper collapse. However, the latest reports  indicate that the turbulence on the stock markets has by no means exhausted  itself. Not only are Latin America and Asia still in crisis, but there is a  sustained assault against the Greek drachma, which indicates that the money  markets are still seeking out the weaker currencies, like a hunter who is  seized with blood-lust. Most important is the self-evident fact that, even  after the recent losses, stock market values in the USA and Europe are still  seriously over-valued. New panics and falls are therefore inevitable in the  next few months, weeks, or even days. Already these is a new wave of panic. &ldquo;A  new bout of panic selling of stocks last night spread like flu to both North  and Latin America as fears of depressed corporate earnings and economic  downturn in Asia gripped the world&rsquo;s financial markets&rdquo;, reported the Guardian  (31/10/97). &ldquo;It looks as though its&rsquo; round two, to use a boxing analogy,&rdquo; said  Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London.</p>
<p>
The present propaganda to  the effect that &ldquo;all is well&rdquo; is designed to reassure the army of small  investors, some of whom have foolishly decided to return to the market with  that self-confident air that is usually associated with sheep on their way to  the slaughter-house. Of course, those that lead them there will, as usual,  escape without so much as a scratch! The exact timing of events is impossible  to determine. But that it will all end in tears is not open to serious debate.</p>
<p>
If, as seems most likely,  the next slump will be severe, what effect will that have on the class  struggle? Marxism has never established a direct corollary between slumps and  the class struggle. Trotsky once pointed out that poverty, in and of itself,  did not give rise to revolution. If that was the case, the masses would always  be in revolt! But it is not the case. As a matter of fact, the initial effect  of a deep slump would be temporarily to stun and disorient the working class.  The onset of mass unemployment (far greater than the present figures, which are  already very high) would act as a brake on the economic struggle, although  important defensive struggles would occur, strikes against wage cuts and even  factory occupations to prevent closures. However, a big movement on the  industrial front would be excluded for a time. It would require a new economic  recovery before that would occur. However, important political conclusions  would flow from a slump. There would be the beginning of a questioning of the  system and a generally critical mood. At a certain moment this would find an  expression within the ranks of the workers&rsquo; organisations.</p>
<p>
We can draw a rough  parallel with what happened in the USA after the 1929 crash. There was not an  immediate movement of the class. But with the beginnings of a recovery in  1933-4, there was a sharp upturn in the class struggle with strikes and  sit-ins, including the Teamsters&rsquo; rebellion in Minneapolis where the  Trotskyists played an important role. The shift to the left was dramatically  expressed by the setting up of the CIO, representing millions of previously  unorganised workers who quickly moved in a radical direction. On a world scale,  the crisis of capitalism expressed itself in revolutionary and  pre-revolutionary situations in one country after another, and, as a corollary,  movements towards reaction in either a Bonapartist or fascist form. For reasons  we have explained, it is ruled out that the fascists could come to power now as  they did in the 1930s. But the general scenario will have many similarities  with that turbulent period. Certainly, the coming period will be very different  to that of 1948-74.</p>
<p>
The post-War period has not  seen a deep slump as in the 1930s. This would shake the masses out of the  habits and routine of the past. It is not an accident that in the 1930s, the  social crisis found its expression in a whole series of internal crises and splits  in the mass organisations of the working class. Particularly important was the  crystallisation of mass left wing currents in the Social democratic parties.  This has not generally been the case in the post-war period in Europe, although  there were tendencies in this direction in the 1970s, in the period of the  first serious recession in world capitalism since 1945. That tendency was  temporarily cut across by the boom of 1982-90. Indeed, it was reversed over  the last decade when the Labour and trade union leaders, released from the  pressure of the working class, veered sharply to the right. This fact has led  all the sectarian grouplets to write off the mass organisations as &ldquo;hopelessly  right wing&rdquo;, &ldquo;bourgeoisified&rdquo; and the rest. These people understand nothing of  the way in which the working class moves.</p>
<p>The mass organisations will  be shaken from top to bottom in the next period. Right wing leaders like Blair  who preach the amelioration of class conflict will be left high and dry by the  stormy events that impend. They have no alternative to the crisis of capitalism  except to echo the ideas and policies of the banks and monopolies. Once the  masses see what this means in practice, there will be an enormous reaction  against. Even now, the workers are gradually beginning to understand that the  capitalist system means nothing but unending exploitation, unbearable pressure,  an agony of toil, stress and worry. They will be made forcibly aware of the  contradictions of the system and begin to draw the necessary conclusions. The  ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky will begin to obtain a wider audience  as workers and young people seek an alternative and a way out of the crisis.</p>
<p>
There will be a process of  internal differentiation in the ranks of the unions, the Socialist and  Communist Parties. At a certain stage the right wing will be vomited out,  opening the way for the transformation of the mass organisations. It is  necessary to prepare for this! It is necessary to redouble our efforts to win,  educate and train cadres, above all from the younger generation who are open to  revolutionary ideas and are not hidebound by routinism, cynicism and  scepticism. For every one that can be won to Marxism now, there will be ten,  twenty or a hundred in the period that opens up before us. The working class  will learn in struggle. But the old leaders who have abandoned socialism and  capitulated to the pressures of capitalism are incorrigible. They represent the  past, not the future. The Socialist and Communist workers, starting with the  active layers, will want to return to the real traditions of the movement&#8212;to  the early days of the Socialist Parties, when they emblazoned on their banner  the socialist transformation of society, or the genuine Communism of the first  four congresses of the Communist International. On that basis, and on that  basis alone, the working class can carry out the socialist transformation of  society.</p>
