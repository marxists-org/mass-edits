<p>The recent threat of the  main G7 imperialist powers to intervene in Zaire &ldquo;in order to protect refugees&rdquo;  highlights the growing crisis in central Africa.</p>
<p>
It was pure hypocrisy. The &ldquo;protection  of refugees&rdquo; was simply a cover to hide the real intentions: to maintain  imperialism&rsquo;s grip on the rich natural resources of the region. However,  Western military intervention has been dealt a serious blow by the successes of  the Zairean opposition forces in defeating the Rwandan Hutu militias and  allowing the mass return of refugees to Rwanda. The pretext for sending  imperialist troops to the region has been removed&#8212;temporarily.</p>
<p>
The bulk of the problems  facing the peoples of Central Africa, particularly in Zaire, Rwanda and  Burundi, originated through the policy of the former colonial power, Belgium  imperialism, which deliberately played off the Tutsis against the Hutus, and  granted the Tutsi minority the top administrative posts. Previously, various  nationalities lived together and intermarried. It was a classic case of divide  and rule, leading to the present devastating conflict. However, Belgian support  for the powerful Tutsi minority waned in the 1950s when the Rwandan National  Union pressed for independence. The Belgian government set up the Party of the  Movement for the Emancipation of the Bahutu, sparking communal strife. In 1959  there was a war in which the Hutus drove out the Tutsis, and Rwanda declared a  Hutu republic in 1962. A parallel situation developed in Burundi where the Hutus  were suppressed. The Tutsis in Burundi attacked Rwanda in 1963. This resulted  in 250,000 refugees, mostly Tutsi, living in Uganda, Zaire and Burundi.</p>
<p>
A major part of the refugee  problem in eastern Zaire came about when France intervened in Rwanda in 1990  and 1993 to prop up the Hutu government of Juvenal Habyarimana, and finally in  1994 to create so-called &ldquo;safe havens&rdquo;. Then, the mainly-Tutsi opposition  Rwandan Patriotic Front invaded Rwanda and routed government troops and its  allied Interahamwe militias, which had engaged in genocide and the murder of  more than 500,000 Tutsis.</p>
<p>
The success of the  opposition forces forced the Interahamwe to flee. This, in turn, resulted in  the domination of the army and the militias over the one million refugees, who  were forced to flee to Zaire. The Interahamwe dominated the camps and even the  food rationing supplied by the international aid agencies. They launched  attacks into Rwanda and prevented the return of refugees on pain of death. The  Interahamwe&rsquo;s subsequent defeat by the Patriotic Front, freed the refugees to  return to Rwanda.</p>
<p>
In the 1950s the Belgian  imperialists, through the United Nations, moved against independence leader  Patrice Lumumba, who was betrayed and murdered by troops under the command of  Mobutu&#8212;trained and educated by the Belgian regime. Mobutu came to power,  backed by imperialism. His authoritarian regime bled the people dry, and Mobutu  turned himself into a billionaire.</p>
<p>
Now the chickens are coming  home to roost. The opposition Patriotic Front wants to establish a more  democratic regime in Zaire and has seized control of the eastern part of the  country, with the support of the Tutsis, who have lived there for 200 years.  The Mobutu regime had been trying to discriminate against them as &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo;. </p>
<p>
What motivates the  imperialists, especially French imperialism, is the fear that the Mobutu  regime, which is on its last legs, may collapse and open the road to possible  revolutionary developments in Zaire, or even precipitate the break up of the  country. This is not new. Apart from its intervention in Zaire in the 1960s,  using its Moroccan surrogates, France intervened to safeguard Mobutu in 1977  and 1978. They did the same thing in Rwanda to protect the government during  the first half of the 1990s.</p>
<p>
The Patriotic Front has out  manoeuvred the imperialists by attacking the refugee camps and forcing the  Interahamwe to flee to the bush, so opening the way for the hundreds of  thousands of refugees to return. However, this has not totally defused plans by  the imperialists to intervene. France and Canada are still pushing hard for a  full scale intervention. &ldquo;Now is not the time to pause and reflect. We still  have to have very direct action,&rdquo; stated Canadian Foreign minister Lloyd  Axworthy. The United States and Britain, however, are having cold feet.  Overseas minister Baroness Chalker, described the French plan as &ldquo;daft&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
Any foreign intervention  would now meet with hostility and even military opposition. This was made clear  by both Rwanda and Laurent Kabila, leader of the Alliance of Democratic Forces  for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire. The Canadian advance force had difficulty  getting out of Rwanda&rsquo;s capital, Kigali due to the opposition of the  government.</p>
<p>
The dis-United Nations has  played the same baneful role as always. It represents the interests of the  imperialists in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The strategic, economic and  political considerations are prime. The very last considerations would be the  needs and interests of the peoples involved. Britain and the US have pulled  back from military intervention, putting pressure on France to do the same.  However, it is not excluded that they may intervene again if civil war breaks  out in Zaire&#8212;in order to protect the economic interests of world imperialism,  particularly the enormous natural resources of this huge area. They will want  to prop up the same interests as Mobutu represented.</p>
<p>The United States and the  other imperialists have been converted to &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; in the ex-colonial areas  of the world because they find such regimes much more reliable that the  dictators that they supported previously. That is why they wanted to abandon  Mobutu if they could, and why they came out for elections in Zaire (which were  rigged in any case). They made a ghastly mess in Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi and  elsewhere in Africa. This is not due to the innate qualities of the Blacks  (which was the imperialist&rsquo;s old argument), but the class interests involved.  The imperialists interest in the so-called Third World is to bleed these countries  economically through adverse terms of trade, where these countries&rsquo; commodities  are sold below their value, while those from the West are sold at high rates.  Thus impoverishing these countries and peoples.</p>
<p>
Even if &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; is  established, it will suffer the same fate as all those &ldquo;democracies&rdquo; in Africa&#8212;all of which were run in effect by one-party states. There is no solution on  a capitalist basis. In the long term, on the establishment of a Socialist  Federation of Africa, linked to a federation of European socialist states could  offer a real way forward. In the immediate period, the Labour movement should  argue for the right of self-determination and allow the peoples to decide their  own future without outside military intervention from imperialism. This is a  principle. Despite all the hypocrisy about humanitarian intervention, what  decides the policies of the imperialist powers is the interests of capital.  That means that the Labour movement in the West must have a clear idea that the  enemy of these countries is the same enemy they face at home&#8212;capitalism and  imperialism. Only with that understanding can the movement see through the  hypocrisy of imperialism and lay the basis for the real emancipation of the  peoples of the third world.</p>
