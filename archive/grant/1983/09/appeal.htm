<p class="fst">Comrade chair, comrades, this is a sorry day
for the Labour Party, that we should be discussing expulsions
instead of discussing - as we have been doing and will continue
to do in conference - the fundamental way in which we can get rid
of the Tories. <em>(Applause)</em></p>


<p>Our crime is allegedly that we are organised. <em>Solidarity</em><sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup> is
organised. This movement has now reached a situation where MPs no
longer have a divine right to their seats. They are now
accountable to re-selection. <em>(Applause) </em>No longer do they
have the divine right to elect the leader; the leader is now
elected by the whole of the party conference, and that is
absolutely correct. But apparently one divine right remains, that
is the right of the right wing to be organised. But there is no
such right for those who can effectively fight against the right
wing.</p>


<p>If we look at our history, we see that it was
the traitors of the SDP<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup> - Rodgers, Owen, Williams - who first raised the
question of a witch-hunt in the Labour Party. In fact one of the
reasons they gave for leaving the Labour Party was that <em>Militant

</em>was not expelled from the party. There was an enormous
campaign from our enemies, in the press, in the media, by the
Tories, Thatcher, Tebbit, Howe and all the rest, demanding that <em>Militant
</em>should be expelled so that Labour could set its house in
order.</p>


<p>Were they grateful when the expulsions took
place? On the contrary, they used this to show the disunity in
the Labour Party. Is it not an absolute disgrace that four or
five NEC meetings before the general election were taken up with
discussions about <em>Militant</em>, instead of with preparing a
campaign that would be victorious against the Tories? <em>(Applause)</em></p>


<p>We have it on the word of Jim Mortimer<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-3" name="doc-3">(3)</a></sup>
himself last November that a large majority of constituency
Labour parties were not sympathetic to the exclusion of <em>Militant</em>.
To those I would add the overwhelming majority of the rank
and file of the trade unions. They want unity; they do not want
to spend years discussing this question.</p>


<p>If we take the situation that exists, nobody
can deny that among the best workers in the general election,
among the best workers in the local elections, among the best
workers at all times in the Labour Party are the supporters of <em>Militant.
(Applause and interruptions)</em></p>


<p>We warned the NEC before the Bermondsey
by-election that it would be absolute madness to expel us just on
the eve of a by-election. We asked that the hearing should be
postponed for a week, a month or as long as they liked. The right
wing said that if these expulsions took place that would help to
gain a victory. We saw the result in Bermondsey. We have seen the
result in the general election, the result of witch-hunting.</p>


<p>My final point, comrade chair and comrades.
Michael Foot was expelled from this party. Nye Bevan was expelled
from this party. <em>(Interruptions) </em>Mortimer was expelled
from the party. <em>(Calls of 'no, no') </em>Yes, it's absolutely
true, these were all expelled from the party.</p>


<p>Whatever the result of this vote, whether we
gain a victory or whether we are expelled, we shall still
continue to work for a Labour victory.</p>


<p>We shall still continue to work to make certain
that this Tory government is thrown out, and preferably a Labour
government with socialist policies returned. Whatever programme
is put forward, <em>Militant</em>, as it has always done in the
past, will continue to work for the victory of this movement.
There is no way that Marxism can be separated from the Labour
Party. There is no way you will succeed with these expulsions. We
will be back. We will be restored, if not in one year, in two or
three years. We will be back.</p>


<p>At every trade union conference, at every ward,
at every GMC, at every shop stewards' committee meeting this
question will come up and we will be back. <em>(Applause)</em></p>


<p><b>The appeal was lost on a card vote:
4,972,000 to 1,790,000.</b></p>
