<p class="fst">It is now the fiftieth anniversary of the assassination of Leon
Trotsky by an agent of Stalin and more than one hundred and ten
years since his birth on October 26, 1879. This has been an epoch
of changes and upheavals greater than any other period of recorded
history, perhaps the most disturbed century in the history of
mankind.</p>

<p>Two world wars, the Russian revolution, the rise of Stalinism,
the victory of the Soviet Union in the second world war, the
Chinese revolution, the retreat from open military domination by
imperialism to economic neo-colonial domination in the third world
- these were the great events of this century which marked decisive
stages in the history of the world.</p>

<p>Now a third turning point - the crisis of Stalinism in Russia
and Eastern Europe - opens up a new stage in history. The
representatives of the imperialist powers have been rubbing their
hands with delight. Without firing a shot they have returned - they
think - Eastern Europe back into their orbit and rolled back the
menace of &lsquo;communism&rsquo;, in reality Stalinism. Yet history has still
to say its last word. What we have seen in Eastern Europe will he
as nothing to the crisis - political, economic and social - that
will develop in the West. And as the crisis develops, left forces
will again come to the fore. &lsquo;Trotskyism&rsquo;, the policy of social
revolution will come into its own.</p>

<p>In his autobiography, <em>My Life</em>, Trotsky relates how
eight years before the revolution of 1905, a young group of
revolutionaries with a hectograph (a hand duplicator), produced a
leaflet attacking tsarism. This was the beginning of the
revolutionary activity of Leon Trotsky. The forces of the
revolution were much weaker then than they are at the present day.
Yet eight years later there was the 1905 revolution and twenty
years later in 1917 the empire of the tsars, which had endured for
a thousand years, was overthrown.</p>

<p>The Russian Social-Democrats were organised in a centralised
party. There was a split in 1903 which, while accidental -
occurring over a secondary question, was indicative of the
different paths the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks would take in future
years. It showed the difference, as Trotsky was to explain later,
between &rsquo;hards&rsquo; and &rsquo;softs&rsquo;. Trotsky himself remained with the
Mensheviks for about a year and then broke away from them, standing
midway between the position of the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
Nevertheless, as Lenin&rsquo;s widow Krupskaya was to write to Trotsky a
few days after Lenin&rsquo;s death, Lenin maintained the same attitude
towards Trotsky throughout his life. He understood the role which
Trotsky could play.</p>

<p>The 1903 split was not a simple question, as the Stalinists were
later to try and pretend, of an immediate parting between the two
factions of the Social-Democracy. There was the Unity Congress -
the Stockholm Congress of 1906 - where for a temporary period,
Bolsheviks and Mensheviks came together again. Lenin only finally
came to the conclusion that there could no longer be unity for
revolutionary purposes in 1912. Only then did the Bolsheviks come
out as an independent party.</p>

<p>After 1904 Trotsky had stood outside both factions. But in 1917
he marched arm in arm with the Bolsheviks. In March 1917, when
Trotsky was in New York and Lenin in Switzerland, they
independently adopted exactly the same approach to the provisional
government. After the February revolution, the Bolshevik leaders
inside Russia, including Stalin and Kamenev, advocated union with
the Mensheviks. Trotsky was inflexibly opposed, as of course was
Lenin. Yet at that time, as Trotsky explained, &ldquo;the movement that
had found its symbol in Kerensky seemed all-powerful... Bolshevism
seemed nothing more than an &rsquo;insignificant group&rsquo;... The party
itself did not realise the power it was to have on the day after,
but Lenin was leading it firmly toward its greatest tasks. I
harnessed myself to the work and helped him.&rdquo; <em>My Life</em>,
p332.</p>

<p>On September 7, 1917 Trotsky wrote in <em>Pravda</em>: &ldquo;To us
internationalism is not an abstract idea existing only to be
betrayed on every opportune occasion, as it is to Tzereteli and
Chernov, (Menshevik and SR leaders - EG) but is a real guiding and
wholly practical principle. A lasting, decisive success is
inconceivable for us without a revolution in Europe... a permanent
revolution verses a permanent slaughter: that is the struggle in
which the stake is the future of man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Trotsky comments, while &ldquo;in the years of reaction, one needed
theoretical foresight in order to hold fast to the prospect of a
permanent revolution, probably nothing more than political sense
was needed to advance the slogan of a fight for power in March
1917.&rdquo; Yet &ldquo;not a single one of the present leaders revealed such a
foresight or such a sense... Not one of them stood the test of
history.&rdquo; <em>My Life</em>, p330. In consequence, Lenin declared
that after Trotsky had become convinced of the impossibility of
union with the Mensheviks, &lsquo;there has been no better
Bolshevik&rsquo;.</p>

<p>In <em>My Life</em> Trotsky also outlines how the Red Army was
organised and how the battles took place which determined the fate
of the revolution, at Kazan and other areas. &ldquo;The first requisite
for success,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;was to hide nothing, our weakness
least of all; not to trifle with the masses but to call everything
by its right name&rdquo;. That was the policy which Trotsky continued for
the whole of his life, never trying to hide the truth from the
working class.</p>

<p>Trotsky accomplished marvels in the revolution of 1905, as
president of the Petrograd soviet, and as chairman of the Military
Revolutionary Committee in 1917, which organised the October
revolution. This, with the organisation of the Red Army, would have
been sufficient to put him in the historical &lsquo;hall of fame&rsquo;. But in
addition Trotsky, with Lenin, was the organiser of the Communist
International - which they both considered of more importance than
the Russian revolution itself. The Communist International united
in its ranks the revolutionary workers of the entire world. It
moved greater masses of people than even were organised in the rise
of the world religions. It offered a conscious leadership to the
inevitable movement of the working class. It could not create these
movements but could take advantage of them and prepare the way for
the world revolution.</p>

<p>That was the intention of Lenin and Trotsky when they founded
the International. The Communist International was intended to
prepare for the overthrow of capitalism and open the way for the
new society of socialism. Its main work was to educate the new
layers and new cadres thrown up as a result of the experience of
the class struggle throughout the world, who would be capable of
undertaking this task. That was the meaning of the work of the
first four congresses of the Communist International. Their
deliberations, with their theses and manifestos, many of them
written by Trotsky, constitute an invaluable primer of
revolution.</p>

<p>But reformism saved capitalism in the revolutionary events that
immediately followed the First World War. The German revolution was
betrayed by the social democracy which rejected the &lsquo;bloody path of
Bolshevism&rsquo; for a gradual, slow and peaceful transformation of
capitalism. Fifteen years later Hitler came to power!</p>

<p>At this early stage, the workers&rsquo; leaders in the Communist
International were still young and theoretically underdeveloped.
But they could have learned, and were learning, in the course of
the great events that took place. The defeat of the revolution in
Germany taught the workers many bitter lessons, and the Communist
Party grew on the basis of this struggle between revolution and
counter-revolution to a party of millions.</p>

<p>In January 1923, after Germany defaulted on its war reparations,
French imperialism invaded the Ruhr. This, with the crisis of
German capitalism, led to the collapse of the currency. The mark
went to billions to the pound. A revolutionary crisis developed in
Germany. But the vacillations of the leadership of the Communist
Party, together with the bad advice of Stalin and Zinoviev, led to
a great revolutionary opportunity being missed.</p>

<p>The 1923 defeat in Germany strengthened the reaction which was
developing in Russia from the disappointment at the isolation of
the revolution and the terrible economic situation of the masses.
The &lsquo;troika&rsquo; of Zinoviev, Kamenev and Stalin gained control of the
leadership of the CPSU and commenced a struggle against
&lsquo;Trotskyism&rsquo;. In reality this was a struggle against the basic
ideas of Lenin and the revolution itself.</p>

<p>The developing reaction in Russia was reflected in Stalin coming
forward with the theory of &lsquo;socialism in one country&rsquo; in 1924. In
February 1924 Stalin published a book, <em>The Foundations of
Leninism</em>, which reflected the orthodox Marxist idea of Lenin
about the impossibility of building &lsquo;socialism in one country&rsquo;,
especially a backward country like Russia. But six months later in
a new edition, he published the opposite idea that Russia had
sufficient resources to build socialism! This was supposed to act
as a consolation for the masses, disappointed by the failure of the
world revolution. In reality it reflected the interests of the new
bureaucratic caste which was seeking control in the Soviet Union on
the basis of the ebbing of the activity of the masses.</p>

<p>Trotsky gave a warning and a brilliant prediction: Stalin was an
empiric who, at that stage, did not realise what he was doing or
where the theory of &lsquo;socialism in one country&rsquo; would end - in the
nationalist and reformist degeneration of every Communist party in
the world. This was a remarkable prediction, brilliantly confirmed
by events.</p>

<p>Trotsky&rsquo;s faction in the Russian Communist Party led a struggle
against the bureaucratic road between 1923 and 1927. They adopted
the programme of extensive industrialisation which was fought
against by Stalin and Bukharin - now lauded by the latter day
supporters of Gorbachev - who wanted to &lsquo;build socialism at a
snails pace&rsquo;. Trotsky, in the brilliant work, <em>The Third
International after Lenin</em>, explained the impossibility of
building socialism in a single country, particularly a backward
country like Russia. He fought for an internationalist line in
foreign affairs and for the restoration of workers democracy in the
Soviet Union, the regeneration of the Soviets and power to be
handed back to the working masses.</p>

<p>He fought against the course of Stalin and Bukharin, and to
certain extent of Zinoviev, in relation to the British revolution,
in which he predicted the general strike of 1926. He waged a
campaign against the suicidal policy of the Comintern of support
for Chiang Kai-shek in the Chinese revolution of 1925-27, which
resulted in the massacre of the communists.</p>

<p>Yet, Trotsky&rsquo;s greatest contribution to world socialism and to
the movement of the working class was his analysis of Stalinism in
Russia. Without his work the movement would have been blind. He
analysed mercilessly the zigzags of &lsquo;socialism in one country&rsquo;
which turned the Comintern from an instrument of world revolution
into a &lsquo;border guard&rsquo; for the Soviet Union. In reply, in 1927 the
&lsquo;Trotskyist&rsquo; were expelled from the CPSU and exiled to Siberia.</p>

<p>In those years Trotsky conducted a struggle, against what he
called &lsquo;bureaucratic centrism&rsquo;. - This was the time when Stalin and
other leaders of the Russian revolution genuinely desired the
victory of the revolution in other countries but, first with
opportunist policies and then with the madness of ultra-leftism,
with the insane theory of &lsquo;social fascism&rsquo; - that the social
democracy and fascism were not enemies but twins - prepared the way
for the victory of Hitler in 1933. The path of the Comintern in the
years to 1933 was one of oscillation from ultra-leftism to
opportunism and back again. In a series of writings Trotsky dealt
with the criminal policies of the Comintern and warned of the
danger of Hitler and the consequences the victory of fascism would
have for the German and world working class. He advocated the
united front of the social democrats and communists in order to
prevent the coming to power of Hitler.</p>

<p>Yet the Comintern learnt nothing from the disastrous defeat in
Germany and even claimed the coming to power of Hitler as a step
towards the victory of the revolution! Even as late as February
1934, when the fascists conducted demonstrations against the
liberal government of Daladier in France, the Communist Party
actually demonstrated together with the fascists. Had they
succeeded fascism could have come to power in France in 1934.
Fortunately the French workers could see what was happening across
the Rhine and forced the union leaders to organise a general
strike. Although only one million workers were organised in the
trade unions four million participated in the general strike as a
warning to the fascists.</p>

<p>Trotsky, who had stood for the reform of the Communist
International and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, now came
forward with the idea of a political revolution in Russia and the
inevitable collapse of the Comintern as a force for revolution.</p>

<p>Subsequently the Comintern was to turn to the tactic of the
&lsquo;popular front&rsquo; which demanded the subordination of the proletariat
to the liberals. Trotsky dealt with this in his writings on Spain
and France. The Comintern tried to distinguish between &lsquo;good&rsquo; and
&lsquo;bad&rsquo; capitalists. Not using a class criterion and utilising the
crisis of the system to overthrow capitalism - but forcing the
workers to support the &lsquo;liberals&rsquo; - disillusioned the workers and
thus prepared the way for reaction. In France certain leaders,
taking this reactionary idea to a ludicrous conclusion, demanded a
National Front with &lsquo;good&rsquo; French fascists and Mussolini against
&lsquo;bad&rsquo; German Nazi fascists! The defeats of the working class paved
the way for war. Trotsky believed that the Second World War would
be a decisive test for capitalism, resulting in revolutions in the
West. And indeed, there was a post-war revolutionary wave
throughout Western Europe. In Britain it brought the Labour
government to power. In France, Italy and other countries it
brought coalitions including the socialist and Stalinist parties to
power.</p>

<p>But this new revolutionary wave was betrayed by Stalin. He was
afraid that the effects of a victory of the workers in other
countries would result in the collapse of the bureaucracy within
the Soviet Union. In the same way in 1936, fearing the effects of
the Spanish revolution within the Soviet Union, Stalin had launched
his murderous purges and prepared the way for the ghastly frame-up
trials of the &lsquo;old Bolsheviks&rsquo; and Trotsky.</p>

<p>So capitalism was saved in this tight corner by the policies of
the Communist parties, and of course the reformists, who continued
the same policies as they had carried out after the First World
War. However, this did not have the same consequences, because the
situation was somewhat different to that which followed the First
World War. What paved the way for the long economic upswing of
1950-73 was the domination of American imperialism in the post-war
capitalist world. At that time America had 50 per cent of world
production. She used her domination to force the opening of world
markets to exports. There was an enormous expansion of world trade,
through the lowering of tariffs and other barriers to trade. This
expansion of world trade gave a temporary extension to capitalism,
but on the other hand it had more progressive consequences as well.
It resulted in the growth of the numbers, cohesion and power of the
proletariat throughout the advanced capitalist countries, and even
to some extent also in tile underdeveloped world.</p>

<p>The policies of the Communist and socialist parties prepared the
political basis for a relative stabilisation of capitalism. But
Stalinism also emerged strengthened from the Second World War. Only
the Marxists understood the change in the situation that had taken
place, explaining the consequences of the victory of the Red Army
and the turn towards the policies of proletarian Bonapartism in the
countries of Eastern Europe. This was a new situation which could
only be explained by using the method of Lenin and Trotsky, not
just by repeating their ideas without taking into account the
fundamental changes that had taken place.</p>

<p>Nowadays Stalin has been completely repudiated by the
bureaucracy, who curses him as being responsible for all the ills
that afflict Russia today. But Stalin was an expression of the
apparatus, the representative of the bureaucracy. It was this which
gave strength to Stalin, which enabled his victory over Trotsky in
the battle between the Left Opposition and the bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Trotsky explained the degeneration of the Bolsheviks which took
place between 1917 and 1924 by the changing conditions of existence
under which they lived. In the chapter on <em>Lenin&rsquo;s death and the
shift of power</em> in <em>My Life</em>, he describes the processes
involved:</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;To absorb a certain philosophic outlook into
one&rsquo;s flesh and blood, to make it dominate one&rsquo;s consciousness, and
to co-ordinate with it one&rsquo;s sensory world, is given not to
everyone but to only a few. In the working masses, a substitute is
found in the class instinct... But there are many revolutionaries
in the party and the state who came from the masses but have long
since broken away from them.&rdquo; (p503)</p>

<p class="fst">With the changing circumstances, above all the economic
situation and the series of defeats of the revolution on an
international plane, they became exposed &ldquo;to the easy penetration
of foreign and hostile ideological influences.&rdquo; Stalinism, Trotsky
concludes, was &ldquo;above all else the automatic work of the impersonal
apparatus on the decline of the revolution.&rdquo; (p506) It was the
dictatorship of the apparatus over the party.</p>

<p>Trotsky further deepened and developed his analysis of Stalinism
in a whole series of works. One of his last works, <em>In Defence
of Marxism</em>, was written in the battle against those who wanted
to change the attitude of Marxists towards the Soviet Union during
the course of the Second World War.</p>

<p>Trotsky maintained that the USSR was a deformed workers&rsquo; state
so long as there was state ownership of the means of production,
distribution and exchange. This is the fundamental determination of
a workers&rsquo; state. <em>Without it there can be no question of a
transition to socialism</em>. But without the necessary workers&rsquo;
democracy and workers&rsquo; control and management of industry and the
state, there cannot be a <em>healthy</em> workers&rsquo; state. The
bureaucracy became a privileged caste, lording it over and above
society and the working class. Unable to take any steps towards a
freer and more equal society, it tried to preserve the status quo,
to maintain a hierarchical society, to increase its own power,
privileges, prestige and income, ruling by totalitarian terror over
the workers. It has taken five decades for these characteristics
which Trotsky saw in 1940 to develop to their fullest extent.</p>

<p>At the heart of the dispute over the &rsquo;defence of the USSR&rsquo; was
the class nature of the Soviet Union. &ldquo;The &lsquo;defence of the USSR&rsquo;,
as interpreted by the Comintern&rdquo;, argued Trotsky, &ldquo;like yesterday&rsquo;s
&lsquo;struggle against fascism&rsquo;, is based on the renunciation of
independent class politics. The proletariat is transformed - for
various reasons in various circumstances, but always and invariably
- into an auxiliary force of one bourgeois camp against
another...</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;The primary political criteria for us is not the
transformation of property relations in this or another area,
however important these may be in themselves, but rather the change
in the consciousness and organisation of the world proletariat,
raising their capacity for defending former conquests and
accomplishing new ones...</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;We must formulate our slogans in such a way that
the workers see clearly just what we are defending in the USSR
(state property and planned economy), and against whom we are
conducting a ruthless struggle (the parasitic bureaucracy and its
Comintern). We must not lose sight for a single moment of the fact
that the question of overthrowing the Soviet bureaucracy is for us
subordinate to the question of preserving state property of the
means of production in the USSR; that the question of preserving
state property of the means of production in the USSR is
subordinate to us to the question of the world proletarian
revolution.&rdquo; (<em>In Defence of Marxism</em>, p17-21)</p>

<p class="fst"><em>In Defence of Marxism</em> answers the ideas of all sorts of
quasi-&rsquo;Marxists&rsquo; who were disorientated by the development of
Stalinism, such as Isaac Deutscher, who wrote a biography of
Trotsky. Deutscher imagined that the bureaucracy could move in the
direction of socialism, that it could dissolve itself out of
existence! Events today demonstrate that this is fundamentally
false. On the other hand, we have people like Tony Cliff who put
forward the idea of &lsquo;state capitalism&rsquo;, that the bureaucracy was a
new social formation. This is also completely wrong.</p>

<p>The economy of a state with 100% ownership is entirely different
to that of the economy of capitalism. The economic laws of motion
of such a society are entirely different to those of capitalism.
For example, there cannot be a crisis of over-production and slump
as under capitalism. The crisis in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe is of a different character.</p>

<p>Moreover, capitalism cannot function without capitalists being,
in the words of Marx, the &lsquo;repository of the means of production&rsquo;.
In an economy of state ownership, the state is the repository of
the means of production. The bureaucrats are not entrepreneurs. As
economic functionaries and managers they are entitled to no more
than the wages of superintendence. Insofar as they receive more
they do so as pure parasites and not as a consequence of their
economic function. A workers&rsquo; state can only function properly
under the democratic control of the workers. Otherwise all the
negative phenomena of Russia and Eastern Europe are inevitable. Or,
in the words of Trotsky, &ldquo;if the Bonapartist riff-raff (that is,
the Soviet bureaucracy - EG) is a class, this means that it is not
an abortion but a viable child of history.&rdquo; (p19)</p>

<p>On the one hand, state ownership has demonstrated it is possible
to utilise the enormous advantages given by a plan of production.
On the other hand, the bureaucracy has now reached its limits and
can no longer even get the results that have been achieved under
capitalism in a boom! As Trotsky explained: &ldquo;The goal to be
attained by the overthrow of the bureaucracy is the
re-establishment of the rule of the soviets, expelling from them
the present bureaucracy... it is the task of the regenerated
soviets to collaborate with the world revolution and the building
of a socialist society. The overthrow of the bureaucracy therefore
presupposes the preservation of state property and of planned
economy. Therein lays the nub of the whole problem.&rdquo; This is a
succinct programme which retains its validity even to the present
day; more than 50 years after Trotsky wrote it.</p>

<p>Trotsky, using the method of Marxism, posed the question: &ldquo;Does
the bureaucracy represent a temporary growth on a social organism
or has this growth really become transformed into a historically
indispensable organ?&rdquo; He answered by explaining that a &ldquo;social
excrescence can be a product of an &lsquo;accidental&rsquo; (i.e. temporary and
extraordinary) enmeshing of historical circumstances. A social
organ (and such is every class, including an exploiting class) can
take shape only as a result of the deepest rooted inner needs of
production itself... the historical justification for every ruling
class consisted in this - the system of exploitation that it headed
raised the development of the productive forces to a new level.
Beyond the shadow of doubt, the soviet regime gave a mighty impulse
to economy. But the source of this impulse was the nationalisation
of the means of production and the planned beginnings, and by no
means the fact that the bureaucracy usurped command over the
economy. On the contrary, bureaucratism, as a system, became the
worst brake on the technical and cultural development of the
country.&rdquo; <em>In Defence of Marxism</em>, p6.</p>

<p>The bureaucracy is now in the position where it can no longer
develop the productive forces. It is now no longer a relative
fetter on the development of society but an absolute brake.</p>

<p>This, Trotsky explained, &ldquo;was veiled for a certain time by the
fact that the Soviet economy was occupied for two decades with
transplanting and assimilating the technology and the methods of
production of the advanced capitalist countries. The period of
borrowing and imitation still could, for better or for worse, be
accommodated to bureaucratic automatism, i.e. the suffocation of
all initiative and all creative urge. But the higher the economy
arose, the more complex its requirements became, all the more
unbearable became the obstacles of the bureaucratic regime... the
bureaucracy... came into irreconcilable contradiction with the
demands of development. The explanation of this is to be found
precisely in the fact that the bureaucracy is not the bearer of a
new system of economy peculiar to itself and impossible without
itself, but is a parasitic growth on the workers&rsquo; state.&rdquo; (p7) This
analysis has been brilliantly confirmed by the current impasse.</p>

<p>Trotsky goes on to explain: &ldquo;The Soviet oligarchy possesses all
the vices of the old ruling classes but lacks their historical
mission. In the bureaucratic degeneration of the Soviet state it is
not the general laws of modern society from capitalism to socialism
which find expression, but the special, exceptional and temporary
refraction of these laws out of the conditions of a backward
revolutionary country in a capitalist environment.&rdquo; (p7)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The October revolution was not an accident. It was forecast
long in advance. Events confirmed this forecast. The degeneration
does not refute the forecast, because Marxists never believed that
an isolated workers&rsquo; state in Russia could maintain itself
indefinitely. True enough, we expected the wrecking of the Soviet
state, rather than its degeneration; to put it more correctly, we
did not sharply differentiate between these two possibilities. But
they do not at all contradict each other. <em>Degeneration must
inescapably end at a certain stage in downfall</em>... twenty-five
years in the scales of history, when it is a question of the
profoundest changes in economic and cultural systems; weigh less
than an hour in the life of man.&rdquo; (p13-15)</p>

<p>The bureaucracy managed to maintain itself for a greater length
of time than could have been foreseen. This was due to the victory
in the war, which they were not responsible for but which reflected
the determination of the masses in the Soviet Union not to be
enslaved by Hitlerite fascism. But as Trotsky then went on to say,
which again has been strikingly demonstrated at the present time,
&ldquo;in the USSR, the overthrow of the bureaucracy is indispensable for
the preservation of state property.&rdquo; (p15)</p>

<p>The coalition policies of the &rsquo;communists&rsquo; in Europe at the end
of world war two were a shameful betrayal of all the ideas of Marx
and Lenin on the struggle against capitalism. They saved capitalism
in this period and gave the necessary breathing space to prepare
the political conditions for the economic upswing. Now the collapse
of Stalinism in Eastern Europe, or as the capitalists prefer to
pretend, &rsquo;communism&rsquo; has given an apparent further breathing space
to the capitalists, further reinforced by the crisis of Stalinism
in Russia.</p>

<p>But this crisis of Stalinism, which was predicted by the
Marxists, is merely a forerunner of a crisis of capitalism in
Western Europe and throughout the world. The next decade will be
one of turmoil in the capitalist countries too. France 1968 was not
an accident. It was a reflection of the inevitable movement of the
working class under conditions of crisis.</p>

<p><em>The Guardian</em>, 22 June, showed the situation that has
developed in America: &ldquo;The average voter has woken up to the fact
that his household income has not improved for 20 years&rdquo;. Quoting a
recent book, <em>The Politics of Rich and Poor</em> by Kevin
Phillips, a strategist of the Republicans in 1968, <em>The
Guardian</em> journalist comments: &ldquo;Now that the figures are coming
in, we can tell just how far the Reagan years swung the pendulum
towards the plutocracy. In 1980 when Reagan was elected, the
richest one per cent in the USA owned just eight per cent of the
national wealth. By 1988 they had almost doubled their share to
14.9%.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are nearly two million American millionaires, over
150,000 deca-millioniaries, (worth $10 million) and 51
billionaires. The net wealth of the Forbes list of the 400 richest
Americans nearly tripled in the 1980s. Chief executives of big
corporations, who earned an average 40 times as much as the workers
in 1980, now earn 93 times more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the shadow of coming events. Exactly the same process
took place between 1920 and 1930, preparing the slump of 1929-33.
Trotsky, in his introduction to <em>The Living Thoughts of Karl
Marx</em>, pointed out that: &ldquo;As a matter of fact, the economic
contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie was
aggravated during the most prosperous periods of capitalist
development, when the rise in the standard of living of a certain
strata of toilers, which at times were rather extensive, hid the
decrease of the proletariat&rsquo;s share of the national income. Thus,
just before falling into prostration, the industrial production of
the US, for instance, increased by 50% between 1920 and 1930, while
the sum paid out in wages rose only by 30%, which meant a
tremendous decrease of labour&rsquo;s share in the national income.&rdquo;
p25.</p>

<p>History repeats itself on a higher level. At least in that
period, the share of the national income of the proletariat
increased. Yet now the share of the proletariat has fallen over the
last 20 years. That means that the contradictions in the economy
have reached an even greater extent than they did in 1929-33. Of
course, when the crisis will be, cannot be worked out with complete
accuracy in advance. It may be some years, or there could be a
collapse even in 1991. But what is certain is that the same
economic causes produce the same economic effects.</p>

<p>The irony of history may be that the Soviet bureaucracy is
preparing to capitulate to capitalism possibly on the eve of new
capitalist economic and social convulsions. The &lsquo;fireworks&rsquo; of
Western capitalism will prepare an inevitable collapse at a later
stage. The crisis that has taken place in Eastern Europe and Russia
is a harbinger of a similar crisis of capitalism in the West in the
coming epoch, in Europe, North America and Asia. There will be a
decay of capitalism world-wide.</p>

<p>How shallow and frail the present economic and political
stabilisation of capitalism is, was shown by the terror of the
world bourgeoisie at the revolution which took place in Romania.
There were even appeals from the Western capitalist powers -
because of the fear of the effects of the revolution - for
Gorbachev to &lsquo;intervene&rsquo; against the revolution in Romania. The
campaign in the press over the defence of the Iliescu government by
the factory workers and the miners was another indication of
this.</p>

<p>There will be enormous difficulties on the road of
counter-revolution in Russia and in Eastern Europe. An explosion is
being prepared in Poland. That is the fear of the ruling class.
They are now clutching at straws, making mistakes together with
Gorbachev rather than against the Stalinist regime.</p>

<p>The reactionary theory of socialism in a single country has been
shown in all its futility and stupidity. Stalin believed that he
had established a regime that would last for a thousand years. He
had no idea of the crisis that would effect his system in a few
decades. The leaders of the Communist International also did not
realise what would happen when they adopted this reactionary
theory.</p>

<p>Now, many of the gains of the October revolution, including the
development of the Communist International throughout Europe and
the world, have been destroyed. From being an instrument of
international revolution, the Communist parties have become a
remnant of national reformist organisations in the different
countries. Each one is more reactionary than the other! In Greece,
they made a coalition with a conservative government, the very
forces which had crushed them in the civil war of 1944-47. In Spain
they split into fragments. Even where the Communist parties remain
a force, as in Italy and France, they have become an agency not of
Stalinism but of the capitalists. They have deservedly suffered
this fate, predicted by Trotsky.</p>

<p>The international followers of Stalin, and all his successors,
were a tool of the bureaucracy&rsquo;s foreign policy. Even now they
support Gorbachev blindly, even though he is moving in the
direction of the restoration of capitalism. In the wake of the
capitalist economic boom, the lefts in the socialist parties were
incapable of orientating themselves. They followed the Stalinists
in the most gullible fashion, propagating the idea that &lsquo;socialism&rsquo;
had been established in Russia and Eastern Europe. Now they are
suffering the same fate as the Stalinists.</p>

<p>Momentarily, with the upswing of capitalism, the right-wing
reformists are riding high. They are degenerate tools of
capitalism. They have abandoned any pretence of &lsquo;socialism&rsquo;. Where
they are in government, in France, Spain, Sweden, Australia and New
Zealand, the &lsquo;socialist&rsquo; governments carry out conservative
capitalist policies. In New Zealand and Australia they have
actually turned to denationalisation. In Germany they abandoned
long ago the pretence of a socialist programme. They are even more
degenerate in theory and in practical politics than their
predecessors in the Weimar republic.</p>

<p>Yet it is in the nature of things that they should behave this
way because they too are in the grip of the world market, the
interpenetration of productive forces on an international scale. It
is no longer possible to operate a purely &lsquo;national&rsquo; policy. That
is the explanation for the movement towards economic unification -
which will not succeed - in the European Economic Community, and
the fact that the other European capitalist powers have come into
the orbit of the EEC.</p>

<p>This relatively progressive development of the productive forces
resulted from the capitalists partially overcoming the crisis in
which they found themselves - expressed in the slump of 1929-33 and
two world wars - by overcoming the national limits of each
capitalist economy. The economy has outgrown the restraints of
private ownership and the national state. This will be demonstrated
even more crushingly in the future.</p>

<p>Indeed, the capitalist world rests on the exploitation of the
colonial and ex-colonial peoples. Throughout the 1980s, $50,000
million was extracted each year from the poorest peoples of the
globe. The repulsive hypocrisy of the capitalists lies in the fact
that they shed crocodile tears, piously pretending to give aid
while using the terms of trade to bleed these countries: giving
with the left hand while taking much more back with the right.</p>

<p>Trotsky&rsquo;s work on the permanent revolution, which was aimed at
the backward countries of the world, retains its full force at the
present time, although the aberration of Stalinism in this field
too created new difficulties in theory and perspectives. The
Chinese revolution, the Cuban revolution and others <em>began</em>
as deformed workers&rsquo; states and will inevitably go into the same
blind alley as the Russian bureaucracy finds itself at the present
time. Nevertheless they were enormously progressive in the sense
that they did for a whole historical period develop the productive
forces which could not be developed in the backward countries under
capitalism. In the three sectors of the world, the Stalinist world,
the capitalist world and the colonial world, the ideas of Trotsky
are an invaluable guide to the new forces of the working class
which will develop.</p>

<p>History has still to say its last word in relation to Eastern
Europe. Eastern Europe and Russia are still in the balance. In
Eastern Europe the programme of &lsquo;socialism in a single country&rsquo; was
carried to a ludicrous extent. The level of economic integration of
the EEC was not reached, let alone that of the United States of
America. Each country was pushed into a separate blind alley, after
an initial period of enormous progress in developing the productive
forces. There was not the control of the &lsquo;market&rsquo; that at least
partially exists under capitalism but nor was there any control
whatsoever by the workers, which is a necessary concomitant to
prepare the way to move in the direction of socialism. The impasse
was reflected in the complete collapse of Stalinism beginning with
Poland and Hungary. In the case of Hungary the Stalinists
themselves initiated the process, probably with the encouragement
of Gorbachev.</p>

<p>In the early decades following the second world war, the
bureaucracy evinced an enormous satisfaction and self-confidence.
In 1960 Khrushchev said to the capitalist powers, &lsquo;we will bury
you&rsquo;! Technically, economically and socially, particularly with the
aid of China and Eastern Europe, this would have been entirely
possible. If the same rate of growth which they had achieved up to
that point had continued they would have outstripped the US by
1980. But the rapacious bureaucracy, the corruption, the
incompetence, the impossibility of developing an economy of state
ownership without the direct participation and control of the mass
of the workers, ruled out any way forward on this basis.</p>

<p>Yet, all the bourgeois theoreticians and the reformist
politicians imagined that the Stalinist system could maintain
itself forever! Now the totalitarian granite foundation that was
supposed to have been built has shown its ineptitude and incapacity
to hold down the working class.</p>

<p>The bureaucracy is split. One section wants to go hack to the
blind alley of bureaucratic control. Another section wishes to move
in the direction of capitalism. With the temporary upswing of
capitalism, which has now lasted for decades, they want to swing
back to capitalism, or rather, to use its pseudonym, the &rsquo;market
economy&rsquo;. There will be an inevitable recoil from this.</p>

<p>What is most striking in all the countries of Eastern Europe and
above all in the Soviet Union itself, is the fear of the
bureaucracy of the working class. There is not a coherent and open
component within the ranks of the bureaucracy with the idea of
going back to the control of the working class as existed in the
days of Lenin and Trotsky. Yet, the Russian and Eastern European
workers have still to say their last word. In the coming battles in
Eastern Europe, in Western Europe and in the world there will be
time over and over again to develop the programme of international
socialist revolution.</p>

<p>The Russian workers have gone through a process of development
over three generation&rsquo;s f, since the revolution. The industrial
workers were diluted by large numbers of peasants, who now of
course have become proletarians. But to a great extent, with the
massacre of the old Bolsheviks, with the massacre of &lsquo;Trotskyist&rsquo;,
the consciousness of the Russian workers has been lost. However,
the new regimes which will come into force still remain to be
tested by events and by history. Very rapidly, the Russian workers
and the workers of Eastern Europe can regain and revive the ideas
of Marxism and its modern equivalent, &lsquo;Trotskyism&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Even in the worst case, if the bureaucracy should succeed in
establishing capitalism, a new October revolution would be
inevitable, but on a higher economic and social level. From ten
million workers, there are now 140-150 million. The regime which
would be established ed would find itself in new contradictions,
particularly as the crisis of capitalism develops on a world
scale.</p>

<p>The Russian revolution has been justified historically, whatever
the vicissitudes which Russia may go through in the next period.
The work of Lenin and Trotsky is imperishable. Armed with the ideas
and organisational methods of Lenin and of Trotsky, the proletariat
will be invincible. Their revolt is absolutely inevitable. The
gains in the standard of living in Europe, America and Japan are
actually welcome from this point of view. They have strengthened
the proletariat immeasurably in comparison with the pre-war
period.</p>

<p>The process of organisation of the international market and the
integration of the world economy, which led to a partial overcoming
of the crisis of capitalism for a temporary historical period, will
on the other hand enormously exacerbate that crisis at a later
stage. The development of the productive forces gave a respite to
capitalism. But this will inevitably turn dialectically into its
opposite. New barriers, new tariffs, will be constructed. There is
the outline of new blocs and powers: a unified Germany and the EEC;
Japan and Asia; the United States, Canada and Latin America. New
and even greater rivalries will develop between the capitalist
powers.</p>

<p>The progressive development of the interdependence of the world
economy will collapse at a certain stage. Inevitably, the further
development of the productive forces on the road which Trotsky
deals with in <em>The Living Thoughts of Karl Marx</em> - the
concentration and centralisation of capitalism to a level that has
never been reached in the past - will,&rsquo; prepare the way for new and
even bigger slumps. The analysis of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky
of the &lsquo;market&rsquo;, was correct. In the fact that capitalism depends
on the unpaid labour of the working class lies the germ of the
crisis which will develop in the future. The very process of
accumulation, or in the words of Marx, &rsquo;over-accumulation&rsquo;, is in
itself a guarantee of crisis in the future.</p>

<p>In avoiding crisis new massive contradictions have been created.
The present &lsquo;prosperity&rsquo; is very fragile. With credit, and with
armaments spending which produces fictitious capital, with the
concentration and centralisation of capital through parasitic
takeovers, the ruling class is preparing future crisis.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the development of the world economy lays the
foundations for international socialism in computers,
micro-electronics and automation. Now it is entirely possible in
the main capitalist countries and in the Soviet Union to introduce
a six-hour day and a four-day week without reductions in pay. This
would give the necessary time for the proletariat to run industry
and the state.</p>

<p>The material, political and social basis of socialism has been
laid. What is lacking has been the consciousness and understanding
of the proletariat and a mass revolutionary vanguard to harness the
inevitable movement of the working class.</p>

<p>Trotsky explained time and again that internationalism is not
for sentimental reasons but because of the integration of the world
economy, which was capitalism&rsquo;s historically progressive task. This
has been carried to an extent which could not have been even
dreamed of by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky. The world economy is
one at the present time. This in its turn will prepare the way for
enormous international movements of the working class.</p>

<p>Now not even the Soviet Union or the US can stand alone. They
are part of a world economy. Brezhnev had to reluctantly abandon
the precept of Stalin about a &lsquo;self-sufficient&rsquo; economy. Gorbachev
has carried this further. But they have not done so with the
purpose of preparing for the socialist revolution but on the
contrary have ingratiated themselves with the capitalist powers.
Gorbachev&rsquo;s leaning on the imperialist powers, appealing for aid to
Kohl, Mitterrand, Bush and Thatcher, is a striking confirmation of
the process sketched out by Trotsky in <em>In Defence of
Marxism</em> of &ldquo;the increasing independence of the bureaucracy
from the soviet proletariat and the growth of its dependence upon
other classes and groups both inside and outside the country.&rdquo;
(p119) A super-power with tremendous resources, yet Gorbachev has
to take out the begging bowl! He can only expect aid because, faced
with insoluble contradictions, he has taken to the road of
counter-revolution and the restoration of the market, i.e.
capitalism.</p>

<p>Trotsky, developing the ideas of Marx and Lenin, explained that
the activities of men and women are decisive. &ldquo;The Marxist
comprehension of historical necessity,&rdquo; he wrote in <em>In Defence
of Marxism</em>, &ldquo;has nothing in common with fatalism. Socialism is
not realised &lsquo;by itself, but is the result of the struggle of
living forces, classes and their parties.&rdquo; (p30) The activities of
Marxists are absolutely vital. Without this the inevitable revolt
of the proletariat would never be carried through to a sucessful
conclusion.</p>

<p>Kinnock, Mitterrand, Lafontaine, Craxi, Gonzales, Hawke and
other leaders of the right wing of social democracy think they are
&lsquo;realists&rsquo;. In reality, they are not superior to the economic
conditions which exist at the present time. They, in the last
analysis, remain as tools of big business, in the grip of forces
which are beyond their control. With the next turn of the wheel, as
the economies change, they will be crushed.</p>

<p>The whole history of the last 70 years has demonstrated the
correctness of the ideas of Trotsky. Again and again the masses
will take to the road of struggle. 1968 in France was a harbinger
of events on an international scale. Inevitably the ideas of
Trotsky and Lenin - for the taking of power into the hands of the
working class - will gain greater credence among the active layers
of the working class and those conscientious intellectuals seeking
a way out of the crisis of capitalism and Stalinism which will
unfold in the coming years.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;liberal&rsquo; face of capitalism in the West has come to the
fore in the last few decades, with the &lsquo;enlightened&rsquo; control by big
business of freedom of speech, of the press and of organisation.
Democracy in the advanced capitalist countries, Trotsky explained,
rested on the &ldquo;spoliation of the colonies,&rdquo; in the same way that
&ldquo;ancient democracy was based on slavery.&rdquo; Democracy is undoubtedly
the most convenient and flexible method of domination by the
capitalists. But inevitably, once the revolt of the masses takes
place, big business will change its tactics, as they did in the
epoch between the wars. It is entirely superficial to imagine that
democracy on a capitalist basis can be maintained.</p>

<p>In the event of the failure of a new wave of revolutions, it
would be inevitable that they will turn to the methods of reaction
of the past. Already in Hungary and Poland ideologists of the
capitalist class are talking about the need for a dictatorship - a
capitalist dictatorship. Walsea in Poland, who began his activity
in struggle against Stalinist totalitarianism, is now advocating
what would be in effect a totalitarian system in Poland, a complete
dictatorship of capital in order to force through the changes
necessary to establish the capitalist system in Poland. In reality,
capitalism will reveal its impasse in the coming period. At the
same time we see the impasse in the USSR. Both Stalinism and
capitalism are doomed. A new wave of revolutions is inevitable and
irresistible.</p>

<p>The outstanding characteristic of Marx, Engels, Lenin and
Trotsky was faith in the capacity and understanding of the working
class to carry through a transformation of society. They understood
that the working class is the only through and through progressive
class which can succeed in preparing the way for socialism.</p>

<p>Only the programme and method of Lenin and Trotsky will serve
the needs and the interests of the working class. The revolutionary
youth must study the ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin and especially
Trotsky - particularly the inter-war works which have great
topicality - if they are to equip themselves for the tasks of
struggle which lie in the future.</p>

<p>As a theoretician Trotsky probably stands, even higher than
Lenin. He stood on the shoulders of Lenin, carrying the ideas of
Marxism in the epoch of Stalinist reaction. The internationalists
who have gathered in many countries of the world should not be
worried by the smallness of their forces at the present time.
Events will teach the masses. We have had a fresh demonstration of
this in the campaign over the poll tax. With the method of Lenin
and Trotsky, forces will be created which will stand the test of
events. In this anniversary year of Leon Trotsky we can say to the
&lsquo;Old Man&rsquo;, we salute you, internationally the Marxist tendency
carries on your work.</p>

<p>We owe a debt of gratitude to that great man, Trotsky. Martyr to
the Stalinist counterrevolution, inspirer, thinker, he will live
forever in the memory of the working class when they achieve
socialism.</p>
