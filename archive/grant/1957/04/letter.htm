Dear
Comrade,
</p>
<p>
As a result of
the discussion some comrades and I had with H. last night, and with
yourself and J. in the past, we have decided that it would be just as
well to write formally to you and the comrades expressing our idea as
to the type of co-operation we envisage.
</p>
<p>
For
us, the development of the opposition inside the Communist Party is
of national and international significance. It arises, of course, out
of the crisis in Stalinism opened up by the Khrushchev report and the
Hungarian Revolution. This movement can become an important lever in
the reorientation and development of a Marxist vanguard, nationally
and internationally. For us it represents a break from the shackles
of Stalinism of the second generation of Communists, and the
development of the Marxist Movement on a world scale.
</p>
<p>
As
we explained to you on more than one occasion, our aim in this
connection is to help with all the resources that we possess both
ideologically and organisationally, the development of this tendency.
We invite suggestions from you on how best we can assist this
development.
</p>
<p>
We
would like to make it clear that there is no question on our part of
domination or dictation either on organisational or political
questions. With the development of our two tendencies against
different backgrounds and with two totally different histories, there
are bound to be different ways of looking at things, different
methods of work, different ideological bases. But it is precisely the
differing backgrounds that could be so valuable in the coming
together of these two tendencies which can mutually enrich and
fructify one another&#8217;s conceptions and work.
</p>
<h4>The fusion of
two tendencies</h4>
<p class="fst">
For
us it is a question of the fusion of two tendencies of Communism, of
the International Communist Movement, which broke away at different
stages from the swamp of Stalinism. Unless these two tendencies can
find a way of coming together, great damage can result to both, and
the development of a Marxist Movement in Britain could be impeded for
many years. That is why we consider it so important to arrive at a
common agreement and a common understanding of the basic problems
that face the workers&#8217; movement.
</p>
<p>
Of
course we recognise that it is inevitable there should be suspicion
and even distrust, first, as a consequence of the painfully
disillusioning experience of the betrayal of Stalinism, and secondly
because of the differing backgrounds of the two tendencies. We think
that it is a natural and, indeed, very healthy development that the
comrades should wish to re-examine all the basic arguments, in the
light of their own experience in the Communist Party and mass
movement in the past period; this in an endeavour to find the correct
way of building the Marxist tendency in Britain.
</p>
<p>
One
of the positive features of the betrayal of the Communist Party is
that the militants, both workers and intellectuals, who have had
their eyes opened, are not prepared to accept anything on trust, or
the mere say so of any individual or organisation. This can be a
great gain for the movement, it means that any tendency which is not
scrupulously honest and democratic will, quite rightly, be rejected.
A Marxist movement requires, not automatons or dummies, but a
healthy, democratic discussion on policy, tactics, method of work and
organisation, in order to develop a party and leadership which can
fulfil its historic mission.
</p>
<h4>A discussion
on principles</h4>
<p class="fst">
We
on our part, of course, stand by the basic ideas and principles of
our movement. These are not new principles but the ideas of Marx,
Lenin and Trotsky applied to modern conditions; theory, as of course
you are fully aware, is not an exotic growth but a guide to action.
At the same time, because of the weakness of our forces in the past
epoch it has not been possible to apply these ideas in action, in
Britain, as far as the mass movement is concerned. The current which
is now issuing from the Communist Party has a great experience of
mass work which can make an extremely valuable contribution.
</p>
<p>
We
have no intention of trying to dictate or impose the acceptance of
all our ideas on the Movement; on the basis of joint agreement on
fundamental principles which we have in common, in relation to the
national and international tasks (Soviet Union, the need for Marxism,
the role of Stalinism in the last ten years, etc.) at the present
time; on the basis of working together, we are confident that any
disagreements will be ironed out in the mutual clarification which
will take place.
</p>
<h4>A joint
enrichment</h4>
<p class="fst">
Our
ideas and the fresh ideas and methods of work of your tendency, if
joined together, can fertilise and enrich the stock of Marxism. Out
of the coming together of these two currents of Communism can come
the synthesis of a flexible party with bold initiative so far as mass
work is concerned and which will, at the same time, base itself on
the theories and methods of Lenin and Trotsky.
</p>
<p>
This
letter is not a finished document but the jotting down of a few
ideas, in order to put our relations on the firm basis of mutual
trust and goodwill. We are confident that working together can ensure
mutual confidence and loyalty between us in order to achieve the main
task: the training of Marxist cadres on a national scale which will
form the basis for building the mass party, by the adoption of one
tactic or another in the coming epoch. By our common work and
experience we will arrive, I am sure, at agreement on this. This of
course is not the immediate task that confronts you.
</p>
<p>
However
without our coming together within the next year or so, perhaps more,
perhaps less, we believe serious damage can be done to both
tendencies, and can delay the building of a Marxist current in
Britain for many years. An exceptional opportunity has been given,
which is only too rare historically, of clarifying and preparing
organisationally and politically the cadres, for the great tasks that
lie ahead in Britain, in the next epoch. For our part we would not
wish to do anything which would prevent the coming together, or would
drive apart these two equally important trends, which are so vitally
necessary for the development of the Marxist tendency in the British
Labour Movement.
</p>
<p>
Yours
fraternally,
</p>
<p>
G.E.
