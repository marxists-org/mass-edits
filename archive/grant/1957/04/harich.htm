The
deep-seated disease that rots the regimes in Eastern Europe and Russia is once
again revealed by the ten years' imprisonment of Harich. In an unconsciously
humorous way-if the circumstances were not so tragic-<em>Democratic German Report</em> (the Stalinist journal) indicates that not
only in Hungary and Russia, but throughout the Soviet zone, the Stalinists have
returned openly to some of the monstrous methods of Stalin-which in fact they
had never really abandoned.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#34;A
number of witnesses for prosecution and defence were examined by the court.
Three of the witnesses-the editors Gustav Just and Heinz Zoeger, and the radio
commentator Richard Wolf-were arrested in court after giving evidence, under
&#8216;urgent suspicion of participation in the conspiracy inimical to the state.'
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#34;<em>German Report</em>
is unable to present a first-hand report of the trial since no facilities were
extended for foreign journalists to attend the trial. The nearest relatives of
the accused were unable to attend the trial.&#34; (<em>Democratic German Report</em>, March 15<sup>th</sup>, 1957, p. 39.)
</p>
<h4>An opposition develops</h4>
<p class="fst">
However,
the significance of the Harich events is not the reaction of the authorities,
but the development of opposition within the ranks of the Socialist Unity
Party, as in other parties in the satellites. It is a reflection on East German
soil of the ferment in Hungary and Poland.
</p>
<p>
Harich, and
a number of other functionaries of the Socialist Unity Party, through their own
experience have come to understand that there is no way forward for the masses
or the economy on a Stalinist basis. According to <em>Democratic German Report</em>, quoting the indictment:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#34;Harich
had made the plan to issue a series of appeals, in which the members of the
Socialist Unity Party should be called upon to turn their backs on the Party
leadership; the Soviet Government and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
should be appealed to adopt a position of neutrality or to support a
reorganisation of the government of the German Democratic Republic. Other appeals
were planned calling for the formation of &#8216;workers' and soldiers' Councils,'
and the population should support these councils against the organs of the
State Security and the People's Army.&#34; (p. 40)
</p>
<h4>The &#34;crime&#34; of workers'
councils</h4>
<p class="fst">
So to call
for workers' councils or factory committees becomes a crime in the alleged
countries of socialism! The bureaucracy has degenerated so far from the
conceptions of Lenin that they can publish this without even noticing its
significance.
</p>
<p>
The
statement of Harich as published in <em>The
Observer</em> (March 17<sup>th</sup>) shows two things: on the one hand, the
inevitable development of opposition as the result of the system of repression
and bureaucratic privilege, and, on the other, the frightful confusion that
Stalinism has sown even among the best elements that remain within the ranks of
the Stalinist parties.
</p>
<p>
From the
reports of the trial, and Harich's document itself, we have the-at first
sight-incredible position of Harich appealing from the minions of Khrushchev in
Germany to the masters in Moscow. It is an appeal against the little devils
directed to the Chief Devil himself!
</p>
<p>
At the same
time, we see the disastrous results, the ideological confusion and decay sown
by Stalinism, in Harich's search for a special &#34;German road to socialism.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Trotsky had
predicted the inevitable nationalist degeneration of the Communist Parties,
which we see taking place both inside and outside the Soviet bloc. This is
reflected in the ideas of even such oppositional currents as Harich's.
</p>
<h4>Points of confusion</h4>
<p class="fst">
However,
all these aberrations will be sorted out in the struggle against totalitarian
Stalinism. Harich's confusion of mind is best indicated by the fact that he
considers that socialism has been built in the Soviet Union. He is, of course,
correct in supporting the U.S.S.R. as a <em>workers'
state</em>, but the Stalinist abominations of Khruschevism are proof in
themselves that it has not yet reached the position of socialism. Harich
supports the ideas of Trotsky, though he grasps the degeneration of Soviet
society only in a confused way.
</p>
<p>
It is
unfortunately clear that he has not read Trotsky's later works: he is not even
familiar with the circumstances under which the struggle between Trotsky and
Stalin was originally waged. He believes the lie, assiduously disseminated by
the Stalinists, that Trotsky opposed the industrialisation of the U.S.S.R.
advocated by Stalin.
</p>
<p>
The
situation was exactly the reverse. Stalin opposed the Five Year Plans when they
were put forward by Trotsky as part of the Platform of the Opposition. In fact,
this was one of the reasons given for the expulsion of the Trotskyists in 1927.
Later, Stalin adopted this programme in a caricatured form.
</p>
<p>
The real
issues in the struggle of 1923-7 were workers' democracy versus bureaucratic
privilege, and internationalism versus nationalism. The crisis in the Soviet
Union and its satellites is a vindication of the position taken by Trotsky.
Victor Serge, in his book <em>From Lenin to
Stalin</em>, wrote that if the works of Trotsky were published in the Soviet
Union the bureaucracy could not maintain itself in power for 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
The events
are a demonstration of the truth of this fact. However, the lack of a clear
historical and social analysis results in the throwing back of the movement
ideologically, as well as in every other way. A lot of Harich's ideas still
show the marks of the Stalinist school. A whole generation has been retarded in
its theoretical development through the isolation of the Trotskyist vanguard.
</p>
<h4>Reformist illusions</h4>
<p class="fst">
This leads
to tremendous dangers for the development of the Opposition (and not only in
Germany). Harich, having courageously broken with Stalinism, has developed many
illusions in reformism. He even conceives of the social democracy of Western
Europe carrying through the transition to socialism.
</p>
<p>
He believes
that this social democracy can achieve the unity of Germany peacefully and
without a tremendous struggle; that, on the one hand, the capitalists will
accept this position without resistance, and that on the other hand the
bureaucrats in Eastern Germany will not fight for their privileges. The attempt
to &#34;convert&#34; big business would have the same effect as his disastrous &#34;appeal&#34;
to the bureaucracy.
</p>
<p>
The
illusions in Stalinism in this respect are illustrated by his references to the
eighth Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, and their measures in relation
to organisation. This did not prevent the Chinese C.P. from supporting the
murder of the Hungarian revolution or itself being a thoroughly Stalinised
Party.
</p>
<p>
Mixed with
some very healthy ideas are some Stalinist ones. He puts forward these demands:
No more privileges for leading functionaries, workers' councils, the raising of
the standard of living, democratic centralism correctly applied, abolition of
the secret police, dismissal of Stalinists from the Party.
</p>
<h4>Relics of Stalinism</h4>
<p class="fst">
At the same
time, he speaks of elections on a single list system, which is the essence of
totalitarianism. Instead of the rule of the workers' councils, he puts his
faith in the rule of Parliament. Even on the question of achieving unity, he
does not see that the dynamic overthrow of the regime in Eastern Germany and
the installation of workers' democracy would be the greatest blow that could be
struck against West German capitalism; it would undermine its power completely.
</p>
<p>
We are
certain that, given the time, the ideas of Wolfgang Harich would have become
clarified, and that he would have adopted a consistent Leninist position. He
understood, for example, the significance of the 20<sup>th</sup> Congress. &#34;The
20<sup>th</sup> Party Congress was an attempt to anticipate threatening
revolution from below by revision from above, and to keep control in the hands
of the apparatus. It could not succeed in practice because the existence of the
apparatus is itself the chief obstacle to revision.&#34;
</p>
<p>
As a
characterisation of the situation, nothing need be added. Through his own
experience, Harich had come to understand the contradiction between the
Stalinist apparatus methods and the economic base. A plan of production, if it
is to use to the maximum the possibilities latent within the nationalised
economy, must have the full participation and democratic control of the masses.
</p>
<p>
Stalinism
is in a blind alley; that it will be overthrown is proved by the events in
Russia, Poland, Hungary-and now by the case of Wolfgang Harich.
