<p class="fst">
For
the first time for many years at least the semblance of a discussion
is taking place at the Communist Party Congress and in the
pre-Congress period. This is not at all at the volition of the
leadership, but is caused largely by international events having
their reflection within the ranks of the Communist Party. But it is
only necessary to analyse the resolutions presented at the Party
Congress to see how far the Communist Party still remains from the
principles, methods, organisation and policy of revolutionary
Marxism.
</p>
<p>
Any
perplexed rank-and-file militant has only to ask himself why all the
Communist Parties in the world have made the same &#8220;mistake&#8221; in
relation to developments in the Soviet Union and the Peoples&#8217;
Democracies and the policies in relation to them. It might be
accepted that this or that leader, that this or that party, might
honestly have been mistaken in relation to these events. But when all
the leaders and all the Parties, unanimously repeat the same errors,
the same lies, the same distortions, the same falsifications, then
clearly, from a Marxist point of view, something more than a mistake
is involved. It is a question of a current, a trend, a tendency.
</p>
<h4>Were
they deceived?</h4>
<p class="fst">
When
faced with a similar betrayal on the part of the Second
International, which had trampled on all the principles of socialism
in the First World War, Lenin explained this very clearly.
</p>
<p>
We
see a similar process here. If it is argued that the leadership of
the Communist Party in Britain, as in other countries, has made a
mistake&#8212;a mere detail, to confuse democracy with totalitarianism,
socialism with autocracy, then would it not require a thorough going
and honest analysis of the policy of the party nationally and
internationally for the last few decades? Is it possible to take
seriously the claim that all the leaders in all the parties were
deceived for decades without knowing what was going on? If it is said
they did not believe the capitalist press, why did the leaders of all
the Communist Parties in all the countries deliberately falsify and
lie about the criticisms made by those who were true to the teachings
of Marx and Lenin? This in all the main countries of the world? Why
did people like Rothstein, Campbell, Dutt, Page Arnot consciously
falsify and distort the history of the Russian revolution, the
history of their own party and the policies of the past? This cynical
distortion of the past became a profession on the part of the leaders
of the Communist Party.
</p>
<h4>Theory
is indispensable</h4>
<p class="fst">
A
honest party leadership which remained true to the principles of
Marxism would have made a thorough going analysis of the history of
their own party and of the great international events of the past, in
order to educate the membership and make certain that never again
should such mistakes be repeated. Apart from a flexible and
democratic organisation, apart from the questions of programme and
policy, there is the question&#8212;an indispensable necessity for a
revolutionary party&#8212;of raising the theoretical level and
understanding of the membership. That would be some sort of safeguard
against &#8220;mistakes&#8221; of such a character occurring again.
</p>
<p>
In
analysing these &#8220;mistakes&#8221; of Stalin, John Gollan says: &#8220;While
some may complain that critics were too severely handled&#8212;clearly,
while a few critics were being harshly dealt with, there did not
appear to have been any indiscriminate and hurried elimination of the
opposition basis among the people.&#8221; Thus the monstrous abominations
of Stalinism which disgrace the very ideas of socialism, the
deportation of entire peoples, the murder of tens of thousands of
oppositional communists, the frame-up and ghastly forced confessions
of innocent people, the systematic dissemination of anti-Semitism,
the terror against the working class, are all dismissed as &#8220;errors,&#8221;
but as Cliff Rowe says (<em>World News</em>,
16<sup>th</sup> March, 1957),
&#8220;Marxism is not murder, hypocrisy and victimisation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The
Draft Political resolution before Congress says: &#8220;Building upon the
achievements of the Soviet people, and on what was positive in
Stalin&#8217;s work, but at the same time exposing and rectifying
Stalin&#8217;s errors, the 20<sup>th</sup>
Congress was of fundamental importance for the development of the
whole Communist movement.&#8221; &#8220;Errors&#8221; of Stalin are spoken of as
if it was a question of secondary mistakes in policy instead of the
fundamental principles of Marxism and socialism which were being
defiled and violated. So far as the &#8220;positive&#8221; features of the
work of the Stalinist regime are concerned, and by this is meant the
tremendous development of the forces of production in the Soviet
Union, these arise from the advantages of the abolition of private
property, from State ownership and the plan.
</p>
<p>
The
Stalinist regime in reality has been a fetter on the expansion of
industry which developed despite the arbitrary rule of the
Bureaucracy. By the Purge of 1936-39 production was reduced almost to
a standstill. In 1938 production of steel was 18 million tons. In
1940 production of steel was [still]
18 million tons. That was one of the results of Stalin&#8217;s
leadership.
</p>
<p>
The
bureaucracy was and is a terrible drag on the development of Soviet
Russia. In all fields of Soviet life
the dead hand of bureaucratism is holding up the full benefits which
could be achieved by the abolition of capitalism.
</p>
<p>
An
example of this, and it could be multiplied by tens of thousands, is
given by Khrushchev himself. It is of a Ministry sending scrap metal
2,000 miles to a place sending similar metal the same distance in the
opposite direction. What is more&#8212;and this Khrushchev does not say,
is that enterprising managers must bribe their way to the provision
of essential materials. It is significant that the Communist Party in
this country has neither published nor analysed this 20,000-word
speech.
</p>
<p>
However,
despite all their efforts and their panic, the bureaucracy cannot
solve this problem. The latest effort, the so-called decentralisation
will not correct these abuses; it is merely transferring the problem
from Peter to Paul. The bureaucracy will do anything to find a
solution except the only certain one&#8212;de-bureaucratise itself. The
masses will have to do that. And that is why a political revolution
on the lines of that in Hungary is inevitable in Russia. For the full
development of the productive forces it requires the democratic
control of the masses, otherwise bureaucratic excess and tyranny are
inevitable.
</p>
<h4>Lenin&#8217;s
teachings on &#8220;mistakes&#8221;</h4>
<p class="fst">
Lenin
trained and educated the cadres of the Bolshevik Party on a thorough
analysis of the great events of the epoch, of the Revolution of 1905,
the Paris Commune, of Imperialism and the lessons of the First World
War: of the betrayal of reformism.
</p>
<p>
Over
and over again Lenin hammered home the lesson that mistakes developed
consistently cannot arise arbitrarily. That ideas and methods do not
drop from the skies, but when put forward and reflected by whole
strata of a party claiming to represent the workers, must have a
common origin and a material base. The &#8220;mistakes&#8221; of Khrushchev
and Stalin, like the &#8220;mistakes&#8221; of MacDonald and Gaitskell, of
Kautsky and Sir Tom Williamson, arise from their social role and
function.
</p>
<p>
The
one tendency is the representative of the bureaucracy within the
working class under the conditions of imperialism, the other is the
representative of the bureaucracy which has seized power and runs the
State in the interests of the millions of officials and no longer in
the interests of the working people.
</p>
<p>
If
the leadership of the Communist Party were really sincere in claiming
that it has learned from the mistakes they have only to pose the
question to themselves&#8212;what were the principles on which Lenin
built the Soviet State in 1917? What are the principles of socialism
put forward as the guiding ideas of Marxism by Marx and Engels? All
the leaders of the Communist Party, in all countries, cannot be
politically illiterate. Most of them have read the works of Marx and
Lenin. Therefore they understand that these ideas have nothing in
common with the regimes established in Eastern Europe.
</p>
<p>
The
fact that everywhere it is the same story, everywhere the same
excuses, the same bland assurances are trotted out in the self-same
phraseology is a proof of the fact that there is an organic
connection between the policies they pursue and the regime in Moscow.
From being instruments to establish world socialism they have become
an agency of the foreign policy of the bureaucracy in Russia. Their
material interests as functionaries and officials have become linked
up with the interests and fate of the bureaucracy in Moscow. It is
not a question of lack of knowledge, of misunderstanding but of
material interests of the bureaucracy.
</p>
<h4>Technocrats
and workers</h4>
<p class="fst">
Lenin,
in the early years of the Soviet regime, had referred to the
differentiation between technicians and workers as a capitalist
difference, as a survival of capitalism which they should get rid of
as speedily as possible. Instead of this and the concomitant
withering away of the state which Lenin foresaw as an organic part of
the development of the transition to socialism, the opposite process
is taking place.
</p>
<p>
On
these and related questions the theoreticians of the Communist Party
are silent!
</p>
<p>
The
C.P. leaders turn to the policies of Moscow, like the drunkard to his
liquor. Their protestations of error are as valid. &#8220;I swore, but
was I sober when I swore?&#8221; The intoxication of Stalinism continues
to be the mainspring of the policy of the Communist Party leadership.
While admitting the crimes of Stalin and Rakosi, the leadership
continues to pursue the same method of Stalinist slander and lies
when dealing with the movement of the Hungarian people. Yesterday as
faithful lackeys of the Stalinist bureaucracy, they declared Tito,
Slansky, Rajk and Gomulka to be Fascist and imperialist agents<sup class="anote"><a name="doc-1" href="#foot-1">1</a></sup>,
just as before that they had declared the old Bolsheviks who carried
through the revolution to be agents of Hitler. <em>Even
after the 20<sup>th</sup> Congress</em>, through the <em>Daily
Worker</em>, they slandered the uprising of the
Polish workers in Poznan<sup class="anote"><a name="doc-2" href="#foot-2">2</a></sup>
as the work of &#8220;Fascist&#8221; and &#8220;imperialist spies&#8221; and
&#8220;diversionists.&#8221; This lie, like the lies about Tito and Rajk,
they have had to swallow at the behest of their masters. However,
with calculated cynicism, this does not prevent them from smearing
the movement of the Hungarian masses with the same methods.
</p>
<h4>What
happened in Hungary</h4>
<p class="fst">
Their
explanation of the situation in Hungary is false to the core: 
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Peaceful
demonstrations of the people were exploited for the purpose of armed
action by counter-revolutionary and fascist elements linked with
western imperialist agencies, whose aim was to restore capitalism and
landlordism and take Hungary into the imperialist camp. This
challenge was met by the formation of the Kadar government, which,
with the requested aid of the Soviet forces, defeated the
counter-revolution, preserving the gains of the Hungarian people and
safeguarding world peace.&#8221;
</p>
<p class="fst">
The
Hungarian revolution was the acid test of socialist policy. The
masses wanted socialist democracy, even according to the reports of
the <em>Daily Worker</em>
itself, before the &#8220;line&#8221; was changed with the second Russian
intervention. If the Kadar government really represented the masses
<em>and not the counter-revolution</em>
in Stalinist form, it would have based itself on the soviets or
workers&#8217; committees, as Lenin did in 1917. But instead of this,
with the assistance of Russian bayonets, the workers&#8217;, soldiers&#8217;
and students&#8217; councils were forcibly dissolved. In their place has
come the puppet government which uses the same revolting methods of
Rakosi and Stalin, in an endeavour by crude terror to maintain the
rule of the apparatus. It has even been foreshadowed that new show
trials on the lines of those of Stalinism in its bestial phase will
once again be staged in Budapest as a warning and a threat to the
masses. In their political programme the Stalinist leadership in
Britain, with solemn mien, and not even the trace of a smile, declaim
righteously that they stand for the rights of free speech, press and
association, for the right to strike and all the other hard-won
rights of the working class which the British workers have wrested,
even under capitalism. One decent act is worth a ton of propaganda.
How can we take them seriously when they declare that they have
learned from their <em>mistakes</em>.
They beat their breasts and pretend to bewail the &#8220;violation of
socialist legality&#8221; by Rakosi and Stalin, but they are hiding and
concealing the crimes of Kadar. Arrest without trial, the death
penalty for striking, deportations, police terror, and all the
familiar features of Stalinist misrule.
</p>
<p>
The
contrast between words and deeds is a proof of the fact that the
Stalinist leadership remains a Stalinist leadership.
</p>
<h4>Nationalism
and internationalism</h4>
<p class="quoteb">
&#8220;Stalin
defended the unity of the Party against factional disruption after
the death of Lenin, and conducted a victorious fight for the
principles of Marxism-Leninism, against tendencies that would have
destroyed the party in the Soviet Union. He carried forward Lenin&#8217;s
policy of socialist industrialisation and collective agriculture with
determination, because he believed in the possibilities of building
socialism in one country&#8230;Stalin stood for and defended the basic
principles of socialism.&#8221; 
</p>
<p class="fst">
The
leadership of the Communist Parties, not only in Britain but
throughout the world try and separate the policy of Stalin in his
later years from the policy of Stalin up to 1934. In reality, Stalin
destroyed the party. And it was the theory of socialism in one
country which laid the basis for the criminal degeneration of
Stalinism. It laid the basis for the oppression internally of the
peoples of the Soviet Union with the worst form of Great Russian
chauvinism. It laid the basis for the oppression of the peoples of
Eastern Europe which was one of the factors leading to the uprising
of the Polish and Hungarian people. What basic principle of socialism
did Stalin stand for when he seriously considered, according to
Khrushchev, the deportation of the entire population of the Ukraine,
fifty million men, women and children? All that deterred him was not
the basic principles of socialism, but that he regretfully arrived at
the conclusion that he had no place to put them, and that it would
have been too big an operation.
</p>
<p>
The
tragic blunders and mistakes of the Communist Parties throughout the
world can in the last analysis be traced to this so-called theory.
Lenin&#8217;s policy was based on internationalism, not from the point of
view of sentiment, but from the organic interdependence of the entire
world. In the period since Lenin wrote, the technical development of
the world has further underlined the interdependence of the world
economically, socially, politically. Marxists have always explained
that the historical function of capitalism was the development of the
productive forces so that the material basis of communism could be
created. The creation of national states was an indispensable part of
this process. But now the whole situation in Europe and the world
shows that the development of the productive forces has gone beyond
the framework of the private ownership of the means of production on
the one side and the reactionary national states on the other.
</p>
<h4>Great-nation
chauvinism</h4>
<p class="fst">
One
of the things that shows the reactionary character of Stalinism was
the failure to organise the federation of Balkan States organically
linked with the Soviet Union. With an international division of
labour the standards could have been increased in all these countries
together with Russia, similarly in relation to China. Stalinism could
not do this because it would require the conscious participation and
control of the plan through workers&#8217; councils, consumers&#8217;
committees, and other means of ensuring the participation of the
entire people in the construction of socialism. Instead we have the
national states remaining as puppet regimes to be exploited and
oppressed in the interests of the Russian bureaucracy.
</p>
<p>
The
propaganda of the &#8220;Communist&#8221; Parties for years has been on
nationalist lines. Now they have rediscovered the virtues of
internationalism: &#8220;the common struggle against imperialism and for
socialism demands the strengthening of working-class
internationalism, with the Soviet Union as its centre.&#8221; This is a
disguised way of declaring the fealty and dependence of the Communist
Parties on the Russian bureaucracy. Support for the Soviet Union, of
course, is one thing, or rather, support for the basic achievements
of the October Revolution, and support for the traitors who have
taken control over that revolution is another.
</p>
<p>
How
spurious is the internationalism of the Communist Party and the
rottenness of its whole programme and policies is shown by the fact
that nowhere is the real basis of internationalism explained nor is
it consistently developed in the propaganda to the masses.
</p>
<h4>Nation
state a fetter</h4>
<p class="fst">
This
at a time when the capitalist class itself is compelled to admit that
the national state has become a terrible obstacle for the development
of the productive forces. One of the advantages of the Soviet Union
and of America is the extent of the area which is united under a
single economy. This explains the tremendous development even under
capitalism of the productive forces in the United States. Today
industry and agriculture are cramped and confined within the narrow
national boundaries of European capitalism. Germany, France, England,
Italy, Holland and the other countries of Europe are not wide enough
boundaries for the full utilisation of productive forces. The
existence of these national states means enormous waste and
duplication of productive resources, of markets, of transport customs
restrictions and so on.
</p>
<p>
The
&#8220;Communist&#8221; pretence to be the vanguard of the working class is
shown in its true light by the fact that even Churchill, Mollet,
Adenauer and the other capitalist politicians of Europe are compelled
to recognise the archaic character of these boundaries, and the
fantastic character of these nation states in the modern world, where
the development of capitalism itself has produced atomic energy, jet
aircraft, and all the modern interconnections between the industry
and agriculture of all of them. They endeavour convulsively to find
some sort of solution within the framework of capitalism by the
European common market and the Schumann Plan, an area of free trade,
etc. These attempts must fail under capitalism because of the
national interests of the different capitalist classes.
</p>
<h4>The
workers must take power</h4>
<p class="fst">
But
this whole situation gives a splendid opportunity to a really
revolutionary party, to really revolutionary organisations of the
working class, to explain the problems to the workers of Europe, and
show the indissoluble connection between the interests of the working
class of the different countries. The problems of Britain cannot be
solved by the workers taking power in Britain alone. It requires the
unity of the working class of all Europe.
</p>
<p>
For
a Marxist party such a situation would have been utilised to drive
home the lesson of the need to struggle for a socialist Britain
united within a Socialist United States of Europe.
</p>
<p>
Here,
too, the nationalist degeneration of the Communist Parties and the
fact that even formally they are not connected in an international
organisation can be traced to the theory of socialism in a single
country. In the early years, at least the formal appearance of
internationalism could be maintained. But once the degeneration had
proceeded to a certain pitch the Stalinists could dispense even with
this formality. The Communist Parties of the world could remain as
tools, even without the formality of a once in seven years trip to
Moscow, to rubber-stamp decisions already arrived at. And the
previous work of Stalinism has so confused the rank and file that
they can abandon the internationalist programme of Communism without
any protests whatsoever. And yet, the whole essence of the Marxist
programme beginning with Marx himself, lays stress on the
international character of socialism and the socialist revolution not
because of pious sentiment, but because of the organic economic
social and political interconnections of the modern world. Two world
wars and the events of the last few decades have demonstrated beyond
the possibility of refutation that the needs and interests of the
workers of all lands are indissolubly united.
</p>
<h4>The
United Socialist States of Europe</h4>
<p class="fst">
It
is not an accident that in a narrow nationalist way the problems of
the colonies which, of course, are inextricably linked with the fate
of the metropolitan countries should be featured, but not a word as
to the fact that from every point of view the fate of Britain is
linked with the fate of Europe.
</p>
<p>
The
resolution complains about the question of Stalinism and
anti-Stalinism being raised within the Communist Parties, but this is
precisely the issue. The Khrushchev revelations, the Hungarian
Revolution and the mass movement in Poland have all shaken the
Communist Parties of the world as they have not been shaken for
decades. The long period when the successes of industrial
reconstruction in the Soviet Union and the victories in Eastern
Europe and China could be used to camouflage the real nature of
Stalinism both at home and abroad is drawing to a close. The complete
shake up within the Communist Party in Britain is an indication that
it will not be possible to muffle the doubts and questioning among
the sincere Communist rank and file by hysterical shrieks and threats
on the part of the leadership as in the past. The hypnosis of
Stalinism has been broken. New events in this country and abroad will
open their eyes even more. Yesterday the Hungarian insurrection,
today the trial of Harich, tomorrow perhaps the trial of Nagy in the
usual frame-up way in Hungary, the day after that new events in
Moscow.
</p>
<h4>Lively
discussion forced</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
leadership has been compelled for the first time for decades to have
some sort of discussion in the party. But even so, it is not a truly
democratic discussion that would be required by a revolutionary party
trying to educate cadres to play their part in the creation of a
revolutionary leadership. The Communist Party pretends to base itself
on democratic centralism. But even today the discussion is proceeding
on the basis of &#8220;bureaucratic centralism.&#8221; Not at all in the way
in which Lenin conceived a discussion should be organised. The only
group in the party which has the possibility of reaching the entire
membership in an organised way is the Stalinist clique or faction
which controls the party. No other tendency or organised grouping is
allowed. Peter Fryer<sup class="anote"><a name="doc-3" href="#foot-3">3</a></sup>
was not allowed to speak to any other branch in the country except
his own on the question of Hungary. How, then, could the members be
informed or be enabled to make an objective estimate of the dispute?
When blocked at every turn and not allowed to make any statements to
reach the party members he was compelled to make statements outside
of the party organisations, he was expelled.
</p>
<p>
It
is true that factions of themselves are not a good thing, but when
there are fundamental differences of opinion, while the party is
discussing the problems, they are the only way in which the
organisation can function in a really democratic fashion. Otherwise
the machine will be able to bring its weight to bear and inevitably
gain the victory. Political differences are not solved by atomising
the opposition. In a Marxist organisation the idea of a discussion is
to raise the level of the membership so that they understand the
basic problems, the fundamentals of Marxism, more clearly. A
discussion can be made the most valuable means of educating the
membership. It is not entirely by chance that even the principle of
democratic centralism because of its caricature by the Communist
Party, has been challenged by the opposition. That is because of the
complete violation, not only of democratic centralism, but even of
the formal democracy of a social-democratic party, by the Communist
Party leadership.
</p>
<p>
On
all questions of theory, which is not an abstract thing, but an
indispensable means of educating the Party for the revolution, the
Communist Party has ceased to be a Marxist party. The opposition must
mobilise all its forces at this congress for a decisive showdown.

<sup class="anote"><a name="foot-1" href="#doc-1">1</a></sup> In
1949 conflict between Stalin and Tito provoked a series of purges in
the Stalinist parties throughout Eastern Europe. Several top figures
were involved. In Hungary former minister of the interior Laszlo
Rajk was tried and executed in 1949, followed by Trajco Kostov from
the Bulgarian CP politburo. In Poland party leader Gomulka was
arrested in 1951. In November 1952 Rudolf Slansky and nine other
party leaders of the Czechoslovakian CP were tried and executed.
