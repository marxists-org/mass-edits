The Tories are using the Industrial Relations Act against the dockers, the
railwaymen and the engineering draughtsmen. The real purpose of the Act was
shown by the statements of Sir John Donaldson, head of the Industrial Relations
Court, when he said that union leaders must discipline and even expel their members, area officials and shop stewards, at the dictates of the court,
if they were not to be in contempt of court, and the unions heavily fined.
</p>
<p>
Thus the &pound;5,000 and &pound;50,000 fines on the T&amp;GWU and threats of further
fines. The motivation behind the Act is to tie the unions to the state and turn
the union leaders and the union apparatus into auxiliary police for the
government.
</p>
<p>
Thus 20 years ago, most strikes were unofficial and the struggle had to be
conducted in the teeth of the opposition of the union leaders, who often expelled militants leading such struggles.
</p>
<p>
The self-sacrifice and struggle within
the unions of left-wing militants,
industrially and politically, has begun the
process of transforming the unions into powerful weapons of struggle in the
interests of their members (especially in the
case of the T&amp;GWU and the AUEW) the
purpose for which unions were organised.
</p>
<p>
The employers and their tool, the Tory government, want to reverse this
process. That is why they are supporting such scab unions as the United Kingdom
Association of Professional Engineers (UKAPE)&mdash;in
order to weaken the unions and the solidarity of the workers; it is also why
the Act, in
effect, protects company unions and scabs
against the closed shop, such as that at C.A. Parsons.
</p>
<h4>Leadership
indecision</h4>
<p class="fst">
The Act and the Tory government are only strong because of the weakness of
the leaders of the unions and the TUC. Cooley, of the Technical and Supervisory
Staffs (TASS), the white collar section of the AUEW, has announced non-compliance with the Act, regarding Parsons. Jack
Jones, the &ldquo;left&rdquo;-wing leader of the T&amp;G, has announced that the
union will not undertake any &ldquo;illegal
actions&rdquo;. The vote on the T&amp;G
executive (18-18) to pay the fines, was
only carried by the chairman&rsquo;s casting
vote. This demonstrates the feeling of the rank-and-file.
</p>
<p>
It is a lack of lead and cowardly indecision by the leadership that
resulted in the USDAW conference voting to register under the Act. The weaker
unions have wavered because of lack of a lead from the TUC and the powerful
industrial unions.
</p>
<p>
Unjust laws passed by Westminster at the behest of the enemy class are not
worth anything when weighed against the power of the organised labour movement.
The jails are not big enough or strong enough to contain the workers who will
resist, if a lead is given.
</p>
<h4>Why
bow to unjust laws?</h4>
<p class="fst">
Let the leaders of the movement remember the martyrs of the past, who made
the power of the trade union and labour movement possible. There could be no
union movement or Labour Party without the courage and defiance and self-sacrifice of the pioneers of the movement.
</p>
<p>
The right to strike, the right to organise, free speech and even the right
to vote, were not given as a gift by the capitalists and their government, but
had to be fought for and won by the blood and toil of tens of thousands of
socialist workers.
</p>
<p>
Let the leadership learn from the example of Jimmy Symes, chairman of the
Liverpool dock shop-stewards&rsquo; committee, a real workers&rsquo; leader in Liverpool, as quoted in <i>Militant</i> No. 103:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Unions weren&rsquo;t built on funds; they were built on the blood and
sweat of their members. The strength of any union depends on its shop floor.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
The miners and the support they gained, demonstrated that the real power
is that of the workers. Not a railway carriage wheel turns, not a ship moves,
not a light bulb burns, not a paper appears, without the labour of the working
class. Why bow to unjust laws?
</p>
<p>
Follow the lead of the national committee of the AUEW and the national
executive of the T&amp;G&mdash;recall the TUC conference; organise an even bigger
campaign against the government and the Industrial Relations Act, than when the
Bill was first put to Parliament; put all the resources of the TUC&mdash;the unions,
the LP and the co-ops&mdash;into a campaign of the
education of the entire working class, on the class nature of the Act.
</p>
<h4>Force
Tories out!</h4>
<p class="fst">
The TUC, on the basis of such a campaign, <i>must organise a one-day general strike for the repeal of the Act; force
the Tories to resign and hold an immediate general election; put forward a
socialist programme for the next Labour government</i>.
