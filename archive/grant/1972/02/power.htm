The
government of big business has brought chaos to the industrial and private
lives of the workers and the people of Britain. They miscalculated the
determination, militancy and solidarity of the miners, and the overwhelming
sympathy and support of the labour and trade union movement.
</p>
<p>
The power
cuts and unemployment, the shivering and the blackouts are the responsibility
of the government. The cause of this crisis is the policy of the government of
keeping wages down while the cost of living has risen astronomically, 15
percent in food prices alone during its term of office. The game is given away
in an editorial in <i>The Times</i> of 15<sup>th</sup>
February which declares that:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;The
strike was not caused by any technical failure in conciliation but by the real
conflict between the demands of the miners and the determination of the
government to resist wage inflation. [i.e. increases to match prices and give
modest rises in living standards&mdash;EG]&hellip; However one has to recognise that the
policy that the government actually pursued depended upon a willingness to face
confrontation and that it has been remarkably successful.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Here is the
voice of the spokesman of big business. The real responsibility of the
government for the crisis is made plain in a following paragraph:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Every
prime minister since Sir Winston Churchill had normally exerted a pressure to
settle wage disputes rather than face the consequences of national strikes&hellip; Mr.
Heath has been working in exactly the opposite way.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Then,
justifying the policy of Heath and the Tories, declares:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Unpalatable as the view may be, the cost of this coal
strike so far and its likely future cost if it is settled as a result of the
Wilberforce report is only a fraction of the damage that would have been done
if there had not been a real determination to resist wage inflation. <i>There really is no way of fighting wage
inflation without being prepared to face major and damaging strikes</i>.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Thus
the naked truth is that the employers, their spokesmen in the press, and their
hirelings in the government have declared war on the trade unions and the
working class. This is not because of the defects in character of Heath, though
he has many, nor his stupidity and inhuman cold calculation which masquerades
as determination, but because of the need to defend the interests of the ruling
class.
</p>
<p>
The
government and the employers look complacently on the blows to the economy
caused by this policy. The state can afford the losses of the Post Office and
the Coal Board so long as the profits of private industry are safeguarded. By
&ldquo;confronting&rdquo; the workers in the state sector and keeping down wages, it helps
the employers in the private sector to do the same at relatively little cost.
</p>
<h4>Profit dictates policy</h4>
<p class="fst">
Pontificate
<i>The Times</i>, the <i>Financial Times</i> and other organs of the press, radio, TV and the
CBI in chorus, the economy cannot afford &ldquo;inflationary wage increases&rdquo;. What
they mean is increases to match the real inflation&mdash;the increase in prices. The
economy can&rsquo;t afford to give a decent standard of living to the miners and
other workers, but it can apparently afford one million unemployed and the
disruption of the economy. From the capitalist point of view, this is perfectly
tolerable.
</p>
<p>
What this
really means is that for the government and the ruling class, profit, and
profit alone, dictates policy.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wage
inflation must be contained&rdquo; That is the parrot-cry. Widows, old age pensioners
and people on fixed incomes will then benefit, is the pharisaical excuse. Yet
every family in Britain could have had an additional income of &pound;3 per week last
year, &pound;6 per week this year and even greater sums next year, if the total
unemployed were productively working. This is a conservative estimate of two
capitalist Cambridge economists.
</p>
<p>
Instead,
more than &pound;15 million per week has to be paid out to the unemployed in benefits
and supplementary income. They are kept in despair and enforced idleness. This
amounts to more than &pound;750 million a year, as a consequence of the fact that
capitalism cannot use the human and material resources of the country.
</p>
<p>
At the same
time, the productive apparatus of manufacturing industry, machinery, buildings
and so on is only used to 60 percent of capacity at the present time. If used
to its maximum extent, it would mean an enormous increase in living standards. Instead
of this, we have the interests of capital determining the policy of the Tories.
Heath, Barber
</p>
<p>
Maudling,
Davies and Carr are determined to keep down the wages of the workers, in order
to guarantee and increase the profits of the capitalists. This is because the
profits of the capitalists are determined by the amount of unpaid labour they
can extract from the labour of the working class. They want to diminish the
share of the workers in the national cake, in order to increase the share of
the capitalists. This is the real &ldquo;secret&rdquo; of the policy of the government and
the cause of the crisis with the miners.
</p>
<p>
The policy
of hard-faced Toryism is in ruins. They completely miscalculated the
determination of the miners and the solidarity of the industrial workers with
their miner brothers. <i>The Times</i> and
the <i>Financial Times</i> have
editorialised in panic about the &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; picketing of the miners. This forms
an example and an inspiration to other trade unionists, who have put in their
claim for wage increases, Heath&rsquo;s &ldquo;determination&rdquo; will bring even greater
determination to the engineers and other trade unionists.
</p>
<p>
<i>The Times</i> complains that Heath is not
personally &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; with &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; trade union leaders, i.e. that he is not
in the position to suborn them from their duty to their membership. The working
class must fight back with the demand that the trade union and Labour leaders
must have no truck with the government of finance capital. Now is the time to
mobilise the entire forces of the trade union and labour movement, in a
campaign within the working class.
</p>
<p>
This
government of capitalist perfidy, malice, stupidity, cruelty, incompetence and
greed for gain, must be brought down. The workers have been roused by the fight
of the miners and the power crisis, as they have not been stirred for decades.
Miners, power workers, engineers, dockers have already moved into action. Let
the employers and their government bear the cost of the criminal policies of
their government. Not a penny off the pay by price inflation!
</p>
<h4>Socialist plan</h4>
<p class="fst">
Let this be
the starting point for the Labour and trade union leaders to wage a joint
campaign for a general election. Let the people decide! The programme for the
general election must be the exposure of the real interests which the Tory
Party represents. Not an incomes policy, which in effect has been operated by
Heath, but a socialist policy to take over the banks, insurance companies and
the 250 monopolies, which control the economy.
</p>
<p>
The working
class would be ready and eager to accept socialist policies at the present
time. Only thus can the right to work and the right to decent standards of
living for the working class, or the pensioners and the sick be guaranteed by a
socialist plan of production, with industry and the state under workers&rsquo;
control and management.
