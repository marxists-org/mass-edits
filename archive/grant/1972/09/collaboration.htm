<p class="fst">
The TUC conference meets in
a year of attacks by the Tory government on union organisations and
standards of living of the working class and of mass unemployment. At
the same time, as a response to this challenge, is the rising tide of
militancy of the rank and file of the organised working class and of
the labour movement.
</p>
<p>
There have been more strikes
provoked by the government and the employers than in any period since
the 1920s and the general strike of 1926. This embattled attitude of
the workers is illustrated dramatically by the strike of the building
workers led by UCATT and the T&amp;GWU taking place while congress is
meeting.
</p>
<p>
To those of little faith who
are always excusing inaction by saying that the workers are
apathetic, the magnificent response of the building workers,
following that of the miners and the railwaymen, to the strike call
is a crushing rejoinder.
</p>
<p>
Though
only one third of the building workers were organised, in response to
a fighting lead, especially by the rank and file stewards and
militants, thousands and thousands are becoming organised in the
struggle for decent wages and shorter hours of work. That should be
an inspiration to every militant trade unionist and every union
leader at the TUC conference.
</p>
<p>
The mood of the working
class is reflected in the resolutions presented for discussion at the
conference. The AUEW (technical and supervisory section) declares:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Congress
re-affirms its total opposition to the Industrial Relations Act
1971&hellip;it calls upon affiliated unions to use all means, both
political and industrial, to oppose its implementation, including
opposition to the payment of fines and appearances before the
National Industrial Relations Court&hellip;Congress will give assistance,
including industrial action if necessary in defence of affiliated
unions victimised under the act&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
This extract shows the
uncompromising attitude of the AUEW and undoubtedly the big majority
of workers and unions represented at this congress. The feeling of
the entire organised working class is expressed in this resolution
and those of other unions.
</p>
<p>
The
resolutions on education, increased pensions, pensions at 60, social
services, against the government&rsquo;s policy of wage restraint, on
environmental pollution and on the steel industry show the temper of
the workers represented at the congress; the one on the steel
industry declares that:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Congress
pledges the maximum support to the affiliated trade unions within the
steel industry in their fight to preserve establishments and
employment in the industry which is being destroyed by the policy of
the present government and the British Steel Corporation of hiving
off the prosperous section of the industry and effecting closures
with no consideration to the social problem which will arise as a
consequence of their actions.&rdquo; (Amalgamated Society of
Boilermakers, Shipwrights, Blacksmiths and Structural Workers)
</p>
<h4>Workers&rsquo; anger</h4>
<p class="fst">
The attitude of the unions&rsquo;
membership, indicating the anger of the working class at the
developments of the last 2 years is summed up in the resolutions on
unemployment, especially that of the Transport and General Workers&rsquo;
Union:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Congress
declares that full employment must be made a major national priority,
and rejects any idea that it will be sufficient if present high
levels are merely reduced.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;In
addition to necessary changes in government policy, however, Congress
believes that the trade union movement must play a major part in
reducing technological and other unemployment, in particular by
pressure for a shorter working year, including the target of a 32
hour week, a 4 day week, 4 weeks annual holidays and additional
public holidays, without loss of pay.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;In
this way, Congress believes that large numbers of jobs can be created
and the proceeds of technological advance more fairly shared.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
It
seems
as if not even the most right-wing union leaders will dare to oppose
this resolution. Around the demand for a 32 hour 4 day week and for 4
weeks holiday, without loss of pay, a campaign must be developed by
the entire movement. The resolutions quoted constitute a programme, a
good programme of social and economic change. This must be taken up
by every active member in the trade union and labour movement.
</p>
<p>
But the weakness, as well as
the strength of the movement is reflected in these resolutions. Who
is going to make a &ldquo;major national priority&rdquo; of full employment?
There is the &ldquo;nation&rdquo; of the T&amp;GWU, reflecting the working
class, and the &ldquo;nation&rdquo; of Heath and the Tory government and CBI,
reflecting the interests of the employing class. These are two
different &ldquo;nations&rdquo; as Disraeli admitted a century or so ago.
</p>
<p>
Their interests are
irreconcilably opposed. In addition the capitalists suffer under the
constraints of their system. There is no &ldquo;fair share&rdquo; between the
tiger and his victim. Technological change is used to increase the
exploitation of the working class, as the docks dispute has
demonstrated.
</p>
<p>
In
last week&rsquo;s <i>Militant</i>,
we quoted the editorial of the<i>
Times</i>
which complained that T&amp;GWU opposition to cheaper labour being
employed on containers was a &ldquo;protection racket&rdquo;. As the voice of
big business, to them technological progress was a means to increase
profit, not to lighten labour, or increase the share of the workers.
From the bosses&rsquo; point of view they are right. From the workers&rsquo;
point of view it makes sense to decrease hours and increase wages to
reap the benefits of science and technology.
</p>
<p>
But it is not a question of
rationality or common sense. This the workers have on their side. But
it is impossible for the ruling class to see it in this way. Hence
the class struggle. Hence the need for the organisation, politically
and economically of the workers.
</p>
<p>
Even more urgent is how to
convert a &ldquo;national priority&rdquo; from a resolution into a programme
of action. All the resolutions mentioned will undoubtedly be adopted
by the congress, but how are they to be translated from resolutions
into reality?
</p>
<p>
The Tory government and the
employers tried it on by using the Industrial Relations Act against
the workers, The arrest of the 5 dockers led to such a wave of
indignation and action by the workers that the TUC by a big majority
threatened a 24 hour general strike.
</p>
<p>
Even before this the
resistance of the workers to the Tory government and employers&rsquo;
offensive was such that the government looked for some other method
of achieving their aims against the workers. The direct confrontation
with the miners, the railwaymen and the dockers had failed. The power
of the unions was too great.
</p>
<p>
Hence
indirect means were needed to cut the share of the wealth produced by
the workers going to the workers. <i>Profit
is the unpaid labour of the working class</i>.
If the share of the capitalists is to be increased, the share of the
workers must be cut. This has been done indirectly by devaluation,
through the floating of the pound, which will inevitably lead to
higher prices.
</p>
<h4>Ensnaring TUC</h4>
<p class="fst">
But fearing even more
powerful resistance to higher prices and mass unemployment, the
government is trying to ensnare the leaders of the TUC in a programme
of &ldquo;conciliation&rdquo; with the CBI and the government, in a
&ldquo;production and voluntary prices and incomes policy&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
Hardly had the echoes of the
struggles which led to the release of the 5 dockers died down, when
the TUC leaders who had threatened massive confrontation with the
government of big business, were meekly again collaborating with
them!
</p>
<p>
This inconsistency can only
act in the interests of the employers and their Tory lackeys. The
haughty attitude of the CBI and the government and their insistence
on introducing the IR Act in order to fetter the movement hand and
foot shows their real attitude. They want the &ldquo;collaboration&rdquo; of
the TUC to save them from the rising anger of the organised workers.
They wish to use the TUC to break the movement of opposition of the
working class.
</p>
<p>
Having used the TUC, if the
radical mood ebbs, they will contemptuously toss them aside. Only the
government and the employers can gain from class collaboration with
the enemy. Kissing the stick that beats them with the IR Act, taxes
and profits legislation, the Housing Finance Bill and so on, cannot
serve the interests of the working class or organised labour
movement.
</p>
<p>
The TUC cannot carry through
or fight for the programme being adopted by this congress and
collaborate with the CBI and Tory government. One or the other must
be dropped. Which is it to be? Are the resolutions to be nothing but
words, words, words, as Shakespeare put it, or are they meant to be
serious guides to action?
</p>
<h4>One million unemployed</h4>
<p class="fst">
The situation is grave,
nearly a million unemployed officially, according to Vic Feather,
much more than a million in reality. There has been a fall in
investment of 7 percent in 1971 and an estimated fall of another 2
percent in 1972. Even if 1973 would see an increase in investment of
the projected optimistic figure of 10 percent, this would bring
investment in capital equipment up to the level of 1970, which was
far below that of Britain&rsquo;s capitalist rivals, or even of the best
previous years. Even if production is increased it will not solve the
problems of the economy.
</p>
<p>
That means that once again
the employers and the government would have to try and redress the
balance by squeezing further profits from the workers. Not from
wickedness or cussedness did the Tory government and the employers
attack the unions by stringent legislation, but because of the
condition of British capitalism at home and on world markets.
</p>
<p>
The capitalists would prefer
compromise and agreements, even of an illusory &ldquo;fair share&rdquo; going
to the workers. But they cannot afford this because of the
contradictions of the system. Hence the inevitability of further
attacks on the conditions and standards of living of the working
class.
</p>
<p>
The needs of the workers are
there, the productive apparatus to produce the goods is there,
created by the labour of the working class over a century. But
capitalism produces for profit and not for need. No profit&mdash;or lower
profits&mdash;no production&mdash;and mass unemployment.
</p>
<p>
Consequently the TUC must
not be used by the employers and their government&mdash;only to be cast
contemptuously aside when they have served their purpose&mdash;but must
break with the CBI and Tory government now!
</p>
<p>
The TUC, together with the Labour
Party and co-ops in the national council of labour must begin a
campaign to force the government to resign. The resolutions of this
congress, together with the resolutions put forward at Labour Party
conference should be the basis of the campaign.
</p>
<p>
A general election following
on an organised campaign, with the mobilisation of the entire Labour
and trade union movement would lead to a new Labour government. But
if the Labour government operated on the same basis as the last one,
it could not carry out the programme of reforms of this TUC congress
or its projected programme. The nationalisation of a few declining
industries like the docks, or even a profitable industry like
pharmaceuticals, although a step forward, would not solve anything
fundamentally.
</p>
<p>
The
Labour government like the last would be compelled to operate like a
Tory government on Jenkinsonian lines so long as 80 to 85 percent of
the economy remained in private hands. Only the taking over of the
350 biggest monopolies, banks and insurance companies which control
85 percent of the economy with minimum compensation on the basis of
need would allow a programme of radical reform to be carried out.
</p>
<p>
Then, a &pound;30 minimum wage,
including pensioners and the sick could be established. Unemployment
would disappear and planned production, involving the unions could be
organised.
</p>
<p>
The state capitalist
nationalisation of the past is inadequate. There must be workers&rsquo;
management and control of the nationalised industries. Workers&rsquo;
management would mean two-thirds of the boards of each industry would
be appointed by the TUC, half of these to be appointed by the unions
in the industry involved and the last third to be appointed by the
government, all members appointed by the TUC to be responsible to the
annual conference and submit an annual report. This is the programme
for which the TUC and LP should campaign.
</p>
<p>
A new wind is blowing
through the organised movement. It will blow away the ideas of
reformism like cobwebs and dust. There is no way forward with the old
discredited methods. In the last few years, for the first time for a
generation and more, there have been national official strikes. The
building workers&rsquo; strike of UCATT and the T&amp;GWU must be
officially supported and aided by the TUC.
</p>
<p>
Ride the tide of aroused workers&rsquo;
radicalisation, the tide of opposition to the employers and their
Tory government. Begin a mass campaign for power! Either this or the
resolutions of congress this year must remain as meaningless and
pious scraps of paper.
