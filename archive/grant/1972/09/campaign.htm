<p class="fst">
The radical mood of the working class against the savage
attacks of big business and its puppet, the Tory government has found
a reflection within the Trade Union Congress discussions. From this
point of view, this year&rsquo;s TUC marks an important step forward for
the trade union and labour movement.
</p>
<p>
The bitter struggles and strikes against the Industrial
Relations Act by large sections of the organised industrial working
class, have had an impact within the unions. This was especially so
with the attempt to bludgeon the railwaymen and the dockers.
</p>
<p>
This has led to a stiffening of the ranks. Even
right-wing leaders like Chapple of the ETU and the leaders of USDAW
and other non-industrial unions like ASTMS issued a declaration that
they would de-register after the jailing of the 5 dockers.
</p>
<p>
Consequently the only unions of any size which declared
they would remain on the register were the National Union of Seamen,
which under its general secretary Hogarth has become virtually a
semi-company union, Equity, representing the actors, NUBE, the
National Union of Bank Employees and COHSE, the health employees&rsquo;
union.
</p>
<h4>Blacklegging</h4>
<p class="fst">
They, together with some smaller unions were suspended
on the first day of the congress by an overwhelming majority. Thus a
modicum of discipline in the face of the attacks by the Tory
government has been restored. To go on the register was an act of
blacklegging. To accept the interference of big business and the Tory
government in regulating the affairs of the unions and to tamely
accept the task of policing their members was an act of disloyalty to
the principles of the trade union movement, especially when other
sections of the movement have been under attack. According to Vic
Feather, only unions representing 2.5 percent of the membership of
the TUC will be registered by the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally the government and the NIRC [National
Industrial Relations Court] are keeping very quiet about the
&ldquo;contempt of court&rdquo; represented by this suspension. Sir John
Donaldson&rsquo;s NIRC wrote a letter to the general council warning them
not to take action against the seamen&rsquo;s union!
</p>
<p>
This partial swing to the left was indicated by the
radical programme of reform on pensions holidays and wages and other
reforms adopted by the TUC. (This has been analysed in the last issue
of <i>Militant</i>).
</p>
<p>
In the elections there was a further swing to the left.
Jack Peel of the textile workers&rsquo; union, an extreme right-winger,
was removed from the general council, though many right-wingers like
Frank Chapple remain. The &ldquo;left&rdquo; however has a nominal big
majority on the general council now.
</p>
<p>
However, the elements of conservatism which remain were
indicated by the defeat of a resolution moved by the AUEW and
supported by the T&amp;GWU which demanded a complete boycott of the
Industrial Relations Act&rsquo;s facilities and urging the TUC to
establish a joint fund to pay fines imposed by the NIRC. This was
defeated on a card vote by 3,439,000 to 5,677,000.
</p>
<p>
This means that despite the pressure of the working
class, the majority of the trade union leaders are not prepared for
all-out opposition and struggle, even in words, against the IR Act
and against the Tory government.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps this attitude was best reflected in the opening
remarks of the chairman, George Smith of UCATT who denied any
suggestion that the TUC&mdash;mighty representative, potentially of
organised labour&mdash;considered itself in any way &ldquo;an alternative
government&rdquo;.
</p>
<h4>Labour
government</h4>
<p class="fst">
But if not so, why are they not waging a campaign to
rouse the workers against the attacks of big business and the Tory
government and the election of a Labour government as an alternative?
</p>
<p>
In reality their programme of reforms is thus doomed to
remain on paper. How are these reforms to be implemented? The Tories
will certainly not accept this programme, especially if there is no
organised action to make them do so. Similarly they will not repeal
the Industrial Relations Act, or put it &ldquo;on ice&rdquo;, but rather keep
it as a reserve weapon unless they are forced to do so by the
organised working class.
</p>
<p>
The real thinking of the General Council was expressed
by Vic Feather, general secretary of the TUC, in opening the debate
when he said they had warned the government that it was time for a
radical change of direction. &ldquo;I believe the government know it&rdquo;
he remarked, &ldquo;l believe that they wish they could get shot of the
whole thing and start off again from square one.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
In other words, Feather and the majority want a nice
horse-deal with Heath and company, who in return for concessions on
prices and incomes will repeal the Industrial Relations Act or put it
on ice.
</p>
<h4>&ldquo;Conciliation&rdquo;
noose</h4>
<p class="fst">
But that was precisely the purpose of the act! If the
TUC will voluntarily roll on its back like a tame cart-horse, with
all four legs in the air, what need of the act has big business?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Voluntary&rdquo; arbitration, voluntarily putting the
unions in the noose of &ldquo;conciliation&rdquo;, cannot solve the problems
of the working class nor bring forward the reform programme of the
TUC. That Heath, Carr, Davies and the crew of the Confederation of
British Industry puppets, are prepared to make such an arrangement,
indicates that big business and its government are in difficulties
because of the strength of the trade unions.
</p>
<p>
They want to use the unions to get them out of a hole.
But any agreements with the Tories or the employers as every active
trade unionist knows depends entirely on the strength and
consciousness of the workers. The moment the pressure of the workers
ebbs, Heath, at a time that suits him, will withdraw any concessions
favourable to the workers.
</p>
<h4>Class
collaboration</h4>
<p class="fst">
The TUC is supposed to be the general staff of labour.
But if they are not prepared to campaign against the enemy&mdash;capitalism
and its hirelings&mdash;but prefers the illusory path of class
collaboration&mdash;that is the meaning of an agreement with the Tory
government&mdash;that can, only mean disaster for the trade union
movement.
</p>
<h4>Concerted
campaign</h4>
<p class="fst">
Instead of this, militants must campaign in the union
branches, wards, shop stewards committees and constituency
organisations for a concerted campaign of the TUC, co-ops and LP to
bring down the Tories and force a general election on the basis of a
socialist programme. A campaign on the lines of sketching out an
enabling act to take over the banks, insurance, land and the 350
monopolies with minimum compensation on the basis of need. The
management of industry and the state to be in the hands of the trade
unions with all officials working for skilled workers&rsquo; wages.
