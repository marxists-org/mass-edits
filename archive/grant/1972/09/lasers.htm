<p class="fst">
Scientists
are studying better methods of exterminating the human race; <i>Lasers
</i>(Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission
of Radiation photons) are being developed in America and the Soviet
Union to increase the power of the H Bomb.
</p>
<p>
They are
not content with possession of the equivalent of 10 tons of TNT for
every inhabitant of the globe, sufficient to exterminate the entire
human race. During the last 2 years America has increased six-fold
the number of scientists and increased the development budget to
nearly &pound;50 million working on lasers. The &ldquo;prize&rdquo; is the
triggering of an H Bomb capable of producing the explosive power of
2,500 Hiroshimas! A pellet of deuterium, the isotope of hydrogen,
will be heated by high-energy lasers to the temperature of the Sun,
10 million degrees!
</p>
<p>
<i>One
such bomb would exterminate the entire population of Britain. But
there is one &ldquo;consolation&rdquo;. There would be no radiation fall-out
to kill the survivors or pollute the atmosphere.</i>
</p>
<p>
That is
the madness o capitalism and the nation state. <i>The
Observer</i> of 3<sup>rd</sup>
September reports &ldquo;Sponsors of the idea discern in this project
some kind of ethical advance&rdquo;!
</p>
<p>
Every
decade, more than &pound;1,000,000,000,000 (a million million) is spent on
arms by the rulers of the nations of the world. This in itself if
spent on factories, houses, schools, universities, roads and other
constructive purposes would be sufficient in a matter of 2 or 3
decades to abolish want, insecurity and poverty on the entire planet.
</p>
<h4>Abolish
disease</h4>
<p class="fst">
The amount
spent on nuclear arms alone, if spent on research into the causes and
cure, could eliminate diseases such as cancer, heart diseases, and
the sanitary diseases such as cholera, insect borne diseases like
malaria and bilharzia.
</p>
<p>
The
pollution of water, food and air is caused by the greed for profit.
This could be abolished if the resources of the countries of the
entire planet could be organised rationally to produce a healthy
environment. This is shown by the suggestion of the production of
electricity by building solar power stations in space which would
produce 5 times the output of most large power stations today.
</p>
<p>
The
technology of lasers and other scientific advances could be
enormously fruitful. Lasers are used in the clothing trade, by
doctors in eye surgery and on Rolls Royce engines. &ldquo;The Russians
have a beam that can carry thousands of telephones conversations or
television channels&rdquo; (<i>Observer</i>
3<sup>rd</sup> September
1972).
</p>
<h4>Use of
resources: a political problem</h4>
<p class="fst">
However,
it is not a technical problem as the rationalists and pacifists
imagine. It is a class and political problem. While capitalism
remains, the resources produced by the labour of the workers will be
squandered on death-dealing devices. Ultimately, if reaction and
racialism succeed they will be used in an H Bomb war resulting in the
destruction of humanity.
</p>
<p>
All the
resources for a world of abundance, without pollution, disease and
squalor, exist at the present time in skill, technique and science.
They are the same resources used to produce pollution and
destruction.
</p>
<p>
They
cannot be used for constructive purposes till the capitalist system
of profit-making is overthrown. Grim reality teaches that the
alternative posed by Marx, Lenin and Trotsky of democratic socialism
or barbarism has been transformed into a united world socialist
society or annihilation.
