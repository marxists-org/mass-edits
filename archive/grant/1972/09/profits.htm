<p class="fst">
The
outlook for the working class is grim. Unemployment by next year is
expected to rise to 1,200,000. The employers and their government are
already preparing a campaign to put the responsibility for this on
the trade unions and the resistance of the workers to the lowering of
living standards.
</p>
<p>
As
<i>The Times</i> expresses it in elegant language:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Companies
generally are now taking a more optimistic view about their prospects
for exports and investment, but the signs are that the employment
situation in manufacturing industry is unlikely to improve from now
on&hellip; given the wage inflation prospect, companies will be more
inclined to shed labour or at least to revise their plans for new
staff.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Despite
the weeping and wailing of the Tories, due to the measures of the
government the big business companies have increased their profits.
Company profits this year and next are expected to be good. Company
profits were up 12 percent in 1971.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Both
the price increases and labour savings that companies have made and
the fact that industrial output can now be improved with little
addition to costs&rdquo; is a favourable factor, says the<i>
Times</i>. This means that the capitalists
regarded the situation complacently. It also gives the game away as
to the cause of unemployment and high prices. An increase in wages,
other things being equal, means a cut in the profits of the
capitalists because, as Marx explained, <i>profit
is the unpaid labour of the working class</i>. If
the share of the workers is cut the share of the capitalists rises.
</p>
<p class="fst">
Capitalists
will always raise their prices if the market will stand it, even if
the wages of the working class are lowered.
</p>
<p>
What
caused the rise in prices has been world conditions and the policies
of British capitalism and the Tory government. Now the basis has been
set for a price explosion to dwarf the present British price level
among the highest of all the major industrial powers. Entry into the
Common Market and Value Added Tax will result in a minimum increase
of 10 percent.
</p>
<p>
The <i>de facto</i> devaluation
of the pound will add to this. The Housing Finance Act and property
and land speculation will pile it on. Up to a 15 percent increase or
more in prices next year is likely.
</p>
<p>
<i>Thus &ldquo;cut prices at a
stroke&rdquo; Heath has brought the biggest increase in prices and the
highest rate of increase of prices since the war.</i>
</p>
<p>
At
the same time these policies have not been tamely accepted by the
working class. The organised workers have fought back against the
attempt to cut living standards. Heath&rsquo;s policy of &ldquo;confrontation&rdquo;
is in ruins. The miners, railwaymen, dockers, engineers, building
workers and others have beaten back the Tory attacks.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless,
there are still 7 million workers who earn less than &pound;20 a week
which with today&rsquo;s prices is below social security supplementary
benefit standards for a family.
</p>
<p>
While
the capitalists have increased profits in absolute terms,
nevertheless industrial investment has fallen. The capitalists have
found it more profitable to invest in office blocks, property,
restaurants and posh housing. So that is where the money has gone.
</p>
<h4>Imports
increased 28 percent</h4>
<p class="fst">
In
addition large sums have gone into investment abroad where greater
profits could be obtained. Patriotism is all very well for working
class suckers but as W.J. Keswick, director of the Bank of England
declared in 1957 &ldquo;re-investing in foreign shares is anti-British
and derogatory to sterling, but, on balance, if one is free to do so
it makes sense to me.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Thus
the vital investment in new capital for British industry has dropped
by 3 percent in fixed investment of plant and machinery this year.
Four and a half years after the 1967 devaluation its effects have
worn off. This was one of the main causes of the accelerated increase
in prices. But now the volume of imports has increased 28 percent
while domestic industrial production is up by 11 percent.
</p>
<p>
The
amount of money in circulation will increase by 30 percent this year
it is estimated. Large amounts have been borrowed from the banks by
property speculators, not by industrialists to buy new plant.
Consequently British capitalism is losing out on its competitors. In
the first half of 1972 the value of exports was 1.5 percent below the
second half of last year and in volume 2.5 percent below. In the
first half of this year imports were 9 percent greater and volume
accounted for nearly all the increase!
</p>
<h4>Maudling&rsquo;s article</h4>
<p class="fst">
Manufacturing
investment in the first six months of this year was 7 percent lower
in Britain than the last half of 1971 and 8 percent lower than the
first half of 1971. This while distributive and service investment
was up by 2 percent in the first 6 months of 1972 over the last six
months of 1971 and 4 percent over the first six months of 1971.
</p>
<p>
But
as capitalist commentators have said &lsquo;&lsquo;a surge in capital
spending is vital for reducing unemployment as well as meeting the
challenge of Europe.&rdquo; Yet investment in industrial new buildings,
plant and machinery (including new vehicles) is 7 percent down on the
second half of 1971.
</p>
<p>
It
is in this situation that Maudling has written an article in the<i>
Times</i> of September 12<sup>th</sup>
demanding what amounts to a disguised but compulsory prices and
incomes policy, in reality a restriction of wages despite the
inflation caused by capitalism and government policies.
</p>
<p>
Maudling admits that the,
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;capitalist
system&hellip;has led inevitably to wide disparities in living standards
and to the concentration of large amounts of wealth in a fairly
limited number of hands&hellip;but we must recognise that this has only
persisted because the majority have not been prepared to use their
potential economic and political power against the prosperous
minority&hellip;We have seen in the last two decades an arising
consciousness of the power of organised labour&rdquo;.
</p>
<p class="fst">
Maudling
is muddled but he sees that the state must intervene openly on behalf
of the capitalists. If only the Labour and trade union leaders were
half as conscious of the enormous power of the labour movement. It is
the pressure and initiative and activity of the active section of the
trade union movement which has really mobilised the workers to combat
the capitalists and their government on all fronts,
</p>
<p>
Let our leaders be worthy of the militant rank and file. No collaboration
in the schemes of the Tories to bind the workers and their
organisations whether through the Industrial Relations Act or an
incomes policy. Recognise what the capitalists and their Tory
representatives understand&mdash;the organised power of the working
class.
</p>
<h4>Fight unemployment</h4>
<p class="fst">
Conduct
an offensive against capital and its representatives. Fight
unemployment with the programme of the last TUC. Fight for an 8 hour
day, 4 day week without reduction in pay and 4 weeks holiday on full
pay. Fight for the full demands of all the unions.
</p>
<p>
The productive potential is there for these demands plus a minimum of &pound;30
a week for all. If capitalism &lsquo;&lsquo;cannot afford&rdquo; these elementary
demands then fight for a Labour government pledged to take over the
350 monopolies, banks, land and insurance with minimum compensation
on the basis of need. Plan the economy to produce abundance and with
workers&rsquo; management of industry and the state through the unions
and the TUC.
