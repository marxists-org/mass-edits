The dock
strike has been &ldquo;settled&rdquo;, the dockers have made some marginal
gains. But the terms of the settlement are practically the same as
those rejected by the dockers previously.
</p>
<p>
The
<i>Financial Times</i>, organ
of big business, comments with satisfaction on this fact in an
article on this agreement in its issue of August 18<sup>th</sup>
while listing the gains of the workers:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;no
compulsory redundancy, retention of the national dock labour scheme
on which the registered dockers&rsquo; protected system of employment is
based, abolition of the temporary unattached register&mdash;the dockers&rsquo;
labour pool&mdash;with men being allocated to permanent dock companies&rdquo;.
</p>
<p class="fst">
These
were the terms formerly turned down plus an &ldquo;inquiry&rdquo; conducted
by the government into the small private wharves and ports outside
the docks&rsquo; labour scheme&mdash;the &ldquo;non-scheme&rdquo; ports.
</p>
<p>
Hardly
had the dockers resumed work when Vestey&rsquo;s announced that it is to
close its cold store at Nelson&rsquo;s wharf in Lambeth which employs 87
registered dockers. It said that Jones [General Secretary of the
<em class="western">T&amp;GWU, </em><em class="western">the
transport workers&rsquo; union]</em> and
Aldington [Chair of the Port of London Authority] had been informed
of the decision weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
Thus
the grim spectre of the whittling away of the jobs of the dockers and
transferring the work to cheaper inland centres employing much lower
paid workers has not been lifted. Midland Cold Storage is owned by
the same Vestey concern, over which the struggle has been waged over
the last few months.
</p>
<p>
They
used the National Industrial Relations Court to try and stop dockers
picketing the firm. This &pound;10 million concern have announced that
they will close down Midland Cold Storage rather than employ dockers!
The reason is not at all that they object to dockers, but that they
want to employ cheap labour in order to increase their profits.
</p>
<p>
Hundreds
of millions of pounds have been lost through the dockers&rsquo; strike.
The government and the employing class prefer this loss and
dislocation rather than concede the demands of the dockers for
security of employment&mdash;wages were not the issue in this strike.
</p>
<p>
What
was noteworthy was the poisonous role of the capitalist media in
presenting a distorted picture of the struggle and the aims of the
dockers. The reptile &ldquo;popular&rdquo; capitalist press, the radio and
television all gave a false picture.
</p>
<p>
In
its editorial of August 21<sup>st</sup>
the <i>Daily Express</i> gave
the game away. The building workers are receiving the same poisonous
treatment as the dockers:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Workers
are being &lsquo;conned&rsquo; into stopping work by freelance strike
operators who claim to be acting on behalf of the official builders&rsquo;
union. There are also reports of violence and intimidation
reminiscent of the dockers&rsquo; and miners&rsquo; strikes.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Thus
the kept press gives a rehearsal of the savagery with which it will
attack the labour and trade union movement in the struggles in the
future to defend and improve living standards and the democratic
rights of the workers won in the bitter battles of the past.
</p>
<p>
The
new method of the workers of flying mobile pickets to ensure class
solidarity, first used by the miners, then the dockers and now the
building workers has reduced these spokesmen of the interests of the
employing class to virtual hysteria and apoplexy. Militants and
active workers in the movement must draw the due conclusion and
strengthen and extend such methods in the struggles of the future. <i>It
has hit the employers in a tender spot, hence these agonised cries.</i>
</p>
<p>
Class
solidarity and the support of workers in other industries and unions
is vital for every section of workers involved in strikes. No
section, however strong, can stand on its own against the employers,
the press and the state machine. That is why the unskilful
presentation of the dockers&rsquo; case by some of the London stewards
did an enormous amount of damage.
</p>
<p>
These
were members of the &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; Party and the <i>Morning
Star</i>, alleged voice of the vanguard,
published articles repeating these crude ideas without criticism.
They pictured the situation as if the dockers wished to empty out
other workers in container depots doing &ldquo;dockers&rsquo;&rdquo; work. Thus
the <i>Morning Star</i> and
the CP gave encouragement to prejudices and political backwardness
both among the dockers and other sections of the working class.
</p>
<p>
The
Liverpool shop-stewards, other than CP members, particularly the LP
chairman of the dockers&rsquo; shop-stewards committee, Jimmy Symes, came
out with the tried and tested position of &ldquo;the rate for the job&rdquo;
everyone doing container work of stuffing and stripping to receive
dockers&rsquo; pay, consequently on Merseyside there was complete harmony
between the transport workers and the dockers and the lorry drivers
gave full and unstinted support to the fight of their docker brother
trade unionists.
</p>
<p>
The
London dockers are among the best in the world at shifting cargo. In
Tilbury berth 39 they pack 42 containers an hour as against 16 in
Australia and 30 in Hamburg. But now a container ship&rsquo;s cargo is
discharged 30 times faster than that of a conventional ship. There
has been an increase in British ports from handling 25 tons of
freight to handling 600 tons per week using the same manpower. 15
container ships now carry and turn round the same amount of freight
as 85 conventional ships to Australia did formerly.
</p>
<p>
Ninety
percent of the dockers in fact are now redundant to requirements,
consequently the campaign against the dockers. The above-quoted issue
of the <i>Financial Times</i>
&ldquo;diplomatically&rdquo; stated:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Those
who regard last Wednesday&rsquo;s Transport House demonstrators as
typical of the country&rsquo;s dockers consider that as a lazy, militant,
pilfering breed, the dockers have priced themselves out of business
and have forced shippers and others to create depots away from
dockland to reap their financial return from property development
instead of employing dockers and to take their large cargoes to
European ports for trans shipment to the UK in small vessels which
can be unloaded at small ports and private wharves.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
That
is the real attitude of the employers and their lackeys to the
dockers and every other section of the working class if it comes to
that.
</p>
<p>
The
dock force is to be whittled down according to the<i>
Times</i> and the <i>Financial
Times</i> from 42,000 to 30,000 by 1975 and to
25,000 by 1980. This shows how right the shop-stewards are not to
accept the lying promises of the port employers. Apart from the old
and the sick, who are to be squeezed out by the employers&rsquo; pressure
and with &ldquo;generous&rdquo; redundancy payments gained by the organised
pressure of the strong union organisation, others will &ldquo;have to go&rdquo;
to meet the ports target.
</p>
<p>
290
jobs have been &ldquo;gained&rdquo; in depots over the next 12 months, but
already 87 jobs have been lost. 200 gained with 12,000 to go in the
next two to two and a half years.
</p>
<p>
The
dockers, through their militant shop-stewards&rsquo; committee and the
union, by solidarity and sacrifice, have made big gains in standards
of living and conditions. From among the worst-paid, they are among
the best-paid workers. From among the worst conditions, they now have
reasonable toilets, canteens and showers, at least in the big ports.
</p>
<p>
For
a few years, there was an illusory security and decent conditions.
Now all this is shattered. Technical advance is not for the benefit
of the workers, but for the greater profits of the bosses. The
&ldquo;nation&rdquo;, that is the ruling class, is to get the benefits.
People like the multi-millionaire owners of the Vestey combine. The
workers get insecurity, unemployment, worry and harder work.
</p>
<h4>Technology
lowers standards!</h4>
<p class="fst">
Invention
should be used to increase living standards and lower the hours of
work. Under capitalism, it is used for exactly the opposite purposes.
Thus the<i> Times</i> moans
in an editorial of August 17<sup>th</sup>:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;In
another respect, too, the public has reason to regret the course of
this dispute. in the terms of the
settlement&hellip;there is clear acceptance of the proposition that
registered dock workers have a prescriptive right to work done in
container groupage depots wherever they may be. But that is not all:
this right is to be enforced&mdash;or rather it is agreed that it would
be appropriate to enforce the right&mdash;by imposing financial sanctions
at the ports on anyone who does not conform&hellip;stripped of its flannel
this means a discriminatory surcharge on groupage containers coming
from or going to depots where the work is done at rates of pay lower
than those which registered dock workers have succeeded in extracting
for a different kind of work&hellip;If the phrase &lsquo;protection racket&rsquo;
was not already assigned to the underworld it would fit. It requires
no imagination to see how the generalisation of this right and its
means of enforcement would block the economic benefits of technical
change.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
This
is a naked expression of what the &ldquo;economic benefits&rdquo; mean. But
it also indicates the aim which the working class should counterpose
to it: full support to the dockers and their defence of jobs and wage
standards.
</p>
<h4>No witch
hunts</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
legitimate anger at the foolish use of violence against dockers&rsquo;
delegates outside the Transport House conference, has been blown up
by the capitalist news monopoly out of all proportion. It only took
place in two or three isolated instances against the appeals of the
shop stewards. It should not be used in the union to start a
witch-hunt as this would divide and embitter the ranks far more than
the stupid violence against the general secretary Jones and the lay
delegates.
</p>
<p>
The
resolutions of condemnation at a couple of ports are sufficient.
Militants especially should guard against such scenes. The job is to
raise the level of consciousness of the members through the
shop-stewards&rsquo; committees and within the union branches. There are
no short cuts in the struggle.
</p>
<p>
Similarly
there is always the imperative necessity to involve the solidarity of
other sections of the workers. No matter how strong and organised, no
section of workers can stand alone. If jobs are being transferred
elsewhere to undercut <i>then these workers must
be organised to gain the rate for the job</i>.
That is the only way to safeguard jobs and standards. <i>Dockers&rsquo;
rates no matter who does the job.</i>
</p>
<p>
Even
if this is gained it will not safeguard the jobs of the dockers. They
must, in common with the rest of the working class, fight for a
drastic lowering of hours, not only without loss, but with an
increase of pay. Let technical progress be for the benefit of the
class that produces the wealth not the parasites who batten on them!
If there are to be jobs lost, then there must be alternative work and
training provided without loss of pay! That is the programme to fight
for, not who is to do a diminishing number of jobs!
</p>
<h4>Political
struggle</h4>
<p class="fst">
There
is a grim outlook for the dockers&mdash;and the rest of the working
class&mdash;under capitalism. There is no escape as the experience of the
dockers indicates.
</p>
<p>
The
active dockers in recent years gained the right to be represented by
shop stewards. They must strengthen their organisation and work in
the union itself. Talk about breakaways can only be disastrous. It
will damage the organisation without putting anything of substance in
its place.
</p>
<p>
But
precisely because the struggle for jobs is a political struggle it is
necessary to link up the struggle in the unions with the struggle in
the Labour Party. Union branches must be affiliated to and
participate in the local GMCs [General Management Committees, the
constituency organisation of the labour Party]&mdash;to fight for a
socialist programme. Some members of the local branches should be
active in their wards.
</p>
<p>
They
should fight for a socialist programme for the next Labour government
on homes, jobs and standards of living. New conflicts and flare-ups
on the docks are inevitable. The &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; merely gives a
temporary respite. The socialist consciousness of the shop-stewards
and advanced militants must be carried to all the dockers and the
rest of the working class.
</p>
<p>
The
docks must be nationalised with minimum compensation to the Vesteys
and their like on the basis of need and run under workers&rsquo; control
and with the board of management two thirds appointed by the T&amp;GWU
and the TUC. Nationalisation on state capitalist lines like the
railways and the mines will not save jobs.
</p>
<p>
Reformism,
in this as in all questions, stops half way. Jones and other &ldquo;left&rdquo;
leaders undoubtedly are sincere and wish to serve the interests of
their members and the working class. But Jones himself has spoken of
the dirty role of the capitalist press and has pointed out how their
attacks on him led to an increase of membership of the union. <i>Now
they are praising him!!</i>
</p>
<h4>Transform
society</h4>
<p class="fst">
Kier
Hardie asked publicly what he had done wrong when the capitalist
press praised him. Jones and other &ldquo;left&rdquo; union leaders stand
half way between the position of accepting capitalism and the
struggle for a new social system. But it is impossible to maintain
such a position, consequently they try and compromise with the
employers and their system. This has inevitably bad consequences for
the members of their unions and for the working class. Only the
uncompromising position of Marxism can win the best results in the
day to day struggle and prepare for the complete transformation of
society which can alone bring security and abundance for the working
class.
