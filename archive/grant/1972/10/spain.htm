<p class="fst">
The Labour Party Young Socialists have undertaken a campaign of support
for the Spanish socialists, the trade unionists of the UGT (General
Union of Workers) and the Spanish Young Socialists, in their struggle
against the military-police dictatorship of Franco. They have issued
an excellent broadsheet which we can recommend to all workers.
</p>
<p>
In
this they demonstrate their internationalism, their socialism and
their understanding that the struggles of the workers of all
countries against their capitalist masters are indissolubly tied
together to the struggles of the British workers.
</p>
<p>
It
is significant that they are the only tendency in the labour movement
to launch such a campaign&mdash;of material solidarity by campaigning for
funds, and, as important, a demonstration to the Spanish socialists
and the working class that they do not stand alone in their heroic
struggle against the dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
It
is of great significance that not a single &ldquo;communist&rdquo; party
internationally has organised a similar campaign. Neither the
powerful &ldquo;communist&rdquo; parties of France or Italy nor the smaller
ones of Western Europe have lifted a finger in mass activity on this
question.
</p>
<h4>Franco</h4>
<p class="fst">
A
few articles in the press of sympathy to their brother parties
constitute only platonic gestures This is because of the nationalist
orientation of the leadership of these parties, who look at events
from a narrow nationalist point of view, although they talk sometimes
spuriously of &ldquo;internationalism&rdquo;. Internationalism is of the deed
and not of a few pious words!
</p>
<p>
Yet
Spain today is the key to the international situation as Germany was
in the 1930s. A victory of the Spanish workers in the coming
revolution would be of as great significance to the workers of Europe
and the world in the 1970s as that of the Russian revolution was
after 1917.
</p>
<p>
But
the myopia of nationalism and reformism afflict the leadership of the
CP and they are incapable of rousing the workers internationally to
give material, social and theoretical support to the struggle of the
Spanish workers, which is in its early stages.
</p>
<p>
Conditions
in Spain are reaching revolutionary maturity. Lenin defined 4
conditions for revolution, these are developing in Spain:
</p>
<p>
1)
The ruling class of capitalists and landlords are in an impasse.
Economically and politically they are worse off than the capitalists
of the &ldquo;democracies&rdquo;. Spain is weak in industrial competitive
capacity, and the very development of industry during the last 25
years makes her dependent on industry.
</p>
<p>
Agriculture,
already facing a crisis, faces the prospect of tariffs by Britain,
when she enters the European Economic Community.
</p>
<p>
The
ruling class understands that the country cannot continue in the
strait-jacket of the corrupt dictatorship of Franco. They know of the
discontent of the overwhelming majority of the population. They fear
the future as the capitalists of Russia dreaded it. Like the Russian
regime of absolutism the country is finding the ignorant and
merciless dictatorship unbearable.
</p>
<p>
They
have access to the reports of Franco&rsquo;s secret police and they
realise that the regime cannot be maintained indefinitely. <i>But
this has provoked a split in their ranks </i>as
some sections have demanded a return to completely unbridled terror
as the only way to maintain capitalism while others are in favour of
concessions to try and pacify the workers. That is the first
condition of revolution, a split among the ruling class.
</p>
<p>
2)
The middle class must be vacillating between the rulers and the
workers, as the second condition. But the Spanish middle class is not
vacillating. <i>It is overwhelmingly
against Franco</i>. The mass of the
students, who are mainly the sons and daughters of the capitalists,
landlords and the middle class are against Franco.
</p>
<p>
Lawyers,
doctors and professional people feel the burden of the dictatorship
and want a change of the system. The shopkeepers and small
businessmen find all the exactions and tyranny of the dictatorship,
the lording over them of the hated bureaucratic officials as a heavy
burden. They are disgusted by the favouring of big business and the
monopolies at their expense.
</p>
<p>
In
Vigo and other cities when the workers struck the small shopkeepers
closed their shops in sympathy. The small businessmen look with
favour on the struggle of the workers as perhaps a means of lifting
the iron vise
of the dictatorship from which they cannot get any redress of its
abuses.
</p>
<p>
3)
The workers of Spain have already shown themselves as worthy
successors to their magnificent fathers and grandfathers in their
heroism in the Spanish revolution of 1931 to 1937.
</p>
<p>
Under
the greatest repression and difficulties they have launched the
biggest strike wave in Europe, next to that of the Italian workers,
in proportion to population, despite the fact that strikes are
illegal and the leaders face torture and imprisonment. In practically
every area of Spain there have been strikes for higher wages, better
conditions and more rights for the workers.
</p>
<h4>Fascism</h4>
<p class="fst">
Sympathy
strikes, doubly illegal, have taken place in many areas. Openly
political strikes in the Basque country against the death sentences
passed on &ldquo;terrorists&rdquo; took place in 1970.
</p>
<p>
Fascism
or a military police state can only hold power when the workers are
disorganised and atomised and their political and trade union
organisations are utterly crashed. Now the workers are heroically and
painfully reconstructing these organisations in the teeth of
repression and police agents. The working class has recovered from
the terrible defeat of the civil war of 1936-39.
</p>
<p>
The
illegal strikes and demonstrations and barricade fighting show the
capacity of struggle of the Spanish workers. That is the third
condition for the socialist revolution.
</p>
<p>
4)
But history over and over again in Britain, France, Germany, Italy
and of course Spain, show that that is not sufficient for the
socialist revolution.
</p>
<p>
If
they are to be successful, the Spanish socialists must study the
lessons of the defeated revolution of 1931-1937. This period is
replete with the lesson that it is impossible to trust the
capitalists and their Liberal political representatives. The
Republican-Socialist Coalition of 1931-33 prepared the way for the
reaction of the church, the monarchists the right republicans and the
clerical fascism of Gil Robles.
</p>
<p>
Against
the resistance of the workers, it was impossible to establish fascism
in a &ldquo;cold&rdquo; way. The capitalists pushed power to the &ldquo;Popular
Front&rdquo; while preparing seriously to crush the workers. What is the
&ldquo;Popular Front&rdquo;? According to the Communist Party who invented
this &ldquo;theory&rdquo; it is an alliance of the &ldquo;democratic
capitalists&rdquo;, the middle class and the working class against
fascism.
</p>
<h4>Popular Front: &ldquo;a strike breaking
conspiracy&rdquo;&mdash;Leon Trotsky</h4>
<p class="fst">
Trotsky
called it a &ldquo;strike-breaking conspiracy&rdquo;. In February 1936 the
Popular Front was victorious in the elections. The Liberals of Aza&ntilde;a
and company took power. The workers did not trust them because of
their experience of 1931-36 and themselves carried through the
programme put forward by the Popular Front in 24 hours! They did this
through direct action in the factories. They forced the employers to
concede higher wages, holidays with pay, the 8 hour day and other
demands.
</p>
<p>
They
stormed the jails and tore down the walls, releasing the tens of
thousands of political prisoners put in jail after the defeat of the
general strike and the Asturian insurrection of 1934, against the
protests of the Liberals who said they should wait until Parliament
met. They carried through measures not in the Popular Front
programme. Tens if not hundreds of thousands of workers had been
victimised and lost their lobs. Fascists had been taken on in their
place. The workers re-instated their victimised comrades and mates
and forced the employers to pay them two years back pay! They
expelled the fascists, who took their jobs, from the factories.
</p>
<p>
The
Liberal government helped the capitalists to prepare their revenge.
Increases in prices and inflation rapidly cancelled out most of the
gains of the workers. Consequently the working class felt themselves
betrayed. The middle class and small business people were being
revived.
</p>
<p>
The
workers saw their gains being rapidly whittled away. As a result
there was a general strike in Span in every city and even the smaller
towns.
</p>
<p>
The
ruling class found this intolerable and behind the scenes reaction
prepared to strike against the working class. The pages of the
workers&rsquo; press, including that of the &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; Party
appeared with empty white spaces because the Liberal censor mould not
allow them to print warnings against the preparation of an army coup.
</p>
<p>
The
Liberals&mdash;the &ldquo;Popular Front&rdquo; government did nothing against the
armed forces, conspirators in the army, navy and air force. The
officers and generals prepared to strike almost without hindrance.
The government played musical chairs and transferred the generals
conspirators round the country.
</p>
<p>
Franco
was sent from Madrid to the Canary Islands garrison the conspirators
were shuffled round and the conspiracy proceeded merrily on.
</p>
<p>
Marxists
would explain this &ldquo;pacifist&rdquo; forbearance very simply. It lies in
the class nature of the state. Had these been rank and file privates
plotting socialist revolution they would have been court-martialed
and shot for treason. But how could the &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; capitalist
government take action for treason against the generals and officers?
The &ldquo;state&rdquo; leaned on these as a protection for the capitalists
against the working class. To take action would have meant
undermining the capitalist state itself.
</p>
<h4>Civil war</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
fascist conspiracy thus went on under the cloak of the Popular Front
government. When generals Franco and Sanjurjo organised the fascist
revolt in July of 1936, in Morocco the Popular Front government tried
to hide the news from the Spanish people. They then offered, in
secret negotiations, the posts of Minister of the Interior and
Minister of War in the government to Franco&rsquo;s conspirators! That
would have meant a &ldquo;cold&rdquo; switch to fascism. Those were the posts
that Mussolini and Hitler insisted on in the first &ldquo;coalition&rdquo;
governments of fascism in Italy and Germany.
</p>
<p>
But
the news leaked through to the workers of Spain through the sailors
who seized the Spanish warships and radioed the news to the workers
of Spain.
</p>
<p>
In
future articles we will trace the course of the Civil War. Here it is
only necessary to point out that the workers reacted to this news by
mass demonstrations. Beginning with the immortal workers of
Barcelona, they marched against the army barracks. Even according to
the capitalist press armed with a few shotguns, knives and even table
legs, they smashed the army by appealing to the soldiers to come over
to the workers. The workers of Madrid, Valencia and other cities
followed the lead of Barcelona. In five-sixths of Spain the workers
were victorious.
</p>
<h4>The state</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
state, says Lenin, in <i>The State and
Revolution</i> can be reduced to &ldquo;bodies
of armed men&rdquo;. The police and army, navy and air force apparatus
had been swept away in Spain. There was only one armed force&mdash;the
workers&rsquo; militias! There was nothing in the way of the workers
taking power. The workers had the power!
</p>
<p>
They
seized the factories and in Catalonia and Aragon, the peasants seized
the land and collectivised it! The Popular Front government was
suspended in mid-air. They had neither police nor army owing them
allegiance. It was a far more favourable situation for the socialist
revolution than in Russia after the revolution of February 1917.
</p>
<p>
The
leaders of all the workers parties frustrated this initiative of the
workers, pushed the power back to the &ldquo;Popular Front&rdquo; i.e.
capitalist government and thus they prepared the betrayal of the
workers and the defeat of the revolution and thus the victory of
Franco. (This also will be dealt with in future issues as Spain, past
and future, is of vital importance to, not only the Spanish, but the
international working class).
</p>
<p>
In Chile, at the moment, as we predicted, the policies of coalition with
the Liberal and democratic capitalists by the CP and SP is pushing
the middle class into the arms of reaction. Thus the unprecedented
strike of the small business owners of lorries and buses, of small
businessmen and shopkeepers. This is the consequence of partial
measures of nationalisation, which has resulted in 3o to 50 percent
inflation and the discontent of the middle class, which is being
pushed into the arms of reaction by the sabotage of the capitalist
parties of big business. Thus the mirage of an alliance with the
&ldquo;democratic&rdquo; capitalists and the middle class is shown to be an
alliance with the &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; political exploiters of the middle
class which can only repel them and push them into antagonism against
the working class which reaction exploits.
</p>
<p>
It is just at this time that the Spanish &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; Party has
published again their policy for Spain, according to the <i>Morning
Star</i> of October 17<sup>th</sup>:
<i>Mundo Obrero</i>
publishes the following details, which are quoted <i>verbatim</i>
from the translation in that paper:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;The political revolution which Spain requires&rdquo; says
the resolution, &ldquo;has no need to be a civil war or an insurrection
of classic type.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;With a relation of forces favourable to political
change, isolating the ultra-right, this political revolution will
require less violence than that habitually used by the Franco regime
to maintain itself in power.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;The political revolution will be
a democratic and national change in which the largest possible number
of forces desirous of political liberty should take part.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Who
these anonymous &ldquo;forces&rdquo; are is shown in a succeeding paragraph
it calls for &ldquo;an end to repression and vote and voice for Spaniards
giving <i>each social class</i>
and each party the opportunity to act democratically&rdquo; (our
emphasis)
</p>
<p>
What
has this in common with Lenin&rsquo;s policy in Russia? It is an
<i>all-class</i>
i.e. capitalist policy not one based on the class struggle. This
policy of non-class coalitionism or popular frontism prepared defeats
in the past. It is now intended to save the capitalists in their hour
of danger.
</p>
<p>
The
capitalists supported Franco and if some of them are seeking other
means of rule it is only because they see the danger of the overthrow
of the regime leading to the overthrow of capitalism as well.
</p>
<p>
The
national or democratic revolution to which they refer in Spain cannot
be carried out under capitalism. The capitalist or
bourgeois-democratic revolution is now impossible of achievement by
the capitalist class. The history of China, Russia and Spain
demonstrates this irrefutably.
</p>
<p>
Lenin,
analysing the conditions in Russia very similar to those in Spain, of
capitalist-landlord absolutism, instead of conciliation declared
irreconcilable struggle against the Liberal capitalists. We could
give thousands of quotations from the articles of Lenin. But taking a
couple at
random in Volume 11, page 53 in
the <i>Collected Works</i>
in English; Lenin says:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;The fundamental mistake of the opportunist Social
Democrats lies in their failure to understand what the decisive
victory of the bourgeois revolution means. Our Russian opportunists
who, like all opportunists belittle the theory of revolutionary
Marxism and the role of the proletariat as the vanguard, constantly
labour under the illusion that the liberal bourgeoisie must
inevitably be &lsquo;the boss&rsquo; in the bourgeois revolution.&rdquo;
</p>
<h4>Lenin</h4>
<p class="fst">
Again,
on page 54:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;The
Bolshevik draft resolution for the congress clearly stated that the
liberal bourgeoisie is trying to make a deal with the old regime, is
wavering between revolution and reaction [like the Spanish&mdash;EG] is
afraid of the people, and afraid of the free and all-sided
development of their activities; <i>and
all that is not due to chance, but to its fundamental interests</i>.&rdquo;
(Our emphasis)
</p>
<p class="fst">
Again
on page 70: 
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;What
is the main flaw in all these opportunist arguments? It is that <i>in
fact</i> they substitute the bourgeois
theory of &lsquo;united&rsquo; social progress for the socialist theory of
the class struggle as the only real driving force of history.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
The
&ldquo;Communist&rdquo; Party of Spain appeals to &ldquo;<i>all
social classes</i>&rdquo;. Lenin replies that
the proletariat in its struggle against absolutism must wage an
implacable struggle against the capitalist class.
</p>
<h4>&ldquo;Communist&rdquo; Party</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
Spanish capitalists will only agree to democratic reforms when the
Franco regime is threatened with overthrow by the working class when
in order to prevent the socialist revolution they will try to save
their system as in Russia of February 1917 by temporarily accepting
democracy while they prepare the way for a new Franco.
</p>
<p>
Spain
is now more developed industrially than Russia was before the
revolution. Industrial production per head of population is higher
than it was in the latter. Even in absolute terms Spanish production
is higher. In 1914 the highest figure for Tsarism, Russia produced 4
million tons of steel. Spain produces more than 7 million, nearly
double. In Russia the industrial working class was one tenth of the
population in Spain it is nearly half.
</p>
<p>
The
absolutist military-police state of Tsarism was very like the
military-police state of Franco. Now, Spain like Russia is
approaching revolution. The conditions for revolution are even more
favourable in Spain than they were in Russia. The only difference&mdash;a
mighty difference&mdash;is in the strategy and tactics of the leadership
of the working class. The policy of the Spanish &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; Party
leaders <i>is worse than that of the
Mensheviks whom Lenin fought in Russia</i>.
</p>
<p>
If
their policy succeeds, the Spanish revolution will suffer an even
bigger disaster than in 1931-37.
</p>
<h4>Russia 1917</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
leaders of the Spanish CP have never analysed or explained the
reasons for the defeat of the last Spanish revolution. Lenin
meticulously analysed on the basis of the works of Marx and Engels
the experience of the defeated Paris Commune and the Russian
Revolution of 1905. That is how he prepared the advanced workers for
the victorious revolution of October 1917.
</p>
<p>
Yet
the Spanish CP has published no works analysing the strategy and
tactics of the workers&rsquo; parties that guaranteed defeat in an
exceptionally favourable situation in 1931-1937. Those who fail to
learn from their mistakes are doomed to repeat them. The only
difference in the policy of the CP leaders is that their present
policy is even worse than the strategy and tactics of support for the
&ldquo;liberal capitalists&rdquo; at a time when the latter are powerless and
looking for a way to stultify the inexorable movement of the workers
to overthrow the Franco dictatorship.
</p>
<p>
The
social set-up in Spain is very similar to that of Russia before 1917,
a capitalist-landlord regime leaning on absolutism. The complete
rottenness of the Liberal capitalists in both, has been demonstrated
historically. The proletariat must conduct a ruthless struggle
against the capitalists who fostered, nurtured supported and gave the
power to Franco.
</p>
<p>
Despite
phrases about &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; the CP statement talks about being in
favour of &ldquo;association&rdquo; with the Common Market once Franco is
removed. That shows that in reality they look to a purely capitalist
&ldquo;democratic&rdquo; development (by the way, the British CP leaders, who
have waged a nationalist campaign against British entry publish this
without comment! That&rsquo;s the Spanish CP&rsquo;s business, nothing to do
with us Britishers!)
</p>
<h4>Proletariat</h4>
<p class="fst">
Thus,
as in 1931-1937 the CP is preparing to play a reactionary role which
could lead the Spanish people to a catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
The
fate of the coming revolution in Spain now rests on the shoulders of
the Spanish Socialist Party. The Spanish Young Socialists and the UGT
(the Spanish trade unionists), above all on their leading and active
elements. They have got rid of the right-wing leadership. Now what is
needed is Marxist policies. With the ideas of Lenin and Trotsky as
their guide they could rapidly assume leadership of the working
class.
</p>
<p>
They
could win over most of the rank and file of the CP. While fighting
for every democratic right, free speech, the right to vote the right
to organise, the right to strike, these must be seen as transitional
demands that can only be guaranteed by the dictatorship of the
proletariat&mdash;workers&rsquo; democracy.
