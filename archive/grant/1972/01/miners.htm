280,000
miners have accepted the challenge of the National Coal Board and the
government who wish to keep them tied down to degrading wages. The
increase offered of 7.9 percent does not even compensate for the rise
in the cost of living of 14 percent. Since 1965 there has been a fall
in real wages in comparison with rising costs. From being top in
wage-rates, miners have fallen to the lower levels of workers. That
is the reason for the first national miners&rsquo; strike since 1926.
</p>
<p>
The
case of the miners is unanswerable. For dirty, dangerous and hard
work, they demand a modest standard of living. Even if the full
demands of the miners were conceded, it would not compensate for the
dark, dreary conditions most of them have to work in. The underground
workers do not see daylight till the weekend, and not always then.
</p>
<p>
The
brutal attitude of the well-paid officials of the Coal Board has been
dictated by the Tory government. Cold-bloodedly they wish to make the
miners the target of their policies, just as last year it was the
Post Office workers. The strike is the full responsibility of the
Conservative government. It is their so-called &ldquo;wages policy&rdquo; of
a &ldquo;norm&rdquo; of 8 percent which is behind the refusal of the Board to
concede more than &pound;2 and &pound;1.90 for certain classes of miners.
</p>
<p>
It
is not public enterprise they are defending, but the interests of the
monopolies. If government enterprise gives way, then private big
business would also have to concede reasonable wage increases which
would at least be related in some measure to the increase in the cost
of living. Hence their piggish stubbornness.
</p>
<p>
Even <i>The Times</i>,
organ of big business, in its issue of January 10<sup>th</sup>,
was compelled to admit in an editorial: &ldquo;private owners would
capitulate.&rdquo; The government does not care if it costs tens of
millions of pounds to the economy, as it undoubtedly will, if they
can save the pockets of their millionaire backers. So much for their
concern for the &ldquo;nation and for the economy.&rdquo; In crises of this
sort, it is revealed that they stand for the naked interests of
capital.
</p>
<p>
That is why every worker, every trade unionist and every Labour Party
member must stand fully behind the miners. <i>Their
fight is our fight</i>. It is the fight of the entire working class. These cold, callous,
hard-faced men, these desperate capitalists, are defending their
rotten system. No matter if the workers eke out a living, so long as
their profits are kept up; that is their main concern. Carr, Barber,
Davies and Heath are merely tools in their hands.
</p>
<h4>Sixty-four percent capacity</h4>
<p class="fst">
If
the argument is that the NCB could not &ldquo;afford more&rdquo; as Ezra, the
head of the Coal Board, maintains, that is entirely false. In a few
weeks of the strike, the Coal Board will lose more than if they had
conceded the entire claim of &pound;9. If the economy were fully planned
and organised, it would be possible to give the miners much more, and
lower hours as well.
</p>
<p>
Thousands
of millions of pounds are being lost because the economy is working
at only 64 percent of capacity. If the million unemployed were
working productively it could mean an extra &pound;6 a week for every
family this year. The economy working at full pitch could easily give
the miners their full and just demand.
</p>
<p>
Instead,
the government and the Coal Board calculate that if they can club
down the miners and beat them to the ground, no matter the cost to
the miners, their families and the coal industry, that would serve as
a lesson to other sections of workers demanding higher wages. State
industry can suffer losses if private industry thereby is safeguarded
against the claims of their workers. That is the cynicism of the
government and the Coal Board.
</p>
<h4>Scandalous
pay</h4>
<p class="fst">
Even
the hireling capitalist press has a difficult case to make against
the miners. They admit that the take-home pay of many sections of the
miners is a scandalous &pound;11 to &pound;14. <i>The
Express</i>
reports an interview with Tony Darnley, a miner at Goldthorpe
colliery in Yorkshire:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Tony Darley is
27, with a wife, a son and a daughter&hellip;For 38 weeks so far, he has
been paid a total of &pound;647 before deductions. [That means &pound;17 a week
approximately&mdash;after deductions it would be &pound;11 or &pound;12.] During
Christmas week he drew &pound;12.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Said
Tony Darley: &lsquo;I am over my head in debt and I can&rsquo;t afford to go
on strike&mdash;but honestly there is no other way. Miners have been
underpaid for years and everybody knows it&rsquo;.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo; &lsquo;The
visits the Board bosses make to various pits make me laugh&rsquo;.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll admit
they get their faces and hands dirty but do they actually see us at
work? Get a few of them up the Seventies [the seam where he operates]
and they would soon change their tune&rsquo;.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo; &lsquo;Do you know what I wear at work? A pair of wellies, without stockings, a
helmet, a belt and swimming trunks. It&rsquo;s the water that sprays in
like a fountain&rsquo;.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo; &lsquo;Holidays?
I don&rsquo;t know what they are. They are just something everyone else
talks about&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>
<h4>Good Samaritan?</h4>
<p class="fst">
That
is why the miners are on strike and that is why they must get
unstinted and maximum support. The attitude taken by the TUC in this
connection is that of the man who passed by the sick man and not that
of the good Samaritan. They owe a debt to the miners as does every
section of the labour and trade union movement, in the past and not
least now, when the miners have not been prepared meekly to accept
the dictates of the government and the Coal Board.
</p>
<p>
The
TUC has left it to the individual unions to give support instead of
organising a full-scale campaign and mobilising the entire working
class. A campaign of this sort would very rapidly bring the
government to see reason, and get the Coal Board to give in to the
claim of the miners. Joe Gormley, president of the miners&rsquo; union
made the understatement of the year when he commented on January
10<sup>th</sup>:
&ldquo;I know we have been in touch with individual unions but I would
have thought that this was one time that the TUC could have shown
itself to be united.&rdquo;
</p>
<h4>Class
solidarity</h4>
<p class="fst">
The
rank and file of the Labour Party and the unions must send
resolutions of support, financial assistance to the miners and
demands for the NEC and the TUC to campaign for funds and organise
meetings in favour of the miners. The national committee of the
Labour Party Young Socialists have already done so.
</p>
<p>
The
T&amp;GWU, the NUR, ASLEF and other unions have already pledged
support and promised that there will be no blacklegging. The dockers&rsquo;
shop stewards, meeting nationally, have pledged support. The
railwaymen have already moved into action. Fred Hoyle, publicity
officer of the NUR in Manchester has already stated: &ldquo;We will not
move coal into sidings or out, and if anyone has ideas of changing to
oil to beat this, we will ban the handling of that as well.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Railwaymen
have taken solidarity action at Dunfermline in Scotland, refusing to
move coal to a power station. At Eastleigh, Hants., members of ASLEF
have refused to carry imported coal to power stations. At Port Talbot
in South Wales, ASLEF men have passed a resolution declaring they
will not drive trains into any colliery, open cast working sites or
docks to move coal. That is the spirit of class solidarity that must
become the spirit of the whole organised labour movement.
</p>
<p>
The
anger of the miners at the stiff-necked attitude of the Coal Board,
the ventriloquist&rsquo;s dummy for the government, was shown when Ezra
announced the withdrawal of even his meagre wage offer. Behind the
scenes, preparations had been made even before this crisis for 32
more pits to be closed. Lawrence Daly said: &ldquo;I regard the extension
of the refusal to do safety work in some areas as an indication of
the deep anger felt by the miners at the provocative act of the Coal
Board in withdrawing the wages offer already made.&rdquo;
</p>
<h4>Extreme bitterness</h4>
<p class="fst">
At
Goldthorpe colliery, already mentioned, a mass meeting of miners
turned down the request of the colliery manager to send down
volunteers to fight a pit fire. The under-managers, the deputies and
the manager himself had to go underground to fight the fire. This is
a sign of the extreme bitterness of the combine.
</p>
<p>
The
compassion of the miners is indicated by the provision which has been
made to supply old-age pensioners, hospitals and other weak and
helpless and in dire need.
</p>
<p>
Now
that the fight is on, the miners must not accept a rotten compromise.
They must fight for the full claim. With the aid and assistance of
the whole of the working class they can win it. Any negotiated
settlement must be put to meetings of the delegates or to miners&rsquo;
meetings before it is accepted.
</p>
<p>
Complete solidarity!
</p>
<p>
For miner&rsquo;s victory!
</p>
<p>
For the full &pound;9!
