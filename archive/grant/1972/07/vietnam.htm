The Vietnam War is the most barbarous in the bloodstained story of
imperialism. The strongest military and economic power in the history of the
world, America,
has been waging war against a small, largely peasant people, for more than 12
years.
</p>
<p>
In the ferocious desire to gain victory
they have escalated every aspect of the war in turn. At one time there were
nearly 600,000 American and allied troops in Vietnam. They have killed over 2
million Vietnamese, nearly 1 in 17 of the population of S. Vietnam and N. Vietnam together.
</p>
<p>
The United States has been spending
over &#163;9,000 million a year on the Vietnam War alone, more than three times the
entire military budget of British capitalism. They have used the most
diabolical weapons in the history of war. Even if one includes the nuclear
bombs used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
</p>
<p>
The saturation bombing of North Vietnam
amounts to the same tonnage as used in the atomic bombs. In total the
explosives dropped on Vietnam North and South amount to 1,000 Hiroshimas.
</p>
<p>
More bombs have been dropped on a country
not much bigger than Great
Britain than were dropped on all the
belligerents taken together in the Second World War.
</p>
<h4>Command of air</h4>
<p>
Since the spring of 1971, &#34;Noxious&#34;
herbicides have been banned. &#34;Only&#34; herbicides used in the United States
have been permitted! Such is the &#34;generosity&#34; of the American President's
instructions, after protests from all over the world.
</p>
<p>
Despite these horrific tools of war and the
arming of the South Vietnamese with the most modern weapons they have been
unable to stand against the forces of the National Liberation Front in the
South and the North Vietnamese soldiers. Only the command of the air and the
most ferocious bombing of troops and civilians alike, North and South, have
saved the puppet regime of Thieu from complete collapse in the recent
offensive.
</p>
<p>
&#160;On paper, the South Vietnamese possess an
army of 481,000 regulars and 705,000 paramilitary forces. The N.L.F. is
estimated at 140,000 and the North Vietnamese troops including those used in
the fighting taking place now at not more than 200,000!
</p>
<h4>&#160;&#34;Stone age&#34;</h4>
<p>
&#160;In numbers, the South Vietnamese forces are
overwhelmingly superior. But the troops have no morale. They have no interest
in fighting for the corrupt Landlord-Capitalist regime.
</p>
<p>
It is unprecedented in modern war for a
numerically inferior force to gain such successes as the capture of Quang Tri
and even the stalemate at An Loc and Kontum, without air cover and against
bigger contingents of troops, backed by the devastating and malevolent use of
air power.
</p>
<p>
&#160;The reason for the fleeing of practically
the entire civilian population from the besieged cities is not fear of the
Vietcong but fear of the reprisal bombing of the American air forces, which has
reduced whole cities to rubble.
</p>
<p>
&#160;Even Marshal
Ky, the admirer of Hitler, when he tried to
put forward a candidature in the abortive presidential &#34;election&#34; last year
pointed out that South
Vietnam was a &#34;society fraught with
unprecedented injustice and corruption while the soldiers, the civil servants
and the underprivileged citizens are condemned to a life of destitution.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#160;These demagogic words fell on deaf ears.
President Thieu organised a one candidate &#34;election&#34; with the backing of the
generals, landlords and capitalists.
</p>
<p>
&#160;Without American backing his regime would
not last a week. In the rural areas in this plebiscitary farce he received
99.7% of the vote for an already decided election! Like the votes of Hitler,
obtained by terror and fear it was meaningless. As soon as the N.L.F. forces
arrive, the peasants rise against their landlord oppressors and welcome the
forces of liberation.
</p>
<p>
It is clear that the &#34;pacification&#34; of the
rural areas, such as the Mekong Delta has collapsed. Occupying American troops
and the terror and torture by the forces of Thieu, carefully weeding out and
screening all the forces of resistance, partially succeeded over years of
repression in cowing and holding down the peasants. This has disappeared in the
last few months. That can be the only justification for the North Vietnamese
offensive, in face of American air superiority.
</p>
<p>
But the American imperialists are
desperately trying to force a compromise by their brutal bombing of the North.
One of their generals declared that they would <em>&#34;bomb North Vietnam
into the stone age&#34;</em>. They are systematically trying to destroy all economic
life. They have been tampering with the weather and trying to flood certain
areas and according to the North Vietnamese government are bombing the dykes
which could lead to large scale flooding and the loss of millions of lives if
they destroy the dyke system.
</p>
<p>
This was one of the war crimes in Holland for which the
Nazis were charged in Nuremburg after the Second World War.
</p>
<p>
Nixon, the representative of American imperialism
has been compelled to withdraw nearly all American ground combat troops because
of the opposition of the troops themselves. In 1970 there were officially
listed 271 &#34;Fragmentation cases&#34;, hand grenades thrown at officers while
sleeping in their bunks.
</p>
<p>
The American army, according to one
American general, is the most demoralised in history. The soldiers feel they
are fighting a dirty, unjust, colonial war. They can see the hostility of the
Vietnamese people. The war was a nightmare of insecurity against the implacable
peasant guerrilla war. America
has sustained over 50,000 dead and hundreds of thousands of wounded. The war
has been interminable. If it was not for the rapid replacement of conscript
troops after a relatively short period of service in Vietnam, practically the entire
infantry troops would have mutinied long ago.
</p>
<p>
This was the most demoralised army in
history. Had there been a strong socialist movement in America, the
American capitalists would be facing the socialist revolution under these
conditions.
</p>
<p>
That is why the American imperialists have
been reluctantly forced to withdraw their ground combat troops. The experiment
of building up a puppet army of Vietnamese, with the backing of the air force
and navy, has to bring victory. Without ground troops they cannot possibly win.
Even with ground troops they could not defeat the guerrilla war against the
army of occupation.
</p>
<p>
Now they cannot use ground troops because
of the inevitable storm of opposition of the American people, weary of the war
and of the possible refusal to embark for Vietnam by the conscripts. While
the Vietnam War lasts they cannot get a volunteer army.
</p>
<p>
&#160;For the first time in 200 years, America faces
defeat. Thieu declared in October 1970 that in the event of a cease-fire they
would lose control of 20 out of 44 provinces. Now the situation is far worse.
The British Labour movement must demand the unconditional withdrawal of all
American troops and not only the 69,000 ground troops which remain but the air
force and navy as well.
</p>
<p>
&#160;Despite the sacrifices and the terrible
toll of lives and destruction of the economy, American capitalism has faced
disaster because they were fighting against the forces of national and social
liberation from the shackles of foreign occupation and oppression and
landlordism and capitalism. That is why they will be defeated.
</p>
<p>
&#160;That is why against terrible odds the North
Vietnamese and South Vietnamese N.L.F. soldiers fight so bravely and
heroically. Without American troops the regime of the, <em>in reality</em>, dictator Thieu, like that of the dictator Diem would
have collapsed long ago. Even with the aid of the American navy and air force,
the rotten system will not be able to maintain itself for long.
</p>
<p>
&#160;The victory of the N.L.F. will be an
enormously progressive one in the sense of eliminating foreign imperialist
intervention and destroying landlordism and capitalism. But for the Vietnamese
and world working class it will be simultaneously a victory and a defeat.
</p>
<p>
A victory against the forces of world
capitalism. A defeat, in the sense that instead of workers' democracy, as in
the days of Lenin and Trotsky, a totalitarian dictatorship like that of China and Russia will be imposed on the
Vietnamese people.
</p>
<p>
&#160;This will necessitate a new political
revolution in the future when the Vietnamese people will join the peoples of
Asia and Europe organised in a Socialist and
democratic federation of the peoples with workers' management of industry and
the state.
