<p class="fst">
The dockers are out. They have magnificently carried out the trade union
injunction &ldquo;An injury to one is an
injury to all&rdquo;. The arrest of five dockers under the Industrial
Relations Act has been the last straw. All are out in London,
Liverpool, Cardiff, Glasgow, Bristol, Felixstowe, Leith, Chatham,
Great Yarmouth, Middlesbrough, Ipswich, Barry and even King&rsquo;s Lynn.
In Manchester, dockers&rsquo; foremen, clerical staff, delivery clerks,
tally clerks, grain workers, crane drivers have joined in&mdash;every
section of the dock workers is absolutely solid. This applies to all
the ports.
</p>
<p>
Not only the
dockers, but their fellow trade unionists, are replying to the
provocation of the government, employers and their courts and acting
in solidarity with the dockers.
</p>
<p>
Lorry
drivers in London announced immediate solidarity with the dockers and
many have already come out on strike. According to reports on the
radio, Midlands Cold Storage workers at the depot picketed by the
dockers have announced their intention to come out on strike in
sympathy with the jailed dockers.
</p>
<p>
Local authority workers up and
down the country are discussing strike action&mdash;Bexley will be out on
the 25<sup>th</sup>. Brighton
council workers are sending a delegation to support the dockers&rsquo;
march.
</p>
<p>
The Thames lightermen and bargemen are on strike anyway, so no refuse
will be moved down the river.
</p>
<p>
Threats
of all-out action have been made by leaders of London Transport
workers and the Transport and General Workers&rsquo; Union.
</p>
<p>
<i>All
London buses and tubes and all road haulage could be at a stand-still
in 24 hours. </i>50,000 Heathrow airport workers
will be holding a 24 hour strike from 4 o&rsquo;clock on Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
The
Fleet Street printers are out. Reports are coming in that the
provincial printers  are following the lead of their brothers in
London. The <i>Manchester Evening News</i> and the <i>Liverpool Echo</i> 
are already on strike.
</p>
<p>
8,000 miners
in Wales, Yorkshire and Scotland have spontaneously struck while
their area bodies are discussing the situation. It will not be long
before they will be followed by all the miners in these areas and
throughout the country. British Leyland and Fords workers have
already promised their support and would be out if they were not on
holiday.
</p>
<p>
But
the tool-room at Longbridge, which was working is now closed by
strike action. 2,000 workers at Shell Chemicals at Carrington,
Lancashire have downed tools. The Fisher-Bendix workers have rallied
behind their docker brothers.
</p>
<p>
The
Fish porters at Hull and Grimsby have joined the dockers. The porters
at Smithfield and Covent Garden are out.
</p>
<p>
<i>Already
trade union principles have shown that
they are not bounded by national
barriers or the sea. The French dockers are blacking all goods to or
from Britain.</i>
</p>
<p>
The
Industrial Relations Act was intended as a reserve weapon in the
hands of the ruling class&mdash;as Heath and Co. said, &ldquo;as a court of
last resort&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
The
purpose of the Act has been stymied by small employers using it
without concern for the interests of big business or the state.
Consequently, the Act has boomeranged and exploded in the face of its
authors.
</p>
<p>
As
<i>The Times</i>, the voice
of big business, sarcastically observes, in working out who is to
replace the disaster, Heath, as the next Conservative prime minister:
&ldquo;Mr. Carr is confined by his authorship of the IR Act. As the
process of his law, like a disordered slot machine, produces a
succession of unforeseen results, mostly raspberry flavoured, Mr.
Carr remains tied to it.&rdquo;
</p>
<h4>Century of struggle</h4>
<p class="fst">
This
shows the complete falsity of the argument that the government cannot
intervene in the process of the law&mdash;a law for which they are
responsible&mdash;and release the dockers.
</p>
<p>
<i>If they were to carry out
the law, they would have to arrest every worker on strike, for
contempt of court.</i>
</p>
<p>
Carr
and Macmillan have declaimed about &ldquo;the law of the jungle&rdquo; and
&ldquo;force&rdquo; being used by the dockers. As if the capitalist system
and its laws are not based on the law of the jungle and force,
against the working people and their capitalist rivals abroad! As if
the only defence of the workers against the jungle law of the
employers and their government were not the strength of their
organisation!
</p>
<p>
The rights of the working class were not given by benign Tory
governments. They were only gained in a century of struggle against
unjust laws. The right to strike, the right to vote, the right to
organise, the right of free speech, were only won by the struggle of
the working people. To maintain these rights depends on the vigilance
of the working class and the strength of their organisations.
</p>
<p>
Anatole France, the French writer and socialist, gave a crushing reply to the
Tories of his day on this question of &ldquo;the law&rdquo;. Ironically he
declaimed, <i>&ldquo;The law in its majestic equality
forbids the rich as well as the poor to steal bread, to sleep under
bridges and to beg for food.&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
Ninety percent of the laws are in defence of property, and most of
the balance are in
the interests of the ruling class. Even today, if all the laws were
applied, nothing would remain of the rights of the trade unions and
working people, quite apart from the Industrial Relations Act. Sir
John Donaldson said sadly that the arrest of the dockers would not
improve industrial relations, for which the Industrial Relations
Court was set up.
</p>
<p>
It is perhaps appropriate that these events take place around the
anniversary of the Tolpuddle case. The 5 dockers are the new
Tolpuddle Martyrs. The Tories sought to avoid creating martyrs
because they feared the reaction of the working class. The IR Act was
used against the T&amp;GWU and the railwaymen. It was intended for
the purpose of building and protecting scab and company unions in
order to split the unity of the working class.
</p>
<p>
<i>The dockers have given the lead. Free the five and away with the
Industrial Relations Act!</i>
</p>
<p>
The
TUC leaders met Heath on Monday night. Instead of playing
clap-handies,
they should issue an ultimatum&mdash;&ldquo;We are calling a one day general
strike as a warning. If you do not release the five, further action
will be taken&rdquo;. Vic Feather, when asked about a general strike on
the radio, parried by declaring, &ldquo;It takes time to organise a
general strike.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Trades
councils in Bristol, Merseyside and elsewhere are calling emergency
meetings. The same must be done all over the country. If the TUC gave
a lead, the trades councils could call conferences of shop-stewards
and special delegates from the trade union branches in every area in
a matter of hours. So there&rsquo;s no difficulty about time in relation
to the problem of calling the strike. <i>The
TUC&rsquo;s South West advisory committee is calling for the TUC to call
a one-day general stoppage.</i>
</p>
<p>
Vic Feather predicted to the government that when the first worker was
arrested under the IR Act &ldquo;all Hell would break loose&rdquo;. We want
Vic Feather and the other members of the TUC to raise a bit of Hell!
</p>
<p>
Heath and his pirate crew must be brought to their knees. This is the worst
government in the whole of this century. It is a government of CBI
puppets and employers&rsquo; stooges. A one-day general strike would
shake this government to its rotting foundations. It is shameful that
the TUC should be collaborating with this government of bankers and
capitalists and with their pay masters&mdash;the Confederation of British
Industry.
</p>
<p>
The
government tested their strength in combating the miners and the
railwaymen. It was only when the working class demonstrated their
power and determination that the government decided to try and use
the TUC to do their dirty work through a &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; incomes
policy. This is not good enough for the labour movement.
</p>
<p>
<i>Using the upheaval provoked by the jailing of the dockers; the TUC, the
Labour Party and the co-op movement&mdash;all the forces of the labour
movement must begin a campaign for the resignation of the Tory
government and a general election and a new government pledged to
socialist policies.</i>
</p>
<p>
In
this connection, some of the Labour leaders have played a shameful
role. Reg Prentice, the shadow minister for employment, said, 
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;I
have no sympathy at all for the jailed dockers. They were wrong to
organise picketing and blacking against the policy of their union.
They were even more wrong to defy the court. The Industrial Relations
Act is a bad law, but it is the law and nobody can claim to be above
it. Trade unionists should not rally round these men as though they
were latter day Tolpuddle Martyrs. They are just not worth it.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Dockers and the rest of the working class would retort that Reg Prentice is
&ldquo;not worth it&rdquo;. What sort of a minister of employment he would
make in a Labour government is indicated by his attitude. On the
other hand, Tom Driberg, a left Labour MP, openly declared in
Parliament that &ldquo;bad laws should be defied.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
<i>Men were not made for laws; laws were made for men. In a class society
&ldquo;The Law&rdquo; is a class law and reflects the interests of the ruling
class.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The trade union movement must break any law which restricts the right of
working people. Marxists have always explained that only that is
right and moral which raises the level of consciousness of the
working class and acts in the interests of the working class.</i>
</p>
<p>
The rank and file docker in London, who when confronted by a reporter
with a statement that the IR Act was the &ldquo;law&rdquo;, replied
briefly&mdash;&ldquo;F*** the law&rdquo;. The Manchester engineer, who
on the radio replied in similar terms&mdash;&ldquo;To hell with the law&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
Laws can be changed. Capitalist law acts in the interests of the
capitalist class. Law introduced by the working class when in power
will be in the interests of the working class. Between the
capitalists and the workers, &ldquo;jungle law&rdquo; always exists and the
issues are always decided by force and power.
</p>
<p>
The power of the capitalists and their state are built on force and
fraud. The power of the working class is built on organisation and
solidarity.
</p>
<p>
In the last two years, provoked by the attacks of the employers and
their government, there has been a demonstration of the power of the
working class. The ruling class produce nothing. Everything is
produced and all the necessary work is done by [the] working
class&mdash;docks, mines, electricity, engineering, power, transport,
food. We create the wealth. The capitalist parasites and their
government waste and squander it.
</p>
<p>
The miners, railwaymen and dockers have shown the immense power that the
working class possesses, once they become conscious of it.
</p>
<p>
Instead of the TUC fooling about with a &ldquo;voluntary incomes policy&rdquo; they
should be explaining to the working class that the cause of the
inflation and the crisis is the policy of the government and the
actions of the employers. A &ldquo;voluntary incomes policy&rdquo; means in
reality a limitation of the wages of the workers in the interests of
the capitalists.
</p>
<p>
Profit is the unpaid labour of the working class, as was explained by Karl
Marx over a century ago. &ldquo;Co-operation&rdquo;
with the CBI&mdash;representatives of the monopolies&mdash;and the
government&mdash;puppet of the CBI&mdash;is the
co-operation of the horse and two riders. Nothing good can come of
such co-operation. In reality, it means a submission to the
government and the ruling class. When the CBI and the government were
pushing through the Industrial Relations Act, they weren&rsquo;t at all
concerned with consulting or co-operating with the organisations of
the working class.
</p>
<p>
Now they have tried it on, and found the working class too strong. The
bitter mood of the working class in repulsing the attacks on their
organisations and standards have convinced the employers and their
government that they must use guile and not force. Hence their plea
for &ldquo;co-operation in the national interest&rdquo; i.e. the interests of
big business. This is the road of betrayal, and demoralisation of the
working class.
</p>
<p>
Lenin and Trotsky pointed out many times the colossal strength of the
organised labour movement in Britain. Without the toleration and
support of the trade union leaders, capitalism and its government
could not last more than a few weeks. The events of the last few
months have demonstrated the absolute truth of these statements.
</p>
<p>
<i>There is no power in
Britain as strong as that of the organised labour movement once it is
conscious of itself.</i>
</p>
<h4>Take over the commanding heights of the economy</h4>
<p class="fst">
Instead of collaboration with the employers and their government, the TUC,
the Labour Party and the co-op should be taking advantage of the mood
of militancy and of bitterness pervading the working class. The
resolutions for the Labour Party conference show the mood of the
working class, and it is a fighting mood. The commanding heights of
the economy&mdash;banks, insurance companies and the 350 monopolies which
control 85 percent of the economy&mdash;must be nationalised, with
minimum compensation on the basis of need. But nationalisation of the
old type is not sufficient as the case of the railwaymen and the
miners has shown. State capitalist nationalisation serves mainly the
interests of the capitalists. What is needed is workers&rsquo; control
and management of industry and the state.
</p>
<p>
All industries that are nationalised must have a board of management
appointed at the annual conference of the TUC and subject to recall
by it. One-third of the board must be appointed by the unions in the
Industry, one-third by the TUC as a whole and one-third by the
government.
</p>
<p>
No manager must receive more than a skilled workers&rsquo; wage. Then we
would have representatives on these boards who truly represented the
interests of the workers and not of the government and private
industry.
</p>
<p>
<i>Britain has enormous wealth. The real problem today is how to organise that
wealth for use and not for private profit.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>This whole issue has blown up because of the cutting down of the number of
dockers from something like over 60,000 to little more than 40,000.
The dockers are justly demanding </i>&ldquo;No
redundancies&rdquo;.<i> The benefit of less dockers
doing more work through containerisation goes to the profits of the
employers. Containerisation yes! Sackings no! Lower the hours without
reduction in pay so that all dockers maintain employment!</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The TUC must organise a one day general strike!</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Force the Tories to resign!</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>For a Labour government committed to socialist policies!</i>
