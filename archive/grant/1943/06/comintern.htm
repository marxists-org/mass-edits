<p class="fst">The Third International has been officially
buried. In the most undignified and contemptible fashion it would
be possible to conceive, it has passed off the stage of history.
Hurriedly and without consultation with all the adhering parties,
not to speak of the rank and file throughout the world, without
any democratic discussion and decision, as the result of the
pressure of American imperialism, Stalin has perfidiously
abandoned the Comintern.</p>


<p>To understand how it is that this organisation
which aroused the terror and hatred of the whole capitalist world
has come to such an inglorious end at the bidding of capitalism,
it is necessary to review briefly the stormy rise and even
stormier decline of the International. The decree for its
dissolution was merely an acknowledgement of what has long been
known to all informed people; that the Comintern as a factor
making for world socialism was dead and had departed forever from
its original aims and purposes. Its demise was predicted and
foreseen long in advance.</p>


<p>The Third International grew out of the
collapse of capitalism in the last war. The Russian revolution
sent a wave of revolutionary fervour through the ranks of the
working class throughout the world. To the war-weary,
disillusioned and embittered masses, it came as a message of
hope, of inspiration and courage, it showed the way out of the
bloody chaos into which capitalism had plunged society. It was
born as a direct consequence of the betrayal and breakdown of the
Second International which supported the ruling classes in the
last war.</p>


<p>The breakdown of imperialism and capitalism was
signalled by the revolutions in Germany, Austria, Hungary,
revolutionary situations in Italy, France and even Britain. The
spectre of socialist revolution hung all over Europe. The memoirs
and writings of nearly all the bourgeois politicians of that time
bear witness to the despair, the lack of confidence of the
bourgeoisie in the face of the fact that they had lost control of
the situation. Social democracy saved capitalism.</p>


<p>The powerful trade-union and socialist
bureaucracies placed themselves at the head of the upsurge of the
masses and diverted it into harmless channels. In Germany, Noske
<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup> and
Scheidemann conspired with the junkers and capitalists to destroy
the revolution. The soviets of workers, soldiers, sailors,
peasants and even students, which had issued from the November
revolution of 1918, held power in their hands. The social
democrats handed the power back to the capitalists.</p>


<p>Gradually, slowly, peacefully, as their
theoretical conceptions explained it, they would transform
capitalism into socialism. In Italy, by 1920 the workers had
seized the factories. Instead of leading the workers to the
conquest of power, the Socialist Party bade them cease
'unconstitutional' procedure. So it was throughout Europe. The
results of this programme are evident today. The worst tyranny
and the bloodiest war in the history of capitalism. But precisely
because of the breakdown of international socialism in the Second
International, which had betrayed Marxism, the Third
International was formed.</p>


<p>As early as the beginning of the last war
(First World War) Lenin had courageously issued the call for the
Third International. The Third International was formally
inaugurated in March 1919. Its declared aims and objects were the
overthrow of world capitalism and the construction of a world
chain of united soviet socialist republics to join up with the
USSR, which itself was not conceived as an independent entity but
merely as the base for the world revolution. Its fate would be
determined and was bound up with the fate of the world
revolution.</p>


<p>The formation of the Third International
swiftly led to the creation of mighty communist parties
throughout the most important countries in the world. In Germany,
France, Czechoslovakia and other countries, communist parties
with a mass membership were created. In Britain a small communist
party was formed which wielded considerable influence. The
success of the world revolution in the next period seemed assured
by the development of events. The communist parties in Europe
were steadily increasing in numbers and influence at the expense
of the social democracy.</p>


<p>The last war had not succeeded in solving any
of the problems of world capitalism. In fact it had aggravated
them. Capitalism had broken down at its 'weakest link' as Lenin
expressed it. The attempts to destroy the young Soviet Republic
by the wars of intervention had completely failed. German
capitalism, the mightiest in Europe, found itself stripped of its
resources, part of its territory, burdened with staggering
reparation payments, and generally placed in an impossible
position. British and French imperialists, the 'victors' in the
last world war, were in a position fundamentally not much better.</p>


<p>Encouraged by the Russian revolution, the
colonial and semi-colonial masses were stirring and preparing to
revolt. The masses at home were restless and uneasy and the
economic position of Anglo-French imperialism had worsened
considerably in comparison with that of Japanese and American
capitalism. It was on this international background that the
crisis broke out in Germany in 1923. Germany with her high
productive capacity was crippled by the restrictions imposed by
Versailles<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup> and had now become the weakest link in the chain of
world capitalism.</p>


<p>The failure of Germany to pay the instalments
on the reparations resulted in the French capitalists marching
into the Ruhr. This helped to complete the collapse of the German
economy, and the German bourgeoisie endeavoured to unload the
burdens onto the shoulders of the working and middle classes. The
mark fell in value from 20 to 40 to the pound in January, to 5
million in July and 47 million at the end of August. The
indignant German masses turned towards communism.</p>


<p>As Brandler, the then leader of the Communist
Party, stated at the meeting of the Executive Committee of the
Comintern: &quot;There were signs of a rising revolutionary movement:
We had temporarily the majority of the workers behind us, and in
this situation believed that under favourable circumstances we
would proceed immediately to the attack...&quot; But unfortunately the
leadership of the International failed to stand up to the test
and take advantage of the opportunity. Success in Germany would
inevitably have led to victory throughout Europe. But as in
Russia of 1917, so in Germany of 1923, sections of the leadership
vacillated.</p>


<p>Stalin, with his organic opportunism, urged
that the German party be 'curbed' from taking any action. The
result was that the favourable opportunity to take power in
Germany was missed and the communists in Germany suffered defeat.
For similar reasons the revolution in Bulgaria also suffered
shipwreck. But the defeats of the revolution in Europe caused by
the failure of the leadership inevitably led to serious
consequences. As Lenin had written, urging the necessity to
prepare for the insurrection, in Russia in 1917: &quot;The success of
the Russian and world revolution depends upon two or three days'
struggle.&quot;<sup><a href="../../../lenin/works/1917/oct/08.htm">[source]</a></sup></p>



<p>The failure of the world revolution and the
isolation of the Soviet Union, taken in conjunction with its
backwardness, the weariness and apathy of the Soviet masses who
had gone through years of war, terrible privations and suffering
during the course of the civil war and the intervention, their
disillusionment and despair at the failure of their hopes of aid
from the workers of Europe: all this led inevitably to reaction
within the USSR.</p>


<p>Reflecting at the time, perhaps unconsciously,
the interests of the reactionary and conservative bureaucracy
which was just beginning to raise itself above the Soviet masses,
Stalin for the first time in 1924 came forward with the utopian
and anti-Leninist theory of 'socialism in one country'. This
'theory' sprang directly from the defeat which the revolution had
suffered in Germany. It indicated a turning away from the
principles of revolutionary internationalism on which the Russian
revolution had been based and on which the Communist
International was founded.</p>


<p>Stalin, at the funeral of Lenin in January
1924, from force of habit following in the tradition of the
Russian revolution declared: &quot;In leaving us Comrade Lenin
enjoined on us fidelity to the Communist International. We swear
to thee, Comrade Lenin, to devote our lives to the enlargement
and strengthening of the union of workers of the whole world, the
Communist International.&quot;
<span class="inote">[Quoted in Trotsky's <em>Stalin</em>, chapter 12, part 2]</span>
At that time he had not the slightest
notion of whither the theory of socialism in one country would
lead the Soviet Union and the Comintern.

</p>


<p>The history of the Comintern since those days
has been largely bound up with the fluctuating policies of the
bureaucracy of the USSR. Lenin had insistently linked the fate of
the Soviet Union with that of the world working class, and
principally of its vanguard the Comintern. Even the oath of the
Red Army pledged the red soldiers to loyalty to the international
working class. Indeed the Red Army was not regarded as an
independent 'national' force, but as one of the instruments of
the world revolution.</p>


<p>Of course, all this has long since been altered
by Stalin. Trotsky, in conjunction with Lenin who, in his last
years, viewed the developing situation with alarm, had already
begun the struggle against the bureaucratisation of the Bolshevik
Party and the Soviet State in 1923. Lenin was warning of the
dangers of degeneration which threatened the Soviet state.</p>


<p>On the background of the growing reaction,
nationally and internationally, the struggle between the
internationalists and the Thermidorians<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-3" name="doc-3">(3)</a></sup> entered into an acute
stage. Trotsky, in alliance with Lenin, had demanded the
restoration of complete democracy within the Bolshevik Party and
the soviets. Lenin, in pursuit of this objective, had demanded
the removal of Stalin from the post of General Secretary of the
party because he had become the focal point around which the
bureaucracy was crystallising.</p>


<p>After Lenin's death, Zinoviev, Kamenev<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-4" name="doc-4">(4)</a></sup> and
Stalin, 'the troika' secured a decision disregarding Lenin's
advice by the Central Committee and commenced a campaign against
Lenin's ideas which were being put forward by Trotsky, with the
spurious invention and legend of 'Trotskyism'. The fate of the
Comintern was linked with the fate of the Bolshevik Party of the
Soviet union which, through its prestige and experience, was
naturally the dominant force in the International.</p>


<p>The transition from the policy of world
revolution to that of socialism in one country expressed a sharp
turn to the right in the Comintern. In Russia, Zinoviev and
Kamenev were forced into opposition by the anti-Marxian policy
now being developed by Stalin. They were thrust into an alliance
with Trotsky and his supporters. Stalin, together with Bukharin,
opposed the policy of industrialising Russia through a series of
five year plans suggested by the Left Opposition led by Trotsky
and came out with his famous aphorism at the plenary meeting of
the Central Committee in April 1927 that 'to attempt to build the
Dnieperstroy hydro-electric station would be the same thing for
us as for a muzhik<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-5" name="doc-5">(5)</a></sup> to buy a gramophone instead of a cow'.
<span class="inote">[Quoted in Trotsky's <em>The Revolution Betrayed</em>, chapter 2
<sup><a href="../../../trotsky/1936/revbet/ch02.htm">[source]</a></sup>]</span></p>


<p>As late as the end of 1927, during the
preparations for the Fifteenth Party Congress, whose task was to
expel the Left Opposition, Molotov said repeatedly: &quot;We must not
slip down into poor peasant illusions about the collectivisation
of the broad masses. In the present circumstances it is no longer
possible.&quot;<span class="inote">[Quoted in Trotsky's <em>The Revolution Betrayed</em>, chapter 2
<sup><a href="../../../trotsky/1936/revbet/ch02.htm">[source]</a></sup>]</span>
 Inside Russia the policy was to allow the kulaks (rich
peasants) and the Nepmen (capitalists in the towns - so-called
after the New Economic Policy of 1921), full scope for economic
development. This policy was perfectly typified by the slogan
coined by Bukharin with the full support of Stalin, given out to
the peasantry: 'Enrich yourselves!'</p>


<p>The policy of the Comintern was now pushed far
to the right with the preoccupation of Stalin to find allies to
'defend the Soviet Union from attack'. The Comintern was already
being reduced to the role of a border guard. The disagreements
within the Bolshevik Party and the International flared up over
the question of the Chinese revolution and the situation in
Britain. In China during 1925-7 the revolution was stirring up
the millions of Asia into action. The Comintern, instead of
relying on the workers and peasants to carry through the
revolution, as was the Leninist policy in Russia, preferred to
rely on the Chinese capitalists and generals.</p>


<p>The Left Opposition warned of the consequences
of this policy. The Chinese Communist Party was the sole workers'
party in China and had a dominating influence over the working
class; the peasantry were looking towards the example in Russia
to show them the way out of their centuries-long suffering at the
bands of the landlords, through the seizure of the land. But the
Comintern stubbornly refused to take the road of working-class
independence which Lenin had insisted on as the prerequisite for
communist policy in relation to the bourgeois-democratic and
anti-imperialist revolutions in the East.</p>


<p>Meanwhile a similar policy was pursued in
Britain where the masses were undergoing a process of intense
radicalisation. As a means of struggling against intervention
against the Soviet Union the Russian trade unions made an
agreement with the General Council of the TUC. The tendency
towards revolutionary developments in Britain is seen in the fact
that a million members, a quarter of the trade-union membership,
were organised in the Minority Movement<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-6" name="doc-6">(6)</a></sup>. Trotsky, analysing the
situation in Britain, had predicted the outbreak of a general
strike.</p>


<p>The task of the Communist Party and the
Communist International should have been to prepare the workers
for the inevitability of a betrayal on the part of the
trade-union leadership. Instead, they sowed illusions in the
minds of the workers, especially as the trade-union bureaucrats
had covered themselves with the agreement with the Russian trade
unions, whose prestige they utilised as a cloak. After the
betrayal of the 1926 general strike by the trade-union
bureaucracy, Trotsky demanded that the Russian trade unions
should break off relations with the TUC. This Stalin and the
Comintern refused to do.</p>


<p>After using the Anglo-Russian Committee for as
long as they needed, more than a year after the General Strike,
the British trade-union leadership broke off relations. The
Comintern let out a howl that they had been betrayed. But
meanwhile the young Communist Party of Great Britain which should
have increased its membership by leaps and bounds as a result of
these great events, was paralysed and disorientated by the policy
of the International, was completely discredited and dwindled in
influence among the masses. These further defeats of the
International, due directly to the policy of Stalin and the
bureaucracy, at first sight paradoxically, increased the power of
the bureaucracy within the Soviet Union.</p>


<p>The Soviet masses were further disheartened and
disillusioned by these new defeats of the international
proletariat and suffered a further decline in spirits. The
defeats which had been a direct consequence of the policy of
Stalin and the bureaucracy further strengthened its hold on the
Soviet Union. The Left Opposition led by Trotsky which had
correctly analysed and forecast these developments was now
expelled from the Bolshevik Party and from the International.</p>


<p>The internal results of Stalin's policy now
began to bear fruit in the alarming growth of the strength and
influence of the kulaks and of the Nepmen. The Soviet Union stood
on the brink of disaster. In panic and terror Stalin and the
bureaucracy were compelled to adopt a caricature of the very
policy for which Trotsky and his co-thinkers had been expelled.
In Russia the Five Year Plans against which Stalin had so
strenuously fought were introduced.</p>


<p>It is on the basis of this planned production
that the Soviet Union achieved its greatest successes and on
which the present day USSR bases itself in war. Meanwhile the
panic turn to the left internally was reflected in a panic turn
to the left internationally. Stalin had burned his fingers badly
in his attempts to lean on capitalist elements in China and to
conciliate social democracy. Now he veered the International
sharply in the opposite direction. In violation of its statutes
the International did not hold a conference for four years. A new
conference was called which introduced officially the programme
of the Communist International. It also proclaimed the end of
capitalist stability and the beginning of what was termed the
'Third Period'. This was supposed to usher in the period of the
final collapse of world capitalism. At the same time the social
democracy, according to the once-famous (but now buried) theory
of Stalin, was supposed to have transformed itself into 'social
fascism'. No agreements were now possible with 'social fascists'
who constituted the main danger confronting the working class and
must be destroyed.</p>


<p>It was just at this period that the
unprecedented slump of 1929-33 affected the world. In particular
it hit Germany. The German workers were thrust into a position of
degradation and misery and the middle classes were ruined.
Germany's unemployment figure rose steadily till at the peak it
reached 8,000,000. The middle class, having failed to receive
anything from the revolution of 1918, and disappointed with the
failure of the communists in 1923 to take power, now in anguish
and despair began to look for a solution to their problems in a
different direction.</p>


<p>Subsidised and financed by the capitalists, the
fascists began to secure a mass basis in Germany. In the
elections of September 1930, they secured nearly six and a half
million votes. Despite their expulsion from the Communist
International, Trotsky and his followers still considered
themselves as part of it and insistently demanded that they be
allowed to return to the ranks. At the same time they subjected
the suicidal theory, which had now been adopted by the Comintern,
to a sharp criticism. In place of it they demanded a return to
the realistic Leninist policy of the united front<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-7" name="doc-7">(7)</a></sup> as a
means of winning the masses in action and through their own
experience, to communism.</p>


<p>With the victory of Hitler at the polls Trotsky
sounded the alarm. In a pamphlet entitled <em>The Turn in the
Communist International - the Situation in Germany </em>he issued
a signal for a campaign, which was carried on for three years by
the International Left Opposition of the Comintern, as the
Trotskyists looked on themselves. In Germany, France, USA,
Britain, in far away South Africa, and in all countries where
they had groups, the Trotskyists conducted a campaign demanding
that the German Communist Party set into motion a campaign for a
united front with the Social Democrats to prevent Hitler from
coming to power.</p>


<p>At the direct instructions and bidding from
Stalin and the Comintern, the German Communist Party denounced
this policy as a counter-revolutionary 'social fascist' one. They
insistently fought against social democracy as the 'main enemy'
of the working class and argued that there was no difference
between democracy and fascism. In September 1930, the <em>Rote
Fahne</em>, organ of the German CP proclaimed: &quot;Last night
was Herr Hitler's greatest day, but the so-called election
victory of the nazis is the beginning of the end.&quot; <span class="inote">[September 15, 1930]</span></p>


<p>Right throughout these years the Comintern
continued its fatal course. When Hitler organised a referendum in
1931 to oust the Social Democratic government in Prussia, at the
direct insistence of Stalin and the Comintern the German
communists voted with the nazis against the social democrats. As
late as May 1932, the British <em>Daily Worker </em>could proudly
indict the Trotskyists for their policy in Germany thus: &quot;It is
significant that Trotsky has come out in defence of a united
front between communist and social democratic parties against
fascism. No more disruptive and counter-revolutionary class lead
could possibly have been given at the time like the present.&quot;</p>


<p>Meanwhile Trotsky had written four pamphlets
and dozens of articles and manifestos; everywhere the
international Trotskyists explored every avenue to exert pressure
on the Comintern to change its policy. In vain. In January 1933
Hitler was enabled to take power without any organised opposition
whatsoever in a country with the most highly organised working
class and with the strongest Communist Party outside of Russia.</p>


<p>For the first time in history reaction was
enabled to conquer power without any resistance on the part of
the working class. The German CP numbered 6,000,000 supporters,
the Social Democracy numbered 8,000,000 - together they were the
mightiest force in Germany. By this betrayal, the German CP was
doomed forever.</p>


<p>But the Comintern was far from recognising the
nature of the catastrophe. Instead, it solemnly endorsed the
policy of the German CP and of the International as having been
perfectly correct. An organisation which cannot learn from the
lessons of history is doomed. As a force for world socialism, the
Communist International was dead. The International Left
Opposition broke away and proclaimed the necessity of a new
international. But what was apparent to the vanguard who had
abandoned the attempt to reform the Comintern, could not be
apparent to the broad masses. Only great events could teach them.</p>


<p>The Communist International continued to carry
on this false policy right up to 1934. When the fascists in
France, encouraged by the successes of fascism in Austria and
Germany, conducted armed demonstrations for the overthrow of the
Liberal government and parliament, the CP issued orders to
demonstrate with them. But now the full danger which Hitler
represented to the Soviet Union was apparent to everyone. Stalin
and the bureaucracy became panic-stricken. Contemptuous and
cynical of the capacity of the Comintern as an instrument of
world revolution, Stalin more openly converted it into an
instrument of Russian foreign policy.</p>


<p>An organisation in class society which ceases
to represent the working class inevitably falls under the
pressure and influence of the bourgeoisie. Stalin, in his search
for allies, now turned to the bourgeoisie of Britain and France.
The 'Popular Front' policy was initiated and endorsed at the last
Congress of the International held in 1935. This policy of
coalition with the Liberal capitalists is one against which Lenin
had struggled all his life. It represented a new stage in the
degeneration of the Comintern and the first workers' state.</p>


<p>With the rise of Hitler, again due to the
policies of Stalin, the stranglehold of the bureaucracy within
the Soviet Union was further increased. Higher over the Soviet
masses has the bureaucratic caste raised itself and increased its
power. But this progressive degeneration has had qualitative
changes. From merely being incapable of insuring anything but
defeats for the world working class, Stalinism has become opposed
to the workers' revolution in other countries. The Moscow trials,
the murder of the old Bolsheviks, the purges, the murder and
exile of tens of thousands of the flower of the Russian communist
workers, completed the Stalinist counter-revolution within the
Soviet Union.</p>


<p>Events in France and Spain<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-8" name="doc-8">(8)</a></sup> are
fresh in every revolutionary's mind. The Comintern played the
main role in destroying the revolution which could have been
accomplished. Indeed, it revealed itself as the fighting vanguard
of the counter-revolution. The defeats of the world working class
inevitably led to the new world war. Ironically, the war was
ushered in by a pact between Hitler and Stalin. Thus Stalin dealt
new blows to the world working class and the Comintern. It now
executed a somersault and conducted a campaign for peace in the
interests of Hitler, with a skilful counterfeit of a
'revolutionary' policy.</p>


<p>As Trotsky forecast in his prediction of the
Stalin-Hitler agreement in an article written in March 1933:</p>


<p class="quote">&quot;The fundamental trait of Stalin's
international policy in recent years has been this: that he
trades in the working-class movements just as he trades in oil,
manganese and other goods. In this statement there is not an iota
of exaggeration. Stalin looks upon the sections of the Comintern
in various countries and upon the liberating struggle of the
oppressed nations as so much small change in deals with
imperialist powers. When he requires the aid of France, he
subjects the French proletariat to the radical bourgeoisie. When
he has to support China against Japan, he subjects the Chinese
proletariat to the Kuomintang. What would he do in the event of
an agreement with Hitler? Hitler, to be sure, does not
particularly require Stalin's assistance to strangle the German
Communist Party. The insignificant state in which the latter
finds itself has moreover been assured by its entire preceding
policy. But it is very likely that Stalin would agree to cut off
all subsidies for illegal work in Germany. This is one of the
most minor concessions that he would have to make and he would be
quite willing to make it. One should also assume that the noisy,
hysterical and hollow campaign against fascism which the
Comintern has been conducting for the last few years will be
slyly squelched.&quot;</p>


<p class="fst">This policy of Stalin and the 'stinking corpse'
of the Comintern suffered irretrievable ruin when the nazis
invaded the Soviet Union. The Comintern had to execute a right
about turn and convert itself once again into a doormat for
Roosevelt and British imperialism. But with the increased
dependence of Stalin on American and British imperialism, has
come the increased pressure on the part of capitalist 'allies'.
American imperialism especially has demanded the ending of the
Comintern as a final guarantee against the danger of social
revolution in Europe after the downfall of Hitler.</p>


<p>The long drawn-out pretence is over. Stalin has
dissolved the degenerate Comintern. In doing so he openly
announces his stepping over to the side of the capitalist
counter-revolution as far as the rest of the world is concerned.
But the imperialists, in forcing Stalin to make this trade in
return for concessions and bargains on their part, have not
understood the consequences this will have. It cannot and will
not prevent the coming of new revolutions throughout the world.
In the less than two decades since the beginning of its
degeneration, the Comintern has ruined many favourable situations
in many countries.</p>


<p>The coming decades will witness many
revolutions with the breakdown and collapse of capitalism. Even
the violently disturbed epoch of the period between the wars will
seem comparatively tranquil compared to the period which lies
ahead. On this background of storms and upheavals a real
instrument of world revolution will be created. What the workers
lacked in the last decades, outside Russia, was a workers'
Bolshevik Party and a Bolshevik leadership. The great days of the
Comintern of 1917-23 will live again. The growth in support for
the ideas of Marxism internationally, based on the traditions of
Bolshevism, the rich experience of the past, and learning the
lessons of defeats of the working class, can once again lead the
oppressed to the overthrow of capitalism and to the world
socialist republic.</p>
