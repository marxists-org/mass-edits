<p class="fst">The I.L.P. Conference this year provides instructive
material on the evolution and direction of this Party. Under the
influence of the beginnings of mass radicalisation of the working
class, the I.L.P. is increasing its membership and its influence
fairly considerably. For the first time for years the finances of
the Party are in a sound position. Taking all these factors into
consideration the leadership seems to have regarded with
satisfaction the proceedings of their Jubilee Conference.</p>

<p>The changes in mass consciousness in Britain are revealing
themselves in many ways. A political ferment and awakening is
taking place among large sections of the working class. The middle
class is beginning to break away from allegiance to the traditional
parties of British capitalism, as the growth and success of the
Common Wealth movement [1] has shown. The by-election success of
the anti-Government candidates, on a vague programme of
pseudo-Socialism or social reform, has shown the steady drift of
the masses towards the Left and towards Socialism. Among the basic
mass of the Labour workers a feeling of disgust and uneasiness at
the association of the leadership with the Tories in the government
has been growing. The masses are beginning to discern the real
meaning of the coalition with finance capital. A movement for the
ending of the electoral truce is gaining momentum among the workers
in the Trade Unions, Co-operatives and within the Labour Party. It
is on this background of the beginnings of mass upsurge, that the
I.L.P. has gained its modest successes.</p>

<p>A comparison between last year&rsquo;s Conference and the one
just held indicates the effect that these developments are having
externally and internally on the I.L.P.</p>

<p>At the last Conference a sharp swing to the Left was to be
observed among the membership and a process of differentiation
taking place. For the first time for years real lively discussion
and a critical attitude on the part of the membership could be
seen. A tendency to seek a policy reflecting a genuine
revolutionary solution towards the problems facing the working
class. As a reflection of this a left-wing tendency was
crystallised, weak and inexperienced perhaps, but orienting itself
on the platform of Bolshevism. Faced with a growing opposition of
this kind, the leadership revealed itself in its true Centrist
character, though this time garbed in a cloak of sectarianism. The
basic issue at last year&rsquo;s Conference was the question of the
Socialist Britain Now Campaign [2] and the problem of the Labour
Party. The young left wing put forward the correct Marxist
position&mdash;the need to conduct agitation among the masses
around a programme which would have as its key issue, the demand to
the labour leadership to end the coalition and wage a struggle for
power on a Socialist Programme. The leadership of the I.L.P.
recoiled from this with horror though refusing to face up to the
problem of how to expose the Labour leadership.</p>

<p>Nothing could reveal the difference between Marxism and Centrism
better than the attitude towards this question. In it is summed up
the tremendous gulf that lies between an assimilation of Leninism
and a serious attitude towards the problem of preparing and
organising a Party of the Socialist Revolution, and the
superficiality and shallowness of Centrism. For this
question&mdash;the key question of revolutionary policy for
Britain&mdash;and the methods adopted to approach its solution
contains within itself the necessity to understand and appreciate
the mode of development of the working class towards the socialist
revolution, an appreciation of the meaning and role of reformism,
the necessity to educate the masses through their own experience,
and an understanding of the decisive role which a party armed with
a correct policy and method, can and should play in such a
situation.</p>

<p>Despite the leadership, the delegates striving to find a way out
of their isolation from the masses which the Socialist Britain Now
Campaign signally failed to dispel, passed the resolution of Labour
to Power on a Socialist programme [3] by a big majority, without
perhaps clearly understanding this policy.</p>

<p>The twelve months that have passed since then have confirmed
completely the correctness of the analysis made by the Fourth
Internationalists. Even the leadership of the I.L.P. has become
aware of the sterility of their previous policy. The progressive
movement of the Trade Unionist and Labour workers away from the
strangling embrace of the coalition with Big Business and towards
class independence, has already reached such proportions that they
are beginning to observe what is taking place beyond their noses.
Large numbers of Union Branches, Labour Parties and even some
individual leaders of the L.P. and Trade Union movement, under the
pressure of the mass feeling, have come out against the coalition.
Alas! They have not even given a single thought or a glance in the
direction of the Socialist Britain Now Campaign. Naturally, this
development which they had not foreseen, has thrown the leadership
off balance. A Marxist leadership could predict, assess and help to
accelerate the awakening of the Labour masses and simultaneously
warn and prepare them for the inevitable sell-out of the Labour
leadership. In that lies the essence of the policy of Labour to
Power [4]. Not so the leadership of the I.L.P. Trotsky once said
sectarians were really opportunists afraid of their opportunism.
That is especially so with the I.L.P. leadership, except of course
that their opportunism is really organic. If their previous
sectarian attitude had even a grain of sense or the semblance of an
argument in its favour it was in pointing out the dangers of a mass
reaction and disillusionment and despair on the part of the masses
at a new betrayal on the part of the Labour leadership. It is
precisely this aspect of their argument that they have cast
aside.</p>

<p><em>Maxton, at the recent Jubilee Conference, spoke of the
&ldquo;revolutionary potentialities&rdquo; of the Labour Party.
Brockway, at the public rally in the evening spoke of converting
the Labour Party to Socialism. Thus it is that the leadership
tramples on and hastily abandons the position of yesterday. One
thing, and one thing only, remains the same. The decisive refusal
under any and all conditions to expose the real nature of the
Labour leadership.</em></p>

<p>Last year when the leadership found itself in a tight corner
over the question of why they refused to put forward the idea of
Labour to Power, while at the same time they refrained from putting
up candidates against the Labour Party at by-elections, Maxton
unctuously explained that &ldquo;they did not have sufficient
money&rdquo;. Brockway gave the same explanation at a Socialist
Britain Now Conference when confronted with the question by the
Trotskyists. But if this were so the leadership had the
responsibility to raise seriously before the membership at the last
Conference, the need to collect money for the purpose. Their
failure to do so was, at best, a dereliction of duty. However, a
contrast between the last Conference and the Jubilee Conference
will demonstrate that this was a simple but <em>very unprincipled
manoeuvre</em> designed to cover up their affinity to the Labour
bureaucracy. Brockway and the Centrists internationally have
spilled no little ink in their virtuous indignation at the
so-called &ldquo;amorality&rdquo; of Bolshevism-Trotskyism. The
tactical &ldquo;means&rdquo; of the revolutionists are distorted
and falsified and pictured as &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; and for this
reason unlikely to achieve the desired &ldquo;ends&rdquo;. But when
it suits their own ends, the I.L.P. leadership are prepared to use
precisely the &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; means which they so falsely
attribute to the Trotskyists and Leninists.</p>

<p>Never under any conditions could Bolsheviks stoop to methods
such as this. The prime task of the revolution after all, consists
in the education of the masses and of the Party. Not having any
real principles the Centrists cannot explain honestly their stand
on a question of this sort because their whole position consists of
evasions and subterfuges. To make a principled stand would force
them to take outright the reformist or the revolutionary position.
The solution of the N.A.C. [4] is simply to avoid the issue and to
deceive their own members. Thus awkward thoughts and moods on the
part of the membership are avoided. In this way does I.L.P.ism
differ from Revolutionary Socialism in its attitude towards the
membership of its party and towards the working class.</p>

<p>This happy solution of the problem was not open to the
leadership this year. To use the excuse of &ldquo;lack of
money&rdquo; would be too blatant in [the] face of the financial
resources they hold, and even the most inexperienced delegate would
not have believed it. A resolution was put forward from one of the
Scottish Branches suggesting that if the truce was upheld at the
Labour Party Conference, the I.L.P. should contest by-elections
against the Labour Party as well as against Tories. Naturally, the
platform opposed this with all the strength at its command. Maxton,
in moving the rejection of amendments which castigated the role of
the Labour leadership, argued that the Labour leaders in the main,
were decent, well-intentioned fellows and the rank and file labour
workers were as much to blame as the leaders for the situation
today! Thus the I.L.P. places the deceiver and the deceived on the
same level. What then, is the function of leadership? Perhaps the
leadership should follow the rank and file. Thus it is that Maxton,
Brockway and the other leaders of the I.L.P. reveal their real lack
of elementary Marxist training. But the rejection of the resolution
to put up candidates on Maxton&rsquo;s excuses at this Conference,
is a clear indication of the real policy of the N.A.C.&mdash;the
policy of left flank of Labour reformism!</p>

<p>The resolutions which the leadership pushed through indicate
that the realisation of the barrenness of the Socialist Britain Now
Campaign and its obvious impotence to win the masses, has led to a
capitulation to the Labour bureaucracy. It is clear that at the
first convenient opportunity the I.L.P. will re-affiliate to the
Labour Party. This will probably come at the moment when the sweep
of the mass movement compels the Trade Union and Labour leadership
reluctantly to end the coalition with the Tories. From the point of
view of the Labour bureaucracy, if the I.L.P. were really a
revolutionary force, they would oppose re-affiliation tooth and
nail. But it is precisely the lack of a real consistent
revolutionary policy which would entail as one of its indispensable
prerequisites an implacable struggle against the Labour Leadership,
which will secure a smooth passage for the I.L.P. They will not and
cannot raise the question of affiliation by appealing to the rank
and file to support them on a revolutionary policy, thus raising
the same issue as an important means of educating mass opinion, but
will rely on negotiations with the Labour leadership, negotiations
which all the indications show, have already been taking place.</p>

<p>If the I.L.P. were a revolutionary party affiliation under such
conditions would be disastrous. But precisely because it is not
revolutionary, the move of the I.L.P. towards the Labour Party is a
progressive step and can have progressive repercussions. It can
promote a rapid differentiation within the I.L.P. This does not
mean of course, that the revolutionary wing of the I.L.P. should
refrain from fighting for a principled fusion and accept the
attitude of the leadership as at all progressive. On the contrary,
they must intensify the struggle to expose the capitulation of the
N.A.C. and educate the widest sections of the party cadres. Once
inside the Labour Party, the evolution and crystallisation of the
wings will be speeded up. The leadership will be reinforced by such
&ldquo;Lefts&rdquo; as Cove, Messer and others in the Labour
Party.</p>

<p>A big section of the Left workers in the Labour Party tend to
gravitate towards the I.L.P. While the leadership would more and
more adapt itself to the Left reformists and the policy of the
I.L.P. would swing sharply to the right. This in its turn would
inevitably result in accelerating the education and regroupment of
the revolutionary socialist elements within the I.L.P. With the
necessity to wage a struggle against the now left reformist
leadership, the ideas of the nascent Left wing would be clarified.
It would, if it was not to decay and disintegrate completely, find
the road to the methods and principles of Bolshevism.</p>

<p>The danger is, however, that the confusion of the ultra-lefts
will add further to the lack of clarity, by their opposition to
re-affiliation. The palpable opportunism of the leadership may
drive a section of the best elements in this direction. Although,
of course, after an initial opposition the ultra-lefts will
inevitably capitulate to the leadership. Unless the revolutionary
wing succeed in clarifying the issues in the coming months, some of
the proletarian elements will be driven along the road of
organisational adventures which can only retard the building of the
revolutionary party which in turn can but be the party of the
Fourth International.</p>

<p>This Conference, far more than the last, revealed the I.L.P. in
a state of flux. The discussions and the proceedings revealed a
state of tremendous confusion in the minds of the delegates and
even more so in the leadership. Not a single issue was debated in a
manner which would clarify the problems raised and lift the rank
and file delegates to a higher political plane. The time of
conference was wasted on trivialities while the leadership [?] and
slurred over principled issues. The leadership used the overloaded
agenda, which contained dozens of trivial amendments which could
easily have been disposed of through the Standing Orders Committee.
The result was that on some of the basic resolutions and
amendments, no real discussion took place. Half an hour was
allotted for the discussion on India, including a speech from the
platform! Even on some of the [?] basic resolutions no thorough
discussion could take place. The result was to reduce some of the
Conference proceedings to little less than a farce. The leadership
has full responsibility for this situation, which suited them
completely. Because of this the tendencies at the Conference were
not as clearly marked out from one another as they would otherwise
have been. What discussion did take place though, was sufficient to
reveal the heterogeneous character of the composition of the
I.L.P.</p>

<p>The pacifist tendency, though obviously on the downward grade,
was vociferous and still retained a substantial support. But the
working class core of the I.L.P. has been moving steadily away from
this position. The parliamentary group and the N.A.C. betrayed by
their speeches that nothing fundamental separates them from the
reformism of the Labour Party. The leadership revealed itself as
rather nervous at the prospect of a discussion on basic
principles.</p>

<p>The left-wing tendency moving in the direction of Bolshevism,
though young and inexperienced in the face of the old and
experienced parliamentarians such as Maxton, made a far bigger
impression than at the previous Conference. They were clearly
finding their feet and securing more support and clearer support in
that section of the Conference looking for a genuine Left lead. In
addition, they showed a growth of confidence in themselves and
their case and stood up well to the leadership, who tried by
numerous tricks to put them off their stride. Unfortunately, the
Left wing in the I.L.P. is not homogeneous and there is a weak but
distinct tendency towards ultra-leftism.</p>

<p>The confusion within the membership, the hurried nature of the
discussions, all led inevitably to the victory of the platform.
Voting at Conferences very often does not give a clear indication
of processes taking place, and especially is this so where the
differences are not clarified. On those issues where a fair amount
of discussion took place, the left-wing opposition, in all its
tendencies, generally secured 40 or 50 votes, that is from a
quarter to a third of the Conference delegates. However, this would
not necessarily be a clear assessment of the strength of the
opposition.</p>

<p>The confusion of the leadership on even elementary questions was
indicated in the discussion on Fascism. A Marxian amendment was
moved showing how fascism arose as a mass movement after the
failure of the working class to take power in a revolutionary
crisis through the failure and sabotage of its organisations; its
difference with the rule of capitalists under bourgeois democracy
lying in the complete destruction of all organisations of the
working class. As usual with the leadership they opposed this
amendment and managed to confuse content with form. The so-called
&ldquo;planning&rdquo; of the State under fascism, which has its
counterpart in the bourgeois democratic state machine at the
present time they have identified as the essence of fascism. The
result of all this confusion is seen in the fact that a delegate
could get up on the day after the discussion and blandly announce
that fascism, if the masses were not vigilant, could be introduced
by the Tories, and even more as a menace, <em>could be introduced
by the Labour Party! This statement went by without disturbing the
platform in the least and without any comment on their part
whatsoever.</em> And why not? Ridley writes the same sort of arrant
nonsense in the pages of the <em>New Leader</em> without comment or
reply from the Editorial board. So light-minded are the leadership
of the I.L.P.! They are preparing to enter a party which apparently
can impose fascism! Thus they teach and educate the members. Here,
Comrade Maxton, lies precisely the task of leadership. Conferences
in a Bolshevik Party are not meant for the purpose of merely
pushing through resolutions and policy, but through discussion they
act as a means of clarifying the understanding of the advanced
elements in the party as to the basic problems facing the workers.
The delegates in their turn assist in educating the rank and file
on their return to the Branches and thus enrich and strengthen the
Party.</p>

<p>The confusion of course, arises from the position of the
leadership. On the Beveridge Plan they took an out-and-out
reformist stand, exactly that of Marton; in the House of Commons,
which differs in no wise from that of the Labour Party or the
Stalinists. Pious references, after lauding the Beveridge Report,
to the realisation that Socialism alone could solve the problems of
the workers, could easily be paralleled in the statements of these
other organisations. The leadership managed to force through their
position again mainly due to the restricted period given to
discussion.</p>

<p>The only reference to C.P. affiliation to the Labour Party was
made by John McGovern who announced that affiliation by
&ldquo;gangster Communism&rdquo; would mark the end of the Labour
Party. While we can agree wholeheartedly with a denunciation of
Stalinism, such a method of approaching the problem is the worst
that can possibly be made. Hundreds of the mass organisations of
the working class have passed resolutions in favour of affiliation
and the idea of &ldquo;unity&rdquo;. Mere denunciation of Stalinism
will not convince the workers who support or sympathise with their
application. The present position of the I.L.P. on this is even
worse than their previous silence. In its Editorial Column the
<em>New Leader</em> quotes the threats of the Transport
Union&rsquo;s bureaucrats to disaffiliate if the C.P. should
succeed in gaining a majority for its application. Instead of
castigating these leaders, who are from a different angle just as
reactionary as the Stalinist leadership, the <em>New Leader</em>
quotes this as an indication that C.P. affiliation would disrupt
the Labour Party! This argument will certainly render more easy a
future application for affiliation from the I.L.P. But it has
nothing in common with a revolutionary attitude towards the
question. The threat of these Trade Union bosses, who incidentally
have not consulted their members on the question, is reactionary
through and through. Their objection to C.P. affiliation is not
made at all because of the present strike-breaking policy of the
C.P. but from the viewpoint of conservative bureaucrats. Certain
sections of the trade union bureaucracy have come out in favour of
C.P. affiliation largely because they believe that the C.P. will
serve as a means of disciplining the workers. There is not a pin to
choose between all these bureaucrats. Our attitude of supporting
the affiliation as a means of facilitating the exposure of all
these gentlemen and the revolutionary regroupment of the
workers&rsquo; movement is the only principled Marxist one, and the
only one which can clarify the issue for the workers.</p>

<p>Incidentally, we notice that the I.L.P. leadership has no qualms
in denouncing the treacherous Stalinist Leadership! In this
connection we may note that the booklet published by the I.L.P. to
celebrate its Jubilee, proudly quotes the I.L.P.&rsquo;s rejection
of Lenin&rsquo;s attitude on this question.</p>

<p>During an interview with &ldquo;Lenin and the Executive of the
Communist International which Radek was then secretary, to which
they submitted a series of questions and brought back the terms of
affiliation now known as &ldquo;The 21 Points&rdquo;, decisively
rejected at the I.L.P. Conference the following year&hellip;&rdquo;
(the following ideas were developed)</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip;it was not considered essential that the I.L.P.
should leave the Labour Party, but if it remained affiliated it
would be expected to continually fight against its policy and its
personnel, acting upon the assumption that its leaders were
treacherously betraying the working class movement. To this
Wallhead replied that he could not conceive the I.L.P. pursuing a
policy of that description&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This among other things, prevented the affiliation of the I.L.P.
to the Communist International in its revolutionary period. Much
water has flown under the bridges since those days. There have been
revolutions and counter-revolutions and the world has been plunged
into a new imperialist war. But the I.L.P. leadership has not
understood or been changed by these events and has not altered its
attitude. In 1920 they rejected the Leninist position and moved
from the middle of the road back to a reformist position. On a new
level the I.L.P. leadership is repeating its history. But this time
with different results which will be entirely unexpected to the
leadership.</p>

<p>This Conference clearly indicates that the evolution of the
I.L.P. is being speeded up. The leadership has the illusion that
their apparent victory at the Conference has ensured a big growth
and a pleasant haven within the Labour Party at a later stage.
Nothing could be further from reality. It is virtually certain that
in the next period the I.L.P. will enter on a period of extensive
growth, especially if the truce is broken and they affiliate to the
Labour Party. However, coming events in Britain will put every
programme to the test. The revolutionary working class elements in
the I.L.P. will inevitably, as they gather experience in the mass
movement, correctly realise the real nature of Centrism.</p>

<p>The leading figures of the I.L.P. never tire of [?] the
&ldquo;internationalism&rdquo; of the Party. This was emphasised by
every leading speaker at the Jubilee Conference. In recent weeks
Brockway has penned several articles on the question of the
&ldquo;New International&rdquo; which completely shirk the issue.
Instead of raising the question of their international relations
and international programme for a full discussion at the
Conference, the leadership evaded the issue completely. The
Standing Orders Committee, no doubt reflecting the position of the
N.A.C. (since the issue is slid over in that body&rsquo;s report)
rejected a resolution from a London Branch which would have raised
the whole problem for a principled discussion. A reference back on
this question was defeated by a little over a dozen votes. It is no
wonder that the I.L.P. leadership avoids a discussion on
internationalism. The fate of the essentially fictitious London
Bureau, which Brockway piously refers as the I.L.P.&rsquo;s
national affiliates, speaks too much against the I.L.P.&rsquo;s
methods on the international arena. The American affiliate of the
Lovestoneites which the I.L.P. boasted was stronger than the
Trotskyists, committed the unprecedented step in the working class
movement of committing suicide and dissolving itself. The Norwegian
group long ago reverted back to the Second International. The
German S.A.P. came out for support of the &ldquo;democracies&rdquo;
in the war. The French group of Doriot finished up in the camp of
fascism. The latest reports indicate that the former Swedish
section has now fused with the Communist Party.</p>

<p>The best and most resolute party of the Centrists, the Spanish
P.O.U.M. proved incapable of facing the test of the revolution and
through its own vacillation and indecision, was largely responsible
for the disastrous defeat of the Spanish revolution and its own
destruction.</p>

<p>Within the I.L.P. there were as many groupings and tendencies
moving in different directions as there were in the ill-fated
London Bureau. The fact that the I.L.P. will in all probability
gain tremendously in numbers and influence is the guarantee of the
future. On the contrary, the process of differentiation and of
sharp clashes between the differing and antagonistic groupings
would be intensified by the incapacity of the leadership to give a
revolutionary lead to the working class. The all-inclusive Bureau
collapsed. The I.L.P.&rsquo;s methods of building the International
are precisely the same as its methods of building the Party. The
all-inclusive Party will suffer a similar fate as the all-inclusive
International.</p>

<p>However, there is a large and growing left wing in the I.L.P.
composed almost exclusively of working class elements which is
striving to transform the I.L.P. into a revolutionary socialist
party. The main task of this grouping consists in theoretical
education, training and hardening out of its forces. With correct
and systematic work it should win the best elements of the I.L.P.
workers towards a genuine Marxist policy. The debacle of the I.L.P.
is inevitable. But the best elements inevitably break completely
with centrism and find that the methods and policy of the Fourth
International alone can build a revolutionary Party as an
instrument for emancipation of the working class.</p>
