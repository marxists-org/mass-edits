<p class="fst">The dismissal of Mussolini marks a new epoch in
the development of the revolution and the decay and disintegration of
imperialism on the continent of Europe. In order to appreciate the
trends of development in the Italian peninsula, it is necessary to
understand the causes which led Italy to take the road of fascist
barbarism first among all the countries in Europe, and is now the first
country in the war to turn towards revolution.</p>
 
<p>Italy
has always been one of the most backward of the great powers. The
pesantry as in Russia has been burdened by the impositions of the great
landowners; the impoverished proletariat, even before the last war,
built up a powerful socialist movement as a means of conducting the
struggle against the bourgeoisie. Italy's participation in the last war
was essentially that of a second rate power, and though nominally on
the side of the victors, Italy's gains in the last war were negligible.
The weakened Italian bourgeoisie faced with the ruin of the Italian
economy, attempted to load the burdens of &quot;reconstruction&quot; as they had
those of the war, onto the shoulders of the Italian masses.</p>

 <p>It
was as a reply to this offensive of the bourgeoisie that the masses of
Italian workers and peasants launched the counteroffensive with
brilliant success. The years 1918-20 marked the period of &quot;anarchy&quot; for
Italian capitalism. The working class, and following them, the
peasantry, forced tremendous concessions from the ruling class. By
September 1920, the workers had seized the factories and industries,
and the peasants had occupied the land. The real power was no longer in
the hands of the capitalists, who were paralysed with fear, but in the
hands of the working class. What was necessary was a Bolshevik Party to
draw the conclusions for the masses from this and guide the workers to
the conquest of power.</p>
 
<p>The reformist leadership of
the working class was incapable of drawing the lessons. Blind and
impotent, they betrayed the movement and guided it back into the
channels of &quot;constitutionalism&quot;. Thus they prepared the way for the
destruction of the working class movement.</p>


<h4>Fascism in power loses social base</h4>

<p>The bourgeoisie, which had been scared out of its wits by the
movement of the workers, temporarily gave them some concessions. But
the economic crisis continued. The Italian bourgeoisie, without
reserves, without rich colonies and with a weak economic base, could
not hope to compete with the more powerful bourgeoisie of the Entente
on the world market. Consequently, they were compelled to intensify the
exploitation of the Italian masses on pain of collapse and extinction.</p>

<p>The heroic attempts of the proletariat to find a way out on
the path of the Socialist Revolution had been blocked by the sabotage
of the reformist leadership. The bourgeoisie looked for a solution to
the intolerable crisis in which &quot;law and order&quot; could be established.
The economic crisis was further intensified in the post-war collapse.
The middle class found itself completely ruined and rendered desperate.
Large sections had followed the lead of the workers in supporting the
Socialist Party in the post war revolutionary wave. The core of the
petty-bourgeoisie could have been won with a bold policy on the part of
the proletariat.</p>

<p>But in sheer despair, the petty bourgeoisie began to look for
another solution. It was thus that the fascist movement arose as an
expression of the desperation of the middle class. The big
industrialists financed Mussolini liberally. Fascism began to organize
its bands of crazed petty bourgeois and lumpen proletariat for the
purpose of physically annihilating the leaders and the organizations of
the proletariat. These bands of cutthroats roamed over Italy attacking
workers' co-operatives, unions, Socialist municipalities etc, under the
protection of the bourgeois police. In 1922 Mussolini was placed in
power by the landowners, industrialists, Church and monarchy, as the
sole means of preserving their interests.</p>

 <p>The first
few years of his rule saw him precariously attempting to establish his
domination.</p>

 <p>The murder of Matteotti<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">[1]</a></sup>
provoked a wave of indignation throughout Italy and the working class
only needed a revolutionary lead to overthrow the Fascist regime. Still
the Socialists clung to &quot;legal&quot; methods. Mussolini survived the crisis
and proceeded systematically to destroy the organizations of the
working class. The disillusionment and demoralization of the working
class at the betrayal of their organizations led them to a position of
prostration and apathy. Fascism firmly entrenched itself in power.</p>

<p>But once in power, Fascism begins to lose its middle class
base. The impoverishment and ruin of the petty bourgeoisie is not
halted, but on the contrary, receives a new impetus by the victory of
Fascism. The counter-revolutionary delusions of the petty bourgeoisie
are soon dispelled by the cold reality of the totalitarian state and
the support for Fascism ebbs away. The Fascist regime loses its social
basis completely and becomes an ordinary military-police bureaucratic
dictatorship. That was the position of Mussolini's dictatorship. Yet it
has endured for more than two decades!</p>

 <p>The secret
of the long period of Fascist rule lies not at all in the strength of
the regime, but in world events on the one hand, and, the apathy and
torpor of the Italian masses, who had lost all perspectives with the
betrayal of their organizations. The victory of Hitler, the defeat of
the French and Spanish workers, the further decay and collapse of the
working class movement, the strengthening of reaction on a world scale,
could not but further demoralize and plunge the Italian working class
into gloomy indifference and lack of faith in the future.</p>

 <p>But
the crisis which overshadowed the regime, forced the Italian
bourgeoisie, to attempt outward expansion to save themselves from being
overthrown. The Abyssinian adventure <sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">[2]</a></sup> and the war which
Mussolini waged against the Spanish workers, were symptoms of the
desperation of Italian Fascism. Far from solving anything, they merely
increased the misery of the workers and peasants, and increased the
pressure on the regime. After the fall of France, the Italian
capitalists eagerly seized the opportunity which they imagined had been
presented, to secure a rich Empire on the cheap.</p>

 <p>But
the calculations of the bourgeoisie were completely falsified by
events. Never in history had an army fought with less, morale and less
belief in their cause than the army of Fascist Italy! The coarse
witticisms of the British ruling class against &quot;cowardly&quot; Italians are
completely beside the mark. The Italian army, like that of Czarist
Russia, is composed mainly of peasants. Exploited and oppressed by the
landlords, beaten and tyrannized by the Fascist thugs, their thoughts
of the &quot;enemy&quot; were not against the armies opposing them, but of the
landlords in the villages who lived well by battening on them, while
their women and children hungered and even starved. They thought of the
burdensome taxes to keep up a bloated ignorant fascist militia. They
did not have the will to fight. Mussolini could not even defeat the
Greeks! In Africa the Empire disappeared while the Italian soldiery
surrendered by the tens of thousands with only the semblance of
resistance. Twenty years of Fascism had rotted the regime from top to
bottom. There was not a live element in the whole of its apparatus,
either in the army or the means of suppression at home. Moreover, Italy
as a backward and only semi-industrialized country did not possess the
technique for modern wars as her twin Fascist Germany had the fortune
of possessing in unrivalled technology' and first rate industrial
equipment. All these factors combining, the defeat of Italy became
inevitable.</p>
 
<p>Trotsky, with infallible foresight and
a profound understanding of the masses and of the historical process,
in analyzing the problems of the revolution in the fascist countries
had shown that it would require some sharp shock to rouse the masses
from their lethargy and stupor, to take the road of mass opposition and
mass struggle against the totalitarian regimes; a shock which could be
provided by military defeats or the victory of the revolution in one of
the democracies.</p>

 <p>The defeats of the regime were a
final revelation of its bankruptcy; its corruption and decay provided
the means for the re-awakening of the Italian proletariat. The
molecular process of recovery and revival had been proceeding apace
behind the outward facade of strength and stability of the regime. The
relationship of forces began to change within the country. For the
first time mass strikes had been taking place in the towns against the
unbearable increase in the cost of living, the peasants had begun to
move in a series of minor revolts against the landlords and
the unbearable tax impositions of the Fascist officials, and mutinies
in the army were an ominous indication of the spirits of the troops. As
early as the war against Greece, there were reports of units taken
prisoner, singing the &quot;Bandiera Rossa&quot;. <span class="inote">[The Red Flag - an Italian workers' song]</span></p>


<h4>Only the Trotskyists understood the processes</h4>

<p>The bourgeoisie and the landowners could feel the ground
trembling under their feet. As always in modern society, the approach
of revolution was heralded by tension within all strata of society,
within the ruling class as well as the workers, within the petty
bourgeoisie as well as in the ranks of the fascist bureaucracy and the
state apparatus. The pressure from below produces fissures and
uncertainty, quarrels and differences within the erstwhile solid ranks
of the ruling class. They begin to seek a way out of the impasse, a
means of escaping the rising tide of revolt which threatens to engulf
them. From regarding the &quot;Leader&quot; as their savior from the masses they
begin to regard him as the author of their ills whose &quot;mistakes&quot; have
landed them in an impossible situation. Abuse of the ruler and his
immediate clique of collaborators are replaced by conspiracies and
discussions of a coup d'etat, of a palace revolution, which by a timely
movement from above will prevent and nip in the bud, a movement from
below. The existing relations between the classes have become
unbearable and the situation cannot last. The ruling class seeks for
some means of saving themselves. They cannot reconcile themselves to
the doom which they feel is impending and will overtake them unless
they can forestall it by some means.</p>
 
<p>Thus it was in
Czarist Russia before the February Revolution. Thus it was in Fascist
Italy before the fall of Mussolini. Even a better analogy perhaps, was
the removal of Primo de Rivera, the military dictator in Spain, by
Alfonso in an effort to save the monarchy <sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-3" name="doc-3">[3]</a></sup>. Tomorrow we will
observe the same process in Hitler's Germany. But all these moves in
the ruling class, far from preventing the revolution, dialectically,
are the means of precipitating it. The movement from above produces a
mighty echo in the movement from below. Thus it was that Mussolini was
flung aside by the ruling class in Italy in order to avert their
overthrow. Thus as always in history; they have merely opened the first
chapter in the Revolution.</p>

<p>Whatever the fate of the Italian revolution may be, in
passing, it has dealt the death blow to the cowards and renegades from
the labour movement, ex-&quot;Marxists&quot; such as James Burnham in the United
States and CA Smith in Britain, and the whole tribe of petit bourgeois
intellectuals and sceptics who have regarded the proletariat and the
struggle for socialism with irony and scepticism. This short sighted
professional rabble regarded the outward varnish of fascism as the
development of a new form of society with a new ruling class, neither
bourgeois nor proletarian! To them the inert attitude of the
proletariat in Italy and Germany which bowed its head passively in face
of the Fascist tyranny was proof of the incapacity of the proletariat
and proof of a new society.</p>
 
<p>Incapable of
understanding the dialectics of the development of society, they regard
with irony, condescension and contempt, the strivings of the
proletariat. As in the case of CA Smith this was merely a bridge to
justify desertion to the camp of the bourgeoisie. But they were not
alone. The traitors of Stalinism and the labour bureaucracy, attempted
to justify their own treachery by unloading the blame for the passivity
of the masses onto the &quot;incapacity&quot; of the proletariat and the lack of
ripeness for the Socialist Revolution, which they have put decades
hence. How pitiful is Stalinism, which dissolved the Comintern on the
eve of the fall of Mussolini, how pitiful are the Vansittartistic
labour bureaucracy and Stalinism which unload the blame for Hitler onto
the shoulders of the German proletariat which &quot;tolerates&quot; Hitler. In
reality it is the unending defeats of the past two decades, caused by
the self-same &quot;leaders&quot; and their present policies, which has lain like
a pall over the proletariat of the whole world and produced the mood of
frustration and despair, of demoralization and disintegration, of lack
of belief in itself and its own future. It is this indeed, which has
led to the prolongation of the war and its continuance for four
nightmare years before the first movement of the proletariat. All these
forces and moods were merely the result of the reaction which they
themselves had called forth.</p>
 
<p>Alone of all
tendencies in the labour movement, the Trotskyists maintained faith in
the working class and themselves.</p>

 <p>Even at the
darkest depth of reaction they maintained the banner of International
Socialism, of the International Revolution and retained their faith and
confidence in the proletariat. And this was not accidental either. They
had analyzed and foreseen the reasons for the defeats and understood
the basis of the turn towards reaction and naturally understanding the
causes which did not lay in the proletariat but in the leadership of
the proletariat, they could carry on with the sure confidence given by
an understanding of Marxism. All other tendencies were blind.</p>

<p>They had caused the defeat and were incapable of understanding
the way out of the impasse.</p>

 <p>The crisis in Italy
came to a head with the invasion of Sicily. The unprecedented lack of
support of the regime, was revealed from the fact that even on their
&quot;own&quot; soil the Italian soldiers demonstrated no great eagerness to
fight. Their resistance was ho more energetic and hearty than that on
the shores of Africa across the seas. Despite the exaggerations of
Allied propaganda, it seems clear that the alien invaders were regarded
with no great hostility in Palermo and other towns. Surely a rare
occurrence in history! Anything, anything could not be worse than
Mussolini, was the attitude of the inhabitants of this island. The
regime was so rotten and so loathsome to the broad masses that they did
not regard it as much better than that of a foreign conqueror. To this
catastrophe had Mussolini's braggadocio and bombast reduced Italy! An
emptiness and feeling of terror must have gathered round the hearts of
the ruling class in Italy.</p>
 
<p>The denouement was not
long in coming. In fear of the movement of the masses and realizing
that for Italian Imperialism the war was irretrievably lost, the ruling
class sought to save something from the wreckage. From Germany, already
hard pressed and, facing the virtual certainty of defeat in the future,
they could expect no more aid than would reduce Italy to the status of
France or the satellite Balkan countries even in the event of
problematic victory. And with the certainty that the &quot;democratic&quot;
allies would extract ever greater penalties and tribute in that event.
Mussolini was of no more use to them. They feared the invasion of the
Allies. They feared their mightier &quot;partner&quot;. In frantic panic, trapped
in insuperable contradictions, the ignoble ruling classes of Italy
contemptuously cast Mussolini onto the scrapheap of history.</p>

 <p>But
the bourgeoisie have lost all perspective for the morrow. The monarchy
and the General Staff imagined that they could drop Mussolini and carry
on as before, graciously offering Mussolini's hide to the masses as a
scapegoat for their crimes. Surely Badoglio's proclamation of martial
law will rank in history as the perfect example of the illusions of a
regime which has been condemned by history to destruction. The
dismissal of Mussolini was followed by a declaration of stringent
martial law. But the decree merely remained on paper. Badoglio did not
have the resources to carry it out despite the illusions of the General
Staff.</p>

 <p>The fall of Mussolini acted like an electric
shock to the Italian workers. When the news came over the wireless,
moved by a common impulse, hundreds of thousands rushed into the
streets in the black-out to demonstrate their relief and their joy. The
process that Trotsky had visualized would develop in Italy to mark the
fall of fascism, had begun. (As the news trickled through, one could
not but allow one's thoughts to dwell on the Old Man and to marvel at
his unerring instinct and profound understanding which could develop in
advance almost exactly the stages through which the revolution would
pass.)</p>

<p>After 20 years of fascism the proletariat, now hardened by
terror and persecution, has stepped on to the arena reinvigorated and
fresh, like a giant awakening from a long sleep. Mass strikes in all
the industrial cities, Milan, Turin, Genoa, etc, broke out in 24 hours.
The railways in the whole of Northern Italy were paralyzed within a few
days. The jails were stormed by the workers and the political prisoners
were set free. The fascist headquarters in the large towns have been
sacked and the fascist printing presses, seized by the workers in Milan
and other areas. Anyone wearing the insignia of fascism in Italy on the
day after Mussolini's disappearance stood in danger of being lynched.
Fascism vanished overnight. The belated decree dissolving the fascist
party merely took cognizance of a fact that had already been
irrevocably established by the workers and the soldiers themselves.
Symbolically in Milan, which once again has proudly taken the lead as
&quot;Red Milan&quot;, short shrift was given by the indignant workers to the
murderer of Matteotti. In other areas too, the most hated of the
fascist bosses have been dispatched by the workers. In Turin &quot;two
millionaire fascists&quot; have been executed by the workers. Streets in
Milan have been renamed in honour of Matteotti and other working class
leaders murdered by the fascists. The attempt to use the soldiers
against the demonstrating crowds in Milan has resulted in the soldiers
going over to the side of the workers.</p>


<h4>Reformists and Stalinists prepare betrayal</h4>

<p>Overnight the working class has demonstrated its vitality and
strength as though fascism had never existed. Workers committees have
been set up in the factories in the industrial towns. Even the
Stalinist <em>Daily Worker</em>, following on the news
published in the bourgeoisie press, is compelled to report:</p>

 <p class="quote">&quot;The
radio [Swiss] reported that a Citizens' Committee, consisting of
representatives of industrial workers, soldiers and peasants has been
created in Milan, centre of the industrial north...</p>

 <p class="quote">&quot;A
majority of the troops of the Milan garrison are reported to have sworn
allegiance to the Committee. The banned Communist paper <em>La
Roscossa</em> and the liberal paper <em>La Mundo</em>
were republished on Saturday - produced in former fascist printing
offices.</p>
 
<p class="quote">&quot;Similar moves were reported by the radio
in Turin, Varese, Brescia and Vercelli.</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;In Brescia -
according to the Swiss broadcast-workers have been armed from the army
arsenal and have established a Workers' Militia, which took over the
police authority-with little interference from the police.&quot;</p>
 
<p class="fst">What
are these &quot;Citizens Committees&quot; if not Soviets, which the cowardly and
treacherous Stalinists are afraid to avow at the present time? <em>These
are living proofs that the Italian Revolution has begun.</em></p>

<p>Whatever the vicissitudes of the Italian revolution in the
next period the lie has been given to all the faint hearts and
deserters, to all the cowards and sceptics. The wonderful resilience
and buoyancy, the tremendous powers of recuperation and recovery of the
working class, the only through and through progressive class in modern
society, has been demonstrated. The victories of reaction are shown to
be built on shifting sands. After every defeat, the proletariat
recovers from its wounds and rises again with even greater force to
vanquish the enemy.</p>

 <p>All these events have been
crowded into the short space of a single week! The first stage of the
revolution has seen the whole of industrial Italy on the march. For the
moment the peasants are quiet. It will take some time for the meaning
of the events in the towns to penetrate into the villages. But once he
begins to understand, the peasant will turn against his enemies. The
fall of fascism will be interpreted by him, not only as the fall of the
fascist official but as the beginning of the end for the landlord whom
the officials represent. The peasants will begin, in isolated areas,
sporadically to seize the land. Against the taxes and the landlord!
These will be the rallying cries of the peasants.</p>

 <p>All
the factors that make for the Socialist Revolution in Italy are
crystallizing out. The working class are forming their Soviets and
Workers' Militias. The soldiers (mostly peasants in uniform) are moving
over to the side of the workers. The peasants will move forward. The
middle class in the towns are turning towards the workers for a lead.
All the objective conditions for a socialist revolution are present.
And the taking of power by the Italian workers would instantly provoke
the overthrow of Hitler and inaugurate the Socialist Revolution
throughout Europe. All the conditions? No. The subjective conditions
for the revolution are not yet present. Instinctively and almost
automatically the Italian working class has taken the correct steps on
the road to workers' power. But the Socialists and Stalinists are
already preparing to betray the movement by turning it into the
channels of bourgeois &quot;democracy&quot;.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, the
&quot;Allies&quot; regard with not unmixed feelings the developments in Italy.
Churchill's speech is a revelation of the fears and forebodings of the
ruling class in the face of the revolution. His reference to, the
difficulty of conquering a country mile by mile and the necessity to
avoid rule through concentration camps and firing squads does not come
from any tenderness towards the Italian workers but of fear of such
measures. The old fox of the ruling class remembers with dread the
fiasco of intervention against the Russian Revolution after the last
war. He wishes if possible, to avoid the same experience again. The
ruling class is preparing a deal with the monarchy and the possessing
classes in Italy. They hope, by a military occupation to nip the
revolution in the bud before it has time to develop.</p>

 <p>Whatever
the developments in the next period, even if the military events should
move more swiftly than the political developments in the Italian
peninsula, Europe and the world will never be the same again. The fall
of Mussolini is merely the rehearsal for the fall of Hitler. The news
reports from Switzerland state that Mussolini's fall was greeted by
demonstrations of the Italian workers in Berlin who burned pictures of
Mussolini and all the symbols of fascism on bonfires. And what is
important was the reaction of the German workers. In the factories
which employed the Italians, they solidarised with them and joined the
demonstrations, adding to the bonfires, portraits of Hitler and the
Nazi flag. The police took no active steps against them. This is just a
symptom of the situation in Germany which must break out in revolution.</p>

<p>But it is not only a question of Germany. The whole of
European society has developed explosive potentialities during the war.
The contradictions which have been piling up for more than two decades
have reached their extreme limit; it requires merely one or two more
sharp shocks to set the contradictions detonating in revolution. The
news of Mussolini's fall immediately had its repercussions throughout
Europe. Tremendous strikes have been announced in Portugal. Franco held
emergency meetings of his cabinet as he felt the ground under his feet
shake. Boris of Bulgaria waited fearfully to see if the revolts would
begin. The Balkan countries are rotten-ripe for revolution. But it is
not a question of this or that country. It is the whole continent of
Europe that waits only for sonic beginning to burst forth in revolt
from end to end.</p>
 
<p>The swaying fortunes of the war
have produced the fantastic situation when with the defeat of Germany,
there will not he a single belligerent country in Europe which to all
practical purposes, will not he defeated. In 1918 the ruling class
precariously balanced the smaller powers in the Balkans against one
another. Though shaky, the Italian army, and the French especially,
remained props of &quot;law and order&quot;, which could offset the countries in
which revolution broke out. Today Giraud in north Africa and the Turks
are being built as armies of counter-revolution. But these are weak
reeds to lean on. With the collapse of the Nazi armies, there will not
be a single army in Europe upon which the imperialists can rely for the
purposes of counter-revolution. It is out of the question that the Red
Army could be used for this purpose. Indeed the coming revolution in
the West would be the beginning of the end for Stalin and the
bureaucracy. It could mean the beginning of the political revolution in
Russia as well. To smash the revolution the British army would not be a
reliable instrument, but would be liable to crack in the process. Only
American imperialism has a fairly stable base and a backward army on
which to rely. But for how long in the red-hot atmosphere of Europe?
The American army would also disintegrate and decompose. We are on the
verge of a revolutionary wave in Europe which will last for years and
which will affect the whole world by its grandiose sweep.</p>


<h4>'Spanish' warning to Italian workers</h4>

<p>It is on this background that the situation in Italy must be
viewed. Even in the worst event-that of defeat of the revolution and
military occupation, this is but the first uprising in Europe. An
Allied or a German occupation of Italy might temporarily smash the
movement. But to invade in a war and to intervene against a revolution
are two different tasks. The Stalinists and Social-democrats will
attempt to guide the movement into Popular Front channels in the
interests of Allied imperialism. The Spanish tragedy is the warning of
where such policies will lead the Italian working class.</p>
 
<p>The
Italian masses have placed themselves at the head of the revolutionary
upsurge of all Europe. The honour which fell to the Russian proletariat
in the last war falls to them today. But Russia had a Bolshevik Party
and a Bolshevik leadership. This alone guaranteed victory. It will be
the task of the advanced workers in Italy to forge such a party in the
fire of events. Tens of thousands of the heroic militants who continued
the struggle against fascism despite everything are really Trotskyists,
though the majority may never have heard that name. They will find the
way to the program of International Socialism.</p>
 
<p>With
the fresh breeze of the revolution blowing from across the
Mediterranean, a new enthusiasm and a new resolve must pervade the
activities of the advanced workers in Britain. Our tasks are
complicated. Britain is one of the keys if not the key, to the
revolution in Europe. The main task of the revolutionaries now consists
in aiding the Italian workers by fighting against intervention against
the revolution in Italy. To read the press of vile Stalinism on the
Italian situation cannot but arouse a sense of disgust in any conscious
Socialist worker. Against these traitors! For the revolution in Italy!
No intervention by British Imperialism must be the rallying cry for the
working class.</p>
