Nationalisation becomes a key issue
with the aim of the Tories to de-nationalise key sectors, or rather very
profitable sectors under state ownership. Thus big business in the electronics
industry is eagerly eyeing the telecommunications section of the Post Office.
This is making big profits and is regarded as a growth industry of the future.
Consequently they would like to hive it off for the benefit of the monopolies.
Of course the postal services which make a loss they will generously leave to
the state! Now the government is suggesting the de-nationalisation of Cooks,
the travel agents, which is a subsidiary of the railways and makes a profit of
over &pound;1 million a year.
</p>
<p>
The government is trying to hand
over lucrative routes of BOAC and BEA airways now that they have become
profitable. Routes making &pound;6 million a year are to be handed over to the former
bankrupt Caledonian Airways and the concern which under these conditions would
be willing graciously to take it over. &pound;6 million and not a penny in
compensation to the state! That is the attitude of the Tory government whose
members are always screaming about &ldquo;fair compensation&rdquo; to vested interests.
</p>
<p>
The reason for this looting of the
state was explained by the &ldquo;Committee on Civil Aviation&rdquo; under professor Sir
Ronald Edwards which found 
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;&hellip;that the Air Corporations had a fairly creditable
record, though this did not prevent it from going on to advocate that part of
their operations should be handed over to private operators without
compensation, so important was it to foster private enterprise&rdquo; (<i>British air transport in the seventies</i>).
</p>
<p class="fst">
Thus under a previous Tory
government road transport which was profitable was hived off, leaving the
unprofitable railways in the hands of the state. Steel too when making a profit
was de-nationalised. The Labour government&rsquo;s re-nationalisation put further
profits in their pockets by over-compensation.
</p>
<p>
These examples show how the tycoons
are always on the lookout for further profits at the expense of the state. Thus
two thirds of research and development in industry is paid for by the state.
Private industry reaps the benefit without shelling out a single penny!
</p>
<h4>Nationalised
industry more efficient</h4>
<p class="fst">
At the same time the capitalist
press and the mass media generally carry on an insidious campaign against
nationalised industry picturing them as inefficient and an immense burden on
the economy and on the people. Thus price rises of coal, electricity, gas or
transport are headlined, though private industry has increased its prices much
more in proportion since the war. This gets no mention in the &ldquo;popular&rdquo; press.
A campaign which has lasted more than a quarter of a century has had some
effects, especially on the more uncritical and unthinking sections of the
population, particularly middle class people and the more politically backward
section of the workers who vote for their class enemy, the Conservatives.
</p>
<p>
The facts show, however, that in
spite of inefficiency, red tape, and bureaucratism inevitable in the large
scale industries which have been nationalised where there is no participation
and control by the workers in the industry, or general workers&rsquo; management by
the trade unions as a whole, which would be a really socialist form of
nationalisation: nevertheless state ownership is more efficient than private
industry. &ldquo;Private&rdquo;&mdash;in reality monopoly&mdash;big business has all the faults,
sometimes in worse measure of state industry, without its virtues. There is no
public accountability for the monopolies and their inefficiencies and even
gross mismanagement are concealed by the press. Their anti-social aspects and
their lust for profits at the expense of the economy and of the workers are not
publicised.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the myth of the
inefficiency of state ownership in comparison with private enterprise has crept
even into the ranks of active trade unionists and Labour Party members in the
constituency organisations. The responsibility for this must rest with the
Labour leadership which has not conducted a regular and systematic campaign
giving the facts to the membership and to the working class as a whole.
</p>
<p>
Now professor R. W. S. Pryke has
given some of the facts in the <i>Moorgate
and Wall Street </i>journal of Spring 1970, a journal hardly read by the mass
of the population!
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Between
1958 and 1968 output per man-hour rose by nearly 2.5 times in the Air
Corporation&hellip;Electricity 114 percent&hellip;gas output per man hour rose by 71
percent&hellip;In British road services by 62 percent, in coal by 57 percent and
railways by 52 percent&hellip;&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
The overall rise of the nationalised industries
was two-thirds.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;Productivity of all the public sector heavyweights
has increased much faster since 1948, and especially since 1958, than it did
between the wars. In gas, output per man-year <i>was no higher in 1935 than it had been in 1924</i>. On the railways,
productivity increased by 1.2 percent per annum between 1924 and 1935 compared
with a rise of 2.3 percent between 1948 and 1958, and of 4.3 percent between
1958 and 1968. Coal increased 1.9 percent per man-shift between 1934 and 1938.
Between 1948 and 1968 3.1 percent; a 5 percent average between 1958 and 1968.
Electricity between 1924 and 1935 output per man rose 5.5 percent per annum. Between
1948 and 1958 6.2 percent. Between 1958 and 1968 7.9 percent.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">
&ldquo;During the second decade of nationalisation,
however, output per man-hour increased considerably faster within the public
enterprise sector than in manufacturing. Between 1958 and 1968 the nationalised
industries productivity rose by 5.3 percent each year compared with 3.7 percent
in manufacturing, which means that the public enterprise rate was about 40
percent faster.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="fst">
Imagine if the figures were reversed
the big headlines there would be in the <i>Beaverbrook</i>,
<i>Rothermere</i> and other kept organs of
the millionaire press. It is up to the advanced workers in the labour movement
to conduct a campaign of mass education explaining the real facts to the
working class and to the people generally, to support the resistance of the
airport workers to any extension of de-nationalisation, to fight for the
extension of nationalisation to the profitable industries and not only to the
industries ruined by big business.
