Now events across the North Sea areshowing how false is this idea. Symptomatic of thewinds of change blowing in Hollandhas been the crisis in the Catholic Church, which has involved even theBishops. This is an indication of the mood developing among the working-classand among the people. Before that we had the crisis of the youth and thedevelopment of the Dutch &#8220;Provos&#8221;. This was a symptom of themovement of opinion within the working-class, but with the tactics and anticsof the elements leading it, it could only lead itself into the sand withoutshowing any way forward.</p><p>TheDutch Labour Party was one of the most right-wing, if not the most right-wing,party in Europe. But on the 17<sup>th</sup>February, a quarter of the Parliamentary Party voted for a motion demandingthat the government recognise NorthVietnam. This is not to say that many of theparliamentarians have changed their views, but it is an indication of the realtrend of events.</p><p>Theleft has waged a struggle, gaining greater and greater support, for the pasttwo and a half years within the Dutch Labour Party. At the congress before thelast, they had already gained almost half the seats on the National Executive. According to a report in <em>TheEconomist</em> of February 21<sup>st</sup>, at the last congress in January the&#8220;traditional Marxists&#8221; gained a majority of the party organisation.While not really Marxist, they reflect the rank and file, trying to find theroad to a militant socialist policy.</p><p>Theright-wing leadership in parliament, like Gaitskell in the past, are trying to&#8220;fight, fight, and fight again&#8221; against the decisions of the conference, butthese right-wingers are finding it difficult in local organisations of theparty. The right-wing officials and local councillors are in many casesdeserting the struggle and resigning their seats on the councils, and in theparty, because of the demands of the majority for socialist policies andleft-wing ideas.</p><p>Nowthe right wing is preparing to split. A group of extreme right-wingers havegathered together to found a new party, calling itself &#8220;Democrat Socialist1970&#8221;.</p><p>As<em>The Economist</em> sadly comments, in amatter of months the party will be split into two parts: a &#8220;moderate rump&#8221; andan &#8220;extreme left wing&#8221;. The futility of these faint-hearts, who deserted thestruggle for a Marxist policy in the Social Democrats, who conduct a barren&#8220;independent&#8221; policy&#8212;independent of the movement of the working class&#8212;is shownby these events.</p><p>Thishas many lessons for the movement in Britain. There have been manysectarians who deserted the struggle for a socialist policy within the labourmovement. In their various bizarre guises, they imagined they would build amovement outside the real developments among the masses. On the other hand,many sincere students and leftists also moved away because they said theworkers had left the Labour Party, forgetting that more than any other party inthe world, resting on the trade unions, the Labour Party is the mass party ofthe working class. When the workers move left it will have its effect also onthe Labour Party. The radicalised white-collar and the industrial workers havebeen exerting pressure and fighting for higher wages in recent months. Theorganised Labour Movement forced a withdrawal of anti-trade union legislation.That is the harbinger of the future; at the moment the main concern of theorganised workers, with a general election looming, is the fight againstconservatism and capitalist reaction.</p><p>Thepessimism in the circles around <em>Tribune</em>arises from the lack of Marxist analysis and Marxist perspectives for thefuture. It is the other side of the coin of the despairing middle-class anddeclassed elements who have left the Labour Party. Holland only shows a rehearsal of developments in Britain. Fortheir right-wing liberal ideas there is no future. The trade union and labourmovement will move left. The ideas of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky will find theirreflection within the labour movement in the coming years.</p><p class="skip">&nbsp;</p><hr class="end" /><p class="footer"><a href="../../index.htm">Ted GrantArchive</a></p></body></html>
