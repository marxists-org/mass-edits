<p class="fst">World War Two ended in a complex and entirely unforeseen relationship of
forces between the nations and between the classes. It ended in the victory of
two continental powers on the world arena, US imperialism and the Russian
bureaucracy. That became the dominant factor on a world scale: the division of
the world between two competing blocs. For the first time in history the great
powers of Europe were reduced to secondary positions; France, Germany, Italy,
were defeated and England became a second rate power. Japan was reduced to the
status of an occupied territory stripped of all her colonies and spheres of
influence. The struggle between the classes can only be understood against a
background of this decisive conflict of the era.</p>

<p>The decay of capitalism was reflected above all in the weakening of
imperialism and the upsurge of the masses in Asia, with the revolutionary wave
in Western and Eastern Europe. The upsurge of the masses in Asia in the struggle
for national liberation was such as to compel the British to withdraw from
India, Burma and Ceylon (Sri Lanka - Ed) and enter into a different relationship
with the national bourgeoisie of these countries.</p>

<p>Dutch imperialism has been compelled to withdraw from Indonesia and arrive at
a compromise with the native ruling class. In Indo-China French imperialism has
been bogged down ever since the war in its desperate effort to hold down the
national liberation struggle. In Malaya, British imperialism with all the
resources at its disposal has not been enabled to defeat the Malayan peoples'
fight for independence. In China American imperialism has sustained an
unparalleled reverse. Despite the lavish pouring of munitions and supplies to
the aid of the decrepit Chiang Kai Shek regime, the forces of Chinese
landlordism-capitalism-imperialism, as represented by the corrupt Kuomintang<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-1" name="doc-1">(1)</a></sup>
clique, have been pushed into the sea and retain but a shaky foot-hold on the
island of Formosa (Taiwan - Ed), protected only by the sea and now the American
navy.</p>

<p>Korea divided into Russian and American spheres of influence, reveals the
weakness of imperialism in the whole of the Far East. Without the direct
intervention of American imperialism the Korean Chiang Kai Shek would have
collapsed as ignominiously as the Chiang regime itself. At best American
imperialism will be enabled to retain a foothold after a lengthy struggle and
American forces will be pinned down like those of the French in Indo-China and
the British in Malaya, even in the event of a complete victory in the South.
This is the measure of the decay of the old relations of capitalism and
imperialism of the past. Capitalism rots at its weakest point.</p>

<p>In Europe, the victory of Russia in the war and the upsurge of the masses
following the defeat of German-Italian fascism also developed a tremendous
revolutionary wave which threatened to sweep capitalism away over the entire
continent. However, the victory of Russia in the war had complex and
contradictory consequences. Temporarily, but nevertheless for an entire
historical period, Stalinism has been enormously strengthened. Despite the
destruction and blood letting to which Russia had been subjected, which left her
in an exhausted and weak state (while Anglo-American imperialism had hardly been
touched during the war and suffered negligible losses in resources and manpower
- America had reached the apex of her power militarily and economically),
because of the mood of the peoples and the relationship of class forces on a
world scale, the imperialists were impotent to intervene against Russia.</p>

<p>Intervention even on a scale following that of World War I was impossible. On
the contrary, the allies were forced to swallow the Russian hegemony of Eastern
Europe and parts of Asia which they would never have agreed to concede even to
reactionary Czarism. The Russian bureaucracy had achieved the domination of the
region beyond the wildest dreams of Russia under the Czars.</p>

<p>The process whereby capitalism was overthrown in Eastern Europe and Stalinism
extended, took place in a peculiar way. The vacuum in the state power in Eastern
Europe, following the defeat of the Nazis and their Quislings, was filled by the
forces of the conquering Red Army. The weak bourgeoisie of these areas had been
largely exterminated, absorbed as Quislings to German imperialism or reduced to
minor partners of the Nazis during the years of the war. They had been
relatively weak in Eastern Europe even before the war, as the states of this
region were largely semi-colonies of the great powers on the lines of the South
American states. The pre-war regimes suffered from a chronic crisis due to the
Balkanisation<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-2" name="doc-2">(2)</a></sup> of the area and the incapacity of the
ruling class to solve the problems of even the bourgeois democratic revolution.
They were nearly all military police dictatorships of a weak character without
any real roots among the masses.</p>

<p>The victory of Russia during the war undoubtedly provoked an upsurge among
the masses either rapidly or in some countries delayed for a time. The socialist
revolution was on the order of the day. This was dangerous not only for the
bourgeoisie but also the Stalinist bureaucracy. The bureaucracy achieved their
aims by skilfully veering between and manipulating the classes in typical
Bonapartist fashion. The trick was to form a 'popular front' between the classes
and to organise a government of 'national concentration'. However this 'popular
front' had a different base and different aims in view than the 'popular fronts'
of the past.</p>

<p>In Spain the aim of the 'popular front' was to destroy the powers of the
workers and the embryonic workers' state, by destroying the workers' revolution.
This was achieved by making an alliance with the bourgeoisie, or rather the
shadow of the bourgeoisie, strangling the control which the workers had
established in the factories and the armed workers' militia and re-establishing
the capitalist state under the control of the bourgeoisie. As a consequence of
this policy towards the end of the war there was a military police dictatorship
on both sides of the lines.</p>

<p>The aim of the coalition with the broken bourgeoisie or its shadow in Eastern
Europe had different objectives than that of handing control back to the
capitalist class. In previous 'popular fronts' the real power of a state - armed
bodies of men, police and the state apparatus - was firmly in the hands of the
bourgeoisie with the workers' parties as appendages. In Eastern Europe, with one
important variation or another, <em>the real power ie control of the armed bodies
of men and the state apparatus, was in the hands of the Stalinists. </em>The
bourgeoisie occupied the position of appendage without the real power. Why then
the coalition? It served as a cover under which a firm state machine on the
model of that of Moscow could be constructed and consolidated.</p>

<p>The bourgeoisie was utilised by the bureaucracy in order to prevent the
workers, awakened by the victory of the Red Army and the events of the war, from
achieving the socialist revolution on the lines of October. The bureaucracy
played off the bourgeoisie in the name of unity against the working class. They
manipulated with Bonapartist manoeuvres the groping aspirations of the workers
to establish control of the factories.</p>

<p>By introducing land reform and expropriating the landlord class, they secured
for the time being the support or acquiescence of the peasants. Having
consolidated and built up a <em>strong state under their control </em>they then
proceeded to the next stage. Mobilising the workers, they turned on the
bourgeoisie, whom they no longer required, to balance against the workers and
peasants, and step by step they proceeded to their expropriation. The
bourgeoisie without the support of outside imperialism was incapable of decisive
resistance. A totalitarian regime approximating more and more to the Moscow
model has been gradually introduced. After the elimination of the bourgeoisie,
and the beginning of a large scale industrialisation the bureaucracy has turned
against the peasants and started on the road of the collectivisation of
agriculture.</p>


<h4>The Case of Yugoslavia</h4>

<p>In Yugoslavia and China the pattern of events was somewhat different,
although not fundamentally so, from developments in Eastern Europe. After the
subjugating of Yugoslavia by the forces of German imperialism a struggle for
national liberation against the foreign oppressor began to develop. This had a
wide base due to the traditions of Yugoslavia and the struggles of its peoples
against Turkish domination and that of Austria-Hungary before the First World
War.</p>

<p>This resulted in a peasant war and a guerrilla struggle in the mountains.
Under 'normal' conditions such a struggle could only have ended in the victory
of the bourgeoisie and the possibility of land reform, even if carried to a
successful conclusion. But the dominating factors of our epoch lie in the
victory of 'October' and the distortion of the revolution by the bureaucracy. On
the one hand the background of a strong 'workers' state' (even though in a
degenerated form) and on the other the frightful decay of capitalism-imperialism
on a world scale and the incapacity of the local bourgeoisie to solve a single
one of the national or democratic problems facing the country, served to push
the masses in the direction of the socialist revolution. Again, the distortion
of the revolution results in a curious deformation of the struggle on the part
of the local agencies of Stalinism.</p>

<p>The peasants cannot play an independent role. They must follow one or another
of the basic classes in modern society. In contradistinction to the classical
Marxist theory of the past, the struggle began with small sections of the
workers and Stalinist leadership taking to the hills and organising the peasants
in a war for national liberation. The overwhelming majority of the rank and file
of the partisan army of liberation was composed of peasants. Its rank and file
of the partisan army of liberation was composed of peasants. Its nature revealed
itself in the civil war, which began even under the occupation, with
Mihailovitch<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-3" name="doc-3">(3)</a></sup> representing the capitalist and upper
middle class (or rather those remnants who had not sold out completely to German
imperialism). The Bonapartist bureaucracy, basing itself on the peasants, led
the struggle under the guise of a national 'popular front' similar to those
later established in Eastern Europe. Apart from the big cities large areas were
under the control of Tito towards the end of the war, though the assistance of
the Red Army was necessary for the conquest of Belgrade.</p>

<p>However events in Yugoslavia developed on a different pattern to those in
Eastern Europe. In the other countries of Eastern Europe the partisan struggles
were in most cases either weak, almost non-existent or in an embryonic stage
when the Red Army arrived. In those where a mass of resistance did occur, there
were special circumstances which did not exist in Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>The important difference between Yugoslavia (as with China) and the rest of
Eastern Europe lies in the fact that Tito and the Yugoslav Stalinists had
established an independent state base before the arrival of the Red Army. They
had the support of the big majority of the masses in the revolutionary struggle
which they had undertaken. Thus the attempt of the Russian bureaucracy to
establish firm control could be met with successful resistance on the part of
the Yugoslavs. They were not so dependent on Moscow as were the other satellite
parties.</p>

<p>In the Soviet Union itself conflicts inevitably arose between the national
republics and the Stalinist bureaucracy because of the Great Russian tendencies
of centralisation and bureaucratic oppression in the interests of the Moscow
clique. In the Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, German-Volga Republic, opposition
against the national oppression developed in all the republics of Russia against
this stifling economic and cultural oppression. In the Ukraine, particularly,
oppression developed to such an extent that Trotsky raised the slogan of an
independent Socialist Soviet Ukraine. The opposition of the masses of the
republic was such that the hand-picked Stalinist leadership had to be purged and
killed in order to consolidate the rule of the bureaucracy.</p>

<p>To this day the national question remains a key question in the struggle
against the bureaucracy. Thus Stalin's tendency to convert Eastern Europe into a
fief for the benefit of the Russian bureaucracy through privileged and
extortionate agreements and the subordination of the interests of the economy in
these countries to the economic needs of the Moscow bureaucracy was bound to
awaken opposition amongst the masses, which had to arouse an echo even in the
dominant Stalinist parties. It was in this soil that the break between the
Moscow Stalinist regime and the Yugoslav Stalinist regime had to take place. It
was on this issue that the Yugoslav bureaucracy, because of its independent
state base and its mass support, could successfully defy the Kremlin.</p>

<p>Even against the cruel Cominform blockade, paradoxically because of the
tension between East and West, they could succeed in maintaining a precarious
balance. It is the national question which explains the basis of the Yugoslav
resistance. The Yugoslav bureaucracy wished to preserve the position of a
smaller partner rather than be a puppet state of Moscow. Where the Ukrainian and
Georgian bureaucrats could not succeed, they had the possibility.</p>

<p>In the other states of Eastern Europe the opposition was dealt with on
similar lines to that of the opposition in the national states within the Soviet
Union. The leading elements such as Gomulka<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-4" name="doc-4">(4)</a></sup>, Rajk,
Kostov were executed or jailed and the state machine purged from top to bottom
to bring it into line as an obedient tool of Moscow. The attempt in Yugoslavia,
however, ended with the arrest and imprisonment of the Moscow Stalinist agents
Zujobic and Hebrang.</p>

<p>Does the break of Tito with Stalin mean that the Yugoslav regime ceases to be
Stalinist? The regime remains that of a Yugoslav variant of Russian Stalinism.
Stalinism means a totalitarian regime with a privileged bureaucratic caste
superimposed on the economic base of the workers' state. With this or that
difference, with this or that modification, nevertheless the regime in
Yugoslavia resembles that of Russia, just as the Dollfus regime in little
Austria resembled that of Hitler and Mussolini.</p>

<p>In the same way as it is possible for there to be varying fascist regimes in
different countries, so under given conditions there can be various Stalinist
regimes, various democratic bourgeois states and various forms of workers'
states conforming to the norm.</p>

<p>The decisive considerations in our characterisation of a regime are: firstly,
the basic social characteristicsworkers' state, capitalist state, feudal
state, slave state, etc. Secondly, though still of vital importance, its
political super-structure. In the case of capitalist statesfascist,
democratic, imperialist, colonial etc in the case of a workers'
statebureaucratised or workers' democracy. On this basis Yugoslavia remains a
deformed workers' state. [Marxists support the struggle of the Yugoslav masses
against the] chauvinist national oppression of the Russian bureaucracy, just as
we as we support the struggle of the Ukraine or of Poland for freedom from the
domination of Moscow.</p>

<p>In Yugoslavia itself the Fourth International must fight for the overthrow of
the Yugoslav bureaucracy by means of a political revolution. The demands of this
political revolution will be for the control to be placed in the hands of the
masses through a regime of workers' democracy, with as a minimum, the right to
participate freely in all political life for all working class tendencies,
elimination of the privileges of the bureaucracy, restoration of the right to
strike, etc.</p>

<p>The Yugoslav regime in its outlook and methods remains more on the path of
Stalinism than that of revolutionary Marxism. The pressure from Stalinism
compels the Yugoslav bureaucracy to borrow extensively from the Marxist
criticism of Stalin. Verbal gestures to the left no more transform the regime to
that of a healthy workers' state than the sometimes correct Stalinist criticism
of reformism and capitalism turns it (the Stalinist bureaucracy) into a genuine
Marxist current. In a similar sense to that in which Stalinism remains a
centrist current so also does the Yugoslav bureaucracy.</p>

<p>This bureaucracy is fresher than that of Moscow. It probably has a greater
mass support among the toilers. The Five Year Plan, like that of Russia in its
early stages, has evoked the enthusiastic support of the masses who believe that
they are building socialism. Nevertheless, already the differentiation is as
great as it was in Russia in the early years of the Five Year Plan. The basic
physiognomy of the ruling clique is indicated by the fact that they have
remained wedded to the theory of socialism in one country - albeit on a lower
level, on the basis of tiny Yugoslavia, in comparison with the tremendous
resources of Russia.</p>

<p>The Utopian position of the Yugoslavs, hemmed in by the hatred of the
bureaucracy in the East and capitalism-imperialism in the West; precariously
blancing on this antagonism in order to maintain themselves, is shown by the
first skirmishes in the struggle between the USA and the USSR. The pathetic
capitulation to Western imperialism involved in the demand for the mediation of
the United Nations in Korea, is the best indication of the non-Marxist character
of the Yugoslav bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Not basing themselves on internationalism, like other small nations, they can
only scurry backwards and forwards between the mighty powers of Russia and
America, without the possibility of an independent role. Only an
internationalist position would save them from the ignominous role which
Yugoslavia plays in the United Nations (UN).</p>

<p>Zig-zags to the left, like the Stalinist zig-zags to the left - in words -
cannot alter the fundamental relationships in Yugoslavia. The economic base of
Yugoslavia - a backward country not much more developed than Russia before its
industrialisation - brings forth the inexorable consequences of the
bureaucratisation which developed in Moscow.</p>

<p>With convulsive swings to the right and left, the economic tendency, given
the same causes, would have the same effect. The Yugoslav regime will more and
more approach that of Moscow.</p>


<h4>Stalinism in China</h4>

<p>The peculiar combination of forces which resulted in the victory of Stalinism
in Eastern Europe, are working towards the same results in Asia. In China, we
have an outstanding example of this result of the multiplicity of hisorical
factors. The defeat of the revolution of 1925-7 (due to the mistakes of the
Stalinists) which had had every promise of success, led the Stalinist leadership
and the cadres they had managed to retain, to desert the cities and take to the
mountains in order to base themselves on the peasant war - a war which had many
precedents in China's long history.<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-5" name="doc-5">(5)</a></sup></p>

<p>The crumbling and decay of the capitalist-landlord military police regime was
shown in its total incapacity to solve a single one of China's problems in the
period 1924-45. Far more rotten than Czarist Russia, even at its worst, it
succeeded in alienating almost the entire population apart from the tiny clique
of Chiang Kai Shek at the top.</p>

<p>There were none really willing to strike a blow in defence at the hour of
danger. In the same period the frightful decay of imperialism following the
Second World War made the imperialists incapable of intervening. In 1925-7
British imperialism had replied to an 'insult to the Flag' by bombarding the
main ports of China with their warships. This with the approval of the labour
and trade union leaders. In 1949 such was the relationship of forces, the
imperialists hailed with glee the sneaking away of the warship <em>Amethyst</em>
from the waters of the Yangtze! So has the relationship of forces changed. The
American imperialists intervened with huge supplies of arms, money and
munitions, to aid the corrupt gang of Chiang Kai Shek, almost invariably the
supplies falling into the hands of the Chinese Red Army.</p>

<p>These factors, together with the fact that they had mighty Russia as a
neighbour, all had their impact on the development of the Situation in China.
Under 'normal' conditions the peasant war in China would have ended as all such
wars have ended in the past, or the leadership of the Chinese peasants would
have fused with the capitalist elements in the cities and the peasant masses
would have found themselves betrayed. The revolution would have assumed a
capitalist character.</p>

<p>However, all the factors enumerated above had to have a different result than
could have been foreseen in advance. Without Russia as a neighbour, without the
degeneration of the Russian regime as a further factor, without the complete
breakdown of the regime in China, where the old ruling class had so pitifully
outlived itself, without the degeneration of the international Stalinist
movement, without the extreme weakness of the genuine Marxist current, without
the weakness of imperialism on a world scale, events in China as in all Asia
would have taken a different turn: either in the direction of a proletarian
revolution according to the norm (with all its international implications in the
spreading of the revolution in Europe and the world) or the victory of
capitalist counter-revolution. Those would have been the alternatives.</p>

<p>History, however, is full of inexhaustible variants which cannot be foreseen
in advance. Theory is grey, but the tree of life is green. All these
complicated factors in combination have resulted in the revolution being
accomplished in a different way than theory had previously indicated. Using the
same technique as in Yugoslavia, with the mass movement of the peasants as their
base, Mao and the Chinese Red Army (with possibly an even more popular and
greater mass base than Tito had) waged a revolutionary war for the land. The
armies of the Kuomintang clique melted away. Here was a peasant war in the
classical revolutionary tradition. The Bonapartist clique of Stalinism based
itself firmly on the longing of the peasantry for the land. Leading the peasant
war they gained the powerful support of the masses. Here we have a peculiar
variation of the permanent revolution [where a victorious peasant army was led
by] ex-Marxists.</p>

<p>Due to the crisis of the regime and the paralysis of the movements in the
cities by Stalinism, Mao Tse Tung and the other Stalinist leaders established an
independent base in the peasant army; the classical instrument of Bonapartism.
But in line with the epoch and the various factors already exhaustively dealt
with it could not end as normally a peasant war independent of the mass movement
in the cities would end. Having conquered the cities, with at least the passive
acquiescence of the working class and urban petty bourgeois masses, Mao Tse Tung
and his group could succeed in Bonapartist fashion in balancing between the
classes.</p>

<p>Starting with the gradual elimination of the landlords throughout the
territory which they had conquered (after the initial stages of the movement the
bureaucracy was concerned not to have any independent movement of either the
peasants or the workers which could not be directly harnessed and controlled by
themselves), and immediately confiscating what they termed 'bureaucratic
capitalism' ie the key centres of whatever heavy industry and finance existed,
the Bonapartist bureaucracy could manoeuvre between the classes. For a temporary
period and in order to help consolidate the rise and control of the bureaucratic
caste, they have tolerated merchant and industrial capitalism in a neo-NEP<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-6" name="doc-6">(6)</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Manoeuvring between the classes, they will establish a firm and strong state
machine. Basing themselves now on the peasants, now on the workers, then on the
bourgeoisie, to serve different ends they will balance between them as 'arbiter'
and regulator of the relations between the classes. Inevitably they will move on
to the confiscation of private ownership in industry and then at a later stage,
to the expropriation of the peasantry as well, on the model of Russia and
Eastern Europe. Because of the weakness and impotence of the bourgeoisie, with
no historical perspective and no historical mission to perform, it will be
eliminated with comparative ease. Mao will base himself on the workers in order
to strike blows at the bourgeoisie, as Stalin did at the time of the elimination
of the Kulaks and the 'nepmen'.</p>

<p>A Stalinist bureaucracy cannot tolerate the sharing of power with the
bourgeoisie because this would weaken it and reduce it to a subordinate puppet
role, with the corresponding diminution of income, power and privileges. The
peasants, incapable of finding a different road, will be mercilessly repressed.
Gradually a totalitarian State, more and more approximating to that of Moscow,
will be established. Having based themselves on the workers for a time in order
to eliminate the capitalists and consolidate their rule, they must turn on the
working class and smash any elements of workers' democracy which may exist or be
developed in the process.</p>

<p>Before Stalinism in China is a long perspective of power despite the social
convulsions and crises of growth and consolidation. It is relatively progressive
because of the development of industry and the unification of China for the
first time and on this basis giving a tremendous impulse to the development of
the productive forces. Purely on the basis of Chinese conditions they can
maintain their rule for a long time. They will consolidate themselves more and
more firmly in control in the next period. Factors making for this have been the
endless war and civil war in which China has been involved in the last two
decades, the weariness of the people who demand peace, the relatively
progressive role they play in China, and the lack of any alternative on the
Chinese basis alone. All these factors strengthen powerfully the role of Chinese
Stalinism.</p>

<p>Of course, events in China can be hastened or retarded by developments in
Western Europe, America and Russia. These remain the decisive areas of the
world. A successful proletarian revolution in the West producing a workers'
state on the Marxist norm, would, of course, result in a revival of the
revolution in China and open the road for a healthy development by hastening the
political revolution. But taking Chinese forces as a basis it is clear that Mao,
like Stalin, will develop the forces which will overthrow his machine in the
future.</p>

<p>The relatively austere administration, without control from the masses, will
become more and more corrupt. State power is a powerful source of infection and
disease. Increasing their separation from the masses, the bureaucratic caste
will raise themselves higher and higher above the people as a new aristocracy
and will provoke the sharp hatred of the masses.</p>

<p>Because of the history of China, its traditions and its terrible
backwardness, Chinese Stalinism with its own forces alone will inevitably
develop an even more monstrous oppressive machine than that of Stalinism in
Russia. The bureaucratic caste which is crystallising there will only be removed
by force. The new political revolution will lead to the establishment of a
healthy workers' democracy but on a higher industrial foundation. In the long
run the fate of China, as of all the East will be determined by the fate of the
revolution in Eastern Europe and America.</p>

<p>Having an independent base, the regime of Mao Tse Tung will most likely come
into conflict with that of the Stalinist bureaucracy in Russia. Reluctantly,
after the experience of Yugoslavia, the bureaucracy has been compelled to treat
the People's Republic of China as a junior partner rather than an out and out
satellite or a Moscow province. Despite the efforts to avoid this, at a later
stage if favourable terms can be obtained from Britain and America, it is quite
likely that Mao Tse Tung will break away and play an independent role. Thus, in
that sense, once an independent basis is established, it is difficult if not
impossible, for Moscow to maintain direct rule or domination.</p>


<h4>Stalinism in Western Europe</h4>

<p>The result of the war and the national liberation struggle, the general
disgust of the masses, the rotting of the capitalist system which had provoked
two world wars, the defeat of fascism, and the victory of Russia in the
warall led inevitably to a powerful revolutionary wave in all Western Europe.
The tragic thing was that whereas the First World War had seen the revolutionary
wave stemmed by reformism, after the Second World War it was Stalinism that
saved Western European capitalism from destruction.</p>

<p>In France and Italy in particular, the Communist Parties became the dominant
force within the working class and with their control of the unions and other
mass organisations of the proletariat, with a powerful apparatus and machine,
organisationally the Stalinist parties were far stronger than Bolshevism had
ever been before the Russian revolution. The possibility of taking power
peacefully, or almost peacefully, was rooted in the situation. But owing to the
world diplomatic situation of Stalinism and its fear of the masses, they
betrayed the first revolutionary wave in the coalition popular fronts which they
formed. With this powerful aid from Stalinism and the usual role of social
democracy, and thanks to the assistance of mighty American imperialism, decaying
capitalism in Europe has managed to recover. With the assistance of Marshall Aid
and the marvellous recuperative powers of modern production, ailing capitalism
has managed to restore itself and the productive machine. In this situation,
with the passing of the first revolutionary wave, the open struggle between
American imperialism and the Stalinist bureaucracy, Stalinism, in the interests
of the latter, has engaged in a series of irresponsible adventures without any
real perspective except that of weakening Western Europe in the interests of the
bureaucracy.</p>

<p>The wave of irresponsible strikes, without a clear perspective of a struggle
for power, succeeded in exhausting and frustrating the proletariat. This policy
assisted the bourgeoisie, after they had recovered from the first revolutionary
shocks, in re-establishing their state machine, even though its firmness is only
apparent rather than real. The crisis of the regimes in Western Europe is best
shown in the situations in France and Italy.</p>

<p>In these countries the crisis of social democracy is the clearest reflection
of this. Despite the failure of Stalinism to seize power the proletariat has
produced a split in the Socialist Party in Italy<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-7" name="doc-7">(7)</a></sup> and a
chronic crisis in the SFIO in France. There is a crumbling away of support from
the workers and despite its crimes and losses in the last period with the
despair of the workers, Stalinism remains the mass party of the working class.
This is so precisely because of the lack of a mass revolutionary alternative.</p>

<p>However, while dents have been made in the armour of Stalinism with the
experience of the workers, including the Tito movement, nevertheless, as yet, no
decisive blow has been struck against the Stalinist forces. As elections have
shown in France and Italy, they still retain the support of the basic strata of
the working class. In the face of economic slump, Stalinism can recover and even
gain support from further sections of the workers and petit bourgeoisie whom
they have not affected in the past. The basic section of the workers in these
countries still has many illusions in Stalinism as a revolutionary force;
illusions which have been strengthened by the 'left' line of the Stalinists in
the last few years. A long process of disillusionment will be necessary before
the working class comes to understand the real nature of Stalinism.</p>

<p>It is theoretically possible under certain conditions that the Stalinists
might even come to power in these countries. If they do so, they could not
retain power for a lengthy period, and would be bound to come into conflict with
the Moscow bureaucracy in any event. Whether they come into conflict with Moscow
quickly or not, an immediate process of differentiation from top to bottom
within the Communist Party would commence. Whatever the result of fissures in
the CP which would be opened up, the Stalinists would be unlikely to maintain
power for any protracted period.</p>


<h4>Spain</h4>

<p>The convulsive character of the present epoch and the impossibility of a
lengthy stabilisation of capitalism is revealed not only by the weakness of
imperialism and the national awakening of Asia but also by the shaky foundations
of economic upswing and relative tranquillity in Western Europe. The Spanish
problem once again is raising itself as a key question for Europe and the fate
of the world labour movement.</p>

<p>It is twelve years since the Spanish workers were enmeshed in a terrible
civil war, due to the mistakes and crimes of the labour movement, especially the
Stalinists.</p>

<p>Now the decay and corruption of the regime have reached such a pitch that the
awakening of the workers has already begun. The military-police fascist regime,
far from solving any of the problems of the weak and backward Spanish economy,
exacerbated them to an enormous degree. The regime in its inefficiency, futility
and rottenness, basing itself on an alliance of Church, landowners, army and
industrialists, bears more of a resemblance to the role of the Chiang clique
than any European government. Like Czarism it has ceased to have any mass base
within the population.</p>

<p>All strata of the population, <em>all the social classes, </em>feel the crisis
of the regime and are beginning to search for a way out. Fascism, once
established, can only maintain itself given the atomisation, inertia, despair,
apathy and indifference of the masses. The recovery of working-class solidarity,
initiative and action can spell the beginning of its doom. So the strikes in
Barcelona and the Basque country, mark the beginning of the new Spanish
revolution. The process of history of the revolution, interrupted in 1939 by the
intervention of the brutal fascist heel, begins anew. The fascist regime is
doomed. <em>The only question is that of the tempo of events in which its
destruction will take place.</em></p>

<p>The beginning of the end for Mussolini was marked by the strikes of the
Italian workers - a few months later he fell. The events in Spain, like those of
Italy, are an answer to the sceptics who saw only the monolithic strength of a
totalitarian regime, and sagely preached the impossibility of its overthrow from
the internal forces of the country itself. Italy was not a convincing example
for them because of the defeats of the regime in wax, from which they deduced
the causes of the collapse of the fascist system.</p>

<p>The peace-time crisis of the Franco regime provides a crushing refutation of
this undialectical method of thinking. The same school of social 'philosophy'
bows down in despair before the phenomenon of totalitarian Stalinism.</p>

<p>In the long run the intervention of the Russian workers will produce a
paralysis of the Stalinist regime far more pitiful and helpless than the coming
death agony of the Franco regime. The all powerful and almighty bureaucracy
(which reveals its caste rule as one of permanent crisis in the never-ending
purges and repressions of the regime) in its hour of trial will collapse into
impotence under the hammer blows of the workers. Probably the hour of its
collapse will begin with strikes on similar lines to those of Spain and Italy.</p>

<p>As has been determined by theory on the basis of historical experience, the
conditions for revolution are now manifesting themselves under the blows of the
awakening Spanish working class. The doomed ruling class is beginning to split
at the top under the pressure of the rumblings of social discontent from below.</p>

<p>They wish some reforms and concessions to be granted to the workers and
peasants, which will leave the basis of the social regime intact. So it was in
the doomed Czarist regime. But any attempt to forestall the movement from below
by restoration of the outlived monarchy or similar manoeuvres, will merely
precipitate the movement which they so dread.</p>

<p>The unbearable social tension is reflected by this attempt on the part of its
main beneficiaries, the landowners, Church, army and industrialists, to escape
retribution, which they fear the overthrow of the regime will bring at the hands
of the long suffering masses. But this plotting, percolating to the masses
below, successful or not, can but add impetus to the gathering revolutionary
[tide].</p>

<p>The ruling class is seeking a way of escape. The middle class, in most of its
strata, from top to bottom, is vacillating or even manifesting open sympathy for
the struggle of the workers. The regime cannot find a basis of support here.</p>

<p>Lastly, the magnificent strikes of the workers under such adverse conditions
reveal once again the capacity for self-sacrifice, endurance and struggle which
the heroic Spanish workers revealed in such large measure in the revolutionary
struggles between 1931-7.</p>

<p><em>Yes! The conditions for revolution are present! </em>In 1936, despite the
sabotage of the workers' leadership, the Spanish workers revealed their
aspirations for the socialist revolution by their deeds and activity. Without
the unfavourable international environment and the intervention of Hitler and
Mussolini, despite the criminal policies of their leaderships even in 1936, it
would probably have been possible for the workers to defeat Franco. Without
foreign aid, without the Moorish troops and the 'non-intervention' of Stalinist
Russia and the capitalist 'democracies' in the early decisive stages it would
have been difficult, if not impossible, for Franco to triumph.</p>

<p>Now the degeneration of the Spanish ruling class has gone further under the
Franco regime. The desire of the masses for a socialist change has been
intensified. They will not be fobbed off for long by merely superficial change
and reforms. Especially as only fundamental social revolution can even begin to
solve the problems of the Spanish nation.</p>

<p>In the meantime Spanish Morocco, far from being a reservoir for Franco's
shock troops, will most likely be affected by rebellion once a mass movement
begins on the mainland. The international bourgeoisie would find it impossible
to interfere by direct intervention. If Britain finds it difficult to carry out
armed intervention against Persia (Iran), it would be impossible for Spain.</p>

<p>The intervention of American dollars would most likely have no more
auspicious results than the ill-omened aid for the doomed Chinese clique in the
Pacific.</p>

<p>The continuity of the revolution, broken in 1939, bids fair to return to the
situation of a <em>new 1936</em>, under even more favourable conditions
nationally and internationally. <em>But 1936 means an upsurge towards
power by the workers. </em>An upsurge in which the workers will learn rapidly
under favourable conditions and in which the bitter experience of the past will
have hardened and strengthened the will of the workers. Only the Stalinist
counter-revolution saved the day for Spanish capitalism. But they only succeeded
in this role (leaving aside the policies of the POUM, Anarchist, and Socialist
left) due to the influence of Russia and the supply of arms and other vital
materials by Russia. The Stalinist and bourgeois counter-revolution, succeeded
(despite the absence of a Marxist revolutionary party) only because of the
conditions sketched above.</p>

<p>Today the conditions are far more unfavourable for them. The bourgeoisie in a
new 1931-6 upsurge would become as much a cypher and plaything of events as in
1936. The Stalinists most likely, in the revolution, despite their unpardonable
crimes and betrayals, would become once again a powerful force, <em>but by no
means a decisive one. </em>All the left parties and organisations would spring
forward again as mass forces: the CNT, UGT<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-8" name="doc-8">(8)</a></sup>, the POUM and
the Socialist Party.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the possibility for the rapid creation of a mass
revolutionary party would be present. But it is theoretically not excluded that
the pressure of the Spanish workers, with the inevitably stormy initiative of
the masses, might push <em>the CNT, the POUM, and the Socialist left in the
direction of taking Power into their own hands. </em>Under these conditions a new
version of the Paris Commune might ensue in Spain.</p>

<p>A Spanish Commune in its turn would be of decisive world significance. It
could be the beginning of the regroupment of the world labour movement. Already
in Western Europe the splintering away of Cucchi<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-9" name="doc-9">(9)</a></sup> and
Magnani in Italy, a split off in France, and the creation of a Titoist Communist
Party in Germany, are symptoms of a positive crisis within Stalinism. At
present, because of the impotence and practical non-existence of a revolutionary
Marxist current, they have been in the main of mixed progressive and reactionary
elements. In France and Italy it has been the cold war and the blatant
revelation of the CPs as tools of the Kremlin's foreign policy which have
produced this result.</p>

<p>Because of the failure to draw clear internationalist and socialist
conclusions - rather to stand on the position of the <em>union sacree </em>-
they have been doomed to sterility and have left the Stalinist forces largely
intact.</p>

<p>But a Commune in Spain would have entirely different results. It would split
the CPs in Western Europe from top to bottom. It would produce a ferment and
differentiation in social democracy in Western Germany and the Labour Party in
Britain as well as other socialist parties in Western Europe.</p>

<p>It could mark a new chapter in the resurgence of the labour movement on new
foundations. It would mark the beginning of the end of Stalinism in the Western
labour movement. It would be the beginning of the end for Stalinism in Eastern
Europe, Russia and Asia. It would begin the collapse of capitalism in the West.
On this foundation, in a few years after initial confusion and muddle, it could
result in the restoration of the world labour movement on Marxist foundations.</p>


<h4>Britain and America</h4>

<p>Both in Britain and America Stalinism remains as a weak force which has
hardly penetrated the massesas yet. In the case of Britain this is to a large
extent dictated both by historical and moral factors. The tremendous wealth of
British capitalism, coupled with the skill of the ruling class in deceit on the
one hand and its ability to retreat and compromise on the other in moments of
danger, have established a firm position for British capitalism in the past.
Even though the dominant position of British imperialism has now passed into
history and Britain has been pushed back into the ranks of second-rate powers,
nevertheless sufficient wealth (together with the assistance from America) has
been accumulated to enable British capitalists, to a certain extent, to live on
their fat. At the same time the crisis of capitalism on a world scale; the
onrush of Stalinism in Asia and Europe; the loss of confidence of the ruling
class; in the old age tradition of rule; the need for a bold programme if
Britain is to renovate herself; the radicalisation of the working class: all
these have resulted in a position where in the first term of power the Labour
government has largely carried out a radical programme of reforms and the
nationalisation of those industries ruined by British capitalism. All this has
drawn the <em>decisive section </em>of the workers in the labour movement, above
all the <em>organised working class, </em>solidly behind the Labour government.
The latter has been compelled to introduce a period of counter reforms, due to
the exigencies of the cold war and the increasing burdens of armaments, the
brunt of which has been placed on the shoulders of the working and middle
classes. While support of sections of the middle class and backward workers may
have edged away, nevertheless, at this stage the core of the working class
remains for the time being behind the Labour leadership.</p>

<p>In addition, the working class traditions in Britain nurtured over a long
period, together with the even more profound tradition of democracy within the
ranks of the labour movement, due to the prolonged struggle for political and
trade union rights in the last century, have been additional factors repelling
the workers away from Stalinism. More and more publicity as to Stalinist methods
in Eastern Europe and Russia, the barbaric excesses of the Stalinists, in the
conduct of affairs, the lack of democratic rights, slave labour, the
concentration camps, and the whole totalitarian set-up of Stalinism cynically
rediscovered by the capitalists and the social-democratic press, on the
background sketched above, have further weakened the mass appeal of the
Stalinists. The tactics of Stalinism in the cold war, skilfully utilised by the
ruling class and the Labour leaders, have further alienated the mass of the
working class from the CP.</p>

<p>However, despite all these obstacles, Stalinism has succeeded in maintaining
a formidable apparatus, which, though weakened, has still managed to penetrate
the trade unions and capture some of the key positions, owing to the militant
and self-sacrificing work of the rank and file.</p>

<p>Whether Stalinism will succeed in attracting an important part of the British
working class to its banner will depend on a series of factors. The sweep of
Stalinism over Europe would inevitably assist them in gaining support in
Britain. Big scale struggles in France and Italy could push the masses in the
direction of Stalinism. While under conditions of crisis and slump which will
follow the re-armament boom - if it does not end in war - an important segment
of the workers will be impelled in a Stalinist direction. Nevertheless, whether
they become dominant tendencies will depend on the effect repercussions will
have inside the labour movement.</p>

<p>Events at home and abroad will push big sections of the workers in the labour
and trade union movement to the left. The most conscious section will look for a
revolutionary road which is different to the repulsive totalitarianism of
Stalinism. It is not excluded that the mass of the Labour Party, including an
important section of its leadership, will be pushed far in a revolutionary
direction. New currents will grow up inside the Labour Party; it is possible
that the right wing will be isolated and a field for Marxist ideas to penetrate
on a mass scale for the first time will be created by the wave of events.</p>

<p>In this situation the possibility will exist to win large sections, if not
the dominant grouping within the Labour Party, to the banner of revolutionary
socialist democracy. The democratic traditions in Britain constitute a precious
heritage which can be utilised to prepare for the transformation from capitalist
democracy to a soviet democracy, a transformation through revolutionary
struggle. If revolutionary Marxism does not succeed in gaining the car of the
masses then a turn towards Stalinism would be virtually inevitable, <em>in lieu </em>of
any other alternative. However, possibilities of the revolutionary awakening of
the British masses are enormous. Events will teach important lessons.</p>

<p>Stalinism today has less attractive power than it previously possessed.
Before they fall victim to the wiles of Stalinism the masses will try again and
again to find some alternative means of expression within the labour movement.
The lag of events and the long delay in the development of a revolutionary mass
movement in Britain, act as a fortunate historical accident in the given
condition.</p>

<p>In America, the working class has not broken politically from the old
capitalist parties. This backwardness is due to a variety of historical factors:
the richness of America, its freshness historically, the gigantic productive
economy, the high standard of living of the workers, etc. This historical
backwardness can be transformed by a leap ahead in the next epoch. The
combativeness of American workers, as reflected on the trade union field and in
the strike struggles, presages a similar militancy on the political field, once
the bankruptcy of American capitalism has been clearly demonstrated. The 1929-33
economic debacle was but a dress rehearsal for the economic blizzard which will
overtake America in the coming epoch. The greatest capitalist power of all will
reveal the most pitiful helplessness in the face of the collapse of its system.
Under those conditions, radicalisation and the awakening of the American workers
would take place at great speed. Like the movement of industrial organisation
which followed the world slump, so would the turn towards independent politics
proceed. The weakness of Stalinism as a fifth column for Russian totalitarianism
is apparent at the present time.</p>

<p>However, under the conditions of crisis even in America it is possible that
they will grow. But the mass of American workers will move in the direction of
independent politics first. Possibilities will be there of creating a mass
revolutionary tendency fighting against reformism, capitalist politics and
Stalinism.</p>

<p>The creation of a mass revolutionary party in any important country in the
world, even without the capture of power, can be the beginning of the end for
Stalinism on a world scale: first in the countries where they do not have
complete power, then in the countries under the totalitarian heel.</p>


<h4>Western Germany</h4>

<p>Western Germany too is a decisive area where Stalinism is comparatively weak.
The experience of the German masses of the barbarised Stalinist army and the
experience of Eastern Germany, have pushed the masses back to social democracy
for lack of an alternative. The revulsion against Stalinism has been such that
in contradistinction to Italy, discredited social democracy has emerged as the
overwhelmingly dominant tendency among the masses. However, this can only be
during the period of economic upswing, occasioned by Marshall Aid and the
building up of the ruined economy following the war. The social democracy has
been forced to adopt a radical posture even now. The bitter experience of the
German workers with monopoly capital, which financed the Nazis and destroyed
their movements and rights, has left a profound impression on the minds of the
German toilers.</p>

<p>This experience is reflected in the militancy in the trade union movement
which won equal rights on the board of management in the coal and steel industry
in the Ruhr. It was reflected earlier in strikes against the attemps at nazi
revival.</p>

<p>The German workers have supported social democracy because of their violent
revulsion against the Stalinist reaction. However, in the event of a slump and
mass unemployment (on a scale similar to that which preceded Hitler) in Western
Germany on the one side, while in Eastern Germany full employment continued,
this would undoubtedly create a tremendous effect amongst the German masses.
Possibilities would be there for Stalinism to regain influence. Far more
important, however, would be the radicalising effect that such a situation would
have on the social democracy and the trade union movement already tending in a
semi-centrist direction. Revolutionary currents would spring up within the ranks
of social-democracy.</p>

<p>One way or the other centrist and other left groupings would be created
within its ranks. Either a revolutionary tendency would gain a majority within
the ranks of social democracy or it would fall to pieces. Possibilities would
exist for revolutionising the German masses, against capitalist democracy on the
one side and Stalinist totalitarianism on the other: for a socialist soviet
democracy as promised by the Russian Revolution. Only thus could the masses be
prevented from falling into the hands of Stalinism through sheer despair.</p>


<h4>The Situation in Russia</h4>

<p>The most remarkable phenomenon in attempting to re-evaluate the economic,
political and social realities in Russia lies in the fact that basically the
analysis which was made by Trotsky needs no fundamental modification.</p>

<p>The tremendous advantages of state ownership (as the economic transitional
form of the future society) have revealed themselves once again in the
reconstruction following the Second World War. Despite the fact that Russia was
the most devastated country, her speed of re-equipment relative to her
productive capacity has far outstripped that of the West. Thanks to the
achievements of the five-year plans her recovery has been far faster than in
1920-9. Once again, apparently, the speed of recovery has exceeded what was
anticipated by the bureaucrats.</p>

<p>The idea that the collective farms would tend to break down and that on the
basis of a weakened Soviet Union (in the war) this could be the starting point
for the restoration of capitalism in Russia, has been revealed as false by the
economic developments. It is true, that owing to the needs of the war for
equipment such as tanks etc, the production of tractors and other agricultural
machinery dropped catastrophically and thus, superficially at least, certain
tendencies appeared which gave weight to this view. But as was predicted, on the
basis of a more sober assessment, very rapidly this trend has been reversed. The
wheels of progress cannot be so easily turned back. Agriculture following in the
wake of the revival of industry, has seen new steps taken towards greater and
greater centralisation and the further development from collectives to giant
collectives. In a certain sense this marks the first beginnings of
industrialisation of agriculture. As always with Stalinist measures, it has a
contradictory content in that, on the one hand, it marks definite progress in
the development of agriculture, eliminating as it does the scattered character
of the peasantry, grouping them together in the 'agrotowns'; this measure having
been carried out with typical bureaucratic brutality. On the other hand, the aim
of the bureaucracy in carrying through this measure (aside from its economic
aspect) lies in gaining better control and regimentation over the peasants by
the familiar methods of the Stalinist apparatus.</p>

<p>The war and the post-war period revealed Russia as the major European
industrial power with a dynamic economic base and through the four five-year
plans technique has been vastly improved. The 20 years of industrial expansion
in Russia would be equal in training and technique to a century of 'normal'
capitalist development.</p>

<p>Thus Russian economy has been completely transformed. Even in the field of
precision work, such as jet aeroplanes, the Russian products compare favourably
with the best of Britain and America. During the war, Russian technique, as
shown in the production of artillery and tanks, revealed itself as already equal
to the West. With the completion of the new five-year plan, undoubtedly the
Soviet Union appeared as the greatest industrial power that Europe has ever had,
far exceeding the record of mighty industrial Germany. However it is not the
enfeebled capitalism of Europe with which the Soviet Union is competing but the
mighty colossus across the Atlantic; America dwarfs not only Russia but the
combined economy of Europe.</p>

<p>The Russian economy, however, still develops in a contradictory way. The most
modern technique still runs in harness with the most primitive forms of
production (slave labour etc) This is reflected in the fact that on a <em>per
capita </em>basis production in Russia is still extremely low, far lower than in
Western Europe.</p>

<p>Thus even in the economic sphere Russian society evolves painfully and in
contradictions.</p>

<p>In expanding their base into Eastern Europe the bureacracy proceeded blindly
and empirically. <em>As far as the bureaucracy is concerned the destruction of
capitalism and the extension of state ownership is not dictated in any way by
the needs of socialism or the interests of the working class. </em>Like a ruling
caste or class, the bureaucracy is only interested in the maintenance and
extension of its own power, privileges, income and prestige. In the beginning,
short-sightedly, they plundered and stripped Eastern Europe of machinery and raw
materials for the immediate and pressing needs of the Russian economy. Now they
are integrating Eastern Europe for the purpose of developing it in the interest
of the Russian economy and the Russian bureaucracy. Thus the economic base has
been extended beyond the bounds of the narrow horizon of the Russian state
itself. This undoubtedly gives an impetus to the development of the Russian
economy due to the division of labour and the industrial resources, manpower,
etc, which Eastern Europe possesses. At the same time, it assists trade between
Russia and her satellites and the Western world for the benefit of the
bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, with all these added economic resources, Eastern Europe acts as
an auxiliary - and not as a fundamental addition - both economically and
politically, to the Russian economy. It still remains subsidiary to the Russian
economy itself.</p>

<p>The bureaucracy is preoccupied with the fear of a new world clash. After the
experience of the Second World War they look with foreboding to an attack from
the citadel of world capitalism, at the same time taking advantage of the
extreme weakness and uncertainty of the capitalist world in the last few years
by grabbing at its extremeties - Korea, Indo-China etc. The American resistance
having hardened, the bureaucracy will tend to effect a compromise. Both sides
under present conditions are afraid of resorting to arms because of the
catastrophic consequences that would ensue; briefly, the danger to civilisation,
the inevitability of an endless military conflict and the struggle which would
become one between the Eurasian land mass and the American land mass; the danger
of political revolution in Russia and Europe and the social revolution in
America.</p>

<p>As the economic base has been extended the new aristocracy has raised itself
in ever greater measure above the level of the masses. The gulf between the
toilers and the bureaucracy has reached fantastic levels. At the same time, the
needs of the industrialisation and the higher level of skill and technique, tend
to force a gradual if slow increase in the standard of living. Undoubtedly,
there has been an improvement in the standard of living over the terrible level
to which it had fallen by the end of the war. Nevertheless, the bureaucracy,
haunted by the disproportion between Russian and American industry, still places
the main emphasis on the development of heavy industry. The consumer goods
industries, in proportion, are lagging far behind. In housing, food, clothing,
Russia as a whole still more approaches the level of Asia than the Western
World.</p>

<p>The mounting contradictions in Russia force the bureaucracy to utilise the
world situation in order to still the possibilities of opposition in Russia. The
evils in Russian society are explained away under cover of the threat of attack
from Western imperialism and the fear of restoration of capitalism by external
intervention. The White Guard<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-10" name="doc-10">(10)</a></sup> puppets of American
imperialism (Kerensky and Co) with their programme and policy of restoration of
private ownership in the event of a victory of the West in the war, play into
the hands of the bureaucracy, and this threat acts as a powerful means by which
the masses can be held down.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the contradictions, despite all repressions, continue to
manifest themselves in Russian society. Symptomatic of these are the recurrent
purges, especially in Eastern Europe and in the national republics. The latest
is the removal of the entire Central Committee of Uzbekistan and Azerbaijain and
the widespread purge in the Ukraine. The national question remains a permanent
ulcer of discontent in Russian society. At the same time the increase in the
proletariat due to the economic successes and the industrialisation of
agriculture increases the mighty force of the working class. [The bureaucracy
can] temporarily succeed, with the aid of the MVD<sup class="anote"><a href="#foot-11" name="doc-11">(11)</a></sup> in
maintaining the proletariat in a state of forced disunity, in face of the ever
increasing power of the monster state. But Bonapartism remains, just the same, a
regime of permanent crisis. The unstable relationship of forces, the stifling of
all initiative and culture within the framework of the police state, the
complete regimentation and the lack of democracy, will all come more and more
into conflict with the needs of the economy itself. Despite the economic
successes, the inefficiency and parasitism of the bureaucracy act as a relative
fetter on the development of the Russian economy. Freed from this incubus, on a
far more harmonious basis, even greater economic gains would be possible.</p>

<p>How long the bureaucracy will last, however, can be determined only by events
both at home and abroad. Revolution in the West would cause repercussions in the
East. However, developments in Russia itself, even without revolution in the
West, could cause the overthrow of the bureaucracy. The never-ending purges show
the possibilities of a shake-up in the bureaucracy under the pressure of the
masses. Any incident, such as the death of Stalin, might precipitate a struggle
between different cliques within the bureaucracy (though, this seems unlikely at
the present stage) and this could open the way for the entry of the masses onto
the political scene.</p>

<p>In the long run the movement of the masses from below will have its effect on
the hierarchical structure of the bureaucracy. Discontent at the base, in due
time, produces splits at the top. The example of Spain, not withstanding its
different social structure, shows how a totalitarian regime can be suddenly
shaken by the movement of the masses. Once it begins it could acquire a greater
sweep in Russia than in Spain.</p>

<p>The time scale is indeterminate, years, perhaps decades. This will be decided
historically by the conjunction of the multiple factors involved.</p>

<p>The totalitarian state will inevitably land in an impasse. The final hour of
the bureaucracy will come. Inexorably, the political revolution will develop.
There will be a return to workers' democracy, but on a higher level. However,
the developments will take place with a different situation nationally and
internationally. The fate of the Russian revolution is bound up now more than
ever with the fate of the world revolution. Revolution in Russia would
immediately provoke revolution in the West and vice-versa. The possibilities are
manifold in the next historical epoch. On the background of the world decay of
capitalism, the return to private ownership in Russia, by internal means, is
extremely unlikely if not impossible. External American intervention might
facilitate such a restoration.</p>

<p>Despite the encrustation of Stalinist reaction over the conquests of October,
whereby only the basic economic structure remains, the viability of state
ownership and planning provides the skeleton on which the flesh of socialism
will be built. On this basis Stalinism is doomed as a parasitic growth which
will be swept away and socialism will prevail in the long run.</p>


<h4>General Conclusions and Perspectives</h4>

<p>Thus the possibilities on a world scale with a continuing decay and collapse
of world capitalism-imperialism are manifold. The cold war between West and East
is an expression in reality of the impasse of world capitalism and the
impossibility of the bourgeoisie finding a way out. A long period opens out of
struggle between Stalinism and capitalism and of the working class against both.
The skirmishes in Korea and at other extremities of the world mark, on the one
hand, the decline of imperialism, but on the other, the unlikelihood, for a long
term of years ahead, of American and world imperialism attempting to solve their
problems by force of arms. Despite the build-up against Stalinist 'aggression'
and 'enslavement', as against the so-called 'free world', nevertheless the
political prerequisites for war do not exist as yet.</p>

<p>The working class in Western Europe and the Anglo-Saxon world has not been
defeated or regimented. War would almost inevitably mean the collapse of Western
Europe and the seizure of possibly all Asia and all Europe unified under the
domination of the Kremlin. An endless war between the continents would be in
prospect a war which neither side could hope to win. A war which would mean the
ruination of the entire world economy and the possible collapse of civilisation.
It would mean a war of attrition which would have the possibility of continuing
for decades from a purely military standpoint, a war in which there could be no
winners and which would provoke revolutionary convulsions against the futile and
senseless slaughter which it would involve. Only the defeat of the labour
movement in Western Europe, Britain and America and the consolidation of
reaction on its bones could prepare a firm foundation for imperialism to wage
war. Far more likely, the re-armament boom will end in financial and economic
catastrophe, though, of course, war is not excluded. The Western world still
remains the decisive arena which will decide the fate of the planet.</p>

<p>For Marxism neither pessimism nor spurious optimism can play a role in
determining the analysis of events. The first necessity is to understand the
meaning of the conjuncture of historical forces leading to the present world
situation.</p>

<p>The overthrow of Stalinism in the areas in which it holds sway will most
likely be a long term process. It is true that Stalinism remains a regime of
permanent crisis. In it, the element of socialism in the state economy is in
permanent contradiction to the Bonapartist state apparatus and the privileged
caste whose interests it serves. Thus, the regime of Stalinism in Russia itself
bears a striking resemblance, even more than the Bonapartism of bourgeois
origin, to the Caesarism of Ancient Rome in the epoch of the decay of the
Empire. In that it bears a close resemblance to fascism. In the long run, the
regime of Bonapartist autocracy is incompatible with the economic base set in
being by the October Revolution. That is the source of the permanent
convulsions, and the endless removal of officials by the insatiable moloch in
the Kremlin. The victories of Stalinism can only be a preparation for its
downfall. But this is only so from. a long-term point of view. Undoubtedly,
Stalinism has been strengthened for a temporary period.</p>

<p>History has shown nuances of development in the transition from one economy
to another. Before our eyes we have another rich lesson in the fact that even
the greatest historical geniuses cannot lay down a blueprint for the change from
one society to another. Only the general laws can be worked out in advance. The
transition from slavery to feudalism was preceded by a long epoch of Caesarism
in Ancient Rome; the transition from feudalism to capitalism also saw the regime
of absolute nonarchy. In the early period of bourgeois dominance a long
Historical epoch of military-police dictatorship ensued. However, before the
full potential of capitalist production could be realised, new revolutions for
political democracy took place. These were an absolute necessity for a full
flowering of the productive forces even on a capitalist basis. Without democracy
the development of modern civilisation would have been hampered and restricted.</p>

<p>Owing to the rise of Stalinism the revolution in the West has been delayed.
Due to the development of the revolution in a backward country and the failure
of its extension to advanced countries in the West, a period of Bonapartism was
historically inevitable. This in its turn unleashes new historical forces.</p>

<p>The bureaucracy, which grew out of the backwardness and the defeats of the
proletariat, once having established its hegemony, is not prepared to give up
its position, even once its temporary role has been fulfilled.</p>

<p>Thus in part of Asia, Eastern Europe and Russia, the transition from
capitalism to socialism is taking place in the forms which could not be
anticipated by either Marx or Lenin. However, the task of the emancipation of
the working class can only be consciously completed by the working class itself.
The bureaucracy has aims, intentions, and interests (in particular a vested
interest in state dominance) of its own and like the Bonapartist cliques in the
period of the bourgeois assent, cannot be removed except by force. At the same
time, for the full development of the productive forces and for a transition to
socialism, the abolition of the state and all forms of bureaucracy are
essential. For a full flowering of productive forces, far more than capitalism
(which is regulated to a certain extent through the medium of the market and
thus automatically checked and developed), socialism, and just as much the
transition to socialism, requires direct participation and democratic checking
of planning in the process of production, by the masses themselves.</p>

<p>Without democracy, bureaucratic excesses clog and fetter the full harmonious
development of the productive forces. Inevitably, as bureaucratic autocracy was
overthrown and gave way to a higher political form of bourgeois domination, so <em>proletarian
Bonapartism </em>- Stalinism - will have to give way to proletarian democracy. In
those areas where Stalinism has extended itself in the form of proletarian
Bonapartism, the proletariat will have to pay with the new political revolution,
before the ascent to socialism can really be begun. Stalinism for a longer or
shorter period can only remain a temporary check, in the evolution of the
working class in the direction of socialism.</p>

<p>'All roads lead to Communism' is the confident battle cry of Stalinism at the
present time. They are more right than they think. Either through a healthy
proletarian revolution in a major country of the West, or if Stalinism extends
its sway, inevitably political revolution against Stalinism, will prepare the
way for the sounding of its death knell.</p>
