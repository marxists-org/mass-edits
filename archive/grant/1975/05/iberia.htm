<p class="fst">Marxism would be a very simple
theory if all that was necessary was a slavish repetition of the ideas of the
past. Sectarians and opportunists of all the different cliques and sects ignore
the methods and principles which retain their validity and from which invaluable
lessons can be drawn from the works of the great teachers. They repeat a few
phrases gleaned from the past which they think turn them into brilliant
strategists. The works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky form a precious
heritage and we must encourage young comrades to study them assiduously. But
they do not provide blueprints for the process of history.</p>

<p>Due to the throwing back of
Marxism by the betrayals of reformism and Stalinism, the genuine Marxists were
reduced to a tiny handful. Trotsky could truly claim that like Marx he sowed
dragons but reaped not fleas but harmful microbes. Since the Second World War
the cliques of Hansen and the SWP, Mandel, Pablo, Healy, Maitain, and Lambert
have been completely incapable of orienting and re-orienting to the development
of events. Revolution, which is the crucial test for revolutionaries, has found
them wanting. Thus they showed themselves completely incapable of understanding
the events in Greece in 1944, the development of Stalinist states in Eastern
Europe, the revolution in China and Cuba, the transformation of Syria and Burma
and the French movement of 1968. Now as could be expected they have not an iota
of comprehension of the development of the revolution in Ethiopia and more
important Portugal. They are good for nothing - except to sow confusion among
students which constitute their main support.</p>

<p>However, we deal with some of their ideas in the section on Portugal</p>

<p>The reaction between the
objective and subjective factors of history has a rich literature in the theory
of Marxism. It is the lack of a strong revolutionary International  -  due to
the degeneration of the Third International  -  which is responsible for the
peculiar course of the revolution in the under-developed world and the events in
China, Vietnam, Eastern Europe and so on.</p>

<p>Only the dialectical method can
help us unravel the contradictions of world developments in the last era.</p>

<p>For a period of approximately
three decades world capitalism has developed all the potentialities that
remained in the system in the industrialised countries and partly also in the
under-developed World.</p>


<p>Production has been developed at
a rate among the highest in history. Four times the productive forces created in
the entire history of humanity up to the Second World War have been produced
since the holocaust.</p>

<p>It was this that gave a relative
stability to the capitalist system and in its turn sealed the degeneration of
Stalinism and Reformism. This in turn reinforced the power of capitalism.</p>

<p>But even at the height of the
boom the Colonial Revolution in Africa, Asia and Latin America, on the
peripheries of world capitalism was an indication of processes which later would
affect the heart.</p>

<p>The Colonial Revolution
manifested itself in peculiar ways and in a distorted form due to the world
balance of forces, the pressure of the insoluble problems under capitalism  - 
Imperialism and Landlordism  -  and the urgent necessity of a transformation of
society, if that society was not to stagnate and impose ferocious conditions of
hunger and penury on the masses. It was the impossibility of fully developing
the forces of production under capitalism-landlordism which gave the drive to
the colonial revolution.</p>

<p>But without a pole of attraction
in dynamic mass Marxist parties in the industrial countries or even a single
healthy workers' state, the colonial revolution has been perverted. <em>On the
road of capitalism there was no way forward</em>. With the world balance of
forces and the model of Stalinist Russia - the mighty Chinese revolution from
its inception developed, in the aims of its leaders, as a Stalinist state  - 
even though in the beginning, and probably also at the present stage, with the
support of the overwhelming majority of the population and of the workers.</p>

<p>This in its turn has put its
stamp on the revolution in colonial countries. The Cuban Revolution, beginning
with bourgeois democratic leadership and aims, ended in the organisation of a
form of Proletarian Bonapartism. The Ethiopian revolution, like that of Syria
and Burma, seems to be developing on the lines of sections of the officer corps,
leaning on the support of the workers and peasants, purging the country of
feudalism and then with the incapacity and feebleness of the native bourgeois
carrying the revolution through by expropriating the bourgeoisie which has shown
itself incapable of leading the fight for the development of a modern economy.
With the backwardness of the country, the limited understanding of the military
caste leadership leads them to accept &quot;socialism&quot;, i.e. the
military-bureaucratic caste system on the model of Russia, China and Cuba, as
the solution to the problems of economic expansion so imperatively necessary for
the country. The economic might of Russia and China, which is abolishing
backwardness with seven-league boots, acts as a mighty magnet. The narrow
national limitedness of the rulers in Stalinist states far from repelling them
acts as a mighty attraction. Not least of the attractions consists in the
organisation of &quot;socialism&quot; and the privileges of the military and
bureaucratic castes, which the intelligentsia and military middle layers would
consider to be the natural order of society.</p>


<p>Consequently, because the
development of productive forces is hampered by the elements of capitalism and
big business which are subordinate to, and collaborators of, imperialism, they
are swept away. In a twisted version of the permanent revolution this lower
officer caste becomes  -  for a period  -  the unconscious agent of history, in
carrying through the necessary tasks of the state-ification of the economy.</p>

<p>All these processes are due to
the delay of the proletarian revolution in the advanced countries. But they
constitute the lappings at the edges and the undermining of the foundations of
world capitalism. Not accidently most of the bourgeois Bonapartist dictators and
the rulers of most of the colonial countries which have gained their
independence rule in the name of a mythical form of &quot;socialism&quot;. This
is because of the profound effects in the consciousness of myriads of the
oppressed of the Russian and Chinese Revolutions. But this in turn for a whole
epoch has reinforced the hold of the Russian bureaucracy over the Russian
masses. At the same time it has strengthened the power of the reformist and
Stalinist parties in the industrialised countries and deepened their nationalist
limited outlook and de-generation.</p>

<p>In previous documents we have
sketched out the consequences of this process in the isolation of genuine
Marxism, i.e. Trotskyism  -  the loss of revolutionary tradition and the
degeneration of the cliques claiming to represent the Fourth International. The
whole process has served as a sort of chain reaction. Each factor  -  the boom
in the industrial states, distorted or deformed workers states being set up in
colonial countries, the gangrenous degeneration of the mass workers' parties,
have acted to reinforce and prop each other up. For a whole epoch that has been
the situation. It has been a vicious circle  -  one factor reinforcing and
tending to develop the opposing factors.</p>

<p>In this situation there could be
no room for the organisation of mass Trotskyist parties - leaving aside the
strategic, tactical and political errors of a momentous magnitude made by the
sects claiming to be Trotskyist. These objective factors are the main reason for
the weakness of the revolutionary current. The destruction and degeneration of
the self-styled &quot;Trotskyist&quot; cliques was a consequence of this period.
They have become more and more remote, with not the slightest possibility of
becoming mass working class organisations.</p>

<p>Even as a tradition Trotskyism
was largely obliterated in this period. What in the main attracted radical
moving petit-bourgeois were the ideas of Castroism and Guevarism. Left
opposition in the CP frustrated by the out and out reformist degeneration of the
leadership, tended to move in this direction, not only in the colonial or
ex-colonial World but in the industrialised countries with powerful working
classes also.</p>


<h4>The European Revolution has Begun</h4>

<p>Now the world situation is
changing. There has been an accumulation of deep contradictions. We are now in a
period of upheavals, sharp changes and sudden turns in all continents and all
countries.</p>

<p>The World recession of 1974-5
has been far deeper than any of the small slumps in the post war period. <em>For
the first time mass unemployment has appeared in all the countries of the OECD
simultaneously and the recession is practically universal in the industrially
developed countries.</em></p>

<p>The rate of profit has fallen in
all these countries, as has the amount of investment. With the collapse of the
illusion of permanent enrichment of &quot;all classes&quot;, the universal
inflation and now the economic recession, has come a sobering up of the
capitalists (and the reflection of their ideas in the theories of the CP, left
and right reformists, Mandel and the IS as to the possibilities of the
capitalists over-coming their problems &quot;by state expenditure&quot; (Mandel)
or the &quot;Permanent Arms economy&quot; (Cliff) etc.) and the beginning of
panic within the ruling class and their strategists.</p>

<p>Never before in history with the
world balance of forces against them, because of the colonial revolution, the
power of Russia, and China, and the most potent factor of all, the crushing
potential power of the world working class, have the strategists and
representatives of capital been so afraid of the future course of events.</p>


<p>One of the key factors in the
development of revolution is the demoralisation of the ruling class itself. Now
in the decisive countries of capitalism, splits and fissures are opening up in
the ruling class. They look with dread to the processes taking place in Europe
and the World. The most powerful of all, the United States capitalists, who
looked towards a century of world domination, and being the policeman of the
colonial and capitalist countries, are as demoralised as the rest.</p>

<p>The defeat in Indo-China against
the (deformed) war of national and social liberation is the first defeat in war
of American Imperialism. Despite the expenditure of staggering amounts of money
in arms and aid to their puppets of $300,000 million over 15 years, they had to
retreat despite all the devilish ingenuity of scientific devices, of chemical
and bacteriological weapons, the most concentrated and sustained amount of
bombing in tonnage and number of any war, including the Second World War: they
had to retreat.</p>

<p>This was because of the
resistance of the peasant masses, which triggered off the resistance and
opposition of the American people. The American Army became even more
demoralised than the Tzarist army of 1917! Had there existed a mass
revolutionary party in America this position and the defeat in the war would
have led to a revolutionary situation as did a similar unsuccessful war by the
weakest of the Imperialist powers, Portugal.</p>

<p>But American Imperialism had to
accept retreat with a gnashing of teeth, in a situation of 8 to 10 million
unemployed, the greatest number in the post-war period. Symbolic of the
situation was the episode of the Mayaguez. Unable to intervene any longer
against the revolution (even if distorted) in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, <em>because
of the opposition of the masses of the American people</em>, (middle class and
awakening workers) they took their revenge, bringing to bear their enormous
power, on this trifling issue of a seized ship which could have been easily
settled diplomatically. This was at the cost of 40 to 50 lives of American
marines. It was similar to the slinking away of the British naval destroyer
Amethyst from the Yangtse river in 1949 as the Chinese Red Army occupied the
Chinese coast, which the British capitalists headlined in the press as a
victory. But at least that cost no blood.</p>

<p>The American ruling class, the
most powerful, but the most ignorant, of all the bourgeoisies of the major
capitalist countries, wanted to show the jingos and hysterical sections of the
patriotic petit-bourgeoisie, that they still possessed enormous power and could
use it when necessary. It is like the hunter who turns tail from a lion and then
shows his prowess by swatting a fly! In reality the ruling class of America has
largely exhausted itself in the jungles of Vietnam and was therefore incapable
of intervening with military force against the Greek, and especially the
Portuguese revolution. This, despite the discreet and covert suggestions of the
European imperialists behind the scenes. In effect the American imperialists
reply in the rude vernacular was &quot;after you, Jack!&quot;</p>

<p>The development of revolution in
the European Mediterranean is only a dress rehearsal for similar developments in
all the countries of European capitalism. Long before the Utopian and
reactionary dream of a European super-state (EEC Economic, Monetary, and
Political integration into a single state, which in any event has not the
remotest chance of being carried through to the end) reaches fruition, all these
states will go through revolutionary convulsions. The paralysis of the Italian
ruling class for 5 years of unprecedented <em>pre-revolutionary crisis</em>, is
because they have been afraid of provoking the revolutionary intervention of the
masses, against any open move towards military dictatorship. <em>For 2 or 3 years</em>
- a longer period than Mussolini between 1920-22, the Neo-Fascists have
conducted their provocations against the working class parties and trade
unionists. In numbers they are stronger than the bands of lumpen proletarians,
petit-bourgeois and even some backward workers, of the thugs and hooligans of
Mussolini.</p>

<p>They have had the same
co-operation from the ministers of the Christian Democratic coalition
governments (as they would in a Popular Front Government) as did Mussolini from
its forerunner, the Catholic Popular Party. The Ministers of Justice and the
Interior, the heads of the armed forces and the police have acted hand in glove
with the Fascist conspiracy. The assassins and armed bands of the MSI and even
more crazed groups have murdered, bombed and assassinated almost with impunity.
They have done so with the full collaboration of the forces of the state.</p>

<p>Yet the pre-revolutionary
situation has lingered. It has not changed into a revolutionary situation
because of the policies of the leadership of the working class parties and trade
unions, who have paralysed the initiative of the masses and frittered away their
energies with a stream of 24 hour and shorter national and general strikes,
against the provocations of the fascists. In this they repeat the mistakes of
their predecessors which prepared the way for the victory of the fascists.</p>

<p><em>Yet this situation is
different.</em> This is shown by the aims of the Fascist rabble in their attempt
to organise anarchy and chaos in Italy. It is not as with Mussolini - <em>Power
for the Fascists</em> - but the creation of conditions for the intervention of
the army and a military coup d'etat. Bankers and industrialists have declared
that the situation is &quot;intolerable&quot; and spoken openly of the need for
a military coup to &quot;restore order&quot; - i.e. destroy the rights and
organisations of the working class.</p>


<p>Everything is ready...yet the
generals have procrastinated. They fear the army will break in their hands. The
conscripted workers and peasants in uniform will not accept a military
dictatorship.</p>

<p>The working class in Italy, as
in all Europe, is a thousand times stronger than pre-war. The ruling class is
enfeebled in numbers and strength. The relationship of forces between the
capitalists, petit-bourgeoisie and proletariat is far more favourable to the
latter. The working class in numbers, cohesion and social role has a dominating
position in Italian and European society (and even in the colonial and
semi-colonial countries). Thus the denouement in Italy is constantly postponed
by the representatives of capital, because they fear it would provoke a
counter-movement on the part of the proletariat and a situation like that of
Spain in July 1936, with an even more unfavourable environment for capitalism
nationally and internationally. But ultimately, the ruling class will have to
stake everything on crushing the workers. They are looking for a favourable
opportunity, possibly after a Popular Front has revealed its incapacity to solve
the problems of the Italian people. At a time of the ebbing of the workers'
movement or possibly even of a renewed offensive, under the shelter of the
Popular Front, the military and capitalist conspiracy may unfold.</p>

<p>A new period in European and
World history opens up with the collapse of the military-police dictatorship in
Greece and Portugal and the coming fall of the Franco regime in Spain. Trotsky's
anticipation of a revolutionary wave arising out of World War 2 was realised in
enormous movements of the proletariat in Eastern and Western Europe, and
revolutionary reverberations in a continuous sequence in the colonial world.</p>

<p>Then the frustration of the
revolution by the Stalinists and reformists in Western Europe, laid the
political basis for the economic upswing and this in turn led to the further
consolidation of Stalinism in Russia, Eastern Europe and China. The economic
upswing of Western capitalism was on a higher level than in any other historical
period, but nevertheless it marked the coming of twilight to World capitalism.
The potential power of the world working class has increased to a level never
before seen in history. Despite, and in a sense because of the boom, the
vitality of world capitalism has been sapped. The scandal of pollution, the
decay of the bourgeois mores in relation to the family, the primitive revolt of
the youth, the movement to the left of students which has been a world
phenomenon; all these are indications of the crisis of bourgeois society which
challenge the very existence of capitalism.</p>

<p>The first universal and deep
recession since the war has shaken capitalism to its foundations. The plague of
mass unemployment in most countries has only temporarily slackened inflation.
These twin evils, at a time of unparalleled technical, scientific and productive
capacity are shaking the foundations of capitalism.</p>

<p>The awakening to national
consciousness of the colonial peoples has, despite the technical and military
superiority of the capitalist powers over them rendered impotent the imperialist
powers. To quell this movement America undertook the role of military gendarme
in Vietnam, after the defeat of France, and suffered a mortifying reversal.</p>

<p>Now the imperialists have been
unable to intervene against the colonial revolution or what is even a greater
threat, the revolution in Portugal and Spain.</p>

<p>Even before the coming wave of
revolution the confidence of the bourgeoisie in the vitality and permanence of
their system has disappeared. They regard with pessimism the world outlook.</p>

<p>It is appropriate that the
strongest imperialism and the weakest one - the Portuguese - were both
placed in a blind alley by colonial wars.</p>


<p>The disintegration of the armies
of both powers was an expression of the end of the progressive side of
capitalism which was manifested in the past, even if it was maintained with
bloody and reactionary means.</p>

<p>The Greek revolution and that of
Portugal, with the impending collapse of the Franco regime, will see <em>in
capitalist Europe for the first time for 300 years, not a single military-police
dictatorship or autocratic rule.</em></p>

<p>This is not an expression of
strength, as might appear at first sight, but of debilitating weakness.</p>

<p>The enormous social, economic
and political significance of this fact is that it is because of the pressure of
the proletariat which has accumulated an over-whelming potential might. If
capitalism has a basis in Western Europe this is only because of the complete
blindness, pessimism, cowardice, downright stupidity, and lack of perspective of
the leadership of the proletariat. In a period of decay and futility of the
ruling class they have become bound up with the apparatus and state machine of
the democratic facade of capitalism. The Trade Union, Communist Party, and
Socialist Party leaders have, in the period of &quot;prosperity&quot; lost all
confidence in the power and capacity of the working class. Having raised
themselves above the working class, they regard them with contempt, and are
consequently searching for compromises with the ruling class.</p>

<p>The strategists of capital have
a far keener understanding of the period facing the system, because of the
forces slumbering in the depths of the proletariat. That is why they regard with
foreboding the coming clashes between labour and capital in all capitalist
countries.</p>

<p>The contradictions have been
piling up in the last decades. The main contradictions have been between the
power of the working class and the perfidious policies of the leadership of the
proletariat. The objective possibilities for the overthrow of capitalism and
Stalinism are reaching a new and higher level. In the wave of revolutions that
are developing within Europe and the world the traditional organisations of the
working class will be tested over and over again. <em>From within their ranks,
among the working class fighters will come the forces of Marxism-Leninism.
Outside of the mass organisations nothing of lasting substance will be created.</em></p>
