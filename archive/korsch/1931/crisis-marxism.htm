<p>Marxism today is in the midst of an historical and theoretical
crisis. It is not simply a crisis within the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Marxist movement</span>, but a
crisis of <span style="font-style: italic;">Marxism itself</span>.</p>
<p>This crisis reveals itself externally in the complete collapse of
the dominant position - partially illusory, but also partially real -
that Marxism held during the pre-World War I era in the European working
class movement. It reveals itself <span style="font-style: italic;">internally</span>
in the transformation of
Marxist theory and practice, a transformation which is most immediately
apparent in Marxists' altered position vis-&agrave;-vis their own
national state as well as with respect to the bourgeois system of national
states as a whole. It is deceptive and even false to see the
theoretical origins of the present crisis as resulting either from a
perversion or an oversimplification of Marx's and Engels' revolutionary
theory at the hands of their successors. It is equally misleading to
juxtapose this degenerated, falsified Marxism to the "pure theory" of
Marx and Engels themselves. In the final analysis, today's crisis is
the crisis of Marx's and Engels' theory as well. The ideological and
doctrinaire separation of "pure theory" from the real historical
movement, as well as the further development of theory, is itself an
expression of the present crisis.</p>
<h3>2</h3>
<p>The form of Marxism which is currently entering a critical stage was
a product of the second half of the nineteenth century. It was created
from elements of a theory which was itself formulated under earlier
historical conditions, conditions that differed fundamentally from
those of the late nineteenth century. These elements were actively
incorporated into the working class movement at a time when European
capitalism was not yet fully developed. And here is the genesis for the
separation of theory from practice inherent in the entire history of
Marxism. From its very beginning, this theory is never the "general
expression of existing class struggles." Rather, it is the composite
result of the class struggles of a previous historical era, and it
consequently lacks any real relation to contemporary class struggles
emerging as a result of wholly new conditions.</p>
<p>In the course of historical development, this separation of theory
from practice has widened rather than narrowed.</p>
<p>The three contemporary forms of Marxism -"revisionism," "orthodoxy"
and the periodic efforts to "restore" original revolutionary Marxism in
its pure form - are all based upon this separation. In the final
analysis, it is also the source of the present crisis.</p>
<h3>3</h3>
<p>After 1850 <span style="font-style: italic;">the altered historical
conditions of the new capitalist
epoch and of the working class movement </span>itself prevented the
further development of a living Marxist theory within the unfolding praxis of
the workers' movement.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">By the year 1850</span> the first
great cycle in the historical development
of capitalism had come to a close. During this cycle and on the basis
of its limited capacity at that time, capitalism had completed all
stages of its development to the point where the class-conscious sector
of the proletariat was in a position to place social revolution on the
historical agenda. Thus, on the limited economic basis of that period,
the <span style="font-style: italic;">class movement of the proletariat</span>
had reached a <span style="font-style: italic;">relatively high
level</span> of development. This development found practical
expression in
the revolutionary struggles of that period, and theoretical expression
in the early formulations of the so-called utopian socialists
concerning the content of proletarian class consciousness and the goals
of the proletarian revolution.</p>
<p>It was during this time and in the later development of their
theories, which resulted from the experiences of this period, that Marx
and Engels arrived at their <span style="font-style: italic;">twofold
theoretical achievement</span>. On the one
hand, they criticized all aspects of the existing class society
(economic basis and superstructure) from the newly acquired perspective
of the proletariat. In so doing, they appropriated unaltered the
<span style="font-style: italic;">content</span> of this new
proletarian class consciousness directly from the
reality of existing class struggles and as it was formulated
theoretically by the utopian socialists. Simultaneously, however, they
criticized the practice of the proletarian movement as well as the
theories of the utopian socialists. Drawing upon the highest
achievements of bourgeois science, they were able to conceptualize for
the proletarian class <span style="font-style: italic;">the real
developmental laws</span> of the existing
capitalist society and hence, at the same time, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">the real conditions for
revolutionary class actions</span>.</p>
<p>After 1850 and on an <span style="font-style: italic;">expanded
basis</span> (geographical, technological,
organizational), capitalism began a <span style="font-style: italic;">new
historical cycle</span> of its
development. Under these altered conditions, it was no longer possible
for the proletariat to <span style="font-style: italic;">draw directly</span>
upon Marxist theory in its
original form, a theory which had assumed its revolutionary character
under the conditions of a past historical epoch. During the 1870s - a
<span style="font-style: italic;">period of crisis and depression</span>
which was particularly conducive to the
development of class consciousness - the working class was able to
adopt this theory in a formal way. Yet even then it was unable to appropriate
completely its revolutionary content-either practically or
theoretically.</p>
<h3>4</h3>
<p>The Marxist theory appropriated by the European workers' movement in
the second half of the nineteenth century had partially altered its
original revolutionary character during the reception process itself. </p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">materialist view of history</span>
grew out of a revolutionary period
prior to 1850 as an integral part of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">subjective action</span> of a
revolutionary class, which continually criticizes in theory and
overthrows in practice the false illusions and transient appearances of
all existing social relationships. In the succeeding period, it
developed into a purely abstract and passive theory dealing with the
<span style="font-style: italic;">objective course</span> of social
development as determined by external laws.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Marxist economy</span> was
originally formulated as a radical <span style="font-style: italic;">critique</span>
of bourgeois political economy, a critique which was to have found both
theoretical and practical culmination in a real revolution. This
original schema was later changed by Marx and altered even more by
Engels. Today the apologists as well as the critics of Marxism view
<span style="font-style: italic;">Marxist economics</span> as little
more than a <span style="font-style: italic;">scientific system</span>
in which all economic phenomena of bourgeois society are deduced theoretically from
an uncritical, axiomatic concept of "value." Marx's revolutionary
critique of political economy aimed at the theoretical and
practical sublation (<span style="font-style: italic;">Aufhebung</span>) of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">fetishism</span>. But fetishism has become
the idol of Marxist scientific economists and a thorn in the side of bourgeois
and reformist critics of Marxism.</p>
<p>Having been absorbed by the modern working class as mere ideology,
Marxist science completely ceased developing as a living theory after
the death of Marx, Engels and the first generation of their direct
disciples. During this period the leading representatives of
revolutionary principles in the Marxist parties were forced to fight a
defensive battle against the increasingly dominant trend towards
reformist theory and practice. At the same time, they opposed any
attempts to revitalize the theoretical expression of proletarian class
struggle. Confronted with the threat of bourgeois falsifications of
traditional Marxist theory, they tended to view their own stagnation as
the lesser of two evils. (See Rosa Luxemburg's article "Stillstand und
Fortschritt im Marxismus" ["Stagnation and Progress within Marxism"].)
At this time the most important impetus for further developing the
theory of proletarian class struggle came from three different
directions, each of which consciously and unconsciously stood opposed
to orthodox Marxist theory. These three were: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">unionist reformism,
revolutionary syndicalism and Leninist Bolshevism</span>. Despite vast
differences, all three shared one common tendency. In one way or
another, each attempted to make the subjective action of the working
class rather than the objective development of capitalism the main
focus of socialist theory. In this regard, all three appear as
progressive tendencies within the development of the working class
movement and simultaneously as the forerunners of that proletarian
class theory and practice which was to develop on a new historical
basis.</p>
<h3>6<a href="#01">[1]</a></h3>
<p>From this overview of the historical origins and determinants of the
current Marxist crisis, several conclusions emerge which point to ways
for overcoming it.</p>
<p>None of the current trends in Marxism stands as an adequate
theoretical expression for the continued practical needs of the
proletarian class struggle-a struggle which, despite occasional defeat,
remains revolutionary in its means and its goals. Certainly so-called
"orthodox Marxism" provides the least adequate solution. Of all the
contemporary forms of Marxism, this is the most damaging to the
progressive development of the proletarian class. After having long
since stagnated into ideology, "orthodox Marxism" collapsed as such
(Kautsky) in its final phase. Today it is nothing but a hindrance
blocking the development of the theory and practice of the proletarian
class struggle.</p>
<p>The two other trends which are continuations of pre-World War I
Marxism are a different matter. From the perspective of the
revolutionary proletariat, neither the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">reformist state socialism</span> of the
social democratic parties nor <span style="font-style: italic;">communist
anti-imperialism</span> can be written
off simply as reactionary movements. The relationship of today's
proletariat to the social democratic parties and the Communist Party is
virtually identical to the relationship of the proletarian class as a
whole to the theory and practice of the radical, progressive bourgeois
party at that time in history when the European bourgeois class was
still relatively progressive.</p>
<p>It is an irrevocable fact of history that during and immediately
after World War I, the once revolutionary and anti-statist ideology of
social democratic Marxism as it existed in the most powerful <span
 style="font-style: italic;">core
nations of international capitalism</span> - the so-called imperialist
nations - was transformed into reformist state socialism. This is
analogous to the transformation of revolutionary, anti-statist
Christianity into the official religion of the Roman state during the
early Middle Ages.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are the struggles taking place in the
<span style="font-style: italic;">marginal areas of the international
capitalist system</span>, where capitalism
has not yet developed locally. The repressed and exploited classes of
these areas appear to be developing theories in their current struggles
which are contiguous with so-called Communism. These theories cannot
take up and continue old Marxism for two reasons: first, the older
theory is based on the triumph of capitalism over pre-capitalist
socio-economic formations and the advantageous relationship of this
stage of history to the proletarian class struggle; and secondly, old
Marxism proceeds from the immediate, positive relationship of the
bourgeois to the proletarian revolution. In these marginal areas the
relationship of the struggles of the proletarian class to those of the
indigenous and foreign bourgeoisie is different-not fundamentally, but
in its immediate form. These movements cannot seek connections with
reformism, since it is inseparably tied to the expansionist and
colonialist policies of the core nations of the world capitalist system
today. However, they will find in Leninist Bolshevism and Communism a
form of Marxist ideology which is strongly anti-imperialist. It could
be used as a transitional ideology for their own anti-imperialist class
struggle. Such a process would again be analogous to the spread of
Christianity among the barbarians outside the territories of the Roman
Empire.</p>
<h3>7</h3>
<p>Marxism as an historical phenomenon is a thing of the past. It grew
out of the revolutionary class struggles of the first half of the
nineteenth century, only to be maintained and re-shaped in the second
half of the nineteenth century as the revolutionary ideology of a
working class which had not yet regained its revolutionary force. Yet
in a more fundamental historical sense, the theory of proletarian
revolution, which will develop anew in the next period of history, will
be an historical continuation of Marxism. In their revolutionary
theory, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels gave the first great
summarization of proletarian ideas, in the first revolutionary period
of the proletarian class struggle. This theory remains for all time <span
 style="font-style: italic;">the classical expression of the new revolutionary consciousness of the
proletarian class fighting for its own liberation</span>.</p>
