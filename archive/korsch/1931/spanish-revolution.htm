<h3>I </h3>

<p>The last foreign minister of the fallen Spanish monarchy, Count
Romanones, reports that the overpowering victory of the republican
parties (who in the municipal elections of April 12, 1931, obtained the
overwhelming majority of votes in almost all - 47 out of 51! -
provincial capitals) and the fall of the Bourbon monarchy which
resulted in a few hours "was a surprise for all." And Leon Rollin,
correspondent of "New Europe," who is familiar with the most intimate
secrets of the Spanish opposition, has explicitly confirmed it. It was
a surprise for the king, who had wanted these elections "sincerismis"
(most sincerely) (and had at the same time providently transferred the
greatest part of his fortune across the border); it was a surprise for
the European press which still a few weeks ago had celebrated the last
Spanish autocrat during his short visit to Paris and London as the
"first politician of Spain." And it was a surprise also for the
victorious oppositionalists themselves who had only counted on victory
in the big cities and already had prepared for new revolutionary
action.</p>

<p>Instead of this, in one blow the whole old order collapsed without
any attempt at resistance. The hitherto most reliable pillars of the
monarchy, the army and the church, abandoned the king almost
immediately and put themselves at the disposal of the persecuted
&eacute;migr&eacute;s, the sentenced traitors of yesterday who formed
the revolutionary government of today. They offered the new government
the same traditional loyalty and fidelity with which already in 1808,
after the abdication of Ferdinand VII enforced by a Napoleon, a
deputation of the grandees of Spain addressed the new King Joseph put
on the throne by Napoleon: "Sire, the grandees of Spain have at all
times been famous for their loyalty to their sovereign, and your
majesty will also find in them the same fidelity and devotion." The
infamous chief of the monarchist Civil Guard, General Sanjurjo, did the
same. This general, who had changed over to the republic from the
monarchy immediately after its fall and was received with open arms by
the new republican power holders, is the same person who later at the
time of the Cartes elections suppressed, in the name of the
republican-conservative Interior Minister Maura, the alleged conspiracy
of the popular revolutionary hero Ramon Franco, and a month after that
the real general strike and insurrection of the urban and rural workers
in Seville and Andalusia. General Sanjurjo used such brutal measures
that the conservative English "Daily Mail" congratulated the
revolutionary Spanish government for its strength of character proven
on this occasion.</p>

<p>But all of this was still in the future in the beautiful spring days
of April. This revolution of April, 1931, was later gloriously
characterized by its leaders and eyewitnesses as more a fiesta than a
fight. This was indeed for the Spain of today the "beautiful
revolution," following the description by Karl Marx of the French
Revolution of 1848, which was followed even in the same year by the
social catastrophe of the June defeat of the Paris proletariat and on
December 2, 1851, by the coup d'etat of the third Napoleon. In Marx's
well-known characterization, written in the middle of the previous
century for revolutionary France, it was "the beautiful revolution, the
revolution of universal sympathy, because the conflicts which erupted
in the revolution against the monarch were underdeveloped and slumbered
side by side, because the social war, which formed its background, had
only developed in a lofty existence, the existence of the phrase, of
words."<a href="#01">[1]</a></p>

<p>Indeed it is striking how little, in these first months between the
municipal elections of April and the meeting of the constituent
assembly (Cortes) in July, the newly formed provisional government, so
aptly designated by the "Economist" as "republican-conservative and
moderate socialist," was concerned with the social and class demands of
the proletariat which required acute, practical immediate fulfilment.
There is a striking difference between the two last European
revolutions, which were unleashed in Russia in 1917 through the crisis
of the world war, and in Spain through the new "peaceful" world
economic crisis which has overtaken the world since the autumn of 1929.
This difference is partly explained by the basically changed general
European situation of today compared with the one of 1917-1920. It
depends, on the other hand, on the thoroughly peculiar character of the
Spanish workers' movement, which is not new but has already developed
for the past sixty years.</p>

<p>First of all, there was never and does not exist in Spain until this
day practically any Communist party. Neither are there signs that such
a party might emerge in the near future. There was a time when the
agricultural workers, vegetating in indescribable poverty in Andalusia
and Estremadura, and the permanently overworked peasants of Galicia and
Asturias, gaining from their tiny parcels of land a miserable support
and the hated rent ("fuero") for an unknown landowner, listened
attentively when they heard about the dividing up of the agricultural
soil in the Soviet Union. But all this today is long gone. What appears
today under the name of "communism" in the revolutionary movement in
Spain is, as the Cartes elections of June 28 should have proven even to
the foreign doubters, still only the shadow of a shadow. There are but
three weak Communist sects, which are fighting more amongst themselves,
and with the real revolutionary organizations of the Spanish
proletariat, than with the bourgeois class enemy. Of these, one follows
the orders of Stalin, the second those of Trotsky, while the third
group alone, the Catalonian Federalist Communists led by the Spaniard
Maurin, can be looked upon as a relatively home-grown product of the
Spanish labor movement. None of these three directions exerts an
effective practical influence within the Spanish labor movement. None
of them is represented in the Cortes even by one single deputy.</p>

<p>However, the two branches of the workers' movement to be found in
Spain which are also strong social forces have not in these first
months dimmed the happy spring morning of the young Spanish revolution
through an all too radical mounting of their particular class demands.
It is not surprising that one of these two directions, the Social
Democratic reformist party and union movement, has refused to raise
these radical demands in the light of its whole statesmanlike and
state-maintaining tradition, formed already during the pre-war period.
But it must appear strange and surprising, to the highest degree for
the other direction, the syndicalist revolutionary movement, not to
have raised radical demands, in the light of the whole historical
character of this movement. "If one looks at the workers' movement
south of the Pyrenees only from the viewpoint of threats it contains to
social peace, then the danger does not appear to come so much from
socialism as from anarchism; of course less under the ideological form
which it still had a few years ago, and in the platonic theories to
which some survivors of the International may still commit themselves,
and not even in the individual deeds of a number of fanatics, but
rather from the new point of view of revolutionary syndicalism through
which it can reorganize itself."</p>

<p>This historical prognosis, which was put forward by the bourgeois
social politician Angel Marvaud in 1910, has been confirmed by the real
development to a surprising degree. Today, after twenty years of
further development of Spanish social democracy, which from its
beginning represented a tendency of state preservation, and after the
success accelerated by the war of the same state maintaining tendency
in all other European social democratic parties also, the Spanish
social democratic party stands, in spite of its extremely small number
of members, with its 130 mandates as the strongest party in the
constituent national assembly (Cartes). With its three ministers it is
directly participating in the new bourgeois-republican governmental
power, and even within this governing coalition, it is only still
formally on the left wing, while in actual fact, however, it is much
more on the right. It stands to the right of the radical
bourgeois-revolutionary tendency which is represented in the present
cabinet by the foreign minister Lerroux. And it stands far to the right
of the federalist republican parties in Catalonia, Andalusia, and
Galicia, in particular to the right of the popular-federalist party of
the Catalonian state president Macia, who still to this day opposes in
his area all demagogical instructions of the Madrid guardians of order
with a stiff-necked and successful resistance.</p>

<p>The most glaring illustration of this character of today's Spanish
governing socialists is provided by the fact that its leader, Largo
Caballero, the present republican labor minister and at the same time
chairman of the Social Democratic National Trade Union (UGT), possesses
the dubious fame that he had already under the dictatorship of Primo de
Rivera participated in the government as a state councillor. At a time
when the whole radical bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, and the
revolutionary part of the working class fought with all means the
unconstitutional regime of the dictatorship, and even the liberal and
conservative ex-minister from the pre-dictatorship period boycotted the
dictator and all his undertakings, there was a Spanish party loyal to
the government, and that was the Spanish Social Democrats. They
supported even the so-called joint committees (a kind of arbitration
committee) which had been introduced by the dictator in imitation of
Mussolini's labor-charter, and used the thus created indirect
governmental organization for the coerced formation of a factual
monopoly benefiting these hitherto relatively weak trade unions in
their fight to eliminate the syndicalist trade unions prohibited and
prosecuted by the dictatorship.</p>

<p>The fall of the dictatorship and the monarchy did likewise change
this condition very little and not at all to the advantage of the
revolutionary section of workers. The "joint-committees" of the
dictator are still retained by the republic unchanged today, as are the
direct measures of repression which the present "revolutionary"
government applies to striking syndicalist workers through the
Sanjurjos and Pistoleros they inherited from the dictatorship. But
they serve much less the general purpose of a "defense of the state"
than the much more palpable task of strengthening the reformist trade
unions of the republican minister of labor Largo Caballero, who is also
a reformist trade union secretary, through the renewed suppression of
the syndicalist trade unions of the National Federation of Labor (CNT).</p>

<p>The aversion of the present Spanish social democratic party to
energetically pursue any revolutionary proletarian class demands goes
so far that the party considered their victory in the Cortes elections
as being most inopportune. In accordance with a secret plan of the
coalition parties, the Social Democrats were meant to be the opposition
in the constituting National Assembly-now this role will perhaps be
taken on by the right wing after some time. The socialists would have
rather not been further participants in a bourgeois coalition
government for a considerable period since by nature the freshly
turned-over revolutionary ground calls for a new positioning of
societal forces at great speed. Now, however, after their surprisingly
large electoral victory, they had to be satisfied with announcing their
categorical rejection of participating in a bourgeois government while
simultaneously directing the three socialist ministers to remain on
their posts until the final promulgation of the new constitution. In
fact they can count themselves lucky in not having gained the absolute
majority in the elections, for the discrepancy between their socialist
talk and bourgeois deeds would have been much more embarrassing. And
the pressure of the masses to part company with the bourgeois
politicians and follow the course of the social revolution of the
proletarian class would have assailed them with much greater force.</p>

<p>The tactics employed by the other line of the Spanish workers'
movement were far more noteworthy than this "moderate" bearing of the
Social Democrats during the initial developmental phase of the Spanish
revolution now already coming, or so it seems, to an end. Anyone who in
these weeks spent some time among the revolutionary workers of Spain
and observed not only their theoretical programmes, but more so their
practical activities and actual stance toward the new situation brought
about by the April revolution, could not help considering the following
impressions: perhaps there was a newly founded consciousness of power,
or as I would rather suppose, the newly won freedom of movement was
naively seen as a new era that would continue undisturbed after so many
years of oppression. In any case, this whole great mass of workers,
after sixty years of revolutionary propaganda and direct action, and a
recent eight-year period of immensely accelerated powerful oppression
from which they arose to a new life, was, nonetheless, still
fanatically bound to their old revolutionary goals even today. Although
they were still independent, active, and prepared for any sacrifice, at
this one historical moment they never thought to wage from the
beginning the "open warfare" against this new republican state that
they theoretically declared against every form of state, with their
traditional vigor or with still increased severity at the end. The
bourgeois republic corresponded in no way to their programmatical
demands; it only provided the momentary release from an immense
pressure and compliance with some small but humanly practical and
important wishes such as the freeing of their prisoners, a pause for
breath in the never-ending persecution and a partial recognition of
their organizations. Thus the revolutionary workers did not immediately
oppose the new republic in a hostile manner, but were first and
foremost concerned with consolidating their revolutionary mass
organization, the syndicalist CNT, which had, after almost complete
destruction, in less than two months gained a strength of 600,000
members and was still rapidly increasing its members, as well as
looking after all other possible centers, so as to fashion a really
free and autonomous worker's life in accord with their concept. When in
mid-June they gathered in Madrid 432 delegates from all parts of Spain,
representing industrial and rural workers, for their first national
congress, they affirmed their traditional principles and expressly
stated that this congress of the CNT "regards and will relate to the
constituting Cortes as it would to every oppressing power." At the same
time, however, they put forward a plan of minimum demands which they
directed to this same Cortes, concerning those areas of social life
they considered at this time as most important, namely: education and
the school system ("as long as the state exists, one has to demand that
the evil of analphabetism be eliminated!"), the freedom of the
individual, freedom of speech and the press, the right of coalition and
strike, the elimination of unemployment in city and country, and the
breaking of the narrow bourgeois property concepts where they hinder
the fulfilment of these productive demands.</p>

<p>One notices at first sight that among these demands there is not one
which could not have been managed by a radical bourgeois and democratic
revolution that was true to its own principles. In fact, there was not
one demand that has not been recognized even by the liberal monarchists
of the pre-revolutionary regime as theoretically justifiable. But
nevertheless, at this hour not a single one of these demands has been
fulfilled in revolutionary Spain, nor is their fulfillment being
seriously considered. The provisional government, aghast at a definite
and immediate break with the old powers, already during its first hour
was concerned to again fetter, in concert with these old powers, as
quickly as possible, this freedom-movement of the revolutionary forces
created unavoidably in the movement of violent overthrow. It took
advantage of the strike of telephone workers, beginning on July 6th in
Barcelona as, at first, a mere trade union matter, later followed by
strikes of solidarity in the remaining parts of the country, to provoke
the uprising in Seville and the whole of Andalusia. It then put down
this movement with brutal force and on July 24, 1931, ultimately
prohibited by decree the syndicalist organizations in all of Spain, and
thereby put the syndicalist movement "outside the law." With this
complete return to the methods of the old militarist-reactionary system
of suppression, the provisional government of the new Spanish state
has, as it wished and intended, prevented the ongoing tendencies of a
proletariat dissatisfied with the bourgeois revolution. Thereby and at
the same time, it also impeded immensely the progress toward those
immediate tasks recognized by itself, and which are regarded today, by
the overwhelming majority of all classes of the Spanish people, as not
postponable.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The immediate tasks of the present bourgeois revolution in Spain are
above all the following: (1) creation of a new form of state which will
at once maintain a large uniform economic area commensurate with the
development of modern production and will satisfy the stormy and
relentless demand of Catalonians, Galicians, and Basques for autonomous
government of their own affairs in the fields of education, culture,
public works, transport, law and police. (2) The immediate and complete
separation of church and state, church and school, together with a
return (without compensation) of those mobile and immobile goods of the
people that are today possessed by the church: several thousand
monasteries, and other institutions of the dead hand. Finally (3) the
chief and central task - on the solution to which in all great
revolutions of the last centuries the whole development, victory or
defeat of the revolutionary principle decisively depended, from the
great French Revolution of 1789 to the great Russian Revolution of
1917-the core task is and was in all cases the implementation of the
agrarian revolution. The unsuccessful solution to this task already
caused the last Spanish revolution of 1868 to fail and the Spanish
republic of 1873 likewise to expire.</p>

<p>Of all the questions, as they stand today and fill the agenda of the
Spanish revolution, the relatively easiest one to answer is that of
so-called federalism. When viewed superficially from outside, it
appears as a catastrophic danger to the new republican statehood when
the Madrid central government (where there are also some followers of
federalist Catalonia In. the parliament!) now permits the constituting
Cortes not only to submit a unitarian, but an extremely centralist
constitutional concept, and when at the same time the Catalonian
"State-President" Macia arranged in his area a formal plebiscite which
determined with an overwhelming majority, almost unanimous, a quite
different concept of the constitution for the united Catalonian
provinces, namely the so-called Catalonian Statute. But already the
British "Economist" points to, and rightfully so, the extraordinary
watering down of privileges which had actually been demanded in this
statute "for the independent Catalonian State within the Spanish
Republic," and which would not even measure up to what in the unwritten
constitution of the British Empire is called "dominion status." And
another prosaic Englishman calls what is presently formed under the
name of "Generalidad de Catalunya" (as a cross between a state and a
mere utilitarian association of provinces), in a highly disrespectful
manner, "a kind of glorified county-council."</p>

<p>Be that as it may, one sees that the former extreme separatist Macia
and his followers have already dampened their original demands for
independence to a high degree. The stick lies with the dog. It is not
accidental that the Catalonian state leaves to the central Spanish
state authorities such matters as foreign relations, declarations of
war, and post, as well as "indirect taxes and custom's duty." The
Catalonian bourgeoisie is well aware that just because Catalonia is
industrially the most developed region of Spain, it will also in the
future be dependent on the total Spanish market for the sale of their
products which today are secured by high tariffs, Already several
decades ago the well-known revolutionary ideologist Miguel de Unamuno
accused the Catalonian bourgeoisie in a similar situation, that during
their negotiations for Catalonian autonomy, "they had exchanged their
soul for a custom tariff."</p>

<p>On the other hand, through this intelligent moderation of the
Catalonian demands, the Madrid central government is put in a position
where it can hardly refuse its agreement to this quite acceptable
proposal. When it hitherto has done so, when Madrid and Barcelona today
oppose each other apparently on this question like two enemy camps,
then it is in this case not merely a formal political controversy of
principles. The concern here is not just a more general contrast
between a backward servile and bureaucratic and courtly atmosphere of
Madrid and the quite different atmosphere of Catalonia, which is not
only industrially, but also socially much further developed (where
incidentally the working class takes up a quite different position in
public life than anywhere else in Spain since here it follows
indivisibly the revolutionary syndicalist and anarchist line). The
prohibition of syndicalist organizations decreed by the Madrid central
government for the whole of Spain is in Catalonia to this day
officially and actually being ignored.</p>

<p>Far more critical for the continuation of the Spanish revolution
than the controversy between centralism and federalism is the
unavoidable struggle between the old republican state and the real
reactionary main force of the old monarchist Spain, the Catholic
church. It is not as if the church were opposing the new republican
state power with any kind of open enmity; quite to the contrary, the
Catholic church (which has been until the fall of the dictator Primo de
Rivera a loyal follower of the dictatorial regime and until the
overthrow of Alphonse XIII, a true ally of the monarchy) put herself
firmly behind the new republican state right from the day of the
collapse of the monarchy. She did not even withdraw her fullest
confidence from a government that had condoned the storming of
monasteries in May, a government in which two loyal sons of the
Catholic church served in the most important functions (the
minister-president Aleala Zamora and the minister of the interior
Miguel Maura). And when the reactionary Archbishop of Toledo, the
infamous Cardinal Segura, had to flee Spanish soil due to a careless
statement, it was the Bishop of Taranza who immediately referred
Spanish Catholics by means of a pastoral letter to the young German
republic, where Catholicism bloomed as peacefully as had never been the
case under the Kaisers.</p>

<p>Yet just in this prudent conforming by the church to its defeat,
suffered with the fall of the Catholic monarchist state order, there
lies one of the greatest dangers for the future development of the
Spanish revolution. Both as a national Spanish and international
European power, the Catholic church very soon after the critical
twelfth of April has begun a masterly battle of retreat, which at the
same time already bore the seeds for a new attack. The Catholic party
was the first and the only one of those old parties defeated in the
April 12 elections who gathered together their followers and a large
section of former monarchists (as well as their leading newspaper "El
Debater" and their parliamentary group "Accion National") for the
elections to the constituting Cartes on June 28. At the same time, it
organized immediately on an international scale all leading Catholic
newspapers of Europe in a unified defensive campaign against the
alarming secularization of the new republican affairs of state in
Catholic Spain: the "Vie Intellectuelle" of the French Dominicans, the
"Correspondent" of the Catholic school "Montalernbert," the "Etudes" of
the Jesuits, the "Vita e Pensiero" edited by scholars of the Milan
Catholic University and the German "Hochland." The tendency represented
today by all these modern Catholic newspapers is best expressed by "Vie
Intellectuelle" which clearly and succinctly characterized on May 10
the emerging new situation: "It is said that the church has lost the
battle. It is said too rashly. At worst she has lost a battle not of
her own making, but rather that of her ally, the monarchy. Now there
will be a battle to be fought, and this time in her own domain-and that
is the battle of democracia cristiana. One must compare this with the
declaration given by the present minister-president, Aleala Zamora,
during the first days following the setting up of the new republic: "It
is imperative that we have the cooperation of the elements of order, of
capitalism, and the clergy, because without them the republic would be
ephemeral and ultimately doomed, since her failure would infinitely
protract the possibility of stabilizing this regime." Thus one can
build up a sufficiently clear picture of one of the possible ways in
which the republic can develop and will develop, when the radical break
with the reactionary power, so far strenuously being avoided by the
present republican powers, is not in the course of events violently
enforced and accomplished by new and stronger societal forces.</p>

<p>The only form in which one can expect the unleashing of such new
societal forces in today's condition of the Spanish revolution-which,
however, is already clearly indicated by the recent revolutionary
upheavals in Andalusia-is the confrontation with the agrarian question
pending now by historical necessity-and it probably will take this
form. One would have to write a separate essay if one were to sketch
merely an approximate picture of the most miserable and suppressed
position of the Spanish rural workers and the so-called independent
small holders, whose hopeless misery indeed equals that of the landless
workers. Or, of the monstrous contrast between the giant estates of the
large property owners and the slavish life of the farm workers
("braceros"), spiced still with regularly occurring periods of endless
unemployment, of their ever and again flaring and desperate revolts
being crushed bloodily time and time again, of the waste and retarded
growth of the agricultural production capacity thus conditioned. All
parties representing the public consciousness of Spain have unanimously
recognized these unbearable conditions for a very long time. But all
well-meaning projects of reform have repeatedly come to nothing against
the thousand secret and open obstructions whim were bound to arise in a
country where the king, the officer-corps, the church and the leaders
of the pseudo-parliamentary government parties of the ever-changing
restoration period 1876-1923 were all rooted to their whole being, with
all their power and privileges and emoluments in huge land estates.</p>

<p>All these forces, and their willing instruments, ruled society
officially and unofficially: the ordinary countryside and the little
and middle-sized towns were exploited by brutal profiteering for
personal interest and the infamous "kaziks" who prepared the ground for
election on behalf of the governing men in Madrid. All agrarian
conditions in Spain have thus been resting for five hundred years now
in one and the same disconsolate immutability, whim in recent times has
become all the more pressing and inflammatory due to the manifold
scientific and experiental evidence for the technical possibilities and
economic productivity of a radical reform. Apart from this we must
recognize the fact that a progressive industrial development has only
taken place in a few provinces in the east and northeast, and that
agricultural production in Spain therefore determines the whole
economic and social life of the nation to a far different degree than
in the industrially developed countries. The agrarian problem therefore
is of immense significance to the fate of the present Spanish
revolution. At the same time one could guess the fatal and ultimately
insoluble problems a revolutionary government is confronted with when
it meekly avoids any interference with dusty medieval privileges
instead of solving this great problem with fortitude and disregard. And
one can see, as the present "provisional government" has, that the
first minute and insufficient projects toward social reform can only be
won during and after an already progressing agrarian revolt which this
government suppressed by bloody repression.</p>

<p>We cannot any better characterize the circumstances into which the
provisional government of the Spanish republic is already today visibly
deeper and deeper enmeshed than by recapitulating the description given
by an open enemy of this government, who is at the same time one of
Spain's largest landowners, Count Romanones, who wrote in the article
in the "Revue des Deux Mondes" which we have already mentioned:</p>

<p>In the last instance it will not be the big cities which will force
their guidelines on this new political order but rather the country.
People in the country are less interested in the political regime than
in the question of distribution of the land. And it is among the day
workers in the fields where we find the greatest threat of the present
hour.</p>

<p>The rural agitation, particularly in the Andalusian provinces, must
not be neglected when one knows how to apprehend the lessons of
history. What happened in the provinces between 1870-92, with "the
Black Hand," a kind of Mafia of Camorra organization in the south of
Spain, with the rising of rural workers in Jerez, with the convulsions
of Cordoba, Espejo, Montjlla, etc; all these events will repeat
themselves now with greater destructive force. The mentality of the
Spanish rural populace is the same today as it was sixty years ago; the
economic conditions of their life have not changed for the better and
the means for containing them are weaker than yesterday. This rural
populace is less isolated than half a century ago. It is in contact
with its brothers in the cities, and is in some places organized in
societies with most extreme convictions, and is far more inclined
towards violent and tumultuous action than in 1873. Neither does this
require any goading from Moscow; their souls have already experienced
frightful storms before the winds of Russia blew over them; not only
can the Soviet propaganda induce them to an uprising but it is rather
their own tendency, developed through the social conditions under which
they have lived for centuries.</p>

<p>As far as these well chosen words, fitting for more than one
purpose, of Count Romanones are only a characterization of the present
actually pertaining situation, we need not add anything. If, however,
the unspoken purpose of his description is to frighten the hesitant and
indecisive statesmen of the republic with these terrifying difficulties
of fulfilling their task, then one must say that such a task as the
radical solution to the agrarian problem in present-day Spain cannot be
conjured away by little diplomatic tricks and playful magic - the more
so when the task is clearly situated in the whole objective situation
and is regarded with urgency by the overwhelming majority of all the
people's classes. Whether those men who were called to the leadership
of the first phase of the Spanish revolution through the election of
April 12 and June 28 wish to further or hinder it, the starting point
and content of the second phase of this revolution will nevertheless be
the struggle over the agrarian revolution.</p>
