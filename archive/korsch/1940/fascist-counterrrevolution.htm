<p>What hope have we revolutionary Marxists, remnants of a past
epoch, inheritors of its most advanced theories, illusions,
ideologies-what hope have we left for a revolutionary turn of the
sweeping counterrevolutionary movement of victorious fascism? The fate
of France has finally proved that the old Marxist slogan of "world
revolution" has in our epoch assumed a new meaning. We find ourselves
today in the midst not of a socialist and proletarian but of an
ultra-imperialistic and fascist world revolution. Just as in the
preceding epoch every major defeat-the defeat of France in 1871, that
of Russia, Germany, Hungary in 1905, 1917, 1918-resulted in a genuine
revolution, so in our time each defeated country resorts to a fascist
counterrevolution. Moreover, present-day war itself has become a
revolutionary process, a civil war with an unmistakably predominant
counterrevolutionary tendency. Just as in a horse race we do not know
which horse will win but we do know that it will be a horse, so in the
present war the victory of either party will result in a further
gigantic step toward the fascization of Europe, if not of the whole
European, American, Asiatic world of tomorrow.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>There seem to be two easy ways for the "orthodox" Marxist of
today to handle this difficult problem. Well-trained in Hegelian
philosophical thought, he might say that all that is, is reasonable,
and that, by one of those dialectical shifts in which history rejoices,
socialism has been fulfilled by the social revolution implied in the
victory of fascism. Thus Hegel himself at first followed the rising
star of the French Revolution, later embraced the cause of Napoleon,
and ended by acclaiming the Prussian state that emerged from the
anti-Napoleonic wars of 1812-1815 as the fulfilment of the
philosophical "idea" and as the "state of reason" corresponding to the
given stage of its historical development.</p>

<p>Or, for that matter, our orthodox Marxist might not be
willing, for the present, to go so far as to acknowledge the fascist
allies of Stalin as the genuine promoters of socialism in our time. He
would then content himself with feeling that the victory of fascism,
planned economy, state capitalism, and the weeding out of all ideas and
institutions of traditional "bourgeois democracy" will bring us to the
very threshold of the genuine social revolution and proletarian
dictatorship - just as, according to the teachings of the early church,
the ultimate coming of Christ will be immediately preceded by the
coming of the Anti-Christ who will be so much like Christ in his
appearance and in his actions that the faithful will have considerable
difficulty in seeing the difference.</p>

<p>In so reasoning, our orthodox Marxist would not only conform
with the church but would also keep well in line with the precedents
set by the earlier socialists and "revolutionary" Marxists themselves.
It was not only the moderately progressive bourgeois ex-minister Guizot
who was deceived by the revolutionary trimmings of Louis Napoleon's
coup d'etat of 1851 and, when he heard the news burst out into the
alarmed cry, "This is the complete and final triumph of socialism."
Even the leading representative of French socialism, P. J. Proudhon,
was taken in by the violently anti-bourgeois attitude displayed by the
revolutionary imperialist, and he devoted a famous pamphlet to the
thesis that the coup d'etat of the Second of December did in fact
"demonstrate the social revolution."<a href="#01">[1]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, in many ways that counterrevolutionary aftermath of
1848 is comparable to the infinitely more serious and more extended
counterrevolutionary movement through which European society is passing
today after the experience of the Russian, the German, and the other
European revolutions which followed in the wake of the First World War.
Every party and every political tendency had to go through a certain
period of bewilderment until it had adapted itself to a totally changed
situation. Marx himself, although he utterly despised the imperialist
adventurer because of his personal inadequacy, was inclined to believe
in the revolutionary significance of the counterrevolutionary coup. He
described the historical outcome of the two years of revolutionary
defeat from 1848 to 1849 by the paradoxical statement that "this time
the advance of the revolutionary movement did not effect itself through
its immediate tragicomic achievements but, the other way round, through
the creation of a united and powerful counterrevolution, through the
creation of an antagonist by opposing whom the party of revolt will
reach its real revolutionary maturity." And even after the fateful
event he most emphatically restated his conviction that "the
destruction of the parliamentary republic contains the germs of the
triumph of the proletarian revolution." This is exactly what the German
Communists and their Russian masters said 80 years later when they
welcomed the advent of Nazism in Germany as a "victory of revolutionary
communism."</p>

<p>This ambiguous attitude of Proudhon and Marx toward
counterrevolution was repeated ten years later by Ferdinand Lassalle, a
close theoretical disciple of Marx and at that time the foremost leader
of the growing socialist movement in Germany. He was prepared to
cooperate with Bismarck at the time when that unscrupulous statesman
was toying with the idea of bribing the workers into acceptance of his
imperialistic plans by an apparent adoption of the universal franchise
and some other ideas borrowed from the 1848 revolution and the Second
Empire. Lasalle did not live to see Bismarck at the end of the 70's,
when he had subdued the liberals and the ultra-montane Catholic party,
revert to his old dream of enforcing a kind of "tory-socialism" based
on a ruthless persecution and suppression of all genuine socialist
workers' movements.</p>

<p>There is no need to discuss the wholesale conversion of
internationalists into nationalists and proletarian Social Democrats
into bourgeois democratic parliamentarians during and after the First
World War. Even such former Marxists as Paul Lensch accepted the war of
the Kaiser as a realistic fulfilment of the dreams of a socialist
revolution, and the about-face of the socialists they themselves
glorified as a "revolutionization of the revolutionaries." There was a
"national-bolshevist" fraction of the German Communist party long
before there was a Hitlerian National Socialist Party. Nor does the
military alliance that was concluded "seriously and for a long time"
between Stalin and Hitler in August 1939, contain any novelty for those
who have followed the historical development of the relations between
Soviet Russia and imperial, republican, and Hitlerian Germany
throughout the last twenty years. The Moscow treaty of 1939 had been
preceded by the treaties of Rapallo in 1920 and of Berlin in 1926.
Mussolini had already for several years openly proclaimed his new
fascist credo when Lenin was scolding the Italian Communists for their
failure to enlist that invaluable dynamic personality in the service of
their revolutionary cause. As early as 1917, during the peace
negotiations in Brest Litovsk, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht had
been aware of the dreadful danger that was threatening the proletarian
revolution from that side. They had said in so many words that "Russian
socialism based on reactionary Prussian bayonets would be the worst
that still could happen to the revolutionary workers' movement."</p>

<p>It appears from this historical record that there is indeed
something basically wrong with the traditional Marxian theory of the
social revolution and with its practical application. There is no
doubt, today less than at any former time in history, that the Marxian
analysis of the working of the capitalist mode of production and of its
historical development is fundamentally correct. Yet it seems that the
Marxian theory in its hitherto accepted form is unable to deal with the
new problems that arise in the course of a not merely occasional and
temporary but deep-rooted, comprehensive, and enduring
counterrevolutionary development.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The main deficiency of the Marxian concept of the
counterrevolution is that Marx did not, and from the viewpoint of his
historical experience could not, conceive of the counterrevolution as a
normal phase of social development. Like the bourgeois liberals he
thought of the counterrevolution as an "abnormal" temporary disturbance
of a normally progressive development. (In the same manner, pacifists
to the present day think of war as an abnormal interruption of the
normal state of peace, and physicians and psychiatrists until recently
thought of disease and more especially the diseases of the mind as an
abnormal state of the organism.) There is, however, between the Marxian
approach and that of the typical bourgeois liberal this important
difference: they start from a totally different idea about just what is
a normal condition. The bourgeois liberal regards existing conditions
or at least their basic features as the normal state of things, and any
radical change as its abnormal interruption. It does not matter to him
whether that disturbance of existing normal conditions results from a
genuinely progressive movement or from a reactionary attempt to borrow
revolution's thunder for the purpose of a counterrevolutionary
aggression. He is afraid of the counterrevolution just as much as of
the revolution and just because of its resemblance to a genuine
revolution. That is why Guizot called the coup d'etat "the complete and
final triumph of the socialist revolution" and why, for that matter,
Hermann Rauschning today describes the advent of Hitlerism as a "revolt
of nihilism."</p>

<p>As against the bourgeois concept, the Marxian theory has a
distinct superiority. It understands revolution as a completely normal
process. Some of the best Marxists, including Marx himself and Lenin,
even said on occasion that revolution is the only normal state of
society. So it is, indeed, under those objective historical conditions
which are soberly stated by Marx in his preface to the "Critique of
Political Economy."</p>

<p>Marx did not, however, apply the same objective and historical
principle to the process of counterrevolution, which was known to him
only in an undeveloped form. Thus, he did not see, and most people do
not see today, that such important counterrevolutionary developments as
those of present-day fascism and nazism have, in spite of their violent
revolutionary methods, much more in common with evolution than they
have with a genuine revolutionary process. It is true that in their
talk and propaganda both Hitler and Mussolini have directed their
attack mostly against revolutionary Marxism and communism. It is also
true that before and after their seizure of state power they made a
most violent attempt to weed out every Marxist and Communist tendency
in the working classes. Yet this was not the main content of the
fascist counterrevolution. In its actual results the fascist attempt to
renovate and transform the traditional state of society does not offer
an alternative to the radical solution aimed at by the revolutionary
Communists. The fascist counterrevolution rather tried to replace the
reformist socialist parties and trade unions, and in this it succeeded
to a great extent.</p>

<p>The underlying historical law, <span style="font-style: italic;">the law of the fully developed
fascist counterrevolution of our time</span>, can be formulated in the
following manner: After the complete exhaustion and defeat of the
revolutionary forces, the fascist counterrevolution attempts to fulfil,
by new revolutionary methods and in widely different form, those social
and political tasks which the so-called reformistic parties and trade
unions had promised to achieve but in which they could no longer
succeed under the given historical conditions.</p>

<p>A revolution does not occur at some arbitrary point of social
development but only at a definite stage. "At a certain stage of their
development the material productive forces of society come into
contradiction with the existing production-relations (or
property-relations) within which they hitherto moved. From being forms
of development, those relations turn into fetters upon the forces of
production. <span style="font-style: italic;">Then a period of social revolution sets in</span>." And again Marx
emphasized, and even to a certain extent exaggerated, the objectivistic
principle of his materialist theory of revolution according to which "a
formation of society never perishes until all the forces of production
for which it is wide enough have been developed." All this is true
enough as far as it goes. We have all seen how evolutionary socialism
reached the end of its rope. We have seen how the old capitalistic
system based on free competition and the whole of its vast political
and ideological superstructure was faced by chronic depression and
decay. There seemed no way open except a wholesale transition to
another, more highly developed form of society, to be effected by the
social revolution of the proletarian class.</p>

<p>The new historical development during the last twenty years
showed, however, that there was yet another course open. The transition
to a new type of capitalistic society, that could no longer be achieved
by the democratic and peaceful means of traditional socialism and trade
unionism, was performed by a counterrevolutionary and anti-proletarian
yet objectively progressive and ideologically anti-capitalistic and
plebeian movement that had learned to apply to its restricted
evolutionary aims the unrestricted methods developed during the
preceding revolution. (More particularly, both Hitler and Mussolini had
learned much in the school of Russian Bolshevism.) Thus, it appeared
that the evolution of capitalistic society had not reached its utter
historical limit when the ruling classes and the reformistic
socialists-those self-appointed "doctors at the sickbed of capitalism"
-reached the limits of their evolutionary possibilities. The phase of
peaceful democratic reforms was followed by another evolutionary phase
of development-that of the fascist transformation, revolutionary in its
political form but evolutionary in its objective social contents.</p>

<p>The decisive reason that the capitalistic formation of society
did not perish after the collapse of the First World War is that the
workers did not make their revolution. "Fascism," said its closest
enemy, "is a counterrevolution against a revolution that never took
place." Capitalistic society did not perish, but instead entered a new
revolutionary phase under the counterrevolutionary regime of fascism,
because it was not destroyed by a successful workers' revolution, and
because it had not, in fact, developed all the forces of production.
The objective and the subjective premises are equally important for the
counterrevolutionary conclusion.</p>

<p>From this viewpoint all those comfortable illusions about a
hidden revolutionary significance in the temporary victory of the
counterrevolution, in which the earlier Marxists so frequently
indulged, must be entirely abandoned. If counterrevolution is only
extremely and superficially connected with a social revolution by its
procedures, but in its actual content is much more closely related to
the further evolution of a given social system, and is in fact a
particular historical phase of that social evolution, then it can no
longer be regarded as a revolution in disguise. There is no reason to
hail it either as an immediate prelude to the genuine revolution, or as
an intrinsic phase of the revolutionary process itself. It appears as a
particular phase of the whole developmental process, not inevitable
like revolution yet becoming an inevitable step within the development
of a given society under certain historical conditions. It has reached
its up-to-now most comprehensive and important form in the present day
fascist renovation and transformation of Europe, which in its basic
economic aspect appears as a transition from the private and anarchic
form of competitive capitalism to a system of planned and organized
monopoly capitalism or state capitalism.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It would be the greatest folly and, for people even slightly
imbued with the great discoveries of Marx in the field of the social
sciences, a total relapse into a pre-materialist and pre-scientific
manner of thought if one were to expect that the historical progress
from competitive capitalism to planned economy and state capitalism
could be repealed by any power in the world. Least of all can fascism
be defeated by those people who, after a hundred years of shameless
acquiescence in the total abandonment of their original ideals, now
hasten to conjure up the infancy of the capitalist age with its belief
in liberty, equity, fraternity, and free trade, while at the same time
they surreptitiously and inefficiently try to imitate as far as
possible fascism's abolition of the last remnants of those early
capitalist ideas. They feel a sudden and unexpected urge to celebrate
the French Revolution's fourteenth of July and at the same time dream
of destroying fascism by adopting fascist methods.</p>

<p>In opposition to the artisan and petty-bourgeois spirit of
early utopian socialism, the first word of scientific and proletarian
socialism stated that big industry and the machine age had come to
stay, that modern industrial workers had to find a cure for the evils
of the industrial age on the basis of a further development of the new
industrial forces themselves. In the same manner the scientific and
proletarian socialists of our time must try to find remedies for the
wrongs of monopoly capitalism and fascist dictatorship on the basis of
monopoly and state capitalism itself. Neither free trade (that was not
so free for the workers after all) nor the other aspects of traditional
bourgeois democracy - free discussion and free press and free radio -
will ever be restored. They have never existed for the suppressed and
exploited class. As far as the workers are concerned, they have only
exchanged one form of serfdom for another.</p>

<p>There is no essential difference between the way the New York
Times and the Nazi press publish daily "all the news that's fit to
print"-under existing conditions of privilege and coercion and
hypocrisy. There is no difference in principle between the eighty-odd
voices of capitalist mammoth corporations-which, over the American
radio, recommend to legions of silent listeners the use of Ex-Lax,
Camels, and neighbourhood groceries, along with music, war, baseball
and domestic news, and dramatic sketches-and one suave voice of Mr.
Goebbels who recommends armaments, race-purity, and worship of the
Fuehrer. He too is quite willing to let them have music along with
it-plenty of music, sporting news, and all the unpolitical stuff they
can take.</p>

<p>This criticism of the inept and sentimental methods of
present-day anti-fascism does not imply by any means that the workers
should do openly what the bourgeoisie does under the disguise of a
so-called antifascist fight: acquiesce in the victory of fascism. The
point is to fight fascism not by fascist means but on its own ground.
This seems to the present writer to be the rational meaning of what was
somewhat mystically described by Alpha in the spring issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">Living
Marxism</span> as the specific task of "shock-troops" in the anti-fascist
fight. Alpha anticipated that even if the localized war-of-siege waged
during the first seven months of the present conflict were to extend
into a general fascist world war, this would not be a "total war" and
an unrestricted release of the existing powers of production for the
purpose of destruction. Rather, it would still remain a monopolistic
war in which the existing powers of production (destruction) would be
fettered in many ways for the benefit of the monopolistic interests of
privileged groups and classes. It would remain that kind of war from
fear of the emancipatory effect that a total mobilization of the
productive forces, even restricted to the purpose of destruction, would
be bound to have for the workers or, under the present-day conditions
of totally mechanized warfare, for the shocktroopers who perform the
real work of that totally mechanized war.</p>

<p>This argument of Alpha&rsquo;s can be applied more widely
and much more convincingly. First of all we can disregard for the
moment (although we shall have to return to it at a later stage) the
peculiar restriction of the argument to the "shock-troops" and to the
conditions of war. The whole traditional distinction between peace and
war, production and destruction, has lost in recent times much of that
semblance of truth that it had in an earlier period of modern
capitalistic society. The history of the last ten years has shown that
ever since, in a world drunk with apparent prosperity, the American
Kellogg Pact outlawed war, peace has been abolished. From the outset
Marxism was comparatively free from that simple-mindedness which
believed in an immediate and clear-cut difference between
production-for-use and production-for-profit. The only form of
production-for-use under existing capitalistic conditions is just the
production-for-profit. Productive labor for Marx, as for Smith and
Ricardo, is that labor which produces a profit for the capitalist and,
incidentally, a thing which may also be useful for human needs. There
is no possibility of establishing a further distinction between a
"good" and a "bad," a constructive and a destructive usefulness. The
Goebbelian defense of the "productivity" of the labor spent on
armaments in Germany by referring to the amount of "useful" labor spent
in the United States for cosmetics had no novelty for the Marxist.
Marx, who described the working class in its revolutionary fight as
"the greatest of all productive forces" would not have been afraid to
recognize war itself as an act of production, and the destructive
forces of modern mechanized warfare as part of the productive forces of
modern capitalistic society, such as it is. He, like Alpha, would have
recognized the "shock-troops" in their "destructive" activity in war as
well as in their productive activity in industry (armament and other
industries-war industries all!) as real workers, a revolutionary
vanguard of the modern working class. Historically it is a
well-established fact that the soldier (the hired mercenary) was the
first modern wage-laborer.</p>

<p>Thus, the old Marxian contradiction between the productive
forces and the given production relations reappears in the warlike as
well as in the peaceful activities of modern fascism. With it there
appear again the old contrast between the workers, who as a class are
interested in the full application and development of the productive
forces, and the privileged classes, the monopolists of the material
means of production. More than at any previous time the monopoly of
political power reveals itself as the power to rule and control the
social process of production. At the same time this means, under
present conditions, the power to restrict production-both the
production of industry in peace and destructive production in time of
war-and to regulate it in the interest of the monopolist class. Even
the "national" interest that was supposed to underly the present-day
fascist war waged by Hitler and Mussolini is revealed by the war itself
and will be revealed much more clearly by the coming peace as being
ultimately an interest of the international capitalist and monopolist
class. Much more clearly than at the end of the First World War it will
appear that this war is waged by both parties-by the attacking fascists
as well as by the defending "democrats"-as a united
counterrevolutionary struggle against the workers and the soldiers who
by their labor in peace and war prepared and fought the truly suicidal
war.</p>

<p>What, then, is the hope left for the anti-fascists who are
opposing the present European war and who will oppose the coming war of
the hemisphere? The answer is that, just as life itself does not stop
at the entrance of war, neither does the material work of modern
industrial production. Fascists today quite correctly conceive the
whole of their economy-that substitute for a genuine socialist
economy-in terms of a "war economy" (Wehrwirtschaft). Thus, it is the
task of the workers and the soldier to see to it that this job is no
longer done within the restrictive rules imposed upon human labor in
present-day capitalist, monopolist, and oppressive society. It has to
be done in the manner prescribed by the particular instruments used;
that is, in the manner prescribed by the productive forces available at
the present stage of industrial development. In this manner both the
productive and the destructive forces of present-day society-as every
worker, every soldier knows-can be used only if they are used against
their present monopolistic rulers. Total mobilization of the productive
forces presupposes total mobilization of that greatest productive force
which is the revolutionary working class itself.</p>
