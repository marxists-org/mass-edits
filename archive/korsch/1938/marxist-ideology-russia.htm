<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Communism, for us, is not a state of things to be established<br>
nor an ideal to which reality must adapt itself;<br>
we call communism the actual movement<br>
which transforms existing conditions.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marx</span></p>

<p>We have to deal here with an especially pointed example of the
striking discrepancy which in one form or another is noticeable in all
phases of the historical development of Marxism. It may be
characterized as the contradiction between the Marxian ideology on the
one hand, and the actual historical movement which, at a given time, is
concealed beneath that ideological disguise.</p>

<p>It is now almost a century since a special censor, dispatched
from Berlin to supplant the local authorities of Cologne in the
difficult task of garroting the "ultra-democratic" paper edited by the
24 year old Karl Marx, reported to the Prussian government that the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Rheinische Zeitung</span> might now safely be permitted to continue as the
"spiritus rector of the whole undertaking, Dr. Marx," had definitely
retired from his job and there was no possibility of a successor
capable of keeping up the "odious dignity" hitherto achieved by the
paper or of "prosecuting its policy with energy." That advice, however,
was not followed by the Prussian authorities who in this matter were
directed, as has now become known, by the Russian Tsar Nicholas I whose
vice-chancellor, Count de Nesselrode, had just then threatened the
Prussian ambassador in Moscow to lay before His Imperial Majesty's eyes
"the infamous attack which the <span style="font-style: italic;">Rheinische Zeitung</span>, published at
Cologne, had recently made on the Russian cabinet." That happened in
Prussia, 1843.</p>

<p>Three decades later, the censorship authorities of tsarist
Russia herself permitted the publication in Russia of Marx's work-the
first version of <span style="font-style: italic;">Capital</span> ever to appear in another than the German
language. The decision was based on this precious argument: "Although
the political convictions of the author are entirely socialist and
although the whole book is of a definitely socialist character, the
manner of its presentation is certainly not such as to make the book
open to all, and in addition it is written in a strictly mathematically
scientific style so that the committee declares the book to be immune
from prosecution."</p>

<p>The tsarist regime which was so eager to suppress even the
slightest offence committed in any European country against the Russian
supremacy, and so utterly careless as to the dangers implied in Marx's
scientific exposure of the capitalistic world as a whole, was in fact
never touched by the fierce attacks directed by Marx in all his later
career against the "immense and unresisted encroachments of that
barbarous power whose head is at St. Petersburg and whose hands are in
every cabinet of Europe." Yet it was to succumb to just that apparently
altogether remote menace which had invisibly lurked in the Trojan horse
inadvertently admitted into the precincts of the Holy Empire. It was
finally thrown over by the masses of the Russian workers whose vanguard
had learned its revolutionary lesson from that "mathematically
scientific" work of a lonely thinker, <span style="font-style: italic;">Das Kapital</span>.</p>

<p>Unlike Western Europe-where the Marxist theory arose in a
period when the bourgeois revolution was already approaching its close
and Marxism expressed a real and actualized tendency to pass beyond the
goals of the bourgeois revolutionary movement, the tendency of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">proletarian class</span> - Marxism in Russia was from the beginning nothing
more than an ideological form assumed by the material struggle for
putting across the capitalist development in a pre-capitalist country.
For this purpose Marxism was taken up greedily as the last word of
Europe by the entire progressive intelligentsia. Bourgeois society
fully developed in Western Europe was here just in its birth pangs. Yet
on this new soil the bourgeois principle could not make use, once
again, of those historical outworn illusions and self-deceptions with
which it had concealed from itself the restricted bourgeois content of
its developmental struggles in Its first heroic phase in the West, and
had kept its passions to the level of great historical events. For
penetration into the East, it needed a new ideological costume. And it
was just the Marxist doctrine taken over from the West which seemed to
be most able to render the growing bourgeois development in Russia that
important historical service. Marxism was far superior, in this
respect, to the native Russian creed of the revolutionary Narodniki
(populists). While the latter started from the belief that capitalism
as existing in the "unholy" countries of the West was impossible in
Russia, Marxism, by reason of its own historical origin, presupposed a
fully accomplished capitalistic civilization as a necessary historical
stage in the process of the ultimate realization of a truly socialistic
society.</p>

<p>Yet in order to render the rising bourgeois society in Russia
such ideological mid-wife service, the Marxist doctrine required a few
modifications even in its purely theoretical contents. This is the
basic reason for. the considerable theoretical concessions, otherwise
hard to explain, which Marx and Engels in the 70s and 80s made to the
set of ideas, essentially quite irreconcilable with their theory, that
up to then had been held by the Russian populists. The final and most
comprehensive form of those concessions is contained in the well-known
oracular statement of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Foreword to the Russian translation of the
Communist Manifesto</span> (1882):</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0px; width: 1243px;">The object of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Communist Manifesto</span> was to proclaim an
inevitably impending dissolution of present-day bourgeois property. In
Russia, however, we find by the side of the capitalist order which is
developing with feverish haste and by the side of bourgeois landed
property which is as yet in the process of formation, the larger half
of the land owned by the peasants in common.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0px; width: 1245px;">Thus arises the question. Can the Russian peasant community in
which the primitive common ownership of the soil subsists, although in
a stage of already far advanced disintegration, be immediately
transformed into a higher and communistic form of landed property, or
must it previously go through the same process of dissociation which is
represented in the historical development of the West?</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0px; width: 1245px;">The only possible answer to this question at the present time
is the following:-If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a
workers' revolution in the West so that the two supplement each other,
then the present-day Russian system of common ownership can serve as a
starting point of a communistic development.</p>

<p>In these sentences, and in numerous similar utterances
occurring in their correspondence, in the letters to the Russian
populist writer Nikolai-on, in the letter to Vera Sassulitch, and in
Marx's reply to a fatalistic interpretation of his theory of necessary
historical stages by the Russian critic, Michaelovski, there is already
anticipated in a way the whole of the later development of Russian
Marxism and thus also the ever widening gap between its ideology and
the actual historical content of the movement. It is true that Marx and
Engels qualified their acknowledgement of the intrinsic socialist
possibilities of existing pre-capitalistic conditions in Russia by the
cautious proviso that it was only together with a workers' revolution
in the West that the Russian Revolution might skip the capitalist stage
and pass from the prevailing semi-patriarchal and feudal conditions
directly to socialist conditions. (The same proviso was later repeated
by Lenin.) It is also true that this condition was not fulfilled
(neither then nor after October, 1917) and that, on the contrary, the
Russian peasant community to which Marx as late as 1882 attributed such
a powerful future role, was shortly afterwards completely wiped out of
existence. Yet it cannot be denied that even such apparently anti-
Marxian slogans as the recent Stalinist "theory" of building up
socialism in one country, misusing Marxism as an ideological cloak for
a development which in its actual tendency is capitalistic, can appeal
not only to the precedent set by the orthodox Marxist Lenin, but even
to Marx and Engels themselves. They, too, had been quite prepared,
under certain historical conditions, to remold their
critico-materialistic "Marxist" theory into a mere ideological
adornment of a revolutionary movement which claimed to be socialistic
in its ultimate tendency, but which in its actual process was
inevitably subject to all sorts of bourgeois limitations. There is only
this difference, and a remarkable difference indeed, that Marx, Engels
and Lenin did so in order to promote a future revolutionary movement
while Stalin definitely applied the "Marxist" ideology for the defence
of a non-socialistic status quo, and as a weapon against every tendency
of revolutionary realization.</p>

<p>And so began - actually during the life-time and with the
conscious and active collaboration of Marx and Engels-that particular
historical <span style="font-style: italic;">change of function</span> through which Marxism, adopted as a
ready-made doctrine by the Russian revolutionists, was in the further
development transformed from a theoretical tool of a proletarian
socialist revolution into a mere ideological disguise of a
bourgeois-capitalist development. As we have seen, that change of
function implied from the very outset a certain transformation of the
doctrine itself which in this case was achieved through a mutual
interpenetration and fusion of the traditional populist creed and the
newly adopted Marxist ideological elements. Though that transformation
of the Marxist theory was at first admitted by Marx and Engels (as they
imagined) as a transitory step only, to be retraced by the imminent
"workers' revolution in the West," it soon turned out to have been in
fact the first step toward the permanent transformation of their
revolutionary Marxist theory into a mere revolutionary myth which could
at the utmost work as an inspiration for the first stages of a
beginning revolution but in its final outcome was bound to act as a
brake upon the real revolutionary development rather than as its
furtherance.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">It is a spectacle worth noting, the way this historical
process of ideological adaptation of the Marxist doctrine has been
worked out during the following decades by the different schools of the
Russian revolutionaries themselves. It may be safely said that in those
violent debates on the perspective of the capitalist <span style="font-style: italic;">development</span> in
Russia which were waged in the closely restricted circles of the
Russian Marxists at home and in emigration from the 90's to the
outbreak of the war and to the overthrow of the tsarist government in
1917, and which have found their most important theoretical expression
in the principal economic work of Lenin, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Development of Capitalism
in Russia</span> (1899), the true content of the original Marxian theory as a
theoretical form of an independent proletarian and strictly socialist
movement was, in fact, no longer represented by either side, This is
certainly true with regard to the so-called legal Marxists who in their
"scientific" exposition of the objective aspect of the Marxist doctrine
boasted of a particularly unadulterated "purity," but abundantly made
up for that doctrinal righteousness by utterly abandoning all practical
consequences of the Marxist principles which might possibly pass beyond
the restricted bourgeois goals. Nor was the whole of the revolutionary
Marxian theory represented by other currents which during that period
sought to combine in one form or another a recognition of the
transitory necessity of capitalist development in Russia with an
anticipated ultimate struggle against the future conditions of society
which were to be created by that very development. Here belongs the
above-mentioned learned populist writer Nikolai-on, the Russian
translator of <span style="font-style: italic;">Das Kapital</span>, who in the early 90's, under the direct
influence of the Marxian doctrine, made the transition from the
orthodox populist belief in the absolute <span style="font-style: italic;">impossibility of capitalism in
Russia</span> to the Marxistically revised populist theory of the
impossibility of <span style="font-style: italic;">a normal and organic development of capitalism in
Russia</span>. Here belongs too, the lusty materialistic opponent of populist
"idealism," the orthodox Marxist Lenin, and his followers who, in the
later period, after their break with the Western-minded "Mensheviks"
claimed to be in their theory as well as in their practice the only
true inheritors of the entire revolutionary contents of Marx's theory
as revived and restituted in the doctrine of Bolshevist Marxism.</p>

<p>When from our present vantage point reached by historical
experience we look back at the heated theoretical disputes of that
earlier phase there seems to be a quite obvious relationship between
the populist theory of the "impossibility of a normal and organic
development of capitalism in Russia" (as represented by the Marxian
Narodnik Nikolai-on and combated at the time by the Marxists of all
shades, the "legal" as well as the "revolutionary," the Mensheviks and
Bolsheviks) on one side, and the two mutually opposed theories which in
a recent phase of the development of Russian Marxism faced each other
in the form of a ruling "<span style="font-style: italic;">Stalinism</span>" and an oppositional "<span style="font-style: italic;">Trotskyism</span>."
Paradoxically enough, both the prevailing "national-socialist" theory
of Stalin as to the possibility of building up socialism in one
country, and the apparently diametrically opposed "internationalist"
thesis, set up by Trotsky, of the inevitability of a "permanent"
revolution-that is, of a revolution passing beyond the bourgeois
revolutionary goals simultaneously on the Russian and on the European
(or the world-wide) scale-rest on the common ideological basis of a
neo-Narodnik belief in the absence or impossibility of a "normal and
organic" development of capitalism in Russia.</p>

<p>Both Trotsky and Stalin base their versions of the Marxist
ideology on the authority of Lenin. Indeed, even the most orthodox of
the orthodox Marxists who had fought a bitter struggle both against the
Narodnikism of Nikolai-on and against the Parvus-Trotskyist theory of
the "permanent revolution" before October, 1917, and who, in the same
way, had most consistently opposed after October the then prevailing
tendency to glorify the meager achievements of the later so-called
war-communism of 1918-20, concluded that life-long fight for
critico-revolutionary realism by upholding at a decisive moment the
neo-populist concept of a home-made Russian socialism against the
actually prevailing conditions. Within a few weeks those who had
opposed the socialistic idealization of the first years and who at the
first announcement of the NEP of 1921 had still quite soberly declared
this "new economic policy of a worker's and peasant's state" to be a
necessary step backward from the further-going attempts of
war-communism, discovered the socialistic nature of state capitalism
and a cooperatively tinged yet essentially bourgeois economy, Thus, it
was not the Leninist epigone Stalin but the orthodox Marxist Lenin who,
at that historical turning-point of the revolutionary development when
the hitherto undecided practical tendencies of the Russian Revolution
were "seriously and for a long time" directed to the restoration of a
non-socialistic economy, at the same time added what he then deemed to
be an indispensable ideological supplement to that final restriction of
its practical aims. It was the orthodox Marxist Lenin who in opposition
to all his earlier declarations first set up the new Marxist myth of
the inherently socialist character of the Soviet state and of the
thereby basically guaranteed possibility of a complete realization of
socialist society in an isolated Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>This degeneration of the Marxian doctrine to a mere
ideological justification of what in its actual tendency is a
capitalist state and thus, inevitably, a state based on the suppression
of the progressive revolutionary movement of the proletarian class,
closes the first phase of the history of the Marxist ideology in
Russia. This is at the same time the only phase during which the
development of Marxism in Russia seems to show an independent
character. Yet it should be pointed out that from a more comprehensive
viewpoint, in spite of appearances and of many real differences caused
by the specific conditions prevailing at different times in different
countries, the historical development of <span style="font-style: italic;">Russian Marxism</span> (inclusive of
its last Leninist and Stalinist stages) is essentially the same as that
of so-called <span style="font-style: italic;">Western (or Social Democratic) Marxism</span> of which it really
was and still is an integrating, though at present outwardly detached,
component. Just as Russia never was the unique and holy country as
dreamed by the Pan-slavists, and bolshevism never was that crude and
backward form of a pseudo-Marxist theory corresponding to the primitive
conditions of the tsarist regime as it was represented by the would-be
refined Marxists of England, France, and Germany, so the <span style="font-style: italic;">bourgeois
degeneration of Marxism in Russia today</span> is in no way essentially
different from the outcome of the series of ideological transformations
which, during the war and post-war periods and, even more visibly,
after the ultimate annihilation of all former Marxist strongholds by
the unopposed advent of fascism and nazism, befell the various currents
of so-called Western Marxism. Just as the "national socialism" of Herr
Hitler and the "corporative state" of Mussolini vie with the "Marxism"
of Stalin in an attempt to invade, by the use of a pseudo-socialist
ideology, the very brains and souls of their workers as well as their
physical and social existence, so does the "democratic" regime of a
people's front government presided by the "Marxist" Leon Blum or, for
that matter, by Mr. Chautemps himself, differ from the present-day
Soviet state not in substance, but only by a less efficient
exploitation of the Marxist ideology. Less than at any previous time
does Marxism today serve as a theoretical weapon in an independent
struggle of the proletariat, for the proletariat, and by the
proletariat. All so-called "Marxist" parties, both theoretically and in
their actual practice, appear deeply engaged in contributing, as minor
partners of the leading bourgeois protagonists, their modest share to
the solution of the problem which the American "Marxist," L. R. Boudin,
quite recently called "the greatest problem in Marxism-our relation to
the internal struggles of capitalist society."</p>
