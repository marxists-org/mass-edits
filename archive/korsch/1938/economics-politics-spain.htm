<hr class="end">
<p>In order to work out a realistic approach to the constructive work of the
revolutionary proletariat in Catalonia and other parts of Spain, we
must not confront its achievements either with some abstract ideal or
with results attained under entirely different historical conditions.
There is no doubt that the actual outcome of "collectivization," even
in those industries of Barcelona and the smaller towns and villages of
Catalonia where it can be studied at its best, lags far behind the
ideal constructions of the orthodox socialist and communist theories,
and even more so behind the lofty dreams of generations of
revolutionary syndicalist and anarchist workers in Spain since the days
of Bakunin.</p>

<p>As to historical analogies, the achievements of the Spanish
revolution during the period which began with the rapid counter-action
of the revolutionary workers against the invasion of Franco and his
fascist, National-Socialist, and bourgeois-democratic supporters, and
which now rapidly approaches its final phase, should not be compared
with anything which happened in Russia after October, 1917, nor with
the phase of the so-called war communism 1918-20, nor with the ensuing
phase of the NEP. During the whole process of revolutionary movement
beginning with the overthrow of the monarchy in 1931, there has not
been one single moment when the workers, or any party or organization
speaking in the name of the revolutionary vanguard of the workers, have
been in possession of the political power. This is true, not only on a
national, but also on a regional scale; it applies even to the
conditions prevailing in the syndicalist stronghold of Catalonia during
the first months after July, 1936, when the power of the government had
become temporarily invisible, and yet the new and still undefined
authority exercised by the syndicates did not assume a distinct
political character. Still the situation arising from these conditions
is not adequately described as that of a "dual power." It represented
rather a temporary eclipse of all state power resulting from the split
between its (economic) substance which had shifted to the workers and
its (political) shell, from the various internal conflicts between the
forces of Franco and the forces of the "Loyalists," Madrid and
Barcelona, and, finally, from the decisive fact that the main function
of the bureaucratic and military machinery of any capitalistic state,
the suppression of the workers, could not operate in any event against
workers in arms. </p>

<p>There is no use arguing (as many people have done) that during
the many phases of the revolutionary development of the last seven
years there has evolved more than once-in October, 1934, and, again, in
July, 1936, and in May, 1937-an "objective situation" in which the
united revolutionary workers of Spain might have seized the power of
the state but did not do so either on account of theoretical scruples
or by reason of an internal weakness of their revolutionary attitude.
This may be true in regard to the July-Days of 1936 when the
syndicalist and anarchist workers and militias of Barcelona had stormed
the arms depots of the government and further equipped themselves with
the weapons seized from the defeated fascist revolt, just as it may be
true in regard to the July-Days of 1917, when the revolutionary workers
and soldiers in Petrograd demonstrated under the Bolshevik slogans "<span style="font-style: italic;">all
power to the Soviets</span>" and "<span style="font-style: italic;">down with the capitalist ministers</span>," and
when during the night from the seventeenth to the eighteenth a
reluctant Central Committee of the Bolshevik party was finally
compelled to reverse its earlier refusal to participate in a
"premature" revolutionary attempt and unanimously to call upon the
soldiers and the people to take arms and join what they still described
as a "peaceful demonstration."</p>

<p>As against those people who today, twenty years after the
event, extol the revolutionary consistency of the Bolshevik leadership
of 1917, to the detriment of the "chaotic irresolution" displayed by
the dissensions and waverings of the Spanish syndicalists and
anarchists of 1936-38, it is quite appropriate here to recall the fact
that in those black days of July, 1917, three months before the victory
of the Red October in Soviet Russia, Lenin and his Bolshevik party also
were unable to prevent or to turn into victory a situation which was
described at the time in the following manner by the late S. B. Krassin
who had been a Bolshevik and was later to accept high office in the
Soviet government, but at this time was the manager of an industrialist
establishment: "The so-called masses, principally soldiers and a number
of hooligans, loafed aimlessly about the streets for two days, firing
at each other, often out of sheer fright, melting away at the slightest
alarm or fresh rumour, and without the slightest idea of what it was
all about."<a href="#01">[1]</a></p>

<p>Even a considerable time later when the process of
glorification of victorious Bolshevism had already set in, but a mild
"self-criticism" was still possible among the higher ranks of the
ruling party, the Bolshevist people's commissar, Lunacharsky, recalled
the situation of July, 1917, by the following words: "We are bound to
admit that the party knew no way out of the difficulty. It was
compelled to demand of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionists,
through a demonstration, something they were organically unable to
decide upon, and, meeting with the refusal the party had expected, it
did not know how to proceed further; it left the demonstrators around
the Taurida Palace without a plan and gave the opposition time to
organize its forces, while ours were breaking up, and consequently we
went down to a temporary defeat with eyes quite open."</p>

<p>Nor were the immediate consequences of what may be called
here, in answer to the oft-repeated indictment of the lack of
revolutionary leadership manifested by the Spanish syndicalists, <span style="font-style: italic;">a
"failure" of the revolutionary Bolshevik party to seize the political
power in an objectively revolutionary situation</span>, any better for the
Russian Bolsheviks of 1917 than they have been in 1934 and '36 and '37
for the Spanish syndicalists and anarchists. On the eighteenth of July,
1917, the mischievous accusation was raised against Lenin that all his
actions since his arrival in Russia, and particularly the armed
demonstrations of the preceding two days, were secretly directed by the
German General Staff. The Bolshevik headquarters were raided. Their
newspaper offices were closed. Kamenev and Trotsky and numerous other
Bolshevik leaders were arrested. Lenin and Sinovjev went into hiding,
and Lenin was still in hiding when, almost two months later, he warned
his comrades against jeopardizing their revolutionary independence by
an unreserved support of the people's front government of Kerensky
against the counter-revolutionary rebellion of the commander-in-chief
of the Russian Armies, General Kornilov.</p>

<p>Thus, it cannot be said in fairness that the Spanish workers
and their revolutionary syndicalist and anarchist leadership neglected
to seize the political power on a national or even on a regional
Catalonian scale under conditions when this would have been done by a
really revolutionary party such as the Russian Bolsheviks, It makes no
sense to accept the tactics of the Russian Bolsheviks in July, 1917, as
a "cautious and realistic revolutionary policy" and denounce the same
policy as a "lack of revolutionary foresight and decision" when it is
repeated, under exactly analogous conditions, by the syndicalists in
Spain. One might then as well subscribe to the paradoxical statement
made by Pascal two-hundred years ago that "what is true on this side of
the Pyrenees is a lie on the other."</p>

<p>This is not to say that the revolutionary actions of the
Catalonian workers have not been fettered by their traditional attitude
of non-concernedness in all matters political and not strictly economic
and social. Even their most radical steps in the field of economic
reconstruction, taken at a time when they appeared and held themselves
to be unrestricted masters of the situation, were suffering from a
certain lack of that single-mindedness and consistency of purpose by
which the economic and political measures of the Bolshevik dictatorship
in Russia both infuriated and terribly frightened their enemies at home
and in every bourgeois country all over the world. There is, in the
bourgeois reports on conditions in revolutionary Spain, very little of
the uneasiness with which foreign spectators looked at the assumed
"atrocities" of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia at the time of the
"sanitary cordon." (Even the formerly revolutionary Marxist, Karl
Kautsky, in those days repeated and, as I think, seriously believed in
the news that the Bolshevik dictatorship in Russia had crowned their
expropriatory measures by a "socialization of the wives of the
bourgeoisie.") There is, as compared with those exuberances, even a
touch of humor and a certain jovial reliance on what the reporter calls
the persisting "individualism" of the Spanish people, in the story of
the Spanish "collectivizations" given by a special correspondent of the
(London) <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span> at the hour of the arrival of the Negrin government at
Barcelona:</p>

<p>The arrival of the central government brought new life to
Barcelona. The huge city was beginning to droop under the burden of
collectivization. Happiness cannot be collectivized in Spain, where the
individual persists in remaining his own master. An hotel proprietor
who could not endure to be a waiter in his own establishment is a
waiter elsewhere. Of a well known Catalan actor it is told that,
wearying of playing the principal part on the scene and a humble one on
the payroll, he proposed exchange with a scene shifter, saying: "We
earn the same, let me pull the ropes while you go and pull the faces."
It has become quite a joke, though a poor one, among audiences at
cinemas to point out professors of the Conservatoire playing second
fiddle in the band.</p>

<p>Even the more elaborate and much more hostile report given one
month later by the Barcelona correspondent of the <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> was
supplemented by some quite attractive pictures which illustrated the
life and work in "Collectivized Shops in Spain," and which were made
even more attractive to the state-worshipping and bond-speculating
readers of the Times by the cheerful remark that "Because loyalists
prefer state control to workers' control and wish to protect foreign
interests in Spain, collectivization-as in the clothing plants pictured
here-is being limited." In the same vein "Spain's Strong Man" (the
now-debunked defence minister of the loyalist government, Indalecio
Prieto) was shown in a photograph and described to the petty bourgeois
readers of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Evening Standard</span> of March 7, 1938, as a "comfortably fat
newspaper owner, with a chin or two to spare" and with a "fondness for
eels as his only gastronomic luxury," a man by the way whose "worth" is
"even recognized by General Franco" and who is personally well
acquainted with "the financier of Franco's movement," the illustrious
Juan March.</p>

<p>The very fact that the CNT and FAI themselves were finally
compelled to reverse their traditional policy of non-interference in
politics under the pressure of increasingly bitter experiences,
demonstrated for all but some hopelessly sectarian and illusionary
groups of foreign anarchists (who even now refuse to besmirch their
anti- political purity by wholehearted support of the desperate strife
of their Spanish comrades!), <span style="font-style: italic;">the vital connection between the economic
and political action in every sense and, most of all, in the
immediately revolutionary phase of the proletarian class struggle.</span></p>

<p>This, then, is the first and foremost lesson of that
concluding phase of the whole revolutionary history of post-war Europe
which is the Spanish revolution. It becomes even more important and
particularly impressive if we consider the wide difference of the
character of the Spanish working' class movements from all other types
of proletarian class struggles in Europe and the USA as established by
well-nigh three quarters of a century.</p>

<p>The validity of this lesson is not weakened by the relatively
moderate contents of the political demands raised by the CNT at the
present juncture. There is no doubt that the proposal of a "new
constitutional period which would sympathize with popular aspirations
within the socialist republic, which would be democratical and federal"
does not demand anything which the people's front government could
not, in principle, decide upon without a revolutionary change of its
hitherto professed bourgeois policy. Nor could the proposed creation of
a "National Economic Council on a political and trade unionist base,
with an equal representation of both the Social Democratic UGT and the
syndicalist CNT," transform the hitherto bourgeois- reformist bias of
the government into a revolutionary-proletarian tendency. But here
again appears a close analogy between the tactics followed by the
syndicalists in present-day Spain and the attitude observed by the
Russian Bolshevik party up to and even after the collapse of the
Kornilov rebellion. If this analogy is true, if we can show that even a
revolutionary party so predominantly political and politically
experienced as the party which made the Russian October did not rise to
its ultimate perfection before the advent of an altogether different
historical situation, how then could we expect such super-human and
supra-historical excellence from a hitherto unpolitically-minded and
politically almost inexperienced group of proletarian revolutionaries
under the undeveloped conditions of present-day Spain, where the
counterrevolutionary rebellion of the Iberian Kornilov has not
collapsed but has spread victoriously over the whole country and is now
attacking the very heart of industrial Spain, the last stronghold of
the anti-fascist and anti-capitalist forces, the proletarian province
of Barcelona?</p>

<p>There is indeed from the standpoint of a sober historical
research ample proof that the revolutionary Bolshevik leadership of
1917 was in no way exempt from those human waverings and want of
foresight which are inherent in any revolutionary action. Even after
the victorious conclusion of that masterpiece of political strategy
which the Bolsheviks, led and inspired by Lenin, performed in the days
of the Kornilov-affair in August and September, 1917, when, in
accordance with Lenin's most subtle instruction, they endeavoured "to
fight against Kornilov, even <span style="font-style: italic;">as Kerensky's troops do</span>," but did not
support Kerensky but, <span style="font-style: italic;">on the contrary exposed his weakness</span>," Lenin
still acted on the assumption that the Provisional Government had
become so manifestly weak after the defeat of Kornilov, that it offered
an opportunity for a peaceful development of the revolution on the
basis of the replacement of Kerensky by a government of
socialist-revolutionists and Mensheviks responsible to the Soviets. In
such a government the Bolsheviks would not participate, but they would
"<span style="font-style: italic;">refrain from immediately advancing the demand for the passing of power
to the proletariat and the poorest peasants, and from "evolutionary
methods of struggle for the realization of this demand</span>." Of course, in
suggesting this line of action in his famous article "On Compromises"
in September, 1917, Lenin did not boast of such flawless revolutionary
righteousness as does for instance Stalin in present-day Russia or
those state-denying anarchists in present-day ultra-capitalist Holland.
Yet this small piece of real history shows how little the minor
followers of Lenin are entitled to criticize the deficiencies of the
syndicalist achievements in revolutionary Catalonia, let alone the
well-known ambiguity of the "help" given to the revolutionary workers
of Spain during the first and later stages of their strife by the
Communists and the Russian state both in Spain and in the
Non-Intervention Committee.<a href="#02">[2]</a></p>

<p>There is thus a deep shadow thrown on the constructive work
resulting from the heroic efforts and sacrifices of the revolutionary
workers in all parts of Spain where the syndicalist and anarchist
slogan of "collectivization" prevailed over the Social Democratic and
Communist slogans of "<span style="font-style: italic;">nationalization</span>" and "<span style="font-style: italic;">state interference</span>." All
this constructive work was done, as it were, preliminarily only. Its
further advance and its very existence depended upon the progress of
the revolutionary movement and, first of all, upon a decisive defeat of
the counter-revolutionary attack of Franco and his powerful fascist and
semi-fascist allies. Even at this late stage, when the defeat of the
highly advertised now loyalist army has already so strongly manifested
the intrinsic weakness of the Negrin government that the
above-mentioned chief representative of the fascist and capitalist
forces within the people's front government, Indalecio Prieto, had to
be kicked out ingloriously, and a &ldquo;reconstruction" of the
government in a &ldquo;leftist&rdquo; direction became
inevitable, a last hour victory of the revolutionary proletarian forces
rallied in Barcelona - either with or without a rehearsal of the
insurrection of the communardes in besieged Paris 1871-would immensely
enhance the immediate historical and practical importance of the great
experiment in a genuine proletarian collectivization of industry, which
was initiated and carried through by the workers and their unions
during the last two years.</p>

<p>Short of such a favorable turn, the story of the Catalonian
<span style="font-style: italic;">collectivization</span> which is told in the most impartial and impressive
manner in a small book, published by the CNT-FAI and hitherto not
translated into English,<a href="#03">[3]</a> and on which we propose to base our
analysis and criticism of the Spanish experiences in the next issue,
cannot claim any greater merit than what we know from Marx, Engels,
Lissagarays, and other writers about the economic experiments of the
revolutionary Commune of the Paris workers in 1871. They are a part of
the historical past just as are today the attempts of the revolutionary
Italian workers in 1920, which were later annihilated by the hordes of
Mussolini subsidized by the frightened Italian landowners and
capitalists, and as are the equally frustrated attempts made several
times between 1918 and 1923 by the vanguards of the German and
Hungarian workers. In the same way the more comprehensive and certainly
much more illustrious temporary achievements attained by the
revolutionary Russian workers in the period of a really communistic
experimentation of 1918-20 did not retain any practical importance for
the later development of the so-called socialist construction in Soviet
Russia. They were soon afterwards denounced by the Bolsheviks
themselves as a mere "negative form" of communism temporarily thrust
upon a reluctant Bolshevik leadership by the emergencies of war and
civil war. Thus the great historical experiment of the so-called War
Communism, which in fact represented a far more positive move toward a
Communist society than the measures of any NEP, NEO-NEP, or other
variances of the no more socialist and proletarian policies which were
later inaugurated by the various combinations of the post-Leninist and
Stalinist bureaucracy, became a forgotten and abandoned episode of past
history in the very country which even today claims to match in front
of the international proletariat by the so-called construction of
socialism in a single country.</p>

<p>Even before this new turn of the Bolshevik economic policy, on
December 4, 1919, two years after the full seizure of the state power,
Lenin in a speech delivered to the <span style="font-style: italic;">First Congress of Agricultural
Communes and Agricultural Artels</span> gave the following description of the
results until then achieved by the Bolshevik struggle for communism:
"Communism, when people work because they realize the necessity of
working for the common good. We know that we cannot establish a
socialist system now - God grant that it may be established in our
children's time, or perhaps in our grandchildren's time."<a href="#04">[4]</a></p>

<p>"<span style="font-style: italic;">To serve the history of the revolution</span>" is the program which
is invisibly written on the front page of the above cited faithful and
comprehensive report on the positive results achieved in the economic
field by the revolutionary workers of Barcelona and by the industrial
and agricultural laborers in many a small Catalonian town or remote and
forgotten village. "To serve history" means for the writer as well as
for us, revolutionary workers of a dismal world laboring in the crisis
and decay of all forms of the "old" socialist, communist, and anarchist
labor movements, to learn from the deeds and from the mistakes of past
history the lesson for the future, the ways and means for the
realization of the goals of the revolutionary working class.</p>
