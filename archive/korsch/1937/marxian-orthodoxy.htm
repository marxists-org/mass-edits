Having to do withboth the theory and the practice of the socialist movement, it eruptedpublicly for the first time in the German and international SocialDemocracy, now a generation ago, shortly after the death of FriedrichEngels. When at that time Edward Bernstein, who was already able tolook back upon important achievements in the field of Marxism,expressed for the first time from his exile in London his "heretical"opinions (drawn mainly from study of the English labor movement)regarding <span style="font-style: italic;">the real relation between theory and practice in the Germanand all-European socialist movement of the time</span>, his views and designswere for the moment and still for a long while thereafter, both amongfriends and foes, uniformly misinterpreted and misunderstood. </p><p>In the entire bourgeois press and specialized literature hiswork "Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben derSozialdemokratie" was greeted with hymns of joy and showered withpaeans of praise. The leader of the then just founded NationalSocialist Party - the social-imperialist ideologist Friedrich Naumann -declared in his sheet, without circumlocution: "Bernstein is ourfarthest advanced post in the camp of the Social Democracy." And inbroad circles of the liberal bourgeoisie there existed at the time theconfident hope that this first fundamental "revisionist'' of Marxism inthe Marxist camp would formally also separate himself from thesocialist movement and desert to the bourgeois reform movement.</p><p>These hopes of the bourgeoisie found their counterpart in astrong sentiment from the camp of the Social Democratic party and tradeunion movement of the time. However much the leaders of this movementwere privately clear on the point that Bernstein's "revision" of theMarxist program of the Social Democracy was nothing more than thepublic blurting out of the development <span style="font-style: italic;">which had long since beenaccomplished in practice</span> and through which the Social Democraticmovement <span style="font-style: italic;">had been transformed from a revolutionary class strugglemovement into a political and social reform movement</span>, still they tookgood care not to give utterance to this inner knowledge toward theoutside. Bernstein having ended his book with his advice to the partythat it "might venture to appear that it is: a democratically socialistreform party," he was confidentially tapped on the shoulder (in aprivate letter published later) by that sly old demagog of the partyexecutive committee, Ignaz Auer, with the friendly warning: "My dearEddy, that is something which one does, but does not say." In theirpublic utterances, all the practical and theoretical spokesmen of theGerman and of the international Social Democracy, the Bebels andKautskys, Victor Adlers and Plekhanovs, and by whatever name they arecalled, were opposed to the insolent blabber of the carefully guardedsecret. At the party congress in Hanover in 1899, in a four-day debateopened by Bebel with a six-hour report, Bernstein was subjected to aregular trial. He barely managed to avoid formal exclusion from theparty. For many years thereafter, Bernstein was the butt of attackbefore the members and the voters, in the press and party meetings, atthe great official party and trade union congresses; notwithstandingthe fact that Bernstein's revisionism had already been victorious inthe trade unions and finally was no longer to be resisted in the partyeither, the <span style="font-style: italic;">anti-capitalist revolutionary "class-struggle party"</span>continued to be played without hesitation, literally to the very lastmoment-that is, until just before the closing of the social peace pactof 1914, followed by the pact of partnership between capital and laborin 1918. </p><p>For this double-faced attitude toward the first seriousattempt at a <span style="font-style: italic;">theoretical formulation of the actual ends and means ofthe bourgeois labor policy which they actually practiced</span>, the practicaland theoretical representatives of the policy pursued by the SocialDemocratic party executive and the affiliated trade-union apparatus hadtheir good reasons. Just as today the representatives of the CommunistParty apparatus in Russia and in all national sections of the CommunistInternational, in order to veil the actual character of their policy,need the pious legend of the ever-advancing "<span style="font-style: italic;">construction of socialismin the Soviet Union</span>" and of the "revolutionary" character (guaranteedif only by that very fact) of the whole policy and tactic, at anyparticular time, of all Communist party leadership in all countries, soat that time the crafty demagogs in the Social Democratic partyexecutive and at the head of the trade-union apparatus needed, for theconcealment of their actual tendencies, the pious legend that themovement which they were conducting was obliged, to be sure, for thepresent time, to restrict itself to merely tinkering at the bourgeoisstate and the capitalist economic order by way of all sorts of reforms,but that "<span style="font-style: italic;">in the final goal</span>" it was on the way to the socialrevolution, to the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and the abolition ofthe capitalist economic and social order. </p><p>But it was not only the demagogs of the Social Democraticparty executive and their "theoretical" advocates who, through thepseudo-struggle which they waged at that time against Bernstein'srevisionism, lent aid to the danger of an advancing reformist andbourgeois degeneration of the socialist movement. Rather in the samedirection with them there worked for a considerable time, unconsciouslyand against their will, also such radical revolutionary theoreticiansas Rosa Luxemburg in Germany and Lenin in Russia, who according totheir subjective design conducted a serious and uncompromising struggleagainst the tendency expressed by Bernstein. When at the present time,on the basis of the new experiences of the last three decades, we lookback on those earlier directional struggles within the German and all-European labor movement, it is somewhat tragic to see how deeply evenLuxemburg and Lenin were stuck in the illusion that "Bernsteinism"represented only a deviation from the basically revolutionary characterof the then Social Democratic movement, and with what objectivelyinadequate formulas they too sought to conduct the struggle against thebourgeois degeneration of the socialist party and trade union policy. </p><p>Rosa Luxemburg closed her polemic against Bernstein, publishedin the year 1900 under the title "Sozialreform oder Revolution?" withthe catastrophically false prophecy that "<span style="font-style: italic;">Bernstein&rsquo;s theorywas the first, and at the same time the last attempt to give atheoretic base to opportunism.</span>" She was of the opinion thatopportunism, in Bernstein's book in theory, and in Schippel's positionon the question of militarism in practice, "<span style="font-style: italic;">had gone so far thatnothing more remained for it to do.</span>" And although Bernstein hademphatically stated that he "almost completely accepted the presentpractice of the Social Democracy" and at the same time haddevastatingly laid bare the entire practical insignificance of the thenusual revolutionary phase of the "final goal" with his openacknowledgement: "<span style="font-style: italic;">The final goal, of whatsoever nature, is nothing tome; the movement everything,</span>" still Rosa Luxemburg, in a remarkable<span style="font-style: italic;">ideological bedazzlement, did not direct her critical</span> counterattackagainst the Social Democratic practice but against Bernstein's theory,which was nothing more than a truthful expression of the actualcharacter of that practice. The feature by which the Social Democraticmovement was distinguished from the bourgeois reform policy, she sawnot in practice but expressed in the "<span style="font-style: italic;">final goal</span>" added on to thispractice merely as ideology and very often only as a phrase. Shedeclared passionately that "<span style="font-style: italic;">the final goal of socialism constitutes theonly decisive factor distinguishing the Social Democratic movement frombourgeois democracy and from bourgeois radicalism</span>, the only factortransforming the entire labor movement from a vain effort to repair thecapitalist order into a class struggle against this order, for thesuppression of this order." This general "final goal" which accordingto the words of Rosa Luxemburg should be everything, and by which theSocial Democratic movement of that time was distinguished from thebourgeois reform politics, revealed itself in subsequent actual historyas in fact that <span style="font-style: italic;">nothing</span> which Bernstein, the sober observer of reality,had already termed it. </p><p>For all those people whose eyes have not yet been opened byall the facts of the last fifteen years, a convincing confirmation ofthis historical state of affairs is furnished by the expressdeclarations on the matter which have come from the main participantsthemselves on the occasion of the various "Marxian" anniversarycelebrations of recent times. Among these belongs, for example, thatmemorable banquet which was arranged in 1924 by the exemplars of SocialDemocratic Marxism, who were assembled in London for the sixtiethanniversary celebration of the first "International Working Men'sAssociation" in honor of <span style="font-style: italic;">the seventieth birthday of Kautsky</span>. Here thehistorical "dispute" between Kautsky's "revolutionary orthodox Marxism"and Bernstein's "revisionist" reformism found its harmonious close inthose "words of friendship" (reported by "Vorwaerts") spoken by theseventy-five-year old Bernstein in honor of the seventy-year oldKautsky and in the symbolical embracing ceremony by which the wordswere followed: "When Bernstein had ended, and the two old men whosenames have long since become honorable to a younger, the thirdgeneration, embraced each other and remained for several secondsclasped together-who on that occasion could avoid being moved, whocould wish to avoid it?" And in the year 1930, the seventy-five-yearold Kautsky writes in exactly the same sense in the Social Democratic"Kampf" of Vienna, in honor of the eightieth birthday of Bernstein: "Inparty-political matters we have been since 1880 Siamese twins. Evensuch persons can quarrel occasionally. We have attended to that now andthen quite extensively. But even at such times it was impossible tospeak of the one without thinking also of the other."</p><p>Subsequent testimonials of Bernstein and Kautsky illuminatequite dearly the tragic misunderstanding with which in the pre-warperiod those German left-radicals who, under the slogan "<span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionaryfinal goal against reformist daily practice</span>,&rdquo; sought toconduct the struggle against the practical and m the last analysis alsotheoretical bourgeoisification of the Social Democratic labor movement,in reality merely supported and promoted this historical process ofdevelopment carried out by Bernstein and Kautsky in their respectiveroles. With due allowances, the same may be said, however, of stillanother slogan by means of which in the same period the Russian MarxistLenin, in his own country and on an international scale, sought to drawthe dividing line between the bourgeois and the "revolutionary" laborpolicy. Just as Rosa Luxemburg in her subjective consciousness was thesharpest adversary of Bernsteinism, and in the first edition of "Reformor Revolution?" in the year 1900 still expressly demanded Bernstein'sexclusion from the Social Democratic party, so also was Leninsubjectively a deadly enemy of the "renegade" Bernstein, and of all theheretical deviations committed by him, in his "herostraticallycelebrated" book, from the pure and undefiled doctrine of the"revolutionary" Marxist program. But exactly like Luxemburg and theGerman left-radical Social Democrats, so also the Bolshevist SocialDemocrat Lenin made use, for this struggle against Social Democraticrevisionism, of a wholly <span style="font-style: italic;">ideological platform</span>, in that he sought theguarantee for the "revolutionary" character of the labor movement, notin its actual economic and social class content, but expressly only inthe <span style="font-style: italic;">leadership of this struggle by way of the revolutionary PARTYguided by a correct Marxist theory.</span> </p><p style="font-weight: bold;">Notes</p><p>1.
