<h3>I </h3>

<p>What should every class-conscious worker know about the
revolutionary commune in the present historical epoch which has on its
agenda the revolutionary self-liberation of the working class from the
capitalist yoke? And what is known about it today by even the
politically enlightened and therefore self-conscious segment of the
proletariat?</p>

<p>There are a few <span style="font-style: italic;">historical facts</span>, together with a few
appropriate remarks by Marx, Engels, and Lenin, which now
after half a century of Social Democratic propaganda prior to the Great
War and after the powerful new experiences of the last fifteen years,
have already become part and parcel of proletarian consciousness.
However, this piece of world history is today mostly dealt with as
little in the schools of the "democratic" (Weimar) republic as it was
earlier in the schools of the Kaiser's imperial monarchy. I am
referring to the history and significance of the glorious Paris
Commune, which hoisted the red flag of proletarian revolution
on March 18, 1871, and kept it flying for seventy-two days in fierce
battles against an onslaught of a well-armed hostile world. This is the
revolutionary commune of the Paris workers in 1871 <span style="font-style: italic;">of which Karl Marx
said in his address to the General Council of the International Workers
Association on May 30, 1871, on the civil war in France</span>, that its "true
secret" lay in the fact that <span style="font-style: italic;">it was essentially a government of the
working classes</span>, "the result of the struggle by the producing class
against the propertied class, the finally discovered political form
under which the economic liberation of labor could develop." And it was
in this sense that twenty years later, when on the occasion of the
founding of the Second International and the creation of <span style="font-style: italic;">proletarian
May Day celebrations</span> as the first form of direct international mass
action, the propertied classes once again were overcome with holy
terror whenever the alarming words "dictatorship of the proletariat"
were sounded. Friedrich Engels flung the proud sentences into the faces
of the startled philistines: "Well then, gentlemen, would you like to
know what this dictatorship looks like? <span style="font-style: italic;">Look at the Paris Commune. That
was the dictatorship of the proletariat</span>." And then again, more than two
decades later, the greatest revolutionary politician of our time,
Lenin, analyzed in exact detail the experiences of the Paris Commune
and the struggle against the opportunist decline and confusion in
regard to the theories of Marx and Engels in the main part of his most
important political work <span style="font-style: italic;">State and Revolution</span>. And when a few weeks
later the Russian Revolution of 1917, which had begun in February as a
national and bourgeois revolution, broke through its national
and bourgeois barriers and expanded and deepened into the first
proletarian world revolution, the masses of West European workers (and
the progressive sections of the working class of the whole world),
together with Lenin and Trotsky, welcomed this new form of government
of the revolutionary "council system" as the direct continuation of the
"revolutionary commune" created half a century earlier by the Paris
workers.</p>

<p>So far, so good. As unclear as the ideas may have been that
bound together the revolutionary workers under the formula "all power
to the councils," following that revolutionary period of storm and
stress which spread far and wide over Europe after the economic and
political upheavals of the four war years; however deep
already then the rift may have been between these ideas and that
reality which in the new Russia had come to the fore under the name of
"Socialist Councils Republic" nonetheless, in that period <span style="font-style: italic;">the
call for councils war a positive form of development of a revolutionary
proletarian class will surging toward realization</span>. Only morose
philistines could bewail the vagueness of the councils concept at that
time, like every incompletely realized idea, and only lifeless pedants
could attempt to alleviate this defect by artificially contrived
"systems" like the infamous "little boxes-system" of <span style="font-style: italic;">Daumig and Richard
Muller</span>. Wherever in those days the proletariat established its
revolutionary class-dictatorship, as happened in Hungary and Bavaria
temporarily in 1919, it named and formed its "<span style="font-style: italic;">government of the
working class</span>"-which was a result <span style="font-style: italic;">of the struggle by the
producing class against the propertied class and whose determined
purpose was to accomplish the "economic liberation of labor" -
as a revolutionary council government</span>. And if in those days the
proletariat had been victorious in anyone of the bigger industrial
countries, perhaps in Germany during the big commercial strikes of
spring, 1919, or in the counteraction of the Kapp putsch in 1920, or in
the course of the so-called Cunow strike during the Ruhr-occupation and
the inflation year of 1923, or in Italy at the time of the occupation
of factories in October, 1920-then it would have established its power
in the form of a Council Republic and it would have united together
with the already existing "Federation of Russian Socialist Soviet
Republics" within <span style="font-style: italic;">a world-federation of revolutionary council
republics</span>.</p>

<p>Under today's conditions, however, the <span style="font-style: italic;">council concept</span> has
quite another significance, as does the existence of a so-called
socialist and <span style="font-style: italic;">"revolutionary" council government</span>. Now after the
overcoming of the world economic crisis of 1921 and the related defeat
of the German, Polish, and Italian workers-and the following chain of
further proletarian defeats including the British general strike and
miners' strike of 1926 - <span style="font-style: italic;">European capitalism has commenced a new cycle
of its dictatorship on the backs of the defeated working class</span>. Under
these changed objective conditions we, the revolutionary
proletarian class-fighters of the whole world, cannot any more hold
subjectively onto our old belief, quite unchanged and unexamined, in
the revolutionary significance of the council concept and the
revolutionary character of <span style="font-style: italic;">council government</span> as a direct development
of that <span style="font-style: italic;">political form of the proletarian dictatorship</span> "discovered"
half a century ago by the Paris communardes.</p>

<p>It would be superficial and false, when looking at the
flagrant <span style="font-style: italic;">contradictions</span> existing today between the name and the real
condition of the Russian "Union of Socialist Soviet Republics," to
satisfy ourselves with the statement that the men in power in
present-day Russia "betrayed" that <span style="font-style: italic;">original "revolutionary" council
principle</span>, just as in Germany <span style="font-style: italic;">Scheidemann, Muller, and Leipart</span> have
"betrayed" their "revolutionary" <span style="font-style: italic;">socialist principles of the dap before
the wa</span>r. Both claims are true without doubt. The Scheidemanns,
Mullers, and Leiparts were traitors to their socialist principles. And
in Russia the "dictatorship" exercised today from the highest pinnacle
of an extremely exclusive government-party apparatus by means of a
million-headed bureaucracy over the proletariat and the whole of Soviet
Russia-that only in name is still reminiscent of the "Communist" and
"Bolshevik" party-has as little in common with the revolutionary
council concept of 1917 and 1918 as the Fascist party dictatorship of
the former revolutionary Social Democrat Mussolini in Italy. However,
so little is explained in both cases in regard to "betrayal" <span style="font-style: italic;">that
rather the fact of betrayal itself requires explanation</span>.</p>

<p>The real task that the contradictory development from the once
revolutionary slogan "All Power to the Councils" to the now
capitalist-fascist regime in the so-called socialist soviet-state has
put on the agenda for us class-conscious revolutionary proletarians is
rather a task of <span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary self-critique</span>. We must recognize that
not only does that <span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary dialectic</span> apply to the ideas and
institutions of the feudal and bourgeois past, but likewise to all
thoughts and organizational forms which the working class itself has
already brought forward during the hitherto prevailing stages of its
historical struggle for liberation. It is this dialectic which causes
the <span style="font-style: italic;">good deed</span> of yesterday to become the misery of today&nbsp;as
Goethe said in his <span style="font-style: italic;">Faust</span> - as it is more clearly and definitely
expressed by Karl Marx: every historical form turns at a
certain point of its development from a <span style="font-style: italic;">developing form</span> of
revolutionary forces of production, revolutionary action, and
developing consciousness into the <span style="font-style: italic;">shackles</span> of that developing form. And
as this dialectical <span style="font-style: italic;">antithesis</span> of revolutionary development applies to
all other historical ideas and formations, it equally applies
also to those <span style="font-style: italic;">philosophical</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">organizational results of a certain
historical phase of revolutionary class struggle</span>, which is exemplified
by the Paris communards of almost 60 years ago in the "finally
discovered" political form of government of the working class in the
shape of a <span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary commune</span>. The same is applicable to the
following new historical phase of struggle in the revolutionary
movement of the Russian workers and peasants, and the international
working class, which brought forth the new form of the "<span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary
councils power</span>."</p>

<p>Instead of bewailing the "betrayal" of the council concept and
the "degeneration" of the council power we must gather by
illusion-free, sober, and historically objective observation the
beginning, middle, and end of this whole development within a <span style="font-style: italic;">total
historical panorama</span> and we must pose this <span style="font-style: italic;">critical question</span>: What is -
after this total historical experience -<span style="font-style: italic;">the real historical
and class-oriented significance of this new political form of
government,</span> which brought about in the first place the
<span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary Commune</span> of 1871, although its development was
forcefully interrupted after 72 days duration, and then the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Russian Revolution of 1917</span> in concrete, more final, shape?</p>

<p>It is all the more necessary to once again basically orient
ourselves concerning the historical and class-oriented
character of the revolutionary commune and its further development, the
revolutionary councils system, for even the barest of historical
critique shows how completely unfounded the widely spread conception is
today among revolutionaries who theoretically reject and want
to "destroy" in practice the parliament, conceived as a bourgeois
institution with regard to its origin and purpose, and yet at the same.
time see the so-called council system, and also its predecessor the
revolutionary commune;" as the essential form of proletarian government
which stands with its whole essence in irreconcilable opposition to the
essence of the bourgeois state, in reality it is the "commune," in its
almost thousand years of historical development, which represents an
<span style="font-style: italic;">older</span>, bourgeois form of government than parliament. The commune forms
from the beginnings in the eleventh century up to that highest
culmination which the revolutionary movement of the bourgeoisie found
in the French Revolution of 1789/93 the almost <span style="font-style: italic;">pure class-oriented
manifestation of that struggle which in this whole historical epoch the
then revolutionary bourgeois class has waged in various forms for the
revolutionary change of the whole hitherto existing feudal
order of society and the founding of the new bourgeois social order</span>.</p>

<p>When Marx - as we saw in the previously quoted sentence of his
"Civil War in France" - celebrated the <span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary Commune of the
Paris workers of 1871 as the "finally discovered political form under
which the economic liberation of labor could be consummated</span>," he was
aware at the same time that the "commune" could only take on this new
character - its traditional form having been passed on over hundreds of
years of bourgeois struggle for freedom - <span style="font-style: italic;">if it radically changed its
entire previous nature</span>. He expressly concerns himself with the
misinterpretations of those who at that time wanted to regard this "<span style="font-style: italic;">new
commune which shatters the modern state power</span>" as a "revival of the
medieval communes which preceded that state power and thence formed
their foundation." And he was far removed from expecting any wondrous
effects for the proletarian class struggle from the political <span style="font-style: italic;">form</span> of
the communal constitution per se- detached from the definite
proletarian class-oriented content, with which the Paris workers,
according to his concept, had for one historical moment filled this
political form, achieved through struggle and put into the service of
their economic self-liberation. To him the decisive reason enabling the
Paris workers to make the traditional form of the "commune" the
instrument of a purpose which was so completely opposed to their
original historically determined goal lies, rather, on the contrary, in
its being <span style="font-style: italic;">relatively undeveloped and indeterminate</span>. In the fully formed
bourgeois state, as it developed in its classical shape
especially in France (i.e., in the <span style="font-style: italic;">centralized modern
representative-state</span>), the supreme power of the state is, according to
the well known words of the "Communist Manifesto," <span style="font-style: italic;">nothing more than
&ldquo;an executive committee which administers the common affairs
of the bourgeois class as a whole</span>"; thus its bourgeois class character
is readily apparent. However, in those underdeveloped early historical
forms of bourgeois state constitutions, that also include the medieval
"free commune," this bourgeois class character, which essentially
adheres to every state, comes to light in a quite different form. As
opposed to the later ever more clearly appearing and ever more purely
developed character of the bourgeois state power as a "supreme public
power for the suppression of the working class, a machine of class
rule" (Marx), we see that in this earlier phase of development
the originally determined goal of the bourgeois class organization
still prevails as an organ of the revolutionary struggle of liberation
of the suppressed bourgeois class against the medieval feudal rule.
However little this struggle of the medieval bourgeoisie has in common
with the proletarian struggle for emancipation of the present
historical epoch it yet remains as a <span style="font-style: italic;">historical class struggle</span>. And
those instruments created then by the bourgeoisie for the requirements
of their revolutionary struggle contain to a certain
extent-but only to a certain extent--certain formal connecting links
with the formation of today's revolutionary struggle of emancipation
which is being continued by the <span style="font-style: italic;">proletarian class</span> on another basis,
under other conditions, and for other purposes.</p>

<p>Karl Marx had already at an earlier date pointed out the
special significance which these earlier experiences and
achievements of the bourgeois class struggle-which found their most
important expression in the various phases of development of
the <span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary bourgeois commune of the middle ages</span> - had in regard
to the forming of modern proletarian class consciousness and class
struggle; in fact, he pointed this out very much earlier than the great
historical event of the Paris Commune insurrection of 1871
permitted him to praise this new revolutionary commune of the Parisian
workers as the finally discovered political form of economic
liberation of labor. He had demonstrated the <span style="font-style: italic;">historical analogy</span>
existing between <span style="font-style: italic;">the political development of the bourgeoisie</span> as the
suppressed class struggling for liberation within the medieval feudal
state and <span style="font-style: italic;">the development of the proletariat in modern capitalist
society</span>. It is from this perspective that he was able to win his main
theoretical support for his special dialectical revolutionary
<span style="font-style: italic;">theory of the significance of trade unions and the trade union struggle</span>
- a theory which until this day is still not completely and correctly
understood by many Marxists from both the left and right wing. And he
arrived at it by comparing the modern coalitions of workers
with the communes of the medieval bourgeoisie, stressing the historical
fact that <span style="font-style: italic;">the bourgeois class likewise began their struggle against the
feudal social order by forming coalitions</span>. Already in the polemical
treatise against Proudhon we find in regard to this point the following
illustration, classical to this day:</p>

<p>In the bourgeoisie we have two phases to distinguish: that in
which it constituted itself as a class under the regime of feudalism
and absolute monarchy, and that in which, already constituted as a
class, it overthrew feudalism and monarchy to make society into a
bourgeois society. The first of these phases was the longer and
necessitated the greater efforts. This too began by partial
combinations against the feudal lords.</p>

<p>Much research has been carried out to trace the different
historical phases that the bourgeoisie has passed through, from the
commune up to its constitution as a class.</p>

<p>But when it is a question of making a precise study of
strikes, combinations and other forms in which the proletarians carry
out before our eyes their organization as a class, some are seized with
real fear and others display a <span style="font-style: italic;">transcendental</span> disdain. (Marx, <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Poverty of Philosophy</span>, chapter 2, # 5)</p>

<p>What is theoretically articulated here, by the young Marx in
the 1840's, who only recently crossed over to proletarian socialism,
and what he repeats in a similar form a few years later in the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Communist Manifesto</span> by illustrating the diverse phases of development
of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, he also articulates once again
20 years later in the well known resolution of the Geneva Congress of
the International Association of Workers with regard to trade unions,
He argues that the trade unions have already during their hitherto
prevailing development become "<span style="font-style: italic;">the focal points of organization of the
working class ... Just as the medieval municipalities and villages had
become focal points of the bourgeoisie</span>." This is so although the trade
unions are not aware of their focal significance beyond the
immediate daily tasks of defending the wages and working hours
of the workers against the continuous excessive demands of capital.
Hence in the future the trade unions <span style="font-style: italic;">must act consciously as such focal
points of the organization of the whole working class</span>.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>If one wants to understand Marx's later position regarding <span style="font-style: italic;">the</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary commune of the Parisian workers</span> in its real
significance, one must take his original concept on the historical
relationship between the organizational forms of the modern
proletarian and the earlier bourgeois class struggle as a starting
point. The commune arose from the struggle of the producing class
against the exploiting class and broke up in a revolutionary
act the prevailing bourgeois state machinery. When Marx celebrates this
new commune as the finally discovered form for the liberation of labor,
it was not at all his desire - as some of his followers later claimed
and still do so to this day - to designate or brand <span style="font-style: italic;">a definite form of
political organization</span>, whether it is called a <span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary
commune</span> or a <span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary council system</span>, as a singularly
appropriate and potential form of the revolutionary proletarian class
dictatorship. In the immediately preceding sentence, he
expressly points to "the multifariousness of interpretations
which supported the commune and the multiplicity of interests expressed
in the commune," and he explained the already established character of
this new form of government as a "<span style="font-style: italic;">political form thoroughly capable of
development</span>." It is just this <span style="font-style: italic;">unlimited capability of
development</span> of new forms of political power, created by the
Paris communardes in the fire of battle, which distinguished it from
the "classic development of bourgeois government," the centralized
state power of the modern parliamentary republic. Marx's essential
presupposition is that in the energetic pursuit of the real interests
of the working class this form can in the end even be used as that
lever which will overthrow the economic bases forming the existence of
classes, class rule, and the state. The <span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary communal
constitution</span> thus becomes under certain historical conditions the
political form of a <span style="font-style: italic;">process of development</span>, or to put it more clearly,
of a <span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary action</span> where the basic essential goal is no longer
to <span style="font-style: italic;">preserve any one form of state rule, </span>or<span style="font-style: italic;"> even to create a newer
"higher state-type</span>," but rather to create at last the material
conditions for the "withering away of every state altogether." <span style="font-style: italic;">Without
this last condition, the communal constitution was all
impossibility and all illusion</span>," Marx says in this context with all
desired distinctness.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, there remains still an unbalanced <span style="font-style: italic;">contradiction</span>
between on one hand Marx's characterization of the Paris Commune as the
finally discovered "<span style="font-style: italic;">political form</span>" for accomplishing the economic and
social self-liberation of the working class and, on the other hand, his
emphasis at the same time that the suitability of the commune for this
purpose rests mainly on its <span style="font-style: italic;">formlessness</span>; that is, on its
indeterminateness and openness to multiple interpretations. It appears
there is only one point at which Marx's position is perfectly clear and
to which he professed at this time under the influence of certain
political theories he had in the meantime come up against and
which were incorporated in this original political concept-and
not least under the practical impression of the enormous experience of
the Paris Commune itself. While in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Communist Manifesto</span> of
1847-48 and likewise in the Inaugural Address to the
International Workers' Association in 1864, he still had only
spoken of the necessity &ldquo;<span style="font-style: italic;">for the proletariat to conquer
political power</span>&rdquo; now the experiences of the Paris
Commune provided him with the proof that "the working class
can not simply appropriate the ready-made state machinery and put it
into motion for its own purposes, <span style="font-style: italic;">but it must smash the existing
bourgeois state machinery in a revolutionary way."</span> This sentence has
since been regarded as an essential main proposition and core of the
whole political theory of Marxism, especially since in 1917 <span style="font-style: italic;">Lenin at
once theoretically restored the unadulterated Marxian theory of the
state in his work "State and Revolution" and practically realized it
through carrying through the October Revolution as its executor</span>.</p>

<p>But obviously nothing positive is at all yet said about the
<span style="font-style: italic;">formal character</span> of the new revolutionary supreme state power
of the proletariat with the merely <span style="font-style: italic;">negative determination</span> that the
state power cannot simply "appropriate the state machinery" of the
previous bourgeois state "for the working class and set it in motion
for their own purposes." So we must ask: for which reasons does the
"Commune" in its particular, determinate form represent the finally
discovered political form of government for the working class, as Marx
puts it in his <span style="font-style: italic;">Civil War</span>, and as Engels characterizes it once
more at great length in his introduction to the third edition of the
Civil War twenty years later? Whatever gave Marx and Engels, those
fiery admirers of the <span style="font-style: italic;">centralized system of revolutionary bourgeois
dictatorship realized by the great French Revolution</span>, the idea to
regard precisely the "Commune" as the "political form" of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat</span>, when it
appeared to be the complete opposite to that system?</p>

<p>In fact, if we analyze more exactly the political program and
goals to be attained as proposed by the two founders of scientific
socialism, <span style="font-style: italic;">Marx and Engels</span>, not only in the time <span style="font-style: italic;">before the Paris
Commune insurrection</span>, but also <span style="font-style: italic;">afterwards</span>, the assertion cannot be
maintained that the form of proletarian dictatorship realized by the
Paris Commune of 1871 would in any particular sense be in unison with
those political theories. Indeed, Marx's great opponent in the First
International, <span style="font-style: italic;">Michael Bakunin</span>, had on this point the historical truth
on his side when he sarcastically commented on Marx's having
annexed the Paris Commune retrospectively:</p>

<p>"The impact of the Communist insurrection was so powerful that
even the Marxists, who had all their ideas thrown to the wind by it,
were forced to doff their hats to it. They did more than that: <span style="font-style: italic;">in
contradiction to all logic and their innermost feelings, they adopted
the program of the Commune and its aim as their own</span>. It was a comic,
but enforced travesty. They had to do it, otherwise they would have
been rejected and abandoned by all- so mighty was the passion which
this revolution had brought about in the whole world." (Cf. [Fritz]
Brupbacher: <span style="font-style: italic;">Marx and Bakunin</span>, pp. 114-115.)</p>

<p>The revolutionary ideas of the Paris communardes of 1871 are
partly derived from the federalistic program of Bakunin and Proudhon,
partly from the circle of ideas of the revolutionary Jacobins surviving
in Blanquism, and only to a very small degree in <span style="font-style: italic;">Marxism</span>.
Twenty years later, Friedrich Engels claimed that the Blanquists who
formed the majority of the Paris Commune had been forced by the sheer
weight of the facts to proclaim instead of their own program of a
"strict dictatorial centralization of all power in the hands
of the new revolutionary government" the exact opposite, namely the
<span style="font-style: italic;">free federation of all French communes with the Paris Commune</span>. On this
issue the same contradiction arises between Marx and Engels' political
theory upheld so far and their now prevailing unconditional
acknowledgment of the commune as the "finally discovered political
form" of the government of the working class. It is erroneous when
Lenin in his 1917 work "State and Revolution" describes the evolution
of the Marxian theory of state, as if Marx had in the transition period
up to 1852 already concertized the abstract formulation of the
political task of the revolutionary proletariat (as proposed in his
"Communist Manifesto" of 1847-48) to the effect that the victorious
proletariat must "<span style="font-style: italic;">destroy</span>" and&nbsp;"<span style="font-style: italic;">smash</span>", the
existing bourgeois supreme state power. Against this thesis of Lenin
speaks Marx and Engels' own testimony, who both declared repeatedly
that just the <span style="font-style: italic;">experience of the Paris Commune of 1871</span> provided for the
first time the effective <span style="font-style: italic;">proof</span> that "<span style="font-style: italic;">the working class cannot simply
appropriate the ready made state machinery and set it in motion for its
own purposes</span>." It was Lenin himself who provided the logical gap
appearing in his presentation of the development of
revolutionary Marxist state theory at this point by <span style="font-style: italic;">simply
jumping over a time span of 20 years</span> in his otherwise so historically
correct and philologically exact reproduction of Marx and Engels'
remarks on the state, He proceeds from the <span style="font-style: italic;">18th Brumaire of Louis
Bonaparte</span> (1852) straight on to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Civil War in France</span> (1871) and in
so doing overlooks among other things the fact that Marx summarized the
whole "political program" of the working class in this one lapidary
sentence of his Inaugural Address of the First International: "<span style="font-style: italic;">It is
therefore the great task of the working class now to seize political power</span>."</p>

<p>Yet even in the time after 1871, when Marx, on account of the
experience of the Paris Commune, advocated in a far more
certain and unequivocal way that ever before the indispensable
necessity of crushing the bourgeois state machinery and building the
proletarian class dictatorship, he was far removed from propagating <span style="font-style: italic;">a
form of government modelled on the revolutionary Paris Commune as the
political form</span> of proletarian dictatorship, Just for that one
historical moment-in which he unconditionally and without reservations
came forward on behalf of the heroic fighters and victims of the
commune vis-&agrave;-vis the triumphant reaction did he,
or so it appears, uphold this standpoint-and I am referring to the
Address to the General Council of the International Workers'
Association on the "Civil War in France," written in blood and fire on
behalf of this first international organization of the revolutionary
proletariat. For the sake of the revolutionary <span style="font-style: italic;">essence</span> of the Paris
Commune, he repressed the critique which from his standpoint
he should have exercised on the special <span style="font-style: italic;">form</span> of its historical
manifestation. If beyond that he even went a step further and
celebrated the political form of the revolutionary
communal-constitution directly as the "finally discovered form" of the
proletarian dictatorship, then the explanation does not lie any more
merely with his natural <span style="font-style: italic;">solidarity</span> with the revolutionary workers of
Paris, but also in a special, <span style="font-style: italic;">subsidiary purpose</span>. Having written the
Address to the General Council of the I.W.A, directly after the
glorious battle and defeat of the Paris communardes, Marx not only
wanted to <span style="font-style: italic;">annex the Marxism of the Commune but also at the same time
the Commune to Marxism</span>. It is in this sense that one must understand
this remarkable document, if one wishes to correctly grasp its meaning
and range of significance not only as a classic historical
document looked at as a hero's epic or as a death lament. Rather beyond
all that, it should be seen as <span style="font-style: italic;">a fractional polemical treatise of Marx
against his most intimate opponents in the bitter struggles which had
already broken out and would soon thereafter lead to the collapse of
the First International</span>. This fractional subsidiary purpose hindered
Marx from appraising in a historically correct and complete
way that interconnecting revolutionary movement of the French
proletariat which began with the<span style="font-style: italic;"> insurrections of the Commune in Lyon
and Marseilles in 1870</span> and had its climax in the Paris Commune
insurrection of 1871. It also forced him to explain the <span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary
communal constitution</span>, welcomed as the "finally discovered political
form" of proletarian class dictatorship, as a <span style="font-style: italic;">centralist</span>
government as well - although this was in contrast to its
actual essential being.</p>

<p>Already Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels themselves, and more so
Lenin, deny the charge that the Paris Commune had an essentially
federalist character. If Marx cannot help but explain in his
short account of the sketch of the All-French Communal Constitution
produced by the Paris Commune the unambiguous federalist aspects of
this constitution, then in so doing he still emphasizes purposively the
fact (naturally not denied by such federalists as Proudhon and Bakunin)
that "<span style="font-style: italic;">the unity of the nation was not to be broken but on the contrary
was to be organized</span>" through this communal constitution. He underlines
"<span style="font-style: italic;">the few but important functions</span>" which are <span style="font-style: italic;">still remaining to
be dealt with by a "central government" </span>within this communal
constitution. He remarks that according to the plan of the
Commune these functions "<span style="font-style: italic;">were not - as some intentionally falsified-to
be abolished, but were to be transferred to communal (and strictly
responsible) civil servants</span>." On this basis, Lenin later declared that
"<span style="font-style: italic;">not a trace of federalism is to be found</span>" in Marx's writings on the
example of the Commune. "Marx is a centralist and in his explanations
cited here there is no deviation from centralism" ("State and
Revolution"). Quite correctly so, but Lenin omits to mention at this
point that Marx's exposition of the Paris Commune is also everything
else but a historically correct characterization of the revolutionary
commune constitution aspired to by the Paris communardes and
realized in the first beginnings.</p>

<p>In order to deflect from the federative and anti-centralist
character of the Paris Commune as much as possible, Marx and Engels;
and likewise Lenin, have emphasized above all else the negative aspect,
that it represents as such the <span style="font-style: italic;">destruction of the prevailing
bourgeois state power</span>. On this point there is no quarrel among
revolutionaries. Marx, Engels, and Lenin have justly emphasized that
the decisive foundation for the proletarian revolutionary
character of the form of political supreme power as stated by the
Commune is to be sought in its societal being as a realization
of proletarian class dictatorship. They pointed out to their
"federalist" adversaries with great severity that the
<span style="font-style: italic;">decentralized, federative sidle form as such is quite as bourgeois as
the centralist form of government of the modern bourgeois state</span>. They
nevertheless committed the same error which they so strongly opposed in
their opponents, not by concentrating on the "federalist" character of
the communal constitution, but rather by emphasizing too much the other
<span style="font-style: italic;">formal differences which distinguished the Paris Commune from
parliamentarism and other surpassed forms of the bourgeois state
constitution</span> (for example, on the <span style="font-style: italic;">replacement of the standing army
through the militia, on the unification of executive and legislative
power, and on the responsibility and right of dismissal of "communal"
functionaries</span>). They thereby created a considerable confusion
of concepts out of which emerged not only harmful effects with regard
to the <span style="font-style: italic;">position of Marxism vis-&agrave;-vis the Paris commune, but
also likewise for the later positing of the revolutionary Marxist
direction vis-&agrave;-vis the new historical phenomenon of the
revolutionary council system.</span></p>

<p>As incorrect as it may be to see with Proudhon and Bakunin an
overcoming of the bourgeois state in the "federative" form, it
is just as incorrect when today some Marxist followers of the
revolutionary commune on the revolutionary council system
believe on the basis of such misunderstood explanations by Marx,
Engels, and Lenin that a parliamentary representative with a
short-term, binding mandate revocable at any time, or a government
functionary employed by private treaty for ordinary "wages," would be a
less bourgeois arrangement than an elected parliamentarian. It is
completely erroneous when they believe that there are any "communal" or
"council-like" forms of constitution whose introduction may
cause the state governed by the revolutionary proletarian party in the
end to relinquish completely that character of an instrument of class
suppression which adheres to every state. The whole theory of the final
"withering away of the state in Communist society," taken over by Marx
and Engels out of the tradition of utopian socialism and further
developed on the basis of practical experiences of the proletarian
class struggle in their time, loses its revolutionary meaning when one
declares with Lenin that there is a state where the minority does not
suppress anymore the majority, but rather "the majority of the
people themselves suppress their own suppressors"; <span style="font-style: italic;">and such a state of
proletarian dictatorship then in its capacity as
&ldquo;fulfiller&rdquo; of true or proletarian democracy "is
already a withering away of the state</span>" ("State and Revolution").</p>

<p>It is high time again to posit with full clarity the two <span style="font-style: italic;">basic
theories</span> of the real revolutionary proletarian theory which by
<span style="font-style: italic;">temporary adapting</span> to practical requirements of such certain phases of
struggle as the Paris Commune insurrection of 1871 and the Russian
October Revolution of 1917 in the end ran into danger of being
abrogated. The essential final goal of proletarian class struggle is
not anyone <span style="font-style: italic;">state</span>, however "democratic," "communal," or even
"council-like," but is rather the classless and stateless Communist
<span style="font-style: italic;">society</span> whose comprehensive <span style="font-style: italic;">form</span> is not any longer some kind of
political power but is "<span style="font-style: italic;">that association in which the free development
of every person is the condition for the free development of
all</span>" ("Communist Manifesto").</p>

<p>Irrespective of whether the proletarian class can "conquer"
more or less unchanged the surpassed state apparatus following the
illusion of the Marxist reformists, or whether it can only really
appropriate it according to revolutionary Marxist theory by
radically "<span style="font-style: italic;">smashing</span>" its surpassed form and <span style="font-style: italic;">"replacing" it
through a new voluntary created form - until then</span>, in either case this
state will <span style="font-style: italic;">differ from the bourgeois state</span> in the period of
revolutionary transformation of capitalist into Communist
society only <span style="font-style: italic;">through its class nature and its social function, but not
through its political form. "The true secret of the revolutionary
commune, the revolutionary council system, and every other historical
manifestation of government of the working class exists in this social
content and not in anyone artificially devised political form</span> or in
such special institutions as may once have been realized under some
particular historical circumstances.</p>
