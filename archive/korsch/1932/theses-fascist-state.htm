<h3>1. Exposition</h3>

<p>"The modern state, whatever its form may be, is essentially a
capitalist machine, the state of the capitalists, the ideal aggregate
capitalist" (Engels, <span style="font-style: italic;">Socialism: Scientific and Utopian</span>)</p>

<p>1. The fascist state is a modern state. It does not signify a return to
pre-bourgeois state structures. The corporative state has nothing to do
with the "state of estates"-fascism as "counter-reform."</p>

<p>2. The fascist conception of state is grounded in the negation
of the early bourgeois ideal of the state. It signifies disillusionment
vis-&agrave;-vis the political ideals of liberalism and socialism
of all directions. It takes over the criticism by the restoration,
Marxism, and syndicalism (Proudhon/ Sorel) of the political
institutions and ideals of the early bourgeois epoch.</p>

<p>3. This does not contradict but rather corresponds to the
conscious statement of a new state-mythos. Fascism unites in Pareto's
sense a sober illusion-free, rational goal-directed state practice
(carried out by the "elite") with a completely irrational state
mythology (represented by the state's people, the race, and the mass). </p>

<h3>2. Immanent Critique</h3>

<p>"Monopoly begets competition, competition begets monopoly .... the
synthesis is of such nature that monopoly can only maintain itself by
constantly entering into the competitive struggle" (Marx, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Poverty
of Philosophy</span>)</p>

<p>1. As the stabilization of inter-capitalist contradictions by the state
shipwrecked the previous period on the basis of competition in the form
of parliamentary and democracy, so now it shipwrecks upon the
inevitable breaking through of capitalist group and individual
interests and falls into the form of dictatorship and corporative
constitution on the basis of monopoly: the monopolization of state
power by the monopolistic grand bourgeoisie takes the place of the
"ideal aggregate capitalist."</p>

<p>2. The production of the "ideal aggregate capitalist" on a national
basis is at the present phase already being thwarted by the direct
international tendency of capitalism. Thus one has to understand
the present reformation of fascism as an "export commodity," the
expansion of the opposition Italy-France to the opposition
Europe-America.</p>

<p>3. The monopolistic claim of the fascist state authority enters into
competition with the old authoritarian forces, particularly with the
claim to authority by Catholicism which is independent of that state
authority.</p>

<h3>3. Transcendental Critique</h3>

<p>"But the struggle of class against class is a political
struggle" (Marx, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Poverty of Philosophy</span>)</p>

<p>1. The fascist remodelling does not mean an economic revolution or
radical dissolution of the old relations of production or the freeing
of new productive forces. This is the main difference between fascism
and Bolshevism- apart from given distinctions of material possibilities
and order of magnitude.</p>

<p>2. The fascist state signifies the union of the economic and political
power of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat; thus not the
overcoming of the class-state, but the restoration of the class-state
in the form of the class-state.</p>

<p>3. The new form of union of the economic and political class power of
the bourgeoisie in the fascist "total state" demands new forms of
combining the economic and political action of the proletariat.</p>
