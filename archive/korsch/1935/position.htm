<p>In the time after Lenin's death and after the current
"stabilization" of capital domination on a world-wide scale, and the
year's long "prosperity" in some countries, especially the USA, many
people have newly come to "communism" or "Soviet Russia" who cannot at
all understand the critique of today's Russia and the Communist party
which we developed in the first decade of the Revolution 1917-1927.
These people, whom I have for a long time designated in conversations
as the "second wave of conscripts of Leninism," have themselves never
been united with the revolution of the Russian workers as a direct
component of a world revolutionary movement of which they themselves
participated. Rather, they are aroused by the "new Russia" and its
leading Bolshevik party, with its "five year plans," with its cultural
progressiveness in pedagogical fields, law, art, and film, which have
arisen from the Russian Revolution in its consequently forced national
limitation to the Russian <span style="font-style: italic;">state</span>, and which still has continuing
vitality as a powerful revolutionary movement. They see that in Russia
another group has risen to power, influence, and effectiveness than in
the old European and American world, and to be sure another group with
which the new Communists or "friends of the new Russia" to whom I am
referring, can more easily identify with than with the previous type of
leader in their own land, or the new fascist type of leader who is
advancing toward this position in some lands (and who belongs to the
historical group of a still older human type). The new friends of
communism have in a sense the same relation to the new Russian state
that Hegel once represented in regard to the new Prussian state: "We
are today so advanced that we can only hold as valid Ideas and that
which has arisen from Reason. More closely seen, the Prussian State
corresponds to Reason."</p>

<p>The application of the Hegelian principle "what is real is
rational" to today's Russian state, and the Communist parties which are
related to it and supported by it in other lands, holds not only for
that universally freedom loving and progressive layer from which in a
time of a rising revolutionary movement the struggling proletariat
received reinforcement, support, and the widening of its front, but to
a certain extent holds also for the workers themselves. <span style="font-style: italic;">One cannot
protest against a reality simply in the name of an abstract principle</span>.
There is today nowhere in the world any longer an organization of
revolutionary-inclined workers, or even a "direction" which really
embodies in itself revolution as a spiritual ideal, which one can
oppose as the truly revolutionary movement to the "degenerated" Russian
Communist party, which "puts the national state interest above the
international proletarian class interest." If the belief in "the
construction of socialism in Soviet Russia" is only a metaphysical
consolation, a myth, or a revolutionary faith-in-the-beyond
(Jenseits-Glaubigkeit) for the workers of countries outside of Russia
who are attracted by communism, this faith-in-the-beyond no longer
today confronts a revolutionary here-and-now (Diesseitigkeit) in any
intelligible form. The Russian Revolution from February and October,
1917, and in the following years, was, considered purely as a movement,
the proletarian movement that most involved the masses in the entire
previous history. It destroyed the tsarist state and demolished the old
capitalist ruling Class. In all other lands the workers were either
defeated or in cruel ways were robbed of all previously won positions,
through sharpened pressure from outside and through increasing decay
from within.</p>

<p>Everywhere the workers are threatened by the present economic
crisis, into which in some countries already a sharpening of
exploitation and oppression has entered, and the destruction of all
remains of an independent proletarian class movement and even a class
consciousness through fascism. Everything that the workers are told
about the state-capitalist continuation, restoration and sharpening of
already developed forms of capitalist oppression and exploitation in
Russia, comes either from the mouths of their old well-known enemies,
capitalists, fascists, and social democrats or it unavoidably remains
extremely vague, abstract, incomprehensible, and unsympathetic. All
these critiques do not contain and cannot at this time contain any sort
of call to action for revolutionary workers. For all these reasons it
is unavoidable that up until the rise of a new, independent class
movement of the international proletariat, even the working class
itself and precisely its most revolutionary components can look at
today's Soviet Russia as the <span style="font-style: italic;">real</span> and thence <span style="font-style: italic;">revolutionary</span> rational
implementation of the posited goals that are today still not
implemented in their own countries.</p>
