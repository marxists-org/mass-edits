<p>The first question to be put with reference to the statement of principles of 
a revolutionary labor party has to do with whether and how far that program 
really <i>breaks</i> with the existing capitalist order of society. The A.W.P. 
is not lacking in the subjective <i>will</i> to make that break. It rejects not 
only the hitherto existing form of the bourgeois social order and its economic 
foundation, but also the previous and future forms of the Rooseveltian New Deal 
inclusive of inflation, &#8220;social credit&#8221;, and &#8220;state socialism&#8221;; it recognizes 
Fascism as merely an attempt to save the capitalist State and property, and lays 
bare within the Roosevelt administration the clearly arising tendencies to 
fascism. It rejects the traditional American concept of &#8220;politics&#8221; and the 
replacement of the real political movement by the parliamentary electoral 
movement. It proclaims a new type of State in the form of the workers' state 
based on workers' councils as a democratic instrument for solving the 
contradictions of the capitalist system and for accomplishing the transition to 
the communist society. It takes the standpoint of an unconditional revolutionary 
internationalism of the labor movement; and it separates itself from the 
Communist International because primarily this organization is &#8220;completely and 
mechanically&#8221; controlled by the Russian party and serviceable to the changing 
official interests of the Soviet Union so that the identity of its tasks with 
the immediate tasks of the international struggle of the working class is no 
longer unconditionally and at every moment guaranteed. In its economic analysis 
it decisively takes the position that even though the present world crisis may 
be temporarily &#8220;overcome&#8221;, the <i>decline of the capitalist system</i> is no 
longer reversible, and it regards the present crisis as the &#8220;<i>beginning of the 
end of the present form of society</i>&#8221;. It makes the claim of having recognized 
the nature of the impending revolutionary change and of having the capacity for 
the correct carrying through of the revolutionary proletarian class struggle and 
for the setting up of a free workers' democracy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the present draft program does <i>not</i>
contain the break with the capitalist social order and all present and future 
further developments of that order. Even in the <i>economic part of the program</i>
there is a striking gap, in that nowhere is there any attempt to come to grips 
with the concept of planned economy, and much less is the fundamentally 
capitalist-fascist character of all present day talk and pretense of so-called 
planned economy decisively pointed out. The draft speaks of &#8220;planned economy&#8221; 
only in two places. In the one it is taken for granted that a &#8220;planned socialist 
economy&#8221; exists and is making headway in the Soviet Union; and although in the 
next paragraph there is express mention of the &#8220;compromises&#8221; forced upon Russia 
even in the economic sphere and a statement of the impossibility of building a 
socialist economy in the Soviet Union alone, there is not a word of explanation 
as to why and to what extent the <i>unlimitedly socialist</i> character of the 
Russian planned economy accords with these compromises and impossibilities and 
in what that character consists. In the other passage which reveals a lack of 
clarity almost reminiscent of the Rooseveltian and Hitlerian &#8220;economic 
planning&#8221;, we read that the future workers' State issuing from the victorious 
revolution is destined &#8220;to undertake great projects of social reconstruction by 
the planned economy of the new society&#8221;. To this unsatisfactory treatment of the 
concept of planned economy may be added the ambiguous manner in which, 
immediately thereafter, in the section on &#8220;Socialization&#8221;, there is demanded 
only the expropriation of all &#8220;<i>monopolies</i> in industry and land&#8221;. In view 
of the monopolistic character of all capitalist property, that may, on the one 
hand, mean complete socialization. On the other hand, many doors remain open for 
limiting the &#8220;socialization&#8221; to the so-called monopolies after the manner of the 
&#8220;socialization program&#8221; of the German and Austrian Social Democracy from 1918 to 
1933, or even according to the still further watered proposals of the 
new-socialist post-war &#8220;socialism&#8221; (de Man's &#8220;Plan d&#8217;action&#8221;).</p>

<p>Thus in the very incompleteness and ambiguity of the economic demands it 
becomes manifest that the carrying out of this program might require, instead of 
the revolutionary attack upon the <i>whole</i>
of capital, possibly only one or another partial attack. Likewise the lack of 
theoretical clarity at the basis of these demands is <i>proved</i> by the form 
in which (in the last paragraph of the first chapter) &#8220;the central 
contradiction&#8221; of the capitalist system and its &#8220;solution&#8221; are defined:</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The central contradiction is unmistakably clear; 
it is the contradiction between a productive plant (!) now physically capable of 
supplying amply all the basic needs of men, of freeing men forever from hunger, 
want and insecurity, of assuring mankind as a whole thereby full and creative 
life - between this and a system of social relations that prevents this 
productive plant from operating effectively, that directs its operations not to 
the fulfillment of human needs but to the making of profits for private 
individuals and corporations. Out of this contradiction and the irreconcilable 
class divisions it creates, flow the many other contradictions that devastate 
modern society.&#8221;</p>

<p>What is here proclaimed is not the Marxist and revolutionary basic 
contradiction between the productive <i>forces</i> and productive relations and 
(what is strictly identical with this economic contradiction) the historical, 
social and practical <i>contradiction and struggle</i>
between the possessing class (interested in maintaining the present relations of 
production) and the non-possessing proletarian class (interested in overthrowing 
the present relations of production), a class which, according to Marx, is &#8220;<i>itself 
the strongest productive force</i>&#8221;. Rather it is here asserted, after the 
fashion of Stuart Chase and other modern apostles of capitalist planned economy, 
that, even today, under capitalism itself, a new epoch has set in, in which 
&#8220;scarcity production&#8221; could be replaced by &#8220;plenty production&#8221; if only the 
present productive apparatus were no longer capitalistically misused but humanly 
used. As if the capitalist mode of production had not ever been at the same time 
the production of &#8216;plenty&#8217; and the production of &#8216;scarcity&#8217; and ever the one 
only through the medium of the other! As if the root of the capitalistic evil 
lay, not in production itself and in the capitalistic <i>fettering of the 
productive forces</i>
(i.e. in the capitalistic suppression of the productive forces which could be 
released through the socialist mode of production and which even now, in the 
proletarian class struggle, are rebelling against the capitalistic relations of 
production) but only in an avoidable misdirection of this production, in the 
misuse of the available productive apparatus and in an improper <i>distribution</i>! 
The basic contradiction of capitalist society is not between the available 
productive apparatus and the productive relations. Rather is this whole material
<i>productive apparatus</i> (the technical equipment of the industries), this 
whole enormous apparatus with its capacity which in times of peace, even in boom 
periods, is no longer completely used and which lies idle during the crisis - 
this apparatus is nevertheless, if one will only take into consideration also 
the &#8220;normal condition&#8221; of war, still today completely adapted to the 
capitalistic property relations. This adaptedness exists even for the wage 
workers and for the now rapidly increasing mass of those who are temporarily and 
chronically unoccupied.</p>

<p>Just as in the capitalistic division of labor the productive workers are 
assimilated in the most exact manner to their means of production, the 
&#8220;part-worker&#8221; to his &#8216;tool&#8217; and the laboring man has become a mere appendage of 
the machine, so the growing army of <i>unemployed</i>, even in its long-known 
quality of the &#8220;industrial reserve army&#8221; of capital in peace and the more so in 
its new quality (now grown important) of the <i>&#8220;military reserve army&#8221; of 
capital in war</i>, forms in its functions an exactly determinate component of 
the equipment of the present-day capitalist mode of production. Anyone who takes 
as his starting point the means of production which are actually at hand must 
logically not only renounce the proletarian revolution in favor of a 
capitalistic <i>reform</i>, but in the end capitulate before fascism. The 
present capacity of production in its capitalistic form, computed by such 
theoreticians as the Technocrats and Stuart Chase is given by the existence of 
the means of production, by the enormous capitalistic productive apparatus at 
hand. When confronted with the storms to which the world market is subjected as 
a result of the <i>crisis</i> with the ravages of an &#8220;unregulated&#8221; <i>
competition</i>
on and, last not least, with the unavoidable rebellions on the part of the 
suppressed and exploited <i>workers</i> and of the growing mass of <i>
under-workers</i>
who are &#8220;planfully&#8221; left jobless in time of peace, that productive capacity can 
be protected only by means of the <i>strong State</i>, by which this technical 
foundation of capitalism is protected under all circumstances in war and in 
peace and defended with all ordinary and extraordinary means against all attacks 
of the workers as well as of the individual capitalists and special capitalist 
groups. That is the feeling today of the bourgeoisie, even where it itself 
suffers under fascism, and that is the feeling of a large and growing part of 
the people and of the peoples, even deep into the ranks of the workers and of 
the unemployed under-workers. The sophism at the bottom of all this, the 
deceptiveness of the illusion that the strong state of a Hitler or Mussolini or 
Roosevelt could really solve this problem, and the insufficiency of this static 
and evolutionary goal itself can be illuminated only when the basic 
contradiction is seen not from the material side in the relation between <i>
productive means (apparatus) and the productive relations</i>, but from the 
human side in the relation between the <i>productive forces</i> which are 
potentially present in the <i>working population</i> and the present <i>
capitalistic relations of production</i> (which are in full accord with the 
productive apparatus). The modern working class, which has developed upward, not 
without the capitalistic means of production, but with them and thru them to the 
present level of its economic and historico-social-practical productive power, 
but which in increasing clarity of consciousness is already separable from those 
means of production and can already be joined to them ideologically in new 
socialist forms - the modern working class represents that &#8220;strongest force of 
production&#8221; which in its advancing development comes in ever increasing 
revolutionary contradictions with the fixed capitalistic productive relations, 
property relations, distribution relations, their State, law and all their 
ideologies. Its own State, the proletarian workers' State, is the strong State 
of which today fascists and half-fascists technocrats and Stuart Chasists dream 
only in a confused manner, but which becomes actual through the unfettering of 
that strongest revolutionary productive force which even today is the 
proletarian class itself, through the bursting of those fetters which even today 
is capital itself, and through the violent solution in the international 
proletarian revolution, of the sharpening basic contradiction existing between 
the two.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to say that this, the real meaning of the Marxist 
doctrine on the basic contradiction of capitalist economy was misunderstood by 
the authors of the program. There are Marxian &#8220;materialists&#8221; who look upon the 
Marxist doctrine of the &#8220;<i>productive character of the proletariat itself</i>&#8221; 
as an &#8220;idealistic&#8221; deviation of the master from his own materialism. This draft 
program is in general far remote from such dogmatic narrowness. Still less is it 
my design to base this whole criticism, say, on the single phrase &#8220;productive 
plant.&#8221; But the whole passage above quoted, which occupies a decisive position 
in the program, is saturated even in its style with those only apparently 
revolutionary, in reality superficial ideas which today are disseminated by the 
voluntary and involuntary pacemakers of the fascist counter-revolution regarding 
the possibility of a New Deal through a mere transformation of distribution and 
a few &#8220;planned-economic&#8221; invasions into the present system of production. Even 
where the program brings out, with a decisiveness not hitherto attained in any 
socialist program, the special significance of the industrial workers and 
particularly of the &#8220;basic industry workers&#8221;, for whom the revolutionary 
solution is pointed to as the only way out because their very situation in life, 
it defines as the goal of this action the creation of a condition in which &#8220;the 
shops run to serve the needs of society and not to make a profit for private 
individuals and corporations. This, and this only, will release the machinery 
now braked by the overload of capital debt and the impossibility of finding 
solvent purchasers for commodities&#8221;. This ostensibly revolutionary goal of the 
basic industry workers can today, in the exigencies of the crisis, be taken over 
even by the capitalist who is threatened with bankruptcy, and in Germany we find 
Hitler shouting: &#8220;The general welfare comes before private welfare&#8221;!</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h4>The &#8220;Revolutionary Parliamentarism&#8221; of the A.W.P.</h4>

<p>In the criticism of the <i>political</i> part of the draft program, I take as 
my starting point the view (won through study of the program and press of the 
A.W.P.) that the A.W.P. at its present stage of development is not yet a 
directly revolutionary party but is merely on the way &#8220;toward an American 
Revolutionary Labor Movement&#8221;. This becomes evident even from the external 
division of the program, where the <i>aims</i> of the party are treated quite 
separately from the <i>means and methods</i> which in the present and immediate 
future it thinks of employing in its &#8220;struggle for power&#8221;. The second chapter 
which treats of &#8220;the aim of the A.W.P.&#8221; is immediately followed by an 
intercalated third chapter which gives a criticism of the other labor parties 
and should really stand as an annex at the end of the program; and it is only in 
the fourth and last chapter that we get the answer to the question, &#8220;How the AWP 
will fight for Power&#8221;. The significance of this sharp separation between the 
so-called &#8220;final goal&#8221; (questions of the maximal program, questions of the 
program of principles) and the so-called &#8220;present tasks&#8221; or &#8220;transitional 
slogans&#8221; (questions of the minimal program, questions of the program of action) 
is sufficiently well known to anyone familiar with the Marxist movement from the 
history of the European labor parties of pre-war times. Such a party is (at the 
best) revolutionary in its theory and in the meaning which it theoretically 
assigns to its present actions and to the connection between them; it is also 
revolutionary in its practical <i>tendency</i> - more or less directed to the 
&#8220;final goal&#8221; - and it may in a certain measure, even in its present practice, 
fulfill that role which the Communist Manifesto of 1847-48 had once proclaimed 
for the Communists: namely, that they &#8220;represent in the present-day movement at 
the same time the future of the movement&quot; or (what merely concretizes the same 
thing from two directions and in another form) that they represent in the 
national at the same time the international movement and in the political at the 
same time the economic and social movement on which it is based. It is not yet 
able, however, whether from objective causes, based on the outer development, or 
from subjective causes, based on its own development, to combine its different 
activities, distributed over different spheres and time intervals, among each 
other and with all the other actions of the proletarian class into the cohesive 
whole of <i>one</i>
revolutionary action.</p>

<p>Where such a situation is given - and that this applies to the A.W.P. to its 
own character and its position within the present-day American labor movement is 
clearly proved, in my opinion, by the present draft program - it would be 
improper to take this standpoint of a &#8220;pure&#8221; and total revolutionary ideology 
and to regard the difference between the final slogans and the present demand of 
the program offhand, as so many &#8220;contradictions&#8221; and &#8220;inconsistencies&#8221;, or to 
deny to the party question any sort of &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; character because of the 
limitedness of its immediate practical tasks. The critic of such a program, and 
particularly the outside critic, must rather set out from the disconnectedness 
and transitional character of such a program as from a given fact. He must 
confine himself to pointing out the cases in which as a result of this (within 
certain limits unavoidable) division between future aims and present means and 
methods of the struggle, the <i>revolutionary development</i>
of the party, oriented in its actions on this program, is hindered and 
endangered. He can protest when the revolutionary theory degenerates to a mere 
ideology, to the ideological cloak for an actually opportunistic practice, and 
he can prove that in certain cases, as a result of the peculiarly 
&nbsp;&#8220;revolutionary&#8221; position of the party on a certain form of proletarian 
activity, the present force of this proletarian activity is in reality weakened 
and its future revolutionary development fettered, while with an apparently less 
revolutionary attitude together with maximum intensification of the present 
activity the way for a really revolutionary further development is much better 
kept open.</p>

<p>The given starting points for such a criticism, one which is not 
ideologically doctrinaire but realistically revolutionary, is offered by the 
position taken in the program, on the one hand, to the question of <i>
parliamentarism</i>, and on the other to the question of <i>trade unions</i>.</p>

<p>All the mistakes committed in the earlier development of the Marxist parties 
in Europe and there already shown up by reality are brought together with 
encyclopedic completeness in the program's attitude to <i>participation in 
elections</i>. It is not a matter of criticizing the decision adopted by the 
party in this field of tactics. A sober exposition of mere grounds of 
expediency, which make participation in elections a transitorily unavoidable 
necessity in present-day America, even for a proletarian and in its tendency 
revolutionary party, would suffice if not to refute all the fundamental 
objections which might arise against the tactical decision, at least to make 
them practically of no account. Instead of that, the present draft program has, 
in the first place, taken a position on this question which is thoroly 
contradictory - and this is by no means a <i>dialectical</i> contradiction, 
brought about thru the relation between final goal and present tasks, but a 
simple and direct contradiction arising thru unclear and inconsistent thinking 
and speaking. It has, furthermore, at the place where after long beating about 
the bush in the very last section of the program the practical decision is now 
really taken, it has forthwith added on to this opportunistic decision an 
ideological and apologetic illusionary and <i>&#8220;revolutionary&#8221; justification </i>
by which itself and in addition to other or others are deceived. In doing so, it 
has decided not simply for parliamentary activity of the party, but has rather 
taken up with that thoroly unreal monster of a so-called <i>&#8220;revolutionary 
parliamentarism&#8221;</i> the nothingness of which has been proved by the previous 
experience of all Marxist parties in Germany and in all other European countries 
before and since the war, a something which, after the close of that historical 
period in which the Parliament constituted for the bourgeois revolution itself a 
means of struggle and not yet a mere means for coordinating the different 
competing class interests within the bourgeoisie, hence in the entire epoch of 
the beginning proletarian revolution has actually never and nowhere existed and 
which likewise will by no means exist for the present and future America now 
entering upon the era of the final struggle between revolution and 
counter-revolution, democracy and fascism, socialism and capitalism.</p>

<p>Because of the importance of the matter, I shall sketch in some detail the 
different stages by which in this program a revolutionary principle, which from 
the very beginning is formulated ambiguously becomes converted into a mere 
revolutionary phrase.</p>

<p>As early as the second chapter (which in itself is not concerned with present 
practice, but only with the &#8220;goal&#8221; of the party) we get some remarkable 
phraseology concerning the allegedly &#8220;common aims of all political parties&#8221; &#8211; as 
if (and particularly from the viewpoint of the revolutionary final goal) there 
could be such a common character of proletarian and capitalist parties even for 
a moment. The program itself describes in detail, in two special sections, &#8220;The 
Nature of the Capitalist Dictatorship&#8221; as the rule of a minority and the 
technique by which the capitalist class imposes this rule upon the great 
majority of the people and of the working class with all forceful means, direct 
and indirect.</p>

<p>This exposition is counterbalanced in the next section by &quot;The Specific Aims 
of a Revolutionary Party&quot;, and on this occasion, if words have any meaning, 
parliamentary action as a possible means for the attainment of even the smallest 
part of these specific aims is radically rejected. This rejection begins - still 
somewhat weakly - with the observation that the A.W.P., to be sure, <i>like</i> 
the capitalist parties aims at the conquest and consolidation of state power, 
but that, <i>unlike</i> the capitalist parties, it regards this measure &#8220;merely 
as an essential (!) step to fundamentally changing the whole order of society&#8221;. 
It wants to bring this about &#8220;<i>not by stepping into state power, the 
Presidency or Congress, but by doing away with the present basis of state power 
entirely</i>&#8221;. The whole exposition immediately following reaches its climax in 
the result that in the given conditions of the political dictatorship of 
capital, resting upon the economic and social class character of the capitalist 
order, it would be utopian for the workers to believe that they could take over 
the state power along parliamentary paths. To this end, the working class would 
rather require other, newly forged weapons. The united action of the working 
class organizations must provide the basis for the construction of truly united 
revolutionary working-class organizations; the workers' councils which carry 
through the struggle for power &#8220;with all means&#8221;.</p>

<p>But all the theoretical clarity which with these formulations seems at first 
to be won, not only for an action lying in the remote future, but in tendency 
also for the present notion of the revolutionary labor party - that becomes 
illusory through the statements of the fourth chapter by which they are 
irreconcilably opposed. Here we find, in the next to the last section, devoted 
to the &#8220;United Front&#8221;, the remarkable inversion of the real relation between a 
genuine workers' united front and the revolutionary seizure and exercise of 
power through the workers' councils; namely, that the united front is not 
denoted as a breeding ground for the workers' councils but inversely &#8220;the <i>
so-called</i>
(why only so-called?) <i>workers' councils</i>&#8221; as merely &#8220;the most highly 
developed form of the united front&#8221;. But this little discrepancy between the 
fourth and the second chapter completely disappears before the magnitude of the 
catastrophic downfall which now comes about in the last section of this chapter, 
on the last page of this whole program. &nbsp;Once more in this section, which is 
headed &#8220;Participation in Elections&#8221;, but this time in a much more circumspect 
and reserved fashion, the &#8220;movement to the ballot box&#8221; is denoted as &#8220;in the 
last instance (!) not (!) the (!) most important (!) form (!)&#8221; of the political 
mass-movement. This reservation now serves merely as a transition to the pompous 
observation: &#8220;<i>This does not mean that the AWP will neglect the traditional 
methods of American politics</i>&#8221;. It will rather - the dam is now broken, and 
the floods so long held up rush back boisterously into their old accustomed 
course &#8211; &#8220;wherever and whenever possible, participate in local, state and 
national elections, and will fight to win elections&#8221;.</p>

<p>Now to the justification of this tactic there march up, one behind the other, 
all those well-known ideological pseudo-reasons which in Germany and elsewhere 
have over and over again been thoroly deprived of force. Beginning with the 
&#8220;revolutionary&#8221; possibilities of the election struggle as a tribune for 
propagating the aims and program of the party and for uncovering the misleading 
and concealing manoeuvers of the opponents, and ending with those &#8220;strategic 
positions&#8221; into which the various elected party members will be placed through 
this election allegedly for the support of the organization and of the workers' 
struggles and for breaking down the capitalistic control over the State and for 
the public pillorying of the fraudulent government politics. One sees that the 
revolutionary &#8220;theory&#8221; of the basic part of the party program and especially the 
solemn promise &#8220;not to step into state office, the Presidency or Congress&#8221; is 
here actually reduced to a pure ideology of concealment, which enables the party 
also on its own account to faithfully carry on &#8220;the traditional methods of 
American politics&#8221;.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h4>The Trade-Union Policy of the A.W.P.</h4>

<p>In the <i>trade-union question</i> also there is a contradiction between the 
theoretical position of the A.W.P. as consciously proclaimed in the program, and 
its actual practice as shown by the previous and continuing development of the 
party and as it receives at least an indirect expression in the concrete 
positions taken in the program on the questions of the present-day American 
trade-union organization and tactic. In its actual practice and in all concrete 
questions, the A.W.P., which in its past &#8220;has functioned primarily in the 
economic conflicts of the American labor scene&#8221;, recognizes even yet today the 
peculiar and independent significance of the economic and social struggles of 
the working class and renounces expressly not only a &#8220;mechanical&#8221; but actually 
also any other form of rule over the trade-union organizations and the 
subordination of their special aims to the &#8220;higher&#8221; aims of the &#8220;politics&#8221; 
carried on by the &#8220;Party&#8221;. In its theoretical position on the trade-union 
question, however, it takes its stand on that theory which in the best case 
(Lenin) is <i>jacobinical-revolutionary</i>
and in the worse case (the German Social Democracy and other marxist parties of 
pre-war time) is simply <i>bourgeois</i>; namely, the primacy of politics over 
economics and of the political over the trade-union struggle. While it rightly 
reproaches the American Social Democracy with drawing too sharp and arbitrary a 
line of separation between the political and economic labor struggle, with 
leaving the leadership of the latter completely in the hands of the 
ultra-reformist bureaucracy of the A.F. of L. and with supporting in the 
trade-unions in all cases the reactionary measures of the right -wing 
bureaucracy against the progressive tendencies within the trade unions, still in 
the formulations of principle of its draft program the A.W.P. itself falls into 
the opposite one-sidedness. One may say that in the American labor movement of 
the present time the Socialist Party repeats the <i>actual development</i>, 
while the A.W.P. repeats the <i>ideology
</i>of the German Social Democracy of pre- and post-war time, where the true 
relation between Party and trade unions was even then mirrored inversely.</p>

<p>In a sharp break with the actual character which it has previously revealed, 
the A.W.P. today wants to be above all a &#8220;<i>political</i>&#8221; party. For this 
reason it wishes to give a strictly political orientation not only to all its 
own activities, but in an extraordinarily abstract fashion to subordinate all 
other activities of the working class to this political activity of the Party. 
All other class organization of the fighting proletariat appear accordingly, 
even in this new program, under the bad and unspecific general name of &#8220;mass 
organizations&#8221; (to be won by the party). Even the trade unions, which in reality 
represent a peculiar and independent basic form of the proletarian class 
organization not replaceable by the party, come under this theoretical 
viewpoint. In the present draft program they are treated as, to be sure, most 
important but yet only of equal rank with the other &#8220;mass organizations&#8221; (by the 
side of farmers, negroes, professional workers and unemployed), thru which the 
Party, mainly bent upon its own narrower political party tasks, strives to 
extend and strengthen its influence in a secondary way. Though in this 
connection the overwhelming importance of the industrial workers and especially 
of the &#8220;workers in the large shops, mills, factories and mines of the basic 
industries&#8221; is correctly emphasized, yet immediately following, with a somewhat 
striking &#8220;idealism&#8221;, the <i>actual winning</i> of precisely these most important 
workers is practically set equal to the purely ideological task of their <i>
merely theoretical attraction into the inner orientation of the Party</i>. The 
program says that the A.W.P. wants to support itself &#8220;in a two-fold sense&#8221; on 
these industrial workers. It wants to win their membership, their confidence and 
influential positions in their organizations; but even though the actual 
progress aimed at in this way among the industrial workers were to be slight, 
the A.W.P. wants to &#8220;make the needs and the historical position of these workers 
the <i>viewpoint</i>
of its theoretical orientation&#8221;. This &#8220;idealistic&#8221; turn of speech is not only 
suspiciously reminiscent of the manner of a merely parliamentary and electoral 
party, which also ever takes care to put the needs and the situation of broad 
masses of voters &#8220;in the mid-point of its orientation&#8221;. It also shows very 
clearly the insufficiency of such a merely formal attitude of the political 
party of the proletariat to all activities of the proletarian class struggle 
which are not or &#8220;not yet&#8221; politically formed.</p>

<p>Now of course the A.W.P. in this very profession of allegiance to the <i>
primacy of politics over economics</i> and to the superiority of the conscious 
political struggle of the <i>Party</i> over all other less developed forms of 
the proletarian fight for emancipation, has wished to profess allegiance to that 
revolutionary conception of the relation between economics and politics, party 
and trade unions, which since Lenin and Trotsky is regarded as the true Marxist 
position on the trade-union question. The A.W.P. wants in its turn to repeat 
that great struggle which Lenin, around the turn of the century, carried through 
in Russia and on an international scale against the &#8220;Economists&#8221; and to restore 
to honor that famous phrase of the Communist Manifesto which states that in the 
last instance &#8220;every class struggle is a political struggle&#8221;. It quite correctly 
recognizes behind the apparent bowing of the &#8220;Socialist Party&#8221; to the &#8220;trade 
unions&#8221; the real alliance of all backward instead of forward looking elements in <i>
party and trade unions</i>, and wants to set over against this <i>alliance of 
all reactionary elements</i> under the &#8220;hegemony&#8221; of the trade-union bureaucracy 
the <i>alliance of all progressive elements of the whole labor movement</i> 
under the leadership of the revolutionary party. Such a genuine combination of 
the economic and political struggle and of all other forms of activity of the 
working class into the single whole of a directly revolutionary struggle is the 
necessary goal of all proletarian revolutionists, regardless of whether they 
conceive this alliance in the &#8220;Leninist-Communist&#8221; manner as a bringing together 
of all isolated forms of struggle into the revolutionary political struggle or 
in the &#8220;syndicalist&#8221; manner as an extension and intensification of the direct 
economic action into the single whole of a <i>directly revolutionary and social 
struggle</i>. On this point there scarcely remains in the revolutionary 
end-result a single difference between the two tendencies which today are 
competing with and warring upon each other. The very same Marx who called every 
class struggle a &#8220;<i>political struggle</i>&#8221; has also in exactly the same sense 
called politics a &#8220;<i>concentrated economics</i>&#8221;. The coincidence of the two 
conceptions regarding the relation of the economic to the political class 
struggle first practically comes about, however, in the moment or in the period 
when, in the direct revolutionary action of the workers' councils, economics and 
politics actually coalesce. Until that time the claim to hegemony put forth by 
both of the tendencies, the &#8220;political&#8221; one of the Marxists and Leninists no 
less than the &#8220;economic&#8221; one of the syndicalists, contains a one-sidedness which 
restricts and weakens the practical class struggle of the proletariat. The 
identity which is present in the beginning of the economic and political class 
struggle of the workers can first be completely actualized in the full 
development of the directly revolutionary struggle. It can no more be brought 
about in advance through a merely formal &#8220;subordination&#8221; of the &#8220;trade union 
mass organizations&#8221; to the viewpoint of a revolutionary party than through the 
no less formal rejection of all &#8220;politics&#8221; in the other camp; and the <i>damage</i> 
unavoidably resulting from such an empty formalism strikes, as is especially 
clearly shown by the fate of the German Social Democracy, in the end not only 
and not even most severely the trade unions and the possible forms of 
organization to be &#8220;politicized&#8221; and &#8220;led&#8221; by the party in accordance with its 
&#8220;revolutionary&#8221; ideology, but also the party itself, just as in an earlier 
period with the German Social Democracy, so with the AWP even today there is 
concealed behind the ideologically raised claim to the primacy of the party over 
the trade unions, in reality the opposite practical tendency of subjecting its 
revolutionary political theory to the preponderance of the trade-union mass 
organizations and their practice, oriented to their own and by no means 
revolutionary interests. Such a germ of future capitulation is concealed, for 
example, behind the extraordinarily general declaration of the party against 
&#8220;any general policy of dual unionism&#8221; and the equally general assertion, added 
to this declaration as the only reason for it, that any &#8220;divided trade union 
movement opens the way for fascism&#8221;. This passage may be applicable to the 
policy of the Communist Party - a policy which is described immediately 
thereafter in considerably more concrete form - with its paper red unions bound 
to the line set by the party leadership, though even for this trade union policy 
of the C.P. the most fatal mistake - a point which the program completely 
overlooks &#8211; consisted in the fact that it has been an unprincipled tactic 
different for different countries and continually vacillating in the course of 
time and has accordingly been no more a consistent policy of <i>splitting</i>
the trade unions than a consistent policy of <i>conquering</i> them; but how can 
a revolutionary proletarian party in the USA - a party which is up in arms 
against the ineradicable reformism of the A.F. of L. bureaucracy, and at the 
same time has to ward off the new half-fascist tendency of the Roosevelt 
administration to turning the trade union movement into an instrument of state 
policy, and which furthermore propagates as the next stage of development to be 
aimed at with reference to workers' united front actions the forming of 
revolutionary workers' councils - how can such a party, in such a pompous manner 
resign itself to recognizing the now existing trade union organizations for all 
future time? In reality there is here revealed, in this first practical drawing 
back of the American Workers Party before the enormous difficulties of its 
theoretically proclaimed revolutionary tasks, the unavoidable developmental 
tendency of a political party which, instead of injecting itself as a definite 
part, fulfilling important part functions, into the existing working-class 
movement, comes forth with a &#8220;theoretical&#8221; claim to totality, in the name of a 
&#8220;revolutionary&#8221; theory which, under the given relations, is unavoidably 
converted into an ideological glorification of a much more limited practice, and 
behind which the process of reducing the revolutionary proletarian party to a 
bourgeois opposition party and its final destruction through the American 
Mussolini or Hitler can be accomplished the more readily.</p>
