<p>In analyzing these <a href="../../../../subject/left-wing/icc/1935/05/thesis.htm">theses</a>, one will do well to leave out entirely the first 
three paragraphs (i.e. Theses 1 and 2, the first paragraph of Thesis 3). They 
contain in part unsupported assertions (the &#8216;likely&#8217; coinciding of the next 
world crisis with the second world war), in part subjective experiences of the 
author (his &#8216;shock&#8217; at noting that the forces of revolution previously assembled 
are used up), in part an enumeration of the points to be clarified and defined 
in the Theses themselves. It is not until we come to the last sentence of this 
section (&#8220;We have mostly contented ourselves with explaining the causes of 
capitalist wars&#8221;, etc.) that we get something which serves as a real 
introduction to the analysis of the World War beginning immediately thereafter.
<p>With this omission, the structure of the Theses becomes quite clear. In the <i>
first part</i> (remainder of Thesis 3) is discussed the pre-history and history 
of the present crisis period setting in with the World War; in the <i>second 
part</i> (Theses 4 and 5) the further development after the &#8220;transition from the 
acute crisis into the depression&#8221; and the prospects for the next world crisis 
coinciding with the second world war. Thereupon follows as <i>third part</i>
(Thesis 6) the exposition of the &#8220;satisfactions&#8221; and &#8220;difficulties&#8221; arising from 
the new state of affairs and the tendencies revealed therein for the workers&#8217; 
world revolution, together with a backward glance at the &#8220;sluggishness which 
settled over the labor movement&#8221; prior to the present state of affairs, the 
cause of that sluggishness and the now visible overcoming of those causes.</p>

<p>This general glance of itself brings out a peculiarity of these Theses. The <i>
present world economic crisis</i> which has lasted since 1929 and which at least 
in some respects has kept on growing deeper and sharper, and in a certain sense 
even the &#8220;<i>present</i>&#8221; in general, in this analysis of the total situation of 
the labor movement of our time is quite left out of consideration. It is not 
with relation to this present-day crisis, but with relation to &#8220;the post-war 
crises&#8221;, or the &#8220;great world crises of the present time&#8221;, of which therefore the 
present crisis forms only a special example, that it is stated (in next to the 
last paragraph of Thesis 3) that in them, to be sure, there came to light, on 
the one hand the fettering character of the national-state social system resting 
on wage-labor and capital, but that on the other hand the effort to bind the 
productive forces once more to the production relation wage-labor and capital 
and to the capitalistic process of accumulation and to fit them into the 
framework of the national state was &#8220;attended with success.&#8221; Likewise in the 
last paragraph of Thesis 3, the &#8220;post-war crises (1921, 1929)&#8221; are, to be sure, 
on the one hand (in connection with the &#8220;present depression period&#8221;, following, 
in the cycle of the &#8220;'long wave&#8221;, upon the &#8220;upgrade period 1895-1913&#8221;) denoted 
as &#8220;crises of the system&#8221;, but on the other hand the idea of final crisis which 
such an expression seems to imply is forthwith dismissed by way of the following 
&#8220;expectation&#8221; that &#8220;the next world crisis will have the same character.&#8221; In the 
next sentence (Thesis 4) the &#8220;acute crisis&#8221; has already become no more than a 
thing of the past, from which the transition into the &#8220;depression period&#8221;, with 
a &#8220;breathing spell&#8221; following at the latest within a few years, is said to be 
already accomplished.</p>

<p>In the same way, everything that is said in these Theses regarding the 
situation, tasks, prospects and difficulties of the labor movement of our time 
is nowhere related to the <i>present</i>, but to the &#8220;next world crisis&#8221;, the 
&#8220;second world war&#8221;, (closing sentence of Thesis 5), and the therewith 
approaching &#8220;second world-revolutionary situation&#8221; (closing sentence of Thesis 
6). The Theses deal, that is, practically not at all with the actual present, 
which is passed over as quite uncertain and undeterminable, but with a
<i>future</i> computed, without any apparent basis, with complete certainty in 
terms of years: &#8220;There are no grounds by which we could be induced not to count 
upon the next world crisis around 1940 as upon a certain anticipation and to 
take our measures accordingly&#8221;. In reality, the author of the Theses could say 
at most, in view of his previous very general disquisitions, that if we have 
special positive grounds for anticipating the world crisis &#8220;around 1940&#8221;, no 
counter-reasons come forth from the presently visible general tendencies of 
economic development. But even apart from such special defects in the 
formulation and support of individual assertions, this <i>actual disregard of 
the real present and fictitious actualization of a &#8220;likely&#8221; revolutionary 
situation in the future</i>
is a blow at the very foundations of these Theses as regards their 
materialistic-practical character. The place of such a character is taken, on 
the one hand, by pure idealism and <i>idealistic subjectivism</i>, which sets 
its standpoint &#8220;over against&#8221; objective reality, and on the other hand, as the 
unavoidable polar supplement, by that <i>pseudo-materialistic objectivism</i> 
which speaks of the necessity of given historical processes in a too general 
manner, without &#8220;thereby&#8221; determining its standpoint.</p>

<p>While the <i>connection</i> between such hitherto always too isolatedly 
regarded phenomena as <i>world crisis, war and revolution</i>, or <i>Capital and 
State</i>, in modern monopoly-capitalist society, has been demonstrated in these 
Theses with much force from the <i>objective</i> side and represented in 
striking and sometimes new and original formulations, the practical task 
springing from this objective connection for the working class has been 
proclaimed only in abstract manner. The author contents himself in this respect 
with the simple repetition of the one phrase, &#8220;world revolution&#8221;, which now, 
however, from this <i>subjective</i> side, remains quite indeterminate and 
without content. We learn from him positively only one thing, namely, that as a 
revolutionary activity of the workers in the present epoch nothing less can 
avail &#8220;us&#8221; than this &#8220;world-revolutionary action of the working class&#8221;, to be 
carried out directly and as a whole, and the organizational and ideational 
preparedness directed immediately to this goal (Theses 2,3,4,6). It is only this 
direct &#8220;world revolution&#8221;, he says, which at all deserves the name of a 
&#8220;working-class revolution&#8221;. When &#8220;anything less is attempted&#8221; - as already shown 
by the movement in the period following the late war and which <i>in victory and 
defeat failed as revolution </i>&#8211; &#8220;the class, as an army of millions, simply 
ceases to function in its history-making role&#8221;. Every revolution which either at 
its very beginning or in its further course is limited to a single country is 
said to contain unavoidably &#8220;the element of counter-revolution&#8221;, and this holds 
in particular of the &#8220;Russian&#8221; revolution of 1917. (Beside this one, the author 
of the Theses is aware of still others, a whole &#8220;series&#8221; of national political 
revolutions flowing from the post-war crisis and for the &#8220;victory&#8221; of which the 
preceding &#8220;sluggishness which had settled over the labor movement&#8221; had formed 
the precondition. What other victorious national revolutions are meant by this 
does not become clear). The attempt of Trotskism to set in place of the real 
world revolution its mere &#8220;ideological camouflage&#8221; by interpreting the series of 
national revolutions of the present period as the &#8216;permanent revolution&#8217; is 
expressly waved aside. And all those &#8220;proletarian-revolutionary under-currents&#8221; 
which in the previous period &#8220;transcended&#8221; the limited character of the then 
labor movement, &#8220;tied up with social-reformist and (onIy) 
political-revolutionary tasks&#8221;, are denoted without exception as mere &#8220;utopian&#8221; 
tendencies which leave unchanged the actually intra-capitalist wage-worker 
movements of that time, but were able to furnish them &#8220;merely a further 
ideological supplement&#8221;. So that the &#8220;workers&#8217; world revolution&#8221; proclaimed in 
these Theses remains a pure dream of the future (<i>Zukunftmusik</i>) for which 
in the past and present, apart from a few <i>attempts</i> undertaken at the end 
of the &#8220;first world war&#8221; but in the meanwhile completely exhausted and &#8216;decayed&#8217; 
(among them particularly the &#8216;heroic&#8217; attempt of the Russian October 
revolutionists to push forward their Russian revolution as the incipient world 
revolution), in the actual movement and development of the working class there 
is still no real beginning. Though in Thesis 2, after the constatation of the 
used-up character of all the &#8220;energies of revolution assembled in the 
revolutionary cycle of 1850-1917&#8221;, we at first still have a reference to 
certain, though &#8216;weak&#8217; new beginnings, still at the end of the Theses it is 
expressly stated that &#8220;the revolutionary actions of the working class must, on 
the whole, begin all over again from the beginning&#8221;. This state of affairs is, 
to be sure, on the one hand denoted as a &#8216;difficulty&#8217; (the only &#8220;genuine 
difficulty of the new situation&#8221;), but on the other hand also celebrated as the 
final &#8220;severing of the umbilical cord between bourgeois and proletarian 
revolution&#8221; and hence as a &#8220;gratifying state of affairs for the worker 
revolutionists&#8221;. The workers - we might briefly express the sense of this 
closing part of the Theses - at that zero point of their revolutionary action at 
which they have now finally arrived, have &#8220;at least won the negative freedom for 
their own enormous ends&#8221;.</p>

<p>Against this assertion there is first to be objected that as a matter of fact 
it is not true. When the Theses state, among other things, that now none of 
their old dilapidated and bankrupt leaders can no longer presume to whisper to 
the workers what their &#8220;historical mission&#8221; is, the sad reality shows rather the 
contrary. They can so presume, they can do it and they do actually do it, and 
the workers also listen to them, not only in England and other extra-German 
countries, but also in Germany, and again today more than in the first period 
after the unresisting capitulation of both the old social-democratic-communist 
party leaderships before the Hitlerian &#8220;national and socialist revolution&#8221;. 
Secondly, however, this &#8220;negative freedom&#8221; of the workers from all the 
influences through which they have hitherto been &#8220;diverted&#8221; from their own <i>ex 
hypothesi</i>
&#8220;enormous&#8221; (i.e. still completely <i>undefined and unformed</i>) ends - such 
freedom would be at the same time their &#8220;freedom&#8221; from their whole previous 
history, inclusive of all the fighting experiences won in this history, and the 
reversion of the working class out of that determinateness which it has won in 
its previous development to the initial state (given through their mere economic 
existence as a suppressed and exploited class within capitalist society) of the 
&#8220;class in itself&#8221;. It is impossible to conceive how it could pass over all at 
once and without a new &#8220;drawing back before the undefined enormousness of its 
own tasks&#8221; out of this condition of an absolute freedom, i.e. of an absolute 
nothingness, through the mere &#8220;approach of the second world war&#8221; and the &#8220;second 
world-revolutionary situation&#8221; to which it gives rise, to that highest reality 
and determinateness of a direct and total truly proletarian, truly 
class-befitting, truly world-embracing genuine workers&#8217; revolution for which 
alone, in the view of the author of these Theses, the throwing in of the 
proletarian forces, after the bitter experiences of the past, is still at all 
worthwhile and without the full attainment of which any new militant activity of 
the workers must lead merely to another and still worse decline into 
sluggishness. As a matter of fact, it is not the rousing call to action (that is 
to say, to the directly world-revolutionary action of the workers in connection 
with the next world-war crisis &#8220;around 1940&#8221;) but the fearful <i>punishment</i> 
set on the failure to follow this last warning - it is this punishment which 
forms the real content of the prospects expressed in these Theses. The author 
says in effect: there is offered to the workers once more - at a period now 
lying only a few years in the future - that incomparable opportunity of which 
they failed to make full use at the end of the &#8220;first world war&#8221;. &quot;In the second 
world war it will become evident that there is only one convincing program: the 
world order of labor, and that the emancipation of the workers is the 
precondition for its actualization. <i>If the workers then fail</i>, however, to 
win their freedom, then the new means of mastery which the ruling class today 
has constructed on a national scale will be extended by it internationally on 
ruins and blood and the productive forces subjected to a still sharper 
discipline. That will be the essence of the new &#8220;world-revolutionary struggles&#8221;. 
Here in the very formulation it remains undecided whether, after all, these new 
&#8220;world-revolutionary struggles&#8221; of the near future as well will not in their 
actual result lead rather to the &#8220;international extension&#8221; of the &#8220;new (fascist) 
means of mastery&#8221; than to the &#8220;emancipation of the workers&#8221; and rather to a 
&#8220;still sharper (fascist) discipline&#8221; than to the &#8220;free unfoldment of the 
productive forces&#8221;.</p>

<p>At this place we come up against a point from which it becomes imperative to 
attack not only the subjectively practical content of these Theses, but at the 
same time their <i>theoretically objective</i>
content; that is, the theoretical analysis which they give of the historical 
development, and of the objective developmental tendencies coming to light 
therein. The question arises whether there is not concealed even in the 
objective combination of world crisis, war and revolution, as it is given in 
these Theses twice (once <i>retrospectively</i>
for the first world-war crisis 1913-1919, the other time <i>prospectively</i>
for the impending new world-war crisis of a near future), some capitulation or 
other before the violent attack of the capitalist-fascist opponent, an attack 
which at the present moment is obviously felt as over-powerful. With such 
capitulations, defeatist states of mind and prison ideologies the entire 
European labor movement is teeming today, and even the revolutionary tendency 
within the labor movement shows some of the same affliction.</p>

<p>If from this critical point of view one examines the objective theoretical 
content of the present Theses, at first everything appears here in the best, 
revolutionary order. It is a revolutionary attack on the enemy position, and no 
capitulation, when the &#8220;immemorial (?) alternation of war and peace&#8221; - which <i>
apparently</i> (not, as stated in the Theses with a too far-going adaptation to 
the opponent&#8217;s ideas, &#8220;in itself&#8221; ) &#8220;goes on in other connections&#8221;- is 
recognized as &#8220;involved in the industrial cycle&#8221; and modern &#8220;industrial warfare&#8221; 
is recognized as a special form of capitalist crisis. To be sure, this new and 
revolutionary insight is presupposed in the Theses as a directly obvious state 
of affairs rather than supported and proved, and the <i>characterization of war 
as a form of capitalist crisis which in its very course becomes intensified once 
more to crisis </i>still contains in this unmediated form a metaphorical and 
mystifying character. The equating of war to crisis loses, however, even this 
final remnant of apparent mystification when one adds the plain and in no sense 
metaphorical observation that the special mode of production of modern war - a 
mode of production which does not produce products and means of production, but 
destruction and means of destruction - represents nothing more than a normal 
manifestation of capitalist production. The capitalist mode of production has 
constantly contained and contains in itself at all its stages of development 
both kinds of production, that of the creation and that of the destruction of 
products. Both form inseparable components of capitalist production in its 
specific social form as &#8220;commodity production&#8221;, that is, as production not 
simply of products, but of products as commodities, and this historical mode of 
production is not complete until we have both together. What comes up newly 
today is simply this, that now even certain formal distinctions which hitherto 
have ever existed between the two phenomenal forms of capitalist production (the 
so-called normal production for peace, and the other - in reality no less normal 
- production for war and in war) are being more and more eradicated through a 
process of mutual assimilation and that thereby the inner identity of these two 
equally legitimate branches of capitalist production is made manifest. In an 
epoch when a part of the &#8220;normal&#8221; production in peace-times consists in the 
conscious and &#8220;planful&#8221; mass destruction of products, means of production, 
productive forces and producers, when at the same time the relative weight of 
the so-called &#8220;war industry&#8221; even in peace exceeds by far and in rapidly 
increasing measure that of any other single branch of production, and each 
special branch of production in its turn is treated potentially even in peace 
and on the approach of war then also actually as a mere subordinate department 
of the one unified war industry, - in such conditions it appears only logical 
that <i>war</i> itself, which according to aim and mode of existence is no 
longer to be distinguished from war industry and peace industry, should finally 
no longer be distinguished from these other branches of capitalist commodity 
production, even in thought. If one has taken this step, then that paradoxical 
sentence in which war itself is regarded as a mere special form of the <i>crises</i> 
unavoidably occurring periodically in the course of capitalist production, that 
is, as a crisis which in another, .more direct and more simple manner, &#8220;performs 
the special work of any crisis, destruction of value which cannot be turned to 
account&#8221; - this sentence of the Theses thus becomes not only understandable as a 
plain, matter-of-fact observation. Rather it also becomes clear forthwith why in 
the process of war now going on even in the forms of capitalist production &#8220;the 
presupposition of crisis is set once more within the crisis&#8221;, in that the 
&#8220;over-production&#8221; occurring in every crisis occurs here also in the form of a 
&#8220;production intensified beyond its own measure&#8221; - production of materials of 
destruction and of destruction itself. This intensification of the crisis to a 
new crisis occurring in the crisis itself is in fact the unavoidable tendency 
breaking through in war and peace, a tendency which came clearly to light in the 
late World War and which by reason of the further development of the capitalist 
forms of production (in their now recognized double mode of existence as genuine 
forms of production and forms of destruction, both of which under capitalistic 
relations combine to form an indivisible whole and of which only the two 
together represent the concrete reality of capitalist commodity production) has 
kept on growing stronger and must continue to grow still stronger in the future. 
The present development of the capitalist mode of production is thus heading, in 
one and the same process, both toward the new <i>crisis</i> and the new <i>war</i>, 
and toward the <i>combining</i> of both in a new <i>world-war crisis</i>
though which, for the class of real producers uniformly suppressed and exploited 
in war and peace, the presuppositions for a <i>new world-revolutionary situation</i>
are <i>from the objective side being actually fulfilled</i>. The masterly (in 
spite of its brevity) clarification of this objectively revolutionary situation 
is tantamount to a genuine, and in its consequences for the preparation and 
carrying out of the revolutionary struggle of the workers, also practically 
important further development of our insight into proletarian revolution.</p>

<p>And it is likewise a revolutionary attack on the enemy position, and no 
capitulation, when in the Theses the line of separation sharply drawn by the old 
Marxist theory between economics and politics, Capital and State, is in tendency 
blotted out and the &#8220;State&#8221; converted from the merely &#8216;ideational&#8217; to the actual 
&#8220;<i>Total Capitalist</i>&#8221;, and the automatic subject &#8220;Capital&#8221; with the sponsor 
&#8220;State&#8221; as special organ is smelted to a &#8220;<i>unified 
total-subject Capital</i>&#8221;. <i>The struggle 
against the capitalist state</i> has today, as a matter of fact, become in a 
quite different, more direct manner a component of the revolutionary proletarian 
class struggle against capitalist mastery than it was in the earlier period when 
the socialist labor movement actually (as admirably represented in the Theses) 
continually moved about within the (on both sides unsatisfying) contradiction of 
social reform and (only) political revolution and consequently the workers were 
unable on either field to arrive at the full concrete reality of their 
social-revolutionary struggle. It is also a revolutionary criticism which 
strikes at the heart not only of the present-day enemy, but also of the earlier 
and present-day false friends of the labor movement, when it is stated in the 
Theses that through the seizure of power by the Hitlerian National Socialism 
&#8220;the political revolution and the only possible social reform against the 
workers has won&#8221; simultaneously and hence at the same time the (in result) 
counter-revolutionary character of both these ostensibly progressive goals of 
the now surpassed forms of the labor movement has become manifest.</p>

<p>By the side of these real revolutionary intensifications of the proletarian 
attack on all the old and new forms of incorporation of the capitalist state and 
economic power there is, however, in these Theses also a series of formulations 
through which the one struggle which lies open to the workers in Germany, the 
struggle against what there today is the only incorporation of the capitalist 
class rule, is rendered vague and ambiguous. It is a dangerous tendency, in its 
consequence for the revolutionary unfoldment of the proletarian force of attack 
in the present historical period of development, when in these Theses the 
lapidary statement is made that through the new monopolistic forms of State and 
Capital the task of attaining &#8220;at least the highest measure (!) of unfoldment 
(!) of the transcending (?) productive forces in the given framework&#8221; is in the 
present being fulfilled. Let us recall in this connection also the preceding 
thesis in which the present world economic crisis was proclaimed as a thing of 
the past, now overcome, and the transition into the depression with the prospect 
of a &#8220;breathing spell&#8221; soon setting in and coming to a close in &#8220;the next world 
crisis&#8221; was announced. Let us recall, further, the peculiar form with which, 
later on in these Theses, there was denoted as another, and in reality perhaps 
more probable prospect for the international further development of the present 
world condition, by the side of the <i>complete unfoldment</i> through the 
proletarian revolution of the productive forces tied up in the inadequate 
&#8220;national&#8221; framework, also the merely &#8220;<i>still sharper discipline</i>&#8221; of these 
productive forces through the extension of fascist mastery on an international 
scale as well. It is seen that these three formulations taken together &#8211; the <i>
crisis</i>, already belonging to the past, the solution of those tasks whose 
continuing solution according to the Marxist doctrine forms the real material 
content of the whole world-historical development, but at the present time being 
accomplished by victorious fascism on a <i>national</i>
scale, and in future perhaps to be accomplished by it still further on an
<i>international</i>
scale - these three formulations result in a way of future historical 
development on which, between world crisis, world war and world revolution a 
quite different, exactly opposite form of union may be brought about than the 
one which the author of these Theses has in his subjective consciousness and 
would like to proclaim as a fighting slogan for the revolutionary proletariat. 
In the place of the bursting of the capitalistic fetters and of the unfettered 
free development of the productive forces, there comes first in the national and 
thereafter possibly also in the international framework their maximal unfoldment 
(violently &#8216;attained&#8217; by victorious fascism without the bursting of their 
present capitalist form) in the way of a still further sharpened &#8220;discipline&#8221;. 
First attacking nationally, and then extending the captured positions on an 
international scale, Fascism accomplishes its &#8220;historical task&#8221;, in that it 
shows to capitalist society, menaced on the one hand by the social revolution, 
and on the other by its own dissolution, an heroic way out and forces upon it 
the choice of this heroic way. With this perspective, however, the social 
revolution of the proletariat is converted from a general necessity of the 
development of human society into the private affair of an isolated class or 
even only of an interested band of Jewish or other racially foreign agitators.</p>

<p>The ambiguity brought into the Theses through this formulation regarding the 
presently given <i>economic</i>
possibilities of social development is still further strengthened by way of an 
equally ambiguous
<i>political</i> formula occurring in the same 
connection: &#8220;<i>The state-subject capital seizes the monopoly on class struggle</i>&quot;. 
That may mean, and does in fact mean according to its first and most obvious 
sense, that the fascist State suppresses the whole previous class struggle of 
the wage-workers against capital. &#8220;The breaking up of all class organs of the 
workers is its first accomplishment&#8221;. To the quite correct observation contained 
in this first sentence there would only remain to be added, from the standpoint 
of a clear Marxist conception based on the fact of the class struggle, a further 
statement throwing light on the point as to what change is experienced, as a 
result of this &#8220;monopolization&#8221; through the fascist State, by the other side of 
the class struggle hitherto carried on under capitalist society, <i>the class 
struggle of capital against the wage-workers</i>. This statement would have to 
demonstrate say that the fascist State - bound up in the closest manner with 
large capital and, though formally set over the individual capitalist, yet in 
its general material existence unconditionally dependent on capital - continues 
to carry on, in this other, expanded and sharpened form, &#8220;on behalf of the 
State&#8221;, that &#8216;monopolized&#8217; class struggle against the workers. Finally, from a 
truly dialectical, i.e. practically materialistic and revolutionary Marxist 
conception, there would have to be added that the fascist state, by reason of 
this continuing, expanding and sharpening of the class struggle which it has 
&#8220;monopolized&#8221;, is at the same time on its own part exposed to the continued, 
expanded and sharpened <i>class struggle of the workers</i>. Instead of this 
class-befitting, dialectical and revolutionary conception, the formula of the 
&#8220;monopolization of the class struggle by the fascist State&#8221; is based on a 
different conception, as the very next following sentences prove. The author of 
the Theses entertains the idea that in this &#8220;monopolization of the class 
struggle&#8221; in its two antagonistic forms as a struggle of wage-labor against 
capital and of capital against wage labor, the fascist State is, as a matter of 
fact, at least temporarily and on a national scale being <i>successful</i>: &#8220;A 
ruthless social-pacification action with the aim of the &#8216;organic&#8217; fitting of 
that part of capital represented by wage labor into the new State is introduced. 
At the same time, a far-flung reorganization of the capitalist class is 
undertaken, in order to adapt it to the special task of political economy in the 
present period &#8230;. In the place of private-economy profitability there arises 
national-economy profitability. The state-subject capital, organizes the 
domestic market, regulates (a national general cartel) the prices &#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>All these tasks then according to the statements here quoted from the Theses, 
are fundamentally being accomplished by the fascist State in exactly the one 
manner in which they could be accomplished by a revolutionary workers&#8217; state 
proceeding from a genuine workers&#8217; revolution, insofar as this State should 
remain limited to the national framework or should later on become so limited. 
It is expressly declared that between such different forms and degrees of the 
fusion of State and Capital as on the one hand, &#8220;bolshevist state capitalism&#8221;, 
and, on the other, the fascist &#8220;systematic intervention&#8221; and the 
national-socialist &#8220;economy steering&#8221; <i>there is no difference of a fundamental 
nature</i>. In reality, with this failure to make distinction between 
historically oppositely directed developments, and with the whole supporting 
undialectical appraisal of the economic and political possibilities of a fascist 
or national-socialist State remaining fundamentally in the capitalist framework, 
the historical accomplishment and capacity of accomplishment, hence also the 
force of attack and defense of the at present triumphant 
fascist-national-socialist counter-revolution is monstrously and, for the 
development of the proletarian counter-movement, damagingly overrated. In order 
to make clear the measure of this over-rating, we may recall that such a 
monopoly on the class struggle as, according to these Theses, the Hitlerian 
National Socialism and the Mussolinian Fascism have today &#8216;seized&#8217; was not laid 
claim to even by the revolutionary dictator Lenin for his revolutionary &#8220;workers 
and peasants&#8217; State&#8221; in the &#8220;war communist&#8221; development of the year 1920. In the 
disputes waged at that time, prior to the transition to &#8220;NEP&#8221;, regarding the 
future character of the Soviet-Russian trade unions, the most that Lenin had 
ventured to suggest was in substance that the trade unions should restrict 
themselves in future to the ordinary class struggle for the purpose of 
safeguarding the workers&#8217; direct interests within the framework of the soviet 
economic and state system and should henceforth renounce the revolutionary 
intensification of this struggle, now that the further extension of the 
revolution had become the immediate task of the soviet State. In the later 
development of Russian state socialism and state capitalism, in the forms of NEP 
and Neo-Nep, even this right, at first granted by Lenin, to the ordinary class 
struggle for the workers&#8217; immediate interests was, as we know, again denied to 
the trade unions. The present-day Stalinist state capitalism has, that is, just 
as did the dictatorial state of Hitler and Mussolini, completely conferred upon 
itself this &#8220;monopoly of the class struggle&#8221;. But neither in the one case nor in 
the other (and in the latter case, if only because of the incomparably weaker 
position of these capitalistic counter-revolutionary &#8220;dictatorships&#8221; as against 
the claim to profit on the part of private capital - a claim which was never 
fundamentally or actually broken - much less than in the Lenin-Stalinist 
dictatorship) has this ideological &#8220;monopolization&#8221; of the class struggle in the 
hands of the State even for a time and within the national framework been 
actually realized. Just as according to the international principle of 
revolutionary Marxism, proletarian socialism cannot be constructed &#8220;in one 
country&#8221; either wholly or in part, either permanently or for a time, so also 
according to the same principle the class struggle in its two antagonistic 
manifestations cannot be done away with &#8220;in one country&#8221; or converted into a 
simple component of the economic and political ruling functions exercised - 
without contradiction within the national boundaries - by the State.</p>

<p>To the two tasks of the fascist economic and state power which in these 
Theses are recognized as capable of accomplishment within the national 
framework, the author himself sets a limit. In the single place where he thinks 
&#8220;dialectically&#8221;, i.e. truly materialistically and practically revolutionarily, 
he declares that &#8220;the state-subject Capital&#8221;, in that as a general cartel it 
regulates the prices, &#8220;<i>thereby at the same time (!) sharpens the 
international competition</i>&#8221;. &#8220;The international trade policy has become the 
vital question of States&#8221; (&#8216;Twilight of Autarchy&#8217;). The new monopolistic forms 
have therefore not only failed to hold up the cyclical course of world economy; 
they fail also to withdraw their own sphere of action from the &#8216;natural law&#8217; of 
capitalism.</p>

<p>But even apart from the fact that the - here directly geographical - limit 
set for the accomplishment of the economic and political tasks of the present 
world development by means of Fascism is later, after all, regarded as not 
entirely insuperable, but rather that the possibility of its being crossed by a 
Fascism extending internationally its new means of mastery is expressly 
admitted, this final introduction of the dialectical manner of looking at 
things, through which a positive solution of the tasks set by the present 
development of the productive forces and productive relations is in the fascist 
framework nationally and internationally precluded, comes much too late. Just as 
dialectically as the <i>regulating of the domestic market</i> through the 
fascist state-subject Capital actualizes itself on an <i>international</i> scale 
as a sharpened competition which very quickly recoils upon the domestic market 
as well, so the alleged &#8216;solution&#8217; of the economic and political tasks of 
Fascism becomes involved in advance, within the production process itself on the 
purely national scale, and from the first step onward, in ever new and sharper 
contradictions. At this place it would have been in order to take up a truly 
Marxist, materialistically practical analysis of the present and future 
combinations of world crisis, world war and world revolution, and to proclaim 
the present struggle of the proletariat in each country and on an international 
scale against the <i>here and now</i> present form of capitalist mastery, and 
all its expressions, as the single genuine content of the proletarian &#8220;world 
revolution.&#8221;</p>
