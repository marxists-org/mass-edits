<p>In a previous issue<a href="#01">[1]</a> we have endeavored to
refute one of the main
fallacies that conceal from the international-working class the
particular importance of that new phase of the Spanish revolution which
was inaugurated by the events of July 19, 1936. In spite of the rapidly
increasing amount of literature on Spain today there is not available
up to now any full report of what from our point of view we would call
the real contents of the present struggles in revolutionary Spain. Of
course, one would not expect such information on the really interesting
facts from those progressively-minded people who even today go on to
interpret the intensified class struggles, wars, and civil&nbsp;wars of
contemporary history as so many expressions of an ideological struggle
between a fascist and a democratic ''principle". Yet the actual content
of that so-called spiritual struggle is not revealed any better by
those apparently objective and realistic historians who dismiss the
civil war aspects of the present developments in Spain (not to speak of
the less conspicuous conflicts between the various groups of the
loyalist popular front) as a very subordinate phase of that battle
between various imperialistic groups that according to them constitutes
the essence of all present-day political developments on a worldwide
scale. As against both the "idealistic" and the "realistic"
superficiality of the bourgeois historians, the proletarian reader is
referred once more to the illuminating report of the first seven months
of so-called collectivization in revolutionary Spain published by the
Spanish workers themselves for the express purpose to break the
conspiracy of silence and distortion by which of all the aspects of the
recent events in Spain just this one truly revolutionary aspect has
been almost entirely annihilated.<a href="#02">[2]</a></p>
<p>For the first time since the postwar revolutionary period led to
various experiments in socialization in Soviet Russia, Hungary, and
Germany the struggle of the Spanish workers against capitalism as
described here shows us a new type of transition from capitalist to
communal methods of production that has been achieved, though
incompletely, in an imposing variety of forms. The significance of this
revolutionary experience is not impaired even though all of these
advances toward a new, free, communal economy were in the meantime
nullified and destroyed. The revolutionary achievements of the workers
were frustrated either from without by the advancing
counter-revolution, or from the inside by their apparent allies within
the antifascist front. The workers were forced into abandoning the
fruits of their struggle either by open suppression or, more often,
under pretext of the "higher necessity" of disciplined warfare. To a
large extent the revolutionary achievements of the first hour were even
sacrificed voluntarily by their very initiators in a vain attempt to
further thereby the main aim of the common struggle against fascism.</p>
<p>Even so, the endeavors of the Spanish workers on the social and
economic front have not been entirely in vain. The violent liquidation
of the Paris Commune of 1871 and, an epoch later, of the Hungarian and
Bavarian Soviet revolutions, as well as the slower, less obvious
self-liquidation of the first revolutionary content of Russian Soviet
socialism have not annihilated the significance of any of those great
attempts of the past to establish and test a new type of state for the
transition to socialism. Similarly the ultimate destruction of the here
described collectivization measures by friend and foe in from the
historical importance of the present-day Spain detracts nothing &#65279;new,
free type of communal production attempted here for the first time on a
larger scale. The study of this movement, its conceptions and methods,
its successes and failures, and the consequent recognition of its
strength and weakness is therefore of lasting importance to that class
conscious and revolutionary section of the international proletariat to
whom the book is expressly addressed and to whom it gives a careful
account of this effort at self-emancipation begun by the Spanish
working class. Moreover, this careful account of the methods and
results of collectivization in the industrially most advanced province
of Spain, authorized by the leading labor organizations of Catalonia
(the syndicalist C. N. T. and the anarchist F. A. I.), is of general
theoretical importance as a historical source book of the first rank.
The editors endeavor, as far as possible to let "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">the Spanish
revolutionists speak for themselves</span>." Besides a number of short
sketches necessary to complete the picture, the collection offered by
them contains original documents, decrees of expropriation, reports of
the syndicates (unions), resolutions, statutes, etc., and reports,
interviews and accounts on the various industries and localities by the
functionaries of the revolutionary movement. This character of a pure
source book is followed consistently in style and material and thus a
work has resulted which is intensely human while meeting the most rigid
requirements of scientific objectivity. These simple reports and
narratives of the common folk in city and village, never dry or
boresome, in their pathos unblurred by pretentious retouching reproduce
the voice of the Spanish revolution, the action of the proletariat, as
it is and together with the documentary material lend authenticity and
veracity to the work. It is almost superfluous for the authors to
declare at the end that "in this book will be found neither praise nor
slander, neither exaggerations nor protestations." "We have simply
allowed the Spanish worker to tell the whole world what he has done to
maintain and defend his freedom and welfare."</p>
<p>Of the four parts of the book the first deals with the general
character of the "new collective economy" and, in an annexed short
review of "Catalonian Economy", explains the commanding position of
Barcelona in the Spanish economy as a whole and the ensuing decisive
role of the industrial workers of Catalonia in the social struggles of
the Spanish working class. In the second part the methods and results
of collective labor in the different branches of industry are
presented. The third and fourth parts give a description, by
geographical districts, cities and villages, of the rise and operation
of a more or less completed communal economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In contrast to various other ''socialization decrees" of
recent European history the collectivization decree of the Catalonian
Economic Council of October 10, 1936, reprinted in full on pages 32-42,
is but the legalization of changes in industry and transport that had
already been accomplished in fact. "It contains no special directions
that transcend the limits already set by the spontaneous movement of
the workers." There were no lengthy investigations on the "tasks and
limits of collectivizations," no arbitrarily selected body of learned
experts, lacking all real authority such as the notorious "Permanent
Special Commission" of the French February revolution of 1848, or its
faithful copy, the German "Socialization Commission" of 1918-19. The
syndicalist and anarchist labor movement of Spain, well prepared for
this task by many years of incessant discussion carried into the
remotest corners of the country, were better informed and possessed a
much more realistic conception of the necessary steps to achieve their
economic aims than had been shown, in similar situations, by the
so-called "Marxist" labor movement in other parts of Europe. It is true
that in this first heroic phase the Spanish movement to a certain
extent, neglected the political and juridical safeguarding of the new
economic and social conditions it had achieved. Even this initial
mistake, which could be only partially remedied later, was difficult to
avoid under the conditions. Except for the "Committees of Anti-Fascist
Militias" formed by representatives of the libertarian labor movement
themselves there was at that early time neither an executive authority
nor a parliament.<a href="#03">[3]</a> Nor were there any large
capitalist proprietors to
be expropriated. A considerable portion of the largest enterprises were
owned by foreign capital. Its representatives, like the native large
capitalists, had been more or less open supporters of the rebelling
generals. Both groups fled as soon as the Franco rebellion in Barcelona
had failed unless they had anticipated that possibility and, like Juan
March and Francois Cambo, had shrewdly abandoned the country they
consecrated to civil war. The offensive against capital inaugurated by
the Catalonian workers immediately after the heroic suppression of the
Franco revolt resembled a war against an invisible enemy. The directors
of the great railroads, of the urban transportation companies, of the
shipping firms in the harbor of Barcelona, the owners of the textile
factories in Tarrasa and Sabadell had disappeared and it was
exceptional when during the seizure of the street car system of
Barcelona the workers found in the administration buildings of the big
monopolistic concerns a lonely, trembling creature whose life and
liberty they could spare by a magnanimous impulse.</p>
<p>Thus the Catalonian proletariat established itself at will in the
capitalist plants and offices that had been deserted by their erstwhile
masters. The collectivized enterprises after seizure by the workers
operated in similar fashion as "the stock companies of capitalist
economy." The general meetings of the workers proceeded to elect
councils in which all activities of the plants are
represented&mdash;production, administration, technical service, etc.
Permanent connection with the rest of industry was maintained by the
representatives of the trade union central bodies, who also
participated in the sessions of the councils. The business management
itself was left to a director selected by the workers of each shop, in
the more important enterprises subject to the consent of the general
council of the respective industry; there is no reason why he should
not be the former owner, manager or director, of the socialized
enterprise.</p>
<p>However, this external similarity by no means signifies that
collectivization did not essentially change the system of production of
the industrial and commercial enterprises. It merely demonstrates the
relative ease with which under equally fortunate circumstances as had
offered themselves here &mdash; deep and far reaching changes in
production management and wage payment can be accomplished without
great formal and organizational transformations. Once the resistance of
the former economic and political rulers was completely eliminated for
a time, the armed workers could proceed directly from their military
task to the positive one of continuing and transforming production for
which they had prepared themselves in what had seemed to many observers
to be boundless and "utopian" dreams in the preceding period.</p>
<p>Even for that most intricate problem of socialism, the
collectivization of agriculture, these workers had prepared a
completely realistic program unmarred by haste, exaggeration or
psychological blunders. The resolution on the collectivization of the
land which had been passed by the congress of the C. N. T. in Madrid in
June, 1931, and which since, through all the vicissitudes of an
advancing and retreating revolutionary movement, had been spread and
carefully explained throughout the land by anarchist and syndicalist
propagandists, gave now practical guidance for action in July and
August, 1936 to the agricultural laborers and small tenant farmers left
entirely to their own initiative, unhampered by any external authority
or tutelage. The concrete forms in which this task was solved by the
agricultural producers themselves is illustrated by a resolution of the
full meeting of the Catalonian agricultural workers and by the
regulations and organization plans subsequently adopted by various
districts and communes in the agricultural year 1936-37.</p>
<p>Only the main points of the detailed and exact manner of presenting-
the collectivization in the most important single industries &mdash;
transport, textile, food and others &mdash; that take up the second
part of the book can be discussed here. These chapters show not only
the new social organization of the industries, but mark distinctly the
beginnings of the great successes resulting from the economic and
social initiative of the libertarian labor movement for the workers
themselves and even more so in maintaining and expanding production. We
read of the abolition of inhuman working conditions, of wage increases
and reduction in hours, of various new forms of equalizing wages
between various types of workers, skilled and unskilled, male and
female, adults and juveniles, of "salaire unique" and "salaire
familial." We see how the question of raising and improving production
in every industry assumes increasing importance from week to week. We
read of entirely new industries such as the optical industry, called
into being by the revolution itself. We hear of the process by which
some branches of industries lacking unobtainable foreign raw materials,
or not necessary for the immediate needs of the population were now
quickly adapted to procuring the more pressing war materials. We are
told the pathetic story of those poorest strata of the working class
who voluntarily sacrificed their at last improved conditions in order
to assist in war production and to aid the war victims and refugees
from Franco-occupied territory.</p>
<p>However, these negative virtues of sacrifice and self denial under
which the great achievements of the revolutionary Spanish workers in
the last two years has too often been submerged by their more or less
sympathetic foreign observers, do not claim our main interest in this
matter. Our main interest in this first period of Spanish
collectivization is in the important role played by the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">particular type
of trade unions</span> most characteristically represented by the
workers of
Catalonia and Valencia that until recently was attacked and despised by
the prosperous trade unions of England and the powerful Marxist
organizations of middle and eastern Europe as a Utopian form doomed to
failure in any serious situation. These syndicalist formations,
anti-party and anti-centralistic, were entirely based on the free
action of the working masses. Their whole business, routine as well as
emergency activities, had been managed from the outset not by
professional officialdom, but by the elite of the workers in the
respective industries. That same conscious elite represented by
revolutionary acting committees, created by the fighting workers within
and without the unions to meet the various problems as they arose,
furnished the initiative, endurance, example, and activity for the
basic achievements of the new revolutionary period. This historic
lesson of Spanish collectivization is of permanent importance for the
organizational and tactical developement of the revolutionary movement.</p>
<p>The energy of the anti-State attitude of the revolutionary Spanish
proletariat, unhampered by self created organizational or ideological
obstacles explains all their surprising successes in the face of
overwhelming difficulties. It explains the fact, unprecedented by any
previous European experience, that revolutionary collectivization in
Spain from the outset and as a matter of course was extended to the
<span style="font-style: italic;">State and municipal enterprises</span>
as well as to private capitalist
concerns. In this connection the account of the collectivization of the
State Petroleum Monopoly and of the public services (light, power, and
water works) generally is of the greatest interest. Even the otherwise
somewhat exuberant description of the rapid "100% collectivization of
the barber shops" and of the equally successful "social regulation of
street-trade" in Barcelona, eloquently testify to the peculiar creative
power of the revolution even in a sphere whose very existence conflicts
with it though they add very little to the real solution of such
difficult border problems of the proletarian revolution as &#65279;those
dealing with handicraft and commerce. The real contributions of the
Spanish revolution to these questions are only indirectly touched in
connection with the already mentioned problem of agricultural
production and in the discussion (contained in parts 4 and 5) of the
various forms in which collectivization has been achieved on a local
scale by measures more or less affecting the entire production and mode
of existence of the smaller cities and country districts.</p>
<p>The no longer theoretical but purely descriptive character of these
last two parts prevents rendition of even a small fraction of its rich
contents in this short review. Each of these fourteen small narratives,
apparently sketch-like, but touching all essential problems of society,
reports the more or less typical yet peculiar features of the new life
under the varying local conditions based on the general development of
the country. The description starts with the advanced industrial
conditions in the textile center, Tarrasa, near the capital, with its
40,000 inhabitants of whom 14,000 were workers, 11,000 of whom were
organized in the syndicalist C.N.T., while the rest were in the
social-democratic U.G.T. From there through various intermediate stages
it moves down to the poorest, most primitive, small and smallest
villages of Catalonia, Aragon and LaMancha, located far from all
industrial and urban culture, yet deeply affected by the new life. Here
the publishers remark: "And we notice continually that great and real
revolutionary progress was made in the small, thinly populated cities
and villages, a more important progress undoubtedly than in the cities
with the greater populations." This praise of simplicity and poverty is
in strange contrast to the materialistic ideas of the Marxist movement
but has long been characteristic of this other form of labor movement
which in the trenches of the Spanish civil war and in the equally
heroic endurance of the suffering populations of Madrid, Barcelona, and
Valencia carried on the struggle of the working class temporarily
defeated everywhere in the rest of Europe. The sentiment here described
reaches its climax in the concluding sketch about a little country town
situated in a thinly populated province of La Manche. There the workers
were at all times utterly deprived of modern material and cultural
comfort. Nevertheless, they had all been organized in their syndicates
since 1920 and had now been among the first to completely adopt the new
life of libertarian communism. Referring to this experience, the book
ends in the pathetic statement: "Membrilla is perhaps the poorest city
in Spain, but it is the justest."</p>
