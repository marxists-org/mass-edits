<h3>I</h3>

<p>More than any preceding period of recent history, and on a
much vaster scale, our period is a time not of revolution but of
counter revolution. This is true whether we define this comparatively
new term as a conscious counter-action against a preceding
revolutionary process or whether we describe it as do some Italians and
their ideological forerunners in pre-war France, as an essentially
"preventive revolution." It is counter-action of the united capitalist
class against all that remains today of the results of that first great
insurrection of the proletarian forces of war-torn Europe which
culminated in the Russian October of 1917. At the same time it embodies
a series of "preventive" measures of the ruling minority against such
new revolutionary dangers as have been most conspicuously revealed by
recent events in France and Spain and which are actually contained in
the whole European situation, be it in "red" Soviet Russia or fascist
Italy, Nazi Germany, or any of the old "democratic" countries.</p>

<p>The heightened consciousness of the counter revolutionary
drive, in contrast to the merely conservative and reactionary
tendencies, desires more than the curtailment of the workers'
resistance to increasing suppression and pauperization. The common goal
of such figureheads of the present-day European politics as Hitler,
Mussolini, Daladier, and Chamberlain is the creation of conditions
which will make impossible any independent movement of the European
working class for a long time to come.</p>

<p>To attain this goal the leading statesmen in the so-called
democratic countries of Europe are prepared to break every hallowed
tradition and to abandon every cherished "idea" of the past. To this
objective they will sacrifice not only, as they always have done, the
freedom and welfare of their peoples, but even part of the privileges
hitherto enjoyed by their own class. They are even willing to surrender
some of the material and ideal advantages of their traditional
positions, including personal dignity, in order to participate as minor
partners in the benefits expected from the increased exploitation
forced upon the workers by the new counterrevolutionary forms of
complete political, social, and cultural enslavement.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The foregoing description deals with the general aspects of
the present-day European counterrevolution as they have developed after
the crushing defeat of every attempt to extend the Revolution of 1917
and thus to furnish the new proletarian society in Russia with a
suitable parallel environment in other European and extra-European
countries. All but the most wilfully blinded partisans of the Communist
party recognize the fact that for a considerable time even the new
workers' state emerging from the first proletarian victory in Soviet
Russia has ceased to possess an unequivocally revolutionary character.
By a historical process which I shall tentatively describe as a gradual
"degeneration," the Russian state has abandoned more and more its
original revolutionary and proletarian features. Through the
comprehensiveness of its anti-democratic and totalitarian development
it has often anticipated the so-called fascist characteristics of the
openly counterrevolutionary states of Europe and Asia. Even today the
punishments meted out in Russia for the smallest deviations from the
prescribed patterns of conduct and opinion exceed in violence the
measures applied against nonconformity either in fascist Italy or in
Nazi Germany. On the international scene the new Russian commonwealth
has increasingly participated in the game of imperialistic politics, in
military alliances with certain groups of bourgeois states against
other groups of bourgeois states, and contributed its full share to
what in the highly deceptive language of modern bourgeois diplomacy is
called a furtherance of "peace," "collective security," and
"non-intervention." Thus the leading bureaucracy of the so-called
workers' state has become irretrievably enmeshed in the
counterrevolutionary as peers of present-day European politics.</p>

<p>Under the widely changed conditions of the class struggle
today what Lenin wrote in the opening paragraphs of his pamphlet on the
"State and Revolution" in August, 1917, concerning the increased
importance of the question of the state both in theory and from the
point of view of practical politics takes on renewed importance. The
imperialist war and its aftermath have greatly accelerated and
intensified both the transformation of monopoly capitalism into
state-monopoly capitalism and the monstrous oppression of the laboring
masses by the state which becomes increasingly intertwined with the
all-powerful capitalist combines. The apparently transitory and
war-conditioned effects of this post-war development have become
enduring and indeed normal features of present-day capitalism as a
whole. There is no doubt today of the permanent nature of the process
described by Lenin twenty years ago by which "the foremost countries
are being converted into military convict labor prisons for the
workers."</p>

<p>Yet under the conditions of an existing counterrevolution it
is by no means sufficient at the present time merely to repeat those
powerful statements of which Lenin in 1917 elaborated the revolutionary
Marxian theory of the state and the relation of the proletarian
revolution to the state. It is strange that the Trotskyites should
refer today to "Lenin's magnificent formulation" as a work written on
the eve of October "in order to explain to the masses not merely of
Russia but of the world and for the future (as a guide if the
Bolsheviks that time fall in achieving their aims) the meaning of
workers' democracy." This was never the aim of that translator into
action of the traditional Marxian theory. When the outbreak of the
political crisis "intervened" with the conclusion of his theoretical
work he cheerfully added to his pamphlet the exultant remark that "it
is more pleasant and useful to go through the 'experience of the
revolution' than to write about it."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Today the whole situation has profoundly altered. There is no
point in continuing in the unreal ideological sphere, the materialistic
and entirely practical philosophy of the revolutionary state as worked
out by Marx and restated by Lenin. We might as well philosophize with
Plato on the most perfect form of the ideal state and the extent to
which the counterrevolutionary empire of Hitler is the true earthly
fulfillment of Plato's lofty dream of the transition from debased
democracy to "the noble tyranny, from all preceding forms different,
the fourth and last disease of the state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was very well for the Russian proletariat and its Bolshevik
leaders in 1917 to "go through the experience" of the developing
revolution rather than to philosophize about it. But the Russian and
non-Russian workers today cannot confine themselves to experiencing the
steadily advancing counterrevolution without making every effort to
interpret its significance. By a careful examination of the past they
must find out both the objective and the subjective causes for the
victory of fascist state capitalism. They must closely watch its
unfolding in order to discover the old and new forms of contradiction
and antagonism appearing in that development. Finally they must find
out a practical way to resist, as a class, the further encroachments of
the counterrevolution and later to pass from an active resistance to an
even more active counteroffensive in order to overthrow both the
particular state capitalist form recently adopted and the general
principle of exploitation inherent in all old and new forms of
bourgeois society and its state power.</p>

<p>Thus, what is needed first of all is a comprehensive analysis
of the new phases which the general theory of the state assumes in face
of an existing counter-revolution. There is no doubt that this
particular task has been hitherto almost entirely neglected. This is
true in spite of the tremendous work done in the field by Marx, Engels,
and their most consistent followers up to Luxemburg, Lenin, and Trotsky
on the one hand, and by Bakunin, Proudhon, and the later spokesmen of
revolutionary anarchism and syndicalism on the other.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Of course, there would be no need for a specific investigation
into the counterrevolutionary state if the sweeping generalizations of
the anarchists, that every state at all times, including the workers'
state resulting f ram a proletarian revolution, is by its very nature
opposed to the proletarian aims, is accepted. Yet this abstract
principle did not prevent the great proletarian thinker, Proudhon, from
acclaiming the coup d'etat of December 2, 1851, as a historical victory
of the social revolution.</p>

<p>In looking back upon that first historical appearance of
quasi-fascist counterrevolution following the failure of the French
revolution of 1848, there appears a striking resemblance between the
recent utterances of Some assuredly progressive and revolutionary
writers on Hitler and Mussolini and the first reactions of practically
all progressive schools, not excluding Marx and Engels, to the coup
d'etat of Louis Napoleon in 1851. Just as on the news of the coup
d'etat the moderate bourgeois progressive ex-minister, Guizot, burst
out into the alarmed cry, "This is the perfect and final triumph of
socialism," so Proudhon philosophized about the "<span style="font-style: italic;">Revolution sociale
demontree pal' le coup d' etat du 2 decembre</span>.&rdquo;<a href="#01">[1]</a></p>

<p>Even Marx, although he was aware of the personal unfitness of
Louis Bonaparte for the quasi-revolutionary role usurped by him for a
short time, indulged in the same self-deception. Witness his
paradoxical statement that this time "revolutionary progress made
headway not through its immediate tragi-comic achievements, but on the
contrary through the creation of a powerful, united counterrevolution,
through the creation of an opponent, by fighting whom the party of
revolt first ripened into a real revolutionary party."</p>

<p>There is, indeed, only a small step from this Marxian (and for
that matter, Guizotian and Proudhonian) self-deception to the
remarkable illusions after Hitler's accession to power in 1933, which
possessed the German Communists and their Russian masters. They
welcomed the victory of an acknowledged fascism over what they had
until then described as a disguised but even more hateful form of
"social fascism," that is, the political rule of the Social Democratic
party in post-war Germany. They predicted a speedy collapse of the new
counterrevolutionary government which would be superseded by a
proletarian revolution and thus hailed their own defeat and,
incidentally, the lasting defeat of all progressive tendencies in
Germany and, indeed, all over Europe, as a "victory of communism."</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>It seems to the writer that the apparent unawareness of the
particular nature of counterrevolutionary events shown on those two
occasions by the older and newer schools of the Marxists is not a mere
personal accident. It is rather bound up, in a hidden way, with the
whole historical character of the Marxian theory of the proletarian
revolution which, in many respects, still carries the birthmarks of
bourgeois revolutionary theory, of Jacobinism and Blanquism.<a href="#02">[2]</a> This
applies particularly to the political aspects of the Marxian theory, to
the Marxian doctrines of the so-called permanent revolution and the
"dictatorship of the proletariat," and to Lenin's doctrine of the
leadership of the revolutionary political party before, during, and
after the conquest of the bourgeois state, as embodied in the "Guiding
Principles on the Rule of the Communist Party" adopted by the second
Communist World Congress of 1920.</p>

<p>From this point of view it becomes possible to approach, in a
rational manner, those vexing problems which, during the last twenty
years, have over and over again assailed and tormented the best Marxian
revolutionaries who had become aware of the striking contradictions
between the uninterrupted existence of the so-called proletarian
dictatorship and the increasing suppression of all proletarian and
socialist, nay even of the most modest democratic and progressive
tendencies, in Soviet Russia:</p>

<p>How did it happen that the workers' state emerging from the
1917 revolution in Russia was slowly and without any "Thermidor" or
"Brumaire" transformed from an instrument of the proletarian revolution
into an instrument of the present-day European counterrevolution? What
is the reason for the particularly close resemblance between the
Communist dictatorship in Russia and its nominal opponents, the fascist
dictatorships in Italy and Germany?</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Within the limit of a short article I cannot deal in detail
with the factual side of this historical development. I merely wish to
trace that uncanny ambiguity by which a revolutionary dictatorship
contained, as it were, from the very beginning its possible future
transformation into a counterrevolutionary state, and a corresponding
ambiguity in the revolutionary Marxian theory itself. If the political
concepts of Marxism were derived from the great tradition of the
bourgeois revolution, if the umbilical cord between Marxism and
Jacobinism was never cut, it seems less paradoxical that the
revolutionary Marxist state in its present development should reflect
that great historical process of decay by which today the leading
sections of the bourgeoisie in every country of Europe abandon their
previous political ideals. It ceases to be inconceivable that the
Russian state in its present structure should act as a powerful lever
in the fascization of Europe.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this inherent ambiguity of the political
doctrines of Marx contains in itself nothing more than an abstract
possibility of that radical degradation. Just as the proletarian
revolution, according to the materialistic principle of Marx, is not
exclusively or primarily a consciously willed action of isolated
groups, of parties or even "classes," so the present capitalistic
counterrevolution is primarily the result of an objective economic
development of society-though, of course, neither a revolutionary nor a
counter revolutionary action will necessarily spring from the mere fact
that it has become economically feasible. Thus, the real source of the
actual transition of the revolutionary workers' state in Russia into
its present counterrevolutionary condition cannot be found in any
particularities of its political form, be it the principle of
"revolutionary dictatorship" itself or, for that matter, the
dictatorship of a (single) party as opposed to a dictatorship of the
revolutionary Soviets or of the proletarian "class" as a whole. We must
rather look for the causes of this gradual metamorphosis of the
political superstructure in the underlying economic development of the
class forces,</p>

<p>There is, according to this materialistic view, little wonder
in the fact that the Russian workers' state could not maintain its
original proletarian revolutionary character when, after the
frustration of all revolutionary movements outside Russia, it was
reduced to a mere driving-belt, transmitting the curbing and
destructive effects of capitalist world economy to the exceedingly
small beginnings of a true socialist economy built up in Soviet Russia
during the years 1918-1919, called the period of
"War&nbsp;Communism." The really remarkable fact consists in the
circumstance that just those new assumedly anti-bourgeois features of
the Russian state which had been devised as a means to defend the
proletarian content of the revolutionary society should have served
(along with the "new" counterrevolutionary states shaped on the very
model of the Russian "dictatorship") as an instrument not only of the
reversal of revolutionary transformation of the whole traditional
framework of European capitalist society. "Though this be madness, yet
there's method in it."</p>

<p>To solve this bewildering problem by sober materialistic
research is one of the main tasks of a Marxian analysis. In attempting
this task we may expect with Hobbes (when in his Behemoth he retraced
the course of the English revolution and counterrevolution of
1640-1660) that we too, looking back as from Devil's Mountain upon the
historical development of the last twenty years, shall have "a prospect
of all kinds of injustice, and of all kinds of folly, that the world
could afford, and how they were produced by their damn hypocrisy and
self-conceit, where of the one is double iniquity and other double
folly"; but at the same time a full insight into the actions which then
took place and into "their causes, pretensions, justice, order,
artifice and event."</p>
