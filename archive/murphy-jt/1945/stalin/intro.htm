<h3>Stalin</h3>
<h4>1879-1944</h4>

<hr class="base" size="1">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h4>By Sir Stafford Cripps, K.C., M.P.</h4>

<p class="fst">THIS book deals with one of the greatest men of all times judged by the immensity of the changes he has brought about in the largest country in the world.
</p>
<p>
He is little understood in the Western world and the knowledge of his past life, his experiences, his beliefs and his purposes are a closed book to millions of people in this country whose lives have been intimately affected by his actions.
</p>
<p>
Jack Murphy has long studied the affairs of Russia, and was himself in the early days of the revolution in personal contact with many of its leaders. He has woven the life of Stalin into the revolutionary developments in the Soviet Union for which he was so largely responsible, and the picture thus given should serve to make clear to the reader both the part which Stalin played and the course which the revolution took.
</p>
<p>
Some part of this book consists of the opinions of the author and with these we may agree or disagree, but the large part is a statement of facts which can be historically verified.
</p>
<p>
These facts have been brought together in an easily readable form which brings out the main points of interest in the development of Stalin&#8217;s policy and in that of the Soviet Union. A great deal of history has been compressed into a small space, but enough to give an accurate conspectus and to whet the appetite of those who wish to make a more thorough research into this profoundly interesting period of history.
</p>
<p>
This knowledge is vital to the understanding of our relationship with the Soviet Union. Unless we appreciate the purpose of the revolution and the policy of the man who has been responsible for its direction ever since the death of Lenin, we shall be incapable of carrying out our own policy of friendship and co-operation with the Soviet Union.
</p>
<p>
Upon the success of this policy our own future and the future of the world will very largely depend. It is then surely worth our while to spend a little time in studying the life and opinions of one who must&#8212;as long as he lives&#8212;continue to have an outstanding influence upon the future of world policies.
</p>
<p>
I myself would, from my own experience, endorse the views expressed by Mr. Winston Churchill after his first meeting with Marshal Stalin in Moscow.

<p class="quote">
It is very fortunate for Russia in her agony to have this rugged chief at her head. He is a man of outstanding personality, suited to the sombre and stormy times in which his life has been cast. He is a man of inexhaustible courage and will-power, a man of direct and even blunt speech. Above all, he is a man with a saving sense of humour which is of high importance to all men and to all nations. Premier Stalin left upon me an impression of deep, cool wisdom and a complete absence of illusions of any kind.
</p>
<p>
Those who read this book will, I think, endorse those words of our Prime Minister.
