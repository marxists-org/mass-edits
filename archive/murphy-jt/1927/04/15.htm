Moscow, Tuesday
</p>
<p class="fst">
The People&#8217;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs received the following telegram &#8220;from Eugene Chen, the Foreign Minister, Chinese Nationalist Government:&#8212;
</p>
<p class="indent">
&#8220;Have to-day secured confirmation of Chang Tso Lin&#8217;s infamous raid on the Soviet Embassy. None but an international scoundrel could be guilty of such a monstrous crime. While expressing profound regret at this wanton violation of Soviet Sovereignty and dignity, even though it be only the act of a lawless Chinese brigand, the Government have to assure you that strong action will follow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
On behalf of the Soviet Government, Karakhan has replied that the Soviet Government had felt confident that acts of violence and looting by the Peking police would rouse the indignation of the Nationalist Government in favour of the recognition of the independence and sovereignty of China; demands the withdrawal of all British and Indian forces from China, and, if held to be necessary, the evacuation of British nationals from points considered dangerous.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It urges the British Labour Movement to consider means of placing an embargo upon the manufacture of war material and its transport to China, and urgently calls the attention of the public to the gravce danger of war on an extended scale if troops and armaments continue to be poured into China.	
</p>
<p>
It calls for immediate negotiations with the Chinese Nationalist Government, believing that a just settlement both to Britain and China can be obtained.&#8221;
