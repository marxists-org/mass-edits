<em>Moscow, May 21</em> 
</p>
<p class="fst">
&#8220;Pravda&#8221; publishes a letter from Krupskaya, Lenin&#8217;s widow, and one of the Opposition leaders in 1920. She states that last autumn she parted company with the Opposition, considering that in their criticism they had overshot the mark.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Fraternal criticism had degenerated into fractional criticism, which the masses took to be directed against the fundamental principles of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
She calls for more restraint in criticism, and for businesslike discussions; above all for the utmost unity in action and complete co-operation.
