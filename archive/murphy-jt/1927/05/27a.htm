<em>Moscow, May 18</em> 
</p>
<p class="fst">
The Executive Committee of the Communist International begins its quarterly session here to-day. It is expected to last a few days.
</p>
<p>
The agenda is as follows:&#8212;(1) The War danger, (2) Problems of the Chinese Revolution, (3) The Sixth World Congress of the Communist International, (4) Other business.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Pravda&#8221; writes, &#8220;The Plenum has opened at the most critical moment in recent history, when modern capitalism has openly raised the banner of Fascist reaction. The danger of war has already increased. But the Comintern will know how to deal with the question raised by history.&#8221;
