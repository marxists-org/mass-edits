<em>Moscow, May 13</em> 
</p>
<p class="fst">
A big sensation	in Party circles was caused by a speech of Zinoviev&#8217;s at a public meeting on May 5, which is Russia&#8217;s &#8220;Press Day,&#8221; being the fifteenth birthday of the Bolshevik Party organ &#8220;Pravda.&#8221; In his speech he attacked the policy of the Central Committee of the C.P. of the Soviet Union.
</p>
<p>
This attack, at a meeting at which non-party workers were present, is unprecedented in the Bolshevik Party, particularly from a member of the Party Executive, and one who has held such responsible office. The Central Committee, which has remitted the case to the Central Control Commission of the Party, points, out that it is a clear breach of the Opposition&#8217;s pledge last October to give up their disorganising activity.
</p>
<p>
Resolutions adopted by the Moscow and Leningrad D.P.C.&#8217;s describe Zinoviev&#8217;s action as &#8220;intolerable,&#8221; and demand that he be &#8220;called to account.&#8221; Similar resolutions have been passed by a conference of Party members of the Moscow garrison, various factory groups, etc., some of which demand expulsion from the Central Committee.
