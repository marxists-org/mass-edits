Moscow, March 5. 
</p>
<p class="fst">
The tenth anniversary of the March Revolution, 1917, has been celebrated with great enthusiasm throughout the Soviet Union. Street processions, lorries with tableaux of scenes from the Revolution, and dramatic performances were the most prominent features of the celebration.
</p>
<p>
A mass demonstration took place outside Meyerhold&#8217;s &#8220;Revolutionary Theatre,&#8221; where the Society of Former Political Convicts held a ceremonial meeting. A tremendous ovation was given to the veterans of the Revolution.
