</p>
<p>The Polish spy, Penkov Polojuyi, was among those sentenced to death.

The Court established the criminal activities of the Georgian Menshevik Party leaders and their close connection with the Polish General Staff and White Guardist emigres.

<p>
Their purpose was to supervise work in the U.S.S.R. and espionage on behalf of the Polish and French Intelligence Departments, also the creation in Kiev of an illegal secret organisation and other counter revolutionary crimes. All the accused pleaded guilty.
