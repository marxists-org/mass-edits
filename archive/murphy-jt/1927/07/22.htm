<em>Moscow, Wednesday</em></p>

<p class="fst">
The Communist International has issued a manifesto exposing the treacherous part played by the Austrian Social-Democratic leaders.
</p>
<p>
The formation of a special Social-Democratic police to help in shooting down the workers exposes the &#8220;Left&#8221; Austrian Socialists as being no better than Noske and Scheidemann, says the manifesto. Their policy is contrasted with that of the C.P. &#8220;The July thunderstorm over Austria will bring further revolutionary storms.&#8221; It is described as &#8220;a pledge of the revolutionary resistance which the capitalists will meet if they pursue their attack, and of what they must expect if they dare to realise their military plans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The Communist International gives the watchwords &#8220;Continuation of the General Strike! Arm the Austrian workers! Disarm the Fascist organisation and police! Form Soviets throughout the country! Down with the Seipel Government! All power to a Workers&#8217; and Peasants&#8217; Government!&#8221;
