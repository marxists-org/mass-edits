<p class="fst">
In his Report to the forthcoming congress of the International Federation of Trade Union (Amsterdam) Oudegeest, the Secretary, makes a virulent attack on the Russian workers in connection with the help they rendered to the miners during the lockout last year.
</p>
<p>
Oudegeest actually tries to convince the Trade Union Movement that the million pounds sent by the Soviet workers were sent only for the purpose of propaganda.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Trud,&#8221; the organ of the Soviet trade unions, comments that this sort of attack hits not the Soviet trade unions, but the &#8220;Reformist&#8221; leaders, who are helping the capitalists in their attack on the workers in Russia and other countries.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The Soviet workers,&#8221; says &#8220;Trud,&#8221; &#8220;helped their British brethren because they considered the struggle of international importance. The British miners&#8217; victory would have been a great victory for the workers of the world. The miners know who helped them with money and propaganda on their behalf, and who broke the struggle by sabotage and propaganda on behalf of the bosses.&#8221;
