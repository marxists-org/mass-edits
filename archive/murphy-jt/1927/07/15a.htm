Right Wing leaders, as well as Capitalist politicians, appear to be persistently inspiring the rumours that the Soviet trade unions are intent on breaking up the Anglo-Russian Committee.
</p>
<p>
I have interviewed many responsible leaders of Soviet trade unions, and with one accord they all insist that these rumours are not only false but malicious in their purpose. Both the rank and file and the leaders of the Soviet unions want to see the Anglo-Russian Committee fulfilling its proper duty in the fight against the offensive of capitalism, for trade union unity, and against the military preparations of British Imperialism. The discontinuance of the Anglo-Russian Committee would be due only to the passiveness and the sabotage of the British General Council Section of the Committee.
