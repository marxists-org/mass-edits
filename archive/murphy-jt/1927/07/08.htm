<em>Moscow, Monday</em> 
</p>
<p class="fst">
In his report to the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, Tomsky said that particular significance was attached to the Anglo-Russian Committee in view of the international situation. For this reason a number of concessions had been made to the British General Council, though Tomsky had definitely refused to surrender his right to freedom of speech.
</p>
<p>
At a preliminary meeting in Berlin on June 17 the British representatives came, not to discuss the question of war but to simply discuss Tomsky&#8217;s interview with <em>Workers&#8217;s Life</em> on the Trades&#8217; Union Bill, which, said Citrine and Hicks, was &#8220;interference in British affairs.&#8221;
</p>
<h5>No Plain Answer</h5>
<p>
The Russian representatives, however, insisted on the necessity for the struggle against war and protested against the General Council&#8217;s failure to call the Anglo-Russian Committee. It was more harmful to postpone the meeting than to refuse openly to call it. The General Council&#8217;s procrastination showed insincerity and lack of good faith, and could only mean that the General Council wanted to break up the Committee. The workers wanted to be clear: Does or does not the Anglo-Russian Committee exist? Why is it inactive? And who is responsible for this inactivity?
</p>
<p>
The British representatives gave no plain reply to this.
</p>
<p>
Continuing, Tomsky said that the Russian worker had helped the miners, despite the General Council, to the extent of £1,000,000 and would he]p all workers&#8217; whenever and wherever help was needed. &#8220;Let the workers of Britain,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the workers had helped the miners, despite the and the policy of the General Council. We are not afraid of their judgment.
