<h3>Russia on the March: a study of Soviet Foreign Policy</h3>

<hr class="base" size="1">
<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p class="fst">I HAD just received the proofs of this book when, with dramatic suddenness, Hitler and his gangsters opened up a new phase of the world war. Without preliminary negotiation or warning their air forces dropped their bombs and their armies crashed across the frontiers of Soviet Russia.
</p>
<p>
The proofs of this book then bore the title <em>Russia Will March</em>. It was written at a time when almost everybody in this country was openly speculating on either some further act of &#8220;appeasement&#8221; on the part of the Soviet leaders, or even a possible partnership between them, and the Nazis. These speculations were the product of the disappointment and complete misunderstanding of the Soviet-Nazi Pact of 1939, as well as of the nature of the second world war now engulfing more than half of the human race.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this book was to clear up these misunderstandings by throwing light on fundamental Soviet Foreign policy, thus enabling readers to see it as the Bolsheviks themselves view it. Unless one can appreciate and understand the other man&#8217;s point of view every effort to achieve a common purpose must end in frustration and dispute.
</p>
<p>
I had long been convinced despite all the prejudices and antipathy that the very mention of Soviet Russia stirs in the minds of most people, both high and low, that this country and Soviet Russia would sooner or later be fighting side by side against the common foe&#8212;Nazi Germany. Now that Soviet Russia has been forced into the war against the real enemy, the purpose of this book is more than ever justified.
</p>
<p>
A new relationship between the Democracies and Soviet Russia has sprung into being overnight by the unleashing of this new phase of the war. The new relationship, arising solely from the common struggle for existence and the determination to destroy Hitlerism, must be strengthened on the basis of common understanding as well as mutual interest. It must be frankly recognized that the two countries Britain and Russia, have dissimilar political systems and that their respective leaders hold entirely different views and philosophies concerning the future of civilization. Even as these two great peoples have been forced into war against a common enemy which threatens all civilization, so we are now called upon to face the course of that struggle and its outcome with equal realism. This can be achieved only through an understanding of each other&#8217;s point of view, to the end that our mutual interest and purpose may march together.
</p>
<p>
It is my opinion that the Foreign policy of the Bolsheviks has, more often than not, been wrongly presented by their friends and misrepresented by their opponents. This is historically proved by the repeated errors in outside observers&#8217; estimates of the course of events. The need for study of Soviet Foreign policy is in no way lessened by the participation of Soviet Russia in the war against Nazism. It is even more necessary. Hence, I agreed with my publisher that this book should stand unaltered except for the addition of this preface and a postscript.
</p>
<p>
Whatever personal satisfaction there may be in the confirmation of my own view of the course of events, it is overshadowed by my anxiety lest the new friendship of Britain and Russia, born out of the present struggle, may be prevented from coming to full fruition by prejudice, ignorance, and misunderstanding. It is my final hope that this little book may help to frustrate and defeat those deadly enemies of human progress.
