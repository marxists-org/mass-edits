<h1>Farewell letter from Che to Fidel Castro</h1>

<hr />


<p class="inline">&laquo; Year of Agriculture &raquo;<br />
Havana, April 1, 1965.</p>

<p class="fst">Fidel:</p>
<p>At this moment I remember many
things: when I met you in Maria Antonia's house, when you proposed I
come along, all the tensions involved in the preparations. One
day they came by and asked who should be notified in case of death,
and the real possibility of it struck us all. Later we knew it was
true, that in a revolution one wins or dies (if it is a real one).
Many comrades fell along the way to victory. </p><p>Today everything has
a less dramatic tone, because we are more mature, but the event
repeats itself. I feel that I have fulfilled the part of my duty that
tied me to the Cuban revolution in its territory, and I say farewell
to you, to the comrades, to your people, who now are mine. </p><p>I
formally resign my positions in the leadership of the party, my post
as minister, my rank of commander, and my Cuban citizenship. Nothing
legal binds me to Cuba. The only ties are of another nature &mdash; those
that cannot be broken as can appointments to posts. </p><p>Reviewing my
past life, I believe I have worked with sufficient integrity and
dedication to consolidate the revolutionary triumph. My only serious
failing was not having had more confidence in you from the first
moments in the Sierra Maestra, and not having understood quickly
enough your qualities as a leader and a revolutionary. </p><p>I have
lived magnificent days, and at your side I felt the pride of
belonging to our people in the brilliant yet sad days of the
Caribbean [Missile] crisis. Seldom has a statesman been more brilliant as
you were in those days. I am also proud of having followed you
without hesitation, of having identified with your way of thinking
and of seeing and appraising dangers and principles. </p><p>Other
nations of the world summon my modest efforts of assistance. I can do
that which is denied you due to your responsibility as the head of Cuba,
and the time has come for us to part. </p><p>You should know that I do
so with a mixture of joy and sorrow. I leave here the purest of my
hopes as a builder and the dearest of those I hold dear. And I leave
a people who received me as a son. That wounds a part of my spirit. I
carry to new battlefronts the faith that you taught me, the
revolutionary spirit of my people, the feeling of fulfilling the most
sacred of duties: to fight against imperialism wherever it may be.
This is a source of strength, and more than heals the deepest of
wounds. </p><p>I state once more that I free Cuba from all
responsibility, except that which stems from its example. If my final
hour finds me under other skies, my last thought will be of this
people and especially of you. I am grateful for your teaching and
your example, to which I shall try to be faithful up to the final
consequences of my acts. </p><p>I have always been identified with the
foreign policy of our revolution, and I continue to be. Wherever I
am, I will feel the responsibility of being a Cuban revolutionary,
and I shall behave as such. I am not sorry that I leave nothing
material to my wife and children; I am happy it is that way. I ask
nothing for them, as the state will provide them with enough to live
on and receive an education. </p><p>I would have many things to say to
you and to our people, but I feel they are unnecessary. Words cannot
express what I would like them to, and there is no point in
scribbling pages.</P>
