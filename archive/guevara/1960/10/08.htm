<p>This is a unique revolution which some
people maintain contradicts one of the most orthodox premises of the
revolutionary movement, expressed by Lenin: &quot;Without a
revolutionary theory there is no revolutionary movement.&quot; It
would be suitable to say that revolutionary theory, as the expression
of a social truth, surpasses any declaration of it; that is to say,
even if the theory is not known, the revolution can succeed if
historical reality is interpreted correctly and if the forces
involved are utilised correctly.  Every revolution always
incorporates elements of very different tendencies which,
nevertheless, coincide in action and in the revolution's most
immediate objectives.</p>
<p>It is clear that if the leaders have an
adequate theoretical knowledge prior to the action, they can avoid
trial and error whenever the adopted theory corresponds to the
reality. 
</p>
<p>The principal actors of this revolution
had no coherent theoretical criteria; but it cannot be said that they
were ignorant of the various concepts of history, society, economics,
and revolution which are being discussed in the world today.</p>
<p>Profound knowledge of reality, a close
relationship with the people, the firmness of the liberator's
objective, and the practical revolutionary experience gave to those
leaders the chance to form a more complete theoretical concept.</p>
<p>The foregoing should be considered an
introduction to the explanation of this curious phenomenon that has
intrigued the entire world: the Cuban Revolution. It is a deed worthy
of study in contemporary world history: the how and the why of a
group of men who, shattered by an army enormously superior in
technique and equipment, managed first to survive, soon became
strong, later became stronger than the enemy in the battle zones,
still later moved into new zones of combat, and finally defeated that
enemy on the battlefield even though their troops were still very
inferior in number.</p>
<p>Naturally we, who often do not show the
requisite concern for theory, will not run the risk of   expounding
the truth of the Cuban Revolution as though we were its masters.  We
will simply try to give the bases from which one can interpret this
truth.  In fact, the Cuban Revolution must be separated into two
absolutely distinct stages: that of the armed action up to January 1,
1959, and the political, economic and social transformations since
then.</p>
<p>Even these two stages deserve further
subdivisions; however, we will not take them from the viewpoint of
historical exposition, but from the viewpoint of the evolution of the
revolutionary thought of its leaders through their contact with the
people.  Incidentally, here one must introduce a general attitude
toward one of the most controversial terms of the modern world:
Marxism.  When asked whether or not we are Marxists, our position is
the same as that of a physicist or a biologist when asked if he is a
&quot;Newtonian,&quot; or if he is a &quot;Pasteurian&quot;.</p>
<p>There are truths so evident, so much a
part of people's knowledge, that it is now useless to discuss them. 
One ought to be &quot;Marxist' with the same naturalness with which
one is &quot;Newtonian&quot; in physics, or &quot;Pasteurian&quot; in
biology, considering that if facts determine new concepts, these new
concepts will never divest themselves of that portion of truth
possessed by the older concepts they have outdated.  Such is the
case, for example, of Einsteinian relativity or of Planck's &quot;quantum&quot;
theory with respect to the discoveries of Newton; they take nothing
at all away from the greatness of the learned Englishman.  Thanks to
Newton, physics was able to advance until it had achieved new
concepts of space.  The learned Englishman provided the necessary
stepping-stone for them.</p>
<p>The advances in social and political
science, as in other fields, belong to a long historical process
whose links are connecting, adding up, moulding and constantly
perfecting themselves.  In the origin of peoples, there exists a
Chinese, Arab or Hindu mathematics; today, mathematics has no
frontiers.  In the course of history there was a Greek Pythagoras, an
Italian Galileo, an English Newton, a German Gauss, a Russian
Lobachevsky, an Einstein, etc.  Thus in the field of social and
political sciences, from Democritus to Marx, a long series of
thinkers added their original investigations and accumulated a body
of experience and of doctrines.</p>
<p>The merit of Marx is that he suddenly
produces a qualitative change in the history of social thought.  He
interprets history, understands its dynamic, predicts the future, but
in addition to predicting it (which would satisfy his scientific
obligation), he expresses a revolutionary concept: the world must not
only be interpreted, it must be transformed.  Man ceases to be the
slave and tool of his environment and converts himself into the
architect of his own destiny.  At that moment Marx puts himself in a
position where he becomes the necessary target of all who have a
special interest in maintaining the old-similar to Democritus before
him, whose work was burned by Plato and his disciples, the ideologues
of Athenian slave aristocracy.  Beginning with the revolutionary
Marx, a political group with concrete ideas establishes itself. 
Basing itself on the giants, Marx and Engels, and developing through
successive steps with personalities like Lenin, Stalin, Mao Tse-tung
and the new Soviet and Chinese rulers, it establishes a body of
doctrine and, let us say, examples to follow.</p>
<p>The Cuban Revolution takes up Marx at
the point where he himself left science to shoulder his revolutionary
rifle.  And it takes him up at that point, not in a revisionist
spirit, of struggling against that which follows Marx, of reviving
&quot;pure&quot; Marx, but simply because up to that point Marx, the
scientist, placed himself outside of the history he studied and
predicted.  From then on Marx, the revolutionary, could fight within
history.</p>
<p>We, practical revolutionaries,
initiating our own struggle, simply fulfil laws foreseen by Marx, the
scientist.  We are simply adjusting ourselves to the predictions of
the scientific Marx as we travel this road of rebellion, struggling
against the old structure of power, supporting ourselves in the
people for the destruction of this structure, and having the
happiness of this people as the basis of our struggle.  That is to
say, and it is well to emphasise this once again: The laws of Marxism
are present in the events of the Cuban Revolution, independently of
what its leaders profess or fully know of those laws from a
theoretical point of view. . .</p>
<p>Each of those brief historical moments
in the guerrilla warfare framed distinct social concepts and distinct
appreciations of the Cuban reality; they outlined the thought of the
military leaders of the revolution-those who in time would also take
their position as political leaders.</p>
<p>Before the landing of the Granma, a
mentality predominated that, to some degree, might be called
&quot;subjectivist&quot;: blind confidence in a rapid popular
explosion, enthusiasm and faith in the power to liquidate the Batista
regime by a swift, armed uprising combined with spontaneous
revolutionary strikes, and the subsequent fall of the dictator. . . .</p>
<p>After the landing comes the defeat, the
almost total destruction of the forces, and their regrouping and
integration as guerrillas.  Characteristic of those few survivors,
imbued with the spirit of struggle, was the understanding that to
count upon spontaneous outbursts throughout the island was a
falsehood, an illusion.  They understood also that the fight would
have to be a long one and that it would need vast campesino
participation.  At this point, the campesinos entered the guerrilla
war for the first time.</p>
<p>Two events - hardly important in terms
of the number of combatants, but of great psychological value - were
unleashed.  First, antagonism that the city people, who comprised the
central guerrilla group, felt towards the campesinos was erased.  The
campesinos, in turn, distrusted the group and, above all, feared
barbarous reprisals of the government.  Two things demonstrated
themselves at this stage, both very important for the interrelated
factors: To the campesinos, the bestialities of the army and all the
persecution would not be sufficient to put an end to the guerrilla
war, even though the army was certainly capable of liquidating the
campesinos' homes, crops, and families.  To take refuge with those in
hiding was a good solution.  In turn, the guerrilla fighters learned
the necessity, each time more pointed, of winning the campesino
masses. . . .</p>
<p>[Following the failure of Batista's
major assault on the Rebel Army,] the war shows a new characteristic:
The correlation of forces turns toward the revolution.  Within a
month and a half, two small columns, one of eighty and the other of a
hundred forty men, constantly surrounded and harassed by an army that
mobilised thousands of soldiers, crossed the plains of Camag&uuml;ey,
arrived at Las Villas, and began the job of cutting the island in
two.</p>
<p>It may seem strange, incomprehensible,
and even incredible that two columns of such small size - without
communications, without mobility, without the most elementary arms of
modern warfare - could fight against well-trained, and above all,
well-armed troops.</p>
<p>Basic [to the victory] is the
characteristic of each group: the fewer comforts the guerrilla
fighter has, the more he is initiated into the rigors of nature, the
more he feels himself at home; his morale is higher, his sense of
security greater.  At the same time, he has learned to risk his life
in every circumstance that might arise, to trust it to luck, like a
tossed coin; and in general, as a final result of this kind of
combat, it matters little to the individual guerrilla whether or not
he survives.</p>
<p>The enemy soldier in the Cuban example,
which we are now considering, is the junior partner of the dictator;
he is the man who gets the last crumbs left to him in a long line of
profiteers that begins in Wall Street and ends with him.  He is
disposed to defend his privileges, but he is disposed to defend them
only to the degree that they are important to him.  His salary and
pension are worth some suffering and some dangers, but they are never
worth his life; if the price of maintaining them will cost it, he is
better off giving them up, that is to say, withdrawing from the face
of guerrilla danger.  From these two concepts and these two morals
springs the difference which would cause the crisis of December 31,
1958 . . . . 
</p>
<p>Here ends the insurrection.  But the
men who arrive in Havana after two years of arduous struggle in the
mountains and plains of Oriente, in the plains of Camag&uuml;ey, and
in the mountains, plains, and cities of Las Villas, are not the same
men, ideologically, who landed on the beaches of Las Coloradas, or
who took part in the first phase of the struggle.  Their distrust of
the campesino has been converted into affection and respect for his
virtues; their total ignorance of life in the country has been
converted into a knowledge of the needs of our guajiros; their
flirtations with statistics and with theory have been fixed by the
cement which is practice.</p>
<p>With the banner of Agrarian Reform, the
execution of which begins in the Sierra Maestra, these men confront
imperialism.  They know that the Agrarian Reform is the basis upon
which the new Cuba must build itself.  They know also that the
Agrarian Reform will give land to all the dispossessed, but that it
will dispossess its unjust possessors; and they know that the
greatest of the unjust possessors are also influential men in the
State Department or in the government of the United States of
America.  But they have learned to conquer difficulties with bravery,
with audacity and, above all, with the support of the people; and
they have now seen the future of liberation that awaits us on the
other side of our sufferings.</p>
