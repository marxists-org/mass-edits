 A good source
for the activities of Ernesto Che Guevara's leadership of the Cuban Economy
after the Revolution is found in a comprehensive biography on the man written
by Paco Ignacio Taibo II and translated into English by Martin Roberts.&nbsp;
Taibo is a Mexican writer who conducted interviews of many of the participants
of the Cuban Revolution of 1956-1959 concerning their memories of Che Guevara.&nbsp;
His research is very complete, using reports from the Cuban Government
and texts and speeches by Guevara, and probably a good half of the text
in his book are the words of Che Guevara himself.&nbsp; It has been said
by Taibo, and agreed with by those who reviewed this book, that Guevara
was the second narrator of this book.&nbsp; The book is an excellent source
for Che's activities, contains a huge reference section of articles about
Che's work and life and proved invaluable to the writting of this short
essay.

<p>During the Cuban
Revolution of 1956-1959, led by Fidel Castro, which Ernesto Che Guevara
participated in and became a commander in the Rebel Army, the goals of
the Revolution changed from one of deposing the Dictator Fulgencio Batista,
to a broader based social and economic movement, which featured agrarian
reform as one of its main tenants.&nbsp; A large part of the Guerilla forces
led by Castro and Guevara, sometimes above 80 percent, were peasants, some
dispossessed, all abused by feudal land arrangements of Cuba before the
Revolution.&nbsp; Many of the campesinos worked day in and day out for
just barely enough to support a family.&nbsp; Nearly all the peasants were
diseased or malnourished.&nbsp; This fact led Castro and Guevara to understand
the need for the Agrarian Reform program instituted soon after the Revolution
was accomplished, while they were still fighting the Revolutionary War
(Guevara, 102).</p>
<p>Che's agrarian
program was simple.&nbsp; It was the Zapatista line of "Land for those
who work it."&nbsp; This seemed simple to him and was justified by the
reality of the countryside, where those who worked the land had nothing
and it caused all sorts of problems.&nbsp; This line was subverted by leaders
of the national movement which was supposedly coordinating activities with
revolutionary aims throughout the country. In reality there were several
factions within the national movement that were decidedly against each
other, and in fact fought with each other and stole from each other, and
there was, as was revealed after the Revolution ended indeed no harmony
between those who had different agendas.&nbsp; By November 1958, Che's
version of Agrarian Reform was being put into place in the "liberated zone"
(the zone controlled by the Rebel Army), which included confiscation of
land owned by those who sympathized with Batista, and a granting of land
to all those who had worked it or paid rent on it for 2 years or more.&nbsp;
This caused all sorts of problems among the revolution's "allies", who
turned out to be opportunists and tried to block the reform where they
could not gain some advantage.&nbsp; Among those whose agenda ran counter
to the Revolutionary program was a group called Front II who operated in
the Sierra Escambray Mountains, near the town of Sancti-Spiritu and insisted
on collecting dues on the agrarian programs instituted by the Revolutionary
J-26 Movement (Taibo, 211).&nbsp; Earlier in the struggle, a provisional
government created by the revolution's "allies" in Miami, Florida, was
condemned for their opportunistic tendencies by Fiedel Castro.&nbsp; This
group of Cuban "Revolutionary" leaders (which included some in the city
component of the Revolutionary J-26 Movement) decided,&nbsp; without including
representation, or even consultation with those who were actually conducting
the Revolution in the Sierra Maestra, that the government would be a coalition
government of all the "revolutionary" movements throughout Cuba (Guevara,
211-227).&nbsp; These and several other things, (including banditry in
the name of the Revolution and the desire among several other "revolutionary"
elements for a military junta in Havana) led to early controversy in the
Revolutionary movement of Cuba.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the Revolution,
the conflict came to a head.&nbsp; Che leading the Rebel Army, felt that
the Rebel Army should be the guarenteeors of the agrarian reform, since
the army was made of those who were peasants and those peasants were fighting
not only for the Revolution, but indeed that they were fighting for a better
way for the peasants of Cuba.&nbsp; Before the agrarian question was settled,
the Cuban government in March nationalized the telephone company, and the
public transportation system, and then ordered rents cut in half and lowering
of the price of medicine.&nbsp; This was certainly the flavor of the Cuban
government to come.&nbsp; The Agrarian Reform Law was signed into effect
in May of 1959.&nbsp; It confiscated plantations over 1000 acres and then
paid for the expropriation with bonds maturing in 29 years. Then these
lands would be turned into farm co-ops run by the government or split up
among the peasants who lived on them.&nbsp; Che rejected the act's moderation,
calling it a "timid law, which did not take on so basic a task as suppressing
the plantation owners" (Taibo, 277).</p>
<p>The Cuban Government
took heat for this act from both sides.&nbsp; From the left, Castro was
accused of mollifying large landowners and from the right he was accused
of betraying the revolution by changing the aims of the movement from eliminating
the dictatorship to agrarian reform.&nbsp; But as it happened, this was
the agrarian reform that was presented in Cuba after the revolution, and
from it Che moved on to other things.</p>
<p>On October 7,
1959, Che became the director of the Industrialization program of the National
Agrarian Reform Institute (INRA) (Taibo, 288).&nbsp; His job was to coordinate
activities among the nation's industries which had been nationalized over
the past 10 months.&nbsp; Che's job consisted of keeping the business under
his direction going no matter what.&nbsp; Carlos Rodriguez, in a speech
in 1987 described the purpose behind this very well.&nbsp; These businesses
were necessary, even if they weren't what capitalists would call "profitable."&nbsp;
They provided things the people of Cuba needed.&nbsp; They weren't profitable,
because they had to be practically given to people of Cuba, who had little
money.&nbsp; These products included such commodities as medicines and
other essentials.&nbsp; Che instituted a system where the workplaces would
be organized as to what they produce, and the economy would be funded by
a central funding agency tied to the Cuban treasury.&nbsp; From there it
would be easier to coordinate different businesses in the Cuban economy,
and direct for production.&nbsp; This was another step in making Cuba a
Communist nation (the agrarian reform was the first).&nbsp; Around this
time Che also instituted a principle known as Voluntary labor, which consisted
of men doing work for free during a day.&nbsp; It was the beginning of
Che's philosophy of "a new man", where people worked for the benefit of
society and from that an individual received his reward.&nbsp; This "moral"
incentive (as opposed to a material one, where the worker receives a monetary
incentive or a house or something for working hard) was far more important
to Che's "New" man because it involved improving the lives of the many
over the life of the individual.</p>
<p>In late November
1959, Che became the head of the National Bank of Cuba.&nbsp; When he took
on the job, he left the job at the INRA to Orlando Borrego.&nbsp; But Che
still oversaw the work at the INRA and returned to the work within the
next year.&nbsp; Che immediately set to reforming the banking system, despite
the lack of skilled economists within the bank.&nbsp; Che mentioned that
foreign money interests had a hand in virtually every aspect of the Cuban
economy, and this would cause great problems as the Revolution depended.&nbsp;
Che implemented several controls over the amount of foreign currency held
in reserve by Cuba.&nbsp; One of Guevara's main problems in the running
of the Cuban National bank was trying to control capital flight from Cuba
after the Revolution.&nbsp; With no capital, Cuba was not able to industrialize.&nbsp;
Much of the capital flight early on in Che's administration was offset
by a discount in the loans Cuba received for foreign nations.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
Che did have success in the area of the agrarian reform while with the
bank, and was proud to sign the first deeds of the peasants for the lands
they had been given.</p>
<p>Later, in 1960,
as the Soviet Union was offering to help Cuba financially, Che began to
understand the real problem of Cuban industrial development to be that
Cuba is producing only raw materials while manufactured goods had to be
imported.&nbsp; This added up to a trade deficit from which Cuba could
never recover, as long as it only manufactured raw materials. Che, along
with others in the Government set about on a plan to eradicate Cuba's imports,
by buying factories and machinery from Eastern European nations.&nbsp;
He organized the bookkeeping apparatus in Cuba's economy to offset the
monetary losses of some "unprofitable" industries with the gain of others,
thus allowing the Cuban economy to continue without laying off more workers.&nbsp;
Che rejected the appeals for raising wages, saying that if there were no
increase in manufacture, raises would amount to simply printing more money,
and then the money would be worth less, and people would become poorer.&nbsp;
This explanation is an indication of Che's simple, yet poignant view of
the economic principles upon which a socialist nation could lay.&nbsp;
Cuba would have to produce more for there to be raises, and yet the Cuban
economy continued in its course of rapid industrialization. Throughout
this time, Che continued to work with voluntary labor brigades every weekend,
setting the example for the entire countryside.</p>
<p>In the beginning
of July, the United States stopped importing sugar from Cuba.&nbsp; It
was the first sign of trouble for the Cuban economy.&nbsp; The cancellation
of the sugar quota marked the beginning of the blockade of Cuba by America.&nbsp;
The Soviet Union was quick to buy up the surplus of sugar which the Americans
had refused to buy.&nbsp; Cuba became a cold war pawn, as the United States
refused to trade with Cuba, and the Soviet Union picked up the opportunity,
and then the United States admonished Cuba for trading with her cold war
enemy.&nbsp; The Cuban Government returned the favor by nationalizing foreign
assets within Cuba, to include oil and sugar refineries which were owned
by Americans.&nbsp; It was a viscious cycle which led to the severing of
all ties between America and Cuba, and the thrust of Cuba into the waiting
arms of The Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Here Che's early
criticism of the Soviet Union became apparent.&nbsp; Taibo's biography
tells of a meeting Guevara had with French economist Rene Dumont.&nbsp;
Dumont suggested, as Taibo puts it , that "nationalization and state takeovers
[do] not necessarily add up to socialism" (Taibo, 306) that peasants did
not feel like they owned the business that they operated, and this would
lead to absenteeism and theft from the co-operatives.&nbsp; Che's opposition
to the co-operatives was voiced here, saying it would set up a system like
America's in socialist nations, where workers work for material gain, rather
for the benefit of society.&nbsp; Che's notion of the "new man" spoken
of before was developing here.&nbsp; People were, according to Che's economic
thought, to work for the benefit of society, and from that receive their
benefit.&nbsp; The co-operative then involved a heightened sense of individual
ownership rather than work for the good of all, and it promoted a continued
atomization of the workers (peasants included) for individual gains.&nbsp;
This is why there is theft, because there is individual greed and motivation.&nbsp;
This is why there is absenteeism, because workers don't see the benefit
for all of society in their work, or they discount their work's importance.&nbsp;
This is why there is not increased production, because the workers are
waiting for material incentives which will not come, which cannot come.&nbsp;
The Soviet system tries to incorporate worker ownership into its model,
where what is needed is instead worker responsibility.&nbsp; This notion
of the "new" man had permeated Che's economic thinking by mid 1960.</p>
<p>By October 1960,
a report was compiled showing the critical state of the Cuban economy.&nbsp;
It was with-held from Guevara's opinion.&nbsp; This report stated that
Cuba's economic reserves would dry up in four months (Taibo, 309). On October
13, the United States declared an embargo on all goods entering and leaving
Cuba.&nbsp; Cuba, in response, nationalized more sugar mills, banks and
factories, giving Che's INRA a total of about 615 business to run, along
with&nbsp; 160 sugar mills and all the mines on the island (Taibo, 309).&nbsp;
This of course caused predictions for shortages, due to a skyrocket of
demand (due to increased real wages among Cuban citizens after the Revolution
and inability to import) in eggs and razor blades.&nbsp; This was the first
sector to be hurt by the American blockade.&nbsp; Consumer goods disappeared
over the next few years, as the Cuban economy tried to shift emphasis toward
manufactured goods that it still had to import but could not now.&nbsp;
Medicine was an early casualty of the embargo, and the United States turned
a deaf ear to the fact that the embargo was killing Cuban citizens because
the Cuban government did not have sufficient pharmaceuticals to treat people
who were ill.</p>
<p>In late October
1960, Che was again abroad.&nbsp; His first stop was in Czechoslovakia
where he obtained&nbsp; a sizable credit, and then he continued to Moscow,
where the Cold War political game continued to be played out.&nbsp; Moscow
announced that whatever Cuba needs they shall have.&nbsp; This declaration
of close association was the start of several long term problems in Cuba's
economy, the first and most notable being the Cuban Missile Crisis just
a year and a half later and the over reliance of the Cuban Economy on the
Soviet Union which collapsed in 1989, tearing the Cuban economy down with
it and almost causing the end of the Revolution in Cuba.&nbsp; Che went
on to China and received a 60 million dollar credit from China, as well
as a promise from the Chinese to buy Cuban sugar.&nbsp; Guevara got guarantees
from North Vietnam and East Germany.&nbsp; Upon returning to the USSR,
Che had found outlets for the entire harvest of Cuban sugar.</p>
<p>In late February,
1961, the Industrial Department (the INRA) became the Ministry of Industry,
and Guevara was appointed its Minister.&nbsp; He drafted a board of directors
and set about to develop a centralized approach to governing the economy
of Cuba.&nbsp; This included centralized planning of the output and centralized
control of the finances of the economy.&nbsp; Immediately the ministry
set about reorganizing the workforce so there was more people cutting sugar
or picking coffee, and less people working in the surplus labor conditions
of the factories.&nbsp; The goal was to keep people in work, to keep unprofitable
blockaded industries working.&nbsp; This was done mainly through volunteer
labor programs.&nbsp; In March, rationing was declared for milk, meat,
shoes and toothpaste (Taibo, 322).&nbsp; Che insisted that even ministers
of the government obey the ration.</p>
<p>At the end of
April 1961, Che declared that all ministers will visit their factories
twice a month or be docked pay.&nbsp; About the same time he announced
that Industrial output had increased, which was excellent news.&nbsp; This
included a 75 percent growth in steel and iron output.&nbsp; He also outlawed
interrogations in the workplace concerning political ideologies of workers,
in the wake of the Bay of Pigs invasion.&nbsp; However demand was fast
outpacing supply and there was inflation.&nbsp; There were problems installing
machinery purchased from Eastern Europe because there was not factories
to install the machines in.&nbsp; The Cuban economy was traveling forward
on what Taibo called "revolutionary momentum" (Taibo, 331).&nbsp; Later
in 1961, at a National Production meeting, Che harshly spoke of the lack
of quality control in Cuba.&nbsp; All the increases in production meant
nothing if none of the products were any good.&nbsp; He commented, as an
example of how the Coca Cola tasted like cough syrup.&nbsp; He sharply
criticized the industries for considering quality counterrevolutionary.&nbsp;
Despite it all, living standards were 60 percent higher in 1961 than they
had been in 1959 (Taibo, 340).</p>
<p>In early 1962,
Guevara attacked the problem of wage discrepancies, which eventually led
to the simplifying of the wage scales in Cuba, and leveled wages downward.&nbsp;
Further attempts to reorganize volunteer labor programs were made to make
it more cost effective.&nbsp; In 1963, Che announced a switch in tactics
of the Cuban economy from making new investments to consolidation of those
Cuba had already made.&nbsp; Furthermore, a program for education of managers
and workers was underway, at Che's insistence.&nbsp; He also criticized
the growing beurocracy that caused inefficiency in production.&nbsp; At
the beginning of 1964, Che unveiled the new industrial investment plan
which was smaller than the previous year's, and included a higher emphasis
on agricultural products.&nbsp; This was the first step in Cuba's long
plan to return to sugar manufacture being chief among concerns.&nbsp; As
well, Che continued (and put more emphasis in fact) to working volunteer
labor.&nbsp; Taibo quotes reports from the Ministry of Industry that say
Che put in more then 240 hours of volunteer labor in the first half of
1964, among all his other responsibilities.&nbsp; The Ministry of Industry
combined had put in 1,683,000 hours (Taibo, 385).</p>
<p>In late 1964,
Che Guevara went to New York to speak before the United Nations.&nbsp;
He then completed a whirlwind tour of Latin America and Africa, before
returning to Cuba.&nbsp; Upon returning, Che decided that he would go to
the Congo to support the Revolution there and try to bring Cuban guerilla
tactics to a nation struggling against an oppressive dictatorship.&nbsp;
He resigned all his offices and renounced his citizenship of Cuba and gave
away all his property.&nbsp; Guerilla was the vocation he decided he would
return to and this is the vocation he had when he died.</p>
<p>The Cuban experience
was one fraught with mistakes made because of inexperience.&nbsp; Che was
never one to hide facts, and he was always self critical.&nbsp; But no
matter what, one fact remains that no capitalistic critic of Che Guevara
or the Cuban revolution will ever be able to erase.&nbsp; The people of
Cuba enjoyed a better life after the revolution than before it.&nbsp; Illiteracy
was wiped out.&nbsp; Unemployment was eliminated.&nbsp; Cuba became somewhat
of an industrial power.&nbsp; It may have hurt making the transition, but
the pain was necessary.&nbsp; In April 1961, the United States sponsored
the failed invasion of Cuba, called in America, "The Bay of Pigs".&nbsp;
The invasion was aborted because the Cuban people did not raise up to greet
the exiled invaders with open arms, as the American government expected
they would.&nbsp; The Cuban people instead, defended the Revolution, and
formed militias which stopped the invasion on the beach where it had landed.&nbsp;
The Cuban people were in full support and in full defense of the Revolution
at the place called Giron Beach.&nbsp; Che summed up the Revolution, and
the progress of the Revolution&nbsp; to that point in History when he explained
why there was no popular support for the invasion that America had looked
for with the following words: "You can't expect that a man who was given
a thousand acres by his father and just shows up here to get his thousand
acres back won't be killed by a countryman who used to have nothing, and
now has a terrible urge to kill the guy because he [the inheritor] wants
to take his [the defender] land away from him." (Taibo, 327) .</p>
