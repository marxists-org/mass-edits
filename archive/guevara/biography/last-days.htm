      The combined units of Company A and the supporting units from
      Company B <span class="inote">[a combined force of 1,300 Bolivian men,
      tranined by US Special Forces and directed by the CIA for the specific task of capturing Che Guevara. Che's
      guerilla squad had 17 men.]</span> moved into the area of
      the Churro Ravine using two squads of Company A as a blocking
      force a few kms north of the small Geino Ravine. Cpt. Prado set
      up his mortar section east of the Churro Ravine, with 3rd
      Platoon of Company B to his rear in support, under the command
      of Sgt. Huauca. 1st Platoon of Company A, under the command of
      Lt. Perez, entered the Churro Ravine to the north at the
      confluence of two small streams. Lt. Perez initiated the pursuit
      and began driving the guerrilla force south while Cpt. Prado's
      mortars shelled the ravine. At this point a machine gun was
      brought up to also cover the ravine and hold the left flank of
      Prado's mortar section and supporting troops. As the 1st Platoon
      of Company A pushed south they came under fire and lost 3
      soldiers immediately. Cpt. Prado then ordered Sgt. Huauca to
      move down the small Tuscal Ravine and wait at the entrance of
      the Churro Ravine. The 3rd Platoon of Company B carried out this
      order and after finding nothing, was ordered to enter the Churro
      Ravine and gain pursuit in the direction of Lt. Perez's
      platoon. Sgt. Huauca immediately encountered a group of 6 to 8
      guerillas and opened fire. At this point they killed "Anotondo"
      and "Orturo", two Cubans. Sgt. Huauca lost one soldier here and
      another was wounded. "Ramon" (Guevara) and "Willy" tried to
      break out in the direction of the mortar section. They were
      sighted by the machine gun crew which took them under
      fire. "Ramon" (Guevara) was hit in the lower calf and was helped
      by "Willy" [Sarabia] toward the Tuscal Ravine where apparently
      they rested for a few minutes. They then moved north, directly
      in front of Cpt. Prado who ordered several soldiers to chase
      them. Soldiers Encinos, Cheques, and Balboa were the first
      Bolivians to lay hands on Guevara. "Willy" and "Ramon" (Guevara)
      were later transported back to La Higueras with Cpt. Prado and
      the elements of Companies A and B. The Bolivians did not remain
      in position after nightfall. From 1900 hrs until 0400 hrs on the
      9th, there were no significant Bolivian troops in the area of
      the fire fight. This gave the guerilla force ample time to
      escape the area, but either due to confusion after the battle or
      poor evaluation of the situation by their leaders, the guerilla
      force remained in the Churro Ravine.

<p>
      On 30 October 67, at a small pavilion in La Esperanza, Bolivia,
      Lt. Ral. Espinoza Lord, Company B, 2nd Ranger Bn, stated the
      following in regards to the handling of Ernest "Che"
      guevara. Guevara and "Willy" were transported back to La
      Hiqueras on the afternoon of the 8th, after the battle at the
      Churro Ravine. Guevara had a slight wound in the lower calf,
      which was treated upon returning to La Hiqueras. Lt. Espinoza
      talked at length with Guevara, though Guevara did not reveal any
      pertinent information. Espinoza felt a high regard for Guevara
      as a soldier and a man, and was anxious to know more of this
      "legendary figure". Guevara answered all of his question[s] with
      remarks such as "perhaps" or "possibly". Early in the morning of
      the 9th of October, the unit received the order to execute
      Guevara and the other captives. Previously, Col. Santana,
      Commander of the 8th Division, had given express orders to keep
      the prisoners alive. The Officers involved did not know where
      the order originated, but felt that it came from the highest
      echelons <sup class="ednote"><a href="#1" name="1b">[A]</a></sup>. Cpt. Frado gave
      the order to execute Guevara to Lt. Perez, but he was unable to
      carry out the order and in turn gave it to Sgt. Terran, Company
      A. At this time Perez asked Guevara if there was anything he
      wished before his execution. Guevara replied that he only wished
      to "die with a full stomach". Perez asked him if he was a
      "materialist", by having requested only food. Guevara returned
      to his previous tranquil manner and answered only
      "perhaps". Perez then called him a "poor shit" and left the
      room. By this time, Sgt. Terran had fortified his courage with
      several beers and returned to the room where Guevara stood up,
      hands tied in front, and stated, "I know what you have come for,
      I am ready." Terran looked at him for a few minutes and then
      said, "No you are mistaken, be seated." Sgt. Terran then left
      the room for a few moments.
</p>
<p>
      "Willy", the prisoner taken with Guevara, was being held in a
      small house a few metres away. While Terran was waiting outside
      to get his nerves back, Sgt. Huauca entered and shot "Willy."
      "Willy" was a Cuban and according to the sources had been an
      instigator of the riots among the miners in Bolivia. Guevara
      heard the burst of fire in his room and for the first time
      appeared to be frightened. Sgt. Terran returned to the room
      where Guevara was being held. When he entered, Guevara stood and
      faced him. Sgt. Terran told Guevara to be seated but he refused
      to sit down and stated, "I will remain standing for this." The
      Sgt. began to get angry and told him to be seated again, but
      Guevara would say nothing. Finally Guevara told him, "Know this
      now, you are [only] killing a man." Terran then fired a burst from his
      M2 carbine, knocking Guevara back into the wall of the small
      house.<sup class="ednote"><a href="#2" name="2b">[B]</a></sup>

     <sup class="ednote"><a href="#1b" name="1">[A]</a></sup> Excerpt from <a
      href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB5/">The
      Death of Che Guevara</a>, explaining Rodriguez's (the CIA agent
      responsible for the tactical movements of Company A and B) role
      in Che's execution:
</p>
<p class="quote">
	Although he apparently was under CIA instructions to "do
	everything possible to keep him alive," Rodriguez transmitted
	the order to execute Guevara from the Bolivian High Command to
	the soldiers at La Higueras &mdash; he also directed them not to
	shoot Guevara in the face so that his wounds would appear to
	be combat-related [to cover up the illegal execution without trial] &mdash; and personally informed Che that he would
	be killed. After the execution, Rodriguez took Che's Rolex
	watch, often proudly showing it to reporters during the
	ensuing years.
</p>


<p class="fst">
      <sup class="ednote"><a href="#2b" name="2">[B]</a></sup> An alternative version
      of these events, as told by CIA Agent Felix Rodriguez, who
      ordered Che's execution:
</p>
<p class="quote">
	1:30 p.m.: Che's final battle commences in Quebrada del
	Yuro. Simon Cuba (Willy) Sarabia, a Bolivian miner, leads the
	rebel group. Che is behind him and is shot in the leg several
	times. Sarabia picks up Che and tries to carry him away from
	the line of fire. The firing starts again and Che's beret is
	knocked off. Sarabia sits Che on the ground so he can return
	the fire. Encircled at less than ten yards distance, the
	Rangers concentrate their fire on him, riddling him with
	bullets. Che attempts to keep firing, but cannot keep his gun
	up with only one arm. He is hit again on his right leg, his
	gun is knocked out of his hand and his right forearm is
	pierced. As soldiers approach Che, he shouts, "Do not shoot! I
	am Che Guevara and worth more to you alive than dead." The
	battle ends at approximately 3:30 p.m. Che is taken prisoner....
   </p>
      <p class="quote">
Rodriguez enters the schoolhouse to tell Che of the orders from the Bolivian high command. Che understands and says, "It is better like this ... I never should have been captured alive." Che gives Rodriguez a message for his wife and for Fidel, they embrace, and Rodriguez leaves the room.
