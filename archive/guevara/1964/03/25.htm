Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)&nbsp;

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

    <p>The delegation of Cuba, an island nation situated
    at the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico in the Caribbean Sea, is addressing you.
    It addresses you under the protection of its rights, on many grounds, to
    come to this forum and proclaim the truth about itself. It addresses you
    first of all, as a country that is building socialism; as a country
    belonging to the group of Latin American nations, even though decisions
    contrary to law have temporarily severed it from the regional organization,
    owing to the pressure exerted and the action taken by the United States of
    America. Its geographical position indicates it is an underdeveloped country
    that addresses you, one which has borne the scars of colonialist and
    imperial exploitation and which knows from bitter experience the subjection
    of its markets and its entire economy, or what amounts to the same thing,
    the subjection of its entire governmental machinery to a foreign power. Cuba
    also addresses you as a country under attack.</p>
    <p>All these features have given our country a prominent place in the news
    throughout the world, in spite of its small size, its limited economic
    importance, and its meager population.
    <p>At this conference, Cuba will express its views from the various
    stand-points which reflect its special situation in the world, but it will
    base its analysis on its most important and positive attribute: that of a
    country which is building socialism. As an underdeveloped Latin American
    country, it will support the main demands of its fraternal countries, and as
    a country under attack it will denounce from the very outset all the
    machinations set in train by the coercive apparatus of that imperial power,
    the United States of America.
    <p>We preface our statement with these words of explanation because our
    country considers it imperative to define accurately the scope of the
    conference, its meaning, and its possible importance.
    <p>We come to this meeting seventeen years after the Havana Conference,
    where the intention was to create a world order that suited the competitive
    interests of the imperialist powers. Although Cuba was the site of that
    Conference, our revolutionary government does not consider itself bound in
    the slightest by the role then played by a government subordinated to
    imperialist interests, nor by the content or scope of the so-called Havana
    Charter.
    <p>At that conference, and at the previous meeting at Bretton Woods, a group
    of international bodies were set up whose activities have been harmful to
    the interests of the dependent countries of the contemporary world. And even
    though the United States of America did not ratify the Havana Charter
    because it considered it too &quot;daring&quot;, the various international
    credit and financial bodies and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
    which were the tangible outcome of those two meetings, have proved to be
    effective weapons for defending its interests, and what is more, weapons for
    attacking our countries.
    <p>These are subjects which we must deal with at length later on.
    <p>Today the conference agenda is broader and more realistic because it
    includes, among others, three of the crucial problems facing the modern
    world: the relations between the camp of the socialist countries and that of
    the developed capitalist countries; the relations between the underdeveloped
    countries and the developed capitalist powers; and the great problem of
    development for the dependent world.
    <p>The participants at this new meeting far outnumber those who met at
    Havana in 1947. Nevertheless, we cannot say with complete accuracy that this
    is the forum of the peoples of the world. The result of the strange legal
    interpretations which certain powers still use with impunity is that
    countries of great importance in the world are missing from this meeting:
    for example the People's Republic of China, the sole lawful representative
    of the most populous nation on earth, whose seats are occupied by a
    delegation which falsely claims to represent that nation, and which, to add
    to the anomaly, even enjoys the right of veto in the United Nations.
    <p>It should also be noted that delegations representing the Democratic
    Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the genuine
    governments of those nations, are absent, while representatives of the
    governments of the southern parts of both those divided states are present;
    and to add to the absurdity of the situation, while the German Democratic
    Republic is unjustly excluded, the Federal Republic of Germany is attending
    this conference and is given a Vice Presidency. And while the socialist
    republics I mentioned are not represented here, the government of the Union
    of South Africa, which violates the Charter of the United Nations by the
    inhuman and fascist policy of apartheid embodied in its national laws, and
    which defies the United Nations by refusing to transmit information on the
    territories which it holds in trust, makes bold to occupy a seat in this
    hall.
    <p>Because of these anomalies the conference cannot be defined as the forum
    of the world's peoples. It is our duty to point this out and draw it to the
    attention of the participants, because so long as this situation persists,
    and justice remains the tool of a few powerful interests, legal
    interpretations will continue to be made to suit the convenience of the
    oppressor powers and it will be difficult to relax the prevailing tension: a
    situation which entails real dangers for mankind. We also stress these facts
    in order to call attention to the responsibilities incumbent upon us and to
    the consequences that may result from the decisions taken here. A single
    moment of weakness, wavering, or compromise may discredit us in the eyes of
    history, just as we, the member states of the United Nations, are in a sense
    accomplices and bear on our hands the blood of Patrice Lumumba, Prime
    Minister of the Congolese, who was wretchedly murdered at a time when United
    Nations troops were presumably 'guaranteeing the stability' of his regime.
    What is worse, those troops had been expressly requested by the martyr,
    Patrice Lumumba.
    <p>Events of such gravity, or other similar events, or those which have
    negative implications for international relations and which jeopardize our
    prestige as sovereign nations, must not be allowed to happen at this
    conference.
    <p>We live in a world that is deeply and antagonistically divided into
    groupings of nations very dissimilar in economic, social, and political
    outlook. In this world of contradictions, the one existing between the
    socialist countries and the developed capitalist countries is spoken of as
    the fundamental contradiction of our time. The fact that the cold war,
    conceived by the warmongering West, has shown itself lacking in practical
    effectiveness and in political realism is one of the factors that have led
    to the convening of this conference. But while that is the most important
    contradiction, it is nevertheless not the only one; there is also the
    contradiction between the developed capitalist countries and the world's
    underdeveloped nations; and at this Conference on Trade and Development, the
    contradictions existing between these groups of nations are also of
    fundamental importance. In addition there is the inherent contradiction
    between the various developed capitalist countries, which struggle
    unceasingly among themselves to divide up the world and to gain a firm hold
    on its markets so that they may enjoy an extensive development based,
    unfortunately, on the hunger and exploitation of the dependent world.
    <p>These contradictions are important; they reflect the realities of the
    world today, and they give rise to the danger of new conflagrations, which,
    in the atomic age, could spread throughout the world.
    <p>If at this egalitarian conference, where all nations can express, through
    their votes the hopes of their peoples, a solution satisfactory to the
    majority can be reached, a unique step will have been taken in the history
    of the world. However, there are many forces at work to prevent this from
    happening. The responsibility for the decisions to be taken devolves upon
    the representatives of the underdeveloped peoples. If all the peoples who
    live under precarious economic conditions, and who depend on foreign powers
    for some vital aspects of their economy and for their economic and social
    structure, are capable of resisting the temptations, offered coldly although
    in the heat of the moment, and impose a new type of relationship here,
    mankind will have taken a step forward.
    <p>If, on the other hand, the groups of underdeveloped countries, lured by
    the siren song of the vested interests of the developed powers which exploit
    their backwardness, contend futilely among themselves for the crumbs from
    the tables of the world's mighty, and break the ranks of numerically
    superior forces; or if they are not capable of insisting on clear
    agreements, free from escape clauses open to capricious interpretations; of
    if they rest content with agreements that can simply be violated at will by
    the mighty, our efforts will have been to no avail, and the long
    deliberations at this conference will result in nothing more than innocuous
    files in which the international bureaucracy will zealously guard the tons
    of printed paper and kilometers of magnetic tape recording the opinions
    expressed by the participants. And the world will remain as it is.
    <p>Such is the nature of this conference. It will have to deal not only with
    the problems involved in the domination of markets and the deterioration in
    the terms of trade but also with the main reason for this state of world
    affairs: the subordination of the national economies of the dependent
    countries to other more developed countries, which, through investment, hold
    sway over the main sectors of their economies.
    <p>It must be clearly understood, and we say it in all frankness, that the
    only way to solve the problems now besetting mankind is to eliminate
    completely the exploitation of dependent countries by developed capitalist
    countries, with all the consequences that this implies. We have come here
    fully aware that what is involved is a discussion between the
    representatives of countries which have put an end to the exploitation of
    man by man, of countries which maintain such exploitation as their working
    philosophy, and of the majority group of the exploited countries. We must
    begin our discussion by acknowledging the truth of the above statements.
    <p>Even when our convictions are so firm that no arguments can change them,
    we are ready to join in constructive debate in a setting of peaceful
    coexistence between countries with different political, economic, and social
    systems. The difficulty lies in making sure that we all know how much we can
    hope to get without having to take it by force, and where to yield a
    privilege before it is inevitably wrung from us by force. The conference has
    to proceed along this difficult, narrow road; if we stray, we shall find
    ourselves on barren ground.
    <p>We announced at the beginning of this statement that Cuba would speak
    here also as a country under attack. The latest developments, which have
    made our country the target of imperialist wrath and the object of every
    conceivable kind of repression and violation of international law, from
    before the time of Playa Giron till now, are known to all. It was no
    accident that Cuba was the main scene of one of the incidents that have most
    gravely endangered world peace, as a result of legitimate action taken by
    Cuba in exercise of its right to adopt the principles of its own people.
    <p>Acts of aggression by the United States against Cuba began virtually as
    soon as the Revolution had been won. In the first stage they took the form
    of direct attacks on Cuban centers of production.
    <p>Later, these acts took the form of measures aimed at paralyzing the Cuban
    economy; about the middle of 1960 an attempt was made to deprive Cuba of the
    fuel needed to operate her industries, transport, and power stations. Under
    pressure from the Department of State, the independent United States oil
    companies refused to sell petroleum to Cuba or to provide Cuba with tankers
    to ship it in. Shortly afterward efforts were made to deprive Cuba of the
    foreign exchange needed for its external trade; a cut of 700,000 short tons
    in the Cuban sugar quota in the United States was made by President
    Eisenhower on July 6, 1960, and the quota was abolished altogether on March
    31, 1961, a few days after the announcement of the Alliance for Progress and
    a few days before Playa Giron. In an endeavor to paralyze Cuban industry by
    cutting off its supplies of raw materials and spare machine parts, the
    United States Department of Commerce issued on October 19, 1960, an order
    prohibiting the shipment of many products to our island. This ban on trade
    with Cuba was progressively intensified until on February 3, 1962, the late
    President Kennedy placed an embargo on all United States trade with Cuba.
    <p>After all these acts of aggression had failed, the United States went on
    to subject our country to economic blockade with the object of stopping
    trade between other countries and our own. Firstly, on January 24, 1962, the
    United States Treasury Department announced a ban on the importation into
    the United States of any article made wholly or partly from products of
    Cuban origin, even if it was manufactured in another country. A further
    step, equivalent to setting up a virtual economic blockade, was taken on
    February 6, 1963, when the White House issued a communique announcing that
    goods bought with United States Government funds would not be shipped in
    vessels flying the flag of foreign countries which had traded with Cuba
    after January 1, of that year. This was the beginning of the blacklist,
    which now includes over 150 ships belonging to countries that have not
    yielded to the illegal United States blockade. A further measure to obstruct
    Cuba's trade was taken on July 8, 1963, when the United States Treasury
    Department froze all Cuban property in United States territory and
    prohibited the transfer of dollars to or from Cuba, together with other
    kinds of dollar transaction carried out through third countries. Obsessed
    with the desire to attack us, the United States specifically excluded our
    country from the supposed benefits of the Trade Expansion Act. Acts of
    aggression have continued during the current year. On February 18, 1964, the
    United States announced the suspension of its aid to the United Kingdom,
    France, and Yugoslavia, because these countries were still trading with
    Cuba. Secretary of State Dean Rusk said that, &quot;there could be no
    improvement in relations with Communist China while that country incited and
    supported acts of aggression in Southeast Asia, or in relations with Cuba
    while it represented a threat to the Western Hemisphere.&quot; That threat,
    he went on, could be ended to Washington's satisfaction only with the
    overthrow of the Castro regime by the Cuban people. They regarded that
    regime as temporary.
    <p>Cuba summons the delegation of the United States Government to say
    whether the actions foreshadowed by the Secretary's statement and others
    like it, and the incidents we have described are or are not at odds with
    coexistence in the world today, and whether, in the opinion of that
    delegation, the successive acts of economic aggression committed against our
    island and against other countries which trade with us are legitimate. I ask
    whether that attitude is or is not at odds with the principle of the
    organization that brings us together -- that of practicing tolerance between
    states -- and with the obligation laid by that organization upon countries
    that have ratified its Charter to settle their disputes by peaceful means. I
    ask whether that attitude is or is not at odds with the spirit of this
    meeting in favor of abandoning all forms of discrimination and removing the
    barriers between countries with different social systems and at different
    stages of development. And I ask this conference to pass judgement on the
    explanation, if the United States delegation ventures to make one. We, for
    our part, maintain the only position we have ever taken in the matter: We
    are ready to join in discussions provided that no prior conditions are
    imposed.
    <p>The period that has elapsed since the Havana Charter was signed has been
    marked by events of undeniable importance in the field of trade and economic
    development. In the first place we have to note the expansion of the
    socialist camp and the collapse of the colonial system. Many countries,
    covering an area of more than thirty million square kilometres and with
    one-third of the world's population, have chosen as their system of
    development the construction of the communist society, and as their working
    philosophy, Marxism-Leninism. Others, without directly embracing the
    Marxist-Leninist philosophy, have stated their intention of laying the
    foundations on which to build socialism. Europe, Asia, and now Africa and
    America, are continents shaken by the new ideas abroad in the world.
    <p>The countries in the socialist camp have developed uninterruptedly at
    rates of growth much faster than those of the capitalist countries in spite
    of having started out, as a general rule, from fairly low levels of
    development and of having had to withstand wars to the death and rigorous
    blockades.
    <p>In contrast with the surging growth of the countries in the socialist
    camp and the development taking place, albeit much more slowly, in the
    majority of the capitalist countries, is the unquestionable fact that a
    large proportion of the so-called underdeveloped countries are in total
    stagnation, and that in some of them the rate of economic growth is lower
    than that of population increase.
    <p>These characteristics are not fortuitous; they correspond strictly to the
    nature of the developed capitalist system in full expansion, which transfers
    to the dependent countries the most abusive and barefaced forms of
    exploitation.
    <p>Since the end of the last century this aggressive expansionist trend has
    been manifested in countless attacks on various countries on the more
    underdeveloped continents. Today, however, it mainly takes the form of
    control exercised by the developed powers over the production of and trade
    in raw materials in the dependent countries. In general it is shown by the
    dependence of a given country on a single primary commodity, which sells
    only in a specific market in quantities restricted to the needs of that
    market.
    <p>The inflow of capital from the developed countries is the prerequisite
    for the establishment of economic dependence. This inflow takes various
    forms: loans granted on onerous terms; investments that place a given
    country in the power of the investors; almost total technological
    subordination of the dependent country to the developed country; control of
    a country's foreign trade by the big international monopolies; and in
    extreme cases, the use of force as an economic weapon in support of the
    other forms of exploitation.
    <p>Sometimes this inflow takes very subtle forms, such as the use of
    international financial credit and other types of organizations. The
    International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and
    Development, GATT 2 and on the American continent, the Inter-American
    Development Bank are examples of international organizations placed at the
    service of the great capitalist colonialist powers essentially at the
    service of United States imperialism. These organizations make their way
    into domestic economic policy, foreign trade policy, and domestic and
    external financial relations of all kinds.
    <p>The International Monetary Fund is the watchdog of the dollar in the
    capitalist camp; the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
    is the instrument for the infiltration of United States capital into the
    underdeveloped world, and the Inter American Development Bank performs the
    same sorry function on the American continent. All these organizations are
    governed by rules and principles which are represented as safeguards of
    equity and reciprocity in international economic relations, whereas in
    reality they are merely hocus-pocus masking the subtlest kinds of
    instruments for the perpetuation of backwardness and exploitation. The
    International Monetary Fund, which is supposed to watch over the stability
    of exchange rates and the liberalization of international payments, merely
    denies the underdeveloped countries even the slightest means of defense
    against the competition of invading foreign monopolies.
    <p>While launching so-called austerity programs and opposing the forms of
    payment necessary for the expansion of trade between countries faced with a
    balance of payments crisis and suffering from severe discriminatory measures
    in international trade, it strives desperately to save the dollar from its
    precarious situation, without going to the heart of the structural problems
    which afflict the international monetary system and which impede a more
    rapid expansion of world trade.
    <p>GATT, for its part, by establishing equal treatment and reciprocal
    concessions between developed and underdeveloped countries, helps to
    maintain the status quo and serves the interests of the former group of
    countries, and its machinery fails to provide the necessary means for the
    elimination of agricultural protectionism, subsidies, tariffs, and other
    obstacles to the expansion of exports from the dependent countries. Even
    more, it now has its so-called &quot;Programme of Action,&quot; and by a
    rather suspicious coincidence, the &quot;Kennedy Round&quot; is just about
    to begin.
    <p>In order to strengthen imperialist domination, the establishment of
    preferential areas has been adopted as a means of exploitation and
    neocolonial control. We can speak in full knowledge of this, for we
    ourselves have suffered the effects of preferential Cuban-United States
    agreements which shackled our trade and placed it at the disposal of the
    United States monopolies.
    <p>There is no better way to show what those preferences meant for Cuba than
    to quote the views of Sumner Welles, the United States Ambassador, on the
    Reciprocal Trade Agreement which was negotiated in 1933 and signed in 1934:
    &quot;...the Cuban Government in turn would grant us a practical monopoly of
    the Cuban market for American imports, the sole reservation being that in
    view of the fact that Great Britain was Cuba's chief customer for that
    portion of sugar exports which did not go to the United States, the Cuban
    Government would desire to concede certain advantages to a limited category
    of imports from Great Britain.
    <p>&quot;...Finally, the negotiation at this time of a reciprocal trade
    agreement with Cuba, along the lines above indicated, will not only revive
    Cuba but will give us practical control of a market we have been steadily
    losing for the past ten years, not only for our manufactured products but
    for our agricultural exports as well, notably in such categories as wheat,
    animal fats, meat products, rice, and potatoes&quot; [telegram from
    Ambassador Welles to the Secretary of State of the United States, sent on
    May 13, 1933 at 6 PM. and reproduced on pages 289 and 290 of Volume V (1933)
    of the official publication Foreign Relations of the United States]. The
    results of the so-called Reciprocal Trade Agreement confirmed the view of
    Ambassador Welles.
    <p>Cuba had to vend its main product, sugar, all over the world in order to
    obtain foreign currency with which to achieve a balance of payments with the
    United States, and the special tariffs which were imposed prevented
    producers in European countries, as well as our own national producers, from
    competing with those of the United States.
    <p>It is necessary only to quote a few figures to prove that it was Cuba's
    function to seek foreign currency all over the world for the United States.
    During the period 1948 to '957, Cuba had a persistent debit balance of trade
    with the United States, totaling 382.7 million pesos, whereas its trade
    balance with the rest of the world was consistently favorable, totaling
    1,274.6 million pesos. The balance of payments for the period 1948-1958
    tells the story even more eloquently: Cuba had a positive balance of 543.9
    million pesos in its trade with countries other than the United States, but
    lost this to its rich neighbor with which it had a negative balance of 952.1
    million pesos, with the result that its foreign currency reserves were
    reduced by 408.2 million pesos.
    <p>The so-called Alliance for Progress is another clear demonstration of the
    fraudulent methods used by the United States to maintain false hopes among
    nations, while exploitation grows more acute.
    <p>When Fidel Castro, our Prime Minister, indicated at Buenos Aires in 1959,
    that a minimum of 3 billion dollars a year of additional external income was
    needed to finance a rate of development which would really reduce the
    enormous gap separating Latin America from the developed countries, many
    thought that the figure was exaggerated. At Punta del Este, however, 2
    billion dollars a year was promised. Today it is recognized that merely to
    offset the loss caused by the deterioration in the terms of trade in 1961
    (the last year for which figures are available), 30 per cent a year more
    than the hypothetical amount promised will be required. The paradoxical
    situation now is that, while the loans are either not forthcoming or are
    made for projects which contribute little or nothing to the industrial
    development of the region, increased amounts of foreign currency are being
    transferred to the industrialized countries. This means that the wealth
    created by the labor of peoples who live for the most part in conditions of
    backwardness, hunger, and poverty is enjoyed in United States imperialist
    circles. In 1961, for instance, according to ECLA figures, there was an
    outflow of 1.735 billion dollars from Latin America, in the form of interest
    on foreign investments and similar payments, and of 1.456 billion dollars in
    payments on foreign short-term and long-term loans. If we add to this the
    indirect loss of purchasing power of exports (or deterioration in the terms
    of trade), which amounted to 2.66 billion dollars in 1961, and 400 million
    dollars for the flight of capital, we arrive at a total of 6.2 billion
    dollars, or more than three &quot;Alliances for Progress&quot; a year. Thus,
    assuming that the situation has not deteriorated further in 1964, the Latin
    American countries participating in the Alliance for Progress will lose
    directly or indirectly, during the three months of this conference, almost
    1.6 billion dollars of the wealth created by the labor of their peoples. On
    the other hand, of the 2 billion dollars pledged for the entire year, barely
    half can be expected, on an optimistic estimate, to be forthcoming.
    <p>Latin America's experience of the real results of this type of
    &quot;aid,&quot; which is represented as the surest and most effective means
    of increasing external income, better than the direct method-that of
    increasing the volume and value of exports, and modifying their
    structure-has been a lamentable one. For this very reason it may serve as a
    lesson for other regions and for the underdeveloped world in general. At
    present that region is virtually at a standstill so far as growth is
    concerned; it is also afflicted by inflation and unemployment, is caught up
    in the vicious circle of foreign indebtedness, and is racked with tensions
    which are sometimes discharged by armed conflict.
    <p>Cuba has drawn attention to these facts as they emerged, and has
    predicted the outcome, specifying that it rejected any implication in it
    other than that emanation from its example and its moral support; and events
    have proved it to be right. The Second Declaration of Havana is proving its
    historical validity.
    <p>These phenomena, which we have analyzed in relation to Latin America, but
    which are valid for the whole of the dependent world, have the effect of
    enabling the developed powers to maintain trade conditions that lead to a
    deterioration in the terms of trade between the dependent countries and the
    developed countries.
    <p>This aspect -- one of the more obvious ones, which the capitalist
    propaganda machinery has been unable to conceal -- is another of the factors
    that have led to the convening of this conference.
    <p>The deterioration in the terms of trade is quite simple in its practical
    effect: the underdeveloped countries must export raw materials and primary
    commodities in order to import the same amount of industrial goods. The
    problem is particularly serious in the case of the machinery and equipment
    which are essential to agricultural and industrial development.
    <p>We submit a short tabulation, indicating, in physical terms, the amount
    of primary commodities needed to import a thirty to thirty-nine horsepower
    tractor in the years 1955 and 1962. These figures are given merely to
    illustrate the problem we are considering. Obviously, there are some primary
    commodities for which prices have not fallen and may indeed have risen
    somewhat during the same period, and there may be some machinery and
    equipment which have not risen in relative cost as substantially as that in
    our example. What we give here is the general trend.
    <p>We have taken several representative countries as producers of the raw
    materials or primary commodities mentioned. This does not mean, however,
    that they are the only producers of the item or that they produce nothing
    else.
    <p>Many underdeveloped countries, on analyzing their troubles, arrive at
    what seems a logical conclusion. They say that the deterioration in the
    terms of trade is an objective fact and the underlying cause of most of
    their problems and is attributable to the fall in the prices of the raw
    materials which they export and the rise in the prices of manufactures which
    they import -- I refer here to world market prices. They also say, however,
    that if they trade with the socialist countries at the prices prevailing in
    those markets, the latter countries benefit from the existing state of
    affairs because they are generally exporters of manufactures and importers
    of raw materials. In all honesty, we have to recognize that this is the
    case, but we must also recognize that the socialist countries did not cause
    the present situation -- they absorb barely 10 per cent of the
    underdeveloped countries' primary commodity exports to the rest of the world
    -- and that, for historical reasons, they have been compelled to trade under
    the conditions prevailing in the world market, which is the outcome of
    imperialist domination over the internal economy and external markets of the
    dependent countries. This is not the basis on which the socialist countries
    organize their long-term trade with the underdeveloped countries. There are
    many examples to bear this out, including, in particular, Cuba. When our
    social structure changed and our relations with the socialist camp attained
    a new level of mutual trust, we did not cease to be underdeveloped, but we
    established a new type of relationship with the countries in that camp. The
    most striking example of this new relationship are the sugar price
    agreements we have concluded with the Soviet Union, under which that
    fraternal country has undertaken to purchase increasing amounts of our main
    product at fair and stable prices, which have already been agreed up to the
    year 1970.
    <p>Furthermore, we must not forget that there are underdeveloped countries
    in a variety of circumstances and that they maintain a variety of policies
    toward the socialist camp. There are some, like Cuba, which have chosen the
    path of socialism; there are some which are developing in a more or less
    capitalist manner and are beginning to produce manufactures for export;
    there are some which have neocolonial ties; there are some which have a
    virtually feudal structure; and there are others which, unfortunately, do
    not participate in conferences of this type because the developed countries
    have not granted the independence to which their people aspire. Such is the
    case of British Guiana, Puerto Rico, and other countries in Latin America,
    Africa, and Asia. Except in the first of these groups, foreign capital has
    made its way into these countries in one way or another, and the demands
    that are today being directed to the Socialist countries should be placed on
    the correct footing of negotiation. In some cases this means negotiation
    between underdeveloped and developed country; almost always, however, it
    means negotiation between one country subject to discrimination and another
    in the same situation. On many occasions these same countries demand
    unilateral preferential treatment from all the developed countries without
    exception: i.e., including in this category the socialist countries. They
    place all kinds of obstacles in the way of direct trading with these states.
    There is a danger that they may seek to trade through national subsidiaries
    of the imperialist powers-thus giving the latter the chance of spectacular
    profits - by claiming that a given country is underdeveloped and therefore
    entitled to unilateral preferences.
    <p>If we do not want to wreck this conference, we must abide strictly by
    principles. We who speak for underdeveloped countries must stress the right
    on our side; in our case, as a socialist country, we can also speak of the
    discrimination that is practiced against us, not only by some developed
    capitalist countries but also by underdeveloped countries, which consciously
    or otherwise, are serving the interests of the monopoly capital that has
    taken over basic control of their economy.
    <p>We do not regard the existing terms of world trade as just, but this is
    not the only injustice that exists. There is direct expolitation of some
    countries by others; there is discrimination among countries by reason of
    differences in economic structure; and, as we already pointed out, there is
    the invasion of foreign capital to the point where it controls a country's
    economy for its own ends. To be logical, when we address requests to the
    developed socialist countries, we should also specify what we are going to
    do to end discrimination and at least specify the most obvious and dangerous
    forms of imperialist penetration.
    <p>We all know about the trade discrimination practiced by the leading
    imperialist countries against the socialist countries with the object of
    hampering their development. At times it has been tantamount to a real
    blockade, such as the almost absolute blockade maintained by United States
    imperialism against the German Democratic Republic, the People's Republic of
    China, the Democratic Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam,
    and the Republic of Cuba. Everyone knows that that policy has failed, and
    that other powers which originally followed the lead of the United States
    have gradually parted company from it in order to secure their own profits.
    The failure of this policy is by now only too obvious.
    <p>Trade discrimination has also been practiced against dependent and
    socialist countries, the ultimate object being to ensure that the monopolies
    do not lose their sphere of exploitation and at the same time to strengthen
    the blockade of the socialist camp. This policy, too, is failing, and the
    question arises whether there is any point in remaining bound to foreign
    interests which history has condemned, or whether the time has come to break
    through all the obstacles to trade and expand markets in the socialist area.
    <p>The various forms of discrimination which hamper trade, and which make it
    easier for the imperialists to manipulate a range of primary commodities and
    a number of countries producing those commodities, are still being
    maintained. In the atomic era it is simply absurd to classify such products
    as copper and other minerals as strategic materials and to obstruct trade in
    them; yet this policy has been maintained, and is being maintained to this
    day. There is also talk of so-called incompatibilities between state
    monopoly of foreign trade and the forms of trading adopted by the capitalist
    countries; and on that pretext discriminatory relations, quotas, etc., are
    established -- maneuvers in which GATT has played a dominant role under the
    official guise of combating unfair trade practices. Discrimination against
    state trading not only serves as a weapon against the socialist countries
    but is also designed to prevent the underdeveloped countries from adopting
    any of the most urgent measures needed to strengthen their negotiating
    position on the international market and to counteract the operations of the
    monopolies.
    <p>The suspension of economic aid by international agencies to countries
    adopting the socialist system of government is a further variation on the
    same theme. For the International Monetary Fund to attack bilateral payments
    agreements with socialist countries and impose on its weaker members a
    policy of opposition to this type of relations between peoples has been a
    common practice in recent years.
    <p>As we have already pointed out, all these discriminatory measures im
    posed by imperialism have the dual object of blockading the socialist camp
    and strengthening the exploitation of the underdeveloped countries.
    <p>It is incontrovertible that present-day prices are unfair; it is equally
    true that prices are conditioned by monopolist limitation of markets and by
    the establishment of political relationships that make free competition a
    term of one-sided application; free competition for the monopolies; a free
    fox among free chickens! Quite apart from such agreements as may emanate
    from this conference, the opening up of the large and growing markets of the
    socialist camp would help to raise the prices of raw materials. The world is
    hungry but lacks the money to buy food; and paradoxically, in the
    underdeveloped world, in the world of the hungry, possible ways of expanding
    food production are discouraged in order to keep prices up, in order to be
    able to eat. This is the inexorable law of the philosophy of plunder, which
    must cease to be the rule in relations between peoples.
    <p>Furthermore it would be feasible for some underdeveloped countries to
    export manufactured goods to the socialist countries, and even for long-term
    agreements to be concluded so as to enable some nations to make better use
    of their natural wealth and specialize in certain branches of industry that
    would enable them to participate in world trade as manufacturing countries.
    All this can be supplemented by the provision of long-term credits for the
    development of the industries, or branches of industry, we are considering;
    it must always be borne in mind, however, that certain measures in respect
    to relations between socialist countries and underdeveloped countries cannot
    be taken unilaterally.
    <p>It is a strange paradox that, while the United Nations is forecasting in
    its reports adverse trends in the foreign trade of the underdeveloped
    countries, and while Mr. Prebisch, the secretary-general of the conference,
    is stressing the dangers that will arise if this state of affairs persists,
    there is still talk of the feasibility -- and in some cases, such as that of
    the so-called strategic materials, the necessity -- of discriminating
    against certain states because they belong to the socialist countries' camp.
    <p>All these anomalies are possible because of the incontrovertible fact
    that, at the present stage of human history, the underdeveloped countries
    are the battleground of economic systems that belong in different eras. In
    some of these countries, feudalism still exists; in others a nascent, still
    weak bourgeoisie has to stand the dual pressure of imperialist interests and
    of its own proletariat, who are fighting for a fairer distribution of
    income. In the face of this dilemma a certain section of the national
    bourgeoisie in some countries have maintained their independence or have
    found a certain form of common action with the proletariat, while the other
    part has made common cause with imperialism; they have become its
    appendages, its agents, and have imparted the same character to the
    governments representing them.
    <p>We must sound a warning that this type of dependence, skillfully used,
    may endanger the achievement of solid progress at the conference; but we
    must also point out that such advantages as these governments may gain
    today, as the price of disunity, will be repaid with interest tomorrow, when
    in addition to facing the hostility of their own peoples, they will have to
    stand up alone to the monopolist offensive whose only law is maximum gain.
    <p>We have made a brief analysis of the causes and results of the
    contradictions between the socialist camp and the imperialist camp and
    between the camp of the exploited and that of the exploiting countries; here
    are two clear and present dangers to the peace of the world. It must also be
    pointed out, however, that the growing boom in some capitalist countries,
    and their inevitable expansion in search of new markets, have led to changes
    in the balance of forces among them and set up stresses that will need
    careful attention if world peace is to be preserved. It should not be
    forgotten that the last two world conflagrations were sparked off by clashes
    between developed powers that found force to be the only way out. On every
    hand we observe a series of phenomena which demonstrate the growing
    acuteness of this struggle.
    <p>This situation may involve real dangers to world peace in time to come,
    but now, today, it is exceedingly dangerous to the smooth progress of this
    very conference. There is a clear distribution of spheres of influence
    between the United States and other developed capitalist powers, embracing
    the underdeveloped continents, and in some cases, Europe as well. If these
    influences grow so strong as to turn the exploited countries into a field of
    battle waged for the benefit of the imperialist powers, the conference will
    have failed.
    <p>Cuba considers that, as is pointed out in the joint statement of the
    underdeveloped countries, the trade problems of our countries are well known
    and what is needed is that clear principles be adopted and practical action
    taken to usher in a new era for the world. We also consider that the
    statement of principles submitted by the U.S.S.R. and other socialist
    countries forms the right basis on which to start discussion, and we endorse
    it fully. Our country also supports the measures formulated at the meeting
    of experts at Brasilia, which would give coherence to the principles we
    advocate, and which we shall go on to expound.
    <p>Cuba wishes to make one point clear at the outset: We must not come here
    to plead for aid, but to demand justice; but not a justice subject to the
    fallacious interpretations we have so often seen prevail at international
    meetings; a justice which, even though the peoples cannot define it in legal
    terms but the desire for which is deeply rooted in spirits oppressed by
    generations of exploitation.
    <p>Cuba affirms that this conference must produce a definition of
    international trade as an appropriate tool for the speedier economic
    development of the underdeveloped peoples and of those subjected to
    discrimination, and that this definition must make for the elimination of
    all forms of discrimination and all differences, even those emanating from
    allegedly equal treatment. Treatment must be equitable, and equity, in this
    context, is not equality; equity is the inequality needed to enable the
    exploited peoples to attain an acceptable standard of living. Our task here
    is to lay a foundation on which a new international division of labor can be
    instituted by making full use of a country's entire natural resources and by
    raising the degree of processing of those resources until the most complex
    forms of manufacture can be undertaken.
    <p>In addition the new division of labor must be approached by restoring to
    the underdeveloped countries the traditional export markets that have been
    snatched from them by artificial measures for the protection and
    encouragement of production in the developed countries; and the
    underdeveloped countries must be given a fair share of future increases in
    consumption.
    <p>The conference will have to recommend specific methods of regulating the
    use of primary commodity surpluses so as to prevent their conversion into a
    form of subsidy for the exports of developed countries to the detriment of
    the traditional exports of the underdeveloped countries, or their use as an
    instrument for the injection of foreign capital into an under-developed
    country.
    <p>It is inconceivable that the underdeveloped countries, which are
    sustaining the vast losses inflicted by the deterioration in the terms of
    trade and which, through the steady drain of interest payments, have richly
    repaid the imperialist powers for the value of their investments, should
    have to bear the growing burden of indebtedness and repayment, while even
    more rightful demands go unheeded. The Cuban delegation proposes that, until
    such time as the prices for the underdeveloped countries' exports reach a
    level which will reimburse them for the losses sustained over the past
    decade, all payments of dividends, interest, and amortization should be
    suspended.
    <p>It must be made crystal clear that foreign capital investment dominating
    any country's economy, the deterioration in terms of trade, the control of
    one country's markets by another, discriminatory relations, and the use of
    force as an instrument of persuasion, are a danger to world trade and world
    peace.
    <p>This conference must also establish in plain terms the right of all
    peoples to unrestricted freedom of trade, and the obligation of all states
    signatories of the agreement emanating from the conference to refrain from
    restraining trade in any manner, direct or indirect.
    <p>The right of all countries freely to arrange the shipment of their goods
    by sea or air and to move them freely throughout the world without let or
    hindrance will be clearly laid down.
    <p>The application of economic measures, or the incitement to apply economic
    measures, used by a state to infringe the sovereign freedom of another state
    and to obtain from it advantages of any nature whatsoever, or to bring about
    the collapse of its economy, must be condemned.
    <p>In order to achieve the foregoing, the principle of self-determination
    embodied in the Charter of the United Nations must be fully implemented and
    the right of states to dispose of their own resources, to adopt the form of
    political and economic organization that suits them best, and to choose
    their own lines of development and specialization in economic activity,
    without incurring reprisals of any kind whatsoever, must be reaffirmed.
    <p>The conference must adopt measures for the establishment of financial,
    credit, and tariff bodies, whose rules are based on absolute equality and on
    justice and equity, to take the place of the existing bodies, which are out
    of date from the functional point of view and reprehensible from the
    stand-point of specific aims.
    <p>In order to guarantee to a people the full disposal of their resources,
    it is necessary to condemn the existence of foreign bases, the presence,
    temporary or otherwise, of foreign troops in a country without its consent,
    and the maintenance of colonialism by a few developed capitalist powers.
    <p>For all these purposes the conference must reach agreement and lay a firm
    foundation for the establishment of an International Trade Organization, to
    be governed by the principle of the equality and universality of its
    members, and to possess sufficient authority to take decisions binding on
    all signatory states, abolishing the practice of barring such forums to
    countries which have won their liberation since the establishment of the
    United Nations and whose social systems are not to the liking of some of the
    mighty ones of this world.
    <p>Only the establishment of an organization of the type mentioned, to take
    the place of existing bodies that are mere props for the status quo and for
    discrimination, and not compromise formulae, which merely enable us to talk
    ourselves to a standstill about what we already know, will guarantee
    compliance with new rules of international relations and the attainment of
    the desired economic security.
    <p>At all relevant points, exact time-limits must be laid down for the
    completion of the measures decided upon.
    <p>These, gentlemen, are the most important points which the Cuban
    delegation wished to bring to your attention. It should be pointed out that
    many of the ideas which are now gaining currency upon being expressed by
    international bodies, in the precise analysis of the present situation of
    the developing countries submitted by Mr. Prebisch, the secretary-general of
    the conference, and many of the measures approved by other states -- trading
    with socialist countries, obtaining credits from them, the need of basic
    social reforms for economic development, etc. -- have been formulated and
    put into practice by Cuba during the revolutionary government's five years
    in office, and have exposed it to unjust censure and acts of economic and
    military aggression approved by some of the countries which now endorse
    those ideas.
    <p>Suffice it to recall the criticism and censure aimed at Cuba for having
    established trade relations and cooperation with countries outside our
    hemishpere, and its de facto exclusion, to this day, from the Latin American
    regional group which meets under the auspices of the Charter of Alta Gracia,
    namely the Organization of American States, from which Cuba is barred.
    <p>We have dealt with the basic points concerning foreign trade, the need
    for changes in the foreign policy of the developed countries in their
    relations with the underdeveloped countries, and the need to reconstruct all
    international credit, financial and similar bodies; but it must be
    emphasized that these measures are not sufficient to guarantee economic
    development, and that other measures -- which Cuba, an underdeveloped
    country, has put into practice -- are needed as well. As a minimum, exchange
    control must be established, prohibiting remittances of funds abroad or
    restricting them to an appreciable degree; there must be state control of
    foreign trade, and land reform; all natural resources must be returned to
    the nation; and technical education must be encouraged, together with other
    measures of internal reorganization which are essential to a faster rate of
    development.
    <p>Out of respect for the wishes of the governments represented here, Cuba
    has not included among the irreducible minimum measures the taking over by
    the state of all the means of production, but it considers that this measure
    would contribute to a more efficient and swifter solution to the serious
    problems under discussion.
    <p>And the imperialists? Will they sit with their arms crossed? No!
    <p>The system they practice is the cause of the evils from which we are
    suffering, but they will try to obscure the facts with spurious allegations,
    of which they are masters. They will try to compromise the conference and
    sow disunity in the camp of the exploited countries by offering them
    pittances.
    <p>They will try everything in an endeavor to keep in force the old
    international bodies which serve their ends so well, and will offer reforms
    lacking in depth. They will seek a way to lead the conference into a blind
    alley, so that it will be suspended or adjourned; they will try to rob it of
    importance by comparison with other meetings convened by themselves, or to
    see that it ends without achieving any tangible results.
    <p>They will not accept a new international trade organization; they will
    threaten to boycott it, and will probably do so.
    <p>They will try to show that the existing international division of labor
    is beneficial to all, and will refer to industrialization as a dangerous and
    excessive ambition.
    <p>Lastly, they will allege that the blame for underdevelopment rests with
    the underdeveloped.
    <p>To this we can reply that to a certain extent they are right, and they
    will be all the more so if we show ourselves incapable of joining together,
    in wholehearted determination, in a united front of victims of
    discrimination and exploitation.
    <p>The questions we wish to ask this assembly are these: Shall we be able to
    carry out the task history demands of us? Will the developed capitalist
    countries have the political acumen to accede to minimum demands?
    <p>If the measures here indicated cannot be adopted by this conference, and
    all that emerges once again is a hybrid document crammed with vague
    statements and escape clauses; and unless, at the very least, the economic
    and political barriers to trade among all regions of the world, and to
    international cooperation, are removed, the underdeveloped countries will
    continue to face increasingly difficult economic situations and world
    tension could mount dangerously. A world conflagration could be sparked off
    at any moment by the ambition of some imperialist country to destroy the
    socialist countries' camp, or in the not too distant future, by intractable
    contradictions between the capitalist countries. In addition, however, the
    feeling of revolt will grow stronger every day among the peoples subjected
    to various degrees of exploitation, and they will take up arms to gain by
    force the rights which reason alone has not won them.
    <p>This is happening today among the peoples of so-called Portuguese Guinea
    and Angola, who are fighting to free themselves from the colonial yoke, and
    with the people of South Vietnam who, weapons in hand, stand ready to shake
    off the yoke of imperialism and its puppets.
    <p>Let it he known that Cuba supports and applauds those people who, having
    exhausted all possibilities of a peaceful solution, have called a halt to
    exploitation, and that their magnificent defiance has won our militant
    solidarity. Having stated the essential points on which our analysis of the
    present situation is based, having put forward the recommendations we
    consider pertinent to this conference, and our views on what the future
    holds if no progress is made in trade relations between countries -- an
    appropriate means of reducing tension and contributing to development -- we
    wish to place on record our hope that the constructive discussion we spoke
    of will take place.
    <p>The aim of our efforts is to bring about a discussion from which everyone
    will gain and to rally the underdeveloped countries of the world to unity,
    so as to present a cohesive front. We place our hopes also in the success of
    this conference, and join our hopes, in friendship, to those of the world's
    poor, and to the countries in the socialist camp, putting all our meager
    powers to work for its success.
