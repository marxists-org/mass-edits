    <p>The Cuban delegation to this assembly has
    pleasure, first of all, in fulfilling the pleasant duty of welcoming three
    new nations to the large number of nations whose representatives are
    discussing the problems of the world. We therefore greet through their
    Presidents and Prime Ministers the people of Zambia, Malawi, and Malta, and
    express the hope that from the outset these countries will be added to the
    group of non-aligned countries which struggle against imperialism,
    colonialism, and neocolonialism.</p>
    <p>We also wish to convey our congratulations to the President of this
    assembly whose elevation to so high a post is of special significance since
    it reflects this new historic stage of resounding triumphs for the peoples
    of Africa, until recently subject to the colonial system of imperialism, and
    who, today, for the great part in the legitimate exercise of
    self-determination, have become citizens of sovereign states. The last hour
    of colonialism has struck, and millions of inhabitants of Africa, Asia, and
    Latin American rise to meet a new life, and assert their unrestricted right
    to self-determination and to the independent development of their nations.
    <p>We wish you, Mr President, the greatest success in the tasks entrusted to
    you by member states.
    <p>Cuba comes here to state its position on the most important controversial
    issues and will do so with the full sense of responsibility which the use of
    this rostrum implies, while at the same time responding to the unavoidable
    duty of speaking out, clearly and frankly.
    <p>We should like to see this assembly shake itself out of complacency and
    move forward. We should like to see the committees begin their work and not
    stop at the first confrontation. Imperialism wishes to convert this meeting
    into an aimless oratorical tournament, instead of using it to solve the
    grave problems of the world. We must prevent their doing so. This assembly
    should not be remembered in the future only by the number nineteen which
    identifies it. We feel that we have the right and the obligation to try to
    make this meeting effective because our country is a constant point of
    friction; one of the places where the principles supporting the rights of
    small nations to sovereignty are tested day by day, minute by minute; and at
    the same time our country is one of the barricades of freedom in the world,
    situated a few steps away from United States imperialism, to show with its
    actions, its daily example, that peoples can liberate themselves, can keep
    themselves free, in the existing conditions of the world.
    <p>Of course, there is now a socialist camp which becomes stronger day by
    day and has more powerful weapons of struggle. But additional conditions are
    required for survival: the maintenance of internal cohesion, faith in one's
    destiny, and the irreversible decision to fight to the death for the defense
    of one's country and revolution. These conditions exist in Cuba.
    <p>Of all the burning problems to be dealt with by this assembly, one which
    has special significance for us and whose solution we feel must be sought
    first, so as to leave no doubt in the minds of anyone, is that of peaceful
    coexistence among states with different economic and social Systems. Much
    progress has been made in the world in this field. But imperialism,
    particularly United States imperialism, has tried to make the world believe
    that peaceful coexistence is the exclusive right of the great powers on
    earth. We repeat what our President said in Cairo, and which later took
    shape in the Declaration of the Second Conference of Heads of State or
    Government of Non-Aligned Countries: that there cannot be peaceful
    coexistence only among the powerful if we are to ensure world peace.
    Peaceful coexistence must be practiced by all states, independent of size,
    of the previous historic relations that linked them, and of the problems
    that may arise among some of them at a given moment.&quot;
    <p>At present the type of peaceful coexistence to which we aspire does not
    exist in many cases. The kingdom of Cambodia, merely because it maintained a
    neutral attitude and did not submit to the machinations of United States
    imperialism, has been subjected to all kinds of treacherous and brutal
    attacks from the Yankee bases in South Vietnam.
    <p>Laos, a divided country, has also been the object of imperialist
    aggression of every kind. The conventions concluded at Geneva have been
    violated, its peoples have been massacred from the air, and part of its
    territory is in constant danger from cowardly attacks by imperialist forces.
    <p>The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which knows of the histories of
    aggressions as few people on earth, once again bas seen its frontier
    violated, its installations attacked by enemy bomber and fighter planes, its
    naval posts attacked by the United States warships violating territorial
    waters.
    <p>At this moment, there hangs over the Democratic Republic of Vietnam the
    threat that the United States warmongers may openly extend to its territory
    the war that, for many years, they have been waging against the people of
    South Vietnam.
    <p>The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have given serious
    warning to the United States. Not only the peace of the world is in danger
    in this situation, but also the lives of millions of human beings in this
    part of Asia are being constantly threatened and subjected to the whim of
    the United States invader.
    <p>Peaceful coexistence has also been put to the test in a brutal manner in
    Cyprus, due to pressures from the Turkish Government and NATO, compelling
    the people and the government of Cyprus to make a firm and heroic stand in
    defense of their sovereignty.
    <p>In all these parts of the world imperialism attempts to impose its
    version of what coexistence should be. It is the oppressed peoples in
    alliance with the socialist camp which must show them the meaning of true
    coexistence, and it is the obligation of the United Nations to support them.
    <p>We must also say that it is not only in relations between sovereign
    states that the concept of peaceful coexistence must be clearly defined. As
    Marxists we have maintained that peaceful coexistence among nations does not
    encompass coexistence between the exploiters and the exploited, the
    oppressor and the oppressed.
    <p>Furthermore, a principle proclaimed by this Organization is that of the
    right to full independence of all forms of colonial oppression. That is why
    we express our solidarity with the colonial peoples of so-called Portuguese
    Guinea, Angola, and Mozambique, who have been massacred for the crime of
    demanding their freedom, and we are prepared to help them to the extent of
    our ability in accordance with the Cairo Declaration.
    <p>We express our solidarity with the people of Puerto Rico and its great
    leader, Pedro Albizu Campos, who has been set free in another act of
    hypocrisy, at the age of seventy-two, after spending a lifetime in jail, now
    paralytic and almost without the ability to speak. Albizu Campos is a symbol
    of the still unredeemed but indomitable America. Years and years of prison,
    almost unbearable pressures in jail, mental torture, solitude, total
    isolation from his people and his family, the insolence of the conqueror and
    lackeys in the land of his birth &mdash; nothing at all broke his will. The
    delegation of Cuba, on behalf of its people, pays a tribute of admiration
    and gratitude to a patriot who bestows honor upon America.
    <p>The North Americans, for many years, have tried to convert Puerto Rico
    into a reflection of hybrid culture &mdash; the Spanish language with an English
    inflection, the Spanish language with hinges on its backbone, the better to
    bend before the United States soldier. Puerto Rican soldiers have been used
    as cannon-fodder in imperialist wars, as in Korea, and even been made to
    fire at their own brothers, as in the massacre perpetrated by the United
    States Army a few months ago against the helpless people of Panamane of the
    most recent diabolical acts carried out by Yankee imperialism. Yet despite
    that terrible attack against its will and its historic destiny, the people
    of Puerto Rico have preserved their culture, their Latin character, their
    national feelings, which in themselves give proof of the implacable will for
    independence that exists among the masses on the Latin American island.
    <p>We must also point out that the principle of peaceful coexistence does
    not imply a mockery of the will of the peoples, as is happening in the case
    of so-called British Guiana, where the government of Prime Minister Cheddi
    Jagan has been the victim of every kind of pressure and maneuver, while the
    achievement of independence has been delayed by the search for methods that
    would allow for the flouting of the will of the people while ensuring the
    docility of a Government different from the present one, put in by
    underhanded tactics, and then to grant an important &quot;freedom&quot; to
    this piece of American soil. Whatever roads Guiana may be compelled to
    follow to obtain independence, the moral and militant support of Cuba goes
    to its people.
    <p>Furthermore, we must point out that the islands of Guadaloupe and
    Martinique have been fighting for a long time for their autonomy without
    obtaining it. This state of affairs must not continue.
    <p>Once again we raise our voice to put the world on guard against what is
    happening in South Africa. The brutal policy of apartheid is being carried
    out before the eyes of the whole world. The peoples of Africa are being
    compelled to tolerate in that continent the concept, still official, of the
    superiority of one race over another and in the name of that racial
    superiority the murder of people with impunity. Can the United Nations do
    nothing to prevent this? I should like specifically to refer to the painful
    case of the Congo, unique in the history of the modern world, which shows
    how, with absolute impunity, with the most insolent cynicism, the rights of
    peoples can be flouted. The prodigious wealth of the Congo, which the
    imperialist nations wish to maintain under their control, is the direct
    reason for this. In his speech on his first visit to the United Nations, our
    comrade Fidel Castro said that the whole problem of coexistence among
    peoples was reduced to the undue appropriation of another's wealth. He said,
    &quot;When this philosophy of despoilment disappears, the philosophy of war
    will have disappeared.&quot;
    <p>The philosophy of despoilment not only has not ceased, but rather it is
    stronger than ever, and that is why those who used the name of the United
    Nations to commit the murder of Lumumba, today, in the name of the defense
    of the white race, are assassinating thousands of Congolese. How can one
    forget how the hope that Patrice Lumumba placed in the United Nations was
    betrayed? How can one forget the machinations and maneuvers which followed
    in the wake of the occupation of that country by United Nations troops under
    whose auspices the assassins of this great African patriot acted with
    impunity? How can we forget that he who flouted the authority of the United
    Nations in the Congo, and not exactly for patriotic reasons, but rather by
    virtue of conflicts between imperialists, was Moise Tshombe, who initiated
    the secession in Katanga with Belgian support? And how can one justify, how
    can one explain, that at the end of all the United Nations activities there,
    Tshombe, dislodged from Katanga, returned as lord and master of the Congo?
    Who can deny the abject role that the imperialists compelled the United
    Nations to play?
    <p>To sum up, dramatic mobilizations were made to avoid the secession of
    Katanga, but today that same Katanga is in power! The wealth of the Congo is
    in imperialist hands and the expenses must be paid by honest nations. The
    merchants of war certainly do good business. That is why the government of
    Cuba supports the just attitude of the Soviet Union in refusing to pay the
    expenses of this crime.
    <p>And as if this were not enough, we now have flung in our faces recent
    events which have filled the world with horror and indignation. Who are the
    perpetrators? Belgian paratroopers transported by United States planes, who
    took off from British bases. We remember as if it were yesterday that we saw
    a small country in Europe, a civilized and industrious country, the kingdom
    of Belgium, invaded by the hordes of Hitler. We learned with bitterness that
    these people were being massacred by the German imperialists, and our
    sympathy and affection went out to them. But the other side of the
    imperialist coin many did not then perceive. Perhaps the sons of Belgian
    patriots who died defending their country are now assassinating thousands of
    Congolese in the name of the white race, just as they suffered under the
    German heel because their blood was not purely Aryan. But the scales have
    fallen from our eyes and they now open upon new horizons, and we can see
    what yesterday, in our conditions of colonial servitude, we could not
    observe - that &quot;Western civilization&quot; disguises under its showy
    front a scene of hyenas and jackals. That is the only name that can be
    applied to those who have gone to fulfill &quot;humanitarian&quot; tasks in
    the Congo. Bloodthirsty butchers who feed on helpless people! That is what
    imperialism does to men; that is what marks the &quot;white&quot;
    imperialists.
    <p>The free men of the world must be prepared to avenge the crime committed
    in the Congo. It is possible that many of those soldiers who were converted
    into &quot;supermen&quot; by imperialist machinery, believe in good faith
    that they are defending the rights of a superior race, but in this assembly
    those peoples whose skins are darkened by a different sun, colored by
    different pigments, constitute the majority, and they fully and clearly
    understand that the difference between men does not lie in the color of
    their skins, but in the ownership of the means of production and in the
    relationship of production.
    <p>The Cuban delegation extends greetings to the peoples of Southern
    Rhodesia and Southwest Africa, oppressed by white colonialist minorities, to
    the peoples of Basutoland, Bechuanaland, Swaziland, French Somaliland, the
    Arabs of Palestine, Aden, and the Protectorates, Oman, and to all peoples in
    conflict with imperialism and colonialism; and we reaffirm our support.
    <p>I express also the hope that there will be a just solution to the
    conflict facing our sister republic of Indonesia in its relations with
    Malaysia.
    <p>One of the essential items before this conference is general and complete
    disarmament. We express our support of general and complete disarmament.
    Furthermore, we advocate the complete destruction of thermonuclear devices
    and the holding of a conference of all the nations of the world toward the
    fulfillment of this aspiration of all people. In his statement before this
    assembly, our Prime Minister said that arms races have always led to war.
    There are new atomic powers in the world, and the possibilities of a
    confrontation are grave.
    <p>We feel that a conference is necessary to obtain the total destruction of
    thermonuclear weapons and as a first step, the total prohibition of tests.
    At the same time there must be clearly established the obligation of all
    states to respect the present frontiers of other states and to refrain from
    indulging in any aggression even with conventional weapons.
    <p>In adding our voice to that of all peoples of the world who plead for
    general and complete disarmament, the destruction of all atomic arsenals,
    the complete cessation of thermonuclear devices and atomic tests of any
    kinds, we feel it necessary to stress, furthermore, that the territorial
    integrity of nations must be respected and the armed hand of imperialism, no
    less dangerous with conventional weapons, must be held back. Those who
    murdered thousands of defenseless citizens in the Congo did not use the
    atomic weapons. They used conventional weapons, and it was these
    conventional weapons, used by imperialists, which caused so many deaths.
    <p>Even if the measures advocated here were to become effective, thus making
    it unnecessary to say the following, we must still point out that we cannot
    adhere to any regional pact for denuclearization so long as the United
    States maintains aggressive bases on our territory, in Puerto Rico and in
    Panama, and in other American states where it feels it has the right to
    station them without any restrictions on conventional or nuclear weapons.
    <p>However, we feel we must be able to provide for our own defense in the
    light of the recent resolution of the Organization of American States
    against Cuba, which on the basis of the Treaty of Rio might permit
    aggression.
    <p>If such a conference to which we have just referred should achieve all
    these objectives &mdash; which unfortunately, would be rather difficult to do &#151;
    it would be one of the most important developments in the history of
    mankind. To ensure this, the People's Republic of China must be represented,
    and that is why such a conference must be held. But it would be much simpler
    for the peoples of the world to recognize the undeniable truth that the
    People's Republic of China exists, that its rulers are the only
    representatives of the Chinese people, and to give it the place it deserves,
    which is, at present, usurped by a clique who control the province of Taiwan
    with United States aid.
    <p>The problem of the representation of China in the United Nations cannot,
    in any way, be considered as a case of a new admission to the organization,
    but rather as the restitution of their legitimate rights to the people of
    the People's Republic of China.
    <p>We repudiate strongly the concept of &quot;two Chinas.&quot; The Chiang
    Kai-shek clique of Taiwan cannot remain in the United Nations. It must be
    expelled and the legitimate representative of the Chinese people put in.
    <p>We warn, also, against the insistence of the United States Government on
    presenting the problem of the legitimate representation of China in the
    United Nations as an &quot;important question&quot; so as to require a
    two-thirds majority of members present and voting.
    <p>The admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations is,
    in fact, an important question for the entire world, but not for the
    mechanics of the United Nations where it must constitute a mere question of
    procedure.
    <p>Thus will justice be done, but almost as important as attaining justice
    would be the fact that it would be demonstrated, once and for all, that this
    august Assembly uses its eyes to see with, its ears to hear with, and its
    tongue to speak with; and has definite standards in making its decisions.
    <p>The proliferation of atomic weapons among the member States of NATO, and
    especially the possession of these devices of mass destruction by the
    Federal Republic of Germany, would make the possibility of an agreement on
    disarmament even more remote, and linked to such an agreement is the problem
    of the peaceful reunification of Germany. So long as there is no clear
    understanding, the existence of two Germanies must be recognized: that of
    the Democratic Republic of Germany and the Federal Republic. The German
    problem can only be solved with the direct participation of the Democratic
    Republic of Germany with full rights in negotiations.
    <p>We shall touch lightly on the questions of economic development and
    international trade which take up a good part of the agenda. In this year,
    1964, the Conference of Geneva was held, where a multitude of matters
    related to these aspects of international relations was dealt with. The
    warnings and forecasts of our delegation were clearly confirmed to the
    misfortune of the economically dependent countries.
    <p>We wish only to point out that insofar as Cuba is concerned, the United
    States of America has not implemented the explicit recommendations of that
    conference, and recently the United States Government also prohibited the
    sale of medicine to Cuba, thus divesting itself once and for all, of the
    mask of humanitarianism with which it attempted to disguise the aggressive
    nature of its blockade against the people of Cuba.
    <p>Furthermore, we once more state that these colonial machinations, which
    impede the development of the peoples, are not only expressed in political
    relations. The so-called deterioration of the terms of trade is nothing less
    than the result of the unequal exchange between countries producing raw
    materials and industrial countries which dominate markets and impose a false
    justice on an inequitable exchange of values.
    <p>So long as the economically dependent peoples do not free themselves from
    the capitalist markets, and as a bloc with the socialist countries, impose
    new terms of trade between the exploited and the exploiters, there will be
    no sound economic development, and in certain cases there will be
    retrogression, in which the weak countries will fall under the political
    domination of imperialists and colonialists.
    <p>Finally, it must be made clear that in the area of the Caribbean,
    maneuvers and preparations for aggression against Cuba are taking place; off
    the coast of Nicaragua above all, in Costa Rica, in the Panama Canal Zone,
    in the Vieques Islands of Puerto Rico, in Florida, and possibly in other
    parts of the territory of the United States, and also, perhaps, in Honduras,
    Cuban mercenaries are training, as well as mercenaries of other
    nationalities, with a purpose that cannot be peaceful.
    <p>After an open scandal, the government of Costa Rica, it is said, has
    ordered the elimination of all training fields for Cuban exiles in that
    country. No one knows whether this attitude is sincere, or whether it it
    simply a maneuver, because the mercenaries training there were about to
    commit some offense. We hope that full cognizance will be taken of the
    actual existence of those bases for aggression, which we denounced long ago,
    and that the world will think about the international responsibility of the
    government of a country which authorizes and facilitates the training of
    mercenaries to attack Cuba.
    <p>We must point out that news of the training of mercenaries at different
    places in the Caribbean and the participation of the United States
    Government in such acts is news that appears openly in United States
    newspapers. We know of no Latin American voice that has been lifted
    officially in protest against this. This shows the cynicism with which the
    United States moves its pawns.
    <p>The shrewd foreign ministers of the OAS had eyes to &quot;see&quot; Cuban
    emblems and find &quot;irrefutable proof&quot; in the Yankee weapons in
    Venezuela, but do not see the preparations for aggression in the United
    States, just as they did not hear the voice of President Kennedy, who
    explicitly declared himself to be the aggressor against Cuba at Playa Giron.
    In some cases it is a blindness provoked by the hatred of the ruling classes
    of the Latin American people against our revolution; in others, and these
    are even more deplorable, it is the result of the blinding light of Mammon.
    <p>As everyone knows, after the terrible upheaval called the &quot;Caribbean
    crisis,&quot; the United States undertook certain given commitments with the
    Soviet Union which culminated in the withdrawal of certain types of weapons
    that the continued aggressions of that country &mdash; such as the mercenary
    attack against Playa Giron and threats of invasion against our country &mdash;
    had compelled us to install in Cuba as a legitimate act of defense.
    <p>The Americans claimed, furthermore, that the United Nations should
    inspect our territory, which we refused and refuse emphatically since Cuba
    does not recognize the right of the United States, or of anyone else in the
    world, to determine what type of weapons Cuba may maintain within its
    borders.
    <p>In this connection, we would only abide by multilateral agreements, with
    equal obligations for all the parties concerned. Fidel Castro declared that
    &quot;so long as the concept of sovereignty exists as the prerogative of
    nations and of independent peoples, and as a right of all peoples, we shall
    not accept the exclusion of our people from that right; so long as the world
    is governed by these principles, so long as the world is governed by those
    concepts which have universal validity because they are universally accepted
    by peoples, we shall not accept the attempt to deprive us of any of those
    rights and we shall renounce none of those rights.&quot;
    <p>The Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, understood our
    reasons. Nevertheless, the United States presumed to establish a new
    prerogative, an arbitrary and illegal one; that of violating the air space
    of any small country. Thus, we see flying over our country U-2 aircraft and
    other types of espionage apparatus which fly over our airspace with
    impunity. We have issued all the necessary warnings for the cessation of the
    violation of our airspace as well as the provocations of the American navy
    against our sentry posts in the zone of Guantanamo, the &quot;buzzing&quot;
    by aircraft over our ships or ships of other nationalities in international
    waters, the piratical attacks against ships sailing under different flags,
    and the infiltration of spies, saboteurs and weapons in our island.
    <p>We want to build socialism; we have declared ourselves partisans of those
    who strive for peace; we have declared ourselves as falling within the group
    of non-aligned countries, although we are Marxist-Leninists, because the
    non-aligned countries, like ourselves, fight imperialism. We want peace; we
    want to build a better life for our people, and that is why we avoid
    answering, so far as possible, the planned provocations of the Yankee. But
    we know the mentality of United States rulers; they want to make us pay a
    very high price for that peace. We reply that price cannot go beyond the
    bounds of dignity.
    <p>And Cuba reaffirms once again the right to maintain on its territory the
    weapons it wishes and its refusal to recognize the right of any power on
    earth &mdash; no matter how powerful &#151; to violate our soil, our territorial
    waters, or our airspace.
    <p>If, in any assembly, Cuba assumes obligations of a collecfive nature, it
    will fulfill them to the letter. So long as this does not happen, Cuba
    maintains all its rights, just as any other nation.
    <p>In the face of the demands of imperialism our Prime Minister posed the
    five necessary points for the existence of a sound peace in the Caribbean.
    They are as follows:

<p class="indentb">
      Cessation of the economic blockade and all economic and trade pressure
        by the United States in all parts of the world against our country.
</p>
<p class="indentb">
      Cessation of all subversive activities, launching and landing of
        weapons, and explosives by air and sea, organization of mercenary
        invasions, infiltration of spies and saboteurs, all of which acts are
        carried out from the territory of the United States and some accomplice
        countries.
</p>
<p class="indentb">
      Cessation of piratical attacks carried out from existing bases in the
        United States and Puerto Rico.
</p>
<p class="indentb">
      Cessation of all the violations of our airspace and our territorial
        waters by aircraft and warships of the United States.
</p>
<p class="indentb">
      Withdrawal from the Guantanamo naval base and restitution of the Cuban
        territory occupied by the United States.
        </p>
        
    <p>None of these fundamental demands has been met, and our forces are still
    being provoked from the naval base at Guantanamo. That base has become a
    nest of thieves and the point from which they are introduced into our
    territory.
    <p>We would bore this assembly were we to give a detailed account of the
    large number of provocations of all kinds. Suffice it to say that including
    the first day of December, the number amounts to 1,323 in 1964 alone. The
    list covers minor provocations such as violation of the dividing line,
    launching of objects from the territory controlled by the North Americans,
    tbe commission of acts of sexual exhibitionism by North Americans of both
    sexes, verbal insults, others which are graver such as shooting off
    small-caliber weapons, the manipulation of weapons directed against our
    territory and offenses against our national emblem. The more serious
    provocations are those of crossing the dividing line and starting fires in
    installations on the Cuban side, seventy-eight rifle shots this year and the
    death of Ramon Lopez Pena, a soldier, from two shots fired from the United
    States post three and a half kilometers from the coast on the northern
    boundary.
    <p>This grave provocation took place at 19:07 hours on July 19, 1964, and
    our Prime Minister publicly stated on July 26 that if the event were to
    recur, he would give orders for our troops to repel the aggression. At the
    same time orders were given for the withdrawal of the advance line of Cuban
    forces to positions farther away from the dividing line and construction of
    the necessary housing.
    <p>One thousand three hundred and twenty-three provocations in 340 days
    amount to approximately four per day. Only a perfectly disciplined army with
    a morale such as ours could resist so many hostile acts without losing its
    self-control.
    <p>Forty-seven countries which met at the Second Conference of Heads of
    State or Government of the nonaligned countries at Cairo unanimously agreed
    that:
</p>

<p class="quote">
      &quot;Noting with concern that foreign military bases are, in practice,
      a means of bringing pressure on nations and retarding their emancipation
      and development, based on their own ideological, political, economic and
      cultural ideas...declares its full support to the countries which are
      seeking to secure the evacuation of foreign bases on their territory and
      calls upon all States maintaining troops and bases in other countries to
      remove them forthwith.</p>
      <p class="quote">The Conference considers that the maintenance at Guantanamo (Cuba) of a
      military base of the United States of America, in defiance of the will of
      the Government and people of Cuba and in defiance of the provisions
      embodied in the Declaration of the Belgrade Conference, constitutes a
      violation of Cuba's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
      <p class="quote">Noting that the Cuban Government expresses its readiness to settle its
      dispute over the base at Guantanamo with the United States on an equal
      footing, the Conference urges the United States Government to negotiate
      the evacuation of their base with the Cuban Government&quot;.</p>


    <p>The government of the United States has not responded to the above
    request of the Cairo Conference and presumes to maintain indefinitely its
    occupation by force of a piece of our territory from which it carries out
    acts of aggression such as those we mentioned earlier.</p>
    <p>The Organization of American States &mdash; also called by some people the
    United States Ministry of Colonies - condemned us vigorously, although it
    had excluded us from its midst, and ordered its members to break off
    diplomatic and trade relations with Cuba. The OAS authorized aggression
    against our country at any time and under any pretext and violated the most
    fundamental international laws, completely disregarding the United Nations.
    Uruguay, Bolivia, Chile, and Mexico opposed that measure, and the government
    of the United States of Mexico refused to comply with the sanctions that had
    been approved. Since then we have no relations with any Latin American
    countries other than Mexico; thus the imperialists have carried out one of
    the stages preliminary to a plan of direct aggression.
    <p>We want to point out once again that our concern over Latin America is
    based on the ties that link us; the language we speak, our culture, and the
    common master we shared. But we have no other reason for desiring the
    liberation of Latin America from the colonial yoke of the United States. If
    any of the Latin American countries here decides to <span class="inote">[resume relations it
    must be on the]</span> basis of equality and not with the assumption that it is a
    gift to our government that we be recognized as a free country in the world,
    because we won the recognition of our freedom with our blood in the days of
    our struggles for liberation. We acquired it with our blood in the defense
    of our shores against Yankee invasion.
    <p>Although we reject any attempt to attribute to us interference in the
    internal affairs of other countries, we cannot deny that we sympathize with
    those people who strive for their freedom, and we must fulfill the
    obligation of our government and people to state clearly and categorically
    to the world that we morally support and feel as one with people everywhere
    who struggle to make a reality of the rights of full sovereignty proclaimed
    in the United Nations Charter.
    <p>It is the United States of America which intervenes. It has done so
    throughout the history of America. Since the end of the last century Cuba
    has known very well the truth of the matter; but it is known, too, by
    Venezuela, Nicaragua, Central America in general, Mexico, Haiti, and Santo
    Domingo. In recent years, besides our peoples, Panama has also known direct
    aggression, when the marines of the Canal opened fire against the
    defenseless people; Santo Domingo, whose coast was violated by the Yankee
    fleet to avoid an outbreak of the righteous fury of the people after the
    death of Trujillo; and Colombia, whose capital was taken by assault as a
    result of a rebellion provoked by the assassination of Gaitan.
    <p>There are masked interventions through military missions which
    participate in internal repression, organizing forces designed for that
    purpose in many countries, and also in coups d'etat which have been so
    frequently repeated on the American continent during the past few years.
    Specifically, United States forces took part in the repression of the
    peoples of Venezuela, Colombia, and Guatemala, who carry on an arined
    struggle for their freedom. In Venezuela not only do the Americans advise
    the army and the police, but they also direct acts of genocide from the air
    against the peasant population in vast rebel-held areas, and the United
    States companies established there exert pressures of every kind to increase
    direct interference.
    <p>The imperialists are preparing to repress the peoples of America and are
    setting up an &quot;international&quot; [network] of crime. The United
    States interfered in America while invoking the &quot;defense of free
    institutions&quot;. The time will come when this assembly will acquire
    greater maturity and demand guarantees from the United States Government for
    the lives of the Negro and Latin American population who reside in that
    country, most of whom are native-born or naturalized United States citizens.
    <p>How can they presume to be the &quot;guardians of liberty&quot; when they
    kill their own children and discriminate daily against people because of the
    color of their skin; when they not only free the murderers of colored
    people, but even protect them, while punishing the colored population
    because they demand their legitimate rights as free men? We understand that
    today the assembly is not in a position to ask for explanations of these
    acts, but it must be clearly established that the government of the United
    States is not the champion of freedom, but rather the perpetrator of
    exploitation and oppression of the peoples of the world, and of a large part
    of its own population.
    <p>To the equivocating language with which some delegates have painted the
    case of Cuba and the Organization of American States, we reply with blunt
    words, that the governments pay for their treason.
    <p>Cuba, a free and sovereign state, with no chains binding it to anyone,
    with no foreign investments on its territory, with no proconsuls orienting
    its policy, can speak proudly in this assembly, proving the justice of the
    phrase by which we will always be known, &quot;Free Territory of
    America&quot;.
    <p>Our example will bear fruit in our continent, as it is already doing to a
    certain extent already in Guatemala, Colombia, and Venezuela. The
    imperialists no longer have to deal with a small enemy, a contemptible
    force, since the people are no longer isolated.
    <p>As laid down in the Second Declaration of Havana:


      <p class="quote">&quot;No people of Latin America is weak, because it is part of a
      family of 200 million brothers beset by the same miseries, who harbor the
      same feelings, have the same enemy, while they all dream of the same
      better destiny and have the support of all honest men and women in the
      world.</p>
      <p class="quote">Future history will be written by the hungry masses of Indians, of
      landless peasants, of exploited workers; it will be written by the
      progressive masses, by the honest and brilliant intellectuals who abound
      in our unfortunate lands of Latin America, by the struggle of the masses
      and of ideas; an epic that will be carried forward by our peoples who have
      been ill-treated and despised by imperialism, our peoples who have until
      now gone unrecognized but who are awakening. We were considered an
      impotent and submissive flock; but now they are afraid of that flock, a
      gigantic flock of 200 million Latin Americans, which is sounding a warning
      note to the Yankee monopolist capitalists.
      <p class="quote">The hour of vindication, the hour it chose for itself, is now striking
      from one end to the other of the continent. That anonymous mass, that
      colored America, sombre, adamant, which sings throughout the continent the
      same sad, mournful song; now that mass is beginning definitely to enter
      into its own history, it is beginning to write it with its blood, to
      suffer and to die for it. Because now, in the fields, and in the mountains
      of America, in its plains and in its forests, in the solitude, and in the
      bustle of cities, on the shores of the great oceans and rivers, it is
      beginning to shape a world full of quickening hearts, who are ready to die
      for what is theirs, to conquer their rights which have been flouted for
      almost 500 years. History will have to tell the story of the poor of
      America, of the exploited of Latin America, who have decided to begin to
      write for themselves, forever, their own odyssey. We see them already
      walking along those roads, on foot, day after day, in long and endless
      marches, hundreds of kilometers, until they reach the ruling
      &quot;Olympus&quot; and wrest back their rights. We see them armed with
      stones, with sticks, with machetes, here, there, everywhere, daily
      occupying their lands, and taking root in the land that is theirs and
      defending it with their lives; we see them carrying banners, their banners
      running in the wind in the mountains and on the plains. And that wave of
      heightening fury, of just demands, of rights that have been flouted, is
      rising throughout Latin America, and no one can stem that tide; it will
      grow day by day because it is made up of the great multitude in every
      respect, those who with their work create the riches of the earth, and
      turn the wheel of history, those who are now awakening from their long,
      stupefying sleep.
      <p class="quote">For this great humanity has said &quot;enough&quot; and has started to
      move forward. And their march, the march of giants, cannot stop, will not
      stop until they have conquered their true independence, for which many
      have already died, and not uselessly. In any event, those who die will die
      like those in Cuba, at Playa Giron; they will die for their
      never-to-be-renounced, their only true independence.&quot;</p>

    <p>This new will of a whole continent, America, shows itself in the cry
    proclaimed daily by our masses as the irrefutable expression of their
    decision to fight, to grasp and deter the armed hand of the invader. It is a
    cry that has the understanding and support of all the peoples of the world
    and especially of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>That cry is: &quot;Our country or death.&quot;
