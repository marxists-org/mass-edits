<p class="pagenoteb">Two Chinese journalists,
K'ung Mai and Ping An, interviewed Che Guevara at his home on April
18, 1959, or, as they put it, on &quot;the 108th evening after the
victory of the revolution. &quot; Peking radio and the New
China News Agency in London gave summaries and a few direct
quotations from it, though the interview was not reported in any of Peking's
three leading newspapers. The Agrarian Reform, which Guevara
speaks about in the future tense, became law on May 17, 1959, i. e.,
in the interval between the granting of the interview and its
publication in China.</p>

<p class="fst">Reporter: Will you please tell us how
Cuba achieved her revolutionary victory?</p>
<p class="fst">Guevara: Certainly. Let us begin at the
time I joined the 26th of July Movement in Mexico. Before the
dangerous crossing on the Granma the views on society of the members
of this organisation were very different. I remember, in a frank
discussion within our family in Mexico, I suggested we ought to
propose a revolutionary program to the Cuban people. I have never
forgotten how one of the participants in the attack on the Moncada
army camp responded at that time. He said to me: &quot;Our action is
very simple. What we want to do is to initiate a coup d 'etat.
Batista pulled off a coup and in only one morning took over the
government. We must make another coup and expel him from power&#8230;
Batista has made a hundred concessions to the Americans, and we will
make one hundred and one.&quot; At that time I argued with him,
saying that we had to make a coup on the basis of principle and yet
at the same time understand clearly what we would do after taking
over the government. That was the thinking of a member of the first
stage of the 26th of July Movement. Those who held the same view and
did not change left our revolutionary movement later and adopted
another path.</p>
<p>From that time on, the small
organisation that later made the crossing on the Granma encountered
repeated difficulties. Besides the never-ending suppression by the
Mexican authorities, there was also a series of internal problems,
like those people who were adventurous in the beginning but later
used this pretext and that to break away from the military
expedition. Finally at the time of the crossing on the Granma there
remained only eighty-two men in the organisation. The adventurous thought of that time
was the first and only catastrophe encountered within the
organisation during the process of starting the uprising. We suffered
from the blow. But we gathered together again in the Sierra Maestra.
For many months the manner of our life in the mountains was most
irregular. We climbed from one mountain peak to another, in a
drought, without a drop of water. Merely to survive was extremely
difficult.</p>
<p>The peasants who had to endure the
persecution of Batista's military units gradually began to change
their attitude toward us. They fled to us for refuge to participate
in our guerrilla units. In this way our rank and file changed from
city people to peasants. At that same time, as the peasants began to
participate in the armed struggle for freedom of rights and social
justice, we put forth a correct slogan -land reform. This slogan
mobilised the oppressed Cuban masses to come forward and fight to
seize the land. From this time on the first great social plan was
determined, and it later became the banner and primary spearhead of
our movement.</p>
<p>It was at just this time that a tragedy
occurred in Santiago de Cuba; our Comrade Frank Pa?s was killed. This
produced a turning point in our revolutionary movement. The enraged
people of Santiago on their own poured into the streets and called
for the first politically oriented general strike. Even though the
strike did not have a leader , it paralysed the whole of Oriente
Province. The dictatorial government suppressed the incident. This
movement, however, caused us to understand that working class
participation in the struggle to achieve freedom was absolutely
essential! We then began to carry out secret work among the workers,
in preparation for another general strike, to help the Rebel Army
seize the government.</p>
<p>The victorious and bold secret
activities of the Rebel Army shook the whole country; all of the
people were stirred up, leading to the general strike on April 9 last
year. But the strike failed because of a lack of contact between the
leaders and the working masses. Experience taught the leaders of the
26th of .July Movement a valuable truth: the revolution must not
belong to this or that specific clique, it must be the undertaking of
the whole body of the Cuban people. This conclusion inspired the
members of the movement to work their hardest, both on the plains and
in the mountains. At this time we began to educate our
forces in revolutionary theory and doctrine. This all showed that the
rebel movement had already grown and was even beginning to achieve
political maturity....</p>
<p>Every person in the Rebel Army
remembered his basic duties in the Sierra Maestra and other areas: to
improve the status of the peasants, to participate in the struggle to
seize land, and to build schools. Agrarian law was tried for the
first time; using revolutionary methods we confiscated the extensive
possessions of the officials of the dictatorial government and
distributed to the peasants all of the state-held land in the area.
At this time there rose up a peasant movement, closely connected to
the land, with land reform as its banner....</p>
<p>To carry out thoroughly the law
providing for the abolition of the latifundia system will be the
concern of the peasant masses themselves. The present State
Constitution provides for mandatory monetary compensation whenever
land is taken away, and land reform under it will be both sluggish
and difficult. Now after the victory of the revolution, the peasants
who have achieved their freedom must rise up in collective action and
democratically demand the abolition of the latifundia system and the
carrying out of a true and extensive land reform.</p>
<p class="fst">Reporter: What problems does the Cuban
Revolution now face, and what are its current responsibilities?</p>
<p class="fst">Guevara: The first difficulty is that
our new actions must be engaged in on the old foundations. Cuba's
antipeople regime and army are already destroyed, but the dictatorial
social system and economic foundations have not yet been abolished.
Some of the old people are still working within the national
structure. In order to protect the fruits of the revolutionary
victory and to enable the unending development of the revolution we
need to take another step forward in our work to rectify and
strengthen the government. Second, what the new government took over
was a rundown mess. When Batista fled he cleaned out the national
treasury, leaving serious difficulties in the national finances....
Third, Cuba's land system is one in which latifundistas hold large
amounts of land, while at the same time many people are
unemployed.... Fourth, there is still racial discrimination in our
society which is not beneficial to efforts to achieve the internal
unification of the people. Fifth, our house rents are the highest in
the world; a family frequently has to pay over a third of its income
for rent. To sum up, the reform of the foundations of the economy of
the Cuban society is very difficult and will take a long time.</p>
<p>In establishing the order of society
and in democratising the national life, the new government has
adopted many positive measures. We have exerted great effort to
restore the national economy. For example, the government has passed
a law lowering rents by fifty percent. Yesterday a law regulating
beaches was passed to cancel the privileges of a small number of
people who occupy the land and the seashores....</p>
<p>Most important is the land reform law,
which will soon be promulgated. Moreover. we will found a National
Land Reform Institute. Our land reform here is not yet very
penetrating; it is not as thorough as the one in China. Yet it must
be considered the most progressive in Latin America....</p>
<p class="fst">Reporter: How will Cuba struggle
against domestic and foreign reactionary enemies? What are the
prospects of the revolution ?</p>
<p class="fst">Guevara: The Cuban Revolution is not a
class revolution, but a liberation movement that has overthrown a
dictatorial, tyrannical government. The people detested the
American-supported Batista dictatorial government from the bottoms of
their hearts and so rose up and overthrew it. The revolutionary
government has received the broad support of all strata of people
because its economic measures have taken care of the requirements of
all and have gradually improved the livelihood of the people. The
only enemies remaining in the country are the latifundistas and the
reactionary bourgeoisie. They oppose the land reform that goes
against their own interests. These internal reactionary forces may
get in league with the developing provocation&#8217;s of the foreign
reactionary forces and attack the revolutionary government.</p>
<p>The only foreign enemies who oppose the
Cuban Revolution are the people who monopolise capital and who have
representatives in the United States State Department. The victory
and continuous development of the Cuban Revolution has caused these
people to panic. They do not willingly accept defeat and are doing
everything possible to maintain their control over the Cuban
government and economy and to block the great influence of the Cuban
Revolution on the people's struggles in the other Latin American
countries....</p>
<p>Our revolution has set an example for
every other country in Latin America. The experience and lessons of
our revolution have caused the mere talk of the coffee houses to be
dispersed like smoke. We have proved that an uprising can begin even
when there is only a small group of fearless men with a resolute
will; that it is only necessary to gain the support of the people who
can then compete with, and in the end defeat, the regular disciplined
army of the government. It is also necessary to carry out a land
reform. This is another experience that our Latin American brothers
ought to absorb. On the economic front and in agricultural structure
they are at the same stage as we are.</p>
<p>The present indications are very clear
that they are now preparing to intervene in Cuba and destroy the
Cuban Revolution. The evil foreign enemies have an old method. First
they begin a political offensive, propagandising widely and saying
that the Cuban people oppose Communism. These false democratic
leaders say that the United States cannot allow a Communist country
on its coastline. At the same time they intensify their economic
attack and cause Cuba to fall into economic difficulties. Later they
will look for a pretext to create some kind of dispute and then
utilise certain international organisations they control to carry out
intervention against the Cuban people. We do not have to fear an
attack from some small neighbouring dictatorial country, but from a
certain large country, using certain international organisations and
a certain kind of pretext in order to intervene and undermine the
Cuban Revolution....</p>
