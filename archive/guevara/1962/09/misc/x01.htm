<p>It is not necessary to dwell upon the
characteristics of our revolution; upon its original form, with its
dashes of spontaneity which marked the transition from a revolution
of national liberation to a socialist revolution; one full of rapidly
passing stages, led by the same people who participated in the
initial epic of the attack on the Moncada Barracks; a revolution
which proceeded through the landing from the Granma and culminated in
the declaration of the socialist character of the Cuban Revolution. 
New sympathisers, cadres, organisations joined the feeble structure
to such an extent that they imparted to our revolution its present
mass character, which has now placed its stamp upon our
revolution.</p><p>When it became clear that a new social class had
definitely taken power in Cuba, the great limitations which the
exercise of state power would encounter because of the existing
conditions in the state became evident: the lack of cadres to cope
with the enormous tasks which had to be carried out in the state
apparatus, in political organisation, and on the entire economic
front.</p><p>Immediately after the taking of power, administrative
assignments were made &quot;by rule of thumb&quot;; there were no
major problems - there were none because as yet the old structure had
not been shattered.  The apparatus functioned in its old, slow,
lifeless, broken-down way, but it had an organisation and with it
sufficient co-ordination to maintain itself through inertia,
disdaining the political changes which came about as a prelude to the
change in the economic structure.</p><p>The 26th of July Movement,
deeply impaired by the internal struggles between its right and left
wings, was unable to dedicate itself to constructive tasks; and the
Partido Socialista Popular (Popular Socialist Party), because it had
undergone fierce attacks, and because for years it was an illegal
party, had not been able to develop intermediate cadres to cope with
the newly arising responsibilities.</p><p>When the first state
interventions took place in the economy, the task of finding cadres
was not very complicated, and it was possible to select them from
among many people who had the minimum basis for assuming positions of
leadership.  But with the acceleration of the process which took
place after the nationalisation of the North American enterprises and
later of the large Cuban enterprises, a veritable hunger for
administrative technicians manifested itself.  At the same time, an
urgent need was felt for production technicians because of the exodus
of many who were attracted by better positions offered by the
imperialist companies in other parts of the Americas or in the United
States itself. The political apparatus had to make an intense effort,
while engaged in the tasks of building, to pay ideological attention
to the masses who joined the revolution eager to learn.</p><p>We all
performed our roles as well as we could, but it was not without pain
and anxieties.  Many errors were committed by the administrative
section of the Executive; enormous mistakes were made by the new
administrators of enterprises who had overwhelming responsibilities
on their hands, and we committed great and costly errors in the
political apparatus also, an apparatus which little by little began
to fall into the hands of a contented and carefree bureaucracy,
totally separated from the masses, which became recognised as a
springboard for promotions and for bureaucratic posts of major or
minor importance.</p><p>The main cause of our errors was our lack of a
feeling for reality at a given moment; but the tool that we lacked,
that which blunted our ability to perceive and which was converting
the party into a bureaucratic entity and was endangering
administration and production, was the lack of developed cadres at
the intermediate level.  It became evident that the policy of finding
cadres was synonymous with the policy of going to the masses, to
establish contact anew with the masses, a contact which had been
closely maintained by the revolution in the first stages of its
existence.  But it had to be established through some type of
mechanism which would afford the most beneficial results, both in
feeling the pulse of the masses and in the transmission of political
orientation, which in many cases was only being given through the
personal intervention of Prime Minister Fidel Castro or other leaders
of the revolution.</p><p>From this vantage point, we can ask ourselves
what a cadre type is.</p><p>We should say that a cadre person is an
individual who has achieved sufficient political development to be
able to interpret the extensive directives emanating from the central
power, make them his, and convey them as orientation to the masses, a
person who at the same time also perceives the signs manifested by
the masses of their own desires and their innermost motivations.</p><p>He
is an individual of ideological and administrative discipline, who
knows and practices democratic centralism and who knows how to
evaluate the existing contradictions in this method and to utilise
fully its many facets; who knows how to practice the principle of
collective discussion and to make decisions on his own and take
responsibility in production; whose loyalty is tested, and whose
physical and moral courage has developed along with his ideological
development in such a way that he is always willing to confront any
conflict and to give his life for the good of the revolution.  Also,
he is an individual capable of self-analysis, which enables him to
make the necessary decisions and to exercise creative initiative in
such a manner that it won't conflict with discipline.</p><p>Therefore
the cadre person is creative, a leader of high standing, a technician
with a good political level, who by reasoning dialectically can
advance his sector of production, or develop the masses from his
position of political leadership.</p><p>This exemplary human being,
apparently cloaked in difficult-to-achieve virtues, is nonetheless
present among the people of Cuba, and we find him daily.  The
essential thing is to grasp all the opportunities that there are for
developing him to the maximum, for educating him, for drawing from
each personality the greatest usefulness and converting it into the
greatest advantage for the nation.</p><p>The development of a cadre
individual is achieved in performing everyday tasks; but the tasks
must be undertaken in a systematic manner, in special schools where
competent professors - examples in their turn to the student body -
will encourage the most rapid ideological advancement.</p><p>In a regime
that is beginning to build socialism, you could not imagine a cadre
that does not have a high political development, but when we consider
political development we must not only take into account
apprenticeship to Marxist theory; we must also demand responsibility
of the individual for his acts, a discipline which restrains any
passing weaknesses, and which will not conflict with a big dose of
initiative; and constant preoccupation with all the problems of the
revolution.  In order to develop him, we must begin by establishing
the principles of selectivity among the masses; it is there that we
must find the budding personalities, tested by sacrifice or just
beginning to demonstrate their stirrings, and assign them to special
schools; or when these are not available, give them greater
responsibility so that they are tested in practical work.</p><p>In this
way, we have been finding a multitude of new cadres who have
developed during these years; but their development has not been an
even one, since the young companeros have had to face the reality of
revolutionary creation without the adequate orientation of a party. 
Some have succeeded fully, but there were others who could not
completely make it and were left midway, or were simply lost in the
bureaucratic labyrinth, or in the temptations that power brings.</p><p>To
assure the triumph and the total consolidation of the revolution, we
have to develop different types of cadres: the political cadre who
will be the base of our mass organisations, and who will orient them
through the action of the Partido Unido de la Revolucion Socialista
(United Party of the Socialist Revolution; PURS).  We are already
beginning to establish these bases with the national and provincial
Schools of Revolutionary Instruction and with studies and study
groups at all levels.  We also need military cadres; to achieve that,
we can utilise the selection the war made among our young combatants,
since there are still many living, who are without great theoretical
knowledge but were tested under fire-tested under the most difficult
conditions of the struggle, with a fully proven loyalty toward the
revolutionary regime with whose birth and development they have been
so intimately connected since the first guerrilla fights of the
Sierra.  We should also develop economic cadres who will dedicate
themselves specifically to the difficult tasks of planning and the
tasks of the organisation of the socialist state in these moments of
creation.</p><p>It is necessary to work with the professionals, urging
the youth to follow one of the more important technical careers in an
effort to give science that tone of ideological enthusiasm which will
guarantee accelerated development.  And, it is imperative to create
an administrative team, which will know how to take advantage of the
specific technical knowledge of others and to co-ordinate and guide
the enterprises and other organisations of the state to bring them
into step with the powerful rhythm of the revolution.</p><p>The common
denominator for all is political clarity.  This does not consist of
unthinking support to the postulates of the revolution, but a
reasoned support; it requires a great capacity for sacrifice and a
capacity for dialectical analysis which will enhance the making of
continuous contributions on all levels to the rich theory and practice of the
revolution.  These companeros should be selected from the masses
solely by application of the principle that the best will come to the
fore and that the best should be given the greatest opportunities for
development.</p><p>In all these situations, the function of the cadre,
in spite of its being on different fronts, is the same.  The cadre is
the major part of the ideological motor which is the United Party of
the Revolution.  It is something that we could call the dynamic screw
of this motor; a screw that in regard to the functional part will
assure its correct functioning; dynamic to the extent that the cadre
is not simply an upward or downward transmitter of slogans or
demands, but a creator which will aid in the development of the
masses and in the information of the leaders, serving as a point of
contact with them.  The cadre has the important mission of seeing to
it that the great spirit of the revolution is not dissipated, that it
will not become dormant nor let up its rhythm.  It is a sensitive
position; it transmits what comes from the masses and infuses in the
masses the orientation of the party.</p><p>Therefore, the development of
cadres is now a task which cannot be postponed.  The development of
the cadres has been undertaken with great eagerness by the
revolutionary government with its programs of scholarships based on
selective principles; with its programs of study for workers,
offering various opportunities for technological development; with
the development of the special technical schools; with the
development of the secondary schools and the universities, opening
new careers; with the development finally of our slogans of study,
work and revolutionary vigilance for our entire country,
fundamentally based on the Union of Young Communists from which all
types of cadres should emerge, even the leading cadres in the future
of the revolution.</p><p>Intimately tied to the concept of cadre is the
capacity for sacrifice, for demonstrating through personal example
the truths and watchwords of the revolution.  The cadres, as
political leaders, should gain the respect of the workers by their
actions.  It is absolutely imperative that they count on the respect
and affection of their companeros, whom they should guide along the
vanguard paths.</p><p>Overall, there are no better cadres than those
elected by the masses in the assemblies that select the exemplary
workers, those that will be brought into the PURS along with the old
members of the ORI (Organizacion Revolucionaria Integrada -Integrated
Revolutionary Organisation) who pass the required selective tests. 
At the beginning they will constitute a small party, but with
enormous influence among the workers; later it will grow when the
advance of socialist consciousness begins converting the work and
total devotion to the cause of the people into a necessity.  With the
intermediate leaders of this category, the difficult tasks that we
have before us will be accomplished with fewer errors.  After a
period of confusion and poor methods, we have arrived at a just
policy which will never be abandoned.  With the ever-renewing drive
of the working class, nourishing from its inexhaustible fountain the
ranks of the future United Party of the Socialist Revolution, and
with the leadership of our Party, we fully undertake the task of the
forming of cadres which will guarantee the swift development of our
revolution.  We must be successful in the effort.</P>
