<h3>Message to the Tricontinental</h3>

<hr class="end">


    <h5><em>&quot;Now is the time of the furnaces, and only light should be
    seen.&quot;
    <br>
      Jose Marti</em>
    </h5>
    
  <p>Twenty-one years have already elapsed since the end
  of the last world conflagration; numerous publications, in every possible
  language, celebrate this event, symbolized by the defeat of Japan. There is a
  climate of apparent optimism in many areas of the different camps into which
  the world is divided.
  <p>Twenty-one years without a world war, in these times of maximum
  confrontations, of violent clashes and sudden changes, appears to be a very
  high figure. However, without analyzing the practical results of this peace
  (poverty, degradation, increasingly larger exploitation of enormous sectors of
  humanity) for which all of us have stated that we are willing to fight, we
  would do well to inquire if this peace is real.
  <p>It is not the purpose of these notes to detail the different conflicts of a
  local character that have been occurring since the surrender of Japan, neither
  do we intend to recount the numerous and increasing instances of civilian
  strife which have taken place during these years of apparent peace. It will be
  enough just to name, as an example against undue optimism, the wars of Korea
  and Vietnam.
  <p>In the first one, after years of savage warfare, the Northern part of the
  country was submerged in the most terrible devastation known in the annals of
  modern warfare: riddled with bombs; without factories, schools or hospitals;
  with absolutely no shelter for housing ten million inhabitants.
  <p>Under the discredited flag of the United Nations, dozens of countries under
  the military leadership of the United States participated in this war with the
  massive intervention of U.S. soldiers and the use, as cannon fodder, of the
  South Korean population that was enrolled. On the other side, the army and the
  people of Korea and the volunteers from the Peoples' Republic of China were
  furnished with supplies and advise by the Soviet military apparatus. The U.S.
  tested all sort of weapons of destruction, excluding the thermo-nuclear type,
  but including, on a limited scale bacteriological and chemical warfare.
  <p>In Vietnam, the patriotic forces of that country have carried on an almost
  uninterrupted war against three imperialist powers: Japan, whose might
  suffered an almost vertical collapse after the bombs of Hiroshima and
  Nagasaki; France, who recovered from that defeated country its Indo-China
  colonies and ignored the promises it had made in harder times; and the United
  States, in this last phase of the struggle.
  <p>There were limited confrontations in every continent although in our
  America, for a long time, there were only incipient liberation struggles and
  military coups d'etat until the Cuban revolution resounded the alert,
  signaling the importance of this region. This action attracted the wrath of
  the imperialists and Cuba was finally obliged to defend its coasts, first in
  Playa Giron, and again during the Missile Crisis.
  <p>This last incident could have unleashed a war of incalculable proportions
  if a US-Soviet clash had occurred over the Cuban question.
  <p>But, evidently, the focal point of all contradictions is at present the
  territory of the peninsula of Indo-China and the adjacent areas. Laos and
  Vietnam are torn by a civil war which has ceased being such by the entry into
  the conflict of U.S. imperialism with all its might, thus transforming the
  whole zone into a dangerous detonator ready at any moment to explode.
  <p>In Vietnam the confrontation has assumed extremely acute character istics.
  It is not out intention, either, to chronicle this war. We shall simply
  remember and point out some milestones.
  <p>In 1954, after the annihilating defeat of Dien-Bien-Phu, an agreement was
  signed at Geneva dividing the country into two separate zones; elections were
  to be held within a term of 18 months to determine who should govern Vietnam
  and how the country should be reunified. The U.S. did not sign this document
  and started maneuvering to substitute the emperor Bao-Dai, who was a French
  puppet, for a man more amiable to its purposes. This happened to be
  Ngo-Din-Diem, whose tragic end - that of an orange squeezed dry by imperialism
  &mdash; is well known by all.
  <p>During the months following the agreement, optimism reigned supreme in the
  camp of the popular forces. The last pockets of the anti-French resistance
  were dismantled in the South of the country and they awaited the fulfillment
  of the Geneva agreements. But the patriots soon realized there would be no
  elections -unless the United States felt itself capable of imposing its will
  in the polls, which was practically impossible even resorting to all its
  fraudulent methods. Once again the fighting broke out in the South and
  gradually acquired full intensity. At present the U.S. army has increased to
  over half a million invaders while the puppet forces decrease in number and,
  above all, have totally lost their combativeness.
  <p>Almost two years ago the United States started bombing systematically the
  Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in yet another attempt to overcome the
  belligerance [sicj of the South and impose, from a position of strength, a
  meeting at the conference table. At first, the bombardments were more or less
  isolated occurrences and were adorned with the mask of reprisals for alleged
  provocations from the North. Later on, as they increased in intensity and
  regularity, they became one gigantic attack carried out by the air force of
  the United States, day after day, for the purpose of destroying all vestiges
  of civilization in the Northern zone of the country. This is an episode of the
  infamously notorious &quot;escalation&quot;.
  <p>The material aspirations of the Yankee world have been fulfilled to a great
  extent, regardless of the unflinching defense of the Vietnamese anti-aircraft
  artillery, of the numerous planes shot down (over 1,700) and of the socialist
  countries aid in war supplies.
  <p>There is a sad reality: Vietnam &mdash; a nation representing the aspirations,
  the hopes of a whole world of forgotten peoples &mdash; is tragically alone. This
  nation must endure the furious attacks of U.S. technology, with practically no
  possibility of reprisals in the South and only some of defense in the North &mdash;
  but always alone.
  <p>The solidarity of all progressive forces of the world towards the people of
  Vietnam today is similar to the bitter irony of the plebeians coaxing on the
  gladiators in the Roman arena. It is not a matter of wishing success to the
  victim of aggression, but of sharing his fate; one must accompany him to his
  death or to victory.
  <p>When we analyze the lonely situation of the Vietnamese people, we are
  overcome by anguish at this illogical moment of humanity.
  <p>U.S. imperialism is guilty of aggression &mdash; its crimes are enormous and
  cover the whole world. We already know all that, gentlemen! But this guilt
  also applies to those who, when the time came for a definition, hesitated to
  make Vietnam an inviolable part of the socialist world; running, of course,
  the risks of a war on a global scale-but also forcing a decision upon
  imperialism. And the guilt also applies to those who maintain a war of abuse
  and snares &mdash; started quite some time ago by the representatives of the two
  greatest powers of the socialist camp.
  <p>We must ask ourselves, seeking an honest answer: is Vietnam isolated, or is
  it not? Is it not maintaining a dangerous equilibrium between the two
  quarrelling powers?
  <p>And what great people these are! What stoicism and courage! And what a
  lesson for the world is contained in this struggle! Not for a long time shall
  we be able to know if President Johnson ever seriously thought of bringing
  about some of the reforms needed by his people - to iron out the barbed class
  contradictions that grow each day with explosive power. The truth is that the
  improvements announced under the pompous title of the &quot;Great
  Society&quot; have dropped into the cesspool of Vietnam.
  <p>The largest of all imperialist powers feels in its own guts the bleeding
  inflicted by a poor and underdeveloped country; its fabulous economy feels the
  strain of the war effort. Murder is ceasing to be the most convenient business
  for its monopolies. Defensive weapons, and never in adequate number, is all
  these extraordinary soldiers have - besides love for their homeland, their
  society, and unsurpassed courage. But imperialism is bogging down in Vietnam,
  is unable to find a way out and desperately seeks one that will overcome with
  dignity this dangerous situation in which it now finds itself. Furthermore,
  the Four Points put forward by the North and the Five Points of the South now
  corner imperialism, making the confrontation even more decisive.
  <p>Everything indicate [sic] that peace, this unstable peace which bears that
  name for the sole reason that no worldwide conflagration has taken place, is
  again in danger of being destroyed by some irrevocable and unacceptable step
  taken by the United States.
  <p>What role shall we, the exploited people of the world, play? The peoples of
  the three continents focus their attention on Vietnam and learn theIr lesson.
  Since imperialists blackmail humanity by threatening it with war, the wise
  reaction is not to fear war. The general tactics of the people should be to
  launch a constant and a firm attack in all fronts where the confrontation is
  taking place.
  <p>In those places where this meager peace we have has been violated which is
  our duty? To liberate ourselves at any price.
  <p>The world panorama is of great complexity. The struggle for liberation has
  not yet been undertaken by some countries of ancient Europe, sufficiently
  developed to realize the contradictions of capitalism, but weak to such a
  degree that they are unable either to follow imperialism or even to start on
  its own road. Their contradictions will reach an explosive stage during the
  forthcoming years-but their problems and, consequently, their own solutions
  are different from those of our dependent and economically underdeveloped
  countries.
  <p>The fundamental field of imperialist exploitation comprises the three
  underdeveloped continents: America, Asia, and Africa. Every country has also
  its own characteristics, but each continent, as a whole, also presents a
  certain unity.
  <p>Our Arnerica is integrated by a group of more or less homogeneous countries
  and in most parts of its territory U.S. monopolist capitals maintain an
  absolute supremacy. Puppet governments or, in the best of cases, weak and
  fearful local rulers, are incapable of contradicting orders from their Yankee
  master. The United States has nearly reached the climax of its political and
  economic domination; it could hardly advance much more; any change in the
  situation could bring about a setback. Their policy is to maintain that which
  has already been conquered. The line of action, at the present time, is
  limited to the brutal use of force with the purpose of thwarting the
  liberation movements, no matter of what type they might happen to be.
  <p>The slogan &quot;we will not allow another Cuba&quot; hides the possibility
  of perpetrating aggressions without fear of reprisal, such as the one carried
  out against the Dominican Republic or before that the massacre in Panama &mdash;
  and the clear warning stating that Yankee troops are ready to intervene
  anywhere in America where the ruling regime may be altered, thus endangering
  their interests. This policy enjoys an almost absolute impunity: the OAS is a
  suitable mask, in spite of its unpopularity; the inefficiency of the UN is
  ridiculous as well as tragic; the armies of all American countries are ready
  to intervene in order to smash their peoples. The International of Crime and
  Treason has in fact been organized. On the other hand, the autochthonous
  bourgeoisies have lost all their capacity to oppose imperialism &mdash; if they
  ever had it &mdash; and they have become the last card in the pack. There are no
  other alternatives; either a socialist revolution or a make-believe
  revolution.
  <p>Asia is a continent with many different characteristics. The struggle for
  liberation waged against a series of European colonial powers resulted in the
  establishment of more or less progressive governments, whose ulterior
  evolution have brought about, in some cases, the deepening of the primary
  objectives of national liberation and in others, a setback towards the
  adoption of pro-imperialist positions.
  <p>From the economic point of view, the United States had very little to lose
  and much to gain from Asia. These changes benefited its interests; the
  struggle for the overthrow of other neocolonial powers and the penetration of
  new spheres of action in the economic field is carried out sometimes directly,
  occasionally through Japan.
  <p>But there are special political conditions, particularly in Indo-China,
  which create in Asia certain characteristics of capital importance and play a
  decisive role in the entire U.S. military strategy.
  <p>The imperialists encircle China through South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, South
  Vietnam and Thailand at least.
  <p>This dual situation, a strategic interest as important as the military
  encirclement of the Peoples' Republic of China and the penetration of these
  great markets &mdash; which they do not dominate yet &#151; turns Asia into one of the
  most explosive points of the world today, in spite of its apparent stability
  outside of the Vietnamese war zone.
  <p>The Middle East, though it geographically belongs to this continent, has
  its own contradictions and is actively in ferment; it is impossible to
  foretell how far this cold war between Israel, backed by the imperialists, and
  the progressive countries of that zone will go. This is just another one of
  the volcanoes threatening eruption in the world today.
  <p>Africa offers an almost virgin territory to the neocolonial invasion There
  have been changes which, to some extent, forced neocolonial powers to give up
  their former absolute prerogatives. But when these changes are carried out
  uninterruptedly, colonialism continues in the form of neocolonialism with
  similar effects as far as the economic situation is concerned.
  <p>The United States had no colonies in this region but is now struggling to
  penetrate its partners' fiefs. It can be said that following the strategic
  plans of U.S. imperialism, Africa constitutes its long range reservoir; its
  present investments, though, are only important in the Union of South Africa
  and its penetration is beginning to be felt in the Congo, Nigeria and other
  countries where a violent rivalry with other imperialist powers is beginning
  to take place (in a pacific manner up to the present time).
  <p>So far it does not have there great interests to defend except its
  pretended right to intervene in every spot of the world where its monopolies
  detect huge profits or the existence of large reserves of raw materials.
  <p>All this past history justifies our concern regarding the possibilities of
  liberating the peoples within a long or a short period of time.
  <p>If we stop to analyze Africa we shall observe that in the Portuguese
  colonies of Guinea, Mozambique and Angola the struggle is waged with relative
  intensity, with a concrete success in the first one and with variable success
  in the other two. We still witness in the Congo the dispute between Lumumba's
  successors and the old accomplices of Tshombe, a dispute which at the present
  time seems to favor the latter: those who have &quot;pacified&quot; a large
  area of the country for their own benefit &mdash; though the war is still latent.
  <p>In Rhodesia we have a different problem: British imperialism used every
  means within its reach to place power in the hands of the white minority, who,
  at the present time, unlawfully holds it. The conflict, from the British point
  of view, is absolutely unofficial; this Western power, with its habitual
  diplomatic cleverness &mdash; also called hypocrisy in the strict sense of the word
  &mdash; presents a facade of displeasure before the measures adopted by the
  government of Ian Smith. Its crafty attitude is supported by some Commonwealth
  countries that follow it, but is attacked by a large group of countries
  belonging to Black Africa, whether they are or not servile economic lackeys of
  British imperialism.
  <p>Should the rebellious efforts of these patriots succeed and this movement
  receive the effective support of neighboring African nations, the situation in
  Rhodesia may become extremely explosive. But for the moment all these problems
  are being discussed in harmless organizations such as the UN, the Commonwealth
  and the OAU.
  <p>The social and political evolution of Africa does not lead us to expect a
  continental revolution. The liberation struggle against the Portuguese should
  end victoriously, but Portugal does not mean anything in the imperialist
  field. The confrontations of revolutionary importance are those which place at
  bay all the imperialist apparatus; this does not mean, however, that we should
  stop fighting for the liberation of the three Portuguese colonies and for the
  deepening of their revolutions.
  <p>When the black masses of South Africa or Rhodesia start their authentic
  revolutionary struggle, a new era will dawn in Africa. Or when the
  impoverished masses of a nation rise up to rescue their right to a decent life
  from the hands of the ruling oligarchies.
  <p>Up to now, army putsches follow one another; a group of officers succeeds
  another or substitute a ruler who no longer serves their caste interests or
  those of the powers who covertly manage him &mdash; but there are no great popular
  upheavals. In the Congo these characteristics appeared briefly, generated by
  the memory of Lumumba, but they have been losing strength in the last few
  months.
  <p>In Asia, as we have seen, the situation is explosive. The points of
  friction are not only Vietnam and Laos, where there is fighting; such a point
  is also Cambodia, where at any time a direct U.S. aggression may start,
  Thailand, Malaya, and, of course, Indonesia, where we can not assume that the
  last word has been said, regardless of the annihilation of the Communist Party
  in that country when the reactionaries took over. And also, naturally, the
  Middle East.
  <p>In Latin America the armed struggle is going on in Guatemala, Colombia,
  Venezuela and Bolivia; the first uprisings are cropping up in Brazil [sic].
  There are also some resistance focuses which appear and then are extinguished.
  But almost all the countries of this continent are ripe for a type of struggle
  that, in order to achieve victory, can not be content with anything less than
  establishing a government of socialist tendencies.
  <p>In this continent practically only one tongue is spoken (with the exception
  of Brazil, with whose people, those who speak Spanish can easily make
  themselves understood, owing to the great similarity of both languages). There
  is also such a great similarity between the classes in these countries, that
  they have attained identification among themselves of an international
  americano type, much more complete than in the other continents. Language,
  habits, religion, a common foreign master, unite them. The degree and the form
  of exploitation are similar for both the exploiters and the men they exploit
  in the majority of the countries of Our America. And rebellion is ripening
  swiftly in it.
  <p>We may ask ourselves: how shall this rebellion flourish? What type will it
  be? We have maintained for quite some time now that, owing to the similarity
  of their characteristics, the struggle in Our America will achieve in due
  course, continental proportions. It shall be the scene of many great battles
  fought for the liberation of humanity.
  <p>Within the frame of this struggle of continental scale, the battles which
  are now taking place are only episodes &mdash; but they have already furnished
  their martyrs, they shall figure in the history of Our America as having given
  their necessary blood in this last stage of the fight for the total freedom of
  man. These names will include Comandante Turcios Lima, padre Camilo Torres,
  Comandante Fabricio Ojeda, Comandantes Lobaton and Luis de la Puente Uceda,
  all outstanding figures in the revolutionary movements of Guatemala, Colombia,
  Venezuela and Peru.
  <p>But the active movement of the people creates its new leaders; Cesar Montes
  and Yon Sosa raise up their flag in Guatemala; Fabio Vazquez and Marulanda in
  Colombia; Douglas Bravo in the Western part of the country and Americo Martin
  in El Bachiller, both directing their respective Venezuelan fronts.
  <p>New uprisings shall take place in these and other countries of Our America,
  as it has already happened in Bolivia, and they shall continue to grow in the
  midst of all the hardships inherent to this dangerous profession of being
  modern revolutionaries. Many shall perish, victims of their errors, others
  shall fall in the touch battle that approaches; new fighters and new leaders
  shall appear in the warmth of the revolutionary struggle. The people shall
  create their warriors and leaders in the selective framework of the war itself
  - and Yankee agents of repression shall increase. Today there are military
  aids in all the countries where armed struggle is growing; the Peruvian army
  apparently carried out a successful action against the revolutionaries in that
  country, an army also trained and advised by the Yankees. But if the focuses
  of war grow with sufficient political and military insight, they shall become
  practically invincible and shall force the Yankees to send reinforcements. In
  Peru itself many new figures, practically unknown, are now reorganizing the
  guerrilla. Little by little, the obsolete weapons, which are sufficient for
  the repression of small armed bands, will be exchanged for modern armaments
  and the U.S. military aids will be substituted by actual fighters until, at a
  given moment, they are forced to send increasingly greater number of regular
  troops to ensure the relative stability of a government whose national puppet
  army is desintegrating before the impetuous attacks of the guerrillas. It is
  the road of Vietnam it is the road that should be followed by the people; it
  is the road that will be followed in Our America, with the advantage that the
  armed groups could create Coordinating Councils to embarrass the repressive
  forces of Yankee imperialism and accelerate the revolutionary triumph.
  <p>America, a forgotten continent in the last liberation struggles, is now
  beginning to make itself heard through the Tricontinental and, in the voice of
  the vanguard of its peoples, the Cuban Revolution, will today have a task of
  much greater relevance: creating a Second or a Third Vietnam, or the Second
  and Third Vietnam of the world.
  <p>We must bear in mind that imperialism is a world system, the last stage of
  capitalism &mdash; and it must be defeated in a world confrontation. The strategic
  end of this struggle should be the destruction of imperialism. Our share, the
  responsibility of the exploited and underdeveloped of the world is to
  eliminate the foundations of imperialism: our oppressed nations, from where
  they extract capitals, raw materials, technicians and cheap labor, and to
  which they export new capitals &mdash; instruments of domination &#151; arms and all
  kinds of articles; thus submerging us in an absolute dependance <i>[sic]</i>.
  <p>The fundamental element of this strategic end shall be the real liberation
  of all people, a liberation that will be brought about through armed struggle
  in most cases and which shall be, in Our America, almost indefectibly, a
  Socialist Revolution.
  <p>While envisaging the destruction of imperialism, it is necessary to
  identify its head, which is no other than the United States of America.
  <p>We must carry out a general task with the tactical purpose of getting the
  enemy out of its natural environment, forcing him to fight in regions where
  his own life and habits will clash with the existing reality. We must not
  underrate our adversary; the U.S. soldier has technical capacity and is backed
  by weapons and resources of such magnitude that render him frightful. He lacks
  the essential ideologic motivation which his bitterest enemies of today &mdash; the
  Vietnamese soldiers &mdash; have in the highest degree. We will only be able to
  overcome that army by undermining their morale &mdash; and this is accomplished by
  defeating it and causing it repeated sufferings.
  <p>But this brief outline of victories carries within itself the immense
  sacrifice of the people, sacrifices that should be demanded beginning today,
  in plain daylight, and which perhaps may be less painful than those we would
  have to endure if we constantly avoided battle in an attempt to have others
  pull our chestnuts out of the fire.
  <p>It is probable, of course, that the last liberated country shall accomplish
  this without an armed struggle and the sufferings of a long and cruel war
  against the imperialists &mdash; this they might avoid. But perhaps it will be
  impossible to avoid this struggle or its effects in a global conflagration;
  the suffering would be the same, or perhaps even greater. We cannot foresee
  the future, but we should never give in to the defeatist temptation of being
  the vanguard of a nation which yearns for freedom, but abhors the struggle it
  entails and awaits its freedom as a crumb of victory.
  <p>It is absolutely just to avoid all useless sacrifices. Therefore, it is so
  important to clear up the real possibilities that dependent America may have
  of liberating itself through pacific means. For us, the solution to this
  question is quite clear: the present moment may or may not be the proper one
  for starting the struggle, but we cannot harbor any illusions, and we have no
  right to do so, that freedom can be obtained without fighting. And these
  battles shall not be mere street fights with stones against tear-gas bombs, or
  of pacific general strikes; neither shall it be the battle of a furious people
  destroying in two or three days the repressive scaffolds of the ruling
  oligarchies; the struggle shall be long, harsh, and its front shall be in the
  guerrilla's refuge, in the cities, in the homes of the fighters - where the
  repressive forces shall go seeking easy victims among their families &mdash; in the
  massacred rural population, in the villages or cities destroyed by the
  bombardments of the enemy.
  <p>They are pushing us into this struggle; there is no alternative: we must
  prepare it and we must decide to undertake it.
  <p>The beginnings will not be easy; they shall be extremely difficult. All the
  oligarchies' powers of repression, all their capacity for brutality and
  demagoguery will be placed at the service of their cause. Our mission, in the
  first hour, shall be to survive; later, we shall follow the perennial example
  of the guerrilla, carrying out armed propaganda (in the Vietnamese sense, that
  is, the bullets of propaganda, of the battles won or lost &mdash; but fought &#151;
  against the enemy). The great lesson of the invincibility of the guerrillas
  taking root in the dispossessed masses. The galvanizing of the national
  spirit, the preparation for harder tasks, for resisting even more violent
  repressions. Hatred as an element of the struggle; a relentless hatred of the
  enemy, impelling us over and beyond the natural limitations that man is heir
  to and transforming him into an effective, violent, selective and cold killing
  machine. Our soldiers must be thus; a people without hatred cannot vanquish a
  brutal enemy.
  <p>We must carry the war into every corner the enemy happens to carry it: to
  his home, to his centers of entertainment; a total war. It is necessary to
  prevent him from having a moment of peace, a quiet moment outside his barracks
  or even inside; we must attack him wherever he may be; make him feel like a
  cornered beast wherever he may move. Then his moral fiber shall begin to
  decline. He will even become more beastly, but we shall notice how the signs
  of decadence begin to appear.
  <p>And let us develop a true proletarian internationalism; with international
  proletarian armies; the flag under which we fight would be the sacred cause of
  redeeming humanity. To die under the flag of Vietnam, of Venezuela, of
  Guatemala, of Laos, of Guinea, of Colombia, of Bolivia, of Brazil &mdash; to name
  only a few scenes of today's armed struggle &mdash; would be equally glorious and
  desirable for an American, an Asian, an African, even a European.
  <p>Each spilt drop of blood, in any country under whose flag one has not been
  born, is an experience passed on to those who survive, to be added later to
  the liberation struggle of his own country. And each nation liberated is a
  phase won in the battle for the liberation of one's own country.
  <p>The time has come to settle our discrepancies and place everything at the
  service of our struggle.
  <p>We all know great controversies rend the world now fighting for freedom; no
  one can hide it. We also know that they have reached such intensity and such
  bitterness that the possibility of dialogue and reconciliation seems extremely
  difficult, if not impossible. It is a useless task to search for means and
  ways to propitiate a dialogue which the hostile parties avoid. However, the
  enemy is there; it strikes every day, and threatens us with new blows and
  these blows will unite us, today, tomorrow, or the day after. Whoever
  understands this first, and prepares for this necessary union, shall have the
  people's gratitude.
  <p>Owing to the virulence and the intransigence with which each cause is
  defended, we, the dispossessed, cannot take sides for one form or the other of
  these discrepancies, even though sometimes we coincide with the conten- tions
  of one party or the other, or in a greater measure with those of one part more
  than with those of the other. In time of war, the expression of current
  differences constitutes a weakness; but at this stage it is an illusion to
  attempt to settle them by means of words. History shall erode them or shall
  give them their true meaning.
  <p>In our struggling world every discrepancy regarding tactics, the methods of
  action for the attainment of limited objectives should be analyzed with due
  respect to another man's opinions. Regarding our great strategic objective,
  the total destruction of imperialism by armed struggle, we should be
  uncompromising.
  <p>Let us sum up our hopes for victory: total destruction of imperialism by
  eliminating its firmest bulwark: the oppression exercized by the United States
  of America. To carry out, as a tactical method, the peoples gradual
  liberation, one by one or in groups: driving the enemy into a difficult fight
  away from its own territory; dismantling all its sustenance bases, that is,
  its dependent territories.
  <p>This means a long war. And, once more we repeat it, a cruel war. Let no one
  fool himself at the outstart and let no one hesitate to start out for fear of
  the consequences it may bring to his people. It is almost our sole hope for
  victory. We cannot elude the call of this hour. Vietnam is pointing it out
  with its endless lesson of heroism, its tragic and everyday lesson of struggle
  and death for the attainment of final victory.
  <p>There, the imperialist soldiers endure the discomforts [sic] of those who,
  used to enjoying the U.S. standard of living, have to live in a hostile land
  with the insecurity of being unable to move without being aware of walking on
  enemy territory: death to those who dare take a step out of their fortified
  encampment. The permanent hostility of the entire population. All this has
  internal repercussion in the United States; propitiates the resurgence of an
  element which is being minimized in spite of its vigor by all imperialist
  forces: class struggle even within its own territory.
  <p>How close we could look into a bright future should two, three or many
  Vietnams flourish throughout the world with their share of deaths and their
  immense tragedies, their everyday heroism and their repeated blows against
  imperialism, impelled to disperse its forces under the sudden attack and the
  increasing hatred of all peoples of the world!
  <p>And if we were all capable of uniting to make our blows stronger and
  infallible and so increase the effectiveness of all kinds of support given to
  the struggling people &mdash; how great and close would that future be!
  <p>If we, in a small point of the world map, are able to fulfill our duty and
  place at the disposal of this struggle whatever little of ourselves we are
  permitted to give: our lives, our sacrifice, and if some day we have to
  breathe our last breath on any land, already ours, sprinkled with our blood
  let it be known that we have measured the scope of our actions and that we
  only consider ourselves elements in the great army of the proletariat but that
  we are proud of having learned from the Cuban Revolution, and from its maximum
  leader, the great lesson emanating from his attitude in this part of the
  world: &quot;What do the dangers or the sacrifices of a man or of a nation
  matter, when the destiny of humanity is at stake.&quot;
  <p>Our every action is a battle cry against imperialism, and a battle hymn for
  the people's unity against the great enemy of mankind: the United States of
  America. Wherever death may surprise us, let it be welcome, provided that
  this, our battle cry, may have reached some receptive ear and another hand may
  be extended to wield our weapons and other men be ready to intone the funeral
  dirge with the staccato singing of the machine-guns and new battle cries of
  war and victory.
