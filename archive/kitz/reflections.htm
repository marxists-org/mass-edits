<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>Knowing that I was engaged in Socialist propaganda prior to the foundation
of the existing Socialist organisations in this country, some comrades think
that my personal recollections of events subsequent to the decline of the
British Federation of the International and of the revival of Socialist
agitation will be of interest to readers of <em>Freedom</em>.  I do not profess
to be a facile writer, nor do I lay claim to literary ability; but I will give
as coherent a narrative as my memory will enable me to&nbsp;do.  </p>


<p>In autobiographical sketches it is expected that a writer should give some
account of his early life, and whilst I am reluctant to put my own personality
in the forefront of a narration of events in which I was a humble and obscure
actor, I think that a relation of the causes which made me an antagonist of the
capitalist system, and led me to engage during the best years of my life in
persistent warfare against it, may not be out of&nbsp;place.</p>

<p>I have been asked frequently of late years how I became a Socialist and the
reasons for my conversion. Some have hinted &mdash; not ill-naturedly, I hope
&mdash; that I was born with a rebellious kink in my composition, which is,
perhaps, near the truth. I was a fatherless lad living in a single room, for my
mother had to go out to service. I supported myself as an errand boy, porter,
and messenger in various situations: ill-shod, badly clothed, and seldom
enjoying a square meal, except occasionally when my mother smuggled me into her
employer's kitchen. This employer, I may mention, was a vitreous, scraggy old
maid, related to a well-known firm of manufacturers. She occupied her spare
time in writing to Tory magazines advocating military drill for the working
class, especially on public holidays. And now we see the working class
voluntarily lending itself to this scheme to make the gallery fight the battles
of the&nbsp;stalls.  </p>

<p>I decorated the walls of my lonely room with pictures of the French
Revolution, which I purchased out of my scanty earnings. Brought up in the
neighbourhood of the West End, with the evidences of wealth and luxury
confronting me &mdash; wealth unearned, comfort undeserved &mdash; and with my
own undeserved hardships, I needed no lectures upon surplus value or
dissertations upon economics to cause me to challenge the justice of a system
which confers wealth upon the parasites of society and clouds the lives of
thousands, as it had already darkened mine at the outset, with care 
and&nbsp;poverty.</p>

<p>At the time I am writing of it was still possible to catch glimpses, on
clear days at some points in London, of the distant Surrey hills or the
Northern heights, now obscured by an ever-extending canopy of smoke. I have an
intense love of the country, and it was my habit to make excursions on foot
nearly every Sunday, with a scanty wallet of food, into the then remaining
rural spots around the Metropolis. Those &ldquo;kneaded fields,&rdquo; as
Ruskin described them, have long since become noisy, sooty wildernesses of
bricks and mortar. In later years, when engaged in Socialistic propaganda, I
have listened with mingled anger and amusement to opponents who alleged that we
desired to destroy everything that is beautiful and upbraided us for our
&ldquo;grossly materialistic aims;&rdquo; and I have thought of the vanished
pleasaunces, the desecrated landscapes, the obliteration of every reminder of
Nature, and also of the crowded slums which have replaced those scenes. Ruskin
has poured out the vials of his wrath upon the spoilators, and Morris owed in
great part his conversion to Socialism to his abhorrence of this aspect of the
beast of Capital.  </p>

<p>I was soon to undergo wider experiences which gave shape to my ill-defined
hostility to the present system, and made of me an active propagandist against
it. I had been articled to a garment dyer, but his conditions of service were
such that I determined to seek fresh fields. I left him abruptly, and obtaining
a shilling from a too-confiding recruiting sergeant, I enjoyed a steak washed
down with stout at her Majesty's expense. The call of the road was upon me, so
getting a little help from a few friends, I sallied forth on tramp. Starting
out through Surrey, I traversed the South-East Coast, repeating near garrison
towns the recruiting experiment, for as there were rumours of war, and England
expected to be involved, the roads were being scoured to pick up likely
recruits. All the recruiting-sergeants said I was a fine young fellow who would
be better off in the service. I did not stay long enough in those parts to
gather their subsequent opinions of the &ldquo;fine young fellow.&rdquo; I had
no intention of dying for a country which condemned me to tramping and
starvation.  </p>

<p>Among my experiences on this comparatively short tramp &mdash; for I doubled
back from the Cinque Ports through Kent &mdash; I made acquaintance with
&ldquo;doss kens&rdquo; and casual wards, and often had to shelter beneath a
barn or a hedge. In passing through Rochester on my way back to London, I asked
for employment of a local dyer who was standing before his counter measuring up
the next day's work, a custom at that time. He gruffly told me, throwing down a
1/2d., that he had no room for tramps.  That night I had to sleep in a casual
ward at Strood. Upon my return to London, I learned that the dyer of Rochester
was dead, and that his widow wanted a hand. I secured the job, and returned to
Rochester to measure up work on the same spot where I had been so harshly
treated.  </p>

<p>My next tramp was undertaken in the depth of a hard winter, when the
unemployed were thronging the streets of London. This time I journeyed towards
the North, passing through the Midlands and North Wales into Liverpool, where I
arrived lame and penniless, without boots.  They had long since departed, and I
had been forced to take to my clogs. In Liverpool I secured temporary
employment, and forgetting my past troubles, the frozen roads and grim
lodgings, with the bouyancy of youth I managed to pass a pleasant time. Still,
my wanderings were not ended, and I went still further north, in all covering
over two hundred miles on foot on the upward journey alone. I found everywhere
the same conditions &mdash; the factory with its iron discipline, the mazes of
mean streets and insanitary slums for the workers, the enslavement of women and
children. He champions of the family and those who predict its dissolution
under Socialism might see what capitalism does in that direction if they
witnessed the rows of mothers outside a factory at meal times suckling their
babies brought to them for the&nbsp;purpose.  </p>

<p>In the course of my travels I met with widely different treatment when
forced to ask for assistance. I have been hospitably treated by parents for the
sake of a son, a wanderer like myself, whose whereabouts they knew not. At
other times I have been threatened having the dog set on me if I did not clear.
As a propagandist of Socialism, I have returned to some of the towns in which I
first arrived as a wanderer; and the memories of my own sufferings and the
sufferings of my class have given emphasis and force to my attacks upon the
citadel of property and&nbsp;privilege.  </p> 


<p>I need not dwell longer upon the subject of my tramping experiences. On my
return to London I settled in Soho, and here I was induced by a friend to
attend a political discussion held at a public-house ; and becoming a regular
attendant at those meetings, I there became acquainted with G. Odger, John
Rogers, G. Milner, W. Townshend, the brothers Murray, G. Harris, and G.
Eccarius, all members of the lately defunct British Federation of
the&nbsp;International.  </p>

<p>This society was styled the Democratic and Trades Alliance Association. Most
of the members were Soho tailors and shoemakers, always the most advanced
amongst the workers. I became a member and a regular attendant at the meetings.
There I made my first attempt to open a debate, reading a paper against
political action, and was sat upon heavily and informed that I would never be a
speaker and not to try&nbsp;again.  </p>

<p>Though this was my first entrance into membership of any democratic society,
I had in boyhood attended nearly every meeting or demonstration held by the
advanced movement in London. In the riot at Hyde Park at the time of the Reform
League my white printer&rsquo;s jacket made me conspicuous in the skirmishes
with the police, and only my nimbleness saved me from arrest. The police
behaved then with their usual brutality, and when a deputation from the Reform
League afterwards waited upon the Home secretary Walpole to protest against the
outrages they committed, Walpole shed tears at the recital of their doings; as
the Press had it &ldquo;he wept upon the bosom of the League.&rdquo; The League
turned the incident into profit, for at the great triumphal meeting at the
Agricultural Hall they reaped a harvest by selling Walpole&rsquo;s tears in
penny&nbsp;bottles.  </p>

<p>This is a digression, however. I was now to be a co-worker with men to whom
in the past I had been an unknown&nbsp;auditor.  </p>

<p>They have all joined the great majority, many passing away in abject
poverty, neglected and forgotten by the class for whom they sacrificed the best
years of their lives. I recall them as I write, the steadfast old guard who in
the midst of the reaction following the collapse of Chartism and the decline of
the Owenite agitation were the last remnant of the British Federation of the
International. Deserted by the Trade Unionists at the outbreak of the Commune,
they still upheld the principles of the Social Revolution. The English Trade
Union leaders of this period, with the exception of George Odger and a few
others, were the rump of the Manchester School of Liberals. They battened upon
bogus political associations and electioneering dodges of every description.
Here is a sample of their tactics. A certain Alderman who sat for a London
constituency had always employed the Mottershead party as his election
committee; but, tiring of the bleeding process, he determined to dispense with
their services in one election.  Consternation reigned in the camp of the
boodlers; visions of dry throats and empty pockets rose before them. But they
had heard that an itinerant herbalist had Parliamentary ambitions and also a
little cash.  They waited upon him as a deputation of the electors, and urged
him to put himself up as a candidate. He rose to the bait, parted with several
pounds, and the next day the division was placarded with his name posted over
that of the Alderman, who capitulated and put them upon his committee ; and the
herbalist was a sadder and poorer man. The difference between the old Trade
Unionist and the new variety is that to their credit it must be said they did
not use Socialistic phrases to cover their nefarious designs or to
gain&nbsp;power.  </p>

<p>In this survey of the time, one notes that whilst a strong Republican and
Freethought agitation was being carried on all over the country, there were
only the few elderly men of the British Federation to represent and uphold
Socialism. As a young recruit, I stood alone. Of literature there was little
worth mentioning, except that issued in the Republican and Freethought
propaganda. In passing, I must pay a tribute and own my indebtedness to them
for their sledge-hammer attacks upon the landocracy and theologians. The facts
and knowledge they spread broadcast had an educational effect which has been of
advantage to other and more advanced movements. We owe nothing to Christianity,
the historic foe of all progress. Personally, I have met only with virulent
opposition from Christian advocates when battling for Socialism. The intrusion
of Christianity into the Socialist movement to-day is designed to vitiate it
and thwart its&nbsp;aims.  </p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>But to return. Having shed some of the mere Trade Unionist members, we
evolved as the Manhood Suffrage League. Nominally a political society, its
members were the chief actors in bringing about the revival of Socialism and
laying the foundations of the present movement. Our activities at the time were
small, for it was a time of political apathy. As a delegate of this society,
with the late C.  Murray, at a conference on the land question, I defeated a
proposal by C. Bradlaugh for small proprietorship. We also took part in the
magnificent reception given to Michael Davitt upon his release from prison. I
imbibed my knowledge of past movements from my elderly colleagues who had been
associated with Robert Owen, H. Hunt, J. Harvey, Ernest Jones, Bronterre
O&rsquo;Brien, Feargus O&rsquo;Connor, W. Lovett, whom I met once before his
death, and a host of others. Dr. Travis, who was a friend of Owen, became a
member of our society, and Dr. Gammage, the historian of Chartism, was
an&nbsp;associate.  </p>


<p>A sketch of some of the members will bring me to other matters in connection
with my narrative. First in my memory is W.  Townshend, a tall, gaunt, kindly
old shoemaker, the possessor of a vast accumulation of books and knowledge
pertaining to the cause. He would read us voluminous essays upon the helots of
Greece and the plebeians of Rome, which caused a stampede of our younger and
more flippant visitors. Poor Townshend! he died in poverty, and his beloved
books which he struggled so hard to acquire fell into the hands of strangers.
Then there were the brothers C. and J.  Murray, who had been in every movement
from the Chartist onwards ; J. B. Leno, the Buckinghamshire poet, who struck at
the landlord system in rhyme and verse; J. Rogers, friend of Karl Marx; and
Maltman Barry, also on the most intimate terms with Marx. Barry had won a
certain notoriety by his tourneys with the political economists of the
Manchester school, especially Leone Levi. I and others mistrusted him, but he
appeared to break a lance for Democracy, and his intimacy with Marx made him
unassailable. Whether he used Marx or Marx used him is a point that remains
unsolved. Barry was the enemy of the old school of Trade Unionists and
Liberals, and posed as a Revolutionist. My hostility to Barry frequently
brought me into collision with my old friend J. Rogers, who worshipped him.
After years of deception, towards the close of his career he threw off the mask
and stood revealed as a Tory agent. There is another Tory who, having
manipulated the Socialist movement, has not yet unmasked ; and it is,
therefore, not a matter for surprise that Justice should publish a friendly
obituary of the late Maltman&nbsp;Barry.  </p>

<p>I have alluded to the defection of the English Trade Unionists from the
International. After the Commune, the remnant of the British Federation called
a meeting in Hyde Park to show sympathy with the Parisian workers. There was a
great gathering in response, which the Press did its utmost to belittle by
describing it as exclusively composed of foreign refugees. A second meeting
called at St. George&rsquo;s Hall was prohibited by the police, who guarded the
doors with mounted men. The capitalistic Press indulged in a furious campaign
of calumny against the Commune and all who sympathised with it. With the public
hostile or indifferent, and the secession of the Trade Unionists, it fell to
the lot of the foreign branches in London, by holding annual celebrations, to
keep alive the memory of the&nbsp;Commune.  </p>

<p>Conspicuous amongst the foreign revolutionary forces in London at that time
was the German Working Men&rsquo;s Communist Society. Founded, if I remember
rightly, after the abortive upheaval in Berlin in 1848, it became a
rallying-point and home of refuge for all who were proscribed for the cause.
Marx, Engels, Weber, Lessner, Herman Jung, were among those who associated with
and became members of this society. In conjunction with the French, Slavonic,
and Scandinavian elements of London, they organised commemoration meetings. The
Press chortled over the almost exclusively foreign character of the audiences,
and said that the British working man would never imbibe the doctrines of
foreign revolutionaries. I recall a meeting whereat L. Weber, having spoken in
German, had, in the absence of any English speakers, to address the gathering
in English. He asked bitterly, where were the Englishmen who had belonged to
the International and the alleged upholders of&nbsp;freedom.  </p>

<p>I pass over those years of triumphant reaction and apathy, and come to the
breaking of the dawn of a revival which is yearly growing in strength and
momentum. We in the small political society I have previously mentioned had our
conflicts with the purely Trade Unionist members, who, when our foreign
comrades solicited our help, opposed co-operation. The bills announcing the
celebration (and brave bills they were, with the Red Flag printed upon them)
were removed from the club-room notice board. The brothers Murray, who
represented our speaking power at the time, went unofficially to help them.
Eventually we shed this fossilised element, shifted our quarters, and blossomed
out as the Manhood Suffrage League. The advanced reader may be somewhat
surprised at the mild political titles we assumed. We were pushing forward the
doctrines of Socialism under a political disguise, whilst there are a number in
the Socialist movement to-day who are mere politicians disguised
as&nbsp;Socialists.  </p>

<p>Freed from obstruction and opposition, we cordially co-operated with our
foreign comrades in holding an international meeting at the Cleveland Hall to
celebrate the Commune. It was a most enthusiastic demonstration, and marked the
beginning of the revival. A large number of English working men attended. Our
comrades Louise Michel and Kropotkin spoke (I think that was their first
appearance upon a public platform in this country). I made my first speech in a
public hall on that evening. At an informal meeting of comrades afterwards I
was urged by my comrade Johann Neve (since done to death in a German prison) to
form an English section of the Socialist party. I succeeded in getting together
a number of comrades, including those of the British Federation whom I have
previously referred to, and thus was started an English Revolutionary Society,
which, working with the foreign element, was to take its part in the
International Socialist movement. In referring to this period I may be allowed
to mention that H. M. Hyndman, who is styled by his admirers &ldquo;the father
of Social Democracy,&rdquo; has recently published his reminiscences. I have
not perused the book, but a reviewer of it states that it is a record of thirty
years of work on behalf of Socialism. The reviewer in question must be in
error, for about the time I am writing of &ldquo;the Father of Social
Democracy&rdquo; was wooing the suffrages of a London constituency (Marylebone)
as a Tory. Some have unkindly suggested that his conversion was too sudden to
be thorough, and that his lapses into Jingoism and his Chauvinistic ideas of a
purely English Socialism are but signs of the old Adam peeping
forth&nbsp;again.  </p>


<p>New Toryism or Tory Democracy was being put forward to distract the
attention of the workers from the land question, which was being vigorously
discussed in working-class clubs and conventions. The landlords were quite
willing to divert the attacks from themselves to the capitalists, and when the
English section got to work amongst the working class we had to combat their
agents, who advocated thrift, emigration, and Malthusianism as alternatives to
Socialism.  We routed them in many a stormy meeting, and the emigrationists had
frequently to emigrate in undignified haste from the meetings they had
convened.  Another society was now formed in the East End, named the Labour
Emancipation League; and, co-operating with them, we held a great
anti-emigration demonstration upon Mile End Waste. One of the banners depicted
an angry armed crowd chasing the landlords and capitalists into the sea, as the
only kind of emigration necessary. Some have thought that this alleged
conspiracy of the landocracy to preserve their ill-gotten possessions even at
the expense of their fellow thieves, the capitalists, is a mere surmise; but
the efforts of the Tories Oastler and Shaftesbury in reference to the factory
children whilst the labourers upon the Shaftesbury Estate were in a deplorable
condition (vide Engel&rsquo;s letters upon the condition of the working class
in England); and, coming to our own times, the pressure put upon Dr Gibbins,
the author of the &ldquo;Industrial History of England,&rdquo; to abate his
condemnation of the landlords; and the reduction of the position of the
Financial Reform Almanack from being a text-book upon the land question to a
mere catalogue—these are evidences of the landlords&rsquo;&nbsp;influence.
</p><p>In these days of British Socialism, which is, I presume, a by-product of
the purely English variety, and has given us those strange human documents, the
Jingo Socialists, it may not be out of place to note that the Socialist
movement in England owes its origin largely to the propagandist zeal of foreign
workmen, who wherever they came into contact with their English confreres
sought to enthuse them with what was then, even in its Parliamentary form, a
new gospel. The C.A.B.V.  (the German Communist Society I have previously
referred to), in the masons&rsquo; strike, subscribed their funds and their
members helped to picket the Law Courts, and they were the means of getting
away again several batches of German masons who had been brought here under
false pretences. They also conducted a vigorous agitation amongst their
compatriots. When the Crown Prince Frederick visited this country, some German
tuft-hunter arranged a loyal demonstration, with a choir to sing patriotic
songs; but the Communists got there first and treated the Prince to a by no
means patriotic version of the &ldquo;Wacht am Rhein,&rdquo; ending with a free
fight and the defeat of the loyalists, which threw the English Press into a
rage. The prominence given to the German Socialist movement caused some
inconvenience, for wherever we (the English section) addressed open-air
meetings we were dubbed &ldquo;damned Germans,&rdquo; and as some of our
members hailed from the Green Isle, the description was slightly out
of&nbsp;place.  </p>


<p>Gradually we won our way.  From the West we extended outwork into the East
End. Mile End Waste was our outdoor rallying-point, and indoors—let not the
temperance reader be shocked—the club-rooms of various public-houses, where
under the guise of debating societies or similar harmless-sounding titles we
pursued our propagandist work. The Radical clubs had still a leaven amongst
them of `Chartists and Republicans, and their platforms were at our disposal.
They have long since been nobbled by the middle class and brewers, and the
amateur negro minstrel stands where the lecturer should&nbsp;be.  </p>


<p>By a combination of all the sections we established a club in Rose Street,
Soho. Having a hall of our own, we were enabled to hold public meetings with
greater&nbsp;frequency.  </p>

<p>Almost the first meeting in our new quarters (over which the late G.
Shipton presided) was that held to protest against the Liberal
Government&rsquo;s policy of coercion in Ireland. We organised a large
contingent from this club to attend the immense Anti-Coercion Demonstration
held in Hyde Park. Our revolutionary banners (which included one with the
well-known lines, &ldquo;Blessed be the hand that waves the regicidal
steel&rdquo;) roused the ire of O&rsquo;Connor Power, and he incited a section
of his followers, Roman Catholics, to destroy them. We were soon to experience
Governmental persecution&nbsp;ourselves.  </p>

<p>The passing of the Anti-Socialist Law in Germany in 1878 tried our resources
to the utmost. The club was crowded with refugees : our hall at times resembled
a railway station, with groups of men, women, and children sitting
disconsolately amidst piles of luggage. To vast numbers expatriation meant
utter ruin; it inflicted suffering and hardship upon all. Shortly after this
influx of refugees the sections jointly issued a pamphlet, written by J.
Sketchley, entitled &ldquo;The Principles of Social Democracy,&rdquo; thus
taking advantage of the interest awakened by the operations of the coercive
measures of the German Government.  Many thousands of this pamphlet were sold,
the German section bearing the major portion of the cost, in order to aid
propaganda among our own working class.  The English section undertook the
reissue of two pamphlets on Communism by H.  Glasse; they also published an
address to the amnestied Communists of Paris, and 50,000 copies of this leaflet
were&nbsp;distributed.  </p>

<p>The expulsion of the revolutionary Johann Most from Berlin, after serving a
term of imprisonment, and his arrival in London, were the signal for renewed
activity amongst the German Communists here. His fiery eloquence and poetic
fervour enthused their somewhat flagging spirits. The <em>Freiheit</em> was
established and proved a thorn in the side of the German despots. Despite their
vigilance, large quantities of this periodical were smuggled into Germany. As
the title was changed from week to week, each issue demanded a fresh
prohibition by the authorities. (One issue bore the title of Lehmann, the name
assumed by Prince William when temporarily a fugitive during the Berlin
rising.) On several occasions, however, we were puzzled by the fact that the
German Government was aware of the new titles before the paper reached Germany,
and thus forestalled us. Johann Neve and I set to work to find out the cause.
Suspecting a member who had recently joined, we supplied him with a specially
printed copy of the paper, bearing a title different from the one we actually
intended to use. The bogus title was prohibited, but the other escaped. I
regret to say that this member met with a serious accident when attending a
fete held in support of the <em>Freiheit</em>.  </p>

<p>The State Socialists of the Marxian school pursued Most with bitter
animosity. The usual charge of police spy (imitated by their English prototypes
recently in the case of Emma Goldman) was made against him.  Seeing that he
passed altogether ten years of his life in prison and that Johann Neve, his
friend and colleague, was, as I have previously related, murdered in a German
prison, this kind of espionage does not seem as profitable as the publishing of
treatises at so much nett! Serious conflicts took place between the adherents
of the old school and those who shared the opinions of Most, and eventually
resulted in a split. The State Socialists seceded and established themselves in
another club, retaining the title of &ldquo; C.A.B.V.,&rdquo; which is, I
believe, still applied to a restaurant in the West&nbsp;End.  </p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>


<p>I now have to deal with a historic event which had far-reaching results.
Russia was then, as now, groaning under an intolerable despotism; every attempt
made by the intelligent few to improve the condition of the mass was repressed
with ferocious brutality. Alexander II. and his satraps executed or imprisoned
all who tried, by even the mildest methods, to rouse the people to a higher
conception of life, until at last the Party of the Will of the People
determined to meet force by force, and on March 13, 1881, Alexander was
assassinated. The British Government (under that saponaceous old word-spinner,
Gladstone, who styled the bloodstained autocrat &ldquo;the divine figure of the
North&rdquo;!) arrested Most and seized the printing plant of the
<em>Freiheit</em>, owing to the publication of an exultant article upon the
death of the tyrant. The method of the seizure and all the subsequent arbitrary
proceedings (which ended in the infliction of a sentence of sixteen
months&rsquo; hard labour upon Most) were Russian rather than English. It is
worth noting, in passing, that Anglo-Russian ententes are always fostered when
a Liberal Government is in power in&nbsp;England.  </p>

<p>Whilst a great amount of indignation was aroused, and vigorous protests made
against this infraction of the traditional policy of England in regard to
political refugees, it was not comparable with the storm which caused the fall
of Palmerston for his betrayal of the brothers Bandura. We have seen the last
vestiges of the right of asylum destroyed by a Liberal Government, so far as
revolutionaries are concerned. The hunting of the members of the Duma when
here, and the handing over, under the Aliens Act, of refugees, to be executed
or imprisoned, has completely exploded the belief that England is a refuge for
the&nbsp;oppressed.  </p><p>The Party of the Will of the People addressed an
unavailing appeal to the new Tsar to change the policy of brutal repression and
enter on a path of reform. They said : &ldquo;You have lost a father, but we
have been bereaved of parents, children, and all we love by the murderous
agents of your power.&rdquo; More executions followed, including the hanging of
Sophie Perovskaya for alleged complicity in the assassination of the tyrant. It
will be remembered that the death of this heroic girl inspired the stirring
verses of Joaquim Miller in her&nbsp;memory.  </p>


<p>To return to the <em>Freiheit</em>. A strong committee was formed to defend
Most. The English section took up the challenge of the Government and issued a
manifesto, which sold in great numbers on the streets and was copied in extenso
by the <em>Times</em> and other dailies throughout the country. The section
also published an English edition of the <em>Freiheit</em>
(&ldquo;<em>Freedom</em>&ldquo;), of which I was the unpaid editor. There was
much speculation as to whether we would publish the incriminated article in
English. Poland, who prosecuted for the Government, had to read a translation
of the article to the magistrate at the preliminary hearing. Thereupon I
published it in the English <em>Freiheit</em> as an eloquent speech addressed
by Poland to the magistrate, thus defeating their object of enmeshing me in the
prosecution&nbsp;!  </p><p>If it had been the purpose of the Government and
their Russian allies to spread the doctrines of Socialism, they could not have
chosen a better course than the prosecution. Brassey, a member of the
Government — I forget in what capacity, but as he was a road contractor,
doubtless it was at the Admiralty - had subscribed to Most&rsquo;s election
expenses when he stood for the Reichstag, and this fact I was commissioned to
communicate to the late Lord Randolph Churchill, and he used the information to
annoy the Government and not from any other motive. On that visit to the
&ldquo;Gasworks&rdquo; I interviewed that sturdy old Radical, Joseph Cowen,
M.P. for Newcastle, who promised to contribute a large share of our legal
expenses. Catching sight of A.  M. Sullivan in the Lobby, he asked him if he
would undertake the defence of Most, and after a few moments&rsquo; hesitation,
for Most&rsquo;s opinions were opposed to his own, he said, &ldquo;This man is
being-persecuted, and I will do what I can for him.&rdquo; I also interviewed
Biggar, who contributed a small sum, for doing which he got into trouble with
his Catholic&nbsp;confreres.  </p>


<p>Before passing on to other matters, I wish to refer again to J Cowen.
Although a manufacturer upon a large scale, he had assisted every movement at
home and abroad which had for its object the overthrow of tyranny. He recruited
a legion here and fitted out a vessel at his own expense to assist Garibaldi.
Remembering the refusal of the Turks to deliver up Behm and Kossuth to the
Austrian Government, he was a bitter antagonist of Gladstone&rsquo;s pro
Russian policy in relation to the Eastern Question. And he assisted us from a
feeling of hostility to the Power whose ruthless methods are a menace
to&nbsp;mankind.  </p>

<p>In closing this account of the <em>Freiheit</em> prosecution, I may
summarise some of the points which occur in connection therewith. The whole
legal machinery of the Liberal Government was put in motion to crush a
political refugee at the instigation of Russia : but the Gladstone Government
had also in view the suppression of the germs of Socialism in this country. The
head and front of the offence of the party behind the <em>Freiheit</em> was
their propagandist efforts to spread the principles of Socialism amongst the
English working class.  They paid out of their funds towards every attempt made
in that direction. In 1879 Sketchley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Principles of Social
Democracy&rdquo; was published and issued broadcast by the German section. They
also helped to start an International Federation of Trade Unions, in opposition
to an attempt by Bradlaugh and others to set up a caricature of the old
International. Their opposition to the coercion of Ireland, and the comments of
the <em>Freiheit</em> upon the Phoenix Park affair, brought upon them a second
prosecution, when Schwelm and Mertens, two compositors, were sentenced to six
and three months&rsquo; imprisonment respectively. Schwelm, upon receiving his
sentence, pointing to the sword of justice suspended over the head of the
judge, said, &ldquo;That sword ought to fall upon you.&rdquo; A few months
later the emblem did fall upon the chief&nbsp;sheriff.  </p>

<p>As I have shown, the prosecution had the result of awakening public interest
in the question of Socialism, and the English section had now a wider field of
operations before it. Our record for a small band of men working under
difficulties was no mean one. From Marylebone in the West to Stratford in the
East we had pushed our propaganda. We had published pamphlets and issued
addresses&mdash;one to the amnestied Communists of Paris circulated
through&nbsp;Europe.  </p>

<p>But the pace was not quick enough for an ambitious young member named E.
Dunn; there was no limelight upon our obscure and ill-requited efforts; and
therefore he convened meetings of all sorts and conditions of men, from which
gatherings there evolved the Democratic Federation, the forerunner of the
Social Democratic Federation ; and thus, if we leave out of sight the other
workers of the preceding years, Dunn was the real &ldquo;father of
Social&nbsp;Democracy.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Some Tories of the Neo-Tory school attended the preliminary meetings,
including >H. M.  Hyndman, with the blushing honours of his recent candidature
still fresh upon him. That gentleman, whom Frank Harris in his book &ldquo;The
Bomb&rdquo; describes as a prosperous-looking Jewish gentleman, soon engaged in
a conflict with Dunn for the leadership, and evicted him, and has reigned with
the aid of permanent officials ever since. There have been revolts within and
secessions from the &ldquo;only&rdquo; Socialist organisation, for it was not
to be expected that patriotism could be substituted for internationalism, and
palliatives take the place of principles, without some exposure of the cloven
hoof, and consequent protests; but rigorous discipline, coupled with
slander-spread by faithful henchmen, has hitherto sufficed to preserve this
ancient&nbsp;institution.  </p>


<p>But to return to the work of the English section. With the view of starting
a no-rent agitation and an onslaught upon landlordism, our activity took
another form and we became for a time the Local Rights Association for Rental
and Sanitary Reform. The <em>Daily Chronicle</em>, amongst other papers,
reported our earlier meetings, although they said there were some suspicious
Irish and German names in our membership.  We explored the slums and published
our reports of the homes of the workers, giving the names of the titled and
lesser landlord and owners, thus causing some commotion in dark places. The
Press quickly discerned our real object and dropped us. Now at this time in
that terrestrial inferno, St. Luke&rsquo;s, a retired policeman laboured to
save his fellow creatures from perdition and earn a living for himself. We
beguiled him into letting us have his mission hall for our meetings. There we
conducted a vigorous no-rent and anti-landlord campaign.  The missioner soon
took alarm and stopped our meetings&rsquo;.  &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;all my rich subscribers will leave me if they know of it!&rdquo; We on
our side, to prove our fidelity to principle, refused to pay. A rival labourer
in the vineyard of the Lord, to wit General Booth, has entered into the sphere
of the ex-policeman&rsquo;s domain, and with the lucre bestowed upon him by the
British public for the Darkest England scheme has bought up some of the slums,
also a fully licensed house. All are in going order at increased rentals and
are a veritable godsend to the modern &ldquo;profit,&rdquo;&nbsp;Booth.  </p>

<p>Whilst conducting our agitation an anonymous subscriber helped us to publish
a pamphlet on the land laws, dealing chiefly with the Metropolitan properties of
the Bedford, Salisbury, Portman, Grafton, Portland, and other descendants of
the pimps, procurers, courtesans, and informers of the past, who now have
London in their&nbsp;grip.  </p>

<p>It should be remembered that the English section and the comrades of the
Labour Emancipation League worked with only one aim, and that was to permeate
the mass of the people with a spirit of revolt against their oppressors and
against the squalid misery which result from their monopoly of the means of
life. No thought of kudos or personal aggrandisement had entered into their
efforts to spread the light, and therefore the squabbles between would-be
leaders had no interest for them. We determined to devote ourselves exclusively
to circulating leaflets amongst the people, to do which we raised money by
means of concerts and lotteries, and purchased some printing materials, the
deficiencies of which were supplied by involuntary contributions from printing
firms where some of our members were employed. In this way a well-known firm of
Government printers furnished us with some excellent ink, paper, and other
requisites for printing our revolutionary manifestoes and addresses, for which
I now tender them my belated&nbsp;thanks.  </p><p>The methods of the Liberal
Government of the day in regard to the <em>Freiheit</em> and in Ireland made us
cautious, and to give no points we met secretly.  Our first meetings were held
in a street near King&rsquo;s Cross, but the neighbours and police becoming
inquisitive, we shifted into Boundary Street, Shoreditch, then a notorious
slum. We occupied a floor there as a co-operative printery, our next neighbours
being two deaf-mute beggars.  The denizens of the street looked askance at our
intrusion into their region, regarding us as police &ldquo;narks&rdquo;
(spies). One of our members who had the misfortune to live in their midst
reassured them, and their suspicion changed into contempt for lunatics who
could open a printery in &ldquo;our street.&rdquo; The furnishing of the
&ldquo;printery&rdquo; was a model of economy and simplicity. Our seating
accommodation was made of packing cases provided upon the involuntary plan. A
paving stone was our making-up stone and inkslab combined. Candles stuck in the
composing cases was our lighting installation; and a roller hand-press
our&nbsp;machinery.  </p><p>From this primitive establishment we issued the
leaflets &ldquo;Fight or Starve,&rdquo; an appeal to the unemployed; &ldquo;Are
We Over-populated?&rdquo; an answer to the Malthusians ; the
&ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; leaflet, which caused a question to be put in the House
of Commons in regard to its origin ; and many others, notably the &ldquo;Appeal
to the Army, Navy, and Police,&rdquo; the terms of which appeared to be so
strong to the comrade who was setting it up that at midnight he suddenly threw
down his composing stick and declared that he would not go on with it. His
place was immediately taken by another compositor in the room. That leaflet
found its way into several garrison towns. We sallied out on nocturnal
bill-sticking expeditions, and despite the destruction by the police of some of
our handiwork, we managed to placard the East End with incendiary manifestoes.
By our persistent distribution of literature and championing of Socialism in
lecture halls and schoolrooms &mdash; in fact, wherever Socialism was being
discussed we were present as upholders of the cause &mdash; we could fairly
claim a large share in bringing about the awakened interest and enthusiasm for
Socialism which prevailed at this time, especially in East&nbsp;London.  </p>

<p>Some of our members were also members of the Social Democratic Federation
and the Labour Emancipation League.  Those in the former were wasting their
time in the futile task of combatting the opportunism and Jingoism of their
shifty leader. These causes were the factors in the split which took place in
1885 and resulted in the formation of the Socialist League by the seceding
members. The purely propagandist and non-Parliamentary objects of the League
appealed to our members, and we joined it at once. We found, how ever, that the
demands upon our scanty leisure were too great to allow us to attend to both
the printing group and the League, and we finally decide to merge our work into
the League&rsquo;s, with its possibilities of a wider field of&nbsp;propaganda.
</p>

<p>True to our anti-rent campaign, we owed some rent to the landlord of our
&ldquo;printery.&rdquo; At the final meeting of our group a heated debate took
place as to the best method of settling this liability, some arguing in favour
of cash payment and others for payment in kind.  Finally, it was decided to
liquidate our indebtedness to the slum landlord by leaving him our ink-slab
(the previously mentioned paving-stone) as being akin to his own&nbsp;heart.
</p>

<p>Before describing the work and activities of the Socialist League, more
than a passing reference must be made to William Morris, the most conspicuous
amongst its founders. This is the more necessary as in the short years that
have passed since death removed this great personality from our midst a
fictitious Morris has been created by interested scribes, who have invented for
their own purposes a false legend around his memory, and seek to deprive
Socialism of the influence which his adhesion gave to the&nbsp;movement.
</p>

<p>Even the firm which bears his name, and which he with others founded to
raise the artistic taste of the public in regard to domestic decoration and
furnishing, whilst departing widely from the standard of excellence which
Morris set up, in a booklet recently published by the firm has made a slighting
reference to his Utopian&nbsp;ideas.  </p>

<p>In the opening chapters of these recollections I alluded to the causes which
mainly contributed to his conversion to Socialism, these being the hideous
squalor of our towns and the defilement of Nature by commercial greed. He saw
that the debasement of art and the destruction of natural beauty were the
certain results of a profit-mongering capitalist system, and the production of
tawdry, shoddy articles under a system of fierce competition and sweating is
destructive also of health and life; and that it was useless to expect the
modern worker to possess artistic perception under such
hellish&nbsp;conditions.  </p>

<p>He looked back longingly to a pleasanter England, when in a more spacious
age the handicraftsmen of the guilds wrought at anvil and loom the masterpieces
of artistic workmanship, the wonder of to-day. He loathed the modern factory
hell and the grimy prison towns, the slave-pens of capitalism; and this feeling
found expression in his verses. The following brief quotation from &ldquo;The
Day is Coming&rdquo; show how, like Gerald Massey and Elizabeth Barrett
Browning, he detested the factory system&nbsp;:— </p>

<div class="verse"><p>&ldquo;How long shall they reproach us where crowd on
crowd they dwell,<br />
Poor ghosts of the wicked city, the gold-crushed hungry hell?<br />
Through squalid life they laboured, in sordid grief they died,<br /> 
Those sons of a mighty mother, those props of England&rsquo;s pride.<br /> 
They are gone; there is none can undo it, nor save our souls from the curse ;<br /> 
But many a million cometh, and shall they be better or worse&nbsp;?&rdquo;</p></div>


<p>The whole of his poetry and prose is permeated with sympathy and love of the
poor, the victims of landlord and capitalistic greed. This note of sympathy
distinguishes him from many who surrounded him and who babbled of art and
culture, but were mere tuft-hunters, devoid of any desire to raise the status
of the working&nbsp;class.  </p>

<p>And thus it came about that the artist and poet, bred in luxury and trained
in an aristocratic university, met upon terms of equality men who had felt
their way towards the light from totally opposite surroundings. His keen
intuition and broad humanity had led him out from his environment towards them;
and they, enduring the horrors of the factory and the slum, revolting against
their conditions, joined hands in propagandist work against the monopolists of
the means of life.  Morris&rsquo;s preference for the society of his humbler
confreres gave great offence to some superior persons, including the great G.
B. Shaw, who upon the death of Morris wrote an obituary of him for a daily
paper, wherein he complained of Morris&rsquo;s preference for the company of
&ldquo;tinkers and tailors.&rdquo; There were several erroneous statements in
that notice, presumably paid for at ordinary press rates. The French term this
sort of thing &ldquo;making capital out of a corpse.&rdquo; Blatchford, who had
just previously had a violent quarrel with &ldquo;G.B.S.&rdquo; and patched it
up, reprinted the obituary in the <em>Clarion</em>, no doubt &ldquo;to oblige
Benson.&rdquo; I think also that in wading through the works of another
superior person, H. G. Wells, and his brand-new version of suburban Socialism
and wonderful Gulliver-like stories, I came across some sentences deriding the
street-corner Socialist orator. Morris did not object to take his share in that
kind of propaganda. At one time the police were attempting to suppress our
outdoor meetings at Bell Street, Edgware Road; and several comrades, amongst
them the late Sam ainwaring, were arrested and heavily fined, upon the usual
pretext of obstruction. Unlike the arm chair philosophers of the Wells stamp,
who sell their treatises and fearsome literary concoctions, Morris went to the
danger-point; but, much to his chagrin, the police would not molest him, but
victimised the poorer&nbsp;comrades.  </p>

<p>So convinced was he of the utility of open-air propaganda that he stood by
my side on many a windy, inclement night at the corner of some wretched East
End slum whilst I endeavoured to gain him an audience by addressing a few
listless stragglers as &ldquo;the working class of England.&rdquo; He had no
feeling of contempt for those who do the rough work of the movement. He was
well aware that the persistent efforts of the governing class to suppress free
speech is a testimony to the efficacy of this form of propaganda, and he was
willing to share the risks which working men ran when making themselves
conspicuous by outdoor advocacy of revolutionary&nbsp;principles.  </p>

<p>Although his audiences were at first somewhat mystified by his method of
delivering his message, for he was no great orator, they gradually grasped his
meaning : and as he preached to those toil-worn crowds in those gloomy East End
byways of the possibility of realising the dream of a beautiful England free
from the curse of commercialism, he would warm to his subject, and his audience
would enter into the spirit of his address. The following extract from one of
his addresses will furnish an idea of his style and give an answer to those
who, as I previously remarked, seek to claim the artist and poet, and deny his
Socialism. Speaking of the workers&rsquo; claim for a higher life, he
said&nbsp;:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;I have looked at this
claim by the light of history and my own conscience, and it seems to me so
looked at to be a most just claim, and that resistance to it means nothing
short of a denial of the hope of civilisation. This, then, is the claim : It is
right and necessary that all men should have work to do which shall be worth
doing, and be of itself pleasant to do; and which should be done under such
conditions as would make it neither over-wearisome nor over anxious. Turn that
claim about as I may, think of it as long as I can, I cannot find that it is an
exorbitant claim; yet again I say that if society would or could admit it, the
face of the world would be changed ; discontent and strife and dishonesty would
be ended. To feel that we were doing work useful to others and pleasant to
ourselves, and that such work and its due reward could not fail us! What
serious harm could happen to us then? And the price to be paid for so making
the world happy is&nbsp;Revolution.&rdquo; </blockquote>

<p>In the midst of so much that was of the earth earthy, when even Socialism
was presented by many as an urban doctrine still redolent of bricks and mortar
and the factory, his ideal of a natural life was like the sweet aftermath of
new-mown hay, which is carried by night winds from distant fields into the
city&nbsp;streets.  </p>

<p>In
&ldquo;Nupkins Awakened&rdquo; he scathingly satirised the methods of
class-made judges. In &ldquo;John Ball&rdquo; we are carried back to pictures
of ancient rural England, with a love tale subtly interwoven into the story, of
the Kentish priest and the rising of the peasants. The poet is, after all, the
fashioner of men thoughts, and sometimes the prophet of vast changes in this
everyday, prosaic world ; and in &ldquo;News from Nowhere,&rdquo; which was
written in opposition to Bellamy&rsquo;s &ldquo;American store
Socialism,&rdquo; we have a glimpse of the coming fight between the
&ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have-nots.&rdquo; When the Armageddon of
Labour is fought, his idealism will mayhap be the guiding thought which will
give it inspiration; and the soil of England, of which we have been despoiled
by violence and legal chicanery, be yet the home of a really free and happy
people. To bring this about, the strike will give place to the taking back of
our common heritage, the land, and the means of life produced from it. In that
time which we hope and strive for, his solemn words of warning and hope in
&ldquo;All for the Cause&rdquo; will be realised&nbsp;:&mdash; </p>

<div class="verse"><p>
&ldquo;Some shall pause awhile and ponder on the bitter days of old,<br /> 
Ere the toil of strife and battle overthrew the curse of gold ;<br />
Then twixt lips of loved and lover solemn thoughts of us shall rise ;<br />
We who once were fools and dreamers, then shall be the brave and wise.<br /> 
There amidst the world new-builded shall our earthly deeds abide,<br />
Though our names be all forgotten, and the tale of how we died.&rdquo; 
</p></div>

<p>In the police-court proceedings which followed upon the attempt of the
authorities to suppress free speech at Dod Street, Limehouse, a charge was
trumped up against him of assaulting a constable in court.  The Nupkins on the
bench, Sanders, had never heard of William Morris, and was unmercifully chaffed
throughout the Press for his ignorance. A cartoon appeared representing Sanders
tearfully blacking Morris&rsquo;s boots.  When the latter left the court he
received a great ovation from a tremendous crowd outside, which somewhat
perturbed him, for he disliked hero-worship; but it evidenced the feeling of
the East-Enders towards&nbsp;him.  </p>

<p>Writing of this reception of Morris by the people of the East End reminds me
of the ovation accorded G. R.  Sims some years before, when he had touched the
hearts of the people by his writings, notably his &ldquo;Christmas Day in the
Workhouse.&rdquo; That gentleman is now only known to fame as the patentee of a
hair restorer, which is but right seeing that his later literary effusions are
calculated to cause baldness. Sims had shaken hands with the late King, and
space will not permit of giving a list of those who, from Chamberlain
(erstwhile Republican) down to the editor of Justice, have gone astray after
undergoing that fateful&nbsp;handshake.  </p>

<p>Dealing with the motives which led Morris to
attack the system which has surrounded us with ugliness and squalor reminds me
that the Anti-Socialists have issued a leaflet warning us of the danger to art
and culture should Socialism prevail. This combination of the most sinister
anti-human interests &mdash; land thieves, slum owners, stock jobbers, proprietors of
the reptile press, all of the kind which the late Bronterre O&rsquo;Brien
depicted in his &ldquo;Vision of Hell&rdquo; &mdash; standing as the defender of art,
is a sight to make angels weep. Their hireling-speakers are continually
attempting to besmirch the memory of Morris, but that is beyond the power of
those who, as Ruskin has said, &ldquo;pawn the dirty linen of their souls in
order that they may&nbsp;dine.&rdquo; </p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>Many
provincial branches severed their connection with the 
S.D.F. and joined the newly formed League, of which new
branches were formed in fresh centres. It was in the course of furthering the
provincial propaganda that I revisited many towns where, as I have previously
related, I had formerly arrived as a tramp. The propaganda was carried into
Wales, Mainwaring and myself holding meetings at Aberdare, Merthyr Tydvil, and
upon the historic Rocking Stone at Pontypridd, Mainwaring using the Welsh
language in his addresses. We might fairly claim to have been the pioneers in
Wales of modern Socialism, which has now taken root in the Principality.
Certainly, the real Prince of Wales, the arquis of Bute, will not fail to
furnish the Welsh with object-lessons in landlord rapacity and greed. Acting
upon his right of possession, he has quarried and sold half the mountain upon
the summit of which the ancient Rocking Stone stands. Popular clamour at the
desecration of an ancient landmark has been of little use to arrest the work of
destruction. And why not? Can&rsquo;t a Marquis do what he likes with his
own&nbsp;mountain?  </p>

<p>In summarising the work of the League, its leaflets were the most effective
method of propaganda. Amongst those issued were &ldquo;Ireland a Nation&rdquo;
showing the futility of Nationalist proposals to free Ireland; &ldquo;The
Causes of Prostitution&rdquo;; T. Barclay&rsquo;s (Leicester) inimitable parody
upon the old nursery rhyme, &ldquo;The House that Jack Built&rdquo; (when will
this be republished?) ; and many others, including one by myself, an
&ldquo;Address to Working Women and Girls,&rdquo; which the S.D.F. have done
me the honour to republish &mdash; without&nbsp;acknowledgment.  </p>

<p>Events across the Atlantic were to give the League an opportunity to
distinguish itself from the State Socialists. Men, women, and children had been
shot and bludgeoned by Pinkerton&rsquo;s police and the militia in the
ferocious and brutal attacks upon unarmed crowds in the eight-hour agitation in
Chicago. At last, after many had been murdered, some one (who has never been
discovered) threw a bomb at the police who, at the memorable meeting in the
Haymarket on May 4, 1886, were advancing upon the people; and this time the
police were slain. Although this act of reprisal stopped the murders by the
police, it furnished a pretext for the arrest of eight of those most prominent
in the Labour agitation. Of the subsequent infamous trial and martyrdom I
cannot write here. My object is to show the attitude taken up in this country
by the League and other advanced sections in relation to these
tragic&nbsp;events.  </p>

<p>The capitalists of America and other countries deluded themselves with the
belief that the hanging of our devoted comrades &mdash; Parsons, Spies, Engel,
and Fischer &mdash; had stamped out the embers of Anarchy. The reptile press on
both sides of the Atlantic, guided by a common inspiration of hatred towards
the workers, gloated over the tragedy of November, 1887 ; and, indulging in an
orgy of abuse and calumny of our martyred comrades, vainly hoped that by the
stifling of their voices they had secured undisturbed mastery of their own
position. But the dying words of August Spies, &ldquo;There will come a time
when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you strangle
to-day,&rdquo; were a call to action to the comrades on this side. The
Socialist League, with comrades of the Labour Emancipation League and the
Freedom Group, determined to do their utmost to defeat the object of the
infamous trial and judicial murders in Chicago, by publishing the lives and
speeches of the condemned men, with a record of the events which led up to the
culminating tragedy. At this distance of time I cannot compute the thousands of
copies which were issued in several editions of the &ldquo;Chicago
Martyrs.&rdquo; The sale was phenomenal, and cheaper editions were published.
The widow of Albert Parsons came over at our invitation, and delivered a series
of lectures which were fully attended.  Through all the intervening years the
memory of our Chicago comrades has been kept green by annual celebrations
convened by the Socialist League and later by the Freedom Group. Sometimes the
police have deprived us of the use of halls for these meetings, but that has
not prevented the gatherings being held. As the years have rolled by we have
witnessed the growth and spread of Anarchism, and the attempt to silence it on
the scaffold has been&nbsp;frustrated.  </p>

<p>The State Socialists lent no assistance to keep alive the memory and
principles of the Chicago men.  &ldquo;Father&rdquo; made it the occasion to
put a pamphlet on the market, but his followers were advised to abstain from
attending the commemoration meetings. A similar line of policy was pursued over
the May Day celebrations.  The International Congress held at Paris in 1889 had
decided to hold mass meetings throughout the world on the First of May each
year, to show the solidarity and international character of the workers&rsquo;
movement. The Trade Unionists decided upon a Sunday demonstration, and the only
Socialist societies which held the first (1890) May Day meeting in England upon
the First of May were the Socialist League, the foreign sections, and the
Federation of All Trades and Industries, led by Jack Williams. The
&ldquo;only&rdquo; Socialist organisation declined to come out. A successful
meeting was the result of our combined efforts, and it created a very different
effect to that held the following&nbsp;Sunday.  </p>

<p>There existed, however, in the League itself opposing elements which
eventually led to its disruption. The merely negative policy of
Anti-Parliamentarianism could be endured by the West End branches, of which
Hammersmith was the strongest, and in which Morris&rsquo;s personality was
dominant; but the East End comrades, confronted by a fierce struggle for
existence and in the midst of gigantic Labour conflicts, drifted towards a
definitely Anarchist attitude. A quantity of ink bus been shed over the
question of the split between the West and East End branches which caused the
dissolution of the League; but the temperamental differences have always been
ignored. Many of the West End members would have found a more suitable
environment and method of exposition of their ideals within the ranks of the
I.L.P. or the Fabian Society; and, as I have indicated, it was only
Morris&rsquo;s personality which caused them to give a lip-service to opinions
from which many of them have since seceded. They seemed to be afflicted with
the timidity of anaemic respectability. After a deal of friction between the
diverse elements, a climax was reached, occasioned by an article in the
<em>Commonweal</em> by my co-editor, D.  J. Nicoll, on the question of tactics.
The publication of a second instalment of it was made a test question by the
Hammersmith branch, and as he refused to withdraw it, they severed their
connection with the League. As indicative of the attitude of this branch,
before leaving this portion of the subject I may mention that at a meeting held
in the East End (a Commune celebration, I think) the Hammersmith choir refused
to render the whole of the &ldquo;Carmagnole,&rsquo;&rdquo; and deleted the
verse containing the line, &ldquo;Their gods to hell may fly,&rdquo; as
repugnant to West End respectability and Hammersmith&nbsp;orthodoxy.  </p>

<p>The advanced sections migrated to the East End, and became for a time the
London Socialist League, the <em>Commonweal</em> appearing as an Anarchist
journal. The Walsall police plot and the condemnation of Fred Charles and
others to long terms of penal servitude brought forth an indignant article in
the <em>Commonweal</em>, to which the police replied by seizing the paper and
arresting the editor and writer of the article. It would need greater space
than is at my disposal to give a complete narrative of all the circumstances
which led up to a course of police persecution and prosecutions directed
against the English Anarchists.  When in 1881 I had charge of the defence of
Most, I was assured by some of the Radical Club delegates to the Defence
Committee (rebels of the Sunday-morning-club-visitor type) that no Government
would dare to prosecute Englishmen for free expression ; and the English Press,
whilst chortling over the almost exclusively foreign character of the Socialist
movement of that time, said Englishmen would never imbibe the doctrines of
foreign revolutionaries. The absence of repressive measures against English
movements was due to their innocuous nature and the passivity of the
Anglo-Saxon &mdash; in short, it is not necessary to muzzle&nbsp;sheep.  </p>

<p>However, the capitalist Governments have forced the pace. From the
prosecution of aliens and the restriction of the right of asylum, they proceed
quite naturally to incarcerate Englishmen for expressing opinions hostile to
the established order, and have introduced Russian methods in their police
prosecutions. We are about to see the most brutal features of American labour
disputes imitated here by the international exploiters &mdash; Pinkertons and
hired auxiliary police It is to be hoped that the organised working men will be
prepared to give a good account of these vermin. And so the logic of events is
driving the English working class forward on the path towards
social&nbsp;revolution.  </p>

<p>Those whom the gods seek to destroy they first make mad. So runs the ancient
proverb ; and as an old man at one time somewhat despondent of the success of
the revolutionary cause, I thank our masters for their recent persecution as
supplying the needed stimulus to the movement for the overthrow of the
present&nbsp;system.  </p><p>I have related in these reminiscences the growth
of the Socialist revival from the nucleus of a handful of poor men, without
literature and with scarcely any speakers or meeting-places, up to the present
development of the Socialist and Anarchist movements in this country. I have
been asked to mention the names of some of those who played a part in those
early days. Some have joined the great majority. Where all co-operated for the
cause, it would be invidious to mention one or two names. The purpose of
writing these recollections will have been served if it shows to those who have
entered the movement later, especially our younger comrades, what a few can do
against almost insuperable odds.  The reader will have followed the evolution
of the movement I have described from Parliamentary Socialism to
Anti-Parliamentary, and onward to Anarchism; and in bringing these
reminiscences to a close it may not be out of place, whilst dealing with the
Anarchist position, to give some of the personal and general reasons which have
caused the severance from Parliamentary Socialist agitation and repudiation of
its methods and&nbsp;objects.  </p>


<p>In the past, like many others, I would have preferred the line of least
resistance as a path towards the goal of common ownership of the means of life,
if Parliamentary methods had presented a feasible possibility of arriving at
that consummation alone, viz., the administration things and not of persons.
But as the spectacle of a wealthy prelacy preaching the doctrines of lowliness
and poverty, no less than the lies, slander, and blackguardism of their
hindmost supporters, the Christian Evidence Society, made me an antagonist of
Christianity ; so likewise have the persecuting, despotic methods of the State
Socialists within their nascent organisations shown me what would happen to
minorities under their majority rule. They have displayed a bitter spirit of
persecution, misrepresentation, and abuse towards those who, whilst in
agreement with them as to the common ownership of the means of life, differ
upon the question of tactics and method of agitation. Their nebulous attitude
and even dalliance with Christianity, their display of Jingoism in reference to
the questions of armaments and patriotism, and- their bolstering up of the
State in its inquisitorial and Puritanical interference with the liberty of the
individual, even if we had not the pronouncements of Webb and Shaw to guide us,
would make us alive to the danger of State Socialism. In a pamphlet entitled
&ldquo;Socialism v.  Anarchy,&rdquo; issued by A. M. Simons, of the
International Socialist Review, in Chicago, after the death of President
McKinley, being a report of an address delivered against the Anarchists, there
occur several statements which, as they resemble the stock arguments used
against us by Socialist opponents, may be summarised here. He denies that
Socialists desire &ldquo;a further extension of the powers of
Government,&rdquo; and states further that &ldquo;they are seeking to educate
the people to use their ballots to the end that the workers may become the
rulers in the present State, and then use the governmental machinery to abolish
exploitation and oppression. This is the only movement that antagonises Anarchy
at every turn.&rdquo; We are then assured that there is nothing in the
philosophy of Anarchy at variance with Capitalism, and hence the reason why we
are petted by the capitalists. I have thought over this &ldquo;petting,&rdquo;
from Pere la Chaise, Waldheim, Montjuich, and the hecatombs of victims of
Russian despotism, who only wanted to use their ballots, to the ballot-box
stuffing and the bludgeoning and shooting of those under the American Eagle,
who also sought to use their ballots to abolish&nbsp;exploitation.  </p><p>The
disillusionment of Anarchists and Direct Actionists as to the efficacy of
Parliamentary methods has been mainly the work of Governments themselves. They
have shown that they do not intend the political machine to be used in the
manner so fondly dreamed of by the State Socialists. They will allow a minority
to participate in the work of tinkering at legislation (vide Lloyd George), but
the possibility of a Socialist majority would be met by provoking a conflict or
gerrymandering the constituencies. Let the Standard speak. Alluding to the
common ownership resolution passed at a Trades Union Congress some years ago,
that organ of the classes then said :&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Assuming for a moment that the majority of the electors in
the United Kingdom were bent upon such spoliation as the Congress proposes,
assume that they seriously set themselves to put the will of the people into
law, even then the battle would not have been won or lost. The strength of the
propertied classes is not to be measured by the counting of noses, and the
promoters of the Social Revolution would find themselves confronted by sterner
arguments than platform rhetoric or Parliamentary divisions. Only by force can
such changes be effected, and in these days force does not lie in
numbers.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>Others have discovered the truth of this last sentence, and may utilise its
lesson; but it was written against the political aspirations of the State
Socialists. Whether it be a Republic, a Monarchy, or an Autocracy, force is its
final&nbsp;expression.  </p>

<p>We have borne the brunt of the attacks of the propertied classes, and our
list of martyrs in the cause of human freedom is not recruited by the armchair
Socialists or the pedants who cling to an exploded political shibboleth.
Doubtless they will come in as &ldquo;experts&rdquo; and want to direct the
coming storm. In such a case we may remember their past &ldquo;services,&rdquo;
and reward them in such measure as they&nbsp;deserve.  </p>

<p>The chief of the tactical differences between the Anarchist and the
Socialist position is in regard to religion. As I have shown, the Socialists
have temporised with Christianity because of the belated adhesion of a few
clerics to a mild version of Christian Socialism. We know that a creed
rehabilitated at the expense of the workers&rsquo; movement would close the
door of knowledge to the people, especially the children, in order to bolster
up their superstitious&nbsp;creed.  </p>

<p>Our comrades are imprisoned for anti-militarist propaganda, while the Jingo
Socialists (!) pocket fees for writing articles in favour of patriotism and the
increase of armaments for the columns of capitalist papers which are
notoriously bitter and virulent enemies of the working class. And when these
same gentlemen tell us that the Government of the future will be &ldquo;a
gigantic statistical information bureau,&rdquo; we are not
especially&nbsp;enthused.  </p>


<p>If force alone will effect a change, we will approach the coming conflict
with the full determination to end political domination and the exploitation of
man by man; and bearing in mind the lessons learnt from the mistakes of past
revolts, the extinction of human slavery will be our battle-cry in &ldquo;the
last grand fight to&nbsp;face.&rdquo; </p>
