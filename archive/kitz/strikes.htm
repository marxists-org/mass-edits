<h2>SOCIALISM AND STRIKES.</h2>
<h2> AN ADDRESS DELIVERED BEFORE THE PROPAGANDA COMMITTEE OF THE SOCIALIST LEAGUE</h2> 

<p class="fst"> Comrades, &mdash; It has been thought advisable at this period
of agitation amongst the workers, to say a few words as to the attitude which
we of the International Revolutionary Socialist Party should assume towards
Strikes and the Labour Struggle generally. Some amongst us would seize every
opportunity afforded by labour troubles to organise the hitherto unorganised
portion of the workers, to wring even partial concessions in the hope of
shorter hours and better pay from their masters, and justify this line of
action on the ground that organisation in itself is good and raises the mass;
also that it will tend to lead to higher results after the first demands have
been won. On the other hand, a number of our comrades are opposed to joining in
a demand for palliatives, and assert that such a line of agitation is liable,
to obscure the higher ideal, viz., the complete overthrow of the wage system,
and to cause our speakers to temporise and form questionable alliances for the
sake of gaining minor points. And if we review the situation as we find it
to-day, after one of the most singular strikes of modern times, there is some
ground for the fears of the last-mentioned section. 
</p>

<p> We have seen a replication of the proletariat and aristocrat even in the
proletarian upheaval. The men who did the pioneer propagandist work amongst the
masses at the East-end and other parts of the metropolis, did it at a time
when, the word Socialist meant to subject him to whom it was applied to hatred
and execration, and not plaudits. They laid, under the folds of the red flag
the foundation for that change of ideas and conversion, the first fruits of
which was the revolt of labour in East London. 
</p>

<p> Now we have seen a strange spectacle. A bishop, endowed with thousands per
annum, as the exponent of the doctrines of the Nazarene who knew not where to
lay his head, a prince of the church of another sect, a chief magistrate of at
once the richest and poorest city on earth, suddenly develope an interest in
the docker, and the Conflict between him and his oppressors is brought to an
end. The docker is said to.have won, and perhaps he believes it. And still
stranger spectacle, a commissioner of police, under whose orders numbers of
workmen have been bludgeoned, suddenly withholds his aid to capital and stands
on one side ; the capitalist press, choking with suppressed rage, half curses
the principal figures in the strike for the terrible shock the strike has given
them, and the force with which the truth of the axiom, "that labour and not
money is the source of all wealth," has been driven home. Their utter impotency
in face of this stupendous movement on the part of an hitherto despised class
has exasperated them, and yet they can find breath to praise the "moderation",
tact, and generalship of the leaders, and strangely enough the police
commissioner shares this praise with the "leaders." It is related of a
traveller in a strange land, ignorant of both its language and currency, that
he detected when he was being robbed by the smiles of those with whom he had
to deal. It has been said, that the revolutionary Socialists of London, when
[illegible] the presence of disappointed middle-class parliamentary candidates
and would-be candidates, who [illegible] rending the air, &mdash; that these
men, gathering their inspiration from pure enthusiasm and honest conviction,
went into the byways and highways of this huge city and spoke their gospel
without fear, established their presses and scattered their literature
broadcast; that subsequently, when from a handful they grew into a power, these
men, obscure and without ostentation, still exercised a potent influence in the
revolutionary movement. Time has wrought many changes in the movement, but a
few of the pioneers remain ; and I appeal to the young men of our party when I
ask : Will they help to push forward by steady and persistent agitation the
principles of international revolutionary Socialism, symbolised by the red
flag, and by self-education and sacrifice spread them ? If so, then I ask them
not to allow the results of revolutionary agitation to be turned to account by
designing men for the purpose of defeating the revolution. We have seen during
the late labour agitation the red flag rigorously excluded from having a place
in the processions, and speakers who were likely to draw a moral from the
strike in favour of the overthrow of the whole cursed system which breeds the
misery of the workers were bidden to stand aside. Why ? What is the price of
the compact which has caused this exclusion? When and where was it agreed upon,
and what are its' main purpose and results? 
</p>

<p> The price of the compact is that the capitalist may be attacked in the
towns. Some concessions may be wrung from him, and urban life made tolerable to
a larger number than at present. Even Lord R.  Churchill is in favour of
parish-built barracks, "suitable to the class who would inhabit them" ; and why
? Because the capitalist, by his overreaching greed, has jeopardised the whole
position of privilege and power. He is the hasty clumsy thief who betrays the
whole gang, and the landlord portion of the gang are willing that the
capitalist shall lose a little that they may not lose all. A section of
advanced Tories &mdash; for the "old order changeth " &mdash; more prescient
than the fossils who would still pursue the methods of Castlereagh and
Sidmouth, see in the condition of East London and similar districts of our
large towns the glimmering light of a social revolution; and they would go the
length of making a Jonah of the capitalist to save the ship of State with its
aristocratic places and emoluments. And hence we see a group of men who once
were under the red flag, hastening to avow their severance from it and its
associations, and acting the part of saviours of society amid the plaudits of a
corrupt press and class. "To what base uses may we not come, Horatio," when we
cheer the bludgeoners of Trafalgar Square ! 
</p>

<p> I wish it to be clearly understood that I am not joining in or echoing the
pitiful complaints that have emanated from another quarter upon the same
matter. For whilst I have no quarrel with the rank and file of the S.D.F.,
except for their subserviency and lack of independence, and the ready manner in
which they lend themselves to spread the slander of their leader (having had
some personal experience of the cowardly unctuous methods by which the
machinery, of the S.D.F. can be used to spread slanderous tales, headed "Dear
comrade" and finished "Yours fraternally"), I do not wonder at the secession of
robust men from a circle whose methods of propaganda closely resemble the
efforts made by cheap-jacks or the vendors of the latest soap to draw attention
to their wares. In their hands the red flag has been associated with schemes of
the model dwelling and parish soup kitchen order. 
</p>

<p> Looking back over the past years, and knowing something of the origin of
the "only Socialist organisation in Great Britain," and being fully aware how
time and outside educational influences has mellowed and refined the
undoubtedly strong Jingo-Tory flavour it once possessed, and knowing also the
close connection which existed between one at its head now and another who is
supposed to be behind the secessionists, one can only come to the conclusion
that a game has been played in which the most astute has won. 
</p>

<p> Extremes meet, and after all there exists a close connection between the
phalansterie and the model industrial dwellings which certain Tory Democrats
would see established, in order to bolster the present system and give it a
renewed lease. But every lover of freedom must view with apprehension the
remotest possibility of their realisation, and &mdash; saying to either "A
plague upon both your houses!" &mdash; we will pass on to the consideration of
the position which, in my opinion, Leaguers should take up in the future. I
hold that by organising the disorganised workers, and by strikes and
combinations leading them to revolt against their taskmasters, and still on to
the Universal Strike that shall put an end to the wage system itself, we are
doing distinctly revolutionary work. 
</p>

<p> Passing from the crowded cities and towns out into the broad fields, amidst
the overworked and insufficiently fed agricultural labourers, lays our sphere
of action. The peasantry have been made the stepping stones, upon which men
like Arch have climbed to St. Stephens. The Liberal and Tory would give a few
small patches of land as a sop, the one as an electioneering dodge, the other
as a Conservative measure, and basing his calculations upon the known
selfishness of a small  endowed class, would make them a barrier to the
fulfilment of the wider aspirations of the landless, whether of town or
country. Our provincial comrades should sally, into the villages and fields
with the cry of "Back to the Land ! The Land for the People !" Our peasantry
have sturdy revolutionary traditions, and can be stirred anew to action by
earnest, hearty, and breezy watchwords ; a vigorous uncompromising agitation
upon the Irish pattern but with higher aims, the enfranchisement of all, and
not, as in Ireland, for a small farmer class, would bear speedy fruit. The
urban workman would be freed from the fear of competition on the part of his
agricultural comrade, and would be induced to assist him in his efforts towards
freedom.  By education, agitation, and organisation, we should then complete .
the circle closing in upon both landlord and capitalist, and effectually defeat
any attempt to avert the Revolution.  <em>F. Kitz.</em> </p>
