<h2>BASTILLE, BOURGEOISE, AND BUMBLE.</h2> 

<p>Amongst the many indignities and miseries endured by the poor, none 
is so keenly felt or bitterly resented as those inflicted under the Poor 
Law. The poor rightly consider this as a heartless measure for the 
punishment and not the relief of their poverty and that this view is 
shared by the Poor Law officials themselves is shown by their brutal 
methods of administration. Scarcely a week passes but some poor 
wretch is done to death by the callous brutality of these minions of the 
brutal bourgeoisie, or some worn out worker commits suicide to avoid 
receiving the attention of the "Guardians of the Poor."</p> 

<p>We Socialists are engaged in a movement which regards both pauper 
and criminal as the products of an iniquitous system of robbery of which 
both aristocrat and hateful bourgeois stand guilty. Those who oppose 
us in this view often tell us that the present system is the result of 
Societary Evolution, for which no particular class is to blame. It is 
impossible within the limits of an article to give a history of the working 
class or the Poor Law, but as a student of both and as a worker I 
assert that the wrong and suffering endured by us to-day are the result 
of deliberate, well-planned robberies on the part of the idle classes of 
society, and it will be an ill day for them if the workers in a moment 
of power should treat these parasites to a tittle of the torture to which 
by their laws they have subjected the poor.</p> 

<p>Only glancing at the robbery of millions of acres of common and public lands
from the peasantry, and hindrances to locomotion and knowledge in the past
&mdash; all contributary causes of poverty &mdash; let us fix our attention on
a period which is regarded with affectionate interest by the middle olass, that
of the Reform Bill of 1832, and its pendant the Municipal Reform Act, 1834. The
working class had aided the bourgeoisie to break the power of the ruling
families and installed the middle class in office.  "Help us," said they, 
"and your enfranchisment is assured."; "The Bill, the whole Bill," they cried,
and in truth the gulled workers got nothing but the Bill. Their reward was a
most infamous cold-blooded Poor Law. They punished them for poverty created by
their despoilers.  Those whom O'Connell before his apostasy from the people's
cause, fittingly described as "the base brutal and bloody Whigs," gave
Malthus's inhuman denial of the right of the poor to live, concrete expression
in the Poor Law Amendment Act of the clay. Coleridge in his "Table Talk,"
speaks of the practical father of this measure as follows : "I solemnly declare
that I do not believe that all the heresies, sects, and factions, which the
ignorance, or wickedness of men has given birth to, were altogether so
disgraceful to man as a Christian philosopher, or statesman or citizen as
this abominable tenet .... but it is so vicious a tenet, so flattering to the
cruelty, the avarice and sordid selfishness of most men that I hardly know what
to think of the result."</p> 

<p>The immediate result was that the working class were stirred to 
the heart. The perfidy of the authors was the theme and incentive of 
the noble band who founded first the Working Men's Association and 
afterwards the Chartist Movement.</p> 

<p>The working class were ground down with taxation to pay the 
enormous debt incurred by their rulers in the liberticidal struggle with 
the French Republicans; they were the victims of a fiscal policy framed 
to fill the rapacious maws of place-hunters. Starvation stared them in 
the face, and whilst the country was being covered with railways, 
canals and mills, the results of the inventive brains of the Arkwrights, 
Stephensons and Fultons of Labour, there arose on every hand grim 
bastilles intended for their incarceration when broken down in the 
unequal struggle for life.</p> 

<p>Protests were not wanting against this cruelty ; the power and eloquence of
the working-class leaders were directed against its authors, and fierce and
threatening demonstrations were the consequence. The poetry of Elliott, the
fiery eloquence of Harney and O'Connor were allied with the patient work of
Lovett and the politic utterances of Sir Richard Phillips, to break down this
Law, but to no avail. And how do we stand to day in relation to this stupendous
crime committed against the most helpless, and at the same time most worthy,
section of the community, the struggling poor? They are crowded in thousands
within the hideous cheerless walls of the modem bastilles. Man and Wife
separated, imprisoned, deprived of liberty, fed upon food that is always coarse
and frequently rotten. Let us peer into these wards crowded with aged and
infirm men and women, and ask who are they who are condemned to pass the
remnants of their lives in these infernos ? They are the mothers, and fathers
of the working-class, who have by their toil contributed to make England's
commercial greatness.</p> 

<p>There is no system of torture but has its defenders, and it is fitting that
the peregrinating penny-a-liner of the D.T. who, as Ruskin has it, "pawns the
dirty linen of his soul in order that he may dine," should strive to whitewash
the workhouse system and prove its advantage to the poor ; but their employers
know better. At a Conference of Poor Law Guardians held in 1874, Reed declared
publicly, "That the Poor Law was not intended to be either humane or just, but
simply to give enough to preserve the life of the pauper" ; and they literally
interpret this, for in a workhouse not a hundred miles from the City Road, the
inmates greedily devour the offal intended for the pig-tub. The ordinary food
is unfit for human consumption. In some workhouses the inmates are deprived of
the visits of friends and liberty out for three and four months together, and
for the slightest infringement of the arbitrary rules are put in the Black Hole
or Oakum Sheds. In the latter they are frequently compelled to pick more oakum
than is allotted to felons within jails. In one the corpses of persons who die
in the infirmary, or the "stiff un's," as the officers elegantly term them, are
brought past the aged inmates as they sit in the "recreation " (sic) ground, I
suppose "pour encourager les autres" All inmates dread the infirmary, and with
good reasons, and will sooner hide their ailments than go into what is with
horror alluded to as "over there." For over there in the general sense means a
quick passage to the grave ; indeed a doctor told a patient, in a West End
workhouse, "You come here to die and not to live." In another, a woman in
child-labour was forced to scrub out a ward until too ill to rise.</p> 

<p>The cruel economy which has embittered and shortened their  
declining years, does not leave them in death. In Nottingham the coffins 
were so rotten that the bodies forced out the bottoms. Again, quite 
recently, in Clerkenwell, an undertaker spilt a load of dead paupers in 
the road, thus literally rattling their bones over the stones. A writer 
has spoken of the pauper's "tomb," but any cemetery gravedigger 
will tell you from what quarter of our public graveyards there comes 
into the public sewer the most noxious effluent ; it is from the pauper 
ditch where they are hurled together in a common grave. So much for 
Christian burial. A chalk mark, easily obliterated, has been thought 
sufficient name-plate, and hence it is a common occurrence for friends 
to mourn over the wrong coffins. Often a person dies in the infirmary 
and no notice is taken of the dying appeal to send for relatives and 
friends, and the body lies unclaimed in the dead house, and if not 
claimed is given over to the surgeon's knife. Of pauper lunatics I may 
have a word to say in the future.</p> 

<p>The streets in the vicinity of a metropolitan workhouse on a paupers 
outing, present a sad spectacle in illustration of our civilisation. Crowds 
of tottering men and women stream in different directions. Many, 
without friends or relatives or places to go to, wander aimlessly 
about, without food or pence, till it is time to re-enter their prisons. 
Woe to them, if late, for the sure punishment of the Oakum Shed and 
deprivation of future liberty awaits them. Striving to hide their 
detested uniform, others revisit the scenes of their poverty and struggles 
and beg a few pence and a meal from friends, whose lot will be 
soon as bad as their own. Aged couples, whose best years have been 
spent together, parted at the workhouse gate, re-unite outside and totter 
through the grim streets on a weary pilgrimage. Those who taunt us 
with seeking to dissolve family ties, should amend their hypocritical 
marriage service where it says, "Until death do us part : " and add, "Or 
the Relieving Officer."</p> 

<p>Let others talk of evolution and development, but I shall see with 
pleasure the dawn of a day of reckoning with these cowardly, cruel ill- 
treaters of the poor. Remember, that the class who have been most 
conspicuous for their brutality towards the unfortunate of our class are 
those who style themselves Liberals, philanthropists, and the friends of 
labour, who have erected the callous inhuman doctrines of Malthus into 
a science, and allude to your horror of receiving their cold charity as 
"wholesome dread of the 'House,'" and "an aid to thrift and industry."</p> 

<p>Those who are attracted to us from a sheer love of notoriety, and 
who in their previous careers never felt or sympathised with the poor, 
may from policy deprecate a cry for revenge. But the Socialist who looks 
forward to and works for the time when the worker's evening of life shall 
be passed in the enjoyment of what he has earned and produced with 
his fellows, cannot forego the desire and opportunity to reckon with 
those who bring the workers grey hairs in sorrow to the grave.</p>
