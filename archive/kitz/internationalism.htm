<h2>INTERNATIONALISM.</h2>

<p class="fst"> As the references to the starting of various associations in
"<a href="../morris/works/1886/sru/index.htm">Socialism from the Root-up</a> "
are necessarily brief, I desire as one who took a part in bringing together
English and foreign workers, to supplement them. If we select the period
immediately subsequent to the death of Robert Owen, we look upon a gloomy phase
of working-class history. Remnants of the great Chartist and Socialistic
agitations were following upon divergent roads the lead of Bronterre O'Brien
and Ernest Jones ; the former attacking the evils of landlordism, usury, and
profit, and proposing what might be termed a mixture of Individualism and
Socialism as a remedy, and the latter seeking through political Parliamentary
means to alleviate social ills. Away from these sincere men was a mass of what
may be termed the disbanded army of Chartist workers, men who probably were
never sincere in their temporary adhesion to the great principles put forward
during the previous great agitations, and now sought their own aggrandisement
at the expense of the people's Cause. All sorts of middle-class humbug was
upheld and preached by these renegades &mdash; Thrift, Emigration, National
Insurance, and Malthusianism &mdash; a host of bogus associations sprang into
existence for these several objects, and one or two middle-class saviours of
Society became general banker and treasurer to the whole ; our old friend
Samuel Morley might consider this a personal reference. How these fellows
scrambled for the middle-class gold thrown amidst them ! How they belittled the
great principles which they had formerly professed, and derided the enthusiasm
of young men who sought to carry those principles forward, is well known to
many who have pioneered the present Socialist revival.  
</p> 

<p> The birth of the International was a gleam of hope for the workers, but
even upon that body they intruded their presence ; sleek trade unionists, who
only believe in a corrupt aristocracy of labour and the " rights of those who
can get them," irrespective of those who are entitled to them, joined with the
aforesaid middle-class hacks in an hypocritical make-believe of adopting the
economic theories of Marx and the principles of universal emancipation.  But
whilst the English delegates were playing a role, the "foreigners" were in
earnest, and the Commune was proclaimed in Paris. It acted as a solvent upon
these members of the British Federation, and they hastened to assure their
patrons that they had no sympathy with violence, and a few belonging to that
curious combination known as the Workmen's Peace Party, chief product of
benefactor Morley, went to Paris and wept crocodile's tears over the effigy of
the executed Archbishop of Paris, and thus added insult to the injuries endured
by the martyr Parisian people in striving to prevent the re-imposition of the
shackles of Capitalism.  Favourable mention must be made of those members of
the Federation who did honour to the heroism of the Parisian workers, but their
enthusiasm could not withstand the dull apathy and hostility of the masses
&mdash; apathy in a large degree due to the spectacle of apostacy presented to
them. Their expiring effort was the formation of a club in 1873, which,
however, was short-lived, and the earlier celebrations of the Communist
uprising as a consequence were almost confined to foreigners resident in
London. The persistent efforts of the London refugees to establish relations
with English workmen resulted in a meeting of English, French, and Germans in
August, 1877, whereat a resolution was agreed to form an International Club,
and a few months saw its inauguration at Rose Street, Soho. I might record that
they had previously rendered generous service to the English Trades' Unionists
by causing the return of a large number of German masons, who, through the
misrepresentation of the employers, were inveigled over here during the famous
masons' strike. Their efforts were rewarded by the somewhile Internationalist
Broadhurst rushing into print to deny that the International had any hand in
the business. The passing of the Anti-Socialist Law in Germany crowded the
ranks with exiles, and clearly demonstrated the futility of lawful agitation
against despotism.  The sudden strain of supporting a mass of expatriated men,
women, and children was immense, but it was met and overcome. Suffice it to say
that outside of the few Englishmen comprising the English section, not one
penny of help did we receive. The Englishmen in association with this club now
commenced attacks upon the cant and humbug which the enemies of progress were
indulging in. Anti- Emigration meetings were held, whereat resolutions were
passed denouncing the monopolists and their tactics, and the unemployed were
stirred to resist the process of slow starvation. The execution of the Czar,
and the prosecution of Most for commenting upon this event in the German
<em>Freiheit</em>, together with the publication by the English section of a
manifesto and English edition of the <em>Freiheit</em>, drew general attention
to the principles of Socialism, and vastly aided their propagation. In this
light we might almost view ex-Home Secretary Harcourt as the putative father of
the present marvellous growth of our movement.  </p> 

<p> The initial meetings of the Social Democratic Federation were held at this
revolutionary and by that time Anarchist club, and although it may be very
inconsiderate of me to note this fact, as affecting the origin of those who are
not only painfully anxious to be considered a "purely English party, "but also
as the sole custodians of correct Socialist principles, to whom all others are
but their pupils and offshoots," (<em>vide Justice</em>), yet the truth must
out. The Germans, having by bitter experience been cured of Parliamentarianism,
the New English Party started with it, with what success the logic of events
may prove, but there were a few inside and outside of the new party who would
not wholly commit themselves to it on account of its Jingo Nationalism, and
still preserved their organisation intact, and to these are due the thousands
of Socialistic pamphlets, leaflets, and manifestos in circulation over the
country, the wherefrom of which has seriously troubled our "masters." </p> 

<p> The foundation of the "Radical," by S. Bennett, and the efforts of the
Anti-Coercion Association to prevent coercion in Ireland, was also contributory
to the birth of the "only English Party." In connection with Gladstone's
ill-starred coercive policy, there are one or two facts which show curiously
how English opinion is manufactured. Four trusty henchmen met over a friendly
glass and determined to go to the aid of the Grand Old Man, and forthwith there
was launched into existence the "Radical" League in support of the policy of
her Majesty's Government towards Ireland. One of the four, a reporter, under a
cloud for reporting an execution that never took place, had to work his "copy"
through another hand, and the morning papers contained lengthy reports of the
speeches which this precious gang made to one another, and Irishmen were
exasperated by what appeared to be an influential combination against them. One
of the historic four I see was among the seven who pretended to represent the
English working-class at the late International Trades' Congress, and as "a
fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind," he, of course, "warmly protested"
against the attack made upon his fellow-Coercionist Broadhurst by the German
delegate. The game of representation which he and others have played for so
many years, and the formation of bogus political associations chiefly around
the neigh bourhood of Clerkenwell, is now doomed by the advance of Socialism.
Whilst in reality they have only represented a narrow clique in a special
craft, as another delegate truly told them, the Aristocracy of Labour, they
have presumed on all occasions to speak in the name of the great mass of the
English workers, a position for which they have as much right to as the man in
the moon. To talk of German competition whilst Englishmen are forcing their
goods upon millions of people at the point of the bayonet, is like pot calling
the kettle black, and is a stupid and mischievous contribution to the
discussion of Social Economics.  </p> 

<p> The toilers and moilers in the sweltering back slums of our cities and
towns, who get their hand-to-mouth existence in ways that Burnett and Co.
neither wot of nor care about, and even the over-worked unionist who sees his
combination powerless to repress the growing power of Capitalism, and only
useful in saving the pockets of the exploiters from poor rates, and to increase
the cost of living and rent to himself and others, may well question whether
the Socialist or the paid Union Delegate best represents the full interest of
Labour.  </p> 

<p> Mr.  Burnett's sneer as to the fact of his being able to speak without fear
of imprisonment falls flat, for he and his fellows would run no risk of im-
prisonment, even in despotic Germany, for acting gratuitously as relieving
officers for the middle-class. But if, instead of talking cant, he fought the
true battle of Labour with Monopoly, he might And himself fined or imprisoned
even in "dear" Albion &mdash; Mainwaring and Williams to wit. However, he and
his confreres have their reward. That slimy product of our modern capitalist
system, viz., the anonymous scribbler of the Hebrew Money-jobber Daily Press,
belauds them, and this, together with the small jobs which their close friends
the Parliamentary Whigs are sure to give them, will constitute a sufficient
recompense for the trials and tribulations endured at the Congress.  </p>

<p> The German delegates' references to the Conservatism and indifference of
the English workers to the root question of whether Labour shall be the slave
or the master in Society are particularly true, and whilst we must regret that
the present Socialist upheaval is more due to the failure of English Capitalism
to still afford wages to its slaves than to spontaneous generous impulse on the
part of the workers, we know that the movement now growing will not recede, and
that the glorious band of men and women who dreamed dreams of Universal
Freedom, and fought and died for their realisation, will receive just
recognition by the establishment of an International Federation of the wealth
producers. <em>Frank Kitz.</em> </p>
