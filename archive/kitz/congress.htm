<h2>PARIS CONGRESS.</h2>

<h2>DELEGATE'S REPORT.</h2>

<p class="fst">
The first proceeding after the verification of credentials was the calling 
over the list of delegates, most of whom answered the roll in French, 
German, and English. The only incident worthy of mention during this 
tedious process was the applause with which the names of Peter Lavroff 
(Russia), Cipriani (Italy), and that of Dr. Adler the Austrian delegate 
(now sentenced to four months' imprisonment, to be undergone upon 
his return), and the Danish delegation, were greeted. These last had 
been sent at the last moment, the Danish Social-Democrats having 
altered their previous intention not to participate in the Congress. 
Several fresh adhesions during the sittings brought up the total of 
delegates to 407. The English representation, consisting of 21 at the 
outset of the business, was increased to 24 by the arrival of J. and R. 
Turner and F. Charles subsequently. The proportions of the English 
delegation from the Socialist League were : Council of two delegates ; 

and branches nine in all. It is worthy of remark that Greece, 
Norway, Bulgaria, Roumania, Finland, Portugal, and the Czechs were 
represented. Scotland may properly be said to have been represented 
by Messrs. Keir Hardie, Ayrshire Miners ; Ogilvy, Scottish Labour 
Association; Cunninghame Graham and Halliday. These, in conjunction 
with our comrade Wess of the Berner Street Club, were the other 
elements in the delegation from Britain. 
</p>
<p>
The best part of two days was wasted in a useless discussion promoted 
by the Italian and Flemish delegates in favour of a fusion with 
the other Congress, which ended as described in my fellow-delegate's 
(Morris's) report. The reports of various nations and trades consumed 
the time until Saturday morning, when the proposals in favour of 
international legislation, eight hours per day, regulation and inspection 
of factories, and other " stepping stones " were brought forward. The 
League delegates held a special meeting to discuss their attitude 
towards these proposals, and as there was a diversity of opinion as to 
the course we should pursue, it was left to the discretion of each 
delegate to vote as he pleased. 
</p>
<p>
The position occupied by myself, and some others of the delegates, 
in regard to the question of seeking the aid of Parliament for the 
reduction of the hours of labour, was that it should be achieved by 
strikes, combination, and by custom, for the reasons given in Merlino's 
amendment : &mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Considering that it is dangerous to foster amongst the masses the great 
superstition of the century, which consists in pretending to solve the great 
social problems by the ballot box and Acts of Parliament ; that it is on the 
contrary necessary to undermine and destroy the fetishes of legislation and 
legislators ; and that the offer of labour legislation officially made by the 
governments has only one aim, that of rehabilitating in the eyes of the 
masses Parliamentarism, now becoming utterly discredited, and to prolong 
its agonising life." 
</p>
<p>
The reading of the reports occupied several hours, during which 
it was necessary to sit in a cramped position and listen to them in 
French and German before the English translation was reached. This 
made it a wearisome task, the irksomeness of which was increased by 
the several presidents and prominent members of the bureau, who took 
little or no trouble to secure order for the English translations. Many 
valuable portions of the reports and names of the speakers in several 
cases were inaudible to me on this account. Mrs. Aveling laboured 
hard and conscientiously at a very hard task, but had to solicit the 
aid of your delegates' lungs to assist her in obtaining anything like silence 
for her explanations. I must say, as against the French character 
for courtesy, that the local Parisian delegates were as a group the 
most discourteous in this particular, and were several times rebuked 
from the platform for it. 
</p>
<p>
The portions of reports which I think most noteworthy are those of 
the Parisian Waiters, French Seamen, German Westphalian Miners, 
Berlin Women Workers, Swedish, Danish, and Austrian delegates. 
Comrade Clara Zetkin, of the Berlin Women Workers, roused the 
Congress to enthusiasm when she said that the capitalist had destroyed 
women's place at home and forced her into the market as a producer, 
only to widen her ideas and create another enemy who would strive 
with energy for the overthrow of capitalist domination. She said that 
little thanks were due to the men for women's awakening, for they 
have held that women's place was at home as a domestic slave. The 
women would never return to that condition ; but, in opposition to 
the middle-class agitation for so-called Women's Rights, which simply 
means to put women in antagonism to men and use them as competitors 
in the wage-market against them, they women Socialists, disregarding 
the question of sex in economics, would work with men on a basis of 
equality for the social revolution. 
</p>
<p>
Dr. Adler, Austria, in giving his report, stated that in Austria 
labour legislation was theoretically perfect. Regulation of factories 
and of child and female labour existed on paper, yet men, women, and 
children are overworked and the laws disregarded. In a speech full 
of satire he ridiculed this state of things, and said that for his 
participation in the tram strike of Vienna his paper, the Gleichheit, 
was suppressed and himself condemned to prison ; that in all Austria there are 
only fifteen inspectors to see to the enforcement of labour laws. 
</p>
<p>
The delegate of the Parisian Waiters' stated that they had to work 
from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m., and often longer ; that they often had to pay 
the managers of the Bureau de Placement, or place farmers, 60 ft. to 
100 fr. to secure a place, and then were frequently dismissed upon the 
smallest pretence, the employer and the bureau sharing in the plunder 
of the guarantee. They were obliged to be civil to all, and even when 
insulted to say " Thank you." Hitherto they had been counted as of 
no moment, but now that they are organised every other section of 
industry recognised them. They were heartily in sympathy with 
Socialism. 
</p>
<p>
The delegate of the German Miners' recited how the miners had 
been treated by the authorities in their late revolt, and how many 
had been imprisoned for simply organising ; of their interview with 
the German Emperor, whom, by the way, he designated "the devil"; 
and said, in conclusion, that the upheaval had been made without 
Socialist influence against intolerable conditions, but henceforward the 
miners would work with socialistic aims. 
</p>
<p>
Sweden was obliged to seek a Swede resident in Paris as her representative, 
because just now there are four editors of Socialist papers 
in prison, and exceptional laws on the German and Austrian pattern 
are being passed against the Socialists. 
</p>
<p>
Bohemian Socialists were also under the same difficulties ; no combination 
was allowed, and just recently in one year 340 persons were 
arrested on suspicion, some condemned to one year of imprisonment 
for a paper that had ceased to exist, some to three or four months, 
and only 110 acquitted after being detained weeks without trial. 
</p>
<p>
The delegate of the French Seamen detailed the hardships his constituents 
underwent, tied up by the hands to the rigging or placed in 
dark cells, and overworked and half starved. He appealed to the 
Congress for its sympathy and aid on their behalf. 
</p>
<p>
Christensen, of Denmark, gave his report, and spoke of the rapid 
strides the movement was making in that country, and of the persecutions 
to which the Socialists were subjected. 
</p>
<p>
Ferroul (Deputy) asked to be allowed to speak, and having obtained 
permission he delivered a powerful speech against Parliamentarianism. 
</p>
<p>
The English report was given upon anti-Parliamentary lines by 
comrade Morris, and after a deal of pressure had been exercised upon 
the bureau <a href="#footnote1">1</a>.  
</p>
<p>
Keir Hardie gave us a trades' union report, at the conclusion of 
which he went out of his way to declare that no person in England 
believed in other than peaceful methods to achieve amelioration of 
conditions, a statement that was protested against by myself and other 
delegates. Hardie's speech was carefully, very carefully, translated 
into German by Liebknecht, who in the course of it added oomments 
of his own to demonstrate the difference between Morris and Keir 
Hardie <a href="#footnote2">2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The subsequent sittings of the Congress were devoted to the factory 
legislation before mentioned, and a resolution sent in on behalf of the 
League by Morris was added, I believe, to the preamble of the first 
resolution. 
</p>
<p>
I then essayed my prentice hand in the belief that the wreckage 
caused by competition deserve as much attention as the organised 
workers, and therefore sent in the following resolution : &mdash;
</p>
<p>
" The Congress recognising that the monopoly of the means of life, viz., 
land and instruments of production, by landlords and capitalists is the 
cause of poverty and degradation amongst the masses, and seeing that the 
mass of unemployed caused by monopoly have only the choice of either 
starvation wages, brutal charity, theft, or rebellion, we view with disgust 
and horror the hypocrisy which establishes a code of morality and honesty, 
buttressed by religion, and yet condemns multitudes to pauperism, prostitution, and crime ; the Congress having for its aim and object the extinction 
of poverty by the abolition of monopoly, declares that the monopolists who 
enforce judicially penal law are themselves the greatest criminals, and whilst 
extending our sympathy to prisoner, prostitute, and pauper, made so by 
injustice, we strengthen our resolve to overthrow at the earliest moment the 
fraud called Modern Society." 
</p>
<p>
Considerable trouble had to be taken to get it read to the Congress, 
after which it was, I believe, consigned to limbo. No attempt was 
made to translate it for the convenience of the delegates, nor put it 
upon the order of the day. 
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, I must say that the Congress was disappointing from 
a revolutionary standpoint, badly organised, and little more than a 
prelude to the Governmental one about to be held upon labour legislation. 
Discussion upon the anti-Parliamentary and Anarchical positions 
was barely tolerated, and ultimately, forcibly suppressed. Let me say 
that as a demonstration of Internationalism broadly, and not noticing 
details, the Congress was a success ; but my advice to English Socialists 
Is, in view of a convocation to another one to be held in the future, to 
insist upon organisation, such as the printing of the order of the day, 
proper translations, and above all, sound revolutionary doctrines in 
favour of all and not sections of the proletariat. <em>F. Kitz.</em>

<p class="endnote">Notes: [G.Seaman]<br />
<a id="footnote1" name="footnote1">1</a>. A note appeared in the September 14 issue of Commonweal as follows:<br />
<br />
We have received the first part of the official edition of the proceedings of
the International (Marxist) Congress (23 pp., Imprimerie de la Resse, 1889),
containing the appeal of the organising committee, the list of delegates, and a
number of resolutions passed. Very little care has been taken, to make this
publication a reliable historical document, for the lists of delegates swarm
with misprints, omissions, and inconsequent arrangings. Two of the English
delegates, F. Charles and J. Turner, are completely omitted ; on the other side
we find an Austrian delegate, Mr. Altrohla<em>n</em>, who never existed, but
the name of the town of Altrohla<em>u</em>, where H. Dietel came from, was made
the name of a delegate ! William Morris's and F. Kitz's resolutions were not
published as " no space was left," it is said, but will be published " later
on."<br />
<br />
<a id="footnote2" name="footnote2">2</a>. Leibknecht's reply was published in the  next issue of Commonweal as follows:<br />
<br />
Sir, &mdash; In your number of the 10th of this month, Mr. F. Kitz pays me the 
compliment of having "carefully, very carefully translated into German 
Keir Hardie's speech." Mr. Kitz is right. I did it "carefully, very carefully," as I am always wont to do my duty. Since Mr. Kitz has omitted to 
mention it, I may add that I have translated Mr. Morris's speech with 
exactly the same care and love ; and if Mr. Kitz had made a speech as 
interesting and as instructive as those of his two countrymen, I should have 
rendered him the same service. &mdash; Truly yours, W. Liebknecht.<br />
<br />
Borsdorf, near Leipzig, August 11.<br />
