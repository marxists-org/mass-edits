<h2>OUR CIVILISATION:  THE JERRY BUILDER.</h2> 

<p>In utilising the space at my disposal for this paper I do not 
concern myself with advocacy of the abstract principles of 
Socialism, but prefer to exhibit the foulness, discomfort and 
filth which capitalism inflicts upon us in our every-day lives, 
and thus negatively to make Socialism understood. The utility 
and justification of this gospel of discontent is found in the 
patience with which the people bear the evils which the gushing 
scribes of the press assure them are inseparable from "Our 
Civilisation."</p> 

<p>One, and by no means the least weighty of the counts in 
the indictments by which Socialists arraign the present system 
of production for profit, is that wherein our health and lives are 
directly affected, viz., the construction of our houses, owing to 
our infamous land system, which robs the people of their natural 
inheritance and forces them into towns ; we have, especially 
in London, a vast increase of urban population. To meet this 
artificially-created and unnatural increase, our fields, and ere-while 
pleasure resorts, have been given over to the reign of the 
Jerry Builder, who has disfigured them with miles of hideousness. 
Under his sway, trees, grass and hedgerow disappear, 
the pleasant wayside brook becomes a noisome sewer, villages 
are reached, swallowed up and passed. What few characteristics 
of their once rural environment remain, only stand as sad 
mementoes of a simple past, and soon degenerate into slums. 
Over the poor man's common the Jerry Builder casts a greedy 
eye, and thereon builds his shoddy houses for the shoddy City 
plutocrat, who, true to his instincts of shop, designates the few 
starveling soot-beladen stalks which his friend the Jerry 
Builder has allowed to remain around his house as the "Grove" 
"Shrubberies," "Sylvania," etc. The poor mourn the loss of 
their open spaces, once within a stone's throw of their homes ; 
the Sunday walk in the fields is now replaced by a sojourn in 
the sweltering gin palaces. Wages are falling, rent is rising, 
and the railway trip to the country is out of their reach. As the 
circle widens and the oxygen-giving trees and grass recede 
before the march of the invader, and are replaced by smoky 
chimnies, sulphurous brickfields, and dust-heaps, so does the 
atmosphere of the huge city become vitiated and enervating, 
the poor penned and overcrowded are literally asphyxiated, and 
killed by hundreds through the lung diseases set up by these 
causes. Glorious civilisation ! how apropos are the burning 
words of Rouget De Lisle in the "Marseillaise," "They mete and 
vend the light and air."</p> 

<p>The Press, actuated by the same benevolent principles toward Land Jobbers
which prompts their articles in favor of colonial emigration, advise the
working class to seek "fresh air" by living in the suburbs and renting those
"Desirable Residences " constructed by the Jerry Builders.</p> 

<p>The evidence given before the Commission to inquire into the Building Acts
throws a clear light on the manner in which our suburbs are run up. Dr. Tripe,
medical officer for Hackney, deposed that he knew whole streets and roads that
were built upon foundations composed of the filth and refuse of dust-bins, the
soil having been excavated to a depth of ten feet or more and replaced with the
refuse from dust-yards, and the builder commences proceedings by announcing
that "Rubbish may be shot here." The houses themselves were constructed with
road- drift and street-sludge mixed with inferior mortar. Anent the sludge, he
explained that it contained a large amount of sewage and faecal matter. The
general evidence was to the effect that the houses so constructed decrease the
health, and in large numbers of cases actually cause the death, of their
inmates.  Many were so flagrantly bad in construction that, despite the
collusion between parish officials, landlords and builders, they were
condemned. Others saved them trouble by falling down from their own weakness.
This has happened with detached houses; when built together, they have
supported each other as two inebriates do by leaning against each other. All
this has not gone on without some protest. Occasionally some remnant of open
space, from which natural beauty is riven, is snatched from the devouring grasp
of the land-grabber, and the public are made to pay handsome compensation for
the exercise of their own rights.</p>

<p>Lovers of art like Matthew Arnold and Ruskin declaim against the rampant
spoliation of Nature, and Ruskin queries whether the "Greatness of the British
Empire is as loosely stuck in the ground as are the houses of its
inhabitants." Scientists like Richardson formulate a City of Health and teach
sanitary truths, but they reckon without their host. The same cause, which make
the filthy reeking slums of tbe central districts "profitable investments
of capitalists and others" as per advertisement of highly-respectable
auctioneers, is at work in the newer quarters. Rent &mdash; that corner-stone
of the whole system &mdash; packs humanity together as a source of exploitation
by this form of robbery. The causes of physical and moral degration, so rife
amongst us, are fast lowering the morale and physique of the people. We are
told that we are advancing in the path of civilisation. If it involves loss of
health, of happiness and culture to us as workers, <em>Cui bono?</em> Time was
when the homes of a people betokened their degree of culture, when art and
architecture were allied, and were not the handmaidens of greedy speculators;
when masonry was an honourable craft, not forced to create the hideous
eccentricities which disfigure pur thoroughfares to-day. The monuments of the
past still with us prove this. If it is left to our posterity, when freed from
the rent fiend, to develop the Socialistic ideas now leavening the mass, and to
give them concrete expression in the construction of their houses and
surroundings, we may gauge the feelings with which they will view the paltry
remnants of our present ugliness, if any remain, of an age which fostered
sanitation in its hospitals and prisons, and neglected it in its houses; gauge
the ridicule they will bestow upon the brick boxes in which we exist as the
reductio ad absurdum of individualism gone mad, of a people puzzled how to feed
and house their own poor, yet striving to force Arabs to live their lives ; and
as they till their communal lands and enjoy their communal halls, they will
bless those who now are hastening the end of the reign of Shoddy.</p>
