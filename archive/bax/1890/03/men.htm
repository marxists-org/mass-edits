<p class="fst">Dear Comrade, &#8211; Kindly allow me, if rather late in the day, a word of protest against the form of the Russian resolution of Sunday week. Surely it was somewhat inept that a resolution on behalf of a movement that has been specially characterised by the mutual and equal cooperation of the sexes should have been gratuitously twisted into a piece of advocacy of modern sex-privilege. Were the framers and supporters of the resolution, who so carefully and guardedly confined their protest to the case of women, really indifferent to the barbarities inflicted on other prisoners who happened to have committed the crime of being born men It certainly looked very much like it. There must surely have been some &#8220;advanced&#8221; women present, and that not one should have had the decency to propose an amendment substituting the simple word &#8220;prisoners&#8221; for &#8220;women&#8221; speaks volumes as to the self-respect of such women, and especially for the sincerity of their advocacy of &#8220;equality&#8221; between the sexes.</p>
