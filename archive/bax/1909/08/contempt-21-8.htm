<p class="fst">DEAR COMRADE, &#8211; According to the official report of the S.D.P. Conference at Bristol, Mr Herbert Burrows characterised my &#8220;methods&#8221; of opposing female suffrage as &#8220;contemptible.&#8221; Coming from the source it did, this remark as originally made might not have been worth noticing: but, having been reproduced in the report in question, I feel called upon to demand of Mr. Burrows either a justification or a withdrawal.</p>

<p>What he means I am at a loss to understand, save that my arguments and facts have proved extremely inconvenient to the class of feminist propaganda with which he has identified himself. Or are my &#8220;methods&#8221; deemed &#8220;contemptible&#8221; because I have not followed the &#8220;methods&#8221; of some Feminists that I know, and resorted to unscrupulous lying in order to deceive a public ignorant of the law, and unversed in the way it is administered? If so, I can only plead that I not made that way, and, moreover, that the cause I champion has no need of such heroic methods as these. It only requires a plain statement of the truth.</p>
