<p class="fst">The &#8220;parade&#8221; at St. Paul&#8217;s, on Sunday, was certainly a success from the point of view of the promoters. It was a demonstration, and an effective one in a sense. But the propriety of church parades is a question upon which divergent opinions may be, and are, held by Socialists. On the one hand, it is argued that any sort of &#8220;demonstration&#8221;, irrespective of its importance or character, is productive of good. On the other hand, there are those who, like myself, fail to see the special gain in inducing a body of 100, or 150 men to waste a fine Sunday morning, on which useful Socialist meetings might be held, within the four walls of a church. Surely there should be either one of two things. If it is intended to &#8220;demonstrate&#8221; against the present organisation of society through that &#8220;religion&#8221; (so-called) which holds such a prominent place in it, then the only logical procedure would be to go in such force to the &#8220;place of worship&#8221; selected, as to be able to supplant the parson and convert the quondam &#8220;service&#8221; into a Socialist meeting. But to proceed to church with the determination to &#8220;sit out&#8221; the morning performance with all the air of devout worshippers, I must confess seems to me to be a somewhat aimless proceeding. I do not think the logical alternative referred to would be worth its &#8220;candle&#8221; of subsequent prosecution at least at present, so my opinion of &#8220;church parades&#8221; is &#8220;don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
