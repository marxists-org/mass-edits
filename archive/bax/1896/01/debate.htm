<p class="fst">DEAR COMRADE, &#8211; By a misprint the last paragraph of my <a href="ethics.htm" target="new">letter anent Leatham</a> in last week&#8217;s issue is made unintelligible. I wrote, &#8220;One alternative <em>never</em> seems to have occurred to our comrade Leatham.&#8221; This you have rendered, &#8220;One alternative <em>now</em> seems,&#8221; &amp;c., thus reversing the sense.</p>

<p>As regards Mr. O&#8217;Fallon, he must excuse me for saying that I don&#8217;t think any useful purpose, moral or material, would he subserved by a discussion with him such as he proposes. Especially since, if yourself, &#8220;Tattler,&#8221; and the present writer have, as he says, &#8220;jointly and severally&#8221; failed to make clear to him the simple issue he mentions, I am &#8220;reluctantly compelled&#8221; to regard his case as hopeless. Certainly I cannot undertake to state this particular point more clearly than I have done already on more than one occasion &#8211; e.g., in my last <strong>Justice</strong> letter on the &#8220;Woman Question.&#8221; &#8211; yours fraternally,</p>
