<p class="fst">DEAR COMRADE,</p>

<p class="fst">In reply to the letter of Mr. Billy Johnson, in your issue of February 2, permit me to say that my recollection of the communication of his of a year ago, which he refers to, is that after reading it, I remained as wise as before as to the drift of his argument. I hope I duly recognised the brilliant corruscations of wit it contained, but they were, I suppose, too dazzling for my poor vision to pierce through to the wisdom behind. Under these circumstances I felt hardly in a position to answer his letter.</p>

<p>I thought I had exposed the fallacy of the silly controversial &#8220;tag&#8221; in question clearly and conclusively both in <strong>Justice</strong> and in my article in the last number of the <strong>Social-Democrat</strong>, bit if Mr. Billy Johnson thinks otherwise and is really yearning for any little light I might be able to afford him on the subject; as he implies, perhaps he will kindly give me his objections to my argument in plain language unadorned by feathers, bladders, negroes, white-skinned babies and such-like recondite tropes so hard to be comprehended by a person of mere plain understanding, like myself. If <em>he</em> will do this <em>I</em> will, in my poor way, attempt to satisfy him.</p>

<p>As regards &#8220;Ignoramus&#8217;s&#8221; rejoinder in your current issue, I must emphatically disclaim any intention of being discourteous to him. I merely referred to his signature as having been selected either &#8220;in truth or <em>modesty</em>.&#8221; More I could scarcely say, being absolutely ignorant of the personality concealed by it. Certainly, to describe an opinion as &#8220;tommy-rot&#8221; is not argument, but it is just as little argument to designate it a &#8220;fad&#8221;; while the latter epithet, I was contending, is not merely rude or untrue in intention, but etymologically incorrect in any case where the subject in question is of far-reaching importance.</p>

<p>At the same time, It is difficult to characterise in parliamentary language such a statement as that &#8220;female slavery&#8221; (on a sex basis) exists! Feminists should really have a care how far they try the patient credulity even of their dupes, let alone of average men of the world.</p>

<p>By the way, a good sample of the quality of feminist &#8220;wit&#8221; is afforded in another column of <strong>Justice</strong>, where a meeting is reported in which the chairman, having given expression to a commonplace truism, but which was supposed to be derogatory to &#8220;woman,&#8221; was met on the part of another speaker (capable of better things), by way of repartee, with a perfectly irrelevant personal reference to the baldness of his (the chairman&#8217;s) head! This brilliant and tasteful sally was received apparently with rapturous applause by the feminist audience. Amiable creatures, who can be amused so easily. &#8211; Yours,</p>
