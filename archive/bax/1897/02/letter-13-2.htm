<p class="fst">DEAR COMRADES, The attempt at &#8220;bluff&#8221; made by Herbert Burrows anent the <strong>Legal Subjection</strong> pamphlet in your issue of January 30 will certainly deceive no one. A confident attitude is the last and only resource of a man in straits when all other weapons fail him.</p>

<p>It seems, from Burrow&#8217;s letter, that my information was correct as to the prohibition of discussion at a feminist meeting at which he was the speaker, though his explanation and exculpation of himself in the matter will, <em>of course</em>, be gladly accepted.</p>

<p>In Burrow&#8217;s opinion, it would appear that to publish a statement of law and fact without, appending the name is to be an &#8220;anonymous reviler.&#8221; However this may be, I, who am, perhaps, rather &#8220;nominous&#8221; in this question than otherwise, am always willing and anxious to &#8220;come out into the open.&#8221; Burrows a surmise as to the improbability of my presence at 337, Strand, on February 28 (based, as it probably was, on authentic information as to my topographical position) being correct, I feel it incumbent upon me to make him the same offer I made Mrs. Aveling more than a year ago. I therefore challenge him to meet me in a written debate on this question. Should he accept I shall &#8220;have the pleasure of showing him&#8221; that statements anent the position of woman, published in <strong>Justice</strong> and elsewhere as having been made by him, and which have certainly remained uncontradicted by him, are <em>lies</em> (I say nothing about &#8220;deliberate&#8221; lying, because I do not like to be rude). Burrows does not state whether his &#8220;refusal&#8221; to discuss, this question in the columns of <strong>Justice</strong> extends to other publications (say, for example, the new Social-Democrat) though I rather suspect it does. For I have observed that nothing horrifies a controversial feminist so much as black and white. The old &#8220;tags&#8221; and sentimental &#8220;wheezes&#8221; which, when spoken, bring plaudits from an audience just as snuff brings sneezing, the traditional devices for evading the issue &#8211; all these little dodges &#8220;won&#8217;t work&#8221; so well when translated into the cold medium of type, However, I make my offer, whether it be accepted or not.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I congratulate Barrows on the probability of his being capable of proving successfully on the 28th certain discrepancies between the law as stated by the &#8220;Two Barristers&#8221; and the law as expounded in that copy of Blackstone (!), which I am told, he carries in his bag on these occasions. On this basis he will be doubtless able to &#8220;show the rogues they lied&#8221; to the satisfaction of every sympathetic devotee of female domination in his audience, and I wish him joy of the cheers which will, as doubtless, be meted out to him in consequence.</p>
