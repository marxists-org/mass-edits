<p class="fst">Dear Comrades, &#8211; Comrade Aldred&#8217;s reply to the somewhat stale exhortation conveyed under the above query leaves little to be desired. It so happens that the <strong>Neue Zeit</strong> for August 4, contains an article by a German comrade (H. Salzmann) on the same subject, and to much the same effect. There seems to be a growing sentiment in the German Party that the favourite &#8220;tag,&#8221; that &#8220;religion is a private matter,&#8221; will have to be taken with a very considerable grain of salt, The phrase undoubtedly often covers an unworthy and somewhat hypocritical shirking of a necessary question &#8211; and, moreover, for the most part a perfectly useless one. In spite of the attempts sometimes made, no-one is really deceived into thinking that Socialism is compatible with any of the traditional systems of dogma termed religions. Thus, the old &#8220;tag&#8221; is in short a conventional lie, and surely the of these conventional lies we can do with the better When we find persons calling themselves Socialists like Mr. Ramsay MacDonald trying to make themselves &#8220;practical,&#8221; with Nonconformist voters and the like, by protesting their zeal for the &#8220;religious&#8221; indoctrination of children as an apology for their advocacy of secular education, I think it is about time for the thorough-going Socialist or Social-Democrat of the S.D.F to think twice before entrenching himself on the &#8220;Why attack religion?&#8221; attitude. Modern religion, like modern politics, is a part of the modern capitalist system &#8211; one of the wings of the vampire (cf. Walter Crane&#8217;s well-known cartoon) &#8211; Yours,</p>
