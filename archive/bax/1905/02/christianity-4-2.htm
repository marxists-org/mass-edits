<p class="fst">Dear COMRADE, &#8211; Our friend Hunter Watts evidently forgets that I did not raise this question at the present juncture. It was raised, I submit, in an unnecessarily aggressive manner, by S.A.R. In his international &#8220;note.&#8221; One may be prepared, for the time being at least, not to raise an issue oneself, but this does not mean one is therefore prepared to let statements pass made by other people, statements which one holds to be faulty or dangerous in principle.</p>

<p>Hunter Watts finds theological dogma beautiful apparently, although he doesn&#8217;t believe in its truth. There is no greater admirer of legend and folklore than myself, but I for my part prefer it in its pristine shape, and not as degraded and distorted by civilised theology with false history and ugly dogma.</p>

<p>With reference to comrade Maxted&#8217;s letter, I will only say here that I am quite prepared to give my reasons in detail for regarding Socialism and Christianity as incompatible on a suitable occasion, but the columns of <strong>Justice</strong> would perhaps hardly be a fitting place.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that in the same issue of <strong>Justice</strong> containing the two letters in question, is a front-page &#8220;note&#8221; headed <em>Religious Mania</em> which I think might give our comrades &#8220;pause&#8221; who are so very cocksure about the religious (or theological) question being so absolutely immaterial to Socialist propaganda. In this &#8220;note&#8221; you have admirably pointed out the effects of fervent theological faith (for it is after all nothing more than this) in Wales on social and political interests. &#8211; Yours fraternally,</p>
