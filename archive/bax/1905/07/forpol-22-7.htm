<p class="fst">DEAR COMRADE,</p>

<p class="fst">I do hope you will enlighten us as to the &#8220;splendid services&#8221; referred to in last week&#8217;s first &#8220;note,&#8221; of your hero Delcass&#233; &#8211; services of which you say our French comrades were not sufficiently mindful. One would have thought the &#8220;interview&#8221; recently published in the <strong>Gaulois</strong> would have effectually disillusioned even such half-baked Delcass&#233; worshippers as yourself. M. Delcass&#233; did not beat about the bush his cynical and, in style, quite Machiavellian, declaration of commercial advantage as the end of all foreign policy, or in his cold-blooded confession of having schemed to inveigle Britain into a Russian alliance &#8211; a nice character assuredly for Socialist panegyric! But then M. Delcass&#233; was against Germany, which, I suppose, atones for all sins!</p>

<p>You may, of course, be in the right, but for my part I say, &#8220;Preserve us from the foreign policy of the British Socialist movement sinking to the level of the mere anti-Germanism of the <strong>Daily Mail</strong> and <strong>Daily Express</strong>.&#8221; &#8211; Yours,</p>
