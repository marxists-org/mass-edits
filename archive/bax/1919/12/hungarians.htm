<p class="fst">Dear Comrades, &#8211; &#8220;R.T.H.&#8221; in the review of <strong>Nationalities in Hungary</strong> reasserts the old theory, which I thought entirely exploded, that the modern Hungarians or Magyars are descended from &#8220;Attila&#8217;s Huns.&#8221; It is true the Magyars, like the Turks, speak the &#8220;Ugrian&#8221; or, as it used to be called, &#8220;Turanian&#8221; language; but physically they have no Mongolian characteristics. Attila&#8217;s Huns, according to all the contemporary authorities &#8211; Priscus, Ammianus, Marcellinus, and Jordanes &#8211; were typical Mongolian savages with squat figures, high cheekbones, round shoulders, and beardless cheeks: characteristics the very opposite to those of the tall, well-shaped, good-looking Magyar people. The latter, as we all know, arrived in Hungary from the East at the end of the ninth century, and their only connection with Attila&#8217;s Huns would surely seem to consist in the fact that they settled in a territory which Attila&#8217;s Huns had occupied more than four centuries before, but from which they seem to have shortly after dispersed. &#8211; Yours fraternally,</p>
