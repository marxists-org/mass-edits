<h2><a name="h1">[Introduction]</a></h2>

<p class="fst">We have tried to show<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
that socialism is nothing other than people's conscious self-organization of 
their own lives in all domains; that it signifies, therefore, the management of 
production by the producers themselves on the scale of the workplace as well as 
on that of the economy as a whole; that it implies the abolition of every ruling 
apparatus separated from society; that it has to bring about a profound 
modification of technology and of the very meaning of work as people's 
primordial activity and, conjointly, an overthrow of all the values toward which 
capitalist society implicitly or explicitly is oriented.</p>

<p class="fst">This elaboration allows us in the first place to unmask the 
mystifications that have been built up for many long years around the notion of 
socialism. It allows us to understand first of all what socialism is not. Cast 
in this light, Russia, China, and the "popular democracies" show their true face 
as exploitative class societies. With respect to the present discussion at 
least, the fact that bureaucrats have taken the place of private employers 
appears to be of absolutely no consequence.</p>

<p class="fst">But it allows us to say much more. Only by beginning with this 
notion of socialism can we comprehend and analyse the crisis of contemporary 
society. Going beyond the superficial spheres of the market, consumption, and 
"politics," we can see now that this crisis is directly tied to the most 
deep-seated trait of capitalism: the alienation of man in his fundamental 
activity, productive activity. Insofar as this alienation creates a permanent 
conflict at every stage and in all sectors of social life, there is a crisis of 
exploitative society. This conflict is expressed in two forms: both as the 
workers' struggle against alienation and against its conditions, and as people's 
absence from society, their passivity, discouragement, retreat, and isolation. 
In both cases, beyond a certain point this conflict leads to the overt crisis of 
the established society: when people's struggle against alienation reaches a 
certain intensity it becomes revolution. But when their abstention from society 
goes beyond a certain limit, the system collapses, as the evolution of Poland's 
economy and society in 1955 and 1956 clearly shows.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> 
Oscillating between these two limits, there unfolds daily life in modern 
societies. These societies succeed in functioning only in spite of their own 
norms, inasmuch as there is struggle against alienation and inasmuch as this 
struggle does not go beyond a certain level. Such societies therefore are based 
on a fundamentally irrational premise.</p>

<p class="fst">In resuming our analysis of the crisis of capitalism, we start 
therefore with an explicit notion of the content of socialism. This notion is 
the privileged centre, the focal point that permits us to organize all 
perspectives and to see everything again with new eyes. Without it, everything 
becomes chaos, fragmentary statements, naive relativism, mere empirical 
sociology.</p>

<p class="fst">But this is not an a priori notion. The proletariat's struggle 
against alienation and its conditions can take place and develop only by setting 
forth - be it in the shape of real relations between people, be it in the shape 
of demands, aspirations, and programs - forms and contents of a socialist 
nature. Consequently, the positive notion of socialism is only the historical 
product of preceding developments, and in the very first place, of the activity, 
the struggles, and the mode of living of the proletariat in modern society. It 
is the provisional systematisation of the points of view that the history of the 
proletariat offers, of its most everyday gestures as well as its most ambitious 
actions.</p>

<p class="fst">In a shop, the workers set things up among themselves in order to 
make the maximum amount in bonuses as well as to produce less than the norms. In 
Budapest, they battle against Russian tanks, organize themselves into councils, 
and lay claim to the management of the factories. In the United States, they 
insist on stopping the assembly line twice a day so they can have a cup of 
coffee. At the Breguet factories in Paris last spring, they went on strike and 
called for the abolition of most of the categories into which they are divided 
by management. For more than a century they have gotten killed crying, "To live 
working or to die fighting." In the "socialist" factories of the Russian 
bureaucracy, they force wages to be levelled out, despite the bitter complaints 
Khrushchev and his clique make in their speeches. With different degrees of 
development and various levels of clarification, all of these manifestations 
and, figuratively speaking, half of all the everyday actions of hundreds of 
millions of workers in all the enterprises of the world express this struggle 
for the instauration of new relations among people and with their work. And 
these manifestations and actions are comprehensible only in terms of a socialist 
perspective.</p>

<p class="fst">We must understand fully the dialectical unity the following 
diverse moments constitute: the analysis as well as the critique of capitalism, 
and the positive definition of the content of socialism as well as the 
interpretation of the proletariat's history. No critique, not even an analysis 
of the crisis of capitalism, is possible outside of a socialist perspective. 
Indeed, such a critique could not be based</p>

<p class="fst">Upon nothing at all - unless it be upon an ethics, which 
twenty-five centuries of philosophy have succeeded neither in founding nor even 
in defining. Every critique presupposes that something other than what it 
criticizes is possible and preferable. Every critique of capitalism therefore 
presupposes socialism.</p>

<p class="fst">Inversely, this notion of socialism cannot be merely the 
positive, flip side of this critique; the circle would then run the risk of 
becoming completely Utopian.</p>

<p class="fst">The positive content of socialism can be derived only from the 
real history, from the real life of the class that is tending toward its 
realization. Here we have its ultimate source.</p>

<p class="fst">But neither does it mean that the conception of socialism is the 
passive and complete reflection of the history of the proletariat. It is based 
just as much upon a choice, which is merely the expression of a revolutionary 
political attitude. This choice is not arbitrary, for there is here no rational 
alternative. The alternative would be simply/the conclusion that history is only 
a "tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing," and that 
it can only remain so. It is only in terms of a revolutionary politics that the 
history of the proletariat can be the source of this politics.</p>

<p class="fst">For someone with a different attitude, this history is merely the 
source of statistics and monographs of anything at all and ultimately of nothing 
at all. Indeed, neither the critique of capitalism nor the positive definition 
of socialism, neither the interpretation of the history of the proletariat nor a 
revolutionary politics is possible outside of a theory. The socialist elements 
that the proletariat continually produces have to be extrapolated and 
generalized into the total project that is socialism, otherwise they are 
meaningless. The analysis and critique of class society have to be systematized, 
otherwise they have no portent of truth. Both are impossible without a 
theoretical labour in the proper sense, without an effort to rationalize that 
which is simply given.</p>

<p class="fst">This rationalization involves its own risks and contradictions. 
As theory it is obliged to begin with the logical and epistemological structures 
of present-day culture - which are in no way neutral forms, independent of their 
content, but which express rather, in an antagonistic and contradictory fashion, 
the attitudes, behaviours, and visions of its subject and object, which have 
their dialectical equivalents in the social relations of capitalism. 
Revolutionary theory therefore constantly runs the risk of falling under the 
influence of the dominant ideology in forms that are much more subtle and 
deep-seated, much more hidden and dangerous than the "direct" ideological 
influence traditionally denounced in opportunism, for example. Marxism has not 
escaped this fate, as we already have shown,<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> 
and we will provide still more such examples.</p>

<p class="fst">It is only by returning each time to the source, by confronting 
the results of theory with the real meaning of the proletariat's life and 
history, that we can revolutionize our very methods of thought, which are 
inherited from class society, and can construct through successive upheavals a 
socialist theory. Only by assimilating all these points of view and their 
profound unity can we advance.</p>

<p class="fst">We begin our analysis of the crisis of capitalism with an 
analysis of the contradictions of the capitalist enterprise. The concepts and 
methods thus acquired in this primordial domain, the domain of production, will 
allow us then to generalize our investigation and subject the various social 
spheres and finally all of the social as such to this examination.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h2">The Contradictions in the Capitalist Organization of the Enterprise</a></h2>

<p class="fst">For the traditional view, which is still quite widespread today, 
the contradictions and irrationality of capitalism exist and actively manifest 
themselves on the overall level of the economy, but affect the capitalist 
enterprise only by ricochet. Leaving aside the conditions imposed upon it by its 
integration into an irrational and anarchic market, the enterprise is the place 
where efficiency and capitalist rationalization reign supreme. Under penalty of 
death, competition obliges capitalism to pursue the maximum result with the 
minimum of means.</p>

<p class="fst">For is this not the very goal of economics, the definition of its 
rationality? In order to arrive at this goal, it puts "science in the service of 
production" to an ever-increasing extent, and it rationalizes the labour process 
through the intermediary of engineers and technicians, those embodiments of 
operant rationality. It is absurd that these enterprises manufacture armaments, 
absurd that periodic crises make them work below capacity - but there is nothing 
to criticize in their organization. The rationality of this organization is the 
basis on which socialist society will be built once the anarchy of the market is 
eliminated and other goals - the satisfaction of needs rather than the 
maximization of profits - are assigned to production.</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin subscribed to this view absolutely. As for Marx himself, 
there was no basic difference. For him, the enterprise certainly is not pure 
rationalization. Or, more precisely, this type of rationalization contains a 
profound contradiction. It develops by enslaving living labour to dead labour, 
it signifies that the products of man's activity dominate man, and therefore it 
gives rise to a kind of oppression, a kind of mutilation that increases without 
ever stopping.</p>

<p class="fst">But it is a contradiction that is, if we can call it that, 
"philosophical," abstract, and this is so in two senses. First of all, it 
affects man's fate in production, and not production itself. The permanent 
mutilation of the producer, his transformation into a "fragment of a man" does 
not impede capitalist rationalization. It is merely its subjective side. 
Rationalization is exactly symmetrical to dehumanisation. The same step carries 
both of them forward. To rationalize production means to ignore and even to 
deliberately crush people's habits, desires, needs, and tendencies insofar as 
these are opposed to the logic of productive efficiency, while ruthlessly 
subjecting all aspects of labour to the imperatives of achieving the maximum 
result with the minimum of means. Necessarily, therefore, man becomes the means 
of this end that is production.</p>

<p class="fst">As a result, this contradiction remains "philosophical" and 
abstract also in a second sense: Without mincing words, it is because we cannot 
do anything about it. This situation is the inexorable result of a phase of 
technical development and ultimately even of the very nature of economics, "the 
reign of necessity." This is alienation in the Hegelian sense: Man has to lose 
himself first in order to find himself again - and to find himself again on 
another plane, after having gone through purgatory. It is the reduction of the 
workday that will allow there to be a socialist organization of society, and it 
is the abolition of the waste-fullness of the capitalist market that will make 
man free - outside of production.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In fact, as we shall see, this philosophical conception is the 
real contradiction of capitalism, and the source of the crisis in the most 
down-to-earth and material sense of this term. In its most microscopic as well 
as its most large-scale aspects, the crisis of capitalism directly expresses the 
following fact: that man's situation and status qua producer under capitalism 
are contradictory and ultimately absurd. The capitalist rationalization of the 
relations of production is only rationalization in appearance. This huge pyramid 
of means ought to acquire its meaning from its ultimate end. But having become a 
goal in itself and detached from everything else, the ultimate end of increasing 
production for its own sake is absolutely irrational. Production is one of man's 
means, man is not one of the means of production. The irrationality of this 
ultimate end determines from one end to the other the entire capitalist 
production process; whatever rationality it might contain in the domain of 
means, when it is put in the service of an irrational end, it becomes irrational 
itself. But the principal one of these means is man himself. To make man 
completely a means of production signifies the transformation of the subject 
into an object, it signifies treating him as a thing in the domain of 
production. Whence we have a second irrational aspect, another concrete 
contradiction, insofar as this transformation of people into things, this 
reification, is in conflict with the very development of production, which is 
indeed the essence of capitalism and which cannot take place without also 
developing people.</p>

<p class="fst">But what thus appears as an objective and impersonal 
contradiction acquires its historical meaning only through its transformation 
into human and social conflict. It is the producers' permanent struggle against 
their reification that transforms what otherwise would remain a mere opposition 
between concepts into a crisis rending the entire organization of society. There 
is no crisis of capitalism resulting from the operation of "objective laws" or 
dialectical contradictions. Such a crisis exists only insofar as people revolt 
against the established rules. This revolt, inversely, begins as a revolt 
against the concrete conditions of production; it is therefore at this level 
that we must seek both the origin of and the model for the general crisis of the 
system.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h3">The Hour of Work</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The contradiction of capitalism appears from the outset in the 
simple question of how capital and the worker relate to each other: What is an 
hour of work?</p>

<p class="fst">Through the labour contract the worker sells his labour power to 
the enterprise. But what is this labour power? Does the worker sell his "time"? 
But what is this "time"? The worker, of course, does not sell his mere presence. 
During a period when the workers were struggling to reduce the workday from 
twelve or fourteen hours, Marx asked, what is a workday? This meant: How many 
hours are there in a workday? But there is an even profounder question: What is 
an hour of work? In other words, how much work is there in an hour? The labour 
contract can define the daily duration of work and the hourly wage - and 
therefore what the capitalist owes to the worker for an hour of work. But how 
much work does the worker owe to the capitalist for an hour? It is impossible to 
say. It is upon this sand that capitalist relations of production are built.</p>

<p class="fst">In the past, the mode and pace of work were set in an almost 
immutable fashion by natural conditions and inherited techniques, habit, and 
custom. Today, natural conditions and techniques are in a constant state of 
upheaval so as to accelerate production. The worker, however, has lost all 
interest in working except as it helps him to win his bread. Inevitably, 
therefore, he resists this attempt to accelerate his work pace. The content of 
an hour of work, the actual labour the worker has to furnish in an hour, thus 
becomes the object of a permanent conflict.</p>

<p class="fst">Now, in the capitalist universe there exists no rational 
criterion that would allow this conflict to be resolved. Whether the worker 
"loafs" or dies of exhaustion over his machine is neither "logical" nor 
"illogical." The relation of forces between workers and capital alone can 
determine the pace of work under given conditions. Every real solution therefore 
represents a compromise, a truce based on the relation of forces existing at 
that moment. By its very essence such a truce is temporary. The relation of 
forces changes. Even if it does not change, the technical situation will be 
modified. The compromise that was arrived at so arduously starting from a given 
configuration of machinery, a particular type of manufacturing process, etc., 
collapses; in the new situation the previous set of norms no longer makes any 
sense. And thus conflict begins anew.</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, in order to overcome this conflict as well as to be 
able to plan production in the enterprise, capitalism is obliged to search for 
an "objective," "rational" basis for setting production norms. The essential 
element of this planning process is to be found in the labour time devoted to 
each operation. Insofar as production has not been completely automated, each 
unit of time always boils down in the last analysis to "human time," in other 
words, to the output actually obtained where living labour continues to make 
itself felt. This truth remains concealed from the production engineers insofar 
as "depreciation on equipment," for example, can appear (when the factory is not 
completely integrated) as an autonomous and irreducible element in cost 
computations. This, however, is only an optical illusion that is due to the fact 
that under the present structural setup, the engineer is obliged to take the 
part for the whole. The cost of equipment depreciation is nothing but the labour 
of workers who manufacture it or repair it (machinists). Hence, one cannot 
calculate, for example, a machine's "optimal running speed" - which balances the 
labour cost of the worker utilizing it against the cost of "depreciation on 
equipment" - unless the actual efficiency of these machinists also is taken into 
account.</p>

<p class="fst">We will return later to this question, which is decisive for the 
"rationality" of capitalist production. It suffices to point out here two 
things. First, the inability to consider the entire production process beyond 
the accidental boundaries of the particular enterprise destroys at its base all 
pretension to "rationality" on the part of the capitalist organization; one is 
obliged to consider as irreducible givens what are in reality a part of the 
problem to be resolved. Second, even on the scale of the individual enterprise, 
the capitalist management inevitably remains, as will be seen, at least 
partially in the dark about the real output and efficiency of different types of 
labour. This state of ignorance therefore also makes it impossible for this type 
of management to plan production in a rational manner.</p>

<p class="fst">Taylorism and all the methods of "scientific management" that 
flow from it claim either directly or indirectly to furnish such an "objective" 
basis. Postulating that there is only "one best way" to accomplish each 
operation, they try to establish this "one best way"<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> 
and to make it the criterion for how much output the worker should furnish. This 
"one best way" is to be discovered by breaking down each operation into a series 
of movements, the duration of which is to be measured, and by choosing, among 
the various types of movements carried out by various workers, the most 
"economic" ones. By adding together these "elementary times,"<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> 
one is supposed to be able to determine the normal amount of time required for 
the total operation. For each type of operation, we then would be able to tell 
the actual amount of labour an hour of clock time contains and thereby overcome 
the conflict over output. Ideally, this method ought to allow us even to 
eliminate supervisors, insofar as the latter are used to make sure that the 
workers furnish the maximum amount of labour possible: Paid according to the 
ratio between their output and the norm, workers would supervise themselves. One 
part of the conflicts over wages finally could be eliminated, since the actual 
wage would depend henceforth on the worker himself.</p>

<p class="fst">In fact, this method runs aground. Taylorism and the "scientific 
management" movement have resolved certain problems;<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> 
they have created many others and on the whole they have not permitted 
capitalism to get beyond its daily crisis in the area of production. Because of 
the bankruptcy of "scientific" rationalization, capitalism is constantly obliged 
to return to the empiricism of coercion pure and simple, and thereby to 
aggravate the conflict inherent in its mode of production, to heighten its 
anarchy, and to multiply its wastefulness. First of all there is an 
insurmountable gap between the postulates of the theoretical conception and the 
essential characteristics of the real situation in which this conception tries 
to assert itself. The "one best way" has no relation to the concrete reality of 
production. Its definition presupposes the existence of ideal conditions, 
conditions that are extremely far removed from the actual conditions the worker 
faces, such as problems relating to the quality of equipment and raw materials, 
the need to establish an uninterrupted flow of supplies, etc. - in short, it 
presupposes the complete elimination of all the "accidents" that often interrupt 
the course of production or give rise to unforeseen problems.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But in particular, there are flaws immanent in the theoretical 
conception itself. From the physiological point of view, work is an expenditure 
of effort multiplied by a duration of time. This duration is measurable, but the 
expenditure of effort is not (it involves a muscular component a component of 
attentiveness, an intellectual component, etc.). "Time studies" can take into 
account only the duration of time. As for the rest, they confine themselves to 
"the subjective judgments or interpretations of the engineer responsible for the 
measurement of the practical calculations and this deprives the results of any 
scientific value."<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> But work is 
not only a physiological function; it is a total activity of the person who 
accomplishes it. The idea that there is "one best way" for each operation 
ignores the basic fact that each working individual can have and does have his 
manner of adapting himself to the job and of adapting it to himself. What 
appears to the scientific manager as an absurd, time-wasting movement has its 
own logic in the personal psychosomatic makeup of the worker in question which 
leads him to follow his own "best way" to complete a given operation.</p>

<p class="fst">The worker tends to resolve the problems his work poses for him 
in a manner that corresponds to his overall way of being. His gestures are not 
like a set of toy blocks where one could pull out one cube and replace it with a 
"better" one while leaving everything else in place. A gesture that is 
apparently "more rational" and "more economical" can be much more difficult for 
some particular worker than the way of doing things that he has invented for 
himself and that thereby expresses his organic adaptation to this hands-on 
struggle with machinery and materials that constitutes the work process. Such a 
gesture is carried out more rapidly because another one is carried out more 
slowly; merely adding together the minimum amounts of time used by different 
workers is a glaring absurdity, but applying a standard "normal performance 
rate" to all the successive phases of an operation carried out by the same 
worker is an even greater one. The worker's entire set of gestures is not a 
garment that might be replaced with another. A human being cannot spend 
two-thirds of his waking life carrying out movements that are foreign to him and 
that correspond to nothing within him. Tacking "rational" gestures onto the 
worker in this way is not simply inhuman' in actuality, it is impossible, it 
never can be fully realized. Indeed, even for the gestures that workers make up 
themselves, and even for each worker taken individually, there is no "one best 
way"; experience shows that the same worker alternatively uses several methods 
of carrying out the same job, if only to relieve the monotony of his work. <a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">
[10]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h4">Critique of the Theoretical Critique</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The idea that labor is only a succession of elementary movements 
of a measurable duration, that this duration of time is their sole significant 
feature, makes sense only if we accept the following postulate: The worker in 
the capitalist factory should be completely transformed into an appendage of the 
machinery. As with a machine, one determines the movements that are "rational" 
and those that are not; one retains the former and eliminates the latter. As 
with a machine, the total time to complete an operation is merely the sum of the 
"elementary times" of the movements into which one can, mechanically, resolve 
this operation. Like the machine, the worker does not have and should not have 
any personal traits; more precisely, as with the machine, the worker's "personal 
traits" are considered and treated as irrational accidents to be eliminated.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The theoretical critique of Taylorism, in particular as it is 
conducted by modern industrial sociologists<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> 
lies essentially in showing that this view is absurd, that man is not a machine, 
that Taylor was mechanistic, etc. But this is only a half truth. The whole truth 
is that the reality of modern production, where hundreds of millions of 
individuals spend their lives in enterprises dispersed all over the world, is 
precisely this very "absurdity." Taylor, from this point of view, did not invent 
anything at all; he merely systematized and brought to its logical conclusion 
what has always been the logic of capitalist organisation that is to say, the 
capitalist logic of organisation. What is astonishing is not. that mechanistic" 
and absurd ideas were able to germinate in the heads of the Ideologues and 
organizational managers of industry. These ideas merely give expression to the 
peculiar reality of capitalism. The astonishing thing is that the sphere of 
production, capitalism almost has succeeded in transforming man into an 
appendage of the machinery, that the reality of modern production is only this 
very endeavour renewed each day, each instant. This endeavour fails only to the 
exact extent that in the sphere of production people refuse to be treated as 
machines. Every critique of the inhuman character of capitalist production that 
does not take as its point of departure the practical critique of this 
inhumanity that the workers themselves bring to bear in the sphere of production 
through their daily struggle against capitalist methods ultimately is merely 
literary moralizing.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h5">The Workers' Practical Critique</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The root of the failure of "scientific management'; methods is 
the bitter opposition that the workers have shown from the very outset. And of 
course, the first manifestation of this resistance is the permanent struggle 
that sets workers against the time-study men. It is on the terrain of this 
struggle that in every factory the workers immediately realize a spontaneous 
association. For obvious reasons, the actions that are the expression of this 
spontaneous association are little known, but their import and universality 
become clear once we listen to an author who is familiar with what goes on 
inside a factory.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The first outcome of this resistance obviously is that all 
semblance of "objective" justification for such "elementary times" is destroyed. 
The conflict between workers and management is transposed onto the plane of 
determining these time periods. This process of determination presupposes a 
certain degree of collaboration on the workers' part. The latter refuse to do 
so. Management might have been able to dispense with this collaboration if its 
techniques were unchanging; in that case, little by little it would have been 
able to set down for good norms representing the maximum amount of output that 
can be extorted from the worker under a given set of conditions. These 
techniques, however, are constantly changing; norms have to be reset, and 
conflict begins anew.</p>

<p class="fst">Speaking of an enterprise in which there is a methods department 
that brings up to date" the times allotted to workers, a right-thinking author 
writes:</p>

<p class="fst">Surveys are constantly being brought up to date to take account 
of:</p>

<p class="fst">a) rapid technical development: improvements in processes and in 
the machinery manufactured.</p>

<p class="fst">b) the large number of operations.</p>

<p class="fst">The allotted time is frequently revised and should normally be 
agreed upon by the workers. Experience shows that this is not the case and that 
these revisions are the cause of frequent disputes capable of leading to local 
strike action.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As the norms cannot be put into effect or even established 
without at least a certain degree of grudging acceptance on the part of the 
workers, and as the latter do not cooperate, the exploiters' first counter 
response is to establish them with the collaboration of a minority that they buy 
off. Here is the ultimate meaning of Stakhanovism: It is to establish 
monstrously exaggerated norms based on the output of certain individuals who are 
given a privileged position and who are placed under conditions that bear no 
relation to the current conditions of the actual production process.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> 
A twofold result thus is aimed at: (1) to create within the proletariat a 
privileged stratum that is a direct support for the exploiters and that is 
helpful in dissolving working-class solidarity precisely on the terrain of their 
resistance to increases in output; and (2) to utilize the norms thus 
established, if not as such, at least in order to shorten the times allotted for 
the mass of production workers. But Stakhanovism is not the invention of Stalin; 
its true father is Taylor. In his first "experiment," at Bethlehem Steel 
Company, after a "scientific" motion study was conducted, Taylor set a norm four 
times higher than the average output theretofore achieved, and he "proved" three 
years later with a specially chosen Dutch worker that this norm "could have been 
realized." Nevertheless, when one tried to extend this system to seventy-five 
other workers on the gang after having taught them the "rational" method of 
working, it was discovered that only one worker in eight could keep up with the 
norm.</p>

<p class="fst">Consequently, the problem was posed anew, for norms established 
based upon the output of a few "rate-busters" or a few Stakhanovites cannot be 
extended to the rest of the workers. The Russian bureaucracy's ultimate 
abandonment of Stakhanovism is the glaring admission of the bankruptcy of this 
method.</p>

<p class="fst">In fact, management's real counter response - which at the same 
time wipes out all of Taylorism's scientific pretensions and closes the 
discussion from this standpoint - is that it itself sabotages every "rational" 
employment of scientific management methods and reverts to arbitrarily imposing 
norms, backed up with coercion. Each year, hundreds and thousands of books and 
articles appear on the topic of "scientific management," "time studies," etc.; 
hundreds and thousands of individuals are "trained" to apply these methods. 
Simplifying the issue but remaining faithful to the essence of the actual 
situation, we can state that all this is an enormous masquerade that has nothing 
to do with the setting of norms as it is practiced in a real industrial setting. 
The objective basis for establishing these norms essentially comes from fraud, 
spying, and assorted types of pressure.</p>

<p class="fst">Workers who think of the time-study men as policemen refer not 
only to the content but to the methods of their "work" as well. In the Renault 
factories, the setting of norms often occurs in the following fashion: Unknown 
to the workers, a new time-study man is sent to walk around the shops and to 
note while passing by unnoticed the amounts of time required for various 
operations (one can easily imagine the true value of the "times" noted in this 
way). With the aid of these "times," the time-study man mixes up a concoction - 
the new "norm" - which he then will haggle over with the supervisor of the shop 
in question. The final norm is the outcome of this process of haggling. One or 
two weeks later, a ritual performance is enacted in the shop: The time-study man 
comes to time the workers, starts his stopwatch, bustles about, pronounces some 
cabalistic words, and then disappears. Finally, the result is proclaimed - which 
had been decided upon in advance.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In another factory, in September, 1954, the Methods Department 
timed all the operations carried out in the assembly shop; the time-study 
engineer, questioned by the head of the workshop and a delegate, stated that he 
was carrying out a revision of the operating methods shown on the chart. ... On 
December 29, 1954, new times, representing an average reduction of about 20% in 
allotted time, were notified to the shop delegates. ... The workers concerned 
stopped work; the arguments put forward by their delegates were as follows:</p>

<p class="fst">1. The delegates and the workers had been misinformed about the 
purpose of the time-study operations. ...<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">If management's agents are forced to hide like thieves in 
management's own shops, we can definitely say that all discussion about 
"rationalizing" efficiency and norms is nothing but mystificatory drivel. In 
fact, in such a situation, norms express merely management's Diktat - the 
enforcement of which depends on the workers' capacity for resistance.</p>

<p class="fst">Almost nothing is changed in this situation when the trade unions 
intervene. In theory, the trade unions' line is that they are "opposed to all 
modifications of the norms and speed of production, unless these modifications 
are justified by improvements in the equipment or changes in the manufacturing 
processes." In reality, management constantly modifies its equipment and its 
manufacturing processes precisely in order to accelerate the work pace. Hence we 
see that the trade unions end up being opposed to modifications of norms in all 
cases ... except, it turns out, when it is really important. How indeed can it 
be judged whether or not some particular equipment change or alteration of the 
manufacturing process "justifies" a change in the norms? Management constantly 
relies upon this inability to make a judgment in order to cut down on any "slack 
in time," and it does so under the pretext of "technical modifications" that are 
in fact fictional. An American worker put it this way: "They'll tear a machine 
to pieces to change something to cut a price."<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Once the norm is set, one's problems are far from being over. 
Management is assured of the quantity of the workers' output but not its 
quality. Except for the simplest of jobs, this is a decisive question. Rushed by 
norms that are difficult to adhere to, the worker naturally will have a tendency 
to make up for it on the quality of his work. Quality control over manufactured 
parts becomes a new source of conflicts.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> 
On the other hand, products cannot be manufactured without greater or lesser 
depreciation on the equipment - and generally, it is easier to increase output 
by depreciating one's equipment to an abnormally high degree. Management's only 
response lies in setting up additional supervisory controls - whence there arise 
additional conflicts.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Indeed, the problem of effective output remains completely open. 
We will see how workers succeed in emptying a set of norms of its content and 
even in turning it against management.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h6">The Collective Reality of Production and the Individualized Organization of 
the Capitalist Enterprise</a></h2>

<p class="fst">In an abstract form, the contradiction of capitalism appears at 
the outset in production's molecular element: the individual worker's work hour. 
The content of the work hour has directly opposite meanings for capital and for 
the worker. For the former, its meaning is that of maximum output; for the 
latter, it is the output corresponding to the amount of effort he thinks is 
fair.</p>

<p class="fst">But in modern production the individual worker is an abstraction. 
To a degree which was unknown under other historical forms of production, 
capitalist production is a collective form of production. Not only in society, 
but in the factory and in each shop, the jobs performed by one person are 
dependent upon the jobs performed by everyone else. This dependence takes on 
more and more direct forms as its scope continually widens and as it comes to 
cover all aspects of the operations of production. No longer is it merely the 
case that a worker cannot carry out some operation on some components if 
unfinished components are not provided at the required speed; the worker must 
also be provided with tools, power, "services" (tool setups, stock management, 
etc.). Furthermore, every aspect of an operation is directly interdependent with 
every aspect of all the operations preceding it as well as with those that will 
follow. Indeed, on a production line and, still more, on an assembly line, 
individual rhythms and gestures are only the materialization of a total rhythm 
that pre-exists them, controls them, and gives them a meaning. The true subject 
of modern production is not the individual; it is, to various degrees, a 
collectivity of workers.</p>

<p class="fst">Now, capitalism simultaneously develops this collective reality 
of modern production to the extreme and, in its mode of organization, fiercely 
repudiates it. At the same time that it absorbs individuals into ever-larger 
enterprises, assigning them jobs whose interdependence increases every day, 
capitalism claims to be Concerned only with, and wants to be concerned only 
with, the individual worker. This is not just some contradiction on the level of 
ideas - although that too exists and manifests itself in a thousand ways. It is 
a real contradiction. Capitalism is perpetually trying to retransform the 
producers into a cloud of individual dust particles lacking any organic tie 
among themselves, yet management clusters this cloud of dust together at 
convenient spots on the mechanical Moloch, according to the "logic" of this 
total machine. Capitalist "rationalisation" begins by being, and remains to the 
end, a meticulous regulation of the relationship between the individual worker 
and the machine or the segment of the total machine on which he works. This, as 
we have seen, is in keeping with the very essence of capitalist production. Work 
is reduced here to a series of meaningless gestures going on at a frantic pace, 
during the course of which the worker's exploitation and alienation 
unremittingly tend to increase. For the workers, this work is a kind of forced 
labour to which they put up both individual and collective resistance. As a 
counter response to this resistance, capitalism has at its disposal only 
economic and mechanical forms of coercion. Payment in terms of achieved output 
is supposed to furnish the worker with motivations capable of making him accept 
this inhuman situation. But this payment has meaning only in relation to the 
individual worker, whose gestures have been taken apart and timed, whose work 
has been defined, measured, monitored, etc.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus, this method comes into violent conflict with the reality of 
collectivised and socialized production. Dissolving the organic ties between the 
individual and his group and transforming the producers into an anonymous mass 
of proletarians, capitalism is destroying the social groups that preceded it, 
the corporation or the village. Grouped into enterprises, these proletarians 
cannot live and coexist without resocializing themselves, at a different level; 
they are resocialized under the new conditions created by the situation in which 
they are placed within the capitalist world and which, by becoming resocialized, 
they transform. In the factory, capitalism is constantly trying to reduce them 
to mechanical and economic molecules, to isolate them, to make them gravitate 
around the total machine under the hypothesis that they obey only the dictates 
of economic motivation, this Newtonian law of the capitalist universe. And each 
time, these attempts are shattered when confronted with the perpetually renewed 
process through which individuals are socialized in the world of production - a 
process upon which capitalism itself is constantly obliged to rely.</p>

<p class="fst">The spontaneous constitution of elementary collective units 
within the framework imposed by capitalism is the first aspect this process of 
socializing the workers takes on. These elementary groups<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> 
constitute a firm's basic social units. Capitalism clusters individuals together 
within a team or a shop, pretending to keep them isolated from each other and 
linking them solely through the intermediary of production processes. In fact, 
as soon as workers are brought together to do a job, social relations are 
established among them, a collective attitude toward the job, supervisors, 
management, and other workers develops. The first facet of this socialization 
process on the level of the elementary group is to be found in the fact that the 
workers who make it up spontaneously lend to organize themselves, to cooperate 
with each other, and to deal with the problems raised by the work they have in 
common and with their relationships to the rest of the factory and to 
management. Just as an individual, when confronted with a job, organizes himself 
- half-consciously, half-unconsciously - in order to carry it out, so, on a 
different level, a number of workers, when confronted with a job, will tend to 
organize themselves - half-consciously, half-unconsciously - in order to carry 
it through, to give some order to the relations among the individual jobs of its 
members, and to make it into a whole corresponding to the goal in question. It 
is to this type of organization that elementary groups correspond. Elementary 
groups of workers include a varying, but generally small, number of persons. 
These groups are based on the direct and permanent contacts established among 
their members and on the interdependent character of the jobs these people 
perform. Workers in a workshop may form one or many elementary groups, depending 
upon the size of the shop, the nature and degree of unity of the jobs they carry 
out, but also as a function of other factors related to personal, ideological, 
and other kinds of attraction and repulsion. Often, but not necessarily, 
elementary groups coincide with the "crews" designated in the official 
organization of the shop.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> They 
are the living nuclei of productive activity - as elementary groups of another 
type are the living nuclei of all social activities at different levels. Within 
them we find already manifested the workers' self-managerial attitude, their 
tendency to organize themselves in order to resolve the problems raised by their 
work and by their relations with the rest of society.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h7">Elementary Groups and Industrial Sociology</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Bourgeois academic sociology has brought to light the fact that 
in reality modern production relies for the most part on this spontaneous 
association of workers into elementary groups, or more exactly on the 
self-transformation of fortuitous assemblages of individuals into organic 
collectivities.<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> Undoubtedly, 
modern industrial sociology has made a decisive contribution to the recognition 
of the fundamental importance of this phenomenon, and concurrently, to the 
critique of the capitalist organization of human relations in production, 
starting out from this point of view. This contribution is totally undermined, 
however, by the general outlook of its authors just as the critique of the 
capitalist enterprise that follows therefrom only results in a Utopian and 
impotent reformism.</p>

<p class="fst">The perspective through which industrial sociologists most of the 
time view elementary groups is "psychologistic." Like all human beings, workers 
tend to become socialized, to enter into reciprocal relationships, to form 
"bands." Their motivation to work is constituted starting from their belonging 
to a "band" and not starting from economic considerations. The "work ethic" 
depends on this feeling of belonging, on the ties that unite the individual and 
his group. The fundamental flaw of the capitalist organization of production is 
that it ignores these phenomena. From its own point of view management is wrong 
to arbitrarily transfer workers, to assign a new trainee to a given crew without 
worrying about the relationships that might arise between him and others, and 
more generally, to be unaware of the reality belonging to the elementary group. 
This regrettable lack of awareness is to be attributed to the erroneous 
theoretical conceptions (those that Mayo<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a>) 
encapsulates under the name of the "rabble hypothesis" and that we prefer to 
designate henceforth in this text by the term "molecular hypothesis"<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a> 
that have predominated for some time now. The critique of this conception ought 
to lead production managers to change their attitude toward the problem of human 
relations in the enterprise, thus allowing actual conflicts and wastefulness to 
be eliminated.</p>

<p class="fst">The paternalistic and idealistic character of these solutions, 
their thoroughly Utopian content, and their laborious naivet are obvious. 
Management's theoretical conceptions do not determine the relations between 
management and the workers in the capitalist firm. These conceptions merely give 
abstract expression to the inescapable necessities management faces qua external 
management and qua exploitative management. The molecular hypothesis is a 
necessary product of capitalism and will disappear only when it does. From the 
practical point of view, when faced with the anarchy that characterizes both the 
capitalist enterprise and its relations with the market (or with the "plan"), 
management has other, more pressing matters than to be bothered with its 
employees' personal feelings toward each other. At the very most, a new 
bureaucratic department responsible for "human relations" may be created within 
the managerial apparatus. If it takes its role seriously, this department will 
be in permanent conflict with the exigencies of the "production" managers, and 
it will be reduced thereby to a decorative role; otherwise, it will put its 
"sociological" and "psychoanalytical" techniques at the disposal of the 
factory's system of coercion.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But the main point lies elsewhere. The workers' spontaneous 
association in elementary groups does not express the tendency of individuals to 
form groups in general. It is simultaneously a regrouping for the purposes of 
production and a regrouping for the purposes of struggle. It is because they 
have to resolve among themselves the problems involved in organizing their work 
(whose various aspects are mutually interrelated) that workers necessarily form 
elementary collectivities not mentioned on the organizational chart of any 
enterprise. It is because their situation in production creates among them a 
community of interests, attitudes, and objectives irremediably opposed to those 
of management that, at the most elementary level, workers spontaneously 
associate together to resist, to defend themselves, and to struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">To invite management to recognize these elementary groups means 
to invite it to commit suicide.<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a> 
For these groups are constituted from the start against management, not only 
because they struggle to make their interests prevail in irremediable opposition 
to its interests, but also because the very foundation of their existence, their 
primary objective, is the management [gestion] of their own activity. The group 
tends to organize the activity of its members, to define the norms relating to 
how much they should exert themselves and how they should behave. All this 
signifies a radical challenge to the very existence of a separate management 
[direction]. The inability of "elementary group" sociologists to recognize 
clearly the consequences of this state of affairs constitutes the main stumbling 
block for this type of sociology.<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h8">The Informal Organization of the Enterprise</a></h2>

<p class="fst">This challenge indeed goes far beyond the bounds of the 
elementary group. On the one hand, these groups tend to put themselves in 
contact with each other; on the other hand and more generally, contacts and 
relationships are established between individuals and groups throughout the 
enterprise, alongside and in opposition to the official organization. Along with 
modern industrial sociology, we are learning that the enterprise has a double 
structure and leads, so to speak, a double life. There is, on the one hand, its 
formal organization, the one represented on organizational charts, the one whose 
ruling summits proceed along the lines of these charts in order to allocate and 
define the work of each person, to keep informed, to send orders, or to assign 
responsibilities. To this formal organization there is opposed in reality the 
informal organization, whose activities are carried out and supported by 
individuals and groups at all levels of the hierarchical pyramid according to 
the requirements of their work, the imperatives of productive efficiency, and 
the necessities of their struggle against exploitation.<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> 
Correlatively, there is what indeed might be called the formal production 
process and the real production process. The first includes what ought to happen 
in the enterprise according to the plans, diagrams, regulations, methods for 
transmitting information, etc., established by management. The second is the one 
that actually is enacted. It often bears little relation to the first.</p>

<p class="fst">The failure of the individualist type of capitalist organization 
therefore goes far beyond the elementary group. Cooperation tends to be carried 
out alongside and in opposition to this type of organization. But what is most 
important is that this opposition is not the opposition of "theory" and 
"practice," of "beautiful schemes on paper" and "reality." It has a social 
content, a content having to do with struggle. The formal organization of the 
factory coincides as a matter of fact with the bureaucratic managerial 
apparatus's system of organization. Its nodal points, its articulations are 
those of this apparatus. For in the official diagram of the enterprise, the 
whole enterprise is "contained" in its managerial apparatus; people exist only 
as provinces of power for those in charge. Beginning with the summit of what is 
properly called "management" (president-CEO in the firms of Western countries, 
the factory director in the Russian factory) and passing through the various 
offices, departments, and technical services of the enterprise, the bureaucratic 
managerial apparatus terminates with the shop foremen, supervisors, and team 
leaders. Formally, it even completely encompasses the executants - who in the 
official diagram are only clusters around each foreman or team leader.</p>

<p class="fst">The managerial apparatus pretends to be the only organization in 
the enterprise, the sole source of all order and of any kind of order. In fact, 
it creates as much disorder as order and more conflicts than it is capable of 
resolving. Facing it is the enterprise's informal organization, which includes 
the elementary groups of workers, various modes of lateral connections [liaison 
transversale] among these groups, similar associations among individuals in the 
managerial apparatus, and lots of isolated individuals at various levels who in 
extreme cases only have among themselves the relationships that the official 
diagram assumes they have. These two organizations, however, are truncated. The 
formal organization is riddled with holes by the base, it never succeeds in 
actually encompassing the immense mass of executants. The informal organization 
is thwarted by the heights; beyond the elementary groups of executants, it 
actually includes the individuals formally belonging to the managerial apparatus 
only when this apparatus starts to grow to enormous proportions, when the 
division of labour is pushed even further and is accompanied by further 
collectivisation, and, finally, when the work of the lower echelons of the 
managerial apparatus is transformed into merely another form of executant work, 
thus creating even within this apparatus a category of executants that struggles 
against the summits.<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The formal organization, therefore, is not a facade; in its 
reality it coincides with the managerial stratum. The informal organization is 
not an excrescence appearing in the interstices of the formal organization; it 
tends to represent a different mode of operation of the enterprise, centred 
around the real situation of the executants. The direction, the dynamic, and the 
outlook of the two organizations are entirely opposite - and opposed on a social 
terrain that ultimately coincides with that of the struggle between directors 
and executants.</p>

<p class="fst">For a struggle takes place between these two modes of 
organization, which is in all respects permanent and which ends up becoming 
identical with the enterprise's two social poles. This is what industrial 
sociologists, who usually just criticize the formal schema as absurd, too often 
forget. This situation is analogous to the one we discussed apropos of 
Taylorism, and the shortcomings of a purely theoretical critique are the same 
here. The managerial apparatus is constantly struggling to impose its scheme of 
organization; the absurdity of this schema is not theoretical, it is the reality 
of capitalism. What is astonishing is not the theoretical absurdity of the 
schema but the fact that capitalism almost succeeds in transforming people into 
points on an organizational chart. It fails only to the exact extent that people 
struggle against this transformation.</p>

<p class="fst">This struggle begins at the level of the elementary group, but it 
extends throughout the entire enterprise through the very need to produce and to 
defend against management; ultimately, it embraces the entire mass of 
executants. Its extension is founded on several successive moments. The position 
of each elementary group is essentially identical to that of the others; each of 
these groups inevitably is led to cooperate with the rest of the enterprise;<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a> 
and ultimately they all tend to merge in a class, the class of executants, 
defined by a community of situation, function, interests, attitude, mentality. 
Now, industrial sociology denies deep down this class perspective that verbally 
it accepts. It speaks of elementary groups as a universal phenomenon; but while 
it is willing to compare them with each other, it refuses to add them together. 
Nevertheless, it does more than just add them together since it recognizes in 
them the subject matter and a the same time the principle of the enterprise's 
informal organization. But it keeps these two moments - the identity of 
elementary groups throughout the enterprise and their cooperation - separate and 
does not venture to ask itself why there is a passage from one to the other. It 
therefore renders itself incapable of seeing the polarization of the enterprise 
between directors and executants and the struggle that sets them against each 
other, all the more so as it includes under the rubric of informal organization 
phenomena whose significations are radically different, such as when it compares 
the tendency of the executants to form their own type of organization to the 
formation of cliques and clans within the ruling bureaucracy. This actual 
refusal to place the firm's problems within a class perspective (and the process 
of class formation can be seen most vividly through an analysis of the 
enterprise) makes it sink into theoretical abstraction as well as get lost in 
"practical solutions," the Utopian character of which is based precisely on the 
imaginary suppression of the reality of classes.</p>

<p class="fst">We must add that Marxism admits of an abstraction that is almost 
symmetrical to the preceding one insofar as it has limited itself to immediately 
positing the concept of class and to directly opposing the proletariat and 
capitalism while neglecting the basic articulations within the enterprise and 
among the human groups within the enterprise. It thus has prevented itself from 
seeing the proletariat's vital process of class formation, of self-creation as 
the outcome of a permanent struggle that begins within production. It also has 
prevented itself from relating the proletariat's organizational problems in 
capitalist society to this process. And finally, insofar as the primary content 
of this struggle is the workers' tendency to manage their own work, it has 
prevented itself from posing workers' management as the central feature of the 
socialist program and from drawing from it all the possible implications. To the 
abstract concept of the proletariat corresponds the abstract concept of 
socialism as nationalization and planning, whose sole concrete content 
ultimately is revealed to be the totalitarian dictatorship of the 
representatives of this abstraction - of the bureaucratic party.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h9">The Contradictions Proper to Management's Bureaucratic Apparatus</a></h2>

<p class="fst">To achieve its own ends, the capitalist organization of 
production is obliged to pursue the fragmentation of production tasks and the 
atomisation of the producers ad infinitum. With respect to the end in view - the 
total subjugation of people - this process culminates in a double failure and 
leads to tremendous waste. At the same time, however, it gives rise very sharply 
to a second problem: that of how to recompose these operations of production 
into a whole. Individual jobs, supposedly defined, measured, monitored, etc., 
have to be integrated anew into a unified whole [ensemble], outside of which 
they are meaningless. Now, this reintegration can be accomplished in the 
capitalist factory only by the same authority following the same method of 
decomposition that "preceded" it, by a managerial apparatus separated from the 
producers that aims at subjecting them to capital's requirements and that treats 
them to this end as things, as fragments of the mechanical universe that are 
comparable to all others. Logically and technically, reintegration is only the 
flip side of decomposition; neither one can be carried out or have any meaning 
without the other. Economically and socially, the realization of the goals 
pursued during the phase of decomposition is impossible if these goals do not 
also predominate over the process of reintegration: The ground taken from the 
producers during the phase of decomposition could not be given back to them 
during the phase of reintegration without putting back into question the very 
structure of the relations of exploitation.<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As a consequence, the managerial apparatus will try to resolve 
the problem of reintegrating jobs itself, thereby denying deep down the 
collective character of production that it is obliged to grant on a formal 
level. For the managerial apparatus, the collectivity of workers is not a 
collectivity but a collection. Their labour is not a social process whose every 
part is in a constantly changing interdependence with all the others and with 
the whole, and whose every moment perpetually contains the seeds of something 
new; it is a sum of parts that someone from the outside can decompose and 
recompose at will, like a game of blocks, and that can change only insofar as 
something else is introduced into it. For it is only upon this condition that 
the command post of this collective activity could be transposed outside this 
activity with no repercussions. It is only upon this condition that exactly what 
one has put into its parts could be rediscovered in the whole, without losses or 
gains.</p>

<p class="fst">The managerial apparatus thus is obliged to take everything upon 
itself. In theory, all acts of production have to be doubled ideally and a 
priori within the bureaucratic apparatus; everything that involves a decision 
has to be worked out in advance - or after the fact - outside the operations of 
production themselves. Execution has to become pure execution, and 
symmetrically, management has to become absolute and perfect. Of course, such a 
situation never can be realized; but the "organizational" activity of the 
managerial apparatus is dominated by the necessary pursuit of this chimera, 
which puts it up against insoluble contradictions.</p>

<p class="fst">First of all, the very concept of a perfect, separate management 
is contradictory. A perfect, separate management is possible only if its 
complementary pole, a perfect, separate execution, also is possible. Now, 
perfect, separate execution is nonsensical. As human activity - as activity that 
cannot be conferred upon automated machinery - execution necessarily involves 
the element of self-direction; it is not and never can be execution pure and 
simple. Man is not and cannot be a perfect, separate executant, and this 
singular attempt to make him one creates in him both a situation and reactions 
that produce the opposite effect. This contrary situation is established because 
the suppression of the faculties of and capacities for self-direction (which are 
indispensable for tasks of "execution") are precisely what make him a bad 
executant. And these contrary reactions are created because man always tends in 
one fashion or another to take on the direction of his own activity and he 
revolts against this expropriation of his self-directing activity to which he is 
subjected. During the historical stages that preceded capitalism, this 
contradiction remained abstract and merely potential, basically because the form 
and content of productive activities were fixed once and for all. But capitalist 
production, which is in constant upheaval is continually obliged to call upon 
the human faculties of its executants in order to function. In this way the 
contradiction becomes an active and actual one, since the way the system 
functions leads it to affirm two things at once: "The worker should confine 
himself to the pure and simple execution of the tasks prescribed to him"; and, 
"The worker should bring about the end in view whatever the real conditions and 
available means and no matter how far these depart from theoretical conditions 
and means."</p>

<p class="fst">This gap cannot be bridged. Perfect, separate management can be 
conceived of only as the organ promulgating the perfect plan, which obviously 
cannot exist. Such a perfect plan would imply that management has absolute 
foresight and exhaustive information, both of which are impossible in 
themselves, two times impossible for a separate management, and three times 
impossible for a management that exploits the producers. Of course, modern 
industry tends to "rationalize" the set of conditions, means, and objects of 
production, and this rationalization is presented as the elimination of chance, 
of the unforeseen, and as the creation of standardized conditions for the 
production process as a whole. Under such conditions, it ought to be possible, 
after a period of trial and error and through successive approximations, to 
reach a "point of rest," after which production finally could unfold according 
to plan. But this would imply that from this moment on the conditions, methods, 
instruments, and objects of production were unalterably fixed. Now, the very 
essence of modern industry is perpetual change. From a large-scale point of 
view, one stage of technical development hardly has arrived at a level of 
"consolidation" when a new stage comes crashing onto the scene. From a 
small-scale point of view - which is just as important in the everyday life of 
the factory - "consolidation" is never achieved; "small" changes continually are 
being made in the materials, the machinery, the objects manufactured, and the 
ways people and machines are arranged (and these changes are precisely the 
expression of this process of "rationalization"). Thus, the plan has to be 
perpetually modified, and there never is time perfectly to adapt it to the 
unfolding of the production process.</p>

<p class="fst">Indeed, "standardization" remains an ideal norm that is never 
realized, for both social and "natural" reasons. Everything used at any given 
stage of the production process already is the result of previous industrial 
labour. In theory, this result, this product - whether we are talking about raw 
materials or a machine or a detachable part - is supposed to conform to a 
rigorous definition, to precise specifications of size, shape, quality, and so 
on within set margins of tolerance. It suffices that any one of these material 
or ideal components not correspond in reality to its theoretical definition for 
the plan not to be able to be put into effect as is; this does not mean, of 
course, that production collapses or even that there is necessarily any 
significant damage - but it implies that only the vital intervention of real 
people can serve as a substitute for some now out-of-date directive and can 
adapt on the spot the available means - which are different from the theoretical 
ones - to the end in view.</p>

<p class="fst">That all the components of any job are the result of a previous 
job signifies that as soon as the actual results of this job deviate at a given 
stage from the "theoretical" results, this gap has repercussions in one fashion 
or another upon the subsequent stages of the manufacturing process. Now, gaps of 
this kind are absolutely unavoidable in capitalist production, not only because 
the exploited executant is not interested in the result of his work and 
therefore often turns in "made up" results (which go along with a whole gamut of 
means for struggling [against the factory's "inspectors"), but also because the 
compartmentalized executant does not know and by definition should not know what 
is important and what is not important in what he is doing. All specifications 
that are set for him by the production directives he receives seem to be of 
equal importance (with allowed margins of tolerance). In fact they are not, 
either in the absolute or from the point of view of possibly making up for some 
gap without difficulties arising at a subsequent stage in the production 
process. Inasmuch as the executant, pressed by time restrictions, cannot handle 
everything at once, he will take shortcuts at random. For its part, the planning 
department cannot establish which aspects are truly important and which ones are 
not: On the one hand, it does not itself know which ones are important, for the 
establishment of such a hierarchy results from actual practice within an 
industrial setting from which it is, by definition, separated; on the other 
hand, its role is to present all directives as equally and absolutely important. 
Thus, by rendering an intelligent execution of tasks impossible, the methods of 
a separate managerial stratum themselves lead toward their own defeat.<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Similarly, there is always an unforeseen "natural" element, even 
under the conditions of large-scale modern industry. Even materials manufactured 
under the best possible conditions present specific, unanticipated problems that 
must be compensated for in an equally unforeseen manner as they are worked upon. 
Even electronic computers, which are manufactured not under industrial 
conditions but under laboratory conditions, break down or go haywire for unknown 
reasons.<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a> At each new stage, 
modern industry stretches to the limit its exploitation of the possibilities of 
knowledge and of matter; during each new period, it tends to work at the edge of 
the known and the feasible. This continuous displacement of its frontiers 
signifies that it can never comfortably remain within the regions it has already 
fully explored. A new territory has hardly been opened up when it must already 
be exploited under the conditions of mass production. Its means expand at a 
dizzying rate - but so do its objectives and manufacturing requirements. 
Instruments become finer and finer and more and more precise - but at the same 
time the limits of tolerance become narrower and narrower. In the past, the 
"unforeseen," the "irrational," and the "accidental" consisted of a cleft in the 
steel bar; today it can lie in infinitesimal irregularities in the chemical 
composition of molecules. It is not the degree of matter's resistance to man 
that is diminishing, it is the line on which this resistance becomes effective 
that is being displaced - so that the gap between theory and reality can always 
be filled in only by practice, only by man's simultaneously rational and 
concrete intervention. But this practice itself is constantly being elevated to 
a higher level, and it presupposes that the individual's ever more highly 
developed capabilities - which are absolutely incompatible with the role of a 
pure and simple executant - will be put to work. These are the reasons why the 
reality of production always deviates in a more or less appreciable manner from 
the plan and from production directives - and why this gap can be filled only by 
means of the practice, the invention, the creativity of the mass of executants. 
Each time that a new manufacturing process is introduced or a new product model 
is to be manufactured, and after the factory's various departments and engineers 
have spent months or years developing and "perfecting" the process or product in 
question, weeks or months will pass before production begins to flow in a 
somewhat satisfactory manner. Car drivers know that when a factory "launches" a 
new model, the cars produced during the first few months generally have serious 
defects.<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a> And yet, their 
"prototype" had been tested for years, they had driven it in the Sahara and in 
Greenland, etc. But the time that has elapsed between the debut of the new 
manufactured product and the rolling-out of nearly satisfactory copies is the 
time needed for the mass of the factory's executants as a whole to give concrete 
form to initial manufacturing directives under real work conditions, to fill in 
the holes in the production plan, to resolve unforeseen problems, to adapt the 
manufacturing process to their own needs in their defence against exploitation 
(for example, to "make do" with the blueprint "specs" they are given), etc. 
Equilibrium between the production plan, the real state of the factory from the 
viewpoint of what is possible within the manufacturing process and the workers' 
struggle against exploitation thus is attained - until a new modification is 
introduced.</p>

<p class="fst">Management, of course, is "conscious" in general of these gaps 
between the production plan and what really goes on in the factory, and in 
principle it is supposed to fill them in itself. In practice, this obviously is 
not achievable: If each time something went wrong it was necessary to stop 
everything and ask for instructions back up the hierarchical chain of command, 
the factory would accomplish only a small portion of its production goals. Let 
it be said in passing that just because management is forced to tolerate the 
indispensable initiatives of the executants does not make the latter's role any 
easier. The managerial apparatus is both jealous of its prerogatives and 
completely fearful of its responsibilities; as much as it can, it will avoid 
tackling a question unless it is "covered," but it will harshly reproach its 
subordinates for having done so themselves. If the initiative succeeds, it will 
merely grumble, and then will try above all to grab the credit itself; if the 
initiative fails, it will deal with them severely.<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a> 
For the executant, the ideal attitude is for him to take initiatives that are 
really effective while making it seem like he is following all the official 
directives - though this is not always easy. The factory thus comes to 
constitute in places a double world - where people make it seem like they are 
doing one thing while doing another.</p>

<p class="fst">Both the foresight required for planning and the need for ongoing 
readjustment of the plan to a constantly evolving reality pose the problem of 
how to obtain information about what is going on in production. This problem 
quickly becomes insoluble for a bureaucratic managerial apparatus. The ultimate 
source of all information is the executants who are constantly engaged in the 
battle for production. Now, these people do not collaborate in the process; not 
only do they not necessarily inform management about the situation, but very 
often they are led into a tacit conspiracy to hide the real situation from 
management. The managerial apparatus can react to this only by creating special 
organs for obtaining information - which quickly run up against the same 
difficulty, since they too live to obtain original information from the outside. 
The conspiracy surrounding, the obtainment of information indeed is not limited 
to executants. The managerial apparatus itself participates in it. In fact, this 
is an essential aspect of the activity of its members. They make up the results 
of their own activity or the activity of the sector for which they are 
responsible. Their fate, the fate of their clan or their department depends upon 
it.<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Obtaining information, however, is not simply the gathering of 
"facts." It already is their choice, but it is also and much more their 
elaboration, the disentangling of the relationships and perspectives that tie 
facts together. This is impossible outside a conceptual framework, therefore 
outside a set of organized ideas, therefore outside a theory (even if it remains 
unconscious). Consequently, all information the managerial apparatus may have at 
its disposal is undermined by its theory of society - or of industrial reality. 
This is plainly apparent when we consider the bureaucratic apparatus that runs 
the entire society - the State or bureaucratic party. To run society presupposes 
that one knows it, and to know society signifies that one has an adequate 
theoretical conception of it. But today's leaders can try to grasp social 
reality only by subordinating it to absurd schemata. The same is true of their 
ideologists. Sometimes these ideologists plan out the operations of society, 
using the functioning of a mechanism as their model; at other times, when 
disheartened by the failure of this absurd attempt at comparison, they take 
refuge in irrationalism, the accidental and the arbitrary. We will encounter 
these problems again later.</p>

<p class="fst">The ruling apparatus of the enterprise is faced with the same 
questions and the same impossible options. The reality it needs to know is the 
reality of production. The latter is first and last a human reality. The most 
important facts are those that concern the situation, the activity, and the fate 
of people in the production process. Obviously, it is impossible to know these 
facts from the outside. Moreover, management does not bother itself very much 
about them. To the extent that it is obliged to worry about them, however, it 
can do so only by considering them as external facts, by transforming them into 
mechanical entities capable of being observed - in short, by destroying their 
very nature. In management's eyes, consequently, the worker either does not 
exist at all or else he exists only as a system of nerves and muscles capable of 
carrying out a certain quantity of gestures - gestures that can be increased in 
proportion to the amount of money he is promised. This entirely imaginary view 
of the worker is the basis for the "knowledge" of the reality of production that 
management possesses. In the manager's very gaze is incorporated, through a 
process of construction, the negation of the inherent [propre] reality of the 
object he claims to be looking at, for recognition of this inherent reality 
would imply, conversely, that the manager denies himself qua manager.</p>

<p class="fst">This situation hardly is modified at all when the crude old 
methods and the schema of "molecules irresistibly attracted by money" are 
abandoned in favour of more modern conceptions and the discoveries of industrial 
sociology. Only the nature of the "laws" supposed to rule people and their 
relations changes; the basic attitude remains the same. It no longer is assumed 
that the worker is capable of murdering his buddy and killing himself at his job 
for a few extra pennies - it now is assumed, quite to the contrary, that he is 
essentially determined by a "group solidarity." But in both cases, it is merely 
a matter of management's knowledge about the workers, and this knowledge is 
supposed to allow management to utilize them better for purposes of production. 
Group solidarity in its turn has become the new external motive determining the 
worker's acts; knowing the motive and acting upon it, one can bring the worker 
to do what is wanted of him. Management's situation still remains that of the 
engineer charged with laying out and ordering the assembly and operation of the 
parts of the human mechanism that make up the enterprise and of which he knows 
the laws. That the author of these laws is no longer Bentham, but Freud or Elton 
Mayo, changes nothing. And we need hardly add that it is still impossible to 
know industrial reality. Mired in this perspective and utilized toward these 
ends, psychology, psychoanalysis, and sociology are emptied of their content and 
transformed into their opposite.<a href="#n38" name="fn38" target="_self">[38]</a> 
That the group, for example, is not for its members an external motive, that it 
is the unity of self-determination creating and recreating itself, that thereby 
it sooner or later can only set itself against every kind of external management 
that tries to impose itself on this group - these truths can be of no service to 
management, for they challenge its very foundations. Management can possess only 
the theory of its own practice, i.e., of its social existence.</p>

<p class="fst">But contradictions that are just as insoluble tear apart the 
managerial apparatus, independently, so to speak, of its permanent struggle 
against the executants. A series of factors, all of which derive in the last 
analysis from the tendency to confine labourers to more and more limited tasks 
of execution, leads to an extraordinary proliferation within the managerial 
apparatus itself. Taking on itself a constantly increasing number of tasks, the 
managerial apparatus can exist only as an enormous collective organ. In a large 
enterprise, the individuals employed in offices and departments already 
constitute in themselves a sizable enterprise.<a href="#n39" name="fn39" target="_self">[39]</a> 
This collective organ itself undergoes a twofold division of labour within its 
own ranks. On the one hand, the managerial apparatus is subdivided into 
"specialized branches" - the various "services" in the enterprise's offices. On 
the other hand, within this apparatus as a whole and within each of these 
"services," the division between directors and executants inevitably is 
instaurated anew. By this very fact, all the aforementioned conflicts reappear 
within the managerial apparatus.</p>

<p class="fst">The organization of work within the managerial apparatus 
obviously can occur only under the same forms of "rationalization" as were 
applied to production proper: subdivision and compartmentalization of tasks, 
transformation of individuals into a mass of anonymous and interchangeable 
executants, etc. It engenders the same consequences in both places. In order to 
tame the workers' struggle, management thus ends up introducing the class 
struggle into its own ranks. Condemned to a compartmentalized job, deprived of 
all meaningful skills, reduced to salaries comparable to those paid to workers, 
deprived (in statistical terms) of any real chance of advancement, the vast 
majority of employees in the managerial apparatus now have trouble 
distinguishing themselves from their fellow workers on the shop floor; at 
bottom, only illusions that are being increasingly undermined by their real 
situation are capable of keeping them separate from the workers.<a href="#n40" name="fn40" target="_self">[40]</a> 
Independent of this process that unifies the various strata of executants in the 
enterprise, the principal result of the appearance of this mass of executants 
within the managerial apparatus is that management no longer has even itself at 
its own disposal; even if they are not in solidarity with the workers, vis--vis 
their work the lower strata of nonproduction employees have the same attitude as 
production workers.</p>

<p class="fst">On the other hand, the unavoidable fragmentation of the 
managerial apparatus into a series of specialized services inevitably creates a 
problem of reuniting the activities, methods, and viewpoints of these services. 
Each of them tends to champion its own viewpoint at the expense of the others, 
for this is the sole means by which it can assert its importance and enlarge its 
position within the apparatus. Now, the summit of the managerial apparatus, 
which is charged with resolving these conflicts, does not in general have any 
rational criterion for doing so. To do this, indeed, it would have to be able to 
take on itself all opposing points of view; i.e., it would have to in fact 
"duplicate" all the costly services that have been set up so laboriously. This 
is in fact the solution to which a number of managers are led: They surround 
themselves with an exclusive personal team, a sort of private and clandestine 
general staff.<a href="#n41" name="fn41" target="_self">[41]</a> Management thus 
is obliged to instaurate its own informal organization in opposition to the 
formal one it has already set up. However, it is obvious not only that these two 
solutions refute each other (either the clandestine general staff is useless or 
else it proves how useless a good part of the official departments are) but also 
that their juxtaposition can only be the source of new conflicts. And 
ultimately, top management does not run anything at all; it is reduced to 
arbitrating between opposing viewpoints and it does this in a truly arbitrary 
fashion, for it knows hardly anything about the problems in question. Logically 
speaking, its sole foundation now is merely that whatever decision it makes, 
even an arbitrary or absurd one, is more valuable than the total absence of 
decision making.<a href="#n42" name="fn42" target="_self">[42]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The absence of rational criteria capable of aiding in the 
resolution of conflicts between opposing points of view that arise unavoidably 
within management's bureaucratic apparatus is combined with another phenomenon 
of capital importance: the absence of rational criteria concerning the placement 
of individuals within this apparatus. These two factors are at the root of the 
traits that are characteristic of every modern bureaucratic apparatus: the 
struggle of all against all for "advancement," the formation of cliques and 
clans that dominate in a hidden [occulte] fashion the "official" life of the 
apparatus, and the transformation of objective options into stakes in the 
struggle between cliques and clans.</p>

<p class="fst">We must fully understand the meaning of this analysis of the 
contradictions of bureaucratic management. We are not comparing the latter to a 
perfect management in order to draw out the failings it exhibits in relation to 
such an imaginary standard. There is no perfect management, whatever the social 
structure (even if it be the organized collectivity of producers), and such a 
comparison would be completely meaningless. From every standpoint we have 
examined, a human management would encounter problems as well as difficulties as 
to how to solve such problems. The preceding discussion has no bearing on the 
possibility of eliminating these problems. It shows rather that the structure 
and the nature of the present form of management, which is a bureaucratic form 
of management external to the activities it is supposed to direct, make its 
problems insoluble, or at best, prevent its problems from being "resolved" 
except at the price of enormous wastefulness and perpetual crises.</p>

<p class="fst">Perfect foresight will never exist. And it need not exist for 
production to be organized rationally. The present structure, however, is 
implicitly based on the hypothesis that such foresight exists, and that 
management possesses it. Since in theory the producers are incapable of carrying 
out "on the job" the permanent readjustment of the plan to reality, this 
adjustment must be carried out a priori and once and for all by management. By 
virtue of this, the "production plan" - of the enterprise or of the entire 
economy - acquires an absolute value. Since the permanent process of making 
adjustments between foresight - without which there is no rational action - and 
reality is upset by the fact that managers are radically separated from 
executants, balance can be re-established in each instance only by fits and 
starts, and through specific, belated, spasmodic interventions.</p>

<p class="fst">The problem of obtaining adequate information will always exist. 
But the present structure renders the problem literally insoluble, for its very 
existence drives the whole of society to conspire to mask reality. The problem 
of making individuals adequate for the functions they fulfil will exist for a 
long time to come. But, by arranging these functions along a hierarchical 
pyramid, by tying not only the economic fate of the individual but also his 
total situation and ultimately his sense of self-worth to his success in a 
desperate and absurd struggle against everyone else, the present structure 
destroys all possibility of a rational solution. Human society will always be 
faced with options that are not geometrical problems admitting of a single, 
unique solution at the end of one rigorously defined path. But the present 
structure either fails to pose these problems explicitly or resolves them in 
terms of factors that are external to their content.</p>

<p class="fst">Now, unless there is a radical overthrow of the present 
structure, this separate type of management is inevitable. The activities of 
thousands of individuals and elementary groups have to be coordinated in one 
fashion or another. The "universal" point of view of the enterprise's operation 
has to prevail over the "particular" viewpoints of the workers or of their 
groups. Ultimately, then, a particular group of managers has to take it upon 
themselves to impose this "universal" viewpoint upon the totality of producers. 
From then on, conflict is inevitable.</p>

<p class="fst">First of all, for each group of workers, the imperatives arising 
out of this "universal" standpoint of the management take the form of an 
arbitrarily imposed external law. Its justification cannot even be known, and by 
this very fact it therefore appears to be completely irrational. But 
management's "universal" point of view is in fact another particular point of 
view; this viewpoint, which is partial in both senses of the word [partial et 
partiel], is the viewpoint of a particular stratum that has access to only a 
part of reality, that lives a life apart from actual production, and that has 
its own interests to put forward. Inversely, the "particular" point of view of 
groups of producers is in fact a universal point of view. The point of view of 
each elementary group is found again in all the others. The norms arising within 
them are identical. The interests they try to advance are the same. Management 
endeavours to think about the actual reality of production. The producers are 
this actual reality itself. Taken in their totality, they embrace the totality 
of aspects of the activity of the enterprise - in fact, they are this totality.</p>

<p class="fst">But are they really? Can they, across the many shops and offices 
of the enterprise, actually form an organic unity? Are they not all riveted to 
specific places on the total machine of the workplace? Is not each of them 
deprived of a view of everything else and incapable of connecting with the 
overall living totality of the enterprise? An analysis can show their mutual 
identity, and it can combine them. But can they themselves become united? Only 
the analysis of working-class struggles can furnish an answer to these 
questions.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h10">The Working-Class Struggle against Alienation</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The capitalist organization of production is profoundly 
contradictory. Capitalist management claims it deals only with the individual 
worker, whereas in fact production is carried out by the collectivity of 
workers. It claims to reduce the worker to a limited and determined set of 
tasks, but it is obliged at the same time to rely upon the universal capacities 
he develops both as a function of and in opposition to the situation in which he 
is placed. By exhaustively defining in advance the methods by which these tasks 
are to be executed, it claims to remove from them every element involving 
managerial duties. But as such, an exhaustive definition always is impossible. 
Production can be carried out only insofar as the worker himself organizes his 
work and goes beyond his theoretical role of pure and simple executant.</p>

<p class="fst">The conflicts that result from this situation culminate in a 
veritable anarchy of production in each enterprise. But they create at the same 
time a contradictory situation and a contradictory attitude in the workers 
themselves. The conditions in which they are placed impel them to organize their 
production work in the most effective manner, to upgrade the machinery, to 
invent new processes, etc. The way capitalism organizes production obliges them 
to do so, for when something goes wrong it is the workers who pay (and who 
cannot defend themselves merely by pointing out that the factory is badly 
organized). On the other hand, however, as soon as they manifest themselves, the 
workers' organization and creativity are combated by the managerial apparatus. 
In any case, these qualities are continually being disrupted and butchered by 
this apparatus. Indeed, under present conditions, improvements in the 
organization and methods of production initiated by workers essentially profit 
capital, which often then seizes hold of them and turns them against the 
workers. The workers know it and consequently they restrict their participation 
in production, both consciously as well as unconsciously. They restrict their 
output; they keep their ideas to themselves; they make use of improvements on 
their individual machines that they carefully hide from the foremen; they 
organize among themselves to carry out their work, all the while keeping up a 
facade of respect for the official way they are supposed to organize their work 
- and so on.<a href="#n43" name="fn43" target="_self">[43]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This contradictory attitude on the part of the workers signifies 
that the insurmountable conflict that tears through capitalist society is 
transposed into the heart of the proletariat itself, into the behaviour of the 
individual worker as well as into the attitudes of the working class. It would 
be entirely wrong to represent the proletariat as a full positivity, like some 
kind of class that already bears within itself the solution to all problems and 
that an enemy class and a form of social organization that remains foreign alone 
prevent it from achieving such solutions. That would be both a demagogic 
mystification and a poor, superficial theory. Capitalism would not be able to 
continue to exist if the crisis it is undergoing did not have repercussions 
within the proletariat itself. The oppression, the exploitation, and the 
alienation created by capitalism express themselves in the working class through 
contradictions that till now it has not succeeded in overcoming. The positivity 
of the working class comes from the fact that it does not remain simply torn by 
these contradictions, but constantly struggles to overcome them and that, at the 
most diverse levels, the meaning [contenu] of this struggle is the autonomous 
organization of the working class, workers' management of production, and, 
ultimately, the reorganization of society.</p>

<p class="fst">Bureaucrats - and sometimes even revolutionary militants deformed 
by a narrow "Marxism" they have outgrown but have not been able to shed - do not 
want to see in the proletariat's struggles anything but a tendency toward 
improving its standard of living, or at best a struggle "against exploitation." 
But the proletariat's struggle is not and cannot be simply a struggle "against" 
exploitation; it necessarily tends to be a struggle for a new organization of 
the relations of production. These are only two aspects of the same thing, for 
the root of exploitation is the present organization of the relations of 
production. The worker can be exploited, i.e., the fruits of his labour can be 
expropriated from him, only insofar as the direction of his labour is 
expropriated from him. And the struggle against exploitation quickly places 
before him the problem of management. This always is true on the shop floor and 
periodically on the level of the factory and of society as a whole.</p>

<p class="fst">Usually one fixes one's eyes on the "historical" moments of 
proletarian action (revolutions and general strikes) or, at the very least, on 
what can be called its explicit organization and activity (trade unions, 
parties, big strikes). But these actions and organizations can be comprehended 
only as moments of a permanent process of action and organization that finds its 
origin in the depths of everyday life in the workplace and that can sustain 
itself and remain adequate to its intentions only on the condition that it 
continually returns to these depths. Under the title of implicit struggle we 
include this everyday activity and organization, the capital importance of which 
must henceforth be given full recognition. It is implicit in the proletariat's 
existence, in its very condition as being proletarian. The informal or 
elementary organization of workers is only one aspect of this struggle. 
Organization is only one logical moment of the process of struggle - and the 
same is true of action. Struggle includes action, organization, and the setting 
of objectives. Our purpose is much more general than the analysis of informal 
organization since it also includes both informal actions and informal 
objectives. This implicit struggle is only the flip side, one could say, of the 
proletariat's everyday work. Work in the capitalist enterprise does not occur 
without struggle. This situation follows directly from an organization of work 
based upon the opposition between directors and executants.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus, the capitalist organization of work tends to rely upon the 
definition of work norms. Workers struggle against these norms. In this 
struggle, only a "defence against exploitation" can be seen. But in fact, it 
contains infinitely more: Precisely because he is trying to defend himself 
against exploitation, the worker is obliged to demand the right to determine his 
own work pace and to refuse to be treated like a thing.</p>

<p class="fst">Once a norm is defined, problems are far from being settled. It 
is only the boundaries of a battlefield that have just been defined. In this 
battle, the battle over actual output, the workers are led to organize 
themselves, to invent new means of acting, and to define objectives. Nothing is 
given to them in advance; everything has to be created and conquered in the 
midst of struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">The dynamic of the sequence of objectives, organization, and 
means of action, is plain to see. The workers aim for the maximum amount of pay 
for "an honest day's work." This maximum has meaning only as a collective 
maximum - in other words, every attempt to reach a maximum amount of pay for an 
individual quickly is revealed to be illusory and ultimately is turned against 
the individual who made the attempt. The achievement of this initial objective 
implies the pursuit of the greatest possible amount of freedom within the given 
framework of the capitalist enterprise. It equally implies the pursuit of the 
maximum amount of real efficiency in production - an indispensable condition for 
achieving labour savings. The workers thereby are led to struggle against the 
entire set of methods for organizing production along capitalist lines. They are 
led equally to organize themselves in an "elementary" or "informal" fashion 
under forms that capitalism constantly breaks up and that they continually 
recreate.</p>

<p class="fst">We are not saying that the workers always or even most of the 
time achieve these objectives. In the last analysis, they cannot achieve them 
without smashing the capitalist organization of the enterprise - which is 
impossible without at the same time smashing the capitalist organization of 
society. Setbacks and defeats are inevitable phases in this process. But as long 
as the capitalist organization is there, the struggle will always be reborn from 
its ashes and will be led both by its own dynamic and by the objective dynamic 
of capitalist society to widen and deepen. This is the meaning of this struggle 
that we have been trying to bring out.</p>

<p class="fst">Neither are we saying that this meaning is simple, a state of 
grace automatically investing the working-class condition, a socialist apriority 
innate to proletarians. The proletariat is not socialist - it becomes so, or 
more exactly, it makes itself socialist. And, long before it came to appear as 
socialist by organizing itself into trade unions and parties with this name, it 
makes appear the embryonic elements of a new form of social organization, of a 
new type of behaviour and of a new human way of thinking, in its everyday life 
and in its daily struggle within the capitalist enterprise. It is upon this 
terrain that we will now begin to analyse the dynamic and the signification of 
working-class struggles.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h11">The Struggle over Output</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The tendency of workers to regulate their own work pace to the 
greatest extent possible - by combating management's norms, and then by 
"bending" these norms with all the means at their disposal - appears to 
management as "restricting output" or "restricting production." Faced with such 
curtailment, the classical "rational" counter response is "output-based wages" 
or "piece-rate wages."<a href="#n44" name="fn44" target="_self">[44]</a> The 
worker thus will be driven, "in his own interest," to increase output to the 
maximum. In doing so, he also will, incidentally, provide indications of what 
levels of output can be attained - which will make it possible to revise the 
norms downward when the time comes.</p>

<p class="fst">Industrial sociologists (mainly the Elton Mayo school) have 
criticized this method as "mechanistic" because it postulates that the worker is 
an "economic man" whose sole motive is getting the maximum amount of earnings 
whereas in reality other motives play a much more important role. This critique 
starts from a correct idea in order to come up with a false conclusion. It gets 
at the capitalist system as a whole, but falls far short of the problem that 
concerns us. Workers certainly are not "economic men." They behave exactly like 
"economic men," however, toward management. They pay management back in its own 
coin.</p>

<p class="fst">First of all, workers generally do not go for the efficiency 
bait, for experience teaches them that after a short period of receiving bonus 
pay a draconian reduction in the norms will supervene.<a href="#n45" name="fn45" target="_self">[45]</a> 
Next, they discover ways to get an increase in wages without a real or apparent 
increase in output.</p>

<p class="fst">In small- or medium-scale production with individual bonuses, the 
means used by workers are practically unstoppable. Taking as an example the shop 
described by an American author,<a href="#n46" name="fn46" target="_self">[46]</a> 
these means can be set forth as follows.</p>

<p class="fst">1. To avoid having the norms revised after output increases, the 
workers never show (which does not mean that they never attain) results 
surpassing 145-150 percent of the norm.</p>

<p class="fst">2. On the "gravy jobs," which represent nearly half the jobs done 
in the shop and which are defined by the possibility of going far beyond normal 
output, when the workers cannot "fix" the actual output so as not to appear to 
exceed these set maximums, they "loaf," either literally or figuratively. The 
resulting wastefulness is estimated by the author with the help of some long and 
involved, but quite conservative, calculations at around 40 percent of the 
workers' time - and that, in his opinion, is an "underestimation."</p>

<p class="fst">3. On the "stinkers," which represent the other half of the 
shop's jobs and which are defined by the fact that it is impossible to get a 
substantial pay bonus no matter how much effort is made (the cut-off point seems 
to be, in the case analysed by Roy, in the neighbourhood of 120 percent of the 
norm), the workers generally "goldbrick" and fall back on the base rate (the 
hourly rate determined in collective bargaining, whatever the output actually 
achieved). There is, nevertheless, an important exception: If the "stinker" in 
question comes in large lots or is a job that must be done often, there begins a 
relentless struggle with the time-study men to revise the norms.<a href="#n47" name="fn47" target="_self">[47]</a> 
The wastefulness brought about in such a case is, according to the author, 
comparable to that of the previous case.</p>

<p class="fst">4. The very existence of these two types of jobs (as well as 
other minor jobs paid by the hour: machinery setups, jobs for which norms have 
not yet been established, "reworking" defective pieces) gives the workers ample 
opportunities to increase their pay without their apparent output going beyond 
the "normal" rate. Thus, if a worker has a "gravy job" for four hours, during 
which he could work at 200 percent of the norm, and a "stinker" for four hours, 
during which he will not be able to work at the norm, he can choose between 
three options.</p>

<p class="fst">He can (a) follow management's formal rules, in which case he 
will make a twelve-hour wage (4 x 2 + 4 x 1) - with the certainty that a few 
days later the time allotted for the "gravy job" will be reduced. He can (b) 
hold back on the gravy job to 150 percent; he then will make a ten-hour wage (4 
x 1.5 + 4 x 1). Last, he can (c) work at 200 percent of the norm on the "gravy 
job" and at 100 percent on the other one, but report that the first job was 
carried out in 5'/3 hours and the second in 2% hours. It then will appear that 
the worker had worked at 150 percent of the norm in both cases, he will make a 
twelve-hour wage, the maximum amount of production will be carried out - and 
there will be no danger of the time allotments being reduced.<a href="#n48" name="fn48" target="_self">[48]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The worker can obtain a similar result by changing the apparent 
allocation of his time between the "gravy jobs" and jobs paid by the hour (with 
the difference that in this case he increases his pay without increasing 
production).</p>

<p class="fst">5. For the workers to be able to realize these possibilities, 
most of the work rules established by management have to be broken. In fact, the 
whole system of capitalist "rationalization" of labour is struck down by it; 
management loses the ability to determine the breakdown of the workers' hours 
between various jobs, and ultimately all its accounting procedures and 
calculations of profitability are utterly ruined. Therefore, management has to 
react and it can do so only by instaurating additional "controls." If these 
controls are "effective," they lead the workers toward solution (b) as described 
in 4 - namely, restriction of output, and hence wastefulness.</p>

<p class="fst">These controls, however, quickly become ineffective. If the 
inspectors remain in their offices, they basically can inspect nothing at all. 
This is the case with the time-study men, who are used in fact, according to 
Roy's phrase, as the true "hatchet men" of upper management: Though they are 
merciless against machine operators whom they find breaking the rules and get 
them dismissed immediately, these time-study men described by Roy appear only 
very rarely on the shop floor. If they are stationed in the shop, they cannot 
resist the continuous pressure of the operators for long.<a href="#n49" name="fn49" target="_self">[49]</a> Such is the case 
with the "time checkers" who are supposed to record the time at the beginning 
and the end of each job specifically to prevent any "fixing" of real output. 
Quite soon these time checkers themselves ask the operators, "When do you want 
me to check you?" In fact, not only production workers but all "service" 
employees who are in direct and continuous contact with them ("time checkers," 
tool-crib attendants, stock-chasers, setup men, inspectors, and ultimately even 
foremen) continually cooperate to a greater or lesser degree to break 
management's rules (which in their eyes, and objectively, are absurd) and to 
allow the workers to "figure the angles." "Figuring the angles" would be 
impossible without this constant cooperation involving all the parts of the 
managerial apparatus that are in ongoing contact with the producers.</p>

<p class="fst">Not being able to trust its human representatives, management is 
obliged once again to fall back on impersonal and abstract regulations. It 
introduces new regulations aimed at making the transgression of its rules 
"objectively impossible." But the objective observance of these new regulations 
of necessity depends in turn upon human control: Their effectiveness presupposes 
that the problem they are called upon to resolve is already resolved. From this 
standpoint, additional regulations are made in vain, for workers in cooperation 
with the lower strata of the "auxiliary services" quickly succeed in 
circumventing them.</p>

<p class="fst">But there is more: Most of the time these regulations introduce 
an additional degree of wastefulness and anarchy. The operators and the service 
employees are obliged by this very fact to devote part of their efforts not only 
to circumventing the regulations but to compensating for its irrational effects.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus, in the factory described by Donald Roy, in order to keep 
the machine operators from "figuring the angles" (allocating the apparent 
distribution of their time between different jobs as it suits them), management 
appoints "time checkers." In fact, the latter become the operators' allies and 
are turned against management. At a certain point, management decides to react 
and to make a "ruling" aimed at making the operators' "make-out angles" 
"objectively impossible." The "ruling" in question forbids the operators from 
keeping their tools and other auxiliary means of production (the "setups") next 
to their machines after a given job is finished as well as from getting what 
they need from the tool-crib attendants "in advance" (these two practices 
obviously being necessary to do any other work than what they are supposed to be 
doing). Tool orders in triplicate are used to guarantee adequate monitoring. At 
the end of each shift, the work-order card and all tool setups have to be turned 
in to the tool-crib attendants, whether the job is finished or not. The setup 
work then has to be started all over again by the next shift.</p>

<p class="fst">The rule's effects - which indeed have been foreseen by 
experienced workers - are not long in coming: a considerable increase in the 
tool-crib attendants' workload resulting both from increased paperwork and from 
the need to reassemble and re-sort the requested tools after each shift (up 
until then, the machine operators and setup men served themselves from the tool 
crib); also, there is a considerable loss of time for the workers and long lines 
begin to form at the tool crib. But management's desired result is not achieved: 
The triplicate forms ire filled out and exchanged each time - but the tool-crib 
attendants continue to supply the operators in advance with their tools.</p>

<p class="fst">Faced with this situation, management, four months later, 
modifies its first rule with a second one. To avoid long lines forming in front 
of the crib the shifts no longer are obliged to turn in their work-order cards 
and tools at the end of their workday, but tools can be furnished from then on 
only upon an order in duplicate from the "time checkers." At the same time, the 
inspectors have to countersign the time a job ends before a new work order can 
be obtained (this is done to permit a cross-check of the times marked by the 
"time checkers" and the inspectors).</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, the second rule also results merely in increased 
paperwork for the tool-crib attendants. The setup men, who are allowed to go 
into the tool crib, pick up setups ahead of time for the operators. The 
inspectors quickly fall in step and "countersign" the time cards as requested by 
the operators. The shop gets back into a routine again, under slightly different 
procedures - and with a notable increase in the production of pink, white, and 
blue paper.</p>

<p class="fst">Management does not let itself get discouraged. It publishes a 
third "ruling" officially forbidding anyone from going into the tool crib except 
the tool-crib employees and two superintendents. The order, signed by Faulkner, 
the director of the factory, is posted on the tool-crib door.</p>

<p class="fst">An old machine operator, Hank, predicts that the new order "won't 
last out the week," and a setup man explains why its effects will be tough on 
the grinders and crib attendants, because setup men and foremen have been doing 
much of the [tool] grinding and have made it easier for them by coming in to 
help themselves to tools, jigs, etc.</p>

<p class="fst">A new line forms in front of the crib as a result of the third 
rule. The foremen are furious, they yell at the crib attendants and warn them 
that they will make out allowance cards charging them for every minute of time 
the workers are delayed because they do not have their tools. The boys who are 
standing in line at the crib window growl or wisecrack about the crib 
attendants.</p>

<p class="fst">Then Jonesy, the most conscientious and most efficient of the 
crib attendants, declares that he has "had enough" and lets foremen and setup 
men back into the crib again. The notes taken the same evening by D. Roy are 
worth citing verbatim.</p>

<p class="fst">Just ten days after the new order was promulgated, the sun began 
to break through the dark clouds of managerial efficiency. Hank's prediction was 
off by four days. ... Johnny (setup man) and others seemed to be going in and 
out of the crib again, almost at will. ... When I asked Walt (crib attendant) 
for some jaws to fit the chuck I had found, he said: "We've got lots of jaws 
back here, but I wouldn't know what to look for. You'd better get the setup man 
to come back here and find you some." Walt said to me: "I break the rules here, 
but not too much - just within reason to keep the boys on production. Faulkner's 
order still hangs at eye level on the crib door. ...</p>

<p class="fst">"And so much for Faulkner's order!" The "fix" was "on" again, and 
operators and their service-group allies conducted business as usual for the 
remaining weeks of the writer's employment.</p>

<p class="fst">The dialectic of this situation can be summed up easily in a 
certain number of moments of universal import. The essential element in 
production costs is human labour (in any case, the sole element upon which 
management can or thinks it can continually act: the others depend on factors 
that for the most part are beyond its control). Management seeks to reduce its 
costs by trying to obtain maximum output with minimum pay. The workers want to 
get maximum pay by providing what they consider a fair amount of output. Whence 
the fundamental conflict over the content of the work hour.</p>

<p class="fst">Management tries to overcome this conflict through' 
'rationalization," through a strict definition of the amount of effort to be 
provided by the workers, tying their pay to the amount of production attained. 
This "rationalization" only makes the initial conflict grow and blossom into a 
number of specific conflicts: over the setting of norms, the concrete 
application of such norms, the quality of tools and machinery and their 
depreciation, the application of regulations aimed at organizing work from 
management's viewpoint.</p>

<p class="fst">The initial conflict, far from being overcome, is broadened at 
the same time as it is deepened, for management's successive counter responses 
force the workers to put all aspects of the organization of labour into 
question. At the same time, the overhead costs of capitalist management are 
considerably increased: voluntary restriction of output on the part of the 
workers, time taken up merely struggling against norms and regulations, 
multiplication of auxiliary services and in particular "supervisory" services 
that in each instance have to be rechecked by others, etc.<a href="#r1" name="rn1" target="_self">[A*]</a></p>

within quotation marks and in parentheses.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> With the addition of various 
other factors, like the percentages allotted for "taking account of unforeseen 
possibilities" - which in fact can be assessed only empirically and arbitrarily 
and which thereby ruin the alleged "rationality" of the rest.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n7" href="#fn7">[7]</a> We are talking about scientific 
management insofar as it applies to the problems of output by human beings. As 
production engineers, the Taylorists were able to play a positive role in a host 
of domains concerning the material rationalization of production - and sometimes 
also the rationalization of human motion by making known to others the most 
economical methods, as picked up from individual workers.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n8" href="#fn8">[8]</a> Thus a strike breaks out in an 
enterprise following an average 20 percent reduction in time allowances in the 
assembly shop. Among other issues, the shop stewards brought up the fact that 
"components were now supplied in bulk, whereas previously they had been sorted 
and laid out in a carrier; moreover, frequent stoppages were caused by bad 
supply arrangements at assembly points, which penalized workers paid on an 
output basis" (R. J. Jouffret, "Description of Two Cases in Which Human 
Relations in Industry Were Impaired by the Efficient Use of Time Study in 
Determining Production Bonuses," in Human Relations in Industry [Paris: European 
Productivity Agency, 1956], p. 202). Such situations exist everywhere.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n9" href="#fn9">[9]</a> Jouffret, ibid., p. 201. The 
times noted are adjusted to the "normal (performance) rates" and "rest 
coefficients," which can be based only upon the time-study engineers' 
estimations.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n10" href="#fn10">[10]</a> Here we have one of the 
"findings" of the famous Hawthorne factory experiments conducted in the United 
States from 1924 to 1927 under the direction of Elton Mayo: "It was found that 
the more intelligent the girl, the greater was the number of variations (in her 
movements)." J. A. C. Brown, The Social Psychology of Industry (London: Penguin, 
1956), p. 72.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n11" href="#fn11">[11]</a> The "objective-scientific" 
measurability of labor-time aimed at by Taylorism "extends right into the 
workers' 'soul': even his psychological attributes are separated from his total 
personality and placed in opposition to it so as to facilitate their integration 
into specialized rational systems and their reduction to statistically viable 
concepts. ... In consequence of the rationalization of the work-processes, the 
human qualities and idiosyncrasies appear increasingly as mere sources of errors 
(G. Lukcs, History and Class Consciousness [Cambridge: MIT Press, 1971], p. 
88.)</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n12" href="#fn12">[12]</a> See the summary of this 
critique in J. A. C. Brown, The Social Psychology of Industry, chapters 1 and 3. 
Speaking of Taylorism, Alain Touraine writes (L'Evolution du travail ouvrier aux 
usines Renault [Paris: CNRS, 1955], p. 115): "Since Taylor, personnel 
administrators have striven to stop (the workers) from 'loafing,' but Taylor's 
pseudoscientific and purely coercive methods today are condemned; the importance 
of human relations, of communications, of informal organization, i.e., of social 
adjustment [T/E: Touraine places the English phrase 'social adjustment' in 
parentheses and in italics, following the phrase 'integration sociale'] of the 
worker into the enterprise, has become the principal theme of American Personnel 
Management." [T/E: "Personnel Management" appears in English.] But what value is 
there in condemning Taylor when it is well known that the great majority of 
French businesses pay workers on an output basis, using time-motion studies (R. 
J- Jouffret, "Description," p. 200)? In fact, as we shall see, management has 
responded to the bankruptcy of Taylorism with more and not with less coercion. 
As for "human relations," we will come to it later.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n13" href="#fn13">[13]</a> The first person to 
experience this struggle obviously was Taylor himself. Speaking of the first 
years of his career, when he himself applied his method in factories, he wrote, 
"I was a great deal older than I am now, what with the worry, meanness, and 
contemptibleness of the whole damn thing. It's a horrid life for any man to live 
not being able to look any workman in the face without seeing hostility there, 
and a feeling that every man around you is your virtual enemy" (cited by J. A. 
C. Brown, 'The Social Psychology of Industry, p. 14). See a description of the 
workers' attitude toward time-study men in Georges Vivier, "La Vie en usine," 
Socialisme ou Barbarie, 12 (August 1953), pp. 38 and 40, Daniel Mothe, "L'Usine 
et la gestion ouvire," ibid., 22 (July 1957), pp. 90-92 [partially reproduced 
in Journal d'un ouvrier (Paris: Minuit, 1959]; Paul Romano, "L'Ouvrier 
americain," ibid., 2 (May 1949), pp. 84-85 [T/E: "Life in the Factory," in 
Romano and Stone, <a href="http://www.prole.info/texts/americanworker1.html" target="_blank">The American Worker</a> (1947; reprinted, Detroit, Bewick 
Editions, 1972), p. 9]: "When the time-study men are about, the worker will find 
a multitude of reasons for shutting the machine down." The systematic slowdown 
of work performed in front of the time-study men is a universal rule. When time 
studies are done, the workers switch to lower speeds and slower "feeds" than the 
ones they will use later on; "operators deemed it necessary to embellish the 
timing performance with movements ... that could be dropped instanter with the 
departure of the time-study man" (Donald Roy, "Efficiency and 'The Fix,"' 
American Journal of Sociology, 60 [November 1954], pp. 255-66).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n14" href="#fn14">[14]</a> R. J. Jouffret, 
"Description," p. 201. The idea that the workers "should normally" accept 
revisions in the hotted times is all the more astonishing since the author 
himself shows that the revision that provoked the conflict ended up stealing 
from the workers at least 10 percent of their time and since he concludes his 
study by saying that in this firm "the lack of confidence felt by the workers in 
the procedure of the Methods Department proved to be largely justified as a 
result of the joint survey subsequent to the dispute."</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n18" href="#fn18">[18]</a> Donald Roy, "Quota 
Restriction and Goldbricking in a Machine Shop," American Journal of Sociology, 
57 (March 1952), pp. 427-42. It should be noted that the entire analysis of the 
"Hawthorne experiment" made by the Elton Mayo school is based on the assumption 
that workers in the shops studied had no "rational reason" for restricting their 
output and that it therefore was necessary to find "nonlogical" motives for 
their behaviour. Roy remarks in this regard: "John Mills, onetime research 
engineer in telephony and for five years engaged in personnel work for Bell 
Telephone Company, has recently indicated the possibility that there were 
factors in the bank-wiring room situation which the Mayo group failed to detect: 
'Reward is supposed to be in direct proportion to production. Well, I remember 
the first time I ever got behind that fiction. I was visiting the Western 
Electric Company, which had a reputation of never cutting a piece rate. It never 
did; if some manufacturing process was found to pay more than seemed right for 
the class of labour employed on it - if, in other words, the rate-setters had 
misjudged - that particular part was referred to the engineers for redesign, and 
then a new rate was set on the new part. Workers, in other words, were paid as a 
class, they were supposed to make about so much a week with their best efforts 
and, of course, less for less competent efforts' (The Engineer in Society [New 
York: Van Nosirand, 1946], p. 93)." (Quoted by Roy, "Quota Restriction," p. 
431.) Let us add that the Mayo research group literally lived in the shop in 
question for five years and that it claimed to be studying reality without any 
pre-established theoretical schema, without any "preconceived ideas." This is 
what allowed them to rediscover in reality their unconscious ideas (for example, 
that management is always logical, and that, if the workers oppose management, 
it can only be for "nonlogical" reasons) and to ignore facts as massive as those 
mentioned by Mills.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n19" href="#fn19">[19]</a> On conflicts over quality 
control, see Mothe's article, "L'Usine et la gestion ouvrire," in 5. ou B., 22 
(July 1957), particularly p. 103. "To succeed in 'earning a living' (i.e., in 
not exceeding your time allotments), one has to cut corners on quality, 
eliminate an operation here and there. In the factory, this currently is called 
'sabotage'" (G. Vivier, Socialisme ou Barbarie, 14 [April 1954], p. 57). This 
cutting of corners is the "streamlining" [T/E: the word appears italicized and 
in English in the original] of American factory parlance; cf. Roy, "Efficiency 
and the 'Fix,'" p. 257. On the contradictions, the resort to empirical methods, 
and the proliferation of piecework-related supervisory services, see Touraine, 
L'Evolution, pp. 169-70. Touraine concludes that ultimately "the unwieldiness of 
supervisory controls poses the question of returning to self-control," i.e., 
quality control over pieces by the semiskilled workers who manufacture them. It 
is not difficult to see that such an apparently minuscule change is impossible 
without a total overthrow of the structure of the factory, of wages, of the 
relations between the worker and his work.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n21" href="#fn21">[21]</a> These are what Anglo-Saxon 
sociologists call "informal groups" or "primary groups." [T/E: In the original, 
Castoriadis gives the French translation of these two phrases. We have retained 
throughout his phrase, "elementary groups," to distinguish his analysis from 
that of these "Anglo-Saxon sociologists."]</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n22" href="#fn22">[22]</a> We shall see later that the 
divergence between the workers' spontaneous organization and the factory's 
official organization is, from a certain point of view, the condensed expression 
of all the conflicts and of all the contradictions of the capitalist enterprise.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n23" href="#fn23">[23]</a> The study of elementary 
groups goes back to Charles H. Cooley (Human Nature and the Social Order [1902; 
reprinted, New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Books, 1983]). Its application to 
industrial sociology is tied to the works of Elton Mayo and his school. See, in 
particular, Elton Mayo, The Social Problems of an Industrial Civilization (1945; 
reprinted, Salem, N.H.: Ayer, 1977).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n24" href="#fn24">[24]</a> Mayo, Social Problems, 
Chapter 2, "The Rabble Hypothesis and Its Corollary, the State Absolute."</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n25" href="#fn25">[25]</a> T/E: Castoriadis uses the 
English phrase "rabble hypothesis" in italics, followed by the French phrase 
"postulat de la horde." What we have translated as "the molecular hypothesis" is 
what he calls the "postulat molculaire."</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n26" href="#fn26">[26]</a> Remark by Philippe Guillaume.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n27" href="#fn27">[27]</a> Unless, once again, such 
"recognition" [reconnoitre] means inviting management to utilize its 
"acquaintances [connaissances]" in such groups in order to worm its way into 
them, the better to combat them. Contemporary American literature and cinema 
offer many examples of this type of utilization: Thus in the film Blackboard 
Jungle, an elementary group is broken up by discrediting the "ringleader" in the 
eyes of its members.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n28" href="#fn28">[28]</a> We are thinking in particular 
of Mayo, but the same can be said of all of industrial sociology. Thus Brown, in 
his excellent synthesis of industrial sociology already cited, persistently 
recapitulates the criticisms developed by several writers in this regard against 
Mayo and emphasizes that elementary groups have their own logic, in no way 
"inferior" to management's logic, but he remains unable to get himself out of 
the contradiction as thus stated. And for good reason, for the only way out is 
workers' management - obviously an "unscientific" idea for a sociologist.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n29" href="#fn29">[29]</a> See the extraordinarily vivid 
description of this informal organization in the Renault factories by Mothe, 
"L'Usine et la gestion ouvrire," in particular pp. 81-90, 101-2, and 106-10.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n30" href="#fn30">[30]</a> An informal organization also 
exists, of course, at higher echelons in the management apparatus - but, as will 
be seen later, it obeys another type of logic than that of an informal 
organization of executants.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n31" href="#fn31">[31]</a> See a description of this 
kind of cooperation in Mothe's "L'Usine," as well as the long quotations from 
Roy that we provide later.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n32" href="#fn32">[32]</a> Of course, it is not a matter 
here of separate time periods, but of simultaneous facets, of logical moments in 
the process of organizing production.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n33" href="#fn33">[33]</a> See in this regard Mothe's 
long exposition in "L'Usine"; likewise those of Vivier (Socialisme ou Barbarie, 
12 [August 1953], pp. 46-47, 14 [April 1954], pp. 56-57) and of Paul Romano 
(ibid., 2 [May 1949], pp. 89-91 [T/E: 1972 American edition, pp. 12-14].)</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n34" href="#fn34">[34]</a> Cf. N. Wiener, Cybernetics 
(New York: Wiley, 1948), pp. 172-73.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n35" href="#fn35">[35]</a> "After each model change, the 
supervisors frenetically run through the factory trying to get the plans and 
machinery which have been studied for months in the offices to work normally. At 
this moment the foreman is boss; he puts the workers where he wants, he breaks 
up old groups, he asserts his authority. It is the moment of greatest 
disorganization in the factory. For precisely this reason few Detroit 
autoworkers will buy a new car immediately after the model changes. They leave 
this lemon to people who don't work in a factory and therefore don't know any 
better. It is only when the workers are able to reestablish a certain amount of 
order in production that things go smoothly. The foreman has been put in charge 
of a group of workers and he is told what he should make them do. The 
organization he brings about is always bad. The assembly line goes too quickly 
or else there is only a single man where there should be two. The workers 
explain that to him, but he has his orders and cannot make any changes based on 
what the workers say. The men therefore are obliged to take the situation in 
hand themselves. They screw up the work so that the assembly line has to be 
stopped. Finally, after this situation has gone on for some time, management 
wises up, production is adjusted, and the cars produced are worth the price of 
purchase" (The American Civilization, monotyped text produced by the American 
group from Detroit, Correspondence, p. 47; [T/E: despite a long search, no copy 
of this text has been found; we therefore have retranslated Castoriadis's French 
back into English.])</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n36" href="#fn36">[36]</a> See Mothe, "L'Usine," p. 88.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n37" href="#fn37">[37]</a> See RPB, in SB 1, pp. 279-81 
[T/E: see "The Proletarian Revolution against the Bureaucracy," this volume, the 
third unnumbered subsection of the section entitled "Bureaucratic Planning"].</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n38" href="#fn38">[38]</a> For example, every form of 
psychoanalysis worthy of the name is based on the idea that the freedom of the 
subject is at one and the same time the end and the means of the therapeutic 
process - and every utilization of psychoanalysis by industrial sociology is 
based on the manipulation of the subject, both as means and as ultimate end.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n39" href="#fn39">[39]</a> In the Renault factories, the 
percentage of "monthly salaried workers" went from 6.5 of the total in 1919 to 
11.7 in 1930, 17.8 in 1937, and 20.2 in January 1954 (Touraine, L'Evolution, pp 
164-65). On the development of offices in American industry, see C. Wright 
Mills, White Collar (New York: Oxford University Press, 1956), pp. 65-70.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n40" href="#fn40">[40]</a> In this regard, the analysis 
of the attitude of these strata, as furnished by C. Wright Mills in the final 
chapters of his White Collar, has the following shortcomings:<a href="#n1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
It mixes disparate categories of "white-collar proletarians" whose situations 
and outlooks differ fundamentally; and<a href="#n2" target="_self">[2]</a> 
it does not take into account the dynamic of their situation. In particular, 
illusions about "status" will not outlive for long the real conditions that once 
had nourished them. The phenomenon of the industrialization of office work 
obviously is of decisive importance in this regard. Cf. R. Berthier's excellent 
analysis, "Une Experience d'organisation ouvriere," in 5. ou B., 20 (December 
1956), pp. 6 ff.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n41" href="#fn41">[41]</a> At an entirely different 
level, this phenomenon of "duplicating" the bureaucratic structure that blankets 
all of society with a more exclusive managing organ, the Party (which 
unsuccessfully tries to be the authoritative seat of reunification and thereby 
also tends to render the State's entire bureaucratic apparatus useless) has been 
brought to light by Claude Lefort, starting off from the speeches of the 
Twentieth Congress of the CPSU. See, in 5. ou B., 19 (July 1956), his article 
"Le Totalitarisme sans Staline," in particular pp. 45 ff. [now in Elements, pp. 
166 ff.; T/E: 1979 ed., pp. 203 ff.]. Let us add that in duplicating the 
structure of the State bureaucracy, the Party is obliged to reproduce it within 
its own ranks, creating specialized commissions, etc. That is to say, this is no 
solution to the problem, by near or by far.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n42" href="#fn42">[42]</a> On the necessary incompetence 
of managers within the present system, see C. Wright Mills, The Power Elite (New 
York: Oxford University Press, 1956), especially pp. 138-46 as concerns managers 
of industry, pp. 205-24 as concerns military leaders, and the final chapter of 
the book.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n43" href="#fn43">[43]</a> See the articles by Romano, 
Vivier, and Mothe already cited. Noting the relatively small number of 
"suggestions" from workers that are aimed at improving production, Touraine 
writes: "How is this relative failure to be explained? In the first place by 
remembrance of the past. The worker, used to seeing his suggestions and his 
initiatives turned back against him when the time-study men are called in, 
abandons his former mistrust only slowly" (L'Evolulion, p. 121). "To abandon 
slowly" is a euphemism: The figures cited by Touraine refer to the period 
1945-47. What has happened since then has not prompted the workers to abandon 
their mistrust. Quite the contrary.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n44" href="#fn44">[44]</a> The types, formulas, and 
names for "wages based on output" are innumerable. But as far as we are 
concerned here, only the general meaning [contenu] of these formulas matters: 
The worker's wage is, within ample limits, a function of the quantity of 
production provided.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n45" href="#fn45">[45]</a> One of the workers in the 
shop where Roy worked said to him, "Don't you know that if I turned in $1.50 an 
hour on these pump bodies tonight, the whole God-damned Methods Department would 
be down here tomorrow! And they'd retime this job so quick it would make your 
head swim! And when they'd retime it, they'd cut the price in half?"</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n46" href="#fn46">[46]</a> Roy, in his articles cited 
earlier.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n47" href="#fn47">[47]</a> Roy describes at length an 
epic struggle in such a case between the four best workers in the shop and the 
time-study men, a struggle that lasted nine months and only came to an end when 
the workers won. This outcome makes one think - just as Mothe's remarks 
("L'Usine," pp. 91-92) do - that the great majority of jobs are "stinkers" at 
the outset and that it is the workers' struggle against the time allotments that 
progressively transforms them into "gravy jobs."</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n48" href="#fn48">[48]</a> This third option, very 
likely applied as soon as the conditions for it are given, corresponds exactly 
to the concept of "maximization of profits in the long run" recently discovered 
by bourgeois economists as the principle that ought to guide the decision making 
of capitalist entrepreneurs.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n49" href="#fn49">[49]</a> Let us recall that the 
stomach ulcer is the occupational illness of the foreman.</p>

<h3><a name="h13">Remarks:</a></h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="r1" href="#rn1">[A*]</a> This text - of which the first part, a sort of programmatic 
introduction, was published in July 1955 in <i>S. ou B.</i>, no. 17, and whose second 
part was devoted to a discussion of the problems of a socialist society, in 
issue no. 22 (July 1957) - continued with an analysis of the proletariat's 
political struggles, a critique of the overall organization of capitalist 
society, and an analysis of the crisis of contemporary culture. Events (May 
1958, the scission within the S. ou B. group) interrupted its elaboration and 
publication. Parts of the first draft have been used in the writing of PO I, 
MRCM/MCR, and MTR/MRT. [T/E: The first two texts are included in this volume; 
the third is to be found in IIS.]</p>
