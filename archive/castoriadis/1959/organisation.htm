<h2><a name="h1">Introduction</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The organizations created by the working class for its liberation 
have become cogs in the system of exploitation. This is the brutal conclusion 
forced upon anyone who is prepared to face up to reality. One consequence is 
that today many are perplexed by an apparent dilemma. Can one become involved 
without organization? And if one cannot, how can one organize without following 
the path that has made traditional organizations the fiercest enemies of the 
aims they originally set out to achieve?</p>

<p class="fst">Some believe the question can be approached in a purely negative 
way. "Experience shows," they say, "that all working-class organizations have 
degenerated; therefore, any organization is bound to degenerate." This is basing 
too much on experience - or too little. Up to now all revolutions either have 
been crushed or have degenerated. Are we to deduce from this that all 
revolutionary struggle should be abandoned? The defeat of revolutions and the 
degeneration of organizations are different expressions of the same phenomenon, 
namely, that established society is, at least provisionally, emerging victorious 
from its struggles with the proletariat. If one concluded that things will 
always be like this, one ought to be logical and give up the fight. Concern with 
the problem of organization has meaning only for people convinced that they can 
and must struggle together (hence, by organizing) and who do not, from the very 
beginning, assume their own defeat is inevitable.</p>

<p class="fst">For such people the questions posed by the degeneration of 
working-class organizations have a real, positive meaning and demand real 
answers. Why have these organizations degenerated? What does this degeneration 
mean? What has been the role of these organizations in the temporary setback of 
the labour movement? Why has the proletariat supported them? And, perhaps more 
significantly, why has it not moved beyond them? What are the conclusions from 
all this for future organization and action?</p>

<p class="fst">There is no simple answer to these questions, for they concern 
every aspect and task of the labour movement today. Nor is there a purely 
theoretical answer. The problem of revolutionary organization will only be 
resolved as such an organization is actually built. This in turn will depend on 
the development of working-class action.</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, the beginnings of a solution should be attempted 
right now. Revolutionaries cannot totally abstain from action and wait for 
working-class struggles to develop. The development of such struggles will not 
solve the problem of how revolutionaries should organize: They will merely bring 
it up at a higher level. And in the development of these struggles, organization 
has a role to play. No real organization will be built without the development 
of struggles, and there will be no lasting development of these struggles 
without organization building. If you do not accept this postulate, if you think 
that what you do or do not do is of no importance, if you are acting purely so 
as to be at peace with your own conscience, there is no need to read further.</p>

<p class="fst">The beginnings of a solution cannot be empirical or just a set of 
negative prescriptions. A revolutionary group can only adopt positive rules for 
its action and work, and these rules must spring from its principles. However 
insignificant the organization, its work, its activity, and its way of going 
about its daily business must be the visible and verifiable embodiment of the 
aims it advocates.</p>

<p class="fst">Responding to the problem of building a revolutionary 
organization demands, therefore, that we start from the whole experience of the 
revolutionary movement and from an analysis of the conditions in which the 
movement finds itself in the second half of the twentieth century. In order to 
do this we must make what may seem like a detour, return to first principles and 
reconsider revolutionary objectives and the history of the labour movement.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<h2><a name="h2">1. Socialism: Management of Society by the Workers</a></h2>

<p class="fst">One fact, because of its direct and indirect consequences, has 
dominated human history in the twentieth century: The working class carried 
through a revolution in Russia in 1917. Far from leading to socialism, however, 
the revolution finally resulted in the coming to power of a new exploiting 
class: the bureaucracy. Why, and how, did this happen?<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1917 the Russian proletariat mobilized itself to destroy the 
power of the Czar and of the capitalists and to put an end to exploitation. It 
took up arms and organized itself in factory committees and soviets to conduct 
this struggle. But when, after a long civil war, the remnants of the old regime 
had been cleared away, economic and political power were once more found to be 
concentrated in the hands of a new group of leaders, centered around the 
Bolshevik party. The proletariat did not take over the management of the new 
society - which is another way of saying that the working class did not itself 
become the ruling class. From that moment on, it could only once again resume 
its position as an exploited class. The degeneration of the Russian revolution 
was nothing other than the return to a position of supremacy of a specific and 
restricted social stratum.</p>

<p class="fst">The various factors that led to this degeneration all have, when 
it comes down to it, the same underlying significance. The proletariat did not 
take on the direction of the revolution and of the society that emerged from it. 
From the very beginning, it was the Bolshevik party that strove to wield 
complete power over the country, and very quickly it succeeded in doing so. The 
Party constituted itself based on the idea that it provided a natural leadership 
for the proletariat and was the expression of its historical interests. But the 
ideas and attitudes of the Bolshevik party could never have prevailed had not 
the working class itself, in its great majority, shared them and had it not 
tended to see the party as a necessary organ of its power. And so the organs 
that ought to have expressed the political supremacy of the toiling masses, the 
soviets, were rapidly transformed into appendages of Bolshevik power.</p>

<p class="fst">And yet, even if this development had not occurred in the 
political sphere, nothing fundamental would have changed, for the revolution did 
not bring about any profound change in the real relations of production. With 
the private owners expropriated or exiled, the Bolshevik state entrusted the 
running of enterprises to managers nominated by itself, and it fought the few 
attempts made by workers to seize control of the management of production. But 
those who are masters of production are, in the last analysis, masters of policy 
and society. A new group of industrial and economic leaders rapidly developed, 
which, fusing with the leadership of the Party and of the State, constituted a 
new ruling class.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The basic lesson of the experience of the Russian revolution is 
therefore that it is not enough for the proletariat to destroy the governmental 
and economic domination of the bourgeoisie. It can only achieve the objective of 
its revolution if it builds up its own power in every sphere. If the direction 
of production, of the economy, and of the "State" again becomes the function of 
a particular category of individuals, inevitably the exploitation and oppression 
of workers will return. With these, the permanent crisis that divides 
contemporary society will arise again, for it owes its origin to the conflict at 
the point of production between directors and executants.</p>

<p class="fst">Socialism is not and cannot be anything other than the management 
of production, the economy, and society by the workers. This idea has from the 
very beginning constituted the central thesis of <i>Socialisme ou Barbarie</i>. 
The Hungarian revolution has since provided a striking confirmation of it.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">The Autonomy of the Proletariat</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The idea of workers' management of production and society implies 
that power in post-revolutionary society will be solely and directly in the 
hands of the workers' mass organs (the councils). There can be no question of 
special organs of any sort - for example, political parties - taking on the 
functions of governance and the exercise of power. But this idea is not a simple 
"constitutional" proposition. It necessitates a reconsideration of all the 
theoretical and practical problems facing the revolutionary movement.</p>

<p class="fst">It would indeed be nonsense to talk of workers' management if 
workers were incapable of it and thereby incapable of generating new principles 
for the organization and orientation of social life. Revolution and, even more, 
the construction of a socialist society presuppose that the organized mass of 
workers have become capable of managing the whole of society's activities 
without intermediaries - and therefore that they have become capable of 
directing themselves in all respects and in a permanent fashion. Socialist 
revolution can only be the outcome of <i>autonomous</i> activity on the part of 
the proletariat, "autonomous" signifying "self-directing" and "responsible only 
to itself."</p>

<p class="fst">This question must not be confused with the question of the 
technical capacity of the proletariat to manage production.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> The proletariat 
consists of all exploited wage earners and salaried employees. It is the 
collective producer. Technical knowledge has long ceased to be the monopoly of a 
few individuals. Today it is diffused among a mass of office and lab workers who 
are daily submitted to a greater and greater division of labour and who receive 
salaries only slightly higher than those of manual workers. Technician-bosses 
are just as superfluous as foremen in production. They are not great 
irreplaceable engineers but bureaucrats who direct and "organize" (i.e., 
disorganize) the work of the mass of salaried technicians. Together the 
exploited workers in factories and offices possess in themselves all the 
technical skills known to humanity today. For the proletariat in power, the 
question of the "technical" orientation of production will therefore not be a 
technical question at all, but rather a political question of the unity of 
workers on the shop floor and in offices, of cooperation between them, and of 
collective management of production. And, in the same way, the proletariat will 
be faced with political questions in every sphere including the problems of its 
own organization, of the proper balance between centralization and 
decentralization, of the general orientation of production and society, of 
relations with other social groups (the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie), of 
international relations, etc.</p>

<p class="fst">Socialism, therefore, presupposes a high degree of social and 
political consciousness among the proletariat. It cannot arise out of a mere 
revolt against exploitation but only from the capacity of the proletariat to 
extract from itself positive answers to the immense problems involved in the 
reconstruction of modern society. No one - no individual, group, or party - can 
be delegated this consciousness "on behalf of" the proletarian class or in its 
stead. It is not only that a substitution of this sort would inevitably lead to 
the formation of a new group of rulers and would rapidly return society to "all 
the old rubbish." It is because it is impossible for a particular group to take 
on such tasks, since these tasks are on a scale that humanity and humanity alone 
is capable of dealing with. Within a system of exploitation, such problems can 
be solved by a minority of leaders (or rather they could in the past be solved 
that way). The crisis of modern regimes shows that the direction of society is a 
task that is henceforth beyond the capacity of any particular category. This is 
infinitely more true for the problems that the socialist reconstruction of 
society will pose and that cannot be solved or even be correctly posed without 
the deployment of the creative activity of the immense majority of individuals. 
For the real meaning of this reconstruction is, strictly speaking, that 
everything must be re-examined and refashioned: machines, factories, articles of 
consumption, houses, educational systems, political institutions, museums, 
ideas, and science itself - according to the needs of the workers and according 
to their view of things. Only they can be the judges of what these needs are and 
of the means of satisfying them. For even if on a particular point the experts 
have a "better" idea, such an idea will be worthless so long as those it should 
interest do not see the correctness or necessity of it. Any attempt to impose 
upon people solutions to the problems of their own lives, solutions they do not 
themselves approve of, automatically and immediately makes these solutions 
monstrously false ones. </p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">The Development of the Proletariat toward Socialism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Is socialism, conceived in this way, a historically reasonable 
prospect? Is it a possibility that exists within modern society? Or is it just a 
dream? Is the proletariat just something to be exploited, a modern class of 
industrial slaves that periodically breaks out in fruitless revolts? Or do the 
conditions of its existence and struggle against capitalism lead it to develop a 
consciousness - i.e., an attitude, a mentality, ideas and ways of acting - whose 
content tends toward socialism?</p>

<p class="fst">The answers to these questions are to be found in the analysis of 
the real history of the proletariat, its life in production, its political 
movements, and its activity during periods of revolution. And this analysis in 
turn leads to the overthrow of traditional ideas about socialism, labour 
demands, and forms of organization.</p>

<p class="fst">First, the proletariat's struggle against capitalism is neither 
solely one of "making demands" nor solely "political"; it begins at the point of 
production. It does not simply concern the redistribution of the social product 
or, at the other end of the scale, the general organization of society. From the 
outset, it opposes the fundamental reality of capitalism, the relations of 
production within the enterprise. The so-called rationalization of capitalist 
production is nothing but a web of contradictions. It consists in organizing 
work without the involvement of the workers, abolishing their human role - which 
is inherently absurd even from the point of view of productive efficiency. It 
aims untiringly at increasing their exploitation - which forces them to oppose 
it nonstop.</p>

<p class="fst">Far from being concerned only with wages, the workers' struggle 
against this method of organization dominates every aspect and every moment of 
the life of the firm. First of all, the conflict between workers and management 
over wages cannot but have an immediate impact on every aspect of the 
organization of work.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> In the next place, the workers, whatever their wage 
level, are led inevitably to oppose methods of production that lead to their 
daily, ever more intolerable dehumanization. This struggle does not and cannot 
remain purely negative, its aim is not simply to limit exploitation. Production 
must take place whatever happens, and the workers, at the same time as they are 
struggling against the norms and the coercive bureaucratic apparatus, maintain a 
work discipline and instaurate a system of cooperation opposed in spirit as well 
as in practice to the rules of organization of the factory. They thus take over 
certain aspects of the management of production at the same time as they 
establish in what they do new principles for the ordering of human relations in 
production; they oppose the capitalist morality of maximum individual gain and 
tend to replace it with a new morality of solidarity and equality.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This struggle is not accidental, nor is it connected with a 
particular form of organization of capitalist production. Every time capitalism 
makes major changes in the techniques and methods of production in order to ward 
off this struggle, it rises up again. The workers' tendencies toward 
self-management that this struggle brings out is universal both in range and 
depth. It exists in Russia as well as in the United States and in England as 
well as in France. Although the proletariat's struggle inside production remains 
"hidden," for it allows neither formal organization nor a formulated program nor 
overt action, its content can be found in the activity of the masses each time a 
revolutionary crisis shakes capitalist society. In every factory in the world 
workers fight nonstop against work norms; the abolition of norms was one of the 
most important demands of the Hungarian workers' councils in 1956. Like the 
commune and the soviets, workers' councils were constituted on the principle 
that the elected delegates were liable to recall. Shop stewards in English 
factories are always liable to recall by the workers who elected them, and they 
must give these workers regular accounts of their activities.</p>

<p class="fst">The socialist conception of society, born in the obscurity of the 
day-to-day lives of producers, bursts into broad daylight during the 
working-class revolutions that have marked the history of capitalism. Far from 
rising up simply against poverty and exploitation, in the course of these events 
the proletariat poses the problem of how to organize the whole of society in a 
new way and provides positive answers. The Commune of 1871, the soviets of 1905 
and 1917, the factory committees in Russia in 1917-18, the factory councils in 
Germany in 1919-20, and the workers' councils in Hungary in 1956 were 
organizations formed to combat the ruling class and its state and at the same 
time new forms of human organization based on principles radically opposed to 
those of bourgeois society. These creations of the proletariat were a practical 
refutation of the ideas that have dominated man's political organization for 
centuries. They have shown the possibility of a centralized social organization 
that, instead of politically expropriating the population for the benefit of its 
"representatives," on the contrary places these representatives under the 
permanent control of their electors and for the first time in modern history 
achieves democracy on the scale of society as a whole. In the same way, workers' 
management of production, sought by the Russian factory committees in 1917, was 
achieved by the Spanish workers in 1936-37 and proclaimed by the Hungarian 
workers' councils in 1956 as one of their basic objectives.</p>

<p class="fst">But the development of the proletariat toward socialism shows 
itself not only in factory life or during revolutions. From the beginning of its 
history, the proletariat has struggled against capitalism in an explicit way, 
that is to say, by forming political organizations. The tendency of the working 
class or of broad strata of workers to organize themselves in order to struggle 
in an overt and permanent fashion is a theme running through the whole of modern 
history. If this is not recognized, one is doomed to understand as little about 
the proletariat and socialism as if the commune or the councils were never 
known. For it shows that the proletariat has the need and at the same time the 
ability to argue the question of social organization as such not simply during a 
revolutionary explosion, but systematically and permanently; to go beyond the 
territory of its economic defence and to oppose bourgeois ideology with its own 
conception of society; to leave the confines of the workshop, the firm, and even 
the nation and argue the question of power on an international scale. It is in 
fact entirely false to say that the working class has created only economic and 
occupational associations (trade unions). In certain countries, such as Germany, 
the workers began by building a political movement, and the trade unions 
emanated from this. In the majority of other cases, as in the Latin countries 
and even in England, the trade unions themselves originally were by no means 
purely trade unions; their proclaimed aim was the abolition of the wages system. 
It is just as false to claim that the workers' political organizations were the 
exclusive creation of intellectuals, as has been said, sometimes approvingly and 
sometimes disapprovingly. Even where intellectuals played a predominant role in 
their formation, these organizations could never have acquired any sort of 
reality if workers had not belonged to them in great numbers, sustained them 
with their experience, their activity, and often their blood, and if a large 
majority of the working class had not long seen their interests expressed in the 
programs of these organizations.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">The Contradictory Character of the Proletariat's Development</a></h3>

<p class="fst">There is, therefore, an autonomous development of the proletariat 
toward socialism that originates in the workers' struggle against the capitalist 
organization of production, finds expression in the formation of political 
organizations, and culminates in revolution. But this development is not the 
mechanical, automatic result of the objective conditions in which the 
proletariat lives, nor is it a biological evolution, an inevitable process of 
maturation that provides for its own development. It is a historical process and 
essentially a process of struggle. Workers are not born socialists, nor are they 
miraculously transformed into such merely by entering into a factory. They 
become, or more exactly they make themselves, socialists in the course of and 
out of their struggle against capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, we must see exactly what this struggle is, where it 
is fought, and what the true enemy is. The proletariat is not only fighting 
capitalism as a force outside itself. If it were just a question of the physical 
power of the exploiters, their State and their army, exploitative society would 
have been abolished long ago, for it possesses no power of its own beyond the 
work of those it exploits. It survives only insofar as it succeeds in making 
them accept their position. Its most formidable weapons are not those it uses 
intentionally, but those it is automatically provided with by the objective 
condition of the exploited class, by the way things are set up in present 
society, and by the way social relations are organized so as to perpetually 
recreate its own bases. The proletariat is not only systematically indoctrinated 
by the bourgeoisie and the bureaucracy. More generally, it is severely deprived 
of culture. It is robbed of its own past, since it can know only what the ruling 
classes decide to let it see of its history and its past struggles. It is robbed 
of awareness of itself as a universal class as a result of the local, 
occupational, and national factors of isolation engendered by the present social 
structure - and of its present condition, since all the information media are 
under the control of the ruling classes.</p>

<p class="fst">In spite of its position as an exploited class, the proletariat 
struggles against these factors and makes up for them. It develops a systematic 
distrust of bourgeois indoctrination and undertakes a critique of its contents. 
It tends to absorb the culture from which it is cut off in a thousand ways at 
the same time as it creates the beginnings of a new culture. From a book-learned 
point of view, it is unaware of its own past, but it finds before it its 
essential results in the form of the conditions for its present action.</p>

<p class="fst">But by far the greatest obstacle in the way of the development of 
the proletariat is the perpetual rebirth of the spirit and reality of capitalism 
within the proletariat itself. The workers are not strangers to capitalism; they 
are born into a capitalist society, live in it, take part in it, and make it 
work. Capitalist ideas, norms, and attitudes tend constantly to invade their 
minds and as long as the present society lasts it will not be any different. The 
situation of the proletariat is absolutely contradictory, for at the same time 
that it gives birth to the elements of a new human organization and of a new 
culture it can never free itself entirely from the capitalist society in which 
it lives. The strongest hold of society is found mainly in the fields that are 
given the least thought; they are the time-honoured habits, the "self-evident" 
axioms of bourgeois common sense that no one calls into question, inertia, and 
society's systematically organized inhibition of people's activity and 
creativity. During a revolution, capitalism may be defeated militarily and yet 
remain victorious if, in order to defeat it and under the pretext of 
"efficiency," the revolutionary army or the production process is organized 
along capitalist lines (as was the case in Russia in 1918-21), for this "moral" 
victory for the old society soon will manage to transform itself into complete 
victory. The workers may score the enormous victory of building a revolutionary 
organization that expresses their aspirations - and immediately turn victory 
into defeat if they think that once the organization is built it remains only 
for them to have confidence in it for it to solve their problems.</p>

<p class="fst">The proletariat's struggle against capitalism is, therefore, in 
its most important aspect, a struggle of the working class against itself, a 
struggle to free itself from what persists in it of the society it is combating. 
The history of the labour movement is the history of the development of the 
proletariat through this struggle, a development that has not been a continuous 
advance but an unequal and contradictory process of gaining and losing ground, 
containing entire periods of regression.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<h2><a name="h6">2. The Degeneration of Working-Class Organizations</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The evolution of workers' organizations can be understood only in 
this context. For a century the proletariat of all countries has been setting up 
organizations to help them in their struggle, and all these organizations, 
whether trade unions or political parties, ultimately have degenerated and 
become integrated into the system of exploitation. In this respect it matters 
little whether they have become purely and simply instruments of the State and 
of capitalist society (like the reformist organizations), or whether (like the 
Stalinist organizations) they aim to bring about a transformation of this 
society, concentrating economic and political power in the hands of a 
bureaucratic stratum while leaving unaltered the exploitation of the workers. 
The main point is that such organizations have become the strongest opponents of 
their original aim: the emancipation of the proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course this is not a question of "mistakes" or of "betrayals" 
on the part of leaders. Leaders who "err" or "betray" are sooner or later 
removed from the organizations they lead. But the degeneration of workers' 
organizations has gone hand in hand with their bureaucratization, i.e., with the 
formation within them of a stratum of irremovable and uncontrollable leaders. 
Thenceforth the policy of these organizations expresses the interests and 
aspirations of this bureaucracy.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> To understand the degeneration of these 
organizations is to understand how a bureaucracy can be born out of the labour 
movement.</p>

<p class="fst">Briefly, bureaucratization has meant that the fundamental social 
relationship of modern capitalism, the relationship between directors and 
executants, has reproduced itself within the labour movement, and in two forms: 
first, within the workers' organizations, which have responded to the 
enlargement and multiplication of their tasks by adopting a bourgeois model of 
organization, instaurating a greater and greater division of labour until a new 
stratum of leaders has crystallized, separate from the mass of militants who 
from then on are reduced to the role of executants; and second, between 
working-class organizations and the proletariat itself. The function these 
organizations have gradually taken on has been to lead the working class in its 
own, well-defined interest - and most of the time, the working class has agreed 
to rely on these organizations and carry out their instructions. And so we have 
arrived at a complete negation of what was the essence of a socialist movement, 
namely, the idea of the autonomy of the proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">This evolution has a counterpart in the corresponding evolution 
of revolutionary theory and ideology, made possible by the initially 
contradictory character of Marxism itself. In a sense, nothing of what has been 
said here about workers' management and the autonomy of the proletariat is new. 
It all goes back to Marx's formula, "The emancipation of the working class must 
be conquered by the workers themselves"; in other words, emancipation will take 
place only insofar as the workers themselves decide the means and the ends of 
their struggle. This intuition of autonomy is in keeping with the deepest and 
most positive aspects of Marx's work: the central importance he accorded to the 
analysis of the relations of production in the capitalist factory, the radical 
critique of bourgeois ideology in all its aspects and even of the traditional 
notion of "theory," and the vision of socialism as a new reality whose elements 
are beginning to appear in the lives and attitudes of the workers even now.</p>

<p class="fst">Yet Marxism, itself born in capitalist society, has not freed 
itself, and could not free itself completely from the culture in which it grew 
up. Its position - like the position of any revolutionary ideology and like the 
situation of the proletariat until the revolution - remains contradictory. "The 
ruling ideas of each epoch are the ideas of its ruling class" does not simply 
mean that those ideas are physically the most widespread or the most widely 
accepted. It also means they tend to be assented to, partially and 
unconsciously, by the very people who oppose them the most violently. In the 
theoretical sphere no less than in the practical sphere, the struggle of the 
revolutionary movement to free itself from the hold of capitalism is a permanent 
struggle. </p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h7">The Decline of Revolutionary Theory</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Very quickly the idea began to catch on that Marxism was the 
science of society and revolution. Attempts were made to present it as the 
synthesis and continuation of the creations of bourgeois culture (German 
classical philosophy, English political economy, and French utopian socialism), 
ignoring the fact that the prime feature in Marx's work was precisely his 
overthrow of the fundamental postulates of that culture. This quite naturally 
led to it being said, in consequence, that socialist political consciousness has 
to be introduced into the working class "from the outside," for "modern 
socialist consciousness can only arise upon a basis of deep scientific 
knowledge" and "the vehicle of science is not the proletariat but the petty 
bourgeois intelligentsia."<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Although these formulations of Kautsky's were taken up by Lenin, 
they are not in any way the exclusive attribute of bolshevism; they also express 
the typical attitude of the leaders of the Second International and of the 
reformists.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> But their spirit is found in Marx himself. The debasement of 
revolutionary theory is symbolized by the gap between the subtitle of Capital 
("a critique of political economy" - not "a critique of bourgeois political 
economy" but a critique of the very notion of political economy, of the very 
idea that there is a "science" of political economy) and what it became during 
the course of its elabouration: an attempt to establish the "laws of movement of 
the capitalist economy." In the hands of his epigones the idea was further 
transformed into a scientific proof that the downfall of capitalism and the 
victory of socialism were inevitable and "guaranteed by natural laws."<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> The 
Marxist theory now tries to reproduce the model of the natural sciences in 
relation to society - which comes down to saying that it borrows its logical 
structure from the bourgeois thought of its period, just as it borrows its 
method of exposition from bourgeois culture. Conceived in this way, it can only 
in fact be expounded by intellectual specialists, cut off from the proletariat. 
Even its basic premises, in the final analysis, reflect basically bourgeois 
ideas.</p>

<p class="fst">In the strict sense, the economic theory expounded in Capital is 
based on the postulate that capitalism has managed completely and effectively to 
transform the worker - who appears there only as labour power - into a 
commodity; therefore the use value of labour power - the use the capitalist 
makes of it - is, as for any commodity, completely determined by the user, since 
its exchange value - wages - is determined solely by the laws of the market and 
in the first place by the production costs of labour power. This postulate is 
necessary for there to be a "science of economics" along the lines of the 
physico-mathematical model Marx followed to an increasing degree during the 
course of the exposition of Capital. But he contradicts the most essential fact 
of capitalism, namely, that the use value and exchange value of labour power are 
objectively indeterminate; they are determined rather by the struggle between 
labour and capital both in production and in society. <i>Here</i> is the 
ultimate root of the "objective" contradictions of capitalism (see "On the 
Content of Socialism, III"). The attempt to make them variables whose behaviour 
is completely determined by objective laws leads, not as Marx and generations of 
Marxists after him thought, to the proof of an "inevitable" crisis of 
capitalism, but on the contrary, to the "proof" of the latter's permanence. 
There would be no kind of historically important crisis if the proletariat 
remained completely passive [se laissait faire a 100%], as Capital postulates. 
The paradox is that Marx, the "inventor" of class struggle, wrote a monumental 
work on phenomena determined by this struggle in which the struggle itself was 
entirely absent.</p>

<p class="fst">It is hardly necessary to point out the degree to which such a 
conception is in contradiction to the idea of a conscious socialist revolution 
carried out by the masses. The latter would then indeed only have the role of 
supplying a verification of what the theory had already deduced <i>a priori</i>.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Revolutionary politics tended in this vision to be transformed 
into a <i>technique</i>. Just as the engineer applies the science of the 
physicist under given conditions and with certain ends in view, so the 
revolutionary politician applies the conclusions of the "scientific" theory of 
revolution in given conditions. Stalin, characterizing Lenin as the "brilliant 
engineer on the locomotive of history," was only expressing this idea with the 
crushing banality of which he alone was capable. </p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h8">The Debasement of the Party Program and of the Function of the Party</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The technical aspects of traditional revolutionary theory 
gradually assume prime importance in the programs of political organizations. On 
the one hand, the objectives of the proletariat can and should be determined by 
the theory; the emancipation of the proletariat will be the work of the 
technicians of the revolution correctly applying their theory in given 
circumstances. On the other hand, what <i>this</i> theory allows theoreticians 
to grasp are solely the "objective" elements in the evolution of society, and 
socialism itself seems more and more bereft of all its human content and 
increasingly like a simple, "objective," external transformation; in its 
essentials, it comes to appear like a mere modification of certain economic 
arrangements out of which everything else would result as a by-product at some 
indeterminate future date. Exclusive preoccupation with the distribution of the 
social product as well as with the regulation of property and of the overall 
organization of the economy ("nationalization" and "planning") thus becomes 
inevitable, and the fact that socialism must mean above all a radical upheaval 
in the relationships between people, whether in production or in politics, is 
completely masked over.</p>

<p class="fst">And if socialism is a scientific truth to which specialists 
obtain access through their theoretical expositions, it follows that the 
function of the revolutionary party would be to bring socialism to the 
proletariat. The latter could not reach it through its own experience; at the 
very most it could recognize the party that incarnates this truth as the 
representative of the general interests of humanity and support it. There could 
be no question of its having any control over the party except through its 
passivity and refusal to follow it. Even then the party would have to conclude 
simply that it was unable to make its program concrete enough or its propaganda 
convincing enough - or that it was mistaken in its "appreciation of the 
situation"; but it could not learn much from the working class about anything 
basic. The party would possess the truth about socialism since it possesses the 
theory that alone leads to it. It is therefore the rightful leader of the 
proletariat, and it must become so in fact, since decision making can belong 
only to the specialists in the science of revolution. Insofar as it is permitted 
at all, democracy then is only an instructive procedure or an adjustment 
justified by the "imperfect" nature of revolutionary science. But only the party 
knows and can decide what the correct dose is. </p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h9">The Revolutionary Party Organized on a Capitalist Model</a></h3>

<p class="fst">This view, or more exactly this mentality, finds its counterpart 
within the organization in its mode of operation, in the type of work it carries 
out, and in the relationships that are instaurated inside it. The action of the 
organization will be correct if it conforms with the theory or at least with the 
art or technique of "politics," which has its specialists, too. Whatever the 
degree of formal democracy that exists within the organization, the militants 
will be aware that it is for the specialists to assess the objective situation 
and to deduce from it the line that must be followed; hence, all year long they 
will do nothing but carry out orders formulated by the political specialists. 
The dividing up of tasks, which is indispensable wherever there is a need for 
cooperation, becomes a real division of labour, the labour of giving orders 
being separate from that of carrying them out. Once instaurated, this division 
between directors and executants tends to broaden and deepen by itself. The 
leaders specialize in their role and become indispensable while those who carry 
out orders become absorbed in their concrete tasks. Deprived of information, of 
the general view of the situation, and of the problems of organization, arrested 
in their development by their lack of participation in the overall life of the 
Party, the organization's rank-and-file militants less and less have the means 
or the possibility of having any control over those at the top.</p>

<p class="fst">This division of labour is supposed to be limited by "democracy." 
But democracy, which should mean that <i>the majority rules</i> [<i>dirige</i>], 
is reduced to meaning that the majority <i>designates its rulers</i>; copied in 
this way from the model of bourgeois parliamentary democracy, drained of any 
real meaning, it quickly becomes a veil thrown over the unlimited power of the 
rulers. The base does not run the organization just because once a year it 
elects delegates who designate the central committee, no more than the people 
are sovereign in a parliamentary-type republic because they periodically elect 
deputies who designate the government.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us consider, for example, "democratic centralism" as it is 
supposed to function in an ideal Leninist party. That the central committee is 
designated by a "democratically elected" congress makes no difference since, 
once it is elected, it is de facto and de jure the absolute ruler of the 
organization. It is not only that it has complete (statutory) control over the 
body of the Party (and can dissolve the base organizations, kick out militants, 
etc.) or that, under such conditions, it can determine the composition of the 
next congress. The central committee could use its powers in an honourable way, 
these powers could be reduced; the members of the Party might enjoy "political 
rights" such as being able to express themselves in internal and even outside 
publications, to form factions, etc. Fundamentally, this would not change the 
situation, for the central committee would still remain the organ that defines 
the political line of the organization and controls its application from top to 
bottom, that, in a word, has a permanent monopoly on the job of leadership. The 
expression of opinions only has a limited value once the way the group functions 
prevents this opinion from forming on solid bases, i.e., permanent 
<i>participation</i> in the organization's activities and in the solution of 
problems that arise. If the way the organization is run makes the solution of 
general problems the specific task and permanent work of a separate category of 
militants, only their opinion will, or will appear, to count to the others. And 
this situation will carry further into the political tendencies that exist 
within the Party. Under such conditions, a congress meeting at regular intervals 
is no more "democratic" than parliamentary elections; indeed, both boil down in 
effect to inviting electors to voice their opinions from time to time on 
problems from which they are removed the rest of the time, while moreover taking 
away from them all means of having any control over what happens as a result.</p>

<p class="fst">This criticism applies not only to bolshevism, but also to 
social-democratic organizations and trade unions of all kinds. In this respect, 
the difference between a Stalinist and a reformist party is comparable to that 
between a totalitarian regime and a bourgeois "democratic" one. Formal 
individual rights may be greater in the second case but this makes no difference 
in the actual structure of power, which in both instances is the exclusive power 
of a particular category of people. </p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h10">The Objective Conditions for Bureaucratization</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The phenomenon of degeneration and bureaucratization that 
working-class organizations undergo is a total one, embracing every aspect of 
their existence. It is a process of debasement just as much in revolutionary 
theory as in the program, activities, function, and structure of these 
organizations, and the work that militants accomplish in them.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This does not mean that their actual historical evolution is the 
result of the debasement of ideas in the heads of individuals. This debasement 
is only the expression of the persistence of capitalism and capitalist ways of 
thinking and acting within the labour movement. It means that the movement has 
not managed to free itself from the hold of the society in which it was born, 
and that it is falling under its indirect influence again at the very moment it 
thinks it is putting up its most radical opposition to it.</p>

<p class="fst">That this hold had a basis in the totality of productive, 
economic, political, and ideological relationships of the established society 
and that in particular the bureaucratic evolution of the workers' organizations 
has been conditioned by the objective evolution of capitalism is certain. A 
reformist bureaucracy is inconceivable except in a developing capitalist economy 
that makes such reformism possible. A "revolutionary" or "totalitarian" 
bureaucracy such as the Stalinist bureaucracy is inconceivable except in a 
situation of permanent crisis in society that the traditional ruling classes are 
incapable of solving. More generally, a bureaucracy of any significant size in a 
workers' organization is inconceivable without a corresponding degree of 
concentration in the areas of production and statification of economic life. 
Both business enterprises and the labour force are concentrated, while the 
organizational form of huge trade unions easily prevents any initiative on the 
part of its members. And State intervention in economic and social life offers 
the bureaucracy an ideal terrain on which to carry out its activity, both with 
respect to economic grievances as well as on the political level.</p>

<p class="fst">This type of analysis is indispensable but incomplete and 
unsatisfactory. It would be false to present the bureaucratization of workers' 
organizations simply as a <i>result</i> of the evolution of capitalism toward 
concentration and statification. Very early on, the action of the proletariat or 
of "its" organizations played a determining role in the evolution of modern 
society so that after a certain point "cause" and "effect" can no longer be 
distinguished. Bureaucratic organizations have transformed their social 
environment so as to adapt it to their conditions of existence, and they 
continue to do so. Everything an analysis of this sort teaches us shows us that 
the objective situation makes bureaucratic degeneration possible (which we knew 
already), but it does not teach us that it makes it inevitable. And as far as 
revolutionary action in the future is concerned, it is of little use. It would 
be vain, for example, to claim to foresee a future evolution of events or 
conditions that would render bureaucratization "objectively impossible."<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is certain that capitalist society will always leave the 
possibility open for a leading section of the exploited classes to become 
integrated into the system of exploitation. It is also certain that the 
tendencies favouring the birth and growth of bureaucracy in workers' 
organizations are the prevailing tendencies of modern capitalism, which is 
becoming more and more a bureaucratic capitalism every day. Objective analysis 
is of the first importance, for it shows that bureaucratization, by no means an 
accidental or passing phenomenon, is a factor with which the revolutionary 
movement will always have to reckon. But it does not suffice to explain this 
phenomenon or guide our action.</p>

<p class="fst">This can be seen better by looking at a particularly important 
example. One's tendency is to present the bureaucratization of working-class 
organizations as the <i>inevitable</i> result of their numerical expansion: 
trade unions or parties numbering hundreds of thousands of members cannot, it is 
thought, organize, coordinate, and centralize their activities except by setting 
up organs specifically charged with these tasks, and hence by making leadership 
into a separate job entrusted to individuals who devote themselves to it 
professionally.</p>

<p class="fst">The sterility of such considerations is immediately noticeable; 
if things were so, the construction of a non-bureaucratic workers' organization, 
however large, would be impossible - and that of a socialist society too, 
probably. For its reasoning boils down to the assertion that the <i>problem</i> 
of centralization can be solved only by bureaucracy. But we see right away that 
this "objective" analysis is in no way objective, for before the start it has 
already adopted the most deeply rooted of bourgeois prejudices. What is 
objective is the problem of centralization that arises inevitably in the modern 
world. To this problem there are two solutions - and here objectivity ends. 
According to the bourgeois-bureaucratic solution, centralization is the 
particular responsibility of a particular stratum of leaders. This is the 
response workers' organizations have in the end subscribed to, and it is the one 
the argument set forth earlier implicitly accepts. But in the course of its 
struggles the working class has solved the problem of centralization in a 
completely different fashion. A general meeting of strikers, an elected strike 
committee, the commune, the soviet, the factory council - that's centralization. 
The proletarian response to the problem of centralization is direct democracy 
and the election of recallable delegates. And no one can prove that it would 
have been impossible for workers' organizations to solve the problem of 
centralization with the inspiration of this response rather than the bourgeois 
response.</p>

<p class="fst">In fact, the proletariat has on a number of occasions tried to 
organize itself in its own way, even in "normal" times. The first English trade 
unions practiced what Lenin called primitive democracy, contemptuously in 
<i>What Is to Be Done?</i> and admiringly in State and Revolution. These attempts 
could only disappear sooner or later. The vanguard, which played a prime role in 
the formation of these organizations, did not see organization in this way; all 
the same it could never have carried its point of view if the working class 
itself had not accepted it. And this allows us to see another essential aspect 
of all these problems.</p>

<p class="fst">The Role of the Proletariat in the Degeneration of Working-Class 
Organizations</p>

<p class="fst">Degeneration means that the working-class organization tends to 
become separate from the working class and an organ apart, its de facto and de 
jure leadership. But this does not come about because of defects in the 
structure of these organizations or their mistaken ideas or some sort of an evil 
spell cast on organization as such. These negative features reflect the failure 
of these organizations, which in turn is only an aspect of the failure of the 
proletariat itself. When a director/executant relationship is set up between the 
trade union or party and the proletariat, it means that the proletariat is 
allowing a relationship of the capitalist type to be instaurated within itself.</p>

<p class="fst">Hence degeneration is not a phenomenon peculiar to working-class 
organizations. It is just one of the expressions of the way capitalism survives 
within the proletariat; capitalism expresses itself not in the corruption of 
leaders by money, but as an ideology, as a type of social structure and as a set 
of relations between people. It is a manifestation of the immaturity of the 
proletariat vis-à-vis socialism. It corresponds to a phase in the labour 
movement and, even more generally, to a constant tendency toward integration 
into the system of exploitation or toward aiming for power for its own sake, 
which is expressed in the proletariat in symmetrical fashion as a tendency 
toward relying, consciously or passively, on the organization for a solution to 
its problems.</p>

<p class="fst">In the same way, the Party's claim that in possessing theory it 
possesses the truth and thereby should take the lead in everything would not 
have any real appeal if it did not make use of the conviction shared by the 
proletariat - and daily reproduced by life under capitalism - that general 
questions are the department of specialists and that its own experience of 
production and society is "unimportant." These two tendencies express one and 
the same sense of frustration and failure; they originate in the same facts and 
the same ideas and are impossible and inconceivable one without the other. Of 
course, we should judge differently the politician who wants to impose his point 
of view by all possible means and the worker who is totally incapable of finding 
a reply to his flow of words or of matching his cunning, and even more 
differently the leader who "betrays" and the worker who is "betrayed"; but we 
must not forget that the notion of treason has no meaning in such relationships. 
No one can indefinitely betray people who do not want to be betrayed and who do 
what is necessary to prevent their being betrayed any longer. Understanding this 
allows us to appreciate what all this proletarian fetishism and all these 
anti-organizational obsessions that recently have taken hold of certain people 
are really all about. When trade-union leaders carry through reformist policies, 
they only succeed because of the apathy, the acquiescence, and the insufficient 
response of the working masses. When, for four years, the French proletariat 
allows the Algerians to be massacred and tortured and only feebly stirs when the 
question of its being mobilized or of its wages becomes involved, it is very 
superficial to say that it is all a crime of Mollet's or of Thorez's<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> or of 
organizational bureaucratization in general.</p>

<p class="fst">The enormous role played by organizations themselves in this 
question does not mean that the working class plays no part at all. The working 
class is neither a totally irresponsible entity nor the absolute subject of 
history; and those who only see in the class's evolution the problem of the 
degeneration of its organizations paradoxically want to make it both at once. To 
hear them tell it, the proletariat draws everything from itself - and plays no 
part in the degeneration of workers' organizations. No, as a first approximation 
we should say that the proletariat only gets the organizations it is capable of 
having.</p>

<p class="fst">The situation of the proletariat forces it always to undertake 
and continuously recommence its struggle against capitalist society. In the 
course of this struggle it produces new contents and new forms - socialist 
contents and forms, for to fight capitalism means to put forward objectives, 
principles, standards, and forms of organization radically opposed to 
established society. But as long as capitalism endures, the proletariat will 
remain partly under its hold.</p>

<p class="fst">The effect of this hold can be seen particularly clearly in 
workers' organizations. When capitalism takes hold of them, these organizations 
degenerate - which goes hand in hand with their bureaucratization. As long as 
capitalism lasts, there will always be "objective conditions" making this 
degeneration possible. But this does not mean that bureaucratization is fated. 
People make their own history. Objective conditions simply allow a result that 
is the product of man's actions and attitudes to happen. When they have 
occurred, these actions have taken a very well defined path. On the one hand, 
revolutionary militants have partly remained or have returned to being prisoners 
of capitalist social relationships and ideology. On the other, the proletariat 
has remained just as much under this hold and has agreed to act as the executant 
of its organizations.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="h11">3. A New Period Begins for the Labor Movement</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Under what conditions can this situation change in the future? 
First, the experience of the preceding period will have to allow revolutionary 
militants and workers alike to become aware of the contradictory and, basically, 
reactionary elements in their own and the other's conceptions and attitudes. 
Militants will have to overthrow these traditional ideas and come around to 
viewing revolutionary theory, program, politics, activity, and organization in a 
new way, in a socialist way. On the other hand, the proletariat will have to 
come around to seeing its struggle as an autonomous struggle and the 
revolutionary organization not as a leadership responsible for its fate but as 
one moment and one instrument in its struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">Do these conditions exist now? Is this overthrow of traditional 
ideas an effort of will, an inspiration, or a new, more correct theory? No, this 
overthrow is made possible from now on by one great <i>objective</i> fact, 
specifically, the bureaucratization of the labour movement. The action of the 
proletariat has produced a bureaucracy. This bureaucracy has become integrated 
into the system of exploitation. If the proletariat's struggle against the 
bureaucracy continues, it will be turned not only against bureaucrats as persons 
but against bureaucracy as a system, as a type of social relationship, as a 
reality and an ideology corresponding to this reality.</p>

<p class="fst">This is an essential corollary to what was said earlier about the 
role of objective factors. There are no economic or other laws making 
bureaucratization henceforth impossible, but there is a development that has 
become objective, for society has become bureaucratized and so the proletariat's 
struggle against this society can only be a struggle against bureaucracy. The 
destruction of bureaucracy is not "predestined," just as the victory of the 
proletariat in its struggle is not "predestined" either. But the conditions for 
this victory are from now on satisfied by social reality, for awareness of the 
problems of bureaucracy no longer depends upon any theoretical arguments or upon 
any exceptional amount of lucidity; it can result from the daily experience of 
workers who encounter bureaucracy not as a potential threat in the distant 
future but as an enemy of flesh and bone, born of their very own activity.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h12">Proletariat and Bureaucracy in the Present Period</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The events of recent years show that the proletariat is gaining 
experience of bureaucratic organizations not as leadership groups that are 
"mistaken" or that "betray," but in an infinitely more profound way.</p>

<p class="fst">Where these organizations are in power, as in Eastern Europe, the 
proletariat sees them of necessity as purely and simply the incarnation of the 
system of exploitation. When it manages to break the totalitarian yoke, its 
revolutionary struggle is not just directed <i>against</i> bureaucracy; it puts 
forward aims that express in positive terms the experience of bureaucratization. 
In 1953 the workers of East Berlin asked for a "metalworkers' government" and 
later the Hungarian workers' councils demanded workers' management of 
production.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the majority of Western countries, the workers' attitude 
toward bureaucratic organizations shows that they see them as foreign and alien 
institutions. In contrast to what was still happening at the end of the Second 
World War, in no industrialized country do workers still believe that "their" 
parties or trade unions are willing or able to bring about a fundamental change 
in their situation. They may "support" them by voting for them as a lesser evil; 
they may use them - this is often still the case as far as trade unions are 
concerned - as one uses a lawyer or the fire brigade. But rarely do they 
<i>mobilize</i> themselves for them or at their call, and never do they actively 
participate in them. Membership in trade unions may rise or fall, no one attends 
trade-union meetings. Parties can rely less and less on the active militancy of 
workers who are party members; they now function mainly through paid permanent 
staff made up of "left-wing" members of the petty bourgeoisie and intellectuals. 
In the eyes of the workers, these parties and trade unions are part of the 
established order - more or less rotten than the rest - but basically the same 
as them. When workers' struggles erupt they often do so outside the bureaucratic 
organizations and sometimes directly <i>against</i> them.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">We therefore have entered a new phase in the development of the 
proletariat that can be dated, if you like, from 1953; this is the beginning of 
a historical period during which the proletariat will try to rid itself of the 
remnants of its creations of 1890 and 1917. Henceforth, when the workers put 
forward their own aims and seriously struggle to achieve them, they will be able 
to do so only outside, and most often in conflict with, bureaucratic 
organizations. This does not mean that the latter will disappear. For as long as 
the proletariat accepts the system of exploitation, organizations expressing 
this state of affairs will exist and will continue to serve as instruments for 
the integration of the proletariat into capitalist society. Without them, 
capitalist society can no longer possibly function. But because of this very 
fact, each struggle will tend to set the workers against these bureaucratized 
organizations; and if these struggles develop, new organizations will rise up 
from the proletariat itself, for sections of wage labourers, salaried workers, 
and intellectuals will feel the need to act in a systematic and permanent 
fashion to help the proletariat to achieve its new objectives.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h13">The Need for a New Organization</a></h3>

<p class="fst">If the working class is to enter a new phase of activity and 
development, immense practical and ideological needs will arise.</p>

<p class="fst">The proletariat will need organs that will allow it to express 
its experiences and opinions beyond the workshop and the office where the 
capitalist structure of society at present confines them and that will enable it 
to smash the bourgeois and bureaucratic monopoly over the means of expression. 
It will need information centers to tell it about what is happening among 
various groups of workers, within the ruling classes, in society in general, and 
in other countries. It will need organs for ideological struggle against 
capitalism and the bureaucracy capable of drawing out a positive socialist 
conception of the problems of society. It will feel the need for a socialist 
perspective to be defined, for the problems faced by a working class in power to 
be brought out and worked out, and for the experience of past revolutions to be 
drawn out and put at the disposal of present generations. It will need material 
means and instruments to carry out these tasks as well as interoccupational, 
interregional, and international liaisons to bring people and ideas together. It 
will need to attract office workers, technicians, and intellectuals into its 
camp and to integrate them into its struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">The working class cannot directly satisfy these needs itself 
except in a period of revolution. The working class can bring about a revolution 
"spontaneously," make the most far-reaching demands, invent forms of struggle of 
incomparable effectiveness, and create organs to express its power. But the 
working class as such, in a totally undifferentiated state, will not, for 
example, produce a national workers' newspaper, the absence of which is sorely 
felt today; it will be workers and militants who will produce it, and who will 
of necessity organize to produce it. It will not be the working class as a whole 
that spreads the news of a particular struggle fought in a particular place; if 
organized workers and militants don't do it, then this example will be lost, for 
it will remain unknown. In periods of normalcy, the working class as such will 
not absorb within itself the technicians and intellectuals whom capitalist 
society tends to separate from the workers all their lives; and without this 
sort of integration a host of problems facing the revolutionary movement in a 
modern society will remain insoluble. Neither will the working class as such nor 
intellectuals as such solve the problem of how to carry on a continuous 
elabouration of revolutionary theory and ideology, for such a resolution can 
only come about through a fusion of the experience of workers and the positive 
elements of modern culture. Now, the only place in contemporary society in which 
this fusion can take place is a revolutionary organization.</p>

<p class="fst">To work toward satisfying these needs therefore necessarily 
implies building an organization as large, as strong, and as effective as 
possible. We believe this organization can exist only under two conditions.</p>

<p class="fst">The first condition is that the working class recognize it as an 
indispensable tool in its struggle. Without substantial support from the working 
class the organization could not develop for better or for worse. The phobia 
about bureaucratization certain people are developing at the moment fails to 
recognize a basic fact: There is very little room for a new bureaucracy, 
objectively (the existing bureaucracies satisfy the needs of the system of 
exploitation) as well as, and above all, in the consciousness of the 
proletariat. Or else, if the proletariat again allowed a bureaucratic 
organization to develop and once more fell under its hold, the conclusion would 
have to be that all the ideas on which we base ourselves are false, at any rate 
as far as the present historical period and probably as far as socialist 
prospects are concerned. For this would mean that the proletariat was incapable 
of establishing a socialist relationship with a political organization, that it 
cannot solve the problem of its relations with the sphere of ideology, with 
intellectuals, and with other social groups on a healthy and fruitful basis, and 
therefore, ultimately, that it would find the problem of the "State" an 
insoluble one.</p>

<p class="fst">But such an organization will only be recognized by the 
proletariat as an indispensable tool in its struggle if - and this is the second 
condition - it learns all the lessons of the previous historical period and if 
it puts itself at the level of the proletariat's present experience and needs. 
Such an organization will be able to develop and indeed exist only if its 
activity, structure, ideas, and methods correspond to the anti-bureaucratic 
consciousness of the workers and express it and only if it is able to define 
revolutionary politics, theory, action, and work on new bases.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h14">Revolutionary Politics</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The end, and at the same time the means, of revolutionary 
politics is to contribute to the development of the consciousness of the 
proletariat in every sphere and especially where the obstacles to this 
development are greatest: with respect to the problem of society taken as a 
whole. But awareness is not recording and playing back, learning ideas brought 
in from the outside, or contemplating ready-made truths. It is activity, 
creation, the capacity to produce. It is therefore not a matter of "raising 
consciousness" through lessons, no matter how high the quality of the contents 
or of the teacher; it is rather to contribute to the development of the 
consciousness of the proletariat as a creative faculty.</p>

<p class="fst">Not only then is it not a question of revolutionary politics 
imposing itself on the proletariat or of manipulating it, but also it cannot be 
a question of preaching to the proletariat or of teaching it a "correct theory." 
The task of revolutionary politics is to contribute to the formation of the 
consciousness of the proletariat by contributing those elements of which it is 
dispossessed. But the proletariat can come to exert control over these elements, 
and, what is more important, it can effectively integrate them into its own 
experience and therefore make something out of them, only if they are 
organically connected with it. This is completely the opposite of 
"simplification" or popularization, and implies rather a continual deepening of 
the questions asked. Revolutionary politics must constantly show how society's 
most general problems are contained in the daily life and activity of the 
workers, and inversely, how the conflicts tearing apart their lives are, in the 
last analysis, of the same nature as those that divide society. It must show the 
connection between the solutions the workers offer to problems they face at work 
and those that are applicable to society as a whole. In short, it must extract 
the socialist content in what is constantly being created by the proletariat 
(whether it is a matter of a strike or of a revolution), formulate it 
coherently, propagate it, and show its universal import.</p>

<p class="fst">This is not to suggest that revolutionary politics is anything 
like a passive expression or reflection of working-class consciousness. This 
consciousness contains something of everything, both socialist elements and 
capitalist ones as we have shown at great length. There is Budapest and there 
are also large numbers of French workers who treat Algerians like 
bougnoules;<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> there are strikes against hierarchy and there are interunion 
jurisdictional disputes. Revolutionary politics can and must combat capitalism's 
continuous penetration into the proletariat, for revolutionary politics is 
merely one aspect of the struggle of the working class against itself. It 
necessarily implies making a choice among the things the working class produces, 
asks for, and accepts. The basis for this choice is revolutionary ideology and 
theory. </p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h15">Revolutionary Theory</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The long-prevalent conception of revolutionary theory - the 
science of society and revolution, as elabourated by specialists and introduced 
into the proletariat by the party - is in direct contradiction to the very idea 
of a socialist revolution being the autonomous activity of the masses. But it is 
just as erroneous on the theoretical plane. There is no "proof" of the 
inevitable collapse of the system of exploitation.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> There is even less 
"truth" in the possibility of socialism being established by a theoretical 
elabouration operating outside the concrete content created by the historic, 
everyday activity of the proletariat. The proletariat develops on its own toward 
socialism - otherwise there would be no prospect for socialism. The objective 
conditions for this development are given by capitalist society itself. But 
these conditions only establish the context and define the problems the 
proletariat will encounter in its struggle; they are a long way from determining 
the content of its answers to these problems. Its responses are a creation of 
the proletariat, for this class takes up the objective elements of the situation 
and at the same time transforms them, thereby opening up a previously unknown 
and unsuspected field of action and objective possibilities. The content of 
socialism is precisely this creative activity on the part of the masses that no 
theory ever could or ever will be able to anticipate. Marx could not have 
anticipated the commune (not as an event but as a form of social organization) 
nor Lenin the soviets, nor could either of them have anticipated worker's 
management. Marx could only draw conclusions from and recognize the significance 
of the action of the Parisian proletariat during the Commune - and he merits the 
great distinction of having shattered his own previously held views to do so. 
But it would be just as false to say that once these conclusions have been 
reached, the theory possesses the truth and can rigidify it in formulations that 
will remain valid indefinitely. These formulations will be valid only until the 
next phase of activity by the masses, for each time they again enter into action 
the masses tend to go beyond their previous level of action, and thereby beyond 
the conclusions of previous theoretical elabourations.</p>

<p class="fst">Socialism is not a correct theory as opposed to false theories; 
it is the possibility of a new world rising out of the depths of society that 
will bring into question the very notion of "theory." Socialism is not a correct 
idea. It is a project for the transformation of history. Its content is that 
those who half the time are the objects of history will become wholly its 
subjects - which would be inconceivable if the meaning of this transformation 
were possessed by a particular group of individuals.</p>

<p class="fst">Consequently, the conception of revolutionary theory must be 
changed. It must be modified, in the first place, with respect to the ultimate 
source for its ideas and principles - which can be nothing else but the historic 
as well as day-to-day experience and action of the proletariat. All of economic 
theory has to be reconstructed around what is contained in embryo in the 
tendency of workers toward equality in pay; the entire theory of production 
around the informal organization of workers in the factory; all of political 
theory around the principles embodied in the soviets and the councils. It is 
only with the help of these landmarks that theory can illuminate and make use of 
what is of revolutionary value among the general cultural creations of 
contemporary society.</p>

<p class="fst">The conception of theory must be modified, in the second place, 
with respect to both its objective and function. This cannot be to churn out the 
eternal truths of socialism, but to assist in the struggle for the liberation of 
the proletariat and humanity. This does not mean that theory is a utilitarian 
appendage of revolutionary struggle or that its value is to be measured by the 
degree of effectiveness of propaganda. Revolutionary theory is itself an 
essential moment in the struggle for socialism and is such to the degree that it 
contains the truth. Not speculative or contemplative truth, but truth bound up 
with practice, truth that casts light upon a project for the transformation of 
the world. Its function, then, is to state explicitly, and on every occasion, 
the meaning of the revolutionary venture and of the workers' struggle; to shed 
light on the context in which this action is set, to situate the various 
elements in it and to provide an overall explanatory schema for understanding 
these elements and for relating them to each other; and to maintain the vital 
link between the past and the future of the movement. But above all, it is to 
elabourate the prospects for socialism. For revolutionary theory, the ultimate 
guarantor for the critique of capitalism and for the prospect of a new society 
is to be found in the activity of the proletariat, its opposition to established 
forms of social organization and its tendency to instaurate new relationships 
between people. But theory can and must bring out the truths that spring from 
this activity by showing their universal validity. It must show that the 
proletariat's challenge to capitalist society expresses the deepest 
contradiction within that society; it must show the objective possibility of a 
socialist society. It therefore must define the socialist outlook as completely 
as possible at any given moment according to the experience and activity of the 
proletariat - and in return interpret this experience according to this outlook.</p>

<p class="fst">Indeed, the conception of theory must be modified with respect to 
the way it is elabourated. As an expression of what is universally valid in the 
experience of the proletariat and as a fusion of that experience with the 
revolutionary elements in contemporary culture, revolutionary theory cannot be 
elabourated, as was done in the past, by a particular stratum of intellectuals. 
It will have no value, no consistency with what it elsewhere proclaims to be its 
essential principles unless it is constantly being replenished, in practice, by 
the experience of the workers as it takes shape in their day-to-day lives. This 
implies a radical break with the practice of traditional organizations. The 
intellectuals' monopoly over theory is not broken by the fact that a tiny group 
of workers are "educated" by the organization - and thus transformed into 
second-string intellectuals; on the contrary, this simply perpetuates the 
problem. The task the organization is up against in this sphere is to merge 
intellectuals with workers as workers as it is elabourating its views. This 
means that the questions asked, and the methods for discussing and working out 
these problems, must be changed so that it will be possible for the worker to 
take part. This is not a case of "the teacher making allowances," but rather the 
primary condition to be fulfilled if revolutionary theory is to remain adequate 
to its principles, its object, and its content. There obviously cannot be equal 
participation on all subjects; the important thing is that there be equal 
participation on the basic ones. Now, for revolutionaries, the first change to 
bring about concerns the question of what is a basic subject. It is clear that 
workers could not participate as workers and on the basis of their experience in 
a discussion on the falling rate of profit. It so happens, as if by accident, 
that this problem is, strictly speaking, unimportant (even scientifically). More 
generally, nonparticipation in traditional organizations has gone along with a 
conception of revolutionary theory as a "science" that has no connection with 
people's experiences except in its most remote consequences. What we are saying 
here leads us to adopt a diametrically opposed position; by definition, nothing 
can be of basic concern to revolutionary theory if there is no way of linking it 
up organically with the workers' own experience. It is also obvious that this 
connection is not always simple and direct and that the experience involved here 
is not experience reduced to pure immediacy. The mystification that there is 
some kind of "spontaneous process" through which the worker can, through an 
effortless and magic operation, find everything he needs to make a socialist 
revolution in the here and now of his own experience is the exact counterpart to 
the bureaucratic mystification it is trying to combat, and it is just as 
dangerous.</p>

<p class="fst">These considerations show that it is vain to talk of 
revolutionary theory outside a revolutionary organization. Only an organization 
formed as a revolutionary workers' organization, in which workers numerically 
predominate and dominate it on fundamental questions, and which creates broad 
avenues of exchange with the proletariat, thus allowing it to draw upon the 
widest possible experience of contemporary society - only an organization of 
this kind can produce a theory that will be anything other than the isolated 
work of specialists. </p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h16">Revolutionary Action</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The task of the organization is not just to arrive at a 
conception - the clearest possible - of the revolutionary struggle and then keep 
it to itself. This conception has no meaning unless it is a moment in this 
struggle; it has no value unless it can aid in the workers' struggle and assist 
in the formation of their experience. These two aspects are inseparable. Unlike 
the intellectual, whose experiences are formed by reading, writing, and 
speculative thinking, workers can form their experiences only through their 
actions. The organization therefore can contribute to the formation of workers' 
experience only if (a) it acts in an exemplary fashion, and (b) it helps the 
workers to act in an effective and fruitful way.</p>

<p class="fst">Unless it wants to renounce its existence completely, the 
organization cannot renounce acting, nor can it give up trying to influence 
actions and events in a particular direction. No form of action considered in 
itself can be ruled out in advance. These forms of action can only be judged by 
their effectiveness in achieving the aim of the organization - which continues 
to be the lasting development of the consciousness of the proletariat. These 
forms range from the publication of journals and pamphlets to the issuing of 
leaflets calling for such and such an action and the promulgation of slogans 
that in a given historic situation can allow a rapid crystallization of the 
awareness of the proletariat's own aims and will to act. The organization can 
carry through this action coherently and consciously only if it has a point of 
view on the immediate as well as the historical problems confronting the working 
class and only if it defends this point of view before the working class - in 
other words, only if it acts according to a <i>program</i> that condenses and 
expresses the experience of the labour movement up to that point.</p>

<p class="fst">Three tasks facing the organization at present are highly urgent 
and require a more precise definition.</p>

<p class="fst">The first is to bring to expression the experience of the workers 
and to help them become aware of the awareness they already possess. Two 
enormous obstacles prevent workers from expressing themselves. The first is the 
material impossibility of expressing themselves as a result of the monopoly over 
the means of expression exercised by the bourgeoisie, the parties of the "Left," 
and the trade unions. The revolutionary organization will have to put its organs 
at the disposal of workers, whether organized or not. But there is a second, 
even more formidable obstacle: Even when they are given the material means to 
express themselves, the workers do not do so. At the root of this attitude is 
found the idea constantly spawned [créée] by bourgeois society and encouraged by 
"working-class" organizations that what workers have to say does not really 
matter. The conviction that the "great" problems of society are unrelated to 
working-class experience, and that they belong to the field of specialists and 
leaders, is constantly taking root in the proletariat; in the last analysis, 
this conviction is the essential condition for the survival of the system of 
exploitation. It is the duty of the revolutionary organization to combat this, 
first, by its critique of present society, showing in particular the bankruptcy 
of this system and the inability of its leaders to solve their problems; and 
then and above all, by showing the positive importance of the workers' 
experience and the answer this contains in embryo to the most general problems 
of society. It is only insofar as the idea is destroyed that what the workers 
have to say is insignificant, that workers will express themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">The second task of the organization is to place before the 
proletariat an overall conception of the problems of present-day society and, in 
particular, the problem of socialism. Workers find it hard to envision the 
possibility of workers' management of society and see rather the degradation the 
idea of socialism has suffered through its bureaucratic caricatures. Taken 
together, these difficulties constitute the main obstacles in the way of 
revolutionary action on the part of the proletariat in this period of deep 
crisis in the social relationships of capitalism. It is for the organization to 
rearouse in the proletariat this <i>awareness of the possibility of socialism</i>; 
without it, revolutionary development will be infinitely more difficult.</p>

<p class="fst">The organization's third task is to help the workers defend their 
immediate interests and position. As a result of the complete bureaucratization 
of trade unions in the great majority of cases and the inanity of any move aimed 
at replacing them by new and "improved" trade unions, today the revolutionary 
organization alone can take on an entire series of functions essential for the 
success and even the lodging of economic demands. These include the functions of 
inquiry, communication, and liaison; the basic material functions that go along 
with them; and finally, and especially, the functions involved in the systematic 
clarification and circulation of <i>exemplary</i> demands, organizational forms, 
and methods of conducting struggles that have been created by one or another 
category of workers. This action by the organization in no way denies the 
importance that autonomous, minority factions of militant workers in various 
companies might take on in the coming period. The action of such groupings 
cannot in the end be successful unless they manage to go beyond the narrow 
framework of the firm and expand onto the interoccupational and national levels; 
moreover, the organization can make a decisive contribution to the extension of 
their role. But what is most important, experience shows that such groupings 
will only remain passing phenomena unless they are animated by militants who are 
convinced of the necessity for permanent action and who, as a result of this 
conviction, link this action with problems that go beyond the situation of 
workers in their firm. These militants will find the organization an 
indispensable support for their action, and most often they will originate from 
this organization. In other words, the formation of minority factions within 
firms will most of the time be achieved as a result of the activity of the 
revolutionary organization. </p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h17">The Structure of the Organization</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In this sphere too, the organization's inspiration can come only 
from the socialist structures created by the working class in the course of its 
history. It must let itself be guided by the principles on which the soviet and 
the factory council were founded, not copying such organizations literally, but 
adapting them to suit the conditions in which it is placed. This means:</p>

<p class="fst">1. That in deciding their own activities, grass-roots organs 
enjoy as much autonomy as is compatible with the general unity of action of the 
organization;</p>

<p class="fst">2. That direct democracy, i.e., collective decision making by all 
those involved, be applied wherever it is materially possible; and</p>

<p class="fst">3. That the central organs empowered to make decisions be 
composed of delegates elected from the grass-roots organs who are liable to 
recall at any time.</p>

<p class="fst">In other words, the principles of workers' management must govern 
the operation and structure of the organization. Apart from them, there are only 
capitalist principles, which, as we have seen, can only result in the 
establishment of capitalist relationships.</p>

<p class="fst">In particular, it is the problem of the relationship between 
centralization and decentralization that the organization must resolve on the 
basis of the principles of workers' management. The organization is a collective 
unit, in action and even in production; it therefore cannot exist without unity 
of action, and consequently all questions relating to the organization as a 
whole necessarily involve centralized decision making. "Centralized" does not 
mean that decisions are to be made by a central committee; on the contrary, they 
are to be made by the organization as a whole, either directly or through 
elected, recallable delegates, using the principle of majority vote. 
Furthermore, it is essential that within the framework of these central 
decisions, the grass-roots organs govern their own activities autonomously.</p>

<p class="fst">The confusion created by bureaucratic domination over the past 
thirty years has turned some people today against centralization as such 
(whether in a revolutionary organization or in a socialist society) and has led 
them to contrast it with democracy. Such an opposition is absurd. Feudalism was 
decentralized, and if Khrushchev's Russia became decentralized it would not make 
it any more democratic. On the other hand, a factory council is centralization 
itself. Democracy is only a form of centralization; it means simply that the 
<i>center</i> is the <i>totality</i> of those who take part and that decisions are 
made by a majority of these participants and not by any authority apart from 
them. Bolshevik "democratic centralism" was not <i>democratic</i> centralism, as 
we saw earlier. In reality, it works by assigning decision-making functions to a 
minority of leaders. The proletariat has always been centralist. This is as true 
of its historical actions (the commune, soviets, workers' councils) as of its 
current struggles. Likewise, it has been democratic, that is to say, a supporter 
of the rule of the majority. If the social origin of opposition to the majority 
principle is to be sought, it certainly will not be found in the working class.</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, the problem of democracy in the organization 
concerns not only the form in which decisions are made but the entire process by 
which these decisions are arrived at. Democracy is meaningful only if those who 
are to make the decisions are able to do so in full knowledge of the relevant 
facts.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> The problem of democracy, therefore, also embraces the problem of 
obtaining adequate information; but it does not involve only this, for it also 
includes the nature of the questions posed and the attitude of the participants 
toward these questions and toward the results of this or that decision. Finally, 
democracy is impossible without the active and permanent <i>participation</i> of 
all the members of the organization in its work and in its operation. Again, 
this participation does not and cannot result from the psychological 
peculiarities of militants, such as their force of character or their 
enthusiasm. It depends above all on the type of work the organization proposes 
to them and on the way in which this work is conceived and carried out. If the 
work they do reduces them to the role of executants of decisions actually made 
by others, their participation will be infinitesimal. Even if these decisions 
are implemented with great devotion, the degree of participation necessarily 
will be only a small fraction of what it is potentially. It is therefore the 
degree of opportunity afforded by the organization to each of its members to 
participate in the output of the organization as a creative member of the group 
and to use his own experience to exert control over this output that will allow 
one to measure the degree of democracy the organization has been able to attain.</p>

<p class="fst">Can we claim, therefore, to have solved all problems once and for 
all? Can we say now that we are immune from the modes of thought of established 
society and that we have found the "recipe" for the organization to avoid all 
bureaucratization and for the proletariat to avoid all mistakes and defeats? To 
suppose this would be to understand nothing at all of what has been said, and 
indeed, to expect a reply of this sort would be to understand nothing at all 
about the type of questions asked. The reply to those who ask for guarantees 
that a new organization will not become bureaucratized is this: "You are already 
completely bureaucratized yourselves, you are the ideal infantry of a new 
bureaucracy if you believe that by merely speculating about it, a theoretician 
will arrive at a plan that will eliminate the possibility of bureaucratization. 
The only guarantee against bureaucratization lies in your own thought and action 
- in your greatest possible participation and certainly not in your abstention."</p>

<p class="fst">We have said for some years in this journal [<i>Socialism or 
Barbarism</i>] that revolutionary activity is caught in a crucial contradiction: 
It participates in the society it is trying to abolish. This is the same sort of 
contradictory position the proletariat itself is in under capitalism. It is 
nonsensical to look now for a theoretical solution to this contradiction. No 
such solution exists, for a theoretical solution to a real contradiction is an 
absurdity. This does not warrant abstention but rather struggle. The 
contradiction resolves itself partially at each stage of action, but only 
revolution can resolve it totally. It is partially resolved in practice when a 
revolutionary puts before workers ideas that allow them to organize and clarify 
their experience - and, when these workers use these ideas to go further, to 
give rise to new, positive contents of the struggle, and eventually to "educate 
the educator." It is resolved in part when an organization proposes a form of 
struggle and this form is taken up, enriched, and broadened by the workers. It 
is resolved when genuine collective work becomes instaurated within the 
organization; when each person's ideas and experiences are discussed by the 
others, and then surpassed, to be merged in a common aim and action; and when 
militants develop themselves through their participation in every aspect of the 
life and activity of the organization.</p>

<p class="fst">None of this is ever gained once and for all, but it is only 
along these lines that progress can be made. Whatever the form of the 
organization and its activity, effective participation by militants will 
<i>always</i> be a problem, an achievement that must be reconsolidated daily. The 
problem will not be solved by decreeing that there will be no organization - 
which comes down to accepting a role of no participation whatsoever, i.e., the 
exact equivalent of the complete bureaucratic solution. Nor can it be solved by 
constitutional rules or bylaws that would automatically guarantee maximum 
participation - for no such rules exist. There are simply rules that <i>allow</i> 
for participation and others that <i>make it impossible</i>. Whatever the 
contents of the organization's revolutionary theory or program, however deep 
their connections with the experience and needs of the proletariat, there will 
always be the possibility, the <i>certainty</i> even, that at some point this 
theory and program will be outstripped by history, and there will always be the 
risk that those who have defended them up to that point will tend to make them 
into absolutes and try to subordinate and adapt the creations of living history 
to fit them. We can limit this risk and educate militants and, as a start, 
ourselves by the thought that the ultimate criterion of socialism lies in the 
people who struggle today and not in the resolutions voted on last year. But it 
can never be eliminated completely, and in any case it cannot be eliminated by 
eradicating theory and program, for this comes down to eliminating all rational 
action and to abandoning life in order to preserve bad reasons for living.</p>

<p class="fst">This contradictory situation has not been created by the 
revolutionary militant. It is imposed on him, as it is imposed on the 
proletariat, by capitalist society. What distinguishes the revolutionary 
militant from the bourgeois philosopher is that the former does not remain 
spellbound by the contradiction once he has become aware of it, but struggles to 
overcome it, not through solitary reflection or speculation, but through 
collective action. And to act is, in the first place, to get oneself 
organized.</p>

<h3><a name="h18">Remarks:</a></h3>
<p class="endnote">This text and the following one [Trans.: i.e., "The 
Proletariat and Organisation, II," which is not included in the present edition] 
were written during the summer of 1958 and circulated within the <i>S. ou B.</i> 
group in the autumn of the same year. The references to Claude Lefort's text, 
around which the comrades who left the group were united, are given later. I do 
not have anything of great import to add to the description of circumstances 
surrounding this scission furnished in the following text, for otherwise I would 
have to go into detail about the history of the group from its beginnings, a 
task that does not strike me as particularly urgent today. On the antecedents to 
this whole discussion, see also "Postface to The Revolutionary Party and 
Proletarian Leadership," L'Expérience du mouvement ouvrier, 1: Comment lutter 
(10/18, 1974), pp. 163-78. [Trans.: see volume 1 of the present edition for 
excerpts from this postface.]</p>

<p class="endnote">As for problems of a substantial nature, I still support the 
ideas formulated in the preceding text although I now consider them inadequate 
and incomplete. I do not think that it would be very useful to add many comments 
to this discussion of the year 1958, for it could only be enriched by going 
beyond the very terrain on which it took place. This terrain was very narrow 
indeed, almost exclusively sociological, rational, and operative. Questions such 
as "who agitates," "why," and "how" were barely broached at all, by either side; 
neither were the questions raised that do in fact arise at the level of groups 
of militants (such groups are far from constituting rational and transparent 
working collectives). These psychic and "psychological" factors, however, 
determine the actual functioning and the reality of such groups and 
organizations as much as general sociological factors, and much more than their 
"programs" and "bylaws."</p>

<p class="endnote">One can find a brief - and partially inaccurate - description of 
the 1958 scission (as well as an exposition of a point of view opposed to that 
formulated in "The Working Class &amp; Organisation") in the pamphlet Henri Simon 
published after his break with Informations et Correspondence Ouvrie&#768;res. Simon 
had helped found ICO after his departure from <i>S. ou B.</i> and his separation 
from Claude Lefort. The pamphlet is entitled, I.C.O.: Un point de vue, and it is 
available through the author, 34 rue St. Sebastien, Paris 75011. [Trans.: 
Photocopies can still be obtained from him at this address.] One should not be 
surprised if I say that the conclusion I have drawn after reading it is that the 
evolution of ICO and Simon's final break with it were determined in large part 
by the presence of problems whose existence and importance he refused to

<h3><a name="h19">Notes:</a></h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1]</a> The analysis of this question has occupied a central place in 
the work of Socialisme ou Barbarie. We can only summarize our conclusions here. 
See "Socialism or Barbarism," "The Relations of Production in Russia," " On the 
Content of Socialism I," etc.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n2" href="#fn2">[2]</a> Attempts have been made for a long time to reduce the factors 
that brought about the degeneration of the Russian revolution to the 
international isolation of the revolution and to the backward state of Russia. 
This "explanation" explains nothing: International isolation and the 
backwardness of the country could just as well have led (purely and simply) to 
the defeat of the revolution and to the restoration of capitalism. Such 
considerations do not in any way explain how the revolution both "succeeded" and 
degenerated at the same time. To place the emphasis on these factors is both to 
conceal the particular historical nature of developments in Russia and to ignore 
its most fruitful lessons for revolutionary practice. Isolation and backwardness 
favoured this development and gave it its concrete form. But they did not 
determine its real signification. One cannot make the process of 
bureaucratization into an accident; likewise, there is no basis for the claim 
that a widespread revolution in Germany, for example, "could not have 
degenerated." What developed out of the Russian Revolution has clearly shown 
that the problem of bureaucracy is one the whole of the international working 
class has to face and, moreover, that it cannot be solved except in terms of a 
real experience of the bureaucracy as a social reality.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n3" href="#fn3">[3]</a> See <i>S. ou B.</i>, No. 20 (December 1956), which is devoted 
almost entirely to the Hungarian Revolution, and the texts written by Hungarian 
revolutionaries, published in Nos. 21 and 23 (January and July 1958).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n4" href="#fn4">[4]</a> This confusion constitutes the main basis for James Burnham's 
pseudo-analyses of the bureaucracy. See the first chapters of The Managerial 
Revolution.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n5" href="#fn5">[5]</a> Actual wage levels are determined in the majority of cases 
much less by official wage rates, collective bargaining, and trade-union 
agreements, and much more by what happens inside the production process; the 
regulation of piece rates, the division of workers' time between different types 
of work, and especially work norms play a decisive role on this score, and all 
these factors are the object of a fierce and permanent struggle between workers 
and management.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> Bourgeois industrial sociologists like Elton Mayo have long 
realized this. Most of the time, present-day "Marxists" are fanatical defenders 
of hierarchy. However little one understands the condition of the modern firm, 
one can immediately see the stupidity of any kind of "socialism" that limits 
itself to making changes outside the firm and does not start by completely 
overthrowing the day-to-day system of production.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n7" href="#fn7">[7]</a> Advance or regression is not measured solely by the relative 
militancy of the working class, but also through its attitude toward problems it 
comes up against that cannot be reduced to political problems. The French "Left" 
takes delight in thinking the French working class is more "advanced" than the 
American or British working class because a majority of French workers support 
an organization like the CP whereas in England or the United States the workers 
vote for reformist or bourgeois parties. They have never given any attention to 
the fact that these American and English workers, whom they consider to be so 
politically "backward," are much more militant and unyielding in disputes at the 
point of production than the French workers; they don't even understand what 
these words mean.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n8" href="#fn8">[8]</a> Obviously it has other aspects too, for on the one hand it 
also expresses the self-perpetuating interests of the whole system of 
exploitation in general. And on the other hand, it must allow the bureaucratic 
organizations to maintain some hold over the working class, for without this 
hold they would be nothing. But these aspects are secondary in relation to the 
problem being discussed in the text.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n9" href="#fn9">[9]</a> These are Kautsky's formulations, which Lenin endorsed in 
<i>What Is to Be Done?</i> as "profoundly true and significant."</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n10" href="#fn10">[10]</a> That the reformists used the idea of a scientific prediction 
of the evolution of the capitalist economy to condemn the idea of revolution and 
to "prove" that we should rely on the workings of economic laws to achieve 
socialism, changes nothing.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n11" href="#fn11">[11]</a> The expression is Kautsky's and appears in his introduction 
to Capital that, published separately under the title "General Introduction to 
Marxism," served as theoretical fodder for whole generations of militants.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n12" href="#fn12">[12]</a> Nowhere does the contradiction appear more clearly than in 
Rosa Luxemburg, the revolutionary who underlined most emphatically the 
importance of the masses' own experience and autonomous action and yet who 
devoted a major theoretical work to an attempt - a vain attempt, it must be said 
- to show that the process of accumulation would lead inevitably to the downfall 
of capitalism.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n13" href="#fn13">[13]</a> It is hardly necessary to repeat that this process has been a 
contradictory one, or rather that the reality of these organizations has been 
contradictory from the very beginning and for most of their history. If these 
organizations - the trade-unions and parties of the Second and Third 
Internationals - had been "just" bureaucracies, they would have been nothing at 
all, and could not have achieved what they achieved or have played the role that 
they played. Before they degenerate completely, there is in the practice of 
these organizations the equivalent of what has been said above about Marxist 
theory itself: a double reality. It can be seen again in the example - which is 
historically without doubt the most important of all - of Lenin's positions on 
the relationship between the Party and the masses. The idea of the Party as the 
custodian of socialist consciousness and of the proletariat as being incapable 
on its own of achieving anything more than trade-unionist consciousness, plays a 
rather episodic role in <i>What Is to Be Done?</i> and Trotsky assures us in his 
Stalin that Lenin would have abandoned it eventually. Yet it is taken up again 
with vigour in <i>An Infantile Disorder</i> (1920), where Lenin opposes the 
leftists with ideas on the relationship between the Party and the masses that 
are equivalent to those of <i>What Is to Be Done?</i> But in the meantime he had 
written <i>State and Revolution</i> (1917), in which the Party is completely 
absent. These contradictions can be found even more sharply drawn in Lenin's 
line of action, sometimes putting all the emphasis on building the Party, and, 
after 1917, trying to solve every problem by means of it, sometimes being 
inspired by what was most original and most profound in what the movement of the 
masses was creating, appealing to them against the Party, and, in the last 
years, observing with anxiety the gap that was appearing between them and it. On 
this, it should be pointed out for the benefit of certain professional critics 
of bolshevism that the bureaucratic side of Leninism existed just as much - 
though in a more hypocritical way - among the Social Democrats; these critics 
never speak of the bureaucratic side of social democracy, and one would search 
there in vain for the equivalent of its revolutionary side.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n14" href="#fn14">[14]</a> As Lenin did as regards reformist bureaucracy, and Trotsky, 
as regards Stalinist bureaucracy, whose bases, they believed, would be destroyed 
by the "objective crisis" of capitalism. This kind of argument boils down in the 
end to the idea of the "inevitable downfall" of capitalism.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n15" href="#fn15">[15]</a> Trans.: Guy Mollet (1905-75) and Maurice Thorez (1900-64) 
were the secretaries-general of the SFIO and the PCF, respectively, at this 
time.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n16" href="#fn16">[16]</a> See issues 13 and 20 (January 1954 and December 1956) of this 
review and the texts reprinted in La Société bureaucratique, 2: La Révolution 
contre la bureaucratie (10/18, 1973).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n17" href="#fn17">[17]</a> See the texts on the French strikes of 1953 and 1955 and on 
the strikes in England and the United States in Nos. 13, 18, 19, and 26 (January 
1954, January and July 1956, and November 1958) of <i>S. ou B.</i> (reprinted in 
L'Expérience du mouvement ouvrier, 1: Comment lutter (10/18, 1974) [Trans.: some 
of which have been translated and appear in the present volume]). On the meaning 
of the French population's attitude toward Gaullism, see the text entitled 
"Bilan" [Trans.: not included in the present series; reprinted in L'Expérience 
du mouvement ouvrier, 2: Prolétariat et organisation (10/18, 1974), pp. 89-116].</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n18" href="#fn18">[18]</a> Trans.: Bougnoule is a racially derogatory term applied 
especially to people of North African descent.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n19" href="#fn19">[19]</a> Whatever the severity of the crisis - the events in Poland 
have demonstrated this again recently - an exploitative society can only be 
overthrown if the masses are not merely stirred into action but raise this 
action up to the level needed for a new social organization to take the place of 
the old one. If this does not happen, social life will continue and it will 
continue following the old model, though perhaps superficially changed to a 
greater or lesser degree. Now, no theory can "prove" that the masses will 
inevitably reach this requisite level of activity; such a "proof" would be a 
contradiction in terms.</p>
