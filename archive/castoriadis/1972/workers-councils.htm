<h2><a name="h1">0. Our Preface<br>
<small>by Solidarity Group (London); March 1972</small></a></h2>

<p class="fst">To the best of our knowledge there have been no serious attempts 
by modern libertarian revolutionaries to grapple with the economic and political 
problems of a totally self-managed society.</p>

<p class="fst">What might the structure, social relations and decision-making 
institutions of such a society look like, in an advanced industrial country, in 
the second half of the twentieth century? Is the technological basis of modern 
life so complex that all talk of workers' management of production can be 
dismissed as pure "utopia" (as both the beneficiaries &#8211; and most of the victims 
&#8211; of the present social order would have us believe)?</p>

<p class="fst">Or, on the contrary, isn't this allegation itself the real 
mystification? Doesn't historical experience, and in particular the working 
class experience of recent decades, prove the very opposite? Don't the very 
advances of science enhance the feasibility of a rational form of social 
organization, where real power would lie in the hands of the producers 
themselves?</p>

<p class="fst">This pamphlet seeks to deal with some of these questions. The 
events of the last few years show quite clearly that this is no longer a 
"theoretical" preoccupation, relating to some remote and problematic future. On 
the contrary, it is a real, immediate and down-to-earth concern. At any time 
between now and the end of the century, hundreds of thousands &#8211; nay, millions &#8211; 
of men and women may well be confronted with problems of the kind here 
discussed. And on the solutions ordinary people may collectively provide to 
these problems will depend whether humanity really moves to something new, or 
whether we just exchange one servitude for another.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us immediately circumscribe the relevant area. We are not 
concerned with the recipes and double-talk of various "reformed" or "partially 
reformed" bureaucracies. We are <u>not</u> concerned with "workers control" seen 
as an adjunct or decoration to nationalization and the political power of some 
vanguard Party. We are not discussing how to run, from above, a system of 
workers-management-from-below (as in Yugoslavia). We want to go a little deeper 
than those Polish bureaucrats, the only recent addition to whose wisdom seems to 
be that one shouldn't increase prices, without warning, the week before 
Christmas. We won't be examining what happened in Spain in 1936, firstly because 
this has been done before, and better than we could, and secondly, because it 
only has limited relevance to the problems of an advanced industrial country, in 
the last third of the twentieth century.</p>

<p class="fst">Nor, for much the same reasons, will we examine the withered 
remains of what may briefly have flowered in the Algerian countryside, before 
being swept away in 1965 by Boumedienne's theocratic putsch (to the plaudits, be 
it remembered, of the rulers of "Communist" China). Nor will we echo Castro's 
paeans to the "socialist" work ethic, his exhortations to his followers to "cut 
yet more sugar cane", or his fulminations against sundry slackers, uttered 
without ever seeking to discover the real source of their "slackness": their 
lack of involvement in the fundamental decisions and their refusal to 
participate in their own exploitation.</p>

<p class="fst">At the other end of the political spectrum, we will only deal in 
passing with those who believe that <u>all</u> work and <u>all</u> sorrow, 
<u>all</u> limitations on human freedom, and <u>all</u> compulsion could 
immediately be swept away, and that socialism implies the immediate transcending 
of the human condition. With the decay of every social order, various 
millenarial doctrines tend to flourish. We endorse the vision but are concerned 
with the steps for making it reality.</p>

<p class="fst">Those whom we might call "cornucopian socialists"<a href="#r1" name="rn1" target="_self">[1*]</a> will 
probably denounce us for discussing the organization and transformation of work 
(instead of its abolition). But, such is the capacity of our minds for mutually 
incompatible ideas that the very comrades who talk of abolishing all work will 
take it for granted that, under socialism, lights will go on when they press 
switches, and water flow when they turn on taps. We would gently ask them how 
the light or water will get there, who will lay the cables or pipes &#8211; and who, 
before that, will make them. We are not of those who believe that reservoirs and 
power stations are divine dispensations to socialist humanity &#8211; or that there is 
no human or social cost involved in their creation. We are intensely concerned, 
on the other hand, about how <u>collectively</u> to determine whether the cost 
is acceptable, and how it should be shared.</p>

<p class="fst">In considering various aspects of a self-managed society we will 
not be discussing the insights, however shrewd, of various writers of science 
fiction. Their undoubted merit it is that they, at least, have perceived the 
fantastic scope of what could be possible, even today. Unlike Jules Verne, we 
aren't planning to proceed "<u>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</u>" or even to 
undertake a "<u>Journey to the Centre of the Earth</u>". We just want to walk 
widely and freely on its surface, in the here-and-now. In this, we will 
immediately differentiate ourselves from most modern revolutionaries, who under 
pretext of "keeping their feet on earth" remain waist-deep in concrete.</p>

<p class="fst">This pamphlet is based on a text by P. Chaulieu ("<i><a href="../1957/socialism-2.htm">Sur Le 
Contenu du Socialisme</a></i>") which first appeared in the summer of 1957 (in issue 
Number 22 of the French journal, <i>Socialisme ou Barbarie</i>).<a href="#r2" name="rn2" target="_self">[2*]</a> It is 
important to keep the date in mind. The text was written just after the 
Hungarian Workers' Councils had been ruthlessly suppressed, following a prolonged 
and heroic struggle in which hundreds of thousands of workers had put forward 
demands for the abolition of norms, for the equalization of wages, for workers' 
management of production, for a Federation of Workers' Councils, and for control 
from below of all institutions exercising any kind of decisional authority.<a href="#r3" name="rn3" target="_self">[3*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The text was written <u>before</u> the momentous developments of 
the sixties, before the massive growth of "do-it-yourself" politics, and before 
the Berkeley events of 1964 (which showed the explosive new tensions modern 
capitalist society was busily producing). It was written before the vast spread 
&#8211; at least in Europe &#8211; of the "youth revolt" (with its deep questioning of the 
"work ethic" as such &#8211; and of so many other aspects of bourgeois culture and 
before the development of the women's liberation movement (with its widespread 
critique not only of the economic exploitation of women, but of the more subtle 
forms of exploitation inherent in the attribution of fixed polarities and roles 
to the two sexes). Finally, it was written more than a decade before the great 
events of May 1968 (despite the fact that the movement's demands for "autogestion", 
or "self-management", at times, sound like the reverberating echoes of what the 
text is talking about).</p>

<p class="fst">Way ahead of its time in 1957, the text seems dated, in some 
respects, in 1972 &#8211; not so much in what it says, which retains great freshness 
and originality, but in what it does not and could not say. Why, in view of all 
this, is <i>Solidarity</i> publishing this document at this particular time? The 
answer is twofold. Firstly, because the text remains, in our opinion, the most 
cogent, lucid and comprehensive vision of the <u>economic</u> structure of a 
modern self-managed society ever to have been published. Secondly, because we 
feel that a discussion on this theme is now fairly urgent.</p>

<p class="fst">The text does not evade difficulties, but faces them honestly and 
openly. Its scope is wide. How could institutions be made comprehensible? How 
could they be effectively controlled from below? How could relevant information 
be made available to all, so that meaningful decisions might be taken 
collectively? How could genuinely democratic planning function, in an advanced 
industrial society? But the text deals with much more: with the essential 
changes a socialist society would have to introduce into the very structure of 
work, with how a genuine consumer "market" might function, with problems of 
agriculture, with the political representation of those who do not work in large 
enterprises and with the meaning of politics in a society based on Workers' 
Councils.</p>

<p class="fst">Revolutionaries usually react to all this in one of three ways:</p>

<p class="indentb">1. For the Leninists of all ilk there is no problem. They may pay 
lip service to "proletarian democracy", "Workers Councils", and "workers' 
control", but know in their bones that, wherever necessary, their Party (which 
has as great a role to play after the revolution as before) will take the 
appropriate decisions. They dismiss workers' self-management with derogatory 
comments about "socialism in one factory" or with profundities like "you can't 
have groups of workers doing whatever they like, without taking into account the 
requirements of the economy as a whole". In this, they are tilting at men of 
straw, for libertarian revolutionaries have never claimed any such thing. 
Moreover, the Leninists utterly fail to understand what is here being proposed: 
we are <u>not</u> discussing "workers control" (seen as some adjunct or 
decoration to a hierarchy of political organs, which would genuinely embody 
decisional authority, and which would not be directly based on the producers 
themselves). What we are proposing and discussing is something much more 
fundamental, a total reorganization of society, a reorganization involving every 
one of its social relations and basic institutions.</p>

<p class="fst">Non-Leninist revolutionaries will react to what we say in two 
different ways. Either,</p>

<p class="indentb">2. "Why worry about such things? Blueprints are a waste of time. 
The workers themselves will decide when the time comes".</p>

<p class="fst">Or, more simplistically,</p>

<p class="indentb">3. "Under socialism there just won't be any problems of this 
kind. All present problems stem from the material scarcity of capitalism which a 
"free society" will immediately abolish". The text argues most cogently why 
these are short-sighted answers and describes what will probably happen if 
libertarian revolutionaries refrain from discussing these matters <u>as from now</u>.</p>

<p class="fst">One may accept or reject what the author proposes (we are not 
ourselves all agreed on his various views). But it cannot be claimed that s/he 
fails to tackle a whole range of new problems. We are here firmly in the era of 
the computer, of the knowledge explosion, of wireless and television, of 
input-output matrices, and of the problems of today's society. We have left the 
quieter waters of Owen's <u>New View of Society</u> (1813), of Morris' <u>News 
from Nowhere</u> (1891), of Blatchford's <u>Clarion</u>, or of sundry other 
socialist or anarchist utopias of earlier years.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us not be misunderstood. We are not passing value judgments. 
We are not decrying the sensitivity and deep humanity that permeated the vision 
of many earlier revolutionaries. We are merely claiming that the technological 
infrastructures of their societies and of ours are so immeasurably different as 
to make comparisons rather meaningless. Although we hate much that we see around 
us &#8211; and, in particular, many of the products of misapplied science &#8211; we don't 
want to move the clock back (incidentally, a remarkably fruitless occupation). 
We see no advantage in candles or coke over electricity, or in carrying water 
from the well when it can be got from a tap. We want to control and humanize 
<u>this</u> society (by means commensurate with its vastness), not to seek refuge 
in some mythical golden past. Nor do we use the word "utopia" in any derogatory 
sense, as contemporary Marxists so often do. We are using it in a purely 
etymological sense. Strictly speaking, "utopian" means "which exists nowhere". 
When we say that the author's proposals are <u>not</u> utopian we are saying no 
more than that his mental constructs are but extrapolations from what <u>already</u> 
exists here and now, from experiences the working class has <u>already</u> been 
through and from institutions it has <u>already</u> created.</p>

<p class="fst">We would like to contribute this pamphlet to the serious and 
sustained discussion now taking place among libertarian revolutionaries about 
<u>all</u> aspects of a self-managed society. This discussion is already ranging 
widely and fruitfully over such fields as education, conditioning by the family, 
internalized repression, urbanism, town planning, ecology, new forms of art and 
communication, new relations between people, and between people and the 
essential content of their lives. In this surge of questioning one dimension is, 
however, missing. The dimension is that of <u>economic organization</u>. The 
silence here is quite deafening. Sure, there are occasional distant echoes of 
what de Leon said before the First World War about "socialist industrial unions" 
&#8211; or about what various syndicalists have proclaimed, with diminishing 
credibility, about the need for "one big union". For modern revolutionaries, 
however, this is totally inadequate. Perhaps what we propose isn't good enough 
either, but at least it tries to grapple with the problems of <u>our</u> epoch.</p>

<p class="fst">Although economic organization isn't the be-all and end-all of 
life, it is the pre-condition of a great deal else. And it is high time 
revolutionary libertarians started discussing this subject rationally. They must 
realize that if they have no views on these matters, others (the trad[itional] 
rev[olutionarie]s) do. Politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum. If we don't want 
the economic tyranny of bourgeois society to be replaced by the tyranny of 
Party-dominated structures &#8211; masquerading as "socialism" or "workers control" &#8211; 
it is high time we explained, and in some detail, what <u>we</u> mean by 
workers' management of production and a society genuinely based on Workers 
Councils.</p>

<p class="fst">Conservatives will say that what is here outlined threatens the 
rights of management. They are dead right. The non-political will proclaim what 
many left <i>politicos</i> believe (but are reluctant to articulate), namely 
that all this is "pie in the sky" because in industry as elsewhere there must 
always be leaders, and that hierarchical organization is both inevitable and 
intrinsically rational. The liberals and Labor lefts &#8211; aware of the increasing 
cynicism with which people now regard them &#8211; will proclaim that what we say is 
"what they meant all along", when they were talking about "workers' 
participation". Having failed to grasp the essence of what we are talking about, 
they will then doubtless start arguing how it could all be introduced by 
parliamentary legislation!</p>

<p class="fst">There will be more subtle criticisms too. Those alarmed at the 
monstrosities of modern science &#8211; or those naturally suspicious of what they do 
not fully understand &#8211; will shy away from the text's bold advocacy of 
subjugating the most modern techniques to the needs of democracy. They will 
remember the "plan factory", the matrices and the coefficients, forget who will 
be determining them, and denounce the text as a "technocratic" view of 
socialism. The text will be criticized by many anarchists as containing Marxist 
residues (for instance it still attributes an enormous specific weight, in the 
process of social change, to the industrial proletariat, a weight which the 
author himself would probably gauge differently today). Moreover the document 
still envisages a "transitional" society between capitalism and communism, as 
Marx did in his <u>Critique of the Gotha Programme</u>. We will be told that the 
technical capacity of industry has increased so vastly in the last decades as to 
invalidate the need for such a phase of history. We hope to initiate a wide 
discussion on this issue.</p>

<p class="fst">Many Marxists will denounce the text as an anarchist dream 
(anarchist dreams are better than Marxist nightmares &#8211; but we would prefer, if 
possible, to remain awake!). Some will see the text as a major contribution to 
the perpetuation of wage slavery &#8211; because it still talks of "wages" and doesn't 
call for the immediate abolition of "money" (although clearly defining the 
radically different meanings these terms will acquire in the early stages of a 
self-managed society).</p>

<p class="fst">The text will also be dismissed by many in the underground. They 
will consider it irrelevant because it does not call for the immediate 
"abolition" of work. A more sophisticated criticism &#8211; but along the same lines &#8211; 
will be directed at us by the Situationists who constantly talk of "workers' 
(sic) councils ... while demanding the abolition of work! Unfortunately, they 
seem to confuse attacks on the <u>work ethic</u><a href="#r4" name="rn4" target="_self">[4*]</a> and on alienated labor, 
both of which are justified and necessary, with attacks on work itself. Such an 
approach fails to relate to the problems of transforming what exists here and 
now into what could open the way to a new society, for the construction of 
which, whether we like it or not, many million man-hours of labor will probably 
have to be expended.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally the more percipient supporters of Women's Liberation will 
correctly point out that as long as millions of women have to stay at home they 
will be grossly under-represented in the various schemes the pamphlet envisages. 
The answer here is neither to consider housework as an "industry" and encourage 
housewives to organize industrially (which would perpetuate the present state of 
affairs), nor for all authority to be vested in locality-based units. The 
position of women will change radically and new forms of representation will 
undoubtedly be created. All these are areas deserving the widest possible 
attention.</p>

<p class="fst">We hope that what is best in the text will survive the crossfire. 
We are frequently told: "your critique of modern society is telling enough. But 
it is negative. These are enormous problems. How would <u>you</u> like to see 
things organized?". Well, here at least is the draft of an answer, based on a 
coherent system of ideas. We will tell our questioner that a society, 
economically organized along the lines here described, would be infinitely 
preferable to what modern capitalist society has to offer us. And to those on 
the "far left" we would say that such a society would also be preferable to what 
they and their "vanguard Parties" are concocting "on our behalf". The ball would 
then clearly be in their court. They would have to relate to what the 
libertarians were saying, about economics as well as about other things. That 
alone, in our opinion, is reason enough for putting forward our views.</p>

<h2><a name="h2">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The development of modern society and what has happened to the 
working class movement over the last 100 years (and, in particular, since 1917) 
have compelled us radically to revise most of the ideas on which that movement 
had been based.</p>

<p class="fst">Several decades have gone by since the Russian Revolution. From 
that revolution it is not socialism that emerged, but a new and monstrous form 
of exploiting society in which the bureaucracy replaced the private owners of 
capital and "the plan" took the place of the "free market".</p>

<p class="fst">There are several basic ingredients for the revision we propose. 
The first is to assimilate the vast experience of the Russian revolution and of 
what happened to it. The next is to grasp the real significance of the Hungarian 
Workers' Councils and other uprisings against the bureaucracy. But there are 
other ingredients to the proposed revision. A look at modern capitalism, and at 
the type of conflict it breeds, shows that throughout the world working people 
are faced with the same fundamental problems, often posed in surprisingly 
similar terms. These problems call for the same answer. This answer is 
socialism, a social system which is the very opposite both of the bureaucratic 
capitalism now installed in Russia, China and elsewhere &#8211; <u>and</u> of the type 
of capitalism now prevailing in the West.</p>

<p class="fst">The experience of bureaucratic capitalism allows us clearly to 
perceive what socialism <u>is</u> <u>not</u> and <u>cannot</u> <u>be</u>. A 
close look both at past proletarian uprisings and at the everyday life and 
struggles of the working class &#8211; both East and West &#8211; enables us to posit what 
socialism could be and should be. Basing ourselves on the experience of a 
century we can and must now define the positive content of socialism in a much 
fuller and more accurate way than could previous revolutionaries. In today's 
vast ideological morass, people who call themselves socialists may be heard to 
assert that "they are no longer quite sure what the word means". We hope to show 
that the very opposite is the case. Today, for the first time, one can begin to 
spell out in concrete and specific terms what socialism could really be like.</p>

<p class="fst">The task we are about to undertake does not only lead us to 
challenge many widely held ideas about socialism, many of which go back to Lenin 
and some to Marx. It also leads us to question widely held ideas about 
capitalism, about the way it works and about the real nature of its crises, 
ideas many of which have reached us (with or without distortion) from Marx 
himself. The two analyses are complementary and, in fact, the one necessitates 
the other. One cannot understand the deepest essence of capitalism and its 
crises without a total conception of socialism. For socialism implies human 
autonomy, the conscious management by people of their own lives. Capitalism &#8211; 
both private and bureaucratic &#8211; is the ultimate negation of this autonomy, and 
its crises stem from the fact that the system necessarily creates this drive to 
autonomy, while simultaneously being compelled to suppress it.</p>

<p class="fst">The revision we propose did not of course start today. Various 
strands of the revolutionary movement &#8211; and a number of individual 
revolutionaries &#8211; have contributed to it over a period. In the very first issue 
of <i>Socialisme ou Barbarie</i><a href="#r5" name="rn5" target="_self">[5*]</a> we claimed that the fundamental division in 
contemporary societies was the division into order-givers (<i>dirigeants</i>) 
and order-takers (<i>exécutants</i>). We attempted to show how the working 
class's own development would lead it to a socialist consciousness. We stated 
that socialism could only be the product of the autonomous action of the working 
class. We stressed that a socialist society implied the abolition of any 
separate stratum of order-givers and that it therefore implied power at the base 
and workers' management of production.</p>

<p class="fst">But, in a sense, we ourselves have failed to develop our own 
ideas to the full. It would hardly be worth mentioning this fact were it not 
that it reflected &#8211; at its own level &#8211; the influence of factors which have 
dominated the evolution of revolutionary theory for a century, namely the 
enormous dead-weight of the ideology of exploiting society, the paralyzing 
legacy of traditional concepts and the difficulty of freeing oneself from 
inherited methods of thought.</p>

<p class="fst">In one sense, our revision consists of making more explicit and 
precise what has always been the deepest content of working class struggles &#8211; 
whether at their dramatic and culminating moments (revolution) or in the 
anonymity of working class life in the factory. In another sense, our revision 
consists in freeing revolutionary thought from the accumulated clinker of a 
century. We want to break the deforming prisms through which so many 
revolutionaries have become used to looking at the society around them.</p>

<p class="fst">Socialism aims at giving a meaning to the life and work of 
people; at enabling their freedom, their creativity and the most positive 
aspects of their personality to flourish; at creating organic links between the 
individual and those around him, and between the group and society; at 
overcoming the barriers between manual and mental work; at reconciling people 
with themselves and with nature. It thereby rejoins the most deeply felt 
aspirations of the working class in its daily struggles against capitalist 
alienation. These are not longings relating to some hazy and distant future. 
They are feelings and tendencies existing and manifesting themselves today, both 
in revolutionary struggles and in everyday life. To understand this is to 
understand that, <u>for the worker</u>, <u>the final problem of history is an 
everyday problem</u>.</p>

<p class="fst">To grasp this is also to perceive that socialism is not 
"nationalization" or "planning" or even an "increase in living standards". It is 
to understand that the real crisis of capitalism is not due to "the anarchy of 
the market", or to "overproduction" or to "the falling rate of profit". Taken to 
their logical conclusion, and grasped in all their implications, these ideas 
alter one's concepts of revolutionary theory, action and organization. They 
transform one's vision of society and of the world.</p>

<h2><a name="h3">2. The Crisis of Capitalism</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The capitalist organization of social life (both East and West) 
creates a constantly renewed crisis in every aspect of human activity. This 
crisis appears most intensely in the realm of production,<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> although in its 
essence, the problem is the same in other fields, i.e., whether one is dealing 
with the family, with education, with culture, with politics or with 
international relations.</p>

<p class="fst">Everywhere, the capitalist structure of society imposes on people 
an organization of their lives that is external to them. It organizes things in 
the absence of those most directly concerned and often against their aspirations 
and interests. This is but another way of saying that capitalism divides society 
into a narrow stratum of order-givers (whose function is to decide and organize 
everything) and the vast majority of the population who are reduced to carrying 
out (executing) the decisions of those in power. As a result of this very fact, 
most people experience their own lives as something alien to them.</p>

<p class="fst">This pattern of organization is profoundly irrational and full of 
contradictions. Under it, repeated crises of one kind or another are absolutely 
inevitable. It is nonsensical to seek to organize people, either in production 
or in politics, as if they were mere objects, ignoring systematically what they 
themselves wish or how they themselves think things should be done. In real 
life, capitalism is obliged to base itself on people's capacity for self 
organization, on the individual and collective creativity of the producers. 
Without these it could not survive for a day. But the whole "official" 
organization of modern society both ignores and seeks to suppress these 
abilities to the utmost. The result is not only an enormous waste due to 
untapped capacity. The system does more: it necessarily engenders opposition, a 
struggle against it by those upon whom it seeks to impose itself. Long before 
one can speak of revolution or of political consciousness, people refuse in 
their everyday working life to be treated as objects. The capitalist 
organization of society is thereby compelled not only to structure itself in the 
absence of those most directly concerned, but to take shape against them. The 
net result is not only waste but perpetual conflict.</p>

<p class="fst">If a thousand individuals have amongst them a given capacity for 
self-organization, capitalism consists in more or less arbitrarily choosing 
fifty of these individuals, of vesting them with managerial authority and of 
deciding that the others should just be cogs. Metaphorically speaking, this is 
already a 95&nbsp;% loss of social initiative and drive. But there is more to it. As 
the 950 ignored individuals are not cogs, and as capitalism is obliged up to a 
point to base itself on their human capacities and in fact to develop them, 
these individuals will react and struggle against what the system imposes upon 
them.</p>

<p class="fst">The creative faculties which they are not allowed to exercise on 
behalf of a social order which rejects them (and which they reject) are now 
utilized against that social order. A permanent struggle develops at the very 
kernel of social life. It soon becomes the source of further waste. The narrow 
stratum of order-givers has henceforth to divide its time between organizing the 
work of those "below" and seeking to counteract, neutralize, deflect or 
manipulate their resistance. The function of the managerial apparatus ceases to 
be merely organization and soon assumes all sorts of coercive aspects. Those in 
authority in a large modern factory in fact spend less of their time in 
organization of production than in coping, directly or indirectly, with the 
resistance of the exploited &#8211; whether it be a question of supervision, of 
quality control, of determining piece rates, of "human relations", of 
discussions with shop stewards or union representatives. On top of all this 
there is of course the permanent preoccupation of those in power with making 
sure that everything is measurable, quantifiable, verifiable, controllable, so 
as to deal in advance with any counteraction the workers might launch against 
new methods of exploitation. The same applies, with all due corrections, to the 
total organization of social life and to all the essential activities of any 
modern state.</p>

<p class="fst">The irrationality and contradictions of capitalism do not only 
show up in the way social life is organized. They appear even more clearly when 
one looks at the real content of the life which the system proposes. More than 
any other social order, capitalism has made of work the center of human activity 
and more than any other social order capitalism makes of work something that is 
absurd (absurd not from the viewpoint of the philosopher or of the moralist, but 
from the point of view of those who have to perform it). What is challenged 
today is not only the "human organization" of work, but its nature, its methods, 
its objectives, the very instruments and purpose of capitalist production. The 
two aspects are of course inseparable, but it is the second that needs 
stressing.</p>

<p class="fst">As a result of the nature of work in a capitalist enterprise, and 
however it may be organized, the activity of the worker instead of being the 
organic expression of his human faculties becomes something which dominates him 
as an alien and hostile force. In theory, the worker is only tied to this 
activity by a thin (but unbreakable) thread: the need to earn a living. But this 
ensures that even the day that is about to start dawns before him as something 
hostile. Work under capitalism therefore implies a permanent mutilation, a 
perpetual waste of creative capacity, and a constant struggle between the worker 
and his own activity, between what s/he would like to do and what s/he has to 
do.</p>

<p class="fst">From this angle too, capitalism can only survive to the extent 
that it cannot fashion reality to its moulds. The system only functions to the 
extent that the "official" organization of production and of society are 
constantly resisted, thwarted, corrected and completed by the effective 
self-organization of people. Work processes can only be efficient under 
capitalism to the extent that the real attitudes of workers towards their work 
differ from what is prescribed. Working people succeed in appropriating the 
general principles relating to their work &#8211; to which, according to the spirit of 
the system, they should have no access and concerning which the system seeks to 
keep them in the dark. They then apply these principles to the specific 
conditions in which they find themselves whereas in theory this practical 
application can only be spelled out by the managerial apparatus.</p>

<p class="fst">Exploiting societies persist because those whom they exploit help 
them to survive. But capitalism differs from all previous exploiting societies. 
Slave-owning and feudal societies perpetuated themselves because ancient slaves 
and medieval serfs worked according to the norms of those societies. The working 
class enables capitalism to continue by acting against the system. But 
capitalism can only function to the extent that those it exploits actively 
oppose everything the system seeks to impose upon them.<a href="#r6" name="rn6" target="_self">[6*]</a> The final outcome of 
this struggle is socialism namely the elimination of all externally-imposed 
norms, methods and patterns of organization and the total liberation of the 
creative and self-organizing capacities of the masses.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="h4">3. Basic Principles of Socialist Society</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Socialist society implies the organization by people themselves 
of every aspect of their social life. The establishment of socialism therefore 
entails the immediate abolition of the fundamental division of society into a 
stratum of order-givers and a mass of order-takers.</p>

<p class="fst">The content of the socialist reorganization of society is first 
of all workers' management of production. The working class has repeatedly 
staked its claim to such management and struggled to achieve it at the high 
points of its historic actions: in Russia in 1917-18, in Italy in 1920, in Spain 
in 1936, in Hungary in 1956.</p>

<p class="fst">Workers' Councils, based on the place of work, are the <u>form</u> 
workers' self-management will probably take and the institution most likely to 
foster its growth. Workers' management means the power of the local Workers' 
Councils and ultimately, at the level of society as a whole, the power of the 
Central Assembly of Workers Council Delegates.<a href="#r7" name="rn7" target="_self">[7*]</a> Factory Councils (or Councils 
based on any other place of work such as a plant, building site, mine, railway 
yard, office, etc.) will be composed of delegates elected by the workers and 
revocable by them, at any time, and will unite the functions of deliberation, 
decision and execution. Such Councils are historic creations of the working 
class. They have come to the forefront every time the question of power has been 
posed in modern society. The Russian Factory Committees of 1917, the German 
Workers' Councils of 1919, the Hungarian Councils of 1956 all sought to express 
(whatever their name) the same original, organic and characteristic working 
class pattern of self-organization.<a href="#r8" name="rn8" target="_self">[8*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Concretely to define the socialist organization of society is 
amongst other things to draw all the possible conclusions from two basic ideas: 
workers' management of production and the rule of the Councils. But such a 
definition can only come to life and be given flesh and blood if combined with 
an account of how the institutions of a free, socialist society might function 
in practice.</p>

<p class="fst">There is no question of us here trying to draw up "statutes", 
"rules", or an "ideal constitution" for socialist society. Statutes, as such, 
mean nothing. The best of statutes can only have meaning to the extent that 
people are permanently prepared to defend what is best in them, to make up what 
they lack, and to change whatever they may contain that has become inadequate or 
outdated. From this point of view we must obviously avoid any fetishism of the 
"Council" type of organization. The "constant eligibility and revocability of 
representatives" are of themselves quite insufficient to "guarantee" that a 
Council will remain the expression of working class interests. The Council will 
remain such an expression for as long as people are prepared to do whatever may 
be necessary for it to remain so. The achievement of socialism is not a question 
of better legislation. It depends on the constant self-activity of people and on 
their capacity to find within themselves the necessary awareness of ends and 
means, the necessary solidarity and determination.</p>

<p class="fst">But to be socially effective this autonomous mass action cannot 
remain amorphous, fragmented and dispersed. It will find expression in patterns 
of action and forms of organization, in ways of doing things and ultimately in 
institutions which embody and reflect its purpose. Just as we must avoid the 
fetishism of "statutes" we should also see the shortcomings of various types of 
"anarchist" or "spontaneist" fetishism, which in the belief that in the last 
resort working class consciousness will determine everything, takes little or no 
interest in the forms such consciousness should take, if it is really to change 
reality. The Council is not a gift bestowed by some libertarian God. It is not a 
<u>miraculous</u> institution. It cannot be a popular mouthpiece if the people do 
not wish to express themselves through its medium. But the Council is an 
<u>adequate</u> form of organization: its whole structure is such that it enables 
working class aspirations to come to light and find expression. 
Parliamentary-type institutions, on the other hand, whether called "House of 
Commons", or "Supreme Soviet of the USSR", are by definition types of 
institutions that cannot be socialist. They are founded on a radical separation 
between the people, "consulted" from time to time, and those who are deemed to 
"represent" them, but who are in fact beyond meaningful popular control. A 
Workers' Council is designed so as to represent working people, but may cease to 
fulfill this function. Parliament is designed so as not to represent the people 
and never ceases to fulfill this function.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The question of adequate and meaningful institutions is central 
to socialist society. It is particularly important as socialism can only come 
about through a revolution, that is to say, as the result of a social crisis in 
the course of which the consciousness and activity of the masses reach extremely 
high levels. Under these conditions the masses become capable of breaking the 
power of the ruling class and of its armed forces, of bypassing the political 
and economic institutions of established society, and of transcending within 
themselves the heavy legacy of centuries of oppression. This state of affairs 
should not be thought of as some kind of paroxysm, but on the contrary as the prefiguration of the level of both activity and awareness demanded of men in a 
free society.</p>

<p class="fst">The "ebbing" of revolutionary activity has nothing inevitable 
about it. It will always remain a threat however, given the sheer enormity of 
the tasks to be tackled. Everything which adds to the innumerable problems 
facing popular mass action will enhance the tendency to such a reflux. It is, 
therefore, crucial for the revolution to provide itself, from its very first 
days, with a network of adequate structures to express its will and for 
revolutionaries to have some idea as to how these structures might function and 
interrelate. There can be no organizational or ideological vacuum in this 
respect and if libertarian revolutionaries remain blissfully unaware of these 
problems and have not discussed or even envisaged them they can rest assured 
that others have. It is essential that revolutionary society should create for 
itself, at each stage, those structures that can most readily become effective 
"normal" mechanisms for the expression of popular will, both in "important 
affairs" and in everyday life (which is of course the first and foremost of all 
"important affairs").</p>

<p class="fst">The definition of socialist society that we are attempting 
therefore requires of us some description of how we visualize its institutions, 
and the way they will function. This endeavor is not "utopian", for it is but 
the elaboration and extrapolation of historical creations of the working class, 
and in particular of the concept of workers' management. The ideas we propose to 
develop are only the theoretical formulation of the experience of a century of 
working class struggles. They embody real experiences (both positive and 
negative), conclusions (both direct and indirect) that have already been drawn, 
answers given to problems actually posed or answers which would have had to be 
given if such and such a revolution had developed a little further. Every 
sentence in this text is linked to questions which implicitly or explicitly have 
already been met in the course of working class struggles. This should put a 
stop once and for all to allegations of "utopianism".<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">a. Institutions that People can Understand and Control</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Self-management will only be possible if people's attitudes to 
social organization alter radically. This in turn, will only take place if 
social institutions become a meaningful part of their real daily life. Just as 
work will only have a meaning when people understand and dominate it, so will 
the institutions of socialist society only become meaningful when people both 
understand and control them.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Modern society is a dark and incomprehensible jungle, a confusion 
of apparatuses, structures and institutions whose workings almost no one 
understands or takes any interest in. Socialist society will only be possible if 
it brings about a radical change in this state of affairs and massively 
simplifies social organization. Socialism implies that the organization of a 
society will have become transparent for those who make up that society.</p>

<p class="fst">To say that the workings and institutions of socialist society 
must be easy to understand implies that people must have a maximum of 
information. This "maximum of information" is something quite different from an 
enormous mass of data. The problem isn't to equip everybody with portable 
microfilms of everything that's in the British Museum. On the contrary, the 
<u>maximum of information</u> depends first and foremost in a <u>reduction of data 
to their essentials</u>, so that they can readily be handled by all. This will 
be possible because socialism will result in an immediate and enormous 
simplification of problems and the disappearance, pure and simple, of most 
current rules and regulations which will have become quite meaningless. To this 
will be added a systematic effort to gather and disseminate information about 
social reality, and to present facts both adequately and simply. Further on, 
when discussing the functioning of socialist economy, we will give examples of 
the enormous possibilities that already exist in this field.</p>

<p class="fst">Under socialism people will dominate the working and institutions 
of society. Socialism will therefore have, for the first time in human history, 
to institute democracy. Etymologically, the word <i>democracy</i> means 
domination by the masses. We are not here concerned with the formal aspects of 
this domination. Real domination must not be confused with voting. A vote, even 
a "free" vote, may only be &#8211; and often only is &#8211; a parody of democracy. Real 
democracy is not the right to vote on secondary issues. It is not the right to 
appoint rulers who will then decide, without control from below, on all the 
essential questions. Nor does democracy consist in calling upon people 
electorally to comment upon incomprehensible questions or upon questions which 
have no meaning for them. <u>Real domination consists in being able to decide 
for oneself</u>, <u>on all essential questions</u>, <u>in full knowledge of the 
relevant facts</u>.</p>

<p class="fst">In these few words "in full knowledge of the relevant facts" lies 
the whole problem of democracy.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> There is little point in asking people to 
pronounce themselves if they are not aware of the relevant facts. This has long 
been stressed by the reactionary or fascist critics of bourgeois "democracy", 
and even by the more cynical Stalinists<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> or Fabians.<a href="#r9" name="rn9" target="_self">[9*]</a> It is obvious that 
bourgeois "democracy" is a farce, if only because literally nobody in 
contemporary society can express an opinion in full knowledge of the relevant 
facts, least of all the mass of the people from whom political and economic 
realities and the real meaning of the questions asked are systematically hidden. 
But the answer is not to vest power in the hands of an incompetent and 
uncontrollable bureaucracy. The answer is so to transform social reality that 
essential data and fundamental problems are understood by all, enabling all to 
express opinions "in full knowledge of the relevant facts".</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h6">b. Direct Democracy and Centralization</a></h3>

<p class="fst">To decide means to decide for oneself. To decide who is to decide 
is already not quite deciding for oneself. The only total form of democracy is 
therefore <u>direct democracy</u>.</p>

<p class="fst">To achieve the widest and most meaningful direct democracy will 
require that all the economic and political structures of society be based on 
local groups that are real, organic social units. Direct democracy certainly 
requires the physical presence of citizens in a given place, when decisions have 
to be taken. But this is not enough. It also requires that these citizens form 
an organic community, that they live if possible in the same milieu, that they 
be familiar through their daily experience with the subjects to be discussed and 
with the problems to be tackled. It is only in such units that the political 
participation of individuals can become total, that people can know and feel 
that their involvement is meaningful and that the real life of the community is 
being determined by its own members and not by some external agency, acting "on 
behalf of" the community. There must therefore be the maximum autonomy and 
self-management for the local units.</p>

<p class="fst">Modern social life has already created these collectivities and 
continues to create them. They are units based on medium-sized or larger 
enterprises and are to be found in industry, transport, building, commerce, the 
banks, public administration, etc., where people in hundreds, thousands or 
tens-of-thousands spend the main part of their life harnessed to common work, 
coming up against society in its most concrete form. A place of work is not only 
a unit of production: it has become the primary unit of social life for the vast 
majority of people. Instead of basing itself on geographical units, which 
economic development has often rendered highly artificial, the political 
structure of socialism will be largely based on collectivities involved in 
similar work. Such collectivities will prove the fertile soil on which direct 
democracy can nourish as they did (for similar reasons) in the ancient city or 
in the democratic communities of free farmers in the United States in the 19th 
century.</p>

<p class="fst">Direct democracy gives an idea of the <u>decentralization</u> 
which socialist society will be able to achieve. But an industrially advanced 
free society will also have to find a means of democratically integrating these 
basic units into the social fabric as a whole. It will have to solve the 
difficult problem of the necessary centralization, without which the life of a 
modern community would collapse.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not centralization as such which has made of modern 
societies such outstanding examples of political alienation or which has led to 
minorities politically expropriating the majority. This has been brought about 
by the development of bodies separate from and "above" the general population, 
bodies exclusively and specifically concerned with the function of 
centralization. As long as centralization is conceived of as the specific 
function of a <u>separate</u>, <u>independent</u> apparatus, bureaucracy is 
indeed inseparable from centralization. But in a socialist society there will be 
no conflict between centralization and the autonomy of local organizations, for 
both functions will be exercised by the same institutions. There will be no 
separate apparatus whose function it will be to reunite what it has itself 
smashed up, which absurd task (need we recall it) is precisely the function of a 
modern bureaucracy.<a href="#r10" name="rn10" target="_self">[10*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Bureaucratic centralization is a feature of all modern exploiting 
societies. The intimate links between centralization and totalitarian 
bureaucratic rule, in such class societies, provokes a healthy and 
understandable aversion to centralization among many contemporary 
revolutionaries. But this response is often confused and at times it reinforces 
the very things it seeks to correct. "Centralization, there's the root of all 
evil" proclaim many honest militants as they break with Stalinism or Leninism in 
either East or West. But this formulation, at best ambiguous, becomes positively 
harmful when it leads as it often does &#8211; either to formal demands for the 
"fragmentation of power" or to demands for a limitless extension of the powers 
of base groupings, neglecting what is to happen at other levels.</p>

<p class="fst">When Polish militants, for instance, imagine they have found a 
solution to the problem of bureaucracy when they advocate a social life 
organized and led by "several centers" (the State Administration, a 
Parliamentary Assembly, the Trade Unions, Workers' Councils and Political 
Parties) they are arguing beside the point. They fail to see that this 
"polycentrism" is equivalent to the absence of any real and identifiable center, 
controlled from below. And as modern society has to take certain central 
decisions the "constitution" they propose will only exist on paper. It will only 
serve to hide the re-emergence of a real, but this time masked (and therefore, 
uncontrollable) "center", from amid the ranks of the political bureaucracy.</p>

<p class="fst">The reason is obvious: if one fragments any institution 
accomplishing a significant or vital function one only creates an enhanced need 
for some other institution to reassemble the fragments. Similarly, if one merely 
advocates an extension of the powers of local Councils, one is thereby handing 
them over to domination by a central bureaucracy which alone would "know" or 
"understand" how to make the economy function as a whole (and modern economies, 
whether one likes it or not, <u>do</u> function as a whole). For libertarian 
revolutionaries to duck these difficulties and to refuse to face up to the 
question of central power is tantamount to leaving the solution of these 
problems to some bureaucracy or other.</p>

<p class="fst">Libertarian society will therefore have to provide a libertarian 
solution to the problem of centralization. This answer could be the assumption 
of carefully defined and circumscribed authority by a Federation of Workers' 
Councils and the creation of a Central Assembly of Councils and of a Council 
Administration. We will see further on that such an Assembly and such an 
Administration do not constitute a <u>delegation</u> of popular power but are, 
on the contrary, an <u>instrument</u> of that power. At this stage we only want 
to discuss the principles that might govern the relationship of such bodies to 
the local Councils and other base groups. These principles are important, for 
they would affect the functioning of nearly all institutions in a libertarian 
society.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h7">c. The Flow of Information and Decisions</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In a society where the people have been robbed of political 
power, and where this power is in the hands of a centralizing authority the 
essential relationship between the center and the periphery can be summed up as 
follows: channels from the periphery to the center only transmit <u>information</u>, 
whereas channels from the center to the periphery transmit decisions (plus, 
perhaps, that minimum of information deemed necessary for the understanding and 
execution of the decisions taken at the center). The whole set-up reflects not 
only <u>a monopoly of decisional authority</u>, but also a monopoly of the 
conditions necessary for the exercise of power. The center alone has the "sum 
total" of information needed to evaluate and decide. In modern society, it can 
only be by accident that any individual or body gains access to information 
other than that relating to his immediate milieu. The system seeks to avoid, or 
at any rate, it doesn't encourage such "accidents".</p>

<p class="fst">When we say that in a socialist society the central bodies will 
not constitute a delegation of power but will be the expression of the power of 
the people we are implying a radical change in all this. One of the main 
functions of central bodies will be to collect, transmit and disseminate 
information collected and conveyed to them by local groups. In all essential 
fields, decisions will be taken at grassroots level and will be notified to the 
"center", whose responsibility it will be to help or follow their progress. A 
two-way flow of information and recommendations will be instituted and this will 
not only apply to relations between the Administration and the Councils, but 
will be a model for relations between all institutions and those who comprise 
them.</p>

<p class="fst">We must stress once again that we are not trying to draw up 
perfect blueprints. It is obvious for instance that to collect and disseminate 
information is not a socially neutral function. All information cannot be 
disseminated &#8211; it would be the surest way of smothering what is relevant and 
rendering it incomprehensible and therefore uncontrollable. The role of any 
central bodies is therefore political, even in this respect.</p>

<h2><a name="h8">4. Socialism and the Transformation of Work</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Socialism will only be brought about by the autonomous action of 
the majority of the population. Socialist society is nothing other than the 
self-organization of this autonomy. Socialism both presupposes this autonomy, 
and helps to develop it.</p>

<p class="fst">But if this autonomy is people's conscious domination over <u>all</u> 
their activities, it is clear that we can't just concern ourselves with 
political autonomy. Political autonomy is but a derivative aspect of what is the 
central content and problem of socialism: to institute the domination of mankind 
over the work process.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> A purely political autonomy would be meaningless. One 
can't imagine a society where people would be slaves in production every day of 
the week, and then enjoy Sundays of political freedom.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> The idea that 
socialist production or a socialist economy could be run, at any particular 
level, by managers (themselves supervised by Councils, or Soviets, or by any 
other body "incarnating the political power of the working class") is quite 
nonsensical. Real power in any such society would rapidly fall into the hands of 
those who managed production. The Councils or Soviets would rapidly wither amid 
the general indifference of the population. People would stop devoting time, 
interest, or activity to institutions which no longer really influenced the 
pattern of their lives.</p>

<p class="fst">Autonomy is therefore meaningless unless it implies workers' 
management of production, and this at the levels of the shop, of the plant, of 
whole industries, and of the economy as a whole. But, workers' management is not 
just a new administrative technique. It cannot remain external to the structure 
of work itself. It doesn't mean keeping work as it is, and just replacing the 
bureaucratic apparatus which currently manages production by a Workers' Council 
&#8211; however democratic or revocable such a Council might be. It means that for the 
mass of people, new relations will have to develop with their work, and about 
their work. The very <u>content</u> of work will immediately have to alter.</p>

<p class="fst">Today, the purpose, means, methods, and rhythms of work are 
determined, from the outside, by the bureaucratic managerial apparatus. This 
apparatus can only manage through resort to universal, abstract rules, 
determined "once and for all". These rules cover such matters as norms of 
production, technical specifications, rates of pay, bonus, and how production 
areas will be organized. The periodic revision of these rules regularly results 
in "crises" in the organization of production. Once the bureaucratic managerial 
apparatus has been eliminated, this sort of structure of production will have to 
disappear, both in form and content.</p>

<p class="fst">In accord with the deepest of working-class aspirations, already 
tentatively expressed at the heights of working-class struggle, production norms 
will be abolished altogether, and complete equality in wages will be 
instituted.<a href="#r11" name="rn11" target="_self">[11*]</a> These measures, taken together as a first step, will put an end 
to exploitation and to all the externally imposed constraints and coercions in 
production. To the extent that work will still be necessary (and this itself 
will be a matter for constant review by society as a whole), work discipline 
will be a matter of relations between the individual work and the group with 
which s/he works, of relations between groups of workers and the shop as a 
whole, and of relations between various shops, and the General Assembly of the 
Factory or Enterprise.</p>

<p class="fst">Workers' management is therefore not the "supervision" of a 
bureaucratic managerial apparatus by representatives of the workers. Nor is it 
the replacement of this apparatus by another, formed of individuals of 
working-class origin. It is the <u>abolition</u> of <u>any</u> separate 
managerial apparatus and the restitution of the functions of such an apparatus 
to the community of workers. The Factory Council isn't a new managerial 
apparatus. It is but one of the places in which coordination takes place, a 
"local headquarters" from which contacts between the factory and the outside 
world are regulated.</p>

<p class="fst">If this is achieved, it will imply that the nature and content of 
work are already beginning to alter. Today, work consists essentially in obeying 
instructions initiated elsewhere. Workers' management will mean the reuniting of 
the functions of decision and execution. But, even this will be insufficient &#8211; 
or rather, it will immediately lead on to something else. The restitution of 
managerial functions to the workers will inevitably lead them to tackle what is, 
today, the kernel of alienation, namely the technological structure of work, 
which results in work dominating the workers instead of being dominated by them. 
This problem will not be solved overnight, but its solution will be the task of 
that historical period which we call socialism. Socialism is, first and 
foremost, the solution of <u>this particular problem</u>.</p>

<p class="fst">Between capitalism and communism there aren't 36 types of 
"transitional society", as some have sought to make us believe. There is but 
one: socialism. And, the main characteristic of socialism isn't "the development 
of the productive forces", or "the increasing satisfaction of consumer needs", 
or "an increase of political freedom". The hallmark of socialism is the change 
it will bring about in the nature and content of work, through the conscious and 
deliberate transformation of an inherited technology. For the first time in 
human history, technology will be subordinated to human needs (not only to the 
people's needs as consumers but also to their needs as <u>producers</u>).</p>

<p class="fst">The socialist revolution will allow this process to begin. Its 
completion will mark the entry of humanity into the communist era. Everything 
else &#8211; politics, consumption, etc. &#8211; are consequences or implications, which one 
must certainly look at in their organic unity, but which can only acquire such a 
unity or meaning through their relation to the key problem: the transformation 
of work itself. Human freedom will remain an illusion and a mystification if it 
doesn't mean freedom in people's fundamental activity: the activity which 
produces. And, this freedom will not be a gift bestowed by nature. It will not 
automatically arise, out of other developments. It will have to be consciously 
<u>created</u>. In the last analysis, this is the content of socialism.</p>

<p class="fst">Important practical consequences flow from all this. Changing the 
nature of work will be tackled from both ends. On the one hand, conditions will 
be created which will allow the fullest possible development of people's human 
capacities and faculties. This will imply the systematic dismantling, stone by 
stone, of the whole edifice of the division of labor. On the other hand, people 
will have to give a whole new orientation to technical developments, and to how 
they may apply to production. These are but two aspects of the same thing: man's 
relation to technique.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us start by looking at the second, more tangible, point: 
technical development as such. As a first approximation, one could say that 
capitalist technology (the current application of technique to production) is 
rotten at the core because it doesn't help people dominate their work, its aim 
being the very opposite. Socialists often say that what is basically wrong with 
capitalist technology is that it seeks to develop production for purposes of 
profit, or that it develops production for production's sake, independently of 
human needs (people being conceived of, in these arguments, only as potential 
consumers of products). The same socialists then tell us that the purpose of 
socialism is to adapt production to the real consumer needs of society, both in 
relation to volume and to the nature of the goods produced.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course, all this is true, and any society lies condemned in 
which a single child or adult goes hungry. But the more fundamental problem lies 
elsewhere.</p>

<p class="fst">Capitalism does not utilize a socially neutral technology for 
capitalist ends. Capitalism has created a capitalist technology, for its <u>own</u> 
ends, which are by no means neutral. The real essence of capitalist technology 
is not to develop production for production's sake: it is to subordinate and 
dominate the producers. Capitalist technology is primarily characterized by its 
drive to eliminate the human element in productive labor and, in the long run, 
to eliminate man altogether from the productive process. That here, as 
elsewhere, capitalism fails to fulfill its deepest tendency &#8211; and that it would 
fall to pieces if it achieved its purpose &#8211; does not affect the argument. On the 
contrary, it only highlights another aspect of the crisis of the system.</p>

<p class="fst">Capitalism cannot count on the voluntary cooperation of the 
producers. On the contrary, it has constantly to face their hostility (or, at 
best, indifference). This is why it is <u>essential</u> for the machine to 
impose <u>its</u> rhythm on the work process. Where this isn't possible 
capitalism seeks at least to measure the work performed. In every productive 
process, work <u>must</u> therefore be definable, quantifiable, controllable 
from the outside. As long as capitalism can't dispense with workers altogether, 
it <u>has</u> to make them as interchangeable as possible and to reduce their 
work to its simplest expression, that of unskilled labor. There is no conscious 
conspiracy or plot behind all this.</p>

<p class="fst">There is only a process of "natural selection", affecting 
technical inventions as they are applied to industry. Some are preferred to 
others and are, on the whole, more widely utilized. These are the ones which 
slot in with capitalism's basic need to deal with labor-power as a measurable, 
controllable and interchangeable commodity.</p>

<p class="fst">There is no capitalist chemistry or capitalist physics as such &#8211; 
but, there is certainly a capitalist technology, if by this, one means that of 
the "spectrum" of techniques available at a given point in time (which is 
determined by the development of science) a given group (or "band") will be 
selected. From the moment the development of science permits a choice of several 
possible techniques, a society will regularly choose those methods which have a 
meaning for it, which are "rational" in the light of its own class rationality. 
But the "rationality" of an exploiting society is not the rationality of 
socialism.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> The conscious transformation of technology will, therefore, be a 
central task of a society of free workers.</p>

<p class="fst">Marx, as is well known, was the first to go beyond the surface of 
the economic phenomena of capitalism (such as the market, competition, 
distribution, etc.) and to tackle the analysis of the key area of capitalist 
social relations: the concrete relations of production in the capitalist 
factory. But "Volume I" of <u>Capital</u> is still awaiting completion. The most 
striking feature of the degeneration of the Marxist movement is that this 
particular concern of Marx's, the most fundamental of all, was soon abandoned, 
even by the best of Marxists, in favour of the analysis of the "important" 
phenomena. Through this very fact, these analyses were either totally distorted, 
or found themselves dealing with very partial aspects of reality, thereby 
leading to judgments that proved catastrophically wrong.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus, it is striking to see Rosa Luxembourg devote two important 
volumes to the <u>Accumulation of Capital</u>, in which she totally ignores what 
this process of accumulation really means as to the relations of production. Her 
concern in these volumes was solely about the possibility of a global 
equilibrium between production and consumption and she was finally led to 
believe she had discovered a process of automatic collapse of capitalism (an 
idea, needless to say, concretely false and <i>a priori</i> absurd). It is just 
as striking to see Lenin, in his <u>Imperialism</u>, start from the correct and 
fundamental observation that the concentration of capital has reached the stage 
of the domination of the monopolies &#8211; and yet, neglect the transformation of the 
relations of production in the capitalist factory, which results precisely from 
such a concentration, and ignore the crucial phenomenon of the constitution of 
an enormous apparatus managing production, which was, henceforth, to incarnate 
exploitation. He preferred to see the main consequences of the concentration of 
capital in the transformation of capitalists into "coupon-clipping" rentiers. 
The working class movement is still paying the price of the consequences of this 
way of looking at things. In so far as ideas play a role in history, Khrushchev 
is in power in Russia as a by-product of the conception that exploitation can 
only take the form of coupon-clipping.</p>

<p class="fst">But, we must go further back still. We must go back to Marx 
himself. Marx threw a great deal of light on the alienation of the producer in 
the course of capitalist production and on the enslavement of man by the 
mechanical universe he had created. But Marx's analysis is at times incomplete, 
in that he sees but alienation in all this.</p>

<p class="fst">In <u>Capital</u> &#8211; as opposed to Marx's early writings &#8211; it is not 
brought out that the worker is (and can only be) the positive vehicle of 
capitalist production, which is obliged to base itself on him as such, and to 
develop him as such, while simultaneously seeking to reduce him to an automaton 
and, at the limit, to drive him out of production altogether. Because of this, 
the analysis fails to perceive that the prime crisis of capitalism is the crisis 
in production, due to the simultaneous existence of two contradictory 
tendencies, neither of which could disappear without the whole system 
collapsing. Marx shows in capitalism "despotism in the workshop and anarchy in 
society" &#8211; instead of seeing it as both despotism and anarchy in both workshop 
and society. This leads him to look for the crisis of capitalism not in 
production itself (except insofar as capitalist production develops "oppression, 
misery, degeneration, but also revolt", and the numerical strength and 
discipline of the proletariat) &#8211; but in such factors as overproduction and the 
fall in the rate of profit. Marx fails to see that as long as this type of work 
persists, this crisis will persist with all it entails, and this whatever the 
system not only of property, but whatever the nature of the state, and finally 
whatever even the system of management of production.</p>

<p class="fst">In certain passages of <u>Capital</u>, Marx is thus led to see in 
modern production only the fact that the producer is mutilated and reduced to a 
"fragment of a man" &#8211; which is true, as much as the contrary<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> 
&#8211; and, what is 
more serious, to link this aspect to modern production and finally to production 
as such, instead of linking it to capitalist technology. Marx implies that the 
basis of this state of affairs is modern production as such, a stage in the 
development of technique about which nothing can be done, the famous "realm of 
necessity". Thus, the taking over of society by the producers &#8211; socialism &#8211; at 
times comes to mean, for Marx, only an external change in political and economic 
management, a change that would leave intact the structure of work and simply 
reform its more "inhuman" aspects. This idea is clearly expressed in the famous 
passage of "Volume III" of <u>Capital</u>, where speaking of socialist society, 
Marx says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In fact, the realm of freedom actually begins only where labor 
which is determined by necessity and mundane considerations ceases; thus, in the 
very nature of things, it lies beyond the sphere of actual material production. 
... Freedom in this field can only consist in socialized man, the associated 
producers, rationally regulating their interchange with Nature, bringing it 
under their common control, instead of being ruled by it ... and, achieving this 
with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most favorable to, and 
worthy of their human nature. But, it nonetheless still remains a realm of 
necessity. Beyond it begins ... the true realm of freedom, which however can 
blossom forth only with this realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of 
the working day is its basic prerequisite."<a href="#r12" name="rn12" target="_self">[12*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">If it is true that the "realm of freedom actually begins only 
where labor which is determined by necessity and mundane considerations ceases" 
it is strange to read from the pen of the man who wrote that "industry was the 
open book of human faculties" that freedom could "<u>thus</u>" only be found 
outside of work. The proper conclusion &#8211; which Marx himself draws in certain 
other places &#8211; is that the realm of freedom starts when work becomes <u>free 
activity</u>, both in what motivates it and in its content. In the dominant 
concept, however, freedom is what isn't work, it is what surrounds work, it is 
either "free time" (reduction of the working day) or "rational regulation" and 
"common control" of exchanges with Nature, which minimize human effort and 
preserve human dignity. In this perspective, the reduction of the working day 
certainly becomes a "basic prerequisite", as mankind would finally only be free 
in its leisure.</p>

<p class="fst">The reduction of the working day is, in fact, important, not for 
this reason however, but to allow people to achieve a balance between their 
various types of activity. And, at the limit, the "ideal" (communism) isn't the 
reduction of the working day to zero, but the free determination by all of the 
nature and extent of their work. Socialist society will be able to reduce the 
length of the working day, and will have to do so, but this will not be its 
fundamental preoccupation. Its first task will be to tackle "the realm of 
necessity", <u>as such</u>, to transform the very nature of work. The problem is 
not to leave more and more "free" time to individuals &#8211; which might well only be 
empty time &#8211; so that they may fill it at will with "poetry" or the carving of 
wood. The problem is to make of all time a time of liberty and to allow concrete 
freedom to find expression in creative activity.</p>

<p class="fst">The problem is to put poetry into work.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> Production isn't 
something negative, that has to be limited as much as possible for mankind to 
fulfill itself in its leisure. The institution of autonomy is also &#8211; and, in the 
first place &#8211; the institution of autonomy <u>in work</u>.</p>

<p class="fst">Underlying the idea that freedom is to be found "outside the 
realm of material production proper" there lies a double error. Firstly, that 
the very nature of technique and of modern production renders inevitable the 
domination of the productive process over the producer, in the course of his 
work. Secondly, that technology and in particular modern technology follows an 
autonomous development, before which one can only bow. This modern technology 
would, moreover, possess the double attribute of, on the one hand, constantly 
reducing the human role in production and, on the other hand, of constantly 
increasing the productivity of labor. From these two inexplicably combined 
attributes would result a miraculous dialectic of technological progress: more 
and more a slave <u>in the course</u> of work, man would be in a position 
enormously to reduce the <u>length</u> of work, if only s/he could organize 
society rationally.</p>

<p class="fst">We have already shown however that there is no autonomous 
development of technology. Of the sum total of technologies which scientific 
development makes possible at any given point in time, capitalist society brings 
to fulfillment those which correspond most closely to its class structure, which 
permit capital best to struggle against labor. It is generally believed that the 
application of this or that invention to production depends on its economic 
"profitability". But there is no such thing as a neutral "profitability": the 
class struggle in the factory is the main factor determining "profitability". A 
given invention will be preferred to another by a factory management if, other 
things being equal, it enhances the "independent" progress of production, 
freeing it from interference by the producers. The increasing enslavement of 
people in production flows essentially from <u>this</u> process, and not from 
some mysterious curse, inherent in a given phase of technological development. 
There is, moreover, no magic dialectic of slavery and productivity: productivity 
increases in relation to the enormous scientific and technical development which 
is at the basis of modern production &#8211; and it increases <u>despite</u> the 
slavery, and not because of it. Slavery implies an <u>enormous</u> waste, due to 
the fact that people only contribute an infinitesimal fraction of their 
capacities to production. (We are passing no <i>a priori</i> judgment on what 
these capacities might be. However low they may estimate it, the manager of 
Fords and the Secretary of the Russian Communist Party would have to admit that 
their own particular ways of organizing production only tapped an infinitesimal 
fraction of it).</p>

<p class="fst">Socialist society will therefore not be afflicted with any kind 
of technological curse. Having abolished bureaucratic capitalist relationships 
it will tackle at the same time the technological structure of production, which 
is both the basis of these relationships and their ever-renewed product.</p>

<h2><a name="h9">5. Workers' Management: The Factory</a></h2>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h10">a. Functions</a></h3>

<p class="fst">It is well known that workers can organize their own work at the 
level of a workshop or of part of a factory. Bourgeois industrial sociologists 
not only recognize this fact, but point out that "primary groups" of workers 
often get on with their job better if management leaves them alone, and doesn't 
constantly try to insert itself into the production process.</p>

<p class="fst">How can the work of these various "primary groups" &#8211; or of 
various shops and sections &#8211; be coordinated? Bourgeois theoreticians stress that 
the present managerial apparatus &#8211; whose formal job it is to ensure such a 
coordination &#8211; is not really up to the task: it has no real grip on the workers, 
and is, itself, torn by internal stresses. But having "demolished" the present 
set-up by their criticisms, modern industrial sociologists have nothing to put 
in its place. And, as beyond the "primary" organization of production, there has 
to be a "secondary" organization, they finally fall back on the existing 
bureaucratic apparatus, exhorting it "to understand", "to improve itself", "to 
trust people more", etc., etc.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> The same can be said of "reformed" or 
"de-Stalinized" leaders in the Eastern Bloc.</p>

<p class="fst">What no one seems prepared to recognize (or even to admit) is the 
capacity of working people to manage their own affairs outside of a very narrow 
radius. The bureaucratic mind cannot see in the mass of people employed in a 
factory or office an active subject, capable of managing and organizing. In the 
eyes of those in authority, both East and West, as soon as one gets beyond a 
group of ten, fifteen or twenty individuals, the crowd begins &#8211; the mob, the 
thousand-headed Hydra that can't act collectively, or that could only act 
collectively in the display of collective delirium or hysteria. They believe 
that only a specially evolved managerial apparatus, endowed, of course, with 
coercive functions, can dominate and control this mass.</p>

<p class="fst">But such are the muddles and shortcomings of the present 
managerial apparatus that even-today workers (or "primary groups") are obliged 
to take on quite a number of coordinating tasks. Moreover, historical experience 
shows that the working class is quite capable of managing whole enterprises. In 
Spain, in 1936 and 1937, workers ran the factories. In Budapest, in 1956, big 
bakeries employing hundreds of workers carried on during and immediately after 
the insurrection. They worked better than ever before, under workers' 
self-management. Many such examples could be quoted.</p>

<p class="fst">The most useful way of discussing this problem is not to weigh 
up, in the abstract, the "managerial capacities" of the working class. It is to 
disentangle the specific functions of the present managerial apparatus and to 
see which of them, under socialism, could be discarded, and which would need to 
be altered, and in what direction. Present managerial functions are of four main 
types and we will discuss them in turn:</p>

<h4>1. Coercive functions</h4>

<p class="indentb">These functions, and the jobs which go with them (supervisors, 
foremen, part of the "personnel" department), would be done away with, purely 
and simply. Each group of workers would be quite capable of disciplining itself. 
It would also be capable of granting momentary authority from time-to-time to 
people, drawn from its own ranks, should it feel this to be needed for the 
carrying out of a particular job.</p>

<h4>2. Administrative functions</h4>

<p class="indentb">These relate to jobs, most of which are now carried out in the 
offices. Among them are accountancy and the "commercial" and "general" services 
of the enterprise. The development of modern production has fragmented and 
socialized this work, just as it has done to production itself. Nine-tenths of 
people working in offices attached to factories carry out tasks of execution. 
Throughout their life, they will do little else. Important changes will have to 
be brought about here.</p>

<p class="indentb">The capitalist structure of the factory generally results in 
considerable over-staffing of these areas and a socialist reorganization would 
probably result in a big economy of labor in these fields. Some of these 
departments would not only diminish in size, but would witness a radical 
transformation of their functions. In the last few years "commercial sections" 
have everywhere grown enormously. In a planned socialist economy, they would be 
mainly concerned with, on the one hand, obtaining supplies, and on the other, 
with deliveries. They would be in contact with similar departments in 
supply-factories and with stores, distributing to consumers. Once the necessary 
transformations had been brought about, offices would be considered "workshops" 
like any others. They could organize their own work and would relate, for 
purposes of coordination, with the other shops of the factory. They would enjoy 
no particular rights by virtue of the nature of their work. They have, in fact, 
no such rights today, and it is as a result of other factors (the division 
between manual and "intellectual" work, the more pronounced hierarchy in 
offices, etc.), that persons from among the office staff may find their way 
into the ranks of management.</p>

<h4>3. "Technical" functions</h4>

<p class="indentb">These are, at present, carried out by people ranging from 
consultant engineers to draftsmen. Here, too, modern industry has created 
"collectives" in which work is divided up and socialized, and in which 90&nbsp;% of 
those involved do just as they're told. But, while pointing this out in relation 
to what goes on within these particular departments, we must recognize that 
these departments carry out managerial functions in relation to the production 
areas. Once production targets have been defined, it is this collective 
technical apparatus which selects ways and means, looks into the necessary 
changes in the tooling, determines the sequence and the details of various 
operations, etc. In theory, the production areas merely carry out the 
instructions issued from the technical departments. Under the conditions of 
modern mass production a complete separation certainly exists between those who 
draw up the plans and those who have to carry them out.</p>

<p class="indentb">Up to a point, all this is based on something real. Today, both 
specialization and technical and scientific competence are the privilege of a 
minority. But it doesn't follow in the least that the best way of using this 
expertise would be to leave to "experts" the right to decide the whole of 
production. Competence is, almost by definition, restricted in its scope. 
Outside of his/her particular sector, or of the particular process which s/he 
knows, the technician is no better equipped to take a responsible decision than 
anyone else. Even within his/her own field, his/her viewpoint is often limited. 
He/she will often know little of the other sectors and may tend to minimize 
their importance although these sectors have a definite bearing on his own. 
Moreover &#8211; and this is more important &#8211; the technician is separated from the 
real process of production.</p>

<p class="indentb">This separation is a source of waste and conflict in capitalist 
factories. It will only be abolished when "technical" and "productive" staff 
begin to cooperate in a thorough way. This cooperation will be based on joint 
decisions taken by the technicians and by those who will be working on a given 
task. Together, they will decide on the methods to be used.</p>

<p class="indentb">Will such cooperation work smoothly? There is no intrinsic reason 
why unsurmountable obstacles should arise. The workers will have no interest in 
challenging the answers which the technician, in his capacity as technician, may 
give to purely technical problems. And, if there are disagreements, these will 
rapidly be resolved in practice. The field of production allows of almost 
immediate verification of what this or that person proposes. That, for this or 
that job or tool, this or that type of metal would be preferable (given a 
certain state of knowledge and certain conditions of production) will seldom be 
a matter for controversy.</p>

<p class="indentb">But, the answers provided by technique only establish a general 
framework. They only suggest some of the elements which will, in practice, 
influence production. Within this given framework, there will probably be a 
number of ways of organizing a particular job. The choice will have to take into 
account on the one hand certain general considerations of "economy" (economy of 
labor, of energy, of raw materials, of plant) and on the other hand &#8211; and this 
is much more important &#8211; considerations relating to the fate of man in production. 
And on these questions, by definition, the only people who can decide are those 
directly involved. In this area, the specific competence of the technician, as a 
technician, is <i>nil</i>.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a></p>

<p class="indentb">The ultimate organization of production can, therefore, only be 
vested in the hands of the producers themselves. The producers will obviously 
take into account various technical points suggested by competent technicians. 
In fact, there will probably be a constant to-and-fro, if only because the 
producers themselves will envisage new ways of organizing the manufacture of 
products. These suggestions will pose new technical problems, about which the 
technicians will, in turn, have to put forward their comments and evaluations 
before a joint decision could be taken "in full knowledge of the relevant 
facts". But the decision &#8211; in this case as in others &#8211; will be in the hands of 
the producers (including the technicians) of a given shop (if it only affects a 
shop) &#8211; or of the factory as a whole (if it affects the whole factory).</p>

<p class="indentb">The roots of possible conflict between workers and technicians 
would therefore not be technical. If such a conflict emerged it would be a 
social conflict, arising from a possible tendency of the technicians to assume a 
dominating role, thereby constituting anew a bureaucratic managerial apparatus. 
What would be the strength and possible evolution of such a tendency?</p>

<p class="indentb">We can't here discuss this problem in any depth. We can only 
re-emphasize that technicians don't constitute a majority &#8211; or even an essential 
part &#8211; of the upper strata of modern economic or political management. 
Incidentally, to become aware of this obvious fact helps one see through the 
mystifying character of arguments which seek to prove that ordinary people 
cannot manage production because they lack the "necessary technical capacity". 
The vast majority of technicians only occupy subordinate positions. They only 
carry out a divided work, on instructions from above. Those technicians who have 
"reached the top" are not there as technicians, but as managers or organizers.</p>

<p class="indentb">Modern capitalism is <u>bureaucratic</u> capitalism. It isn't 
&#8211; 
and never will be &#8211; a <u>technocratic</u> capitalism. The concept of a 
technocracy is an empty generalization of superficial sociologists, or a daydream of technicians confronted with their own impotence and with the absurdity 
of the present system. Technicians don't constitute a class. From the formal 
point of view, they are just a category of wage-earners. The evolution of modern 
capitalism, by increasing their numbers and by transforming them into people who 
carry out fragmented and interchangeable work, tends to drive them closer to the 
working class. Counteracting these tendencies, it is true, are their position in 
the wages and status hierarchies &#8211; and also the scanty chances still open to 
them of "moving up".<a href="#r13" name="rn13" target="_self">[13*]</a> But these channels are gradually being closed as the 
numbers of technicians increase and as bureaucratization spreads within their 
own ranks. In parallel with all this, a revolt develops among them, as they 
confront the irrationalities of bureaucratic capitalism and experience 
increasing difficulties in giving free rein to their capacities for creative or 
meaningful work.</p>

<p class="indentb">Some technicians already at the top, or on their way there, will 
side squarely with exploiting society. They will, however, be opposed by a 
growing minority of disaffected colleagues, ready to work with others in 
overthrowing the system. In the middle, of course, there will be the great 
majority of technicians, today apathetically accepting their status of slightly 
privileged employees. Their present conservatism suggests that they would not 
risk a conflict with real power, whatever its nature. The evolution of events 
may even radicalize them.</p>

<p class="indentb">It is therefore most probable that workers' power in the factory, 
after having swept aside a small number of technical bureaucrats, will find 
support in a substantial number of other technicians. It should succeed, without 
major conflict, in integrating the remainder into the cooperative network of the 
factory.</p>

<h4>4. Truly managerial functions</h4>

<p class="indentb">The people "consulted" by a Company Chairman or Managing 
Director, before s/he takes an important decision, usually number less than a 
dozen, even in the most important firms. This very narrow stratum of management 
has two main tasks. On the one hand, it has to make decisions concerning 
investment, stocks, output, etc., in relation to market fluctuations and to 
long-term prospects. On the other hand, it has to "coordinate" the various 
departments of the firm, seeking to iron out differences between various 
segments of the bureaucratic apparatus.</p>

<p class="indentb">Some of these functions would disappear altogether in a planned 
economy, in particular, all those related to fluctuation of the market. Others 
would be considerably reduced: coordinating the different shops of a factory 
would be much easier if the producers organized their own work, and if different 
groups, shops, or departments could directly contact each other. Still other 
functions might be enhanced, such as genuine discussions of what might be 
possible in the future, or of how to do things, or about the present or future 
role of the enterprise in the overall development of the economy.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h11">b. Institutions</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Under socialism "managerial" tasks at <u>factory</u> level could 
be carried out by two bodies:</p>

<p class="indentb"><b>a.</b> <u>The Factory Council</u>, composed of delegates from 
the various shops and offices, all of them elected and instantly revocable. In 
an enterprise of say 5,000 to 10,000 workers such a Council might number 30-50 
people. The delegates would remain at their jobs. They would meet in full 
session as often as experience proved it necessary (probably on one or two 
half-days a week They would report back continuously to their workmates in shop 
or office &#8211; and would anyway probably have discussed all important matters with 
them previously. Rotating groups of delegates would ensure continuity. One of 
the main tasks of a Factory Council would be to ensure liaison and to act as a 
continuous regulating locus between the factory and the "outside world".</p>

<p class="indentb"><b>b.</b> <u>The General Assembly</u> of all those who work in 
the plant, whether manual workers, office workers or technicians. This would be 
the highest decision-making body for all problems concerning the factory as a 
whole. Differences between different sectors would be thrashed out at this 
level. This General Assembly would embody the restoration of direct democracy 
into what should, in modern society, be its basic unit: the place of work. The 
Assembly would have to ratify all but routine decisions of the Factory Council. 
It would be empowered to question, challenge, amend, reject or endorse any 
decision taken by the Council. The General Assembly will, itself, decide on all 
sorts of questions to be submitted to the Council. The Assembly would meet 
regularly &#8211; say, on one or two days each month. There would, in addition, exist 
procedures for calling such General Assemblies, if this was wanted by a given 
number of workers, or of shops, or of delegates.</p>

<p class="fst">For summaries of the composition and functions of these bodies, 
and of their relations with other basic units, see <a href="#b1">Basic Units 1</a>, <a href="#b2">Basic Units 2</a>,

<h2><a name="h12">6. The Content of Workers' Management at Factory Level</a></h2>

<p class="fst">It will help us to discuss this problem if we, rather 
schematically, differentiate between the static and the dynamic aspects of 
workers' management, between what will be immediately possible, at the very 
onset of socialist production, and what will become possible after a relatively 
short interval, as socialist production develops and as human domination over 
all stages of the productive process rapidly increases.</p>

<p class="fst">For the sake of clarity, we will first describe workers' 
management at factory level in a static way. We will then consider how it will 
develop, and how this development, itself, will constantly expand the areas of 
local freedom.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h13">a. Immediate Content</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Looked at in a static way, the overall plan might allocate to a 
given enterprise a target to be achieved within a given time (we will examine 
further on how such targets might be determined under conditions of genuinely 
democratic planning). The general means to be allocated to the enterprise (to 
achieve its target) would also be broadly outlined by the plan. For example, the 
plan might decide that the annual production of a given factory should be so 
many fridges, and that for this purpose such-and-such a quantity of raw 
materials, power, machinery, etc., should be made available.</p>

<p class="fst">Seen from this angle, workers' management implies that the 
workers' collective will itself be responsible for deciding <u>how</u> a 
proposed target could best be achieved, given the general means available. The 
task corresponds to the "positive" functions of the present narrowly-based 
managerial apparatus, which will have been superseded. The workers will 
determine the organization of their work in each shop or department. They will 
ensure coordination between shops. This will take place through direct contacts 
whenever it is a question of routine problems or of shops engaged in closely 
related aspects of the productive process. If more important matters arose, they 
would be discussed and solved by meetings of delegates (or by joint gatherings 
of workers) of two or more shops or sections. The overall coordination of the 
work would be undertaken by the Factory Council and by the General Assembly of 
the Factory. Relations with the rest of the economy, as already stated, would be 
in the hands of the Factory Council.</p>

<p class="fst">As the whole thing becomes real in the hands of the workers of a 
given plant, a certain "give and take" will undoubtedly occur between "targets 
set" and "means to be used". It must be remembered, however, that these "means" 
are usually the product of some other factory. "Targets set" and "means of 
production available for achieving them" do not, however, between them rigidly 
or exhaustively define all the possible methods that could be used. Spelling 
these methods out in detail, and deciding exactly how an objective will be 
achieved, given certain material conditions, will be the area in which workers' 
management will first operate. It is an important field, but a <u>limited</u> 
one, and it is essential to be fully aware of its limitations. These limitations 
stem from (and define) the framework in which the new type of production will 
have to start. It will be the task of socialist production constantly to expand 
this framework and constantly to push back these limitations on autonomy.</p>

<p class="fst">Autonomy, envisaged in this static way, is limited, first of all, 
in relation to the fixing of targets. True, the workers of a given enterprise 
will participate in determining the target of their factory insofar as they 
participate in the elaboration of the overall plan. But, they are not in total 
or sole control of the objectives. In a modern economy, where the production of 
most enterprises both conditions and is conditioned by that of others, the 
determination of coherent targets cannot as a rule be vested in individual 
enterprises, acting in isolation. It must be undertaken by (and for) a number of 
enterprises, general viewpoints prevailing over particular ones. We will return 
to this point later.</p>

<p class="fst">Initial autonomy will also be limited in relation to available 
material means. The workers of a given enterprise cannot autonomously determine 
the means of production they would prefer to use, for these are but the products 
of other enterprises or factories. Total autonomy for every factory, in relation 
to means, would imply that each factory could determine the output of all the 
others. These various autonomies would immediately neutralize one another. This 
limitation is, however, a less rigid one than the first (the limitation in 
relation to targets). Alterations of its own equipment, proposed by the 
user-factory, might often be accommodated by the producer-factory, without the 
latter saddling itself with a heavy extra load. On a small scale, this happens 
even today, in integrated engineering factories (car factories, for instance) 
where a substantial part of the tooling utilized in one shop may be made in 
another shop of the same factory. Close cooperation between plants making 
machine tools and plants using them, could quickly lead to considerable changes 
in the means of production actually used.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h14">b. Subsequent Possibilities</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Let us now look at workers' management at factory level as it 
might develop, i.e., in its dynamic aspect. How would it contribute to 
transforming socialist production, i.e., to its <u>primary</u> <u>objective</u>? 
Everything we have suggested so far, will now have to be looked at again. The 
limits of autonomy will be found to have widened very considerably.</p>

<p class="fst">The change will be most obvious in relation to the means of 
production. Socialist society will immediately get to grips with the problem of 
a conscious attack on the technology inherited from capitalism. Under 
capitalism, the means of production are planned and made independently of the 
user and of his/her preferences (manufacturers, of course, pretend to take the 
user's viewpoint into account, but this has little to do with the real user: the 
worker on the shop floor). But, equipment is made to be productively used. The 
viewpoint of the "productive consumers" (i.e., of those who will <u>use</u> the 
equipment to <u>produce</u> the goods) is of primary importance. As the views of 
those who <u>make</u> the equipment are also important, the problem of the 
structure of the means of production will only be solved by the living 
cooperation of these two categories of workers. In an integrated factory, this 
would mean permanent liaison between the corresponding shops. At the level of 
the economy, as a whole, it would take place through <u>normal</u> permanent 
contacts between factories and between sectors of production.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This cooperation will take two forms. Choosing and popularizing 
the best methods, and rationalizing and extending their use, will be achieved 
through <u>the horizontal cooperation of Councils</u>, <u>organized according to 
branch or sector of industry</u> (for instance, textiles, the chemical industry, 
building, engineering, electrical supply, etc.). On the other hand, the 
integration of the viewpoints of those who make, and of those who utilize, 
equipment (or, more generally, of those who make and those who utilize 
intermediate products) will require <u>the vertical cooperation of Councils 
representing the different stages of a productive process</u> (steel industry, 
machine tool industry and engineering industry, for instance). In both cases, 
the cooperation will need to find embodiment in stable forms, such as Committees 
of Factory Council representatives (or wider conferences of producers) organized 
both horizontally and vertically. There would be room for extreme flexibility 
and many new forms will almost certainly evolve.</p>

<p class="fst">Considering the problem from this dynamic angle &#8211; which, in the 
last resort, is the really fundamental one &#8211; one can see, at once, that the 
areas of autonomy have considerably expanded. Already at the level of individual 
factories (but more significantly at the level of cooperation between 
factories), the producers are beginning to influence the structure of the means 
of production. They are, thereby, reaching a position where they are beginning 
to dominate the work process: they are not only determining its methods, but are 
now also modifying its technological structure.</p>

<p class="fst">This fact now begins to alter what we have just said about 
targets. Three-quarters of modern production consists of intermediate products, 
of "means of production" in the widest sense. When producers decide about the 
means of production, they are participating, in a very direct and immediate way, 
in decisions about the targets of production. The remaining limitation, and it 
is an important one, flows from the fact that these means of production 
(whatever their exact nature) are destined, in the last analysis, to produce 
consumer goods. And the overall volume of these can only be determined, in 
general terms, by the plan.</p>

<p class="fst">But, even here, looking at things dynamically, radically alters 
one's vision. Modern consumption is characterized by the constant appearance of 
new products. Factories producing consumer goods will conceive of, receive 
suggestions about, study, and finally produce such products. This raises the 
wider problem of contact between producers and consumers. Capitalist society 
rests on a complete separation of these two aspects of human activity, and on 
the exploitation of the consumer. This isn't just monetary exploitation (through 
overcharging). Capitalism claims that it can satisfy people's needs better than 
any other system in history. But, in fact, capitalism influences both these 
needs themselves, and the method of satisfying them. Consumer preference can be 
manipulated by modern sales techniques.</p>

<p class="fst">The division between producers and consumers appears most 
glaringly in relation to the <u>quality</u> of goods. This problem is insoluble 
in any exploiting society. Those who only look at the surface of things only see 
a commodity as a commodity. They don't see in it a crystallized moment of the 
class struggle. They see faults or defects as just faults or defects, instead of 
seeing in them the resultant of a constant struggle between the worker and 
himself ("Could I do it better? Why should I? I'm just paid to get on with the 
job"). Faults or defects embody struggles between the worker and exploitation. 
They also embody squabbles between different sections of the bureaucracy 
managing the plant. The elimination of exploitation will of itself bring about a 
change in all this. At work, people will begin to assert their claims as future 
consumers of what they are producing. In its early phases socialist society 
will, however, probably have to institute forms of contact (other than "the 
market") between producers and consumers.</p>

<p class="fst">We have assumed, as a starting point for all this, the division 
of labor inherited from capitalism. But, we have also said that socialist 
society would, from the very beginning, have to tackle this division. This is an 
enormous subject that we can't even begin to deal with in this text. The basis 
of this task can, however, be seen even today. Modern production has destroyed 
many traditional professional qualifications. It has created many automatic or 
semi-automatic machines. It has, thereby itself, subverted the traditional 
framework of the industrial division of labor. It is tending to produce a 
universal worker, capable after a relatively short apprenticeship, of using most 
of the existing machines. Once one gets beyond its class aspects, the "posting" 
of workers to particular jobs in a big modern factory corresponds less and less 
to a genuine division of labor and more and more to a simple division of tasks. 
Workers are not allocated to given areas of the productive process because their 
"professional skills" invariably correspond to "skills required" by management. 
They are often placed here rather than there because putting a particular worker 
in a particular place at a particular time happens to suit the personnel officer 
&#8211; or the foreman &#8211; or, more prosaically, just because a particular vacancy 
happened to be going.</p>

<p class="fst">Under socialism, factories would have no reason to accept the 
rigid division of labor now prevailing. There will be every reason to encourage 
a rotation of workers <u>between shops and departments</u> &#8211; and, between 
production and office areas. Such a rotation will greatly help workers to manage 
production "in full knowledge of the relevant facts". [More and more workers 
will have become familiar at first hand with what goes on where they work.] The 
same applies to rotation of work <u>between various enterprises</u>, and in 
particular, between "producing" and "utilizing" units.</p>

<p class="fst">The residues of capitalism's division of labor will have 
gradually to be eliminated. This overlaps with the general problem of education, 
education not only of the new generations, but of those adults brought up under 
the previous system. We can't go into this problem here.</p>

<h2><a name="h15">7. General Problems of Socialist Economy</a></h2>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h16">a. Simplification and Rationalization of Data</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Socialist economy implies that the producers themselves will 
consciously manage all economic activity. This management will be exercised at 
all levels, and, in particular, at the overall or central level. It is illusory 
to believe that bureaucracies (even "controlled" bureaucracies) left to 
themselves could guide the economy towards socialism. Such bureaucracies could 
only lead society towards new forms of exploitation. It is also wrong to think 
that "automatic" objective mechanisms could be established, which, like the 
automatic pilots of a modern jet aircraft, could at each moment direct the 
economy in the desired direction. The same impossibilities arise whether one 
considers an "enlightened" bureaucracy or some electronic super-computer, namely 
that the key problems are human ones. Any plan pre-supposes a fundamental 
decision on the rate of growth of the economy, and this, in turn, depends 
essentially on human decisions concerning the distribution of the social product 
between investment and consumption.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">No "objective" rationality can determine such a distribution. A 
decision to invest 10&nbsp;% of the social product is neither more nor less rational 
than a decision to invest 90&nbsp;% of it. The only rationality in the matter is the 
choice people make about their own fate, in full knowledge of the relevant 
facts. The fixing of plan targets by those who will have to fulfill them is, in 
the last analysis, the only guarantee of their willing and spontaneous 
participation.</p>

<p class="fst">But this doesn't mean that the plan and the management of the 
economy are "just political matters". Socialist planning will base itself on 
certain rational technical factors. It is, in fact, the only type of planning 
which could integrate such factors into a conscious management of the economy. 
These factors consist of a number of extremely useful and effective 
"labor-saving" and "thought-saving" devices, which can be used to simplify the 
representation of the economy and of its interrelations, thereby allowing the 
problems of central economic management to be made accessible to all. Workers' 
management of production (this time at the level of the economy as a whole, and 
not just at the level of a particular factory) will only be possible if the 
fundamental decisions have been enormously simplified, so that the producers and 
their collective institutions are in a position to judge the key issues in an 
informed way. What is needed in other words, is for the vast current chaos of 
economic facts and relations to be boiled down to certain propositions, which 
adequately sum up the real problems and choices. These propositions should be 
few in number. They should be easy to grasp. They should summarize reality 
without distortion or mystification. If they can do this, they will form an 
adequate basis for meaningful judgments.</p>

<p class="fst">A condensation of such a type is possible, firstly, because there 
<u>are</u> rational ingredients to the economy, and secondly, because there exist 
already today certain techniques allowing one to grasp the complexities of 
economic reality, and finally because it <u>is</u> now possible to mechanize and 
to automate all that does not pertain to human decisions in the strict sense.</p>

<p class="fst">A discussion of the relevant devices, techniques, and 
possibilities is therefore essential as from now. They enable us to carry out a 
vast clearing of the ground, without which workers' management would collapse 
under the weight of the very subject matter it sought to deal with. Such a 
discussion is in no sense a "purely technical" discussion and at each stage of 
it we will be guided by the general principles already outlined.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h17">b. The "Plan Factory"</a></h3>

<p class="fst">A plan of production, whether it deals with one factory or with 
the economy as a whole, resembles a reasoning. It can be boiled down to two 
premises and to one conclusion. The two premises are the material means one 
disposes of at the onset (equipment, stocks, labor, etc.), and the target one is 
aiming at (production of so many specified objects, to be brought about within 
this or that period of time), We will refer to these premises as the "<u>initial 
conditions</u>" and the "<u>ultimate targets</u>". The "conclusion" is the path 
to be followed to pass from initial conditions to ultimate target. In practice, 
this means a certain number of intermediate products to be made within a given 
period. We will call these conclusions the "<u>intermediate targets</u>".</p>

<p class="fst">When passing from simple initial conditions to a simple ultimate 
target, the intermediate targets can be determined quickly. As the initial 
conditions or the ultimate target (or both) become more complex, or are more 
spread out in time, the establishment of intermediate targets becomes more 
difficult. In the case of the economy as a whole (where there are thousands of 
different products, several of which can be made by different processes, and 
where the manufacture of any given category of products often directly or 
indirectly involves many others), one might imagine the complexity to be such 
that rational planning (in the sense of an <i>a priori</i> determination of the 
intermediate targets, given the initial conditions and ultimate target), would 
be impossible. The apologists of "private enterprise" have been proclaiming this 
doctrine for ages. But, it isn't true.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> The problem <u>can</u> be solved, and 
available mathematical techniques in fact allow it to be solved remarkably 
simply. Once the "initial conditions" are known and the "ultimate targets" have 
been consciously and democratically determined, the whole content of planning 
(the determination of the intermediate targets) can be reduced to a purely 
technical task of execution, capable of being mechanized and automated to a very 
high degree.</p>

<p class="fst">The basis of the new methods is the concept of the total 
interdependence of all sectors of the economy (the fact that everything that one 
sector utilizes in production is itself the product of one or more other 
sectors; and the converse fact, that every product of a given sector will 
ultimately be utilized or consumed by one or more other sectors). The idea, 
which goes back to Quesnay and which formed the basis of Marx's <i>theory of 
accumulation</i>, has been vastly developed in the last few years by a group of 
American economists around Wassily W. Leontief, who have succeeded in giving it 
a statistical formulation.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> The interdependence is such that, at any given 
moment (for a given level of technique and a given structure of available 
equipment), the production of each sector is related, in a relatively stable 
manner, to the products of other sectors which the first sector utilizes 
("consumes productively").</p>

<p class="fst">It is easy to grasp that a given quantity of coal is needed to 
produce a ton of steel of a given type. Moreover, one will need so much scrap 
metal or so much iron ore, so many hours of labor, such-and-such an expenditure 
on upkeep and repairs. The ratio "coal used : steel produced", expressed in 
terms of value, is known as the "current technical coefficient" determining the 
productive consumption of coal per unit of steel turned out. If one wants to 
increase steel production beyond a certain point, it won't help just to go on 
delivering more coal or more scrap metal to the existing steel mills. New mills 
will have to be built. Or, one will have to increase the productive capacity of 
existing mills. To increase steel output by a given amount, one will have to 
produce a given amount of specified equipment. The ratio "given amount of 
specified equipment : steel-producing capacity per given period", again 
expressed in terms of value, is known as the "technical coefficient of capital". 
It determines the quantity of capital utilized per unit of steel produced in a 
given period.</p>

<p class="fst">One could stop at this point, if one were only dealing with a 
single enterprise. Every firm bases itself on calculations of this kind (in 
fact, on much more detailed ones) when, having decided to produce so much, or to 
increase its production by so much, it buys raw materials, orders machinery or 
recruits labor. But when one looks at the economy as a whole things change. The 
interdependence of the various sectors has definite consequences. The 
<u>increase</u> of production of a given sector has repercussions (of varying 
intensity) on all other sectors and finally on the initial sector itself. For 
example, an increase in the production of steel immediately requires an increase 
in the production of coal. But this requires both an increase in certain types 
of mining equipment and the recruitment of more labor into mining. The increased 
demand for mining equipment, in turn, requires <u>more</u> steel, and more labor 
in the steel mills. This, in turn, leads to a demand for still more coal, etc., 
etc.</p>

<p class="fst">The use of Wassily W. Leontief's matrices, combined with other 
modern methods such as Koopmans' "activity analysis"<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> (of which "operational 
research" is a specific instance) would, in the case of a socialist planned 
economy, allow theoretically exact answers to be given to questions of this 
type. A matrix is a table on which are systematically disposed the technical coefficients (both "current technical coefficients" and "technical coefficients of 
capital") expressing the dependence of each sector on each of the others. Every 
ultimate target that might be chosen is presented as a list of material means to 
be utilized (and therefore, manufactured) in specified amounts, within the 
period in question. As soon as the ultimate target is chosen, the solution of a 
system of simultaneous equations enables one to define immediately all the 
intermediate targets, and therefore, the tasks to be fulfilled by each sector of 
the economy.</p>

<p class="fst">The working-out of these relationships will be the task of a 
highly mechanized and automated specific enterprise, whose main work would 
consist in the mass production of various plans (targets) and of their various 
components (implications). This enterprise is the plan factory. Its central 
workshop would, to start with, probably consist of a computer whose "memory" 
would store the technical coefficients and the initial productive capacity of 
each sector. If "fed" a number of hypothetical targets, the computer could spell 
out the productive implication of each target for each sector (including the 
amount of work to be provided, in each instance, by the "man-power" sector).<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Around this central workshop, there would be others whose tasks 
would be to study the distribution and variations of regional production and 
investment and possible technical optima (given the general interdependence of 
the various sectors). They would also determine the unit-values (equivalences) 
of different categories of product. Two departments of the plan factory warrant 
special mention: that dealing with stock-taking and that dealing with the 
technical coefficients.</p>

<p class="fst">The quality of planning, conceived in this way, depends on how 
well people are informed of the <u>real</u> state of the economy which forms its 
basis. The accuracy of the solution, in other words, depends on adequate 
information about both "initial conditions" and the "technical coefficients". 
Industrial and agricultural censuses are carried out at regular intervals even 
today, by a number of advanced capitalist countries: they offer a very crude 
basis, because they are extremely inaccurate and fragmented. The drawing up of 
an up-to-date and complete inventory will be one of the first tasks of a 
self-managed society. The collective preparation of such an inventory is a 
serious task. It can't be achieved "from above", from one day to the next. Nor, 
once drawn up, would such an inventory be considered final. Perfecting it and 
keeping it up-to-date would be a permanent task of the plan factory, working in 
close cooperation with those sections of the local Councils responsible for 
industrial stocktaking in their own areas. The results of this cooperation would 
constantly modify and "enrich" the "memory" of the central computer.</p>

<p class="fst">Establishing the "technical coefficients" will pose similar 
problems. To start with, it could be done very roughly, using certain generally 
available statistical information ("on average, the textile industry uses so 
much cotton to produce so much cloth"). But, such knowledge will have to be made 
far more precise through technical information provided by the Councils of 
particular industries. The data "stores" in the computer will have to be 
periodically revised as more accurate knowledge about the technical coefficients 
&#8211; and in particular, about the real changes in these coefficients brought about 
by new technological developments &#8211; is brought to light.</p>

<p class="fst">Knowledge of the real state of affairs, combined with the 
constant revision of basic data and with the possibility of drawing instant 
conclusions from them, will result in very considerable, possibly enormous, 
gains. The potentialities of these new techniques remain untapped, in the very 
field where they could be most usefully applied: that of the economy taken as a 
whole. Any technical modification, in any sector, could in theory affect the 
work load and the conditions of a rational choice of methods in all other 
sectors. A socialist economy would be able totally and instantaneously to take 
advantage of such facts. Capitalist economies only take them into account 
belatedly and in a very partial way.</p>

<p class="fst">The setting-up of such a plan factory should be immediately 
possible, in any country which is even moderately industrialized. The equipment 
necessary exists already. So do the people capable of working it. Banks and 
insurance companies (which will be unnecessary under socialism) already use some 
of these methods in work of this general type. Linking up with mathematicians, 
statisticians, econometricians, those who work in such offices could provide the 
initial personnel of the plan factory. Workers' management of production and the 
requirements of a rational economy will provide a tremendous impetus to the 
development, both "spontaneous" and "conscious" of rational techniques of 
planning.</p>

<p class="fst"><u>Let us not be misunderstood</u>; <u>the role of the "plan 
factory" won't be to decide on the plan</u>. It won't impose anything on others. 
The <u>targets</u> of the plan will be determined by society as a whole, in a 
manner shortly to be described. <u>Before</u> any proposals are voted upon, 
however, the plan factory will work out and present to society as a whole the 
implications and consequences (for various groups of the population) of the plan 
(or plans) suggested. This will result in a vast increase in the area of real 
democracy (i.e., of deciding <u>in full knowledge of the relevant facts</u>). 
After a plan has been adopted, the task of the plan factory will be to 
constantly <u>bring up-to-date</u> the facts on which the plan was based, to 
draw the necessary conclusions from possibilities of change and to inform both 
the Central Assembly of Councils and the relevant sectors of any alterations in 
intermediate targets (and therefore, of production tasks) that might be worth 
considering.</p>

<p class="fst">In none of these instances would those actually working in the 
plan factory decide or impose anything &#8211; except the organization of their own 
work.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h18">c. Consumer Goods</a></h3>

<p class="fst">But what about consumption? In a socialist society, how could 
people determine what is produced?</p>

<p class="fst">It is obvious that this cannot be based on direct democracy. The 
plan can't propose, as an ultimate target, a complete list of consumer goods or 
suggest in what proportions they should be produced. Such a proposal would not 
be democratic, for two reasons. Firstly, it could never be based on "full 
knowledge of the relevant facts", namely on a full knowledge of everybody's 
preferences. Secondly, it would be tantamount to a pointless tyranny of the 
majority over the minority. If 40&nbsp;% of the population wish to consume a certain 
article, there is no reason why they should be deprived of it under pretext that 
the other 60&nbsp;% prefer something else. No preference or taste is more logical than 
any other. Moreover, consumer wishes are seldom incompatible with one another. 
Majority votes in this matter would amount to rationing, an absurd way of 
settling this kind of problem anywhere but in a besieged fortress.</p>

<p class="fst">Planning decisions won't therefore relate to particular items, 
but to the general standard of living (the overall volume of consumption). They 
will not delve into the detailed composition of this consumption.</p>

<p class="fst">In relation to human consumption, deciding on living standards 
doesn't require the same kind of considerations that go into determining how 
many tons of coal are needed to produce so many tons of steel. There are no 
"technical coefficients of the consumer". Under capitalism, there is, of course, 
some statistical correlation between income and the structure of demand (without 
such a correlation private capitalism couldn't function). But, this is only a 
very relative affair. It would be turned upside down under socialism. A massive 
redistribution of incomes will have taken place; profound changes will have 
occurred in every realm of social life; the permanent rape of the consumers 
through advertising and capitalist sales' techniques will have been abolished; 
new tastes will have emerged as the result of increased leisure.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, the statistical regularity of consumer demand can't 
solve the problem of <u>variations</u> that might occur within a given period, 
between real demand and that envisaged in the plan. Genuine planning doesn't 
mean saying "living standards will go up by 5&nbsp;% next year, and experience tells 
us that this will result in a 20&nbsp;% increase in the demand for cars, therefore 
let's make 20&nbsp;% more cars", and stopping at that. One may have to start in this 
way, where other criteria are missing, but there will have to be powerful 
correcting mechanisms capable of responding to disparities between anticipated 
and real demand.</p>

<p class="fst">Socialist society will have to regulate the pattern of its 
consumption according to the principle of <u>consumer sovereignty</u>. This 
implies the existence of some mechanism whereby consumer demand can genuinely 
make itself felt. The "general decision" embodied in the plan will define:</p>

<p class="indentb">a. what proportion of its overall product society wishes to 
devote to the satisfaction of individual consumer needs,</p>

<p class="indentb">b. what proportion it would like to allocate to collective needs 
("public consumption"), and</p>

<p class="indentb">c. what proportion it wants to devote to "developing the 
productive forces" (i.e., to invest). But the <u>structure</u> of consumption 
will have to be determined by the individual consumers themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">How could a mutual adaptation of supply and demand come about? 
How might consumer demand really manifest itself?</p>

<p class="fst">First there would have to be an overall equilibrium. The sum 
total distributed in any given period (as "wages" and other benefits) would have 
to be equal to the value of consumer goods (quantities x prices) made available 
in that period. An "empirical" initial decision would then have to be taken, to 
provide, at least, a skeleton for the structure of consumption. This initial 
decision would base itself on traditionally "known" statistical data, but in 
full knowledge of the fact that these will have to be extensively modified by 
taking into account a whole series of new factors (such as the equalization of 
wages, for instance). Stocks of various commodities, in excess of what it is 
expected might be consumed in a given period will, initially, have to be 
scheduled for.</p>

<p class="fst">Three "corrective" processes would then come into play, the net 
result of which would be to immediately demonstrate any gap between anticipated 
and real demand, and to bridge it:</p>

<p class="indentb">a. Available stocks would either rise or fall.</p>

<p class="indentb">b. According to whether the reserve stocks decreased or increased 
(i.e., according to whether demand had been initially underestimated or 
overestimated), there would be an initial rise or fall in the price of the 
various commodities. The reason for these temporary price fluctuations would 
have to be fully explained to the people.</p>

<p class="indentb">c. There would simultaneously take place an immediate 
readjustment in the output of consumer goods, to the level where (the stocks 
having been reconstituted) the production of goods equals the demand. At that 
moment, the sale price would again become equal to the "normal price" (labor 
value) of the product.</p>

<p class="fst"><u>Given the principle of "consumer sovereignty" any differences 
between the actual demand and production scheduled will have to be corrected by 
a modification in the structure of production and not by resorting to permanent 
differences between selling prices and value</u>. If such differences were to 
appear, they would automatically imply that the original planning decision was 
wrong, in this particular field.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h19">d. "Money", "Wages", Value</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Many absurdities have been said about money and its immediate 
abolition in a socialist society, and there is a great deal of loose thinking 
about the subject.<a href="#r14" name="rn14" target="_self">[14*]</a> It should be clear that the role of money is radically 
altered from the moment where it can no longer be a means of <u>accumulation</u> 
(the means of production being owned in common) or as a means of <u>exerting 
social pressure</u> (wages being equal). What residual function would money then 
have?</p>

<p class="fst">People will probably receive a <u>token</u> in return for what 
they put into society.<a href="#r15" name="rn15" target="_self">[15*]</a> These "tokens" might take the form of units, 
allowing people to organize what they take out of society, spreading it out (a) 
in time, and (b) between different objects and services, exactly as they wish. 
As we are seeking here to get to grips with realities and are not fighting 
against words, we see no objection to calling these tokens "wages" and these 
units "money",<a href="#r16" name="rn16" target="_self">[16*]</a> just as a little earlier we used the words "normal prices" 
to describe the monetary expression of labor value.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Under socialism labor value would be the only rational basis for 
any kind of social accountancy and the only yardstick having any real meaning 
for people. The first aim of socialist production will be to reduce both the 
direct and indirect expenditure of human labor power. Fixing the prices of 
consumer goods on the basis of their labor value, would mean that for everyone 
the cost of objects would clearly appear as the equivalent of the labor (in 
hours) s/he himself would have had to expend to produce them (assuming s/he had 
access to the average prevailing equipment and that s/he had an average social 
capacity).</p>

<p class="fst">It would both simplify and clarify things if the monetary unit 
was considered the "net product of an hour of labor" and if this were made the 
unit of value. It would also assist total demystification if the hourly wage, 
equal for all, were a given fraction of this unit, expressing the ratio "private 
consumption : total net production".</p>

<p class="fst">If these steps were taken and thoroughly explained, they would 
enable the fundamental planning decisions (namely the distribution of the social 
product between consumption and investment) to be immediately obvious to 
everyone, and repeatedly drawn to their attention, every time s/he bought 
anything. Equally obvious would be the social cost of every object acquired.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h20">e. Wage Equality</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Working class aspirations, whenever they succeed in expressing 
themselves independently of the trade union bureaucracy, are often directed 
against hierarchy and wage differentials. Basing itself on this fact, socialist 
society will introduce absolute wage equality.</p>

<p class="fst">There is no justification for wage differentials, whether these 
reflect differing professional qualifications or differences in productivity. If 
an individual himself/herself advanced the costs of his/her professional 
training, and if society considered him/her "an enterprise", the recuperation of 
those costs, spread out over a working lifetime would at most "justify", at the 
extremes of the wages spectrum a differential of 2:1 (between a sweeper and a 
neurosurgeon). Under socialism, training costs would be advanced by society 
(they often are, even today), and the question of their "recovery" would not 
arise. As for productivity, it depends (already today) much less on bonus and 
much more on the coercions exercised on the one hand by the machines and by the 
foreman (tending to push it up), and on the other hand by the disciplined 
resistance to production, imposed by primary working groups in the workshop 
(tending to keep it down). Socialist society could not increase productivity by 
economic constraints without resorting again to all the capitalist paraphernalia 
of norms, supervision, etc. Cooperation would flow (as it already does, in part, 
today) from the self-organization of primary groups in the workshops, from the 
natural relationships between different shops, and from gatherings of producers 
in different factories or different sectors of the economy. The primary group in 
a workshop, can, in general, secure that any particular individual does his/her 
share. If, for any particular reason, they couldn't work with a particular 
person, they could ask him/her to leave the particular shop. It would then be 
up to the individual in question to seek entry into one of many other primary 
groups of workers and to get himself/herself accepted by them.</p>

<p class="fst">Wage equality will give a real meaning to consumption, every 
individual at last being assured of an equal vote. It will abolish a large 
number of conflicts both in everyday life and in production, and will enable an 
extraordinary cohesion of working people to develop. It will destroy at the very 
roots the whole mercantile monstrosity of capitalism (both private and 
bureaucratic), the commercialization of individuals, that whole universe where 
one doesn't earn what one is worth, but where one is worth what one earns. A few 
years of wage equality and little will be left of the whole distorted mentality 
of present day individuals.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h21">f. The Fundamental Decision</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The fundamental decision, in a socialist economy, is the one 
whereby society as a whole determines what it wants (i.e., the ultimate targets 
of its plan). This decision is about two basic propositions. Given certain 
"initial conditions", how much time does society want to devote to production? 
And how much of the total product does it want to see respectively allocated to 
private consumption, to public consumption, and to investment?</p>

<p class="fst">In both private and bureaucratic capitalist societies, the amount 
of time one has to work is determined by the ruling class by means of economic 
or direct physical constraints. No one is consulted about the matter. Socialist 
society, taken as a whole, will not escape the impact of certain economic facts 
(in the sense that any decision to modify labor time will &#8211; other things being 
equal &#8211; have a bearing on production). But, it will differ from all previous 
societies, in that for the first time in history, people will be able to decide 
about work in full knowledge of the relevant facts, with the basic elements of 
the problem clearly presented to them.</p>

<p class="fst">Socialism will also be the first social system enabling people to 
decide in a rational way about how society's product should be divided between 
consumption and investment. Under private capitalism, this distribution takes 
place in an absolutely arbitrary manner and one would seek in vain any 
"rationality" underlying what determines investment.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> In bureaucratic 
capitalist societies, the volume of investment is also decided upon quite 
arbitrarily. The central bureaucracy, in these societies, have never been able 
to justify their choices except through recourse to incantations about the 
"priority of heavy industry".<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> But, even if there were a rational, 
"objective" basis for a central decision, such a decision would automatically be 
irrational, if it was reached in the absence of those primarily concerned, 
namely the members of society. Any decision taken in this way would reproduce 
the basic contradiction of all exploiting regimes. It would treat people, in the 
plan, as components of predictable behavior, as theoretical "objects". It would 
soon lead to treating them as objects in real life, too. Such a policy would 
contain the seeds of its own failure: instead of encouraging the participation 
of the producers in carrying out the plan, it would irrevocably alienate them 
from a plan that was not of their choosing. There is no objective "rationality" 
allowing one to decide, by means of mathematical formulae, about the future of 
society, about work, about consumption, and about accumulation. The only 
rationality in these realms is the living reason of mankind, the decisions of 
ordinary men and women concerning their own fate.</p>

<p class="fst">But, these decisions won't flow from a toss of the dice. They 
will be based on a complete clarification of the problem and on full knowledge 
of the relevant facts. This will be possible because there exists, for any given 
level of technique, a definite relation between a given investment and the 
resulting increase in production. This relation is nothing other than the 
application to the economy as a whole of the "technical coefficients of capital" 
of which we spoke earlier. Such-and-such an investment in steelworks will result 
in such-and-such an increase in what the steelworks turn out &#8211; and such-and-such 
a global investment in production will result in such-and-such a net increase in 
the global social product.<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> Therefore, such-and-such a rate of accumulation 
will allow such-and-such a rate of increase of the social product (and 
therefore, of the standard of living or amount of leisure). Finally, 
such-and-such a fraction of the product devoted to accumulation will also result 
in such-and-such a rate of increase of living standards.</p>

<p class="fst">The overall problem can therefore be posed in the following 
terms. Such-and-such an immediate increase in consumption is possible &#8211; but it 
would imply a significant cut-down on further increases in the years to come. On 
the other hand, people might prefer to choose a more limited immediate increase 
in living standards, which would allow the social product (and hence, living 
standards) to increase at the rate of x&nbsp;% per annum in the years to come. And, so 
on. "The conflict between the present and the future", to which the apologists 
of private capitalism and of the bureaucracy are constantly referring, would 
still be with us. But, it would be clearly seen. And, society itself would 
settle the matter, fully aware of the setting and of the implications of what it 
was doing.</p>

<p class="fst">In conclusion, and to sum up, one could say that any overall plan 
submitted to the people for discussion would have to specify:</p>

<p class="indentb">a. the productive implications for each sector of industry, and 
as far as possible for each enterprise;</p>

<p class="indentb">b. the amount of work for everyone that these implied;</p>

<p class="indentb">c. the level of consumption during the initial period;</p>

<p class="indentb">d. the amounts to be devoted to public consumption and to 
investment;</p>

<p class="indentb">e. the rate of increase of future consumption.</p>

<p class="fst">To simplify things, we have at times presented the decisions 
about ultimate and intermediate targets (i.e., the implications of the plan 
concerning specific areas of production) as two separate and consecutive acts. 
In practice, there would be a continuous give-and-take between these two phases, 
and a multiplicity of proposals. The producers will be in no position to decide 
on ultimate targets, unless they know what the implications of particular 
targets are for themselves, not only as consumers but as producers, working in a 
specific factory. Moreover there is no such thing as a decision "taken in full 
knowledge of the relevant facts", if that decision is not founded on a number of 
choices, each with its particular implications.</p>

<p class="fst">The fundamental decisional process might, therefore, take the 
following form. Starting from below, there would, at first, be discussions in 
the General Assemblies. Initial proposals would emanate from the Workers' 
Councils of various enterprises and would deal with their own productive 
possibilities in the period to come. The plan factory would then regroup these 
various proposals, pointing out which ones were mutually incompatible or 
entailed unintended effects on other sectors. It would elaborate a series of 
achievable targets, grouping them as far as possible in terms of their concrete 
implications. [Proposal A implies that factory X will next year increase its 
production by Y&nbsp;% with the help of additional equipment Z. Proposal B, on the 
other hand, implies..., etc.]</p>

<p class="fst">There would then be a full discussion of the various overall 
proposals, throughout the General Assemblies and by all the Workers' Councils, 
possibly with counter-proposals and a repetition of the procedure described. A 
final discussion would then lead to a simple majority vote in the General 
Assemblies.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="h22">8. The Management of the Economy</a></h2>

<p class="fst">We have spelled out the implications of workers' management at 
the level of a particular enterprise. These consist of the abolition of any 
separate managerial apparatus and of the assumption of managerial authority by 
the workers themselves, organized in Workers' Councils and in General Assemblies 
of one or more shops or offices, or of a whole enterprise.</p>

<p class="fst">Workers' management of the economy <u>as a whole</u> also implies 
that the management of the economy is not vested in the hands of a specific 
managerial stratum, but that it belongs to organized collectivities of 
producers.</p>

<p class="fst">What we have outlined in the previous sections shows that 
democratic management is perfectly feasible. Its basic assumption is the 
clarification of data and the mass utilization of what modern techniques have 
now made possible. It implies the conscious use of a series of devices and 
mechanisms (such as the genuine consumer "market", wage equality, the new 
relations between price and value &#8211; and of course, the plan factory) combined 
with real knowledge concerning economic reality. Together, these will help clear 
the ground. The major part of planning is just made up of tasks of execution and 
could safely be left to highly mechanized or automated offices, which would have 
no political or decisional role whatsoever, and would confine themselves to 
placing before society a variety of feasible plans and their full respective 
implications for everyone.</p>

<p class="fst">This general clearing of the ground having been achieved, and 
coherent possibilities having been presented to the people, the final choice 
will lie in their hands. Everyone will participate in deciding the ultimate 
targets "in full knowledge of the relevant facts", i.e., knowing the 
implications of his/her choice for <u>himself/herself</u> (both as producer and 
as consumer).</p>

<p class="fst">Once adopted, a given plan would provide the framework of 
economic activities for a given period. It would establish a starting point for 
economic life. But, in a free society, the plan will not <u>dominate</u> 
economic life. It is only a starting point, constantly to be taken up again and 
modified as necessary. Neither the economic life of society &#8211; nor its total life 
&#8211; can be based on a dead technological rationality, established once and for 
all. Society cannot alienate itself from its own decisions. It is not only that 
real life will almost of necessity diverge, in many aspects, from the "most 
perfect" plan in the world. It is also that workers' management will constantly 
tend to alter, both directly and indirectly, the basic data and targets of the 
plan. New products, new methods, new ideas, new problems, new difficulties and 
new solutions will constantly be emerging. Working times will be reduced. Prices 
will fall, entailing reactions of the consumers and displacements of demand. 
Some of these modifications will only affect a single factory, others several 
factories and yet others, no doubt, the economy as a whole.<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> The "plan 
factory" would, therefore, not only be called upon to work once every five 
years; it would daily have to tackle some problem or another.</p>

<p class="fst">All this deals mainly with the <u>form</u> of workers' management 
of the economy, and with the mechanisms and institutions that might ensure that 
it functions in a democratic manner. These forms would allow society to give to 
the management of the economy the <u>content</u> it chose. In a narrower sense, 
they would enable society to orient the economy in any particular direction.</p>

<p class="fst">It is almost certain that the direction chosen would be radically 
different from that proposed by the best intentioned ideologists or 
philanthropists of modern society. All such ideologists (whether "Marxist" or 
bourgeois) accept as self-evident that the ideal economy is one which allows the 
most rapid possible expansion of the productive forces and, as a corollary, the 
greatest possible reduction of the working day. This idea, considered in 
absolute terms, is absolutely absurd. It epitomizes the whole mentality, 
psychology, logic and metaphysic of capitalism, its reality as well as its 
schizophrenia. "Work is hell. It must be reduced." The rulers of modern society 
(East and West) believe that people will only be happy if they are provided with 
cars and butter. The population must therefore be made to feel that it can only 
be happy if the roads are choked with cars or if it can "catch up with American 
butter production within the next three years". And, when people acquire the 
said cars and the said butter, all that will be left for them to do will be to 
commit suicide, which is just what they do in that "ideal" country called 
Sweden. This "acquisitive" mentality which capitalism engenders, which helps 
capitalism live, without which capitalism could not exist, and which capitalism 
exacerbates to frenetic proportions, might just conceivably have been a useful 
aberration during a phase of human development. Socialist society will not be 
this absurd race after percentage increments in production. This will <u>not</u> 
be its basic concern.</p>

<p class="fst">In its initial phase, to be sure, socialist society will concern 
itself with satisfying consumer needs, and with a more balanced distribution of 
people's time between productive work and other activities. But, the real 
development of people and of social communities, will be socialism's central 
preoccupation. A very important part of social investment will, therefore, be 
geared to transforming machinery, to a universal and genuine education, to 
abolishing divisions between town and country, and between mental and manual 
labor. The growth of freedom <u>within</u> work, the development of the creative 
faculties of the producers, the creation of integrated and complete human 
communities, will be the paths along which socialist humanity will seek to find 
the meaning of its existence. These will, in addition, enable socialism to 
secure the material basis which it needs.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="h23">9. The Management of Society</a></h2>

<p class="fst">We have already discussed the type of change that would be 
brought about by the "vertical" and "horizontal" cooperation of Workers' 
Councils, a cooperation secured through industrial councils composed of 
delegates from various places of work. A similar regional cooperation would be 
established through Councils representing all the units of a region. Cooperation 
will finally be necessary on a national level, for all the activities of 
society, whether economic or not.</p>

<p class="fst">A central body, which would be the expression and the emanation 
of the producers themselves, would ensure the general tasks of economic 
coordination, inasmuch as they were not dealt with by the plan itself &#8211; or more 
precisely, inasmuch as the plan will have to be frequently or constantly amended 
(the very decision to suggest that it should be amended would have to be 
initiated somewhere). Such a body would also coordinate activities in other 
areas of social life, which have little or nothing to do with general economic 
planning. This central body would be the direct emanation of the Workers' 
Councils and of the local General Assemblies themselves. It would consist of a 
Central Assembly of Council Delegates, which Assembly would itself elect, from 
within its own ranks, a Central Council.</p>

<p class="fst">This network of General Assemblies and Councils is all that is 
left of "the <u>State</u>" or "<u>power</u>" in a socialist society. It is the 
<u>whole</u> "state" and the only embodiment of "power". There are no other 
institutions from which proposals or decisions might emanate to influence 
people's lives. To convince people that there would be no other "state" lurking 
in the background we must show:</p>

<p class="indentb"><b>a.</b> that such a pattern of organization could deal with 
<u>all</u> the problems that might arise in a free society &#8211; and not only with 
industrial problems;</p>

<p class="indentb"><b>b.</b> that institutions of the type described could 
coordinate all those social activities which the population felt needed 
coordination (in particular, non-economic activities) &#8211; in other words, that 
they could fulfill <u>all</u> the functions needed of a socialist administration 
(which are radically different from the functions of a modern State). We will 
finally have to discuss what would be the significance of "parties" and of 
"politics" in such a society.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h24">a. The Councils: An Adequate Organization for the Whole Population</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The setting-up of Workers' Councils will create no particular 
problems in relation to <u>industry</u> (taking the term in its widest sense to 
include manufacture, transport, building, mining, energy production, public 
services, etc.). The revolutionary transformation of society will, in fact, be 
based on the establishment of such Councils and would be impossible without it.</p>

<p class="fst">In the post-revolutionary period, however, when the new social 
relations become the norm, a problem will arise from the need to regroup people 
working in smaller enterprises. This regrouping will be necessary if only to 
ensure them their full democratic and representational rights. Initially, it 
would probably be based on some compromise between considerations of 
geographical proximity and considerations of industrial integration. This 
particular problem isn't very important, for even if there are many such small 
enterprises, the number of those working in them only represents a small 
proportion of the total working population.</p>

<p class="fst">Paradoxical as it may seem, the self-organization of the 
population into Councils could proceed as naturally in <u>agriculture</u> as in 
industry. It is traditional on the left to see the peasantry as a source of 
constant problems for working class power, because of its dispersion, its 
attachment to private property and its political and ideological backwardness. 
These factors certainly exist, but it is doubtful if the peasantry would 
actively oppose a working class power exhibiting towards it an intelligent and 
socialist attitude. The "peasant nightmare", currently obsessing so many 
revolutionaries, results from the telescoping of two quite different problems; 
on the one hand, the relations of the peasantry with a socialist administration, 
in the context of a modern society; on the other hand, the relations between 
peasantry and State in the Russia of 1921 (or of 1932), or in the satellite 
countries between 1945 and the present time.</p>

<p class="fst">The situation which led Russia to the New Economic Policy of 1921 
is of no exemplary value to any, even moderately, industrialized country. There 
is no chance of its repeating itself in a modern setting. In 1921, it was a 
question of an agriculture which did not depend on the rest of the national 
economy for its essential means of production, and which seven years of war and 
civil war had compelled to fall back on itself entirely. The Party was asking of 
this agriculture to supply its produce to the towns, without offering it 
anything in exchange. In 1932, in Russia (and after 1945 in the satellite 
countries), what happened was an absolutely healthy resistance of the peasantry 
to the monstrous exploitation imposed on it by a bureaucratic state, through 
forcible collectivization.</p>

<p class="fst">In a country such as France &#8211; classically considered "backward" 
in relation to the numerical importance of its peasantry &#8211; workers' power would 
not have to fear a "wheat strike". It would not have to organize punitive 
expeditions into the countryside. Precisely, because the peasant is concerned 
with his/her own interests, s/he would have no cause to quarrel with an 
administration which supplies him/her with petrol, electricity, fertilizers, 
threshing machines and spare parts. Peasants would only actively oppose such an 
administration if pushed to the limit, either by exploitation or by an absurd 
policy of forced collectivization. The socialist organization of the economy 
would mean an immediate improvement in the economic status of most peasants, if 
only through the abolition of that specific exploitation they are subjected to 
through middlemen. As for forced collectivization, it would be the very 
antithesis of socialist policy in the realm of agriculture. The collectivization 
of agriculture could only come about as the result of an organic development 
within the peasantry itself. Under no circumstances, could it be imposed through 
direct or indirect (economic) coercion.</p>

<p class="fst">A socialist society would start by recognizing the rights of the 
peasants to the widest autonomy in the management of their own affairs. It would 
invite them to organize themselves into Rural Communes, based on geographical or 
cultural units, and comprising approximately equal populations. Each such 
Commune would have, both in relation to the rest of society and in relation to 
its own organizational structure, the status of an enterprise. Its sovereign 
organism would, therefore, be the General Assembly of peasants and its 
representational unit the Peasant Council. Rural Communes and their Councils 
would be in charge of local self-administration. They, alone, would decide when 
or if they wanted to form producers' cooperatives, and under what conditions. In 
relation to the overall plan, it would be the Rural Communes and their Councils 
that would argue with the Central administration, and not individual peasants. 
Communes would undertake to deliver such-and-such a fraction of their produce 
(or a given amount of a specific product) in exchange for given credits<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a> or given amounts of the means of 
production. The Rural Communes themselves would decide how these would be 
distributed among their own members.</p>

<p class="fst">What about groups of workers involved in <u>services</u> of 
various kinds (from postmen to workers in entertainment)? There is no reason why 
the pattern of their self-organization should not resemble that pertaining in 
industry as a whole. And, what about the thousand-and-one petty trades existing 
in towns (shop-keepers, cobblers, hairdressers, doctors, tailors, etc.)? Here, 
the pattern of organization could resemble what we have outlined for an 
"atomized" occupation such as agriculture. Working class power would never seek 
forcibly to collectivize these occupations. It would only ask of these 
categories to group themselves into associations or cooperatives, which would at 
one-and-the-sametime constitute their representative political organs and their 
responsible units in relation to the management of the economy as a whole. There 
would be no question, for instance, of socialized industry individually 
supplying each particular shop or artisan. It would supply the cooperatives of 
which these shopkeepers or artisans would be members, and would entrust to these 
cooperatives themselves to distribute within their own ranks. At the political 
level, people in these occupations would seek representation through Councils, 
for it is difficult to see how else they could be genuinely represented. There 
would be no fraudulent elections of either the western or Russian types.</p>

<p class="fst">These solutions admittedly present serious shortcomings when 
compared with industrially based Workers' Councils &#8211; or even when compared with 
the Rural Communes. Workers' Councils or Rural Communes aren't primarily based 
on an occupation (when they are still so based, this would reflect their 
weakness rather than their strength). They are based on a <u>working</u> unity 
and on a shared life. In other words, Workers' Councils and Rural Communes are 
organic social units. A Cooperative of artisans or of petty traders, 
geographically scattered and living and working separately from one another, 
will only be based on a rather narrow community of interests. This fragmentation 
is a legacy of capitalism, which <u>socialist society</u> would sooner or later 
seek to transcend. There are possibly too many people in these occupations 
today. Under socialism, part of them would probably be absorbed into other 
occupations. Society would grant funds to the remainder to enable them, if they 
so wished, to organize themselves into larger, self-managed units.</p>

<p class="fst">When discussing people in these various occupations, we must 
repeat what we said about the peasantry &#8211; namely that we have no experience of 
what their attitudes might be to a socialist society. To start with, and up to a 
point, they will doubtless remain "attached to property". But up to what point? 
All that we know is how they reacted when Stalinism sought forcibly to drive 
them into a <u>concentration camp</u>. A society which would grant them autonomy 
in their own affairs, which would peacefully and rationally seek to integrate 
them into the overall pattern of social life, which would give them a living 
example of democratic self-management, and which would give them positive help 
if they wanted to proceed towards socialization, would certainly enjoy a 
different prestige in their eyes (and would have a different kind of influence 
on their development) than did an exploiting and totalitarian bureaucracy, which 
by every one of its acts reinforced their "attachment to property" and drove them 
centuries backward.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h25">b. The Councils and Social Life</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The basic units of social organization envisaged so far would not 
only manage <u>production</u>. They would, at the same time and primarily, be 
organs for popular self-management in all its aspects. They would be both organs 
of local self-administration and the only bases of the central power, which 
would only exist as a Federation or regrouping of all the Councils.</p>

<p class="fst">To say that a Workers' Council will be an organ of popular 
self-management (and not just an organ of workers' management of production), is 
to recognize that a factory or office isn't just a productive unit, but is also 
a social cell and locus of individual "socialization". Although this varies from 
country to country, and from workplace to workplace, a mass of activities, other 
than just earning a living, take place there (canteens, cooperatives, sports 
clubs, libraries, rest houses, collective outings, dances), activities which 
allow human ties both private and "public" to become established. To the extent 
that the average person is today active in "public" affairs, it is more likely 
to be through some activity related to work than in his capacity as an abstract 
"citizen", voting once every 5 years. Under socialism, the transformation of the 
relations of production, and of the very nature of work, would enormously 
reinforce the positive significance, for each worker, of the working collective 
to which s/he belonged.</p>

<p class="fst">Workers' Councils and Rural Communes would probably take over all 
"municipal" functions. They could also take over many others, which the 
monstrous centralization of the modern capitalist state has removed from the 
hands of local groups, with the sole aim of consolidating the dominion of the 
ruling class and of its bureaucracy over the whole population. Local Councils, 
for instance, might take over the local administration of justice and the local 
control of education.</p>

<p class="fst">The two forms of regroupment &#8211; productive and geographical &#8211; 
today seldom coincide. Peoples' homes are at variable distances from where they 
work. Where the scatter is small, as in a number of industrial towns or 
industrial suburbs (or in many Rural Communes), the management of production and 
local self-administration might be undertaken by the same General Assemblies and 
by the same Workers' Councils. Where home and work place don't overlap, 
geographically-based <u>local</u> Councils (Soviets) would have to be 
instituted, directly representing both the inhabitants of a given area and the 
enterprises in the area. Initially, such geographically-based local Councils 
may be necessary in many places. One might envisage them as "collateral" 
institutions, also in charge of local affairs. They would collaborate at local 
and at national level with the Councils of producers (Workers' Councils) which 
alone however would embody the new power <u>in production</u>.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The problems created by the parallel existence of the two kinds 
of Councils could soon be overcome, if changes took place in where people chose 
to live.<a href="#r17" name="rn17" target="_self">[17*]</a> This is but a small aspect of an important problem that will hang 
over the general orientation of socialist society for decades to come. 
Underlying these questions are all the economic, social and human problems of 
town planning in the deepest sense of the term. At the limit, there even lies 
the problem of town and country. It is not for us here to venture into these 
fields. All we can say is that a socialist society will have to tackle these 
problems as <u>total</u> problems, from the very start, for they impinge on 
every aspect of peoples' lives and on society's own economic, political and 
cultural purpose.</p>

<p class="fst">What we have said about local self-administration also applies to 
<u>regional</u> self-administration. Regional Federations of Workers' Councils or 
of Rural Communes will be in charge of coordinating these bodies at a regional 
level and of organizing activities best tackled at such a level.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h26">c. Industrial Organization of "State" Functions</a></h3>

<p class="fst">We have seen that a large number of functions of the modern State 
(and not merely "territorial" functions), will be taken over by local or 
regional organs of popular self-administration. But, what about the truly 
"central" functions, those which affect the totality of the population, in an 
indivisible manner?</p>

<p class="fst">In class societies, and in particular under classical 
19th-century "liberal" capitalism, the ultimate function of the State was to 
guarantee the maintenance of the existing social relations through the exercise 
of a legal monopoly of violence. According to classical revolutionary theory, 
the state consisted of "specialized bodies of armed men, and prisons". In the 
course of a socialist revolution, this state apparatus would be smashed, the 
"specialized detachments of armed men" dissolved and replaced by the arming of 
the people, the permanent bureaucracy abolished, and replaced by elected and 
revocable officials.</p>

<p class="fst">Under modern capitalism, increasing economic concentration and 
the increasing concentration of all aspects of social life (with the 
corresponding need for the ruling class to submit everything to its control), 
have led to an enormous growth of the state apparatus, of its functions, and of 
its bureaucracy. The State is no longer just a coercive apparatus which has 
elevated itself "above" society. It is the hub of a whole series of mechanisms 
whereby modern society functions from <u>day to day</u>. At the limit, the 
modern State subtends <u>all</u> social activity, as in the fully developed 
state capitalist regimes of Russia and the satellite countries. Even in the 
West, the modern state does not only exercise "power" in the narrow sense, but 
takes on an ever-increasing role in <u>management</u> and <u>control</u> not 
only of the economy, but of a whole mass of social activities. In parallel with 
all this, the State takes on a whole lot of functions which in themselves could 
perfectly well be carried out by other bodies, but which have either become 
useful instruments of control, or which imply the mobilization of considerable 
resources which the State alone possesses.</p>

<p class="fst">In many people's minds, the myth of the "State, as the 
incarnation of the Absolute Idea" (which Engels mocked a century ago), has been 
replaced by another myth, the myth of the State as the inevitable incarnation of 
centralization and of the "technical rationalization" required by modern social 
life. This has had two main effects. On the one hand, it has led to people 
considering outmoded, utopian or inapplicable some of the more revolutionary 
insights of Marx or Lenin (in relation to the events of 1848, 1871, or 1905). On 
the other hand, it has led to people swallowing the reality of the modern 
Russian State, which simultaneously epitomizes<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a> the most total negation of 
previous revolutionary conceptions of what socialist society might be like, and 
exhibits a monstrous increase of those very features criticized, in capitalist 
society, by previous revolutionaries (the total separation of rulers and ruled, 
permanent officialdom, great privileges for the few, etc.).</p>

<p class="fst">But, this very evolution of the modern state contains the seed of 
a solution. The modern state has become a gigantic enterprise &#8211; by far the most 
important enterprise in modern society. It can only exercise its <u>managerial</u> 
functions to the extent that it has created a whole network of organs of 
<u>execution</u>, in which work has become collective, fragmented and specialized. 
What has happened here is the same as what has happened to the management of 
production in particular enterprises. But, it has happened on a much vaster 
scale. In their overwhelming majority, today's government departments only carry 
out specific and limited tasks. They are "enterprises", specializing in certain 
types of work. Some (such as Public Health) are socially necessary. Others (such 
as Customs) are quite useless, or are only necessary in order to maintain the 
class structure of society (such as the Police). Modern governments often have 
little more real links with the work of "their" departments than they have, say, 
with the production of motor cars. The notion of "administrative rights", which 
remains appended to what are, in fact, a series of "public services", is a 
juridical legacy, without real content. Its only purpose is to reinforce the 
arbitrariness and irresponsibility of those at the top of various bureaucratic 
pyramids.</p>

<p class="fst">Given these facts, the solution would not lie in the "eligibility 
and revocability" of all public servants. This would be neither necessary (these 
officials exercise no real power) nor possible (they are specialized workers, 
whom one could no more "elect" than one would elect electricians or doctors). 
The solution would lie in the <u>industrial organization</u>, pure and simple, 
of most of today's government departments. In many cases, this would only be 
giving formal recognition to an already existing state of affairs. Concretely, 
such industrial organization would mean:</p>

<p class="indentb">a. the explicit transformation of these government departments 
into "enterprises" having the same status as any other enterprise. In many of 
these new enterprises, the mechanization and automation of work could be 
systematically developed to a considerable degree;</p>

<p class="indentb">b. the function of these enterprises would be confined to the 
carrying out of the tasks allotted to them by the representative institutions of 
society;</p>

<p class="indentb">c. the management of these enterprises would be through Workers' 
Councils, representing those who work there. These office workers, like all 
others, would determine the organization of their own work.<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">We have seen that the "plan factory" would be organized in this 
way. A similar pattern might apply to whatever persists or could be used of any 
current structure relating to <u>the economy</u> (foreign trade, agriculture, 
finance, industry). Current State functions, which are already "industrial" 
(public works, public transport, communications) would be similarly organized. 
So, probably, would education, although here there would be latitude for a very 
wide variety of techniques and experiments.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h27">d. The "Central Assembly" and Its "Council"</a></h3>

<p class="fst">What remains of the functions of a modern state will be discussed 
under three headings:</p>

<p class="indentb">(a) the material basis of authority and coercion, "the specialized 
bands of armed men and prisons" (in other words the army and the law);</p>

<p class="indentb">(b) internal and external "politics", in the narrow sense (in 
other words the problems that might be posed to a self-managed society if 
confronted with internal opposition or with the persistence of hostile 
exploiting regimes in neighboring countries);</p>

<p class="indentb">(c) real politics: the overall vision, coordination and general 
purpose of social life.</p>

<p class="fst">Concerning the Army, it is obvious that "the specialized bands of 
armed men" would be dissolved. The people would be armed. If war or civil war 
developed, workers in factories, offices and Rural Communes would constitute the 
units of a non-permanent, territorially-based militia, each Council being in 
charge of its own area. Regional regroupings would enable local units to become 
integrated, and if necessary, would allow the rational use of heavier 
armament.<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> If it proved necessary, each Council would probably contribute a 
contingent to the formation of certain central units, which would be under the 
control of the Central Assembly of Delegates.<a href="#r18" name="rn18" target="_self">[18*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As for the <u>administration of justice</u>, it would be in the 
hands of rank-and-file bodies. Each Council might act as a "lower court" in 
relation to "offenses" committed in its area. Individual rights would be 
guaranteed by procedural rules established by the Central Assembly, and might 
include the right of appeal to the Regional Councils or to the Central Assembly 
itself. There would be no question of a "penal code" or of prisons, the very 
notion of punishment being absurd from a socialist point of view. "Judgments" 
could only aim at the re-education of the social "delinquent" and at his/her 
reintegration into the new life. Deprivation of freedom only has a meaning if 
one considers that a particular individual constitutes a permanent threat to 
others (and in that case, what is needed is not a penitentiary but the medical &#8211; 
and much more often social &#8211; help of fellow human beings).<a href="#r19" name="rn19" target="_self">[19*]</a></p>

<p class="fst"><u>Political problems</u> &#8211; in the narrow, as well as in the 
broader sense &#8211; are problems concerning the whole population, and which the 
population as a whole is, therefore alone, in a position to solve. But, people 
can only solve them if they are organized to this end. At the moment, everything 
is devised so as to prevent people from dealing with such problems. People are 
conned into believing that political problems can only be solved by the 
politicians, those specialists of the universal, whose most universal attribute 
is precisely their ignorance of any particular reality.</p>

<p class="fst">The necessary organizations will comprise, first of all, the 
Workers' Councils and the General Assemblies of each particular enterprise. 
These will provide living <i>milieux</i> for the confrontation of views and for 
the elaboration of informed political opinions. They will be the ultimate 
sovereign authorities for all political decisions. But, there will also be a 
central institution, directly emanating from these grass-roots organizations, 
namely the Central Assembly of Delegates. The existence of such a body is 
necessary, not only because some problems require an immediate decision (even if 
such a decision is subsequently reversed by the population) &#8211; but more 
particularly because preliminary checking, clarification, and elaboration of the 
facts is nearly always necessary &#8211; before any meaningful decision <u>can</u> be 
taken. To ask the people as a whole to pronounce themselves without any such 
preparation, would often be a mystification and a negation of democracy (because 
it would imply people having to decide without full knowledge of the relevant 
facts). There must be a framework for discussing problems and for submitting 
them to popular decision, or even for suggesting that they should be discussed. 
These are not just "technical" functions. They are <u>deeply political</u>, and 
the body that would initiate them would be, whether one liked it or not, an 
indispensable central institution &#8211; although entirely different in its structure 
and role from any contemporary central body.</p>

<p class="fst">The real problem &#8211; which in our opinion should be discussed 
rationally and without excitement &#8211; isn't whether such a body should exist or 
not. It is how to ensure that it is organized in such a manner that it no longer 
incarnates the alienation of political power in society and the vesting of 
authority in the hands of specialized institutions, separate from the population 
as a whole. The problem is to ensure that any central body is the <u>genuine</u> 
expression and embodiment of popular will. We think this is perfectly possible 
under modern conditions.</p>

<p class="fst">The Central Assembly of Delegates would be composed of men and 
women elected directly by the local General Assemblies of various factories and 
offices. These people would be revocable at all times by the bodies that elected 
them. <u>They would remain at work</u>, just as would the delegates to the local 
Workers' Councils. Delegates to the Central Assembly would meet in plenary 
session as often as necessary. In meeting twice a week, or during one week of 
each month, they would almost certainly get through more work than any present 
parliament (which hardly gets through any). At frequent intervals (perhaps once 
a month), they would have to give an account of their mandate to those who had 
elected them.<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Those elected to the Central Assembly would elect from within 
their own ranks &#8211; or would appoint to act in rotation &#8211; a Council, perhaps 
composed of a few dozen members. The tasks of this body would be restricted to 
preparing the work of the Central Assembly of Delegates, to deputizing for it 
when it was not in session, and to convening the Assembly urgently, if 
necessary.</p>

<p class="fst">If this "Central Council" exceeded its jurisdiction and took a 
decision which could or should have been taken by the Central Assembly, or if it 
took any unacceptable decisions, these could immediately be rescinded by the 
next meeting of the Central Assembly, which could also take any measures 
necessary, up to and including the "dissolution" of its own Council. If, on the 
other hand, the Central Assembly took any decision which exceeded its 
jurisdiction, or which properly belonged to the local Workers' Councils or to 
the local General Assemblies, it would be up to these bodies to take any steps 
necessary, up to and including the revocation of their delegates to the Central 
Assembly. Neither the Central Council nor the Central Assembly could persevere 
in unacceptable practices (they would have no power of their own, they would be 
revocable, and in the last analysis, the population would be armed). But, if the 
Central Assembly allowed its Council to exceed its rights &#8211; or, if members of 
local Assemblies allowed their delegates to the Central Assembly to exceed their 
authority &#8211; nothing could be done. The population <u>can</u> only exercise 
political power if it <u>wants</u> to. The organization proposed would ensure 
that the population <u>could</u> exercise such power, if it <u>wanted</u> to.</p>

<p class="fst">But, this very will to take affairs into one's own hands isn't 
some blind force, appearing and disappearing in some mysterious way. Political 
alienation in capitalist society isn't just the product of existing institutions 
which, by their very structure, make it technically impossible for the popular 
will to express or fulfill itself. Contemporary political alienation stems from 
the fact that this will is destroyed <u>at its roots</u>, that its very growth 
is thwarted, and that finally all interest in public affairs is totally 
suppressed. There is nothing more sinister than the utterances of sundry 
liberals, bemoaning the "political apathy of the people", an apathy which the 
political and social system to which they subscribe would recreate daily, if it 
didn't exist already. This suppression of political will in modern societies 
stems as much from the <u>content</u> of modern "politics" as from the <u>means</u> 
available for political expression. It is based on the <u>unbridgeable gulf</u> 
that today separates "politics" from real life. The content of modern politics 
is the "better" organization of exploiting society: the better to exploit 
society itself. Its methods are necessarily mystifying: they resort either to 
direct lies or to meaningless abstractions. The world in which all this takes 
place is a world of "specialists", of underhand deals and of spurious 
"technicism".</p>

<p class="fst">All this will be radically changed in a socialist society. 
Exploitation having been eliminated, the content of politics will be the better 
organization of our common life. An immediate result will be a different 
attitude of ordinary people towards public affairs. Political problems will be 
everyone's problems, whether they relate to where one works or deal with much 
wider issues. People will begin to feel that their concerns have a real impact, 
and perceptible results should soon be obvious to all. The method of the new 
politics will be to make real problems accessible to all. The gulf separating 
"political affairs" from everyday life will narrow and eventually disappear.</p>

<p class="fst">All this warrants some comment. Modern sociologists often claim 
that the content and methods of modern politics are inevitable. They believe 
that the separation of politics from life is due to an irreversible 
technological evolution, which makes impossible any real democracy. It is 
alleged that the content of politics &#8211; namely the management of society &#8211; has 
become highly complex, embracing an extraordinary mass of data and problems, 
each of which can only be understood as a result of advanced specialization. All 
this allegedly being so, it is proclaimed as self-evident that these problems 
could never be put to the public in any intelligible way &#8211; or only by 
simplifying them to a degree that would distort them altogether. Why be 
surprised then, that ordinary people take no more interest in politics than they 
do in differential calculus?</p>

<p class="fst">If these "arguments" &#8211; presented as the very latest in political 
sociology, but in fact, as old as the world<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a> 
&#8211; prove anything, it is not that 
democracy is a utopian illusion but that the very management of society, by 
whatever means, has become impossible. The politician, according to these 
premises, would have to be the "Incarnation of Absolute and Total Knowledge". No 
technical specialization, however advanced, entitles its possessor to influence 
areas other than his/her own. An assembly of technicians, each the highest 
authority in his/her particular field &#8211; would have no competence (as an assembly 
of technicians) to solve anything.</p>

<p class="fst">Only one individual could comment on any specific point, and no 
one would be in a position to comment on any general problem.</p>

<p class="fst">In fact, modern society is not managed by technicians as such 
(and never could be). Those who manage it don't incarnate "Absolute Knowledge" &#8211; 
but rather generalized incompetence. In fact, modern society is hardly managed 
at all &#8211; it just drifts. Just like the bureaucratic apparatus at the head of 
some big factory, a modern political "leadership" only renders verdicts &#8211; and, 
usually quite arbitrary ones. It decides between the opinions of the various 
technical departments designed to "assist" it, and over which it has very little 
control. In this, our rulers are themselves caught up in their own social 
system, and experience the same political alienation which they impose on the 
rest of society. The chaos of their own social organization renders impossible a 
rational exercise of their own power even in their own terms.<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">We discuss all this because it enables us once again to stress an 
important truth. In the case of politics as in the case of production, people 
tend to blame modern technology or modern "technicism", in general, instead of 
seeing that the problems stem from a <u>specifically capitalist technology</u>. 
In politics, as in production, capitalism doesn't only mean the use of 
technically "neutral" means for capitalist ends. It also means the creation and 
development of specific techniques, aimed at ensuring the exploitation of the 
producers &#8211; or the oppression, mystification and political manipulation of 
citizens, in general. <u>At the level of production</u>, <u>socialism will mean 
the conscious transformation of technology</u>. <u>Technique will be made to 
help the people</u>. <u>At the level of politics</u>, <u>socialism will imply a 
similar transformation</u>: <u>technique will be made to help democracy</u>.</p>

<p class="fst">Political technique is based essentially on the techniques of 
information and of communication. We are here using the term "technique" in the 
widest sense (the <u>material means</u> of information and of communication only 
comprise a part of the corresponding techniques). To place the <u>technique of 
information</u> at the service of democracy doesn't only mean to put material 
means of expression in the hands of the people (essential as this may be). Nor 
does it mean the dissemination of <u>all</u> information, or of <u>any</u> 
information, in whatever form. It means, first and foremost, to put at the 
disposal of mankind the necessary elements enabling people to decide in full 
knowledge of the relevant facts. In relation to the plan factory, we have given 
a specific example of how information could be used so as vastly to increase 
people's areas of freedom. Genuine information would not consist in burying 
everyone under whole libraries of textbooks on economics, technology and 
statistics: the information that would result from this would be strictly nil. 
The information provided by the plan factory would be <u>compact</u>, 
<u>significant</u>, <u>sufficient</u> and <u>truthful</u>. Everyone will know what 
s/he will have to contribute and the level of consumption s/he will enjoy if 
this or that variant of the plan is adopted. This is how technique (in this 
instance economic analysis, statistics, and computers) could be put at the 
service of democracy in a decisive field.</p>

<p class="fst">The same applies to the technique of communication. It is claimed 
that the very size of modern societies precludes the exercise of any genuine 
democracy. Distances and numbers allegedly render direct democracy impossible. 
The only feasible democracy it is claimed is representative democracy, which 
"inevitably" contains a kernel of political alienation, namely, the separation 
of the representatives from those they represent.</p>

<p class="fst">In fact, there are several ways of envisaging and of achieving 
representative democracy. Parliament is one. Councils are another, and it is 
difficult to see how political alienation could arise in a properly functioning 
Council system. If modern techniques of communication were put at the service of 
democracy, the areas where representative democracy would remain necessary would 
narrow down considerably. Material distances are smaller in the modern world 
than they were in Attica, in the 5th century B.C. At that time the voice range 
of the orator &#8211; and hence, the number of people s/he could reach &#8211; was limited 
by the functional capacity of his/her vocal cords. Today, it is unlimited. In 
the realm of communicating ideas, distances haven't only narrowed &#8211; they have 
disappeared.</p>

<p class="fst">If society felt it to be necessary, one could, as from today, 
establish a General Assembly of the whole population of any modern country. 
Radio-television could easily link up a vast number of General Assemblies, in 
various factories, offices, or rural Communes. Similar, but more limited, 
link-ups could be established in a vast number of cases.<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a> The sessions of the 
Central Assembly or of its Council could easily be televised. This, combined 
with the revocability of all delegates, would readily ensure that any central 
institution remained under the permanent control of the population. It would 
profoundly alter the very notion of "representation".<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a></p>

<p class="fst">People bemoan the fact that the size of the modern "city", 
compared with those of yesterday (tens of millions rather than tens of 
thousands), renders direct democracy impossible. They are doubly blind. They 
don't see, firstly, that modern society has recreated the very <i>milieu</i>, 
the work place, where such democracy could be reinstituted. Nor do they see that 
modern society has created and will continue to create the technical means for a 
genuine democracy on a massive scale. They envisage the only solution to the 
problems of the supersonic age in the coach-and-four terms of parliamentary 
political machinery. And, they then conclude that democracy has become 
"impossible". They claim to have made a "new" analysis &#8211; and, they have ignored 
what is really new in our epoch: the material possibilities of at last 
transforming the world through technique, and through the mass of ordinary 
people who are its living vehicle.</p>

<h3><a name="h28">e. The "State", "Parties", and "Politics"</a></h3>

<p class="fst">What would "the state", "politics", and "parties" consist of in 
such a society? There would be residues of a "state" to the extent that there 
would not immediately be a pure and simple "administration of things", that 
majority decisions would still prevail, and that there, therefore, still 
remained some limitations to individual freedom. There would no longer be a 
"state" to the extent that the bodies exercising power would be none other than 
the productive units or local organizations of the whole population, that the 
institutions organizing social life would be but one aspect of that life itself, 
and that what remained of central bodies would be under the direct and permanent 
control of the base organizations. This would be the starting point. Social 
development could not but bring about a rapid reduction of the central aspects 
of social organization: the reasons for exercising constraints would gradually 
disappear, and the fields of individual freedom would enlarge. [Needless to say, 
we are not talking here about formal "democratic freedoms", which a socialist 
society would immediately and vastly expand, but about the "essential" freedoms: 
not only the right to live, but the right to do what one wants with one's life.]</p>

<p class="fst">Freed from all the paraphernalia and mystifications which 
currently surround it, politics in such a society would be nothing but the 
collective discussing and solving of problems concerning the future of society &#8211; 
whether these be economic, education, sexual &#8211; or whether they dealt with the 
rest of the world, or with internal relations between social groups. All these 
matters which concern the whole of the population would belong to them.</p>

<p class="fst">It is probable, even certain, that there would be different views 
about such problems. Each approach would seek to be as coherent and systematic 
as possible. People, dispersed geographically or professionally, might share 
particular viewpoints. These people would come together to defend their views, in other words would form political groups.</p>

<p class="fst">There would be no point in pretending that a contradiction 
wouldn't exist between the existence of such groups and the role of the 
Councils. Both could not develop simultaneously. If the Councils fulfill their 
function, they will provide the main living <i>milieu</i> not only for political 
confrontations, but also for the formation of political opinions. Political 
groups, on the other hand, are more exclusive <i>milieux</i> for the schooling 
of their members, as well as being more exclusive poles for their loyalty. The 
parallel existence of both Councils and political groups would imply that a part 
of real political life would be taking place elsewhere than in the Councils. 
People would then tend to act in the Councils according to decisions already 
taken outside of them. Should this tendency predominate, it would bring about 
the rapid atrophy and finally the disappearance of the Councils. Conversely, 
real socialist development would be characterized by the progressive atrophy of 
established political groups.</p>

<p class="fst">This contradiction could not be abolished by a stroke of the pen 
or by any "statutory" decree. The persistence of political groups would reflect 
the continuation of characteristics inherited from capitalist society, in 
particular, the persistence of diverging interests (and their corresponding 
ideologies), even after their material basis had shrunk. People will not form 
parties for or against the Quantum Theory, nor in relation to simple differences 
of opinion about this or that. The flowering or final atrophy of political 
groups will depend on the ability of workers' power to unite society.<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a></p>

<p class="fst">If organizations expressing the survival of different interests 
and ideologies persist, a libertarian socialist organization, voicing its own 
particular outlook, will also have to exist. It will be open to all who favor 
the total power of the Councils, and will differ from all others, both in its 
<i>programme</i> and in its practice, precisely on this point: its fundamental 
activity will be directed towards the concentration of power in the Councils and 
to their becoming the only centers of political life. This implies that the 
libertarian organization would have to struggle against power being held by any 
particular party, whatever it may be.</p>

<p class="fst">It is obvious that the democratic power structure of a socialist 
society excludes the possibility of a Party "holding power". The very words 
would be meaningless within the framework we have described. Insofar as major 
trends of opinion might arise or diverge on important issues, the holders of 
majority viewpoints might be elected delegates to the Councils more often than 
others, etc. [This doesn't necessarily follow, however, for delegates would be 
elected mainly on the basis of a total trust, and not always according to their 
opinion on this or that question.] The parties would not be organizations 
seeking power; and the Central Assembly of Delegates would not be a "Workers' 
Parliament"; people would not be elected to it as members of a party. The same 
goes for any Council chosen by this Central General Assembly.</p>

<p class="fst">The role of a libertarian socialist organization would initially 
be important. It would have systematically and coherently to defend these 
conceptions. It would have to conduct an important struggle to unmask and 
denounce bureaucratic tendencies, not in general, but where they concretely show 
themselves; and above all, it might initially be the only group capable of 
showing the ways and means whereby working class democracy might flower. The 
work of the group could, for instance, considerably hasten the setting-up of the 
democratic planning mechanisms we have analyzed earlier.</p>

<p class="fst">A libertarian organization is, in fact, the only place where, in 
exploiting society, a get-together of workers and intellectuals can already be 
achieved. This fusion would enable the rapid use of technology by the organs of 
working class power. But, if some years after the revolution, the libertarian 
group continued to grow, it would be the surest sign that it was dead &#8211; as a 
libertarian revolutionary organization.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h29">f. Freedom and Workers' Power</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The problem of political freedom arises in two forms: freedom for 
political organizations and the rights of various social strata of the 
population.</p>

<p class="fst">Nationally, the Councils alone would be in a position to judge to 
what extent the activities of any given political organization could be 
tolerated. The basic criterion which would guide their judgment would be whether 
the organization in question was seeking to re-establish an exploiting regime. 
In other words, was it trying to abolish the power of the Councils? If they 
judged this to be the case, the Councils would have the right and the duty to 
defend themselves, at the ultimate limit by curtailing such activities. But this 
yardstick won't provide an automatic answer in every specific instance, for the 
very good reason that no such universal answer can ever exist. The Councils will 
each time have to carry the political responsibility for their answers, steering 
a course between two equal and very serious dangers: either to allow freedom of 
action to enemies of socialism who seek to destroy it &#8211; or, to kill 
self-management themselves through the restriction of political freedom. There 
is no absolute or abstract answer to this dilemma. Nor is it any use trying to 
minimize the extent of the problem by saying that any important political 
tendency would be represented <u>inside</u> the Councils: it is perfectly 
possible and even quite probable that there might exist within the Councils 
tendencies <u>opposed</u> to their total power.<a href="#r20" name="rn20" target="_self">[20*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The "legality of Soviet Parties", a formula through which Trotsky 
believed, in 1936, that he could answer this problem, in fact, answers nothing. 
If the only dangers confronting socialist society were those due to 
"restorationist" tendencies, there would be little to fear for such parties 
wouldn't find much support in the workers' assemblies. They would automatically 
exclude themselves from meaningful political life. But, the main danger 
threatening the socialist revolution, after the liquidation of private 
capitalism, doesn't arise from restorationist tendencies. It stems from 
<u>bureaucratic</u> tendencies. Such tendencies may find support in some sections 
of the working class, the more so as their <i>programmes</i> do not and would 
not aim at restoring traditional and known forms of exploitation, but would be 
presented as "variants" of socialism. In the beginning, when it is most 
dangerous, bureaucratism is neither a social system nor a definite <i>programme</i>: 
it is only an attitude in practice. The Councils will be able to fight 
bureaucracy only as a result of their own concrete experience. But, the 
revolutionary tendency inside the Councils will always denounce "one-man 
management" &#8211; as practiced in Russia &#8211; or the centralized management of the 
whole economy by a separate apparatus &#8211; as practiced in Russia, Poland or 
Yugoslavia. <u>It will denounce them as variants</u>, <u>not of socialism</u>, 
<u>but of exploitation</u>, and it will struggle for all light to be shed on the 
organizations propagating such aims.</p>

<p class="fst">It is hardly necessary to add, that although it might conceivably 
become necessary to limit the political activity of this or that organization, 
no limitation is conceivable in the domains of ideology or of culture.</p>

<p class="fst">Another problem might arise: should all sections of the 
population, from the beginning, have the same rights? Are they equally able to 
participate in the political management of society? What does working class 
power mean in such circumstances? Working class power means the incontrovertible 
fact that the initiative for and the direction of the socialist revolution and 
the subsequent transformation of society can only belong to the working class. 
Therefore, it means that the origin and the center of socialist power will quite 
literally be the Workers' Councils. But, working people do not aim at 
instituting a dictatorship over society and over the other strata of the 
population. Their aim is to install socialism, a society in which differences 
between strata or classes must diminish rapidly and soon disappear. The working 
class will only be able to take society in the direction of socialism to the 
extent that it associates other sections of the population with its aims. Or, to 
the extent that it grants them the fullest autonomy compatible with the general 
orientation of society. Or, that it raises them to the rank of active subjects 
of social management, and does not see them as objects of its own control &#8211; 
which would be in conflict with its whole outlook. All this is expressed in the 
general organization of the population into Councils, in the extensive autonomy 
of the Councils in their own field, and in the participation of all these 
Councils in the central administration.</p>

<p class="fst">What happens if the working class does not vastly outnumber the 
rest of the population? Or, if the revolution is from the start in a difficult 
position, other strata being actively hostile to the power of the Workers' 
Councils? Working class power might then find concrete expression in an 
<u>unequal</u> participation of the various strata of society in the central 
administration. In the beginning, for example, the proletariat might have to 
allow a smaller voice to the Peasants Councils than to other Councils, even if 
it allows this voice to grow as class tensions diminish. But, the real 
implications of these questions are limited. The working class could only keep 
power if it gained the support of the majority of those who work for a living, 
even if they are not industrial workers. In modern societies, wage and salary 
earners constitute the overwhelming majority of the population, and each day 
increases their numerical importance. If the large majority of industrial 
workers <u>and other wage earners</u> supported revolutionary power, the regime 
could not be endangered by the political opposition of the peasants. If the 
aforementioned sections did <u>not</u> support revolutionary power, it is 
difficult to see how the revolution could triumph, and even more how it could 
last for any length of time.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<h2><a name="h30">10. Problems of the Transition</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The society we are talking about is not communism, which supposes 
total freedom, the complete control by people over all their own activities, the 
absence of any constraint, total abundance &#8211; and human beings of a totally 
different kind.</p>

<p class="fst">The society we are talking about is socialism, and socialism is 
the <u>only transitional</u> society between a regime of exploitation and 
communism. What is not socialism (as here defined) isn't a transitional society, 
but an <u>exploiting</u> society. We might say that any exploiting society is a 
society of transition, but of transition to another form of exploitation. The 
transition <u>to communism</u> is only possible if <u>exploitation</u> is 
immediately abolished, for otherwise, exploitation continues and feeds on 
itself. The abolition of exploitation is only possible when every separate 
stratum of order-givers ceases to exist, for in modern societies it is the 
division into order-givers and order-takers which is at the root of 
exploitation. The abolition of a separate managerial apparatus means workers' 
management in all sectors of social activity. Workers' management is only 
possible through new institutions embodying the direct democracy of the 
producers (the Councils). Workers' management can only be consolidated and 
enlarged insofar as it attacks the deepest roots of alienation in all fields and 
primarily in the realm of work.</p>

<p class="fst">In their essence, these views closely coincide with Marx's ideas 
on the subject. Marx only considered <u>one</u> kind of transitional society 
between capitalism and communism, which he called indifferently "dictatorship of 
the proletariat" or "lower stage of communism". For him, this society implied an 
end to exploitation and to a separate state apparatus.</p>

<p class="fst">These elementary truths have been systematically hidden or 
distorted. Let us leave aside the Stalinists, whose historic job it has been to 
present concentration camps, the absolute power of factory managers, piece-rates 
and <i>Stakhanovism</i> as the finished products of socialism. The same 
mystification, in a more subtle but just as dangerous form, has been propagated 
by the Trotskyists and by Trotsky himself. They have managed to invent an 
increasing number of transitional societies, slotting more or less happily into 
one another. Between communism and capitalism, there was socialism. But between 
socialism and capitalism there was the Workers' State. And between the Workers' 
State and capitalism there was the "degenerated Workers' State" (degeneration 
being a process, there were gradations: degenerated, very degenerated, 
monstrously degenerated, etc.). After the War, according to the Trotskyists, we 
witnessed the birth of a whole series of "degenerated Workers' States" (the 
satellite countries of Eastern Europe), which were degenerated without ever 
having been Workers' States. All these gymnastics were performed so as to avoid 
having to admit that Russia was an exploiting society without a shred of 
socialism about it, and so as to avoid drawing the conclusion that the fate of 
the Russian Revolution made it imperative to re-examine all the problems 
relating to the programme and content of socialism, to the role of the 
proletariat, to the role of the Party, etc.</p>

<p class="fst">The idea of a "transitional society" other than a socialist 
society is a mystification. This is not to say, far from it, that <u>problems</u> 
of transition do not exist. In a sense, the whole of socialist society is 
determined by the existence of these problems, and by the attempt of people at 
solving them. But, problems of transition will also exist in a narrower sense. 
They will flow from the concrete conditions which will confront the revolution 
at the start.</p>

<p class="fst">For instance, the Revolution might only start in one country, or 
in one group of countries. As a result, it would have to sustain pressures of a 
very different kind and duration. On the other hand, however swift the 
international spread of the revolution, a country's internal development will 
play an important role in allowing the principles of socialism to be applied. 
For example, agriculture might create important problems in France, but not in 
the USA or Great Britain (where the main problem would be that of the extreme 
dependence of the country on food imports). In the course of our analysis, we 
have considered several problems of this kind and hope to have shown that 
solutions tending in a socialist direction existed in each case.</p>

<p class="fst">We have not been able to consider the special problems which 
would arise if the revolution remained isolated in one country for a long time &#8211; 
and we can hardly do it here. But, we hope to have shown that it is wrong to 
think that the problems arising from such an isolation are insoluble, that an 
isolated workers' power must die heroically or degenerate, or that it can at the 
most "hold on" while waiting. The only way to "hold on" is to start building 
socialism, otherwise degeneration has already set in, and the reason for 
"holding on" is nothing. For workers' power, the building of socialism from the 
very first day is not only possible, it is imperative. If it doesn't take place, 
the power held has already ceased to be workers' power.<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The <i>programme</i> we have outlined is a <i>programme</i> for 
the present, capable of being realized in any reasonably industrialized country. 
It describes the steps &#8211; or the spirit guiding the steps &#8211; which the Councils 
will have to take from the very first weeks of their power, and this, whether 
this power has spread to several countries or is confined to one. Perhaps, if we 
were talking about Albania, there would be little we could do. But, if tomorrow 
in France, or in Britain, or even in Poland (as yesterday in Hungary), Workers' 
Councils emerged without having to face a foreign military invasion, they could 
only:</p>

<p class="indentb">- federate into a Central Assembly and declare themselves the 
only power in the land;</p>
<p class="indentb">- proceed to arm the working class and order the dissolution of 
the police and of the standing army;</p>
<p class="indentb">- proclaim the expropriation of the capitalists, the dismissal 
of all managers, and the taking over of the management of all factories by the 
workers themselves organized into Workers' Councils;</p>
<p class="indentb">- proclaim the abolition of work norms and institute full 
equality of wages and salaries;</p>
<p class="indentb">- encourage other categories of workers to form Councils and to 
take into their own hands the management of their respective enterprises;</p>
<p class="indentb">- ask, in particular, the workers in government departments to 
form Councils to proclaim the transformation of these state bodies into 
enterprises managed by those who work in them;</p>	<p class="indentb">- encourage the peasants and other self-employed sections of 
the population to group themselves into Councils and to send their 
representatives to a Central Assembly;</p>
<p class="indentb">- proceed to organize a "plan factory" and promptly submit a 
provisional economic plan for discussion by the local Councils;</p>
<p class="indentb">- call on the workers of other countries and explain to them 
the content and meaning of these measures.</p>
<p class="fst">All this would be immediately necessary. And, it would contain 
all that is essential to the building of socialism.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n2" href="#fn2">[2]</a> The belief that socialism can be achieved through Parliament 
is, therefore, naive in the extreme. Moreover, it perpetuates illusions in the

<p class="endnote"><a name="n3" href="#fn3">[3]</a> In the first chapter of his book, <a href="../../pannekoe/1947/workers-councils.htm">The Workers' Councils</a> 
(Melbourne: 1950), Anton Pannekoek develops a similar analysis of the problems 
confronting socialist society. On the fundamental issues our points of view are 
very close.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n4" href="#fn4">[4]</a> Bakunin once described the problem of socialism as being "to 
integrate individuals into structures which they could understand and control".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n5" href="#fn5">[5]</a> The words are to be found in "Part III" of Engels" 
<a href="../../marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/index.htm">Anti-Dühring</a>.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> A few years ago a certain "philosopher" could seriously ask 
how one could even discuss Stalin's decisions, as one didn't know the real facts 
upon which he alone could base them. (J. P. Sartre, "<i>Les Communistes et la 
Paix</i>", in <i>Les Temps Modernes</i>, July and October-November of 1952).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n7" href="#fn7">[7]</a> We deliberately say "to institute" and not "to restore", for 
never in history has this domination really existed. All comparisons with 
historical antecedents &#8211; for instance, with the situations of the artisan or of 
the free peasant, however fruitful they may be in some respects, have only a 
limited scope and risk leading one into utopian thinking.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n8" href="#fn8">[8]</a> Yet this is almost exactly what Lenin's definition of 
socialism as "electrification plus (the political power of the) Soviets" boiled 
down to.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n9" href="#fn9">[9]</a> Academic economists have analyzed the fact that of several 
technically feasible possibilities, certain ones are chosen, and that these 
choices lead to a particular pattern of technology applied in real life, which 
seems to concretize the technique of a given period. [See, for instance, Joan 
Robinson's <u>The Accumulation of Capital</u> (London; 1956; pages 101-178]. But 
in these analyses, the choice is always presented as flowing from considerations 
of "profitability" and, in particular, from the "relative costs of capital and 
labor". This abstract viewpoint has little effect on the reality of industrial 
evolution. Marx, on the other hand, underlines the social content of 
machine-dominated industry, its enslaving function.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n10" href="#fn10">[10]</a> In other words, abilities, know-how, and awareness are 
developed in production.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n11" href="#fn11">[11]</a> Strictly speaking, poetry means creation.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n12" href="#fn12">[12]</a> In J. A. C. Brown's <u>The Social Psychology of Industry</u> 
(Penguin Books, 1954), there is a striking contrast between the devastating 
analysis the author makes of present capitalist production and the only 
"conclusions" he can draw which are pious exhortations to management to "do 
better", to "democratize itself", etc.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n13" href="#fn13">[13]</a> In other words, what we are challenging is the whole concept 
of a technique capable of organizing people from the outside. Such an idea is as 
absurd as the idea of a psychoanalysis in which the patient would not appear, 
and which would be just a "technique" in the hands of the analyst.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n14" href="#fn14">[14]</a> This problem is distinct from that of overall planning. 
General planning is concerned with determining a quantitative framework: so much 
steel and so many hours of labor at one end, so many consumer goods at the 
other. It does not have to intervene in the form or type of the intermediate 
products.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n15" href="#fn15">[15]</a> One might add that the rate of economic growth also depends:</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%">(a) <u>on technical progress</u>. But, such technical progress is 
itself critically dependent on the amounts invested, directly or indirectly, in 
research;</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%">(b) on the evolution of the <u>productivity of labor</u>. But, 
this hinges on the amount of capital invested per worker and on the level of 
technique (which two factors again bring us back to investment). More 
significantly, the productivity of labor depends on the producers' attitude to 
the economy. This, in turn, would center on people's attitude to the plan, on 
how its targets were established, on their own involvement and sense of 
identification with the decisions reached, and, in general, on factors discussed 
in this text.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n16" href="#fn16">[16]</a> Bureaucratic "planning" as carried out in Russia and the 
Eastern European countries proves nothing, one way or the other. It is just as 
irrational and just as wasteful. The waste is both "external" (the wrong 
decisions being taken) and "internal" (brought about by the resistance of the 
workers to production). For further details, see "<i>La revolution proletarienne 
contre la bureaucratie</i>" in <i>Socialisme ou Barbarie</i> (Number 20).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n17" href="#fn17">[17]</a> The field is in constant expansion. However, the starting 
points remain the following:</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%">- Wassily W. Leontief; <u>The Structure of American Economy, 
1919-1939: An Empirical Application of Equilibrium Analysis</u>; Oxford 
University Press (1941, 1951, 1953, 1957, 1966).</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%">- Wassily W. Leontief, et al.; <u>Studies in the Structure of 
American Economy: Theoretical and Empirical Explorations in Input-Output 
Analysis</u>; Harvard University Press (New York: 1953).</p>

Allocation</u> proceedings of a Conference; John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (New York: 
1951).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n19" href="#fn19">[19]</a> The division of the economy into some 100 sectors, which 
roughly corresponds to present computer capacity, is about "halfway" between its 
division (by Marx) into two sectors (consumer goods and means of production) and 
the thousand sectors that would be required to ensure a perfectly exact 
representation. Present computer capabilities would probably be sufficient in 
practice, and could be made more precise, even now, by tackling the problem in 
stages.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n20" href="#fn20">[20]</a> Labor value includes, of course, the actual cost of the 
equipment utilized in the period considered. [For the working out of labor 
values by the matrix method see the article "<i>Sur la dynamique du capitalisme</i>" 
in <i>Socialisme ou Barbarie</i>, Number 12.] The adoption of labor value as a 
yardstick is equivalent to what academic economists call "normal long-term 
costs". The viewpoint expressed in this text corresponds to Marx's, which is in 
general attacked by academic economists, even "socialist" ones. For them, 
"marginal costs" should determine prices. [See for instance: Joan Robinson; 
<u>An Essay on Marxian Economics</u>; Macmillan &amp; Co Ltd (London, 1949); pages 23 
-28.] We can't here go into this discussion. All that we can say is that the 
application of the principle of marginal costs would mean that the price of an 
air ticket between London and New York would at times be zero (when the plane 
was already full) and at times be equivalent to that of the whole aircraft (when 
the plane was empty).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n21" href="#fn21">[21]</a> In his major work on this theme 
&#8211; and after a moderate use of 
differential equations &#8211; Keynes comes up with the conclusion that the main 
determinants of investment are the "animal spirits" of the entrepreneurs (<u>The 
General Theory</u>, pages 161-162). The idea that the volume of investment is 
primarily determined by the rate of interest (and that the latter results from 
the interplay of the "real forces of productivity and thrift") was long ago 
demolished by academic economists themselves (see Joan Robinson's <u>The Rate of 
Interest and Other Essays</u>, 1951).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n22" href="#fn22">[22]</a> One would look in vain through the voluminous writings of Mr. 
Bettelheim for any attempt at justification of the rate of accumulation "chosen" 
by the Russian bureaucracy. The "socialism" of such "theoreticians" doesn't only 
imply that Stalin (or Khrushchev) alone can know. It also implies that such 
knowledge, by its very nature, cannot be communicated to the rest of humanity. 
In another country, and in other times, this was known as the <i>Führer-prinzip</i>.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n23" href="#fn23">[23]</a> This net increase is obviously not just the sum of the 
increases in each sector. Several elements add up or have to be subtracted 
before one can pass from the one to the other. On the one hand, for instance, 
there would be the "intermediate utilizations" of the products of each sector &#8211; 
on the other hand, the "external economies" (investment in a given sector, by 
abolishing a bottleneck, could allow the better use of the productive capacities 
of other sectors, which although already established were being wasted 
hitherto). Working out these net increases presents no particular difficulties. 
They are calculated automatically, at the same time as one works out the 
"intermediate objectives" (mathematically, the solution of one problem 
immediately provides the solution of the other).</p>

<p class="endnote">We have discussed the problem of the global determination of the 
<u>volume</u> of investments. We can only touch on the problem of the <u>choice</u> 
of particular investments. The distribution of investments <u>by sectors</u> is 
automatic once the final investment is determined (such-and-such a level of 
final consumption directly or indirectly implies such-and-such a productive 
capacity in each sector). The choice of a given type of investment from amongst 
several producing the same result could only depend on such considerations as 
the effect that a given type of equipment would have on those who would have to 
use it &#8211; and here, from all we have said, their own viewpoint would be decisive.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n24" href="#fn24">[24]</a> From this angle (and, if they weren't false in the first 
place), Russian figures which show that year-after-year the targets of the plan 
have been fulfilled to 100&nbsp;% would provide the severest possible indictment of 
Russian economy and of Russian society. They would imply, in effect, that during 
a given 5-year period <u>nothing</u> happened in the country, that not a single 
new idea arose in anyone's mind (or else, that Stalin, in his wisdom, had 
foreseen all such ideas and incorporated them in advance in the plan, allowing &#8211; 
in his kindness &#8211; inventors to savor the pleasures of illusory discovery).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n25" href="#fn25">[25]</a> Complex, but by no means insoluble economic problems will 
probably arise in this respect. They boil down to the question of how 
agricultural prices will be determined in a socialist economy. The application 
of <u>uniform</u> prices would maintain important inequalities of revenue 
("differential incomes") between different Rural Communes or even between 
different individuals in a given Commune (because of differences in the 
productivity of holdings, differential soil fertility, etc.). The final solution 
to the problem would require, of course, the complete socialization of 
agriculture. In the meantime, compromises will be necessary. There might perhaps 
be some form of taxation of the wealthier Communes to subsidize the poorer ones 
until the gap between them had been substantially narrowed (completely to 
suppress inequalities by this means would however amount to forcible 
socialization). One should note in passing that differential yields today stem 
in part from the quite artificial working of poor yield soils through subsidies 
paid by the capitalist state for political purposes. Socialist society could 
rapidly lessen these gaps by questioning certain subsidies, while at the same 
time massively helping to equip poor, but potentially viable Communes.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n26" href="#fn26">[26]</a> Although the Russian word "<i>soviet"</i> means "council", 
one should not confuse the Workers' Councils we have been describing in this 
text with even the earliest of Russian Soviets. The Workers' Councils are based 
on the place of work. They can play both a political role, and a role in 
industrial management of production. In its essence, a Workers' Council is a 
universal organism. The 1905 Petrograd Soviet of Workers' Deputies, although the 
product of a general strike and although exclusively proletarian in composition, 
remained a purely political institution. The Soviets of 1917 were, as a rule, 
geographically-based. They, too, were purely political institutions, in which 
all social layers opposed to the old regime would get together (see Trotsky's 
<u>1905</u> and his <u>History of the Russian Revolution</u>). Their role 
corresponded to the "backwardness" of the Russian economy and of Russian society 
at the time. In this sense, they belong to the past. The "normal" form of 
working class representation in the Revolution to come will undoubtedly be the 
Workers' Councils.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n27" href="#fn27">[27]</a> Not in what it hides (the police terror and the concentration 
camps), but in what it officially proclaims, in its Constitution.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n28" href="#fn28">[28]</a> The formation of Workers' Councils of State Employees was one 
of the demands of the Hungarian Workers' Councils.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n29" href="#fn29">[29]</a> Neither the means nor the overall conception of war could be 
copied from those of an imperialist country. What we have said about capitalist 
technology is valid for military technique: there is no neutral military 
technique, there is no "H-bomb for socialism". P. Guillaume has clearly shown 
(in his article, "<i>La Guerre et notre époque</i>", Numbers 3, 5, and 6 of 
<i>Socialisme ou Barbarie</i>) that a proletarian revolution must necessarily draw 
up its own strategy and methods (mainly propaganda) suitable to its social and 
human objectives. The need for "strategic weapons" does not arise for a 
revolutionary power.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n30" href="#fn30">[30]</a> In a country like France, such a Central Assembly of 
Delegates might consist of 1,000 to 2,000 delegates (one delegate per 10,000 or 
20,000 workers). A compromise would have to be reached between two requirements: 
as a working body, the Central Assembly of Delegates should not be too large; on 
the other hand, it must ensure the most direct and most widely-based 
representation of the organisms from which it emanates.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n31" href="#fn31">[31]</a> Plato discusses them at length, and his <u>Protagoras</u> is, 
in part, devoted to them.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n32" href="#fn32">[32]</a> See C. Wright Mills' <u>White Collar</u> (pages 347-348) and 
<u>The Power Elite</u> (New York; 1956; pages 134 sq, 145 sq, etc.) for an 
illustration of the total lack of any relationship between "technical" 
capacities of any kind and current industrial management or political 
leaderships.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n33" href="#fn33">[33]</a> It might be claimed that the problem of numbers remains, and 
that all would never be able to express themselves in the time available. This 
isn't a valid argument. There would rarely be an Assembly of over 20 people 
where everyone wanted to speak, for the very good reason that when there is 
something to be decided there aren't an infinite number of options or an 
infinite number of arguments. In rank-and-file workers' gatherings, convened, 
for instance, to decide on a strike, there are hardly ever "too many" 
interventions. The two or three fundamental opinions having been voiced, and 
various arguments having been exchanged, a decision is soon reached.</p>

<p class="endnote">The length of speeches, moreover, often varies inversely with the 
weight of their content. Russian leaders may speak for four hours at Party 
Congresses and say nothing. The speech of the <i>Ephore</i> which persuaded the 
Spartans to launch the Peloponesian War occupies 21 lines in <i>Thucydides</i> 
(I, 86). For an account of the laconicism of revolutionary assemblies see 
Trotsky's account of the Petrograd Soviet of 1905 &#8211; or accounts of the meetings 
of factory representatives in Budapest in 1956 (<i>Socialisme ou Barbarie</i>, 
Number 21, pages 91-92).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n34" href="#fn34">[34]</a> Televising present parliamentary procedures, on the other 
hand, could be a sure way of driving even further nails into the coffin of this 
institution.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n35" href="#fn35">[35]</a> The basis of parties is not a difference of opinion, as such, 
but differences on fundamentals and the more or less systematic unity of each 
"nexus of views". In other words parties express a general orientation 
corresponding to a more or less clear ideology, in its turn flowing from the 
existence of social positions leading to conflicting aspirations.</p>

<p class="endnote">As long as such positions exist and lead to a political 
"projection" of expectations, one cannot eliminate political groups &#8211; but as 
these particular differences disappear, it is unlikely that groups will be 
formed about "differences" in general.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n36" href="#fn36">[36]</a> All the discussion about "socialism in one country" between 
the Stalinists and the Left Opposition (1924-27) shows to a frightening degree 
how men make history thinking they know what they are doing, yet understand 
nothing about it. Stalin insisted it was possible to build socialism in Russia 
alone, meaning by socialism, industrialization, plus the power of the 
bureaucracy. Trotsky vowed that this was impossible, meaning by socialism, a 
classless society.</p>

<p class="endnote">Both were right in what they said, and wrong in denying the truth 
of the other's allegation. But, neither was talking about socialism. And no one, 
during the whole discussion, mentioned the regime inside Russian factories, the 
relation of the proletariat to the management of production, nor the relation of 
the Bolshevik Party, where the discussion was taking place, to the broad masses, 
who were in the long run, the main interested party in the whole business.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r1" href="#rn1">[1*]</a> The <i>Cornucopia</i> or horn of plenty was a horn overflowing 
with fruit and flowers which, for the Romans, symbolized abundance.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r2" href="#rn2">[2*]</a> Our text is a close (but not always literal) translation of 
the French original. The milieu in which our pamphlet will be distributed and 
discussed differs from that of the 1957 article. Throughout, our main concern 
has been with getting essential concepts over to as wide (and unspecialized) an 
audience as possible. To a great extent, this has influenced our choice of 
wording and sentence structure. Paragraphs have been shortened. A number of 
sectional and chapter headings have been added. Some additional footnotes have 
been inserted (clearly indicated as "<i>Solidarity</i>" footnotes). One or two 
of the original footnotes have been omitted, and one or two others incorporated 
into the text proper, which has been slightly shortened. The diagrams and 
illustrations are our own.</p>

again in print. (25p plus postage.)</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r6" href="#rn6">[6*]</a> The paralyzing effect on the functioning of any segment of 
capitalist society of "working to rule" (i.e., of accepting the rules made by 
those in authority) indirectly illustrated this point.</p>

on the functions of such an "assembly", in a completely self-managed society.</p>

fuller documentation of these experiences.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r9" href="#rn9">[9*]</a> Bernard Shaw once cynically described democracy as 
"substituting election by the incompetent many for appointment by the corrupt 
few".</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r10" href="#rn10">[10*]</a> Those who argue about the "intrinsic merits" of 
decentralization seldom pursue their thoughts to their logical conclusions. Do 
they really envisage every town and every village generating its own electricity 
(or atomic power), arranging its own jet aircraft schedules, importing its own 
tea or sugar, growing its own bananas, or building its own neurosurgical 
centers? Or will the "free" society dispense with these altogether?</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r11" href="#rn11">[11*]</a> We are fully aware that this statement will be taken out of 
context and that we will be accused of standing for the "perpetuation of the 
wage-slavery, etc., etc." For a discussion of the role of money and wages in the 
early stages of socialism, see <a href="#h19">"Money", "Wages", Value</a>. For a discussion of how 
money can readily be abolished from one day to the next, see any utopian 
writings, i.e., any writings in which the author substitutes his/her own wishes 
for tendencies existing here and now, within capitalist society itself. The 
experience of groups which have attempted the immediate abolition of money has 
so far been one of invariable recuperation by established society. Those who had 
taken their wishes for reality have had reality imposed upon their wishes.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r13" href="#rn13">[13*]</a> See the article, <u>The New Proletariat</u> by John King in 
<i>Solidarity</i> (London), Volume VI, Number 1.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r14" href="#rn14">[14*]</a> All the preceding talk of "wages", "prices" and "the market" 
will, for instance, undoubtedly have startled a certain group of readers. We 
would ask them momentarily to curb their emotional responses and to try to think 
rationally with us on the matter.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r15" href="#rn15">[15*]</a> This will probably prove necessary for as long as some kind 
of work proves necessary (i.e., for as long as there is not such vast abundance 
as to allow the immediate and full satisfaction of every conceivable human 
demand). Those who think in terms of a society of immediate abundance, where 
work is unnecessary and where every citizen will forthwith be able to consume 
whatever he wants in terms of goods and services, seldom pause to consider who 
will produce these goods or provide these services, or who will produce the 
machines to produce them.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r16" href="#rn16">[16*]</a> One could also invent new words, if it would make people 
happy, but this would not change the underlying reality.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r17" href="#rn17">[17*]</a> Today, those who can afford it are prepared to travel 
considerable distances to work, often at considerable physical or financial cost 
to themselves, because of the drabness, dirt, smell, or noise of where they 
work. Many others live at a distance just because there is no suitable 
accommodation in the vicinity. How will the new society cope with the horror of 
most modern workplaces? Will it seek to associate workplaces and homes &#8211; or, on 
the contrary, to separate them?</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r18" href="#rn18">[18*]</a> Tanks were used to suppress revolutionary uprisings in Berlin 
in 1953, Hungary in 1956, and Czechoslovakia in 1968. Aircraft were used to bomb 
civilians in the Spanish Civil War. It would be sheer self-deception to blind 
oneself to the likelihood that similar attempts would be made to put down 
revolutionary uprisings in Western Europe or the USA. The main defense of the 
revolution would of course be political, an appeal over the heads of their 
government to the working people of the "enemy" side. But, what if the 
revolutionaries were physically attacked? Should they be prepared to use tanks 
in self-defense? If bombed, would they be entitled to use fighter aircraft or 
bombers to destroy enemy airfields? Single bombers or squadrons of bombers? 
There is a ruthless internal logic in these questions. The collective use of 
tanks or aircraft implies the services to maintain them, and is not a function 
for a local Council, but for some regional or national body. However abhorrent 
this may seem to some libertarians, we see no way out. We would be interested to 
hear of alternative means from those who throw up their hands in horror at our 
suggestions.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r19" href="#rn19">[19*]</a> The task of such bodies would be much easier than it is at 
present. Today, this task usually consists in "re-adapting the deviant" to the 
requirements and values of a destructive and irrational society. In the future, 
it would be to help those still dominated by the old ideology of self-seeking to 
see that their problems can best be tackled in conjunction with others.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r20" href="#rn20">[20*]</a> This occurred when the Social Democrats were in a majority in 
the German Workers' Councils, immediately after the World War I.</p>
