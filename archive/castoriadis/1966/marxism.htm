<h2>Cornelius Castoriadis</h2>
<h1>The Fate of Marxism</h1>
<h3>1966</h3>
<hr>

<p class="information">Between 1961 and 1965 <i>Socialisme ou Barbarie</i> published (in 
its issues 36-40) an important article by Paul Cardan entitled <i>Marxisme et 
Théorie Révolutionnaire</i>. Part I dealt with &#8216;the historical fate of marxism 
and the notion of orthodoxy&#8217; and this pamphlet is based on that section. Part II 
went on to discuss &#8216;the marxist theory of history&#8217;. We published it under the 
title <i>History and Revolution</i> in August 1971. Further sections, not yet 
translated, deal with &#8216;the marxist philosophy of history&#8217;, &#8216;the two elements in 
marxism and what historically became of them&#8217;, &#8216;the balance sheet&#8217;, and &#8216;the 
nature of revolutionary theory&#8217;.</p>

<p class="information">The present text first appeared in Solidarity (London) vol. IV, 
no. 3 (August 1966). A later reprint was produced by Solidarity (Clydeside).</p>

<h3><a name="h1">Which Marxism?</a></h3>

<p class="fst">For anyone seriously concerned with the social question, an 
encounter with marxism is both immediate and inevitable. It is probably even 
wrong to use the word &#8216;encounter&#8217;, in that such a term conveys both something 
external to the observer and something that may or may not happen. Marxism today 
has ceased to be some particular theory or some particular political programme 
advocated by this or that group. It has deeply permeated our language, our ideas 
and the very reality around us. It has become part of the air we breathe in 
coming into the social world. It is part of the historical landscape in the 
backgrounds of our comings and goings.</p>

<p class="fst">For this very reason to speak of marxism has become one of the 
most difficult tasks imaginable. We are involved in the subject matter in a 
hundred different ways. Moreover this Marxism, in realizing itself, has become 
impossible to pin down. For with which marxism should we deal? With the marxism 
of Khruschev or with the marxism of Mao Tse Tung? With the marxism of Togliatti 
or with that of Thorez? With the marxism of Castro, of the Yugoslavs, or of the 
Polish revisionists? Or should one perhaps deal with the marxism of the 
Trotskyists (although here too the claims of geography reassert themselves: 
British and French trotskyists, trotskyists in the United States and trotskyists 
in Latin America tear one another to pieces, mutually denouncing one another as 
non marxist). Or should one deal with the Marxism of the Bordighists or of the 
SPGB, of Raya Dunayevskaya or of CLR James, or of this or that of the still 
smaller group of the extreme &#8216;left&#8217;? As I well known each of these groups 
denounces all others as betraying the spirit of &#8216;true&#8217; marxism which it alone 
apparently embodies. A survey of the whole field will immediately show that 
there is not only the abyss separating &#8216;official&#8217; from &#8216;oppositional&#8217; marxisms. 
There is also the vast multiplicity of both &#8216;official&#8217; and &#8216;oppositional&#8217; varieties 
each seeing itself as excluding all others.</p>

<p class="fst">There is no simple yardstick by which this complex situation 
could be simplified. There is no &#8216;test of events which speaks for itself&#8217;. Both 
the marxist politician enjoying the fruits of office the marxist political 
prisoner find themselves specific social circumstances, and in themselves these 
circumstances confer no particular valid to the particular views of those who 
expound them. On the contrary, particular circumstances makes it essential carefully 
to interpret what various spokesmen for marxism say. Consecration in power gives no 
more validity to what a man says than does the halo of the martyr or 
irreconcilable opponent. For does not marxism itself teach us to view with 
suspicion both what emanates from institutionalized authority and what emanates 
from oppositions that perpetually fail to get even a toe hold in historical 
reality?</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">A Return To The Sources</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The solution to this dilemma cannot be purely and simply a 
&#8216;return to Marx&#8217;. What would such a return imply? Firstly it would see no more, 
in the development of ideas and actions in the last eighty years, and in 
particular in the development of social democracy, leninism, stalinism, 
trotskyism, etc, thann layer upon layer of disfiguring scabs covering a healthy 
body of intact doctrine. This would be most unhistorical.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not only that Marx&#8217;s doctrine is far from having the 
systematic simplicity and logical consistency that certain people would like to 
attribute to it. Nor is it that such a &#8216;return to the sources&#8217; would necessarily 
have something academic about it (at best it could only correctly re-establish 
the theoretical content of a doctrine belonging to the past &#8211; as one might 
attempt to do, say, for the writings of Descartes or St. Thomas Aquinas). Such 
an endeavour could leave the main problem unsolved, namely that of discovering 
the significance of Marxism for contemporary history and for those of us who 
live in the world of today.</p>

<p class="fst">The main reason why a &#8216;return to Marx&#8217; is impossible is that 
under the pretext of faithfulness to Marx &#8211; and in order to achieve this 
faithfulness &#8211; such a &#8216;return&#8217; would have to start by violating one of the 
essential principles enunciated by Marx himself. Marx was, in fact, the first to 
stress that the significance of a theory cannot be grasped independently of the 
historical and social practice which it inspires and initiates, to which it 
gives rise, in which it prolongs itself and under cover of which a given 
practice seeks to justify itself.</p>

<p class="fst">Who, today, would dare proclaim that the only significance of 
Christianity for history is to be found in reading unaltered versions of the 
Gospels or that the historical practice of various Churches over period of some 
2,000 years can teach us nothing fundamental about the significance of this 
religious movement? A &#8216;faithfulness to Marx&#8217; which would see the historical fate 
of marxism as something unimportant would be just as laughable. It would in 
fact be quite ridiculous. Whereas for the Christian the revelations of the 
Gospels have a transcendental and an intemporal validity, no theory could ever 
have such qualities in the eyes of a marxist. To seek to discover the meaning of 
marxism only in what Marx wrote (while keeping quiet about what the doctrine has 
become in history) is to pretend &#8211; in flagrant contradiction with the central 
ideas of that doctrine &#8211; that real history doesn&#8217;t count and that the truth of a 
theory is always and exclusively to be found &#8216;further on&#8217;. It finally comes to 
replacing revolution by revelation and the understanding of events by the 
exegesis of texts.</p>

<p class="fst">All this would be bad enough. But there is worse. The insistence 
that a revolutionary theory be confronted, at all stages, by historical 
reality<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> is explicitly proclaimed in Marx&#8217;s writings. It is in fact part of 
the deepest meaning of Marxism. Marx&#8217;s marxism did not seek to be &#8211; and could 
not be &#8211; just one theory among others. It did not seek to hide its historical 
roots or to dissociate itself from its historical repercussions. Marxism was to 
provide the weapons not only for interpreting the world but for changing it.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> 
The fullest meaning of the theory was, according to the theory itself, that it 
gave rise to and inspired a revolutionary practice. Those who, seeking to 
exculpate marxist theory, proclaim that none of the historical practices which 
for 100 years have claimed to base themselves on marxism are &#8216;really&#8217; based on 
marxism, are in fact reducing marxism to the status of a mere theory, to the 
status of a theory just like any other. They are submitting marxism to an 
irrevocable judgment. They are in fact submitting it, quite literally, to a 
&#8216;Last Judgment&#8217;. For did not Marx thoroughly accept Hegel&#8217;s great idea: 
&#8216;Weltgeschichte ist Weltgericht&#8217;.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">Marxism As Ideology</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Let us look at what happened in real life. In certain stages of 
modern history a practice inspired by marxism has been genuinely revolutionary. 
But in more recent phases of history it has been quite the opposite. And while 
these two phenomena need interpreting (and we will return to them) they 
undoubtedly point to the fundamental ambivalence of marxism. It is important to 
realise that in history, as in politics, the present weighs far more than the 
past. And for us, the present can be summed up in the statement that for the 
last 40 years Marxism has become an <i>ideology</i> in the full meaning that 
Marx himself attributed to this word. It has become a system of ideas which 
relate to reality not in order to clarify it and to transform it, but on the 
contrary in order to mask it and to justify it in the abstract.</p>

<p class="fst">It has become a means of allowing people to say one thing and to 
do another, to appear other than they are.</p>

<p class="fst">In this sense marxism first became ideology when it became 
Establishment dogma in countries paradoxically called &#8216;socialist&#8217;. In these 
countries &#8216;marxism&#8217; is invoked by governments which quite obviously do not 
incarnate working class power and which are no more controlled by the working 
class than is any bourgeois government. In these countries &#8216;marxism&#8217; is 
represented by &#8216;leaders of genius&#8217; &#8211; whom their successors call &#8216;criminal 
lunatics&#8217; without more ado. &#8216;Marxism&#8217; is proclaimed the ideological basis of 
Tito&#8217;s policies <i>and</i> of those of the Albanians, of Russian policies <i>and</i> 
of those of the Chinese. In these countries marxism has become what Marx called 
the &#8216;solemn complement of justification&#8217;. It permits the compulsory teaching of 
&#8216;State and Revolution&#8217; to students, while maintaining the most oppressive and 
rigid state structures known to history. It enables a self-perpetuating and 
privileged bureaucracy to take refuge behind talk of the &#8216;collective ownership 
of the means of production&#8217; and of &#8216;abolition of the profit motive&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst">But marxism has also become ideology in so far as it represents 
the doctrine of the numerous sects, proliferating on the decomposing body of the 
&#8216;official&#8217; marxist movement. For us the word sect is not a term of abuse. It has 
a precise sociological and historical meaning. A small group is not necessarily 
a sect. Marx and Engels did not constitute a sect, even when they were most 
isolated. A sect is a group which blows up into an absolute a single side, 
aspect or phase of the movement from which it developed, makes of this the 
touchstone of the truth of its doctrine (or of the truth, full stop), 
subordinates everything else to this &#8216;truth&#8217; and in order to remain &#8216;faithful&#8217; 
to it is quite prepared totally to separate itself from the real world and 
henceforth to live in a world of its own. The invocation of marxism by the sects 
allows them to think of themselves and to present themselves as something other 
than what they are, namely as the future revolutionary party of that very 
proletariat in which they never succeed in implanting themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally marxism has become ideology in yet another sense. For 
several decades now it has ceased to be a <i>living</i> theory. One could search 
the political literature of the last 30 years in vain even to discover fruitful 
applications of the theory, let alone attempts to extend it or to deepen it.</p>

<p class="fst">We don&#8217;t doubt that what we are now saying will provoke indignant 
protests among those who, while professing to &#8216;defend Marx&#8217;, daily bury his 
corpse a little deeper under the thick layers of their distortions and 
stupidities. We don&#8217;t care. This is no personal quarrel. In analysing the 
historical fate of marxism we are not implying that Marx had any kind of moral 
responsibility for what happened. It is marxism itself, in what was best and 
most revolutionary in it, namely its pityless denounciation of hollow phrases 
and ideologies and its insistence on permanent self-criticism, which compels us 
to take stock of what marxism has become in real life.</p>

<p class="fst">It is no longer possible to maintain or to rediscover some kind 
of &#8216;marxist orthodoxy&#8217;. It can&#8217;t be done in the ludicrous (and ludicrously 
linked) way in which the task is attempted by the high priests of stalinism and 
by the sectarian hermits, who see marxist doctrine which they presume intact, 
but &#8216;amend&#8217;, &#8216;improve&#8217; or &#8216;bring up to date&#8217; on this or that specific point, at 
their convenience. Nor can it be done in the dramatic and ultimatistic way 
suggested by Trotsky in 1940<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> who said, more or less: &#8216;We know that marxism is 
an imperfect theory linked to a given period of history. We know that 
theoretical elaboration should continue. But today, the revolution being on the 
agenda, this task will have to wait&#8217;. This argument is conceivable &#8211; although 
superfluous &#8211; on the eve of an armed insurrection. Uttered a quarter of a 
century later it can only serve to mask the inertia and sterility of the 
trotskyist movement, since the death of it&#8217;s founder.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">A Marxist &#8216;Method&#8217;?</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Some will agree with us so far, but will seek final refuge in the 
defence of a &#8216;marxist method&#8217; allegedly unaffected by what we have just 
discussed. It is not possible, however, to maintain &#8216;orthodoxy&#8217; as Lukacs 
attempted long before them (in 1919 1 precise), by limiting it to a marxist <i>
method</i>, which could somehow be separated from its content and which could 
somehow be neutral in relation to its content.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Although a step forward in relation to various kinds of 
&#8216;orthodox&#8217; cretinism, Lukacs&#8217; position is basically untenable. It is untenable 
for a reason which Lukacs forgets, despite his familiarity with dialectical 
thinking, namely that it is impossible, except if one takes the term &#8216;method&#8217; at 
its most superficial level, to separate a method from its content particularly 
when one is dealing with historical and social theory.</p>

<p class="fst">A method, in the philosophical sense, is defined by the sum total 
of the categories it uses. A rigid distinction between method and content only 
belongs to the more naive forms of transcendental idealism (or &#8216;criticism&#8217;). In 
its early stages this method of thought sought to separate and to oppose matter 
or content (which were infinite and undefined) to certain finite operative 
categories. According to this permanent flux of the subject matter could not 
alter the basic categories which were seen as the form without which the subject 
matter could not be grasped or comprehended.</p>

<p class="fst">But this rigid distinction between material and category is 
already transcended in the more advanced stages of &#8216;criticist&#8217; thought, when it 
comes under the influence of dialectical thought. Formerly the problem arises: 
how do we determine which is the appropriate analytical category for this or 
that type of raw material? If the raw carries within itself the appropriate 
&#8216;hallmark&#8217; allowing it to be placed in this or that it is not just &#8216;amorphous&#8217;; 
and if it is genuinely amorphous then it could indifferently be in one category 
or in another and the distinction between true and false breaks down. It is 
precisely this contradiction which, at several times in the history of 
philosophy, has led from a &#8216;criticist&#8217; type of thinking to thinking of a 
dialectical type.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This is how the question is posed at the level of logic. When one 
considers the growth of knowledge as <i>history</i>, one sees that it was often 
the &#8216;development of the subject matter&#8217; that led to a revision of the previously 
accepted categories or even to their being exploded and superseded. The 
&#8216;philosophical&#8217; revolutions produced in modern physics by relativity theory or 
by quantum theory are just two examples among many.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The impossibility of establishing a rigid separation between 
method and content, between categories and raw material becomes even more 
obvious when one passes from knowledge of the physical world to understanding of 
history. A deeper enquiry into already available material &#8211; or the discovery of 
new material &#8211; may lead to a modification of the categories and therefore of the 
method. But there is, in addition, something much more fundamental, something 
highlighted precisely by Marx and by Lukacs themselves.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> This is the fact that <i>
the categories through which we approach and apprehend history are themselves 
real products of historical development</i>. These categories can only become 
clear and effective methods of historical knowledge when they have to some 
extent become incarnated or fulfilled in <i>real</i> forms of social life.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us give a simple example. In the thinking of the ancient 
Greeks the dominant categories defining social relations and history were 
essentially <i>political</i> (the power of the city, relations between cities, 
relations between &#8216;might&#8217; and &#8216;right&#8217;, etc.). The economy only received marginal 
attention. This was not because the intelligence or insight of the Greeks were 
less &#8216;developed&#8217; than those of modern man. Nor was it because there were no 
economic facts, or because economic facts were totally ignored. It was because 
in the social reality of that particular epoch the economy had not yet become a 
separate, autonomous factor (a factor &#8216;for itself&#8217; as Marx would say) in human 
development. A significant analysis of the economy and of its importance for 
society could only take place in the 17th century and more particularly in the 
18th century. It could only take place in parallel with the real development of 
capitalism which made of the economy the dominant element in social life. The 
central importance attributed by Marx and the marxists to economic factors is 
but an aspect of the unfolding of this historical reality.</p>

<p class="fst">It is therefore clear that there cannot exist a &#8216;method&#8217; of 
approaching history, which could remain immune from the actual development of 
history. This is due to reasons far more profound than the &#8216;progress of 
knowledge&#8217; or than &#8216;new discoveries&#8217; etc. It is due to reasons pertaining 
directly to the very structure of historical knowledge, and first of all to the 
structure of its object: the mode of being of history. What is the object we are 
trying to know when we study history? What is history? History is inseparable 
from meaning. Historical facts are historical (and not natural, or biological) 
inasmuch as they are interwoven with meaning (or sense). The development of the 
historical world is, <i>ipso facto</i>, the development of a universe of meaning. 
Therefore, it is impossible radically to separate fact from meaning (or sense), 
or to draw a sharp logical distinction between the categories we use to 
understand the historical material, and the material itself. And, as this 
universe of meaning provides the environment in which the &#8216;subject&#8217; of the 
historical knowledge (i.e. the student of history) lives, it is also necessarily 
the means by which he grasps, in the first instance, the whole historical 
material. No epoch can grasp history except through its own ideas about history; 
but these ideas are themselves a product of history and part and parcel of the 
historical material (which will be studied as such by the next epoch). Plainly 
speaking the method of the biologist is not a biological phenomenon; but the 
method of the historian is a historical phenomenon<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a>.</p>

<p class="fst">Even these comments have however to be seen in proper 
perspective. They don&#8217;t imply that at every moment, every category and every 
method are thrown into question. Every method is not transcended or ruined by 
the development of real history at the very instant it is being utilized. At any 
given moment, it is always a practical question of knowing if historical change 
has reached a point where the old categories and the old method have to be 
reassessed. But this judgment cannot be made independently of a discussion of 
the content. In fact such an assessment is nothing other than a discussion on 
content which, starting with the old categories, comes to show, through its 
dealings with the raw material of history, that one needs to go beyond a 
particular set of categories.</p>

<p class="fst">Many will say: &#8216;to be marxist is to remain faithful to Marx&#8217;s <i>
method</i>, which remains valid&#8217;. This is tantamount to saying that nothing has 
happened in the history of the last 100 years which either permits one or 
challenges one to question Marx&#8217;s categories. It is tantamount to implying that 
everything will forever be understood by these categories. It is to take up a 
position in relation to content and categories, to have a static, non-dialectical theory concerning this relationship, while at the same time refusing 
openly to admit it.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">Conclusions</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In fact, it is precisely the detailed study content of recent 
history which compelled us to reconsider the categories &#8211; and therefore the 
method of marxism. We have questioned these categories not only (or not so much) 
because this or that particular theory of Marx &#8211; or of traditional marxism &#8211; had 
been proved &#8216;wrong&#8217; in real life, but because we felt that history as we were 
living it could no longer be grasped through these traditional categories, 
either in their original form<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> or as &#8216;amended&#8217; or &#8216;enlarged&#8217; by post-marx 
marxists. The course of history, we felt, could neither be grasped, <i>nor 
changed</i>, by these methods.</p>

<p class="fst">Our reexamination of marxism does not take place in a vacuum. We 
don&#8217;t speak from just anywhere or from nowhere at all. We started from 
revolutionary marxism. But we have now reached the stage where a choice 
confronts us: to remain marxists or to remain revolutionaries. We to choose 
between faithfulness to a doctrine which, for a considerable period now, has no 
longer been animated by any new thought or any meaningful action, and 
faithfulness to our basic purpose revolutionaries, which is a radical and total 
formation of society.</p>

<p class="fst">Such a radical objective requires first of all that one should 
understand that which one seeks to transform. It requires that one identifies 
what elements, in contemporary society, genuine challenge its fundamental 
assumptions and are in basic (and not merely superficial) conflict with its 
present structure. But one must go further. Method is not separable from 
content. Their unity, namely theory, is in its turn not separable from the 
requirements of revolutionary action. And anyone looking at the real world, must 
conclude that meaningful revolutionary action can no longer be guided by 
traditional theory. This has been amply demonstrated for several decades now 
both by the experience of the mass parties of the &#8216;left&#8217;, and by the experience 
of the sects.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n5" href="#fn5">[5]</a> See the essay &#8216;What Is Orthodox Marxism?&#8217; Lukacs&#8217; book 
&#8216;History and Class Consciousness. An English translation of this essay was

Wright Mills adopts a rather similar viewpoint in his book <i>The Marxists</i>.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> The classical example of such a transition is the passage from 
Kant to Hegel, via Fichte and Schelling. But the basic pattern can be discerned 
in the later works of Plato, or among the neo-Kantians, from Rickert to Last.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n7" href="#fn7">[7]</a> It is obviously not just a question of turning things upside 
down. Neither logically nor historically have the categories of physics been 
&#8216;simply a result&#8217; (and even less &#8216;simply a reflection&#8217;) of the subject matter. A 
revolution in the realm of categories may allow one to grasp raw material which 
hitherto defied definition (as happened with Galileo). Moreover advances in 
experimental technique may at times &#8216;compel&#8217; new material to appear. There is 
therefore a two-way relationship &#8211; but certainly no independence &#8211; between 
categories and subject matter.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n9" href="#fn9">[9]</a> These considerations are developed more on p. 20 et seq. of the 
French text.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n10" href="#fn10">[10]</a> In the present article we cannot enter into a detailed 
discussion as to which of the concepts of classical marxism have today to be 
discarded for a real grasp of the nature of the modern world and of the means of 
changing it. The subject is discussed in detail in an article <i>Recommencer la 
Revolution</i> (published in January 1964 in issue No.25 of <i>Socialisme ou 
Barbarie</i>) of which we hope to publish extracts in forthcoming issues.</p>
