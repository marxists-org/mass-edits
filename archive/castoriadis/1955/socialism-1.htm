<h2><a name="h1">[Introduction]</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The ideas set forth in this discussion perhaps will be understood 
more readily if we retrace the route that has led us to them. Indeed, we started 
off from positions in which a militant worker or a Marxist inevitably places 
himself at a certain stage in his development and therefore positions everyone 
we are addressing has shared at one time or another. And if the conceptions set 
forth here have any value at all, their development cannot be the result of 
chance or personal traits but ought to embody an objective logic at work. 
Providing a description of this development, therefore, can only increase the 
reader's understanding of the end result and make it easier for him to check it 
against his experience.[1]</p>

<p class="fst">Like a host of other militants in the vanguard, we began with the 
discovery that the traditional large "working-class" organizations no longer 
have a revolutionary Marxist politics nor do they represent any longer the 
interests of the proletariat. The Marxist arrives at this conclusion by 
comparing the activity of these "socialist" (reformist) or "communist" 
(Stalinist) organizations with his own theory. He sees the so-called Socialist 
parties participating in bourgeois governments, actively repressing strikes or 
movements of colonial peoples, and championing the defense of the capitalist 
fatherland while neglecting even to make reference to a socialist system of 
rule. He sees the Stalinist "Communist" parties sometimes carrying out this same 
opportunistic policy of collaborating with the bourgeoisie and sometimes an 
"extremist" policy, a violent adventurism unrelated to a consistent 
revolutionary strategy. The class-conscious worker makes the same discoveries on 
the level of his working-class experience. He sees the socialists squandering 
their energies trying to moderate his class's economic demands, to make any 
effective action aimed at satisfying these demands impossible, and to substitute 
interminable discussions with the boss or the State for the strike. He sees the 
Stalinists at certain times strictly forbidding strikes (as was the case from 
1945 to 1947) and even trying to curtail them through violence [2] or frustrating 
them underhandedly [3] and at other times trying to horsewhip workers into a strike 
they do not want because they perceive that it is alien to their interests (as 
in 1951-52, with the "anti-American" strikes). Outside the factory, he also sees 
the Socialists and the Communists participate in capitalist governments without 
it changing his lot one bit, and he sees them join forces, in 1936 as well as in 
1945, when his class is ready to act and the regime has its back against the 
wall, in order to stop the movement and save this regime, proclaiming that one 
must "know to end a strike" and that one must "produce first and make economic 
demands later."</p>

<p class="fst">Once they have established this radical opposition between the 
attitude of the traditional organizations and a revolutionary Marxist politics 
expressing the immediate and historical interests of the proletariat, both the 
Marxist and the class-conscious worker might then think that these organizations 
"err" [<i>se trompent</i>] or that they "are betraying us." But to the extent that they reflect on 
the situation, and discover for themselves that socialists and Stalinists behave 
the same way day after day, that they always and everywhere have behaved in this 
way, in the past, today, here, and everywhere else, they begin to see that to 
speak of "betrayal" or "mistakes" does not make any sense. It could be a 
question of "mistakes" only if these parties pursued the goals of the 
proletarian revolution with inadequate means, but these means, applied in a 
coherent and systematic fashion for several dozen years, show simply that the 
goals of these organizations are not our goals, that they express interests 
other than those of the proletariat. Once this is understood, saying that they 
"are betraying us" makes no sense. If, in order to sell his junk, a merchant 
tells me some load of crap and tries to persuade me that it is in my interest to 
buy it, I can say that he is trying to deceive me [<i>il me trompe</i>] but not that he is betraying 
me. Likewise, the Socialist or Stalinist party, in trying to persuade the 
proletariat that it represents its interests, is trying to deceive it but is not 
betraying it; they betrayed it once and for all a long time ago, and since then 
they are not traitors to the working class but faithful and consistent servers of 
other interests. What we need to do is determine whose interests they serve.</p>

<p class="fst">Indeed, this policy does not merely appear consistent in its 
means or in its results. It is embodied in the leadership stratum of these 
organizations or trade unions. The militant quickly learns the hard way that 
this stratum is irremovable, that it survives all defeats, and that it 
perpetuates itself through co-optation. Whether the internal organization of 
these groups is "democratic" (as is the case with the reformists) or dictatorial 
(as is the case with the Stalinists), the mass of militants have absolutely no 
influence over its orientation, which is determined without further appeal by a 
bureaucracy whose stability is never put into question; for even when the 
leadership core should happen to be replaced, it is replaced for the benefit of 
another, no less bureaucratic group.</p>

<p class="fst">At this point, the Marxist and the 
class-conscious worker are almost bound to collide with Trotskyism.[4] Indeed, 
Trotskyism has offered a permanent, step-by-step critique of socialist and 
Stalinist politics for the past quarter century, showing that the defeats of the 
workers' movement <font face="Droid Serif">&#8211;</font> Germany, 1923; China, 1925-27; England 1926; Germany, 1933; 
Austria, 1934; Frances 1936; Spain, 1936-38; France and Italy, 1945-47; etc. &#8211; are due to the policies of the traditional organizations, and that these 
policies have constantly been in breach of Marxism. At the same times Trotskyism 
[5] offers an explanation of the policies of these parties, starting from a 
sociological analysis of their makeup. For reformism, it takes up again the 
interpretation provided by Lenin: The reforming of the socialists expresses the 
interests of a labor aristocracy (since imperialist surplus profits allow the 
latter to be "corrupted" by higher wages) and of a trade union and political 
bureaucracy. As for Stalinism, its policy serves the Russian bureaucracy, this 
parasitic and privileged stratum that has usurped power in the first workers' 
State, thanks to the backward character of the country and the setback suffered 
by the world revolution after 1923.</p>

<p class="fst">We began our critical work, even back when we were within the 
Trotskyist movement, with this problem of Stalinist bureaucracy. Why we began 
with that problem in particular needs no long involved explanations. Whereas the 
problem of reforming seemed to be settled by history, at least on the 
theoretical level, as it became more and more an overt defender of the 
capitalist system,[6] on the most crucial problem of all, that of Stalinism &#8211; which 
is <i>the</i> contemporary problem par excellence and which in practice weighs on us 
more heavily than the first &#8211; the history of our times has disproved again and 
again both the Trotskyist viewpoint and the forecasts that have been derived 
from it. For Trotsky, Stalinist policy is to be explained by the interests of 
the Russian bureaucracy, a product of the degeneration of the October 
Revolution. This bureaucracy has no "reality of its own" historically speaking; 
it is only an "accident" the product of the constantly upset balance between the 
two fundamental forces of modern society, capitalism and the proletariat. Even 
in Russia it is based upon the "conquests of October," which had provided 
socialist bases for the country's economy (nationalization, planning, monopoly 
over foreign trade, etc.) and upon the perpetuation of capitalism in the rest of 
the world; for the restoration of private property in Russia would signify the 
overthrow of the bureaucracy and help bring about the return of the capitalists, 
whereas the spread of the revolution worldwide would destroy Russia's isolation 
&#8211; the economic and political result of which was the bureaucracy and would give 
rise to a new revolutionary explosion of the Russian proletariat, who would 
chase off these usurpers. Hence the necessarily empirical character of Stalinist 
politics, which is obliged to waver between two adversaries and makes its 
objective the utopian maintenance of the status quo; it even is obliged thereby 
to sabotage every proletarian movement any time the latter endangers the 
capitalist system and to overcompensate as well for the results of these acts of 
sabotage with extreme violence every time reactionaries, encouraged by the 
demoralization of the proletariat, try to set up a dictatorship and prepare a 
capitalist crusade against "the remnants of the October conquests." Thus, 
Stalinist parties are condemned to fluctuate between "extremist" adventuress and 
opportunism.</p>

<p class="fst">But neither can these parties nor the Russian bureaucracy remain 
hanging indefinitely in midair like this. In the absence of a revolution, 
Trotsky said, the Stalinist parties would become more and more like the 
reforming parties and more and more attached to the bourgeois order, while the 
Russian bureaucracy would be overthrown with or without foreign intervention so 
as to bring about a restoration of capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky had tied this prognostication to the outcome of the 
Second World War. As is well known, this war disproved it in the most glaring 
terms. The Trotskyist leadership made itself look ridiculous by stating that it 
was just a matter of time. But it had become apparent to us, even before the war 
ended, that it was not and could not have been a question of some kind of time 
lag, but rather of the <i>direction</i> of history, and that Trotsky's entire edifice 
was, down to its very foundations, mythological.</p>

<p class="fst">The Russian bureaucracy underwent the critical test of the war 
and showed it had as much cohesiveness as any other dominant class. If the 
Russian regime admitted of some contradictions, it also exhibited a degree of 
stability no less than that of the American or German regime. The Stalinist 
parties did not go over to the side of the bourgeois order. They have continued 
to follow Russian policy faithfully (apart, of course, from individual 
defections, as take place in all parties): They are partisans of national 
defense in countries allied to the USSR, and adversaries of this kind of defense 
in countries that are enemies of the USSR (we include here the French CP's 
series of turnabouts in 1939, 1941, and 1947). Finally, the most important and 
extraordinary thing was that the Stalinist bureaucracy extended its power into 
other countries; whether it imposed its power on behalf of the Russian army, as 
in most of the satellite countries of Central Europe and the Balkans, or had 
complete domination over a confused mass movement, as in Yugoslavia (or later on 
in China and in Vietnam), it inaugurated in these countries regimes that were in 
every respect similar to the Russian regime (taking into account, of course, 
local conditions). It obviously was ridiculous to describe these regimes as 
degenerated workers' States.[7]</p>

<p class="fst">From then on, therefore, we were obliged to look into what gave 
such stability and opportunities for expansion to the Stalinist bureaucracy, 
both in Russia and elsewhere. To do this, we had to resume the analysis of 
Russia's economic and social system of rule. Once rid of the Trotskyist outlook, 
it was easy to see using the basic categories of Marxism, that Russian society 
is divided into classes, among which the two fundamental ones are the 
bureaucracy and the proletariat. The bureaucracy there plays the role of the 
dominant, exploiting class in the full sense of the term. It is not merely that 
it is a privileged class and that its unproductive consumption absorbs a part of 
the social product comparable to (and probably greater than) that absorbed by 
the unproductive consumption of the bourgeoisie in private capitalist countries. 
It also has sovereign control over how the total social product will be used. It 
does this first of all by determining how the total social product will be 
distributed among wages and surplus value (at the same time that it tries to 
dictate to the workers the lowest wages possible and to extract from them the 
greatest amount of labor possible): next by determining how this surplus value 
will be distributed between its own unproductive consumption and new 
investments, and finally by determining how these investments will be 
distributed among the various sectors of production.</p>

<p class="fst">But the bureaucracy can control how the social product will be 
utilized only because it controls production. Because it manages production at 
the factory level, it always can make the workers produce more for the same 
wage; because it <i>manages</i> production on the societal level, it can decide to 
manufacture cannons and silk rather than housing and cotton. We discover, 
therefore, that the essence, the foundation, of its bureaucratic domination over 
Russian society comes from the fact that it has dominance within the relations 
of production; at the same time, we discover that this same function always has 
been the basis for the domination of one class over society, in other words, at 
every instant the actual essence of class relations in production is the 
antagonistic division of those who participate in the production process into 
two fixed and stable categories, directors and executants. Everything else is 
concerned with the sociological and juridical mechanisms that guarantee the 
stability of the managerial stratum; that is how it is with feudal ownership of 
the land, capitalist private property, or this strange form of private, 
non-personal property ownership that characterizes present-day capitalism; that 
is how it is in Russia with the "Communist Party" the totalitarian dictatorship 
by the organ that expresses the bureaucracy's general interests and that ensures 
that the members of the ruling class are recruited through co-optation on the scale 
of society as a whole.[8]</p>

<p class="fst">It follows that planning and the nationalization of the means of 
production in no way resolve the problem of the class character of the economy, 
nor do they signify the abolition of exploitation; of course, they entail the 
abolition of the former dominant classes, but they do not answer the fundamental 
problem of who now will direct production and how. If a new stratum of 
individuals takes over this function of direction, "all the old rubbish" Marx 
spoke about will quickly reappear, for this stratum will use its managerial 
position to create privileges for itself, it will reinforce its monopoly over 
managerial functions, in this way tending to make its domination more complete 
and more difficult to put into question; it will tend to assure the transmission 
of these privileges to its successors, etc.</p>

<p class="fst">For Trotsky, the bureaucracy is not a ruling class since 
bureaucratic privileges cannot be transmitted by inheritance. But in dealing 
with this argument, we need only recall (1) that hereditary transmission is in no 
way an element necessary to establish the category of "ruling class," and (2) 
that, moreover, it is obvious how, in Russia, membership in the bureaucracy 
(not, of course, in some particular bureaucratic post) can be passed down; a 
measure such as the abolition of free secondary education (laid down in 1936) 
suffices to set up an inexorable sociological mechanism assuring that only the 
children of bureaucrats will be able to enter into the career of being a 
bureaucrat. That, in addition, the bureaucracy might want to try (using 
educational grants or aptitude tests "based upon merits alone") to bring in 
talented people from the proletariat or the peasantry not only does not 
contradict but even confirms its character as an exploiting class: Similar 
mechanisms have always existed in capitalist countries, and their social 
function is to reinvigorate the ruling stratum with new blood, to mitigate in 
part the irrationalities resulting from the hereditary character of managerial 
functions, and to emasculate the exploited classes by corrupting their most 
gifted members.</p>

<p class="fst">It is easy to see that it 
is not a question here of a problem particular to Russia or to the 1920s. For 
the same problem is posed in every modern society, even apart from the 
proletarian revolution; it is just another expression of the process of 
concentration of the forces of production. What, indeed, creates the <i>objective</i> 
possibility for a bureaucratic degeneration of the revolution? It is the 
inexorable movement of the modern economy, under the pressure of technique, 
toward the more and more intense concentration of capital and power, the 
incompatibility of the actual degree of development of the forces of production 
with private property and the market as the way in which business enterprises 
are integrated. This movement is expressed in a host of structural 
transformations in Western capitalist countries, though we cannot dwell upon 
that right now. We need only recall that they are socially incarnated in a new 
bureaucracy, an economic bureaucracy as well as a work-place bureaucracy. Now, 
by making a <i>tabula rasa</i> of private property, of the market, etc., revolution 
<i>can</i> 
&#8211; if it stops at that point &#8211; make the route of total bureaucratic concentration 
easier. We see, therefore, that far from being deprived of its own reality, 
bureaucracy personifies the final stage of capitalist development.</p>

<p class="fst">Since then it has become obvious that the program of the 
socialist revolution and the proletariat's objective no longer could be merely 
the suppression of private property, the nationalization of the means of 
production and planning, but rather <i>workers' management</i> of the economy and of 
power. Returning to the degeneration the Russian revolution, we established that 
on the economic level the Bolshevik party had as its program not <i>workers' 
management</i> but <i>workers' control</i>. This was because the Party, which did not think 
the revolution could immediately be a socialist revolution, did not even pose 
for itself the task of expropriating the capitalists, and therefore thought that 
this latter class would remain as managers in the workplace. Under such 
conditions, the function of workers' control would be to prevent the capitalists 
from organizing to sabotage production, to get control over their profits and 
over the disposition of the product, and to set up a "school" of management for 
the workers. But this sociological monstrosity of a country where the 
proletariat exercises its dictatorship through the instrument of the soviets and 
of the Bolshevik party, and where the capitalists keep their property and 
continue to direct their enterprises, could not last; where the capitalists had 
not fled, they were expelled by the workers, who then took over the management 
of these enterprises.</p>

<p class="fst">This first experience of workers' management only lasted a short 
time; we cannot go into an analysis here of this period of the Russian 
Revolution (which is quite obscure and about which few sources exist),[*] or of the 
factors that determined the rapid changeover of power in the factories into the 
hands of a new managerial stratum. Among these factors are the backward state of 
the country, the proletariat's numerical and cultural weakness, the dilapidated 
condition of the productive apparatus, the long civil war with its unprecedented 
violence, and the international isolation of the revolution. There is one factor 
whose effect during this period we wish to emphasize: In its actions, the 
Bolshevik party's policy was systematically opposed to workers' management and 
tended from the start to set up its own apparatus for directing production, 
solely responsible to the central power, i.e., in the last analysis, to the 
Party. This was done in the in name of efficiency and the overriding necessities 
brought on by the civil war. Whether this policy was the most effective one even 
in the short term is open to question; in any case, in the long run it laid the 
foundations for bureaucracy.</p>

<p class="fst">If the management [<i>direction</i>] of the economy thus eluded the 
proletariat, Lenin thought the essential thing was for the power of the soviets 
to preserve for the workers at least the leadership [<i>direction</i>] of the State. On 
the other hand, he thought that by participating in the management of the 
economy through workers' control, trade unions, and so on, the working class 
would gradually "learn" to manage. Nevertheless, a series of events that cannot 
be retraced here, but that were inevitable quickly made the Bolshevik party's 
domination over the soviets irreversible. From this point onward, the 
proletarian character of the whole system hinged on the proletarian character of 
the Bolshevik party. We could easily show that under such conditions the Party, 
a highly centralized minority with monopoly control over the exercise of power, 
no longer would be able to preserve even its proletarian character (in the 
strong sense of this term), and that it was bound to separate itself from the 
class from which it had arisen. But there is no need to go as far as that. In 
1923, "the Party numbered 50,000 workers and 300,000 functionaries in its total 
of 350,000 members. It no longer was a workers' party but a party of 
workers-turned-functionaries."[9] Bringing together the "elite" of the proletariat, 
the Party had been led to install this elite in the command posts of the economy 
and the State; hence this elite had to be accountable only to the Party itself. 
The working class's "apprenticeship" in management merely signified that a 
certain number of workers, who were learning managerial techniques, left the 
rank and file and passed over to the side of the new bureaucracy. As people's 
social existence determines their consciousness, the Party members were going to 
act from then on, not according to the Bolshevik program, but in terms of their 
concrete situation as privileged managers of the economy and the state. The 
trick has been played, the revolution has died, and if there is something to be 
surprised about, it is rather how long it took for the bureaucracy to 
consolidate its power.[10]</p>

<p class="fst">The conclusions that follow from this brief analysis are clear: 
The program of the socialist revolution can be nothing other than <i>workers' 
management</i>. Workers' management of power, i.e., the power of the masses' 
autonomous organizations (soviets or councils); workers' management of the 
economy, i.e., the producers' direction of production, also organized in 
soviet-style organs. The proletariat's objective cannot be nationalization and 
planning without anything more, because that would signify that the domination 
of society would be handed over to a new stratum of rulers and exploiters; it 
cannot be achieved by handing over power to a party, however revolutionary and 
however proletarian this party might be at the outset, because this party 
inevitably will tend to exercise this power on its own behalf and will be used 
as the nucleus for the crystallization of a new ruling stratum. Indeed, in our 
time the problem of the division of society into classes appears more and more 
in its most direct and naked form, and stripped of all juridical cover, as the 
problem of the division of society into directors and executants. The 
proletarian revolution carries out its historical program only insofar as it 
tends from the very beginning to abolish this division by reabsorbing every 
particular managerial stratum and by <i>collectivizing</i>, or more exactly by 
<i>completely socializing</i>, the functions of direction. The problem of the 
proletariat's historical capacity to achieve a classless society is not the 
problem of its capacity to physically overthrow the exploiters who are in power 
(of this there is no doubt); it is rather the problem of how to positively 
organize a collective, socialized management of production and power. From then 
on it becomes obvious that the realization of socialism on the proletariat's 
behalf by any party or bureaucracy whatsoever is an absurdity, a contradiction 
in terms, a square circle, an underwater bird; socialism is nothing but the 
masses conscious and perpetual self-managerial activity. It becomes equally 
obvious that socialism cannot be objectively inscribed, not even halfway, in any 
law or constitution, in the nationalization of the means of production, or in 
planning, nor even in a "law" instaurating workers' management: If the working 
class cannot manage, no law can give it the power to do so, and if it does 
manage, such a "law" would merely ratify this existing state of affairs.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus, beginning with a critique of the bureaucracy, we have 
succeeded in formulating a positive conception of the content of socialism; 
briefly speaking, "socialism in all its aspects does not signify anything other 
than worker's management of society," and "the working class can free itself 
only by achieving power for itself." The proletariat can carry out the socialist 
revolution only if it acts autonomously, i.e., if it finds in itself both the 
will and the consciousness for the necessary transformation of society. 
Socialism can be neither the fated result of historical development, a violation 
of history by a party of supermen, nor still the application of a program 
derived from a theory that is true in itself. Rather, it is the unleashing of 
the free creative activity of the oppressed masses. Such an unleashing of free 
creative activity is made <i>possible</i> by historical development, and the action of 
a party based on <i>this</i> theory can <i>facilitate</i> it to a tremendous degree.</p>

<p class="fst">Henceforth it is indispensable to develop on every level the 
consequences of this idea.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h2">Marxism and the Idea of the Proletariat's Autonomy</a></h2>

<p class="fst">We must say right off that there is nothing essentially new about 
this conception. Its meaning is the same as Marx's celebrated formulation "The 
emancipation of the workers must be conquered by the workers themselves."[11] It was 
expressed likewise by Trotsky: "socialism, as opposed to capitalism, consciously 
builds itself up." It would be only too easy to pile up quotations of this kind.</p>

<p class="fst">What is new is the will and ability to take this idea in total seriousness while 
drawing out the theoretical as well as the practical implications. This could 
not be done till now, either by us or by the great founders of Marxism. For, on 
the one hand, the necessary historical experience was lacking; the preceding 
analysis shows the tremendous importance the degeneration of the Russian 
Revolution possesses for the clarification of the problem of workers' power. And 
on the other hand, and at a deeper level, revolutionary theory and practice in 
an exploiting society are subjected to a crucial contradiction that results from 
the fact that they belong to this society they are trying to abolish. This 
contradiction is expressed in an infinite number of ways.</p>

<p class="fst">Only one of these ways is of interest to us here. To be 
revolutionary signifies both to think that only the masses in struggle can 
resolve the problem of socialism and not to fold one's arms for all that; it 
means to think that the essential content of the revolution will be given by the 
masses' creative, original, and unforeseeable activity, and to act oneself, 
beginning with a rational analysis of the present with a perspective that 
anticipates the future.[12] In the last analysis, it means to postulate that the 
revolution will signify an overthrow and a tremendous enlargement of our present 
form of rationality and to utilize this same rationality in order to anticipate 
the content of the revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">How this contradiction is relatively resolved and relatively 
posed anew at each stage of the workers' movement up to the ultimate victory of 
the revolution, cannot detain us here; this is the whole problem of the concrete 
dialectic of the historical development of the proletariat's revolutionary 
action and of revolutionary theory. At this time we need only establish that 
there is an intrinsic difficulty in developing a revolutionary theory and 
practice in an exploiting society, and that, insofar as he wants to overcome 
this difficulty, the theoretician &#8211; and, likewise indeed, the militant &#8211; risks 
falling back unconsciously on the terrain of bourgeois thought, and more 
generally on the terrain of the type of thought that issues from an alienated 
society and that has dominated humanity for millennia. Thus, in the face of the 
problems posed by the new historical situations the theoretician often will be 
led to "reduce the unknown to the known," for that is what theoretical activity 
today consists of. He thereby either cannot see that it is a question of a new 
type of problem or, even if he does see that, he can only apply to it solutions 
inherited from the past. Nevertheless, the factors whose revolutionary 
importance he has just recognized or even discovered &#8211; modern technique and the 
activity of the proletariat &#8211; tend not only to create new kinds of solutions but 
to destroy the very terms in which problems previously had been posed. From then 
on, solutions of the traditional type provided by the theoretician will not 
simply be inadequate; insofar as they are adopted (which implies that the 
proletariat too remains under the hold of received ideas) they objectively will 
be the instrument for maintaining the proletariat within the framework of 
exploitation, although perhaps under a different form.</p>

<p class="fst">Marx was aware of this problem. His refusal of "utopian" 
socialism and his statement that "every step of real movement is more important 
than a dozen Programs", express precisely his distrust of bookish solutions, 
since they are always separate from the living development of history. 
Nevertheless, there remains in Marxism a significant share (which has kept on 
growing in succeeding generations of Marxists) of a bourgeois or "traditional" 
ideological legacy. To this extent, there is an ambiguity in theoretical 
Marxism, an ambiguity that has played an important historical role; the 
exploiting society thereby has been able to exert its influence on the 
proletariat movement from within. The case analyzed earlier, where the Bolshevik 
party in Russia applied traditionally effective solutions to the problem of how 
to direct production, offers a dramatic illustration of this process; 
traditional solutions have been effective in the sense that they effectively 
have brought back the traditional state of affairs, or have led to the 
restoration of exploitation under new forms. Later we will come upon other 
important instances of bourgeois ideas surviving within Marxism. It is useful 
nevertheless to discuss now an example that will bring to light what we are 
trying to say.</p>

<p class="fst">How will labor be remunerated in a socialist economy? It is well 
known that in the "Critique of the Gotha Programme," where he distinguishes the 
organizational form of this post-revolutionary society (the "lower stage of 
communism") from communism itself (where the principle "from each according to 
his abilities, to each according to his needs" would reign), Marx spoke of the 
"bourgeois right" that would prevail during this phase. He understood by that 
equal pay for an equal quantity and quality of labor &#8211; which can mean unequal 
pay for different individuals.[13]</p>

<p class="fst">How can this principle be justified? One begins with the basic 
characteristics of the socialist economy, namely that, on the one hands this 
economy is still an economy of scarcity where, consequently, it is essential 
that the production efforts of society's members be pushed to the maximum; and 
on the other hand, that people still are dominated by the "egoistic" mentality 
inherited from the preceding society and maintained by this state of scarcity. 
The greatest amount of effort in production therefore is required at the same 
time that this society needs to struggle against the "natural" tendency to shirk 
work that still exists at this stage. It will be said, therefore, that it is 
necessary, if one wants to avoid disorder and famine, to make the remuneration 
of labor proportional to the quality and quantity of the labor provided, 
measured, for example, by the number of pieces manufactured, the number of hours 
in attendance, etc., which naturally leads to zero remuneration for zero work 
and in the same stroke settles the problem of one's obligation to work. In 
short, one ends up with some sort of "output-based wage."[14] Depending on how 
clever one is, one will reconcile this conclusion, with greater or lesser ease, 
with the harsh criticism to which this form of wage payment has been subjected 
when it is applied within the capitalist system.</p>

<p class="fst">Doing this, one will have purely and simply forgotten that the 
problem no longer can be posed in these terms: Both modern technique and the 
forms of association among workers that socialism implies render it null and 
void. Whether it is a matter of working on an assembly line or of piecework on 
"individual" machines, the individual laborer's work pace is dictated by the 
work pace of the unit to which he belongs &#8211; automatically and "physically" in 
the case of assembly work, indirectly and "socially" in piecework on a machine, 
but always in a manner that is imposed upon him. Consequently, it longer is a 
problem of individual output.[15] It is a problem of the work pace of a given unit 
of workers (which in the final analysis is the factory unit), and this pace can 
be determined only by this unit of workers itself. The problem of <i>remuneration</i> 
therefore comes down to a <i>management</i> problem, for once a general wage is 
established, the concrete rate of remuneration (the wage-output ratio) will be 
determined by determining the pace of work; the latter in its turn leads us to 
the heart of the problem of management as the problem that concretely concerns 
the producers as a whole (who, in one form or another, will have to determine 
that such and such a production pace on one line of a given type is equivalent 
as an expenditure of labor to another production pace on another line of another 
type, and this will have to done between various shops in the same factory as 
well as between a variety of factories, etc.).</p>

<p class="fst">Let us recall, if need be, that in no way does this signify that 
the problem necessarily becomes any easier to solve. Maybe even the contrary is 
the case. But finally it has been posed in correct terms. Mistakes made while 
trying to solve this problem might be fruitful for the development of socialism, 
and the successive elimination of such mistakes would allow us to arrive at <i>the</i> 
solution. As long as it is posited in the form of an "output-based wage" or 
"bourgeois right," however, we remain situated directly on the terrain of an 
exploiting society.</p>

<p class="fst">Certainly, the problem in its traditional form still can exist in 
"backward sectors" &#8211; though this does not necessarily mean that one should 
provide a "backward" solution. But whatever the solution might be in such a 
case, what we are trying to say is that historical developments tend to change 
both the form and the content of the problem.</p>

<p class="fst">But what is essential is to 
analyze both the mechanism and the mistake. Faced with a problem bequeathed by 
the bourgeois era one reasons like a bourgeois. One reasons like a bourgeois 
first of all in that one sets up an abstract and universal rule &#8211; this being the 
only form in which problems can be solved in an alienated society &#8211; forgetting 
that "law is like an ignorant and crude man" who always repeats the same thing 
[16] 
and that a socialist solution can only be socialist if it is a concrete solution 
that involves the permanent participation of the organized units of workers in 
determining this solution. One also reasons like a bourgeois in that an 
alienated society is obliged to resort to abstract universal rules, because 
otherwise it could not be <i>stable</i> and because it is incapable of taking concrete 
cases into consideration on their own. It has neither the institutions nor the 
point of view necessary for this, whereas a socialist society, which creates 
precisely the organs that can take every concrete case into consideration, can 
have as its law only the perpetual determining activity of these organs.</p>

<p class="fst">One is 
reasoning like the bourgeois in that one accepts the bourgeois idea (and here 
one is correctly reflecting the real situation in bourgeois society) that 
individual interest is the supreme motive of human activity. Thus, for the 
bourgeois mentality of English "neo-socialists," man in socialist society 
continues to be, before all else, an <i>economic man</i>, and society therefore ought 
to be regulated starting out from this idea. Thus transposing at once both the 
problems of capitalism and bourgeois behavior onto the new society, they are in 
essence preoccupied by the problem of incentives (earnings that stimulate the 
worker)[17] and forget that already in capitalist society what makes the worker work 
are not incentives but the control of his work by other people and by the 
machines themselves. The idea of <i>economic man</i> has been created by bourgeois 
society in its image; to be quite exact, in the image of the bourgeois and 
certainly not in the image of the worker. The workers act like "economic men" only when they are obliged to 
do so, i.e., vis-à-vis the bourgeois (who thus makes money off of their 
piecework), but certainly not among themselves (as can be seen during strikes, 
and also in their attitudes toward their families; otherwise, workers would have 
ceased to exist a long time ago). That it may be said that they act in this way 
toward what "belongs" to them (family, class, etc.) is fine, for we are saying 
precisely that they will act in this way toward everything when everything 
"belongs" to them. And to claim that the family is visible and here whereas 
"everything" is an abstraction again would be a misunderstandings for the 
everything we are talking about is concrete, it begins with the other workers in 
the shop, the factory, etc.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h3">Workers' Management of Production</a></h2>

<p class="fst">A society without exploitation is conceivable, we have seen, if 
the management of production no longer is localized in a social category, in 
other words, if the <i>structural</i> division of society into directors and executants 
is abolished. Likewise we have seen that the solution to the problem thus posed 
can be given only by the proletariat itself. It is not only that no solution 
would be of any value, and simply could not even be carried out if it were not 
reinvented by the masses in an autonomous manner, nor is it that the problem 
posed exists on a scale that renders the active cooperation of millions of 
individuals indispensable to its solution. It is that by its very nature the 
solution to the problem of workers' management cannot be fitted into a formula, 
or, as we have said already, it is that the only genuine law socialist society 
acknowledges is the perpetual determining activity of the masses' organs of 
management.</p>

<p class="fst">The reflections that follow, therefore, aim not at "resolving" the 
problem of workers' management theoretically &#8211; which once again would be a 
contradiction in terms &#8211; but rather at clarifying the givens of the problem. We 
aim only at dispelling misunderstandings and widely held prejudices by showing 
how the problem of management is <i>not</i> posed and how it <i>is</i> posed.</p>

<p class="fst">If one thinks the basic task of the revolution is a negative 
task, the abolition of private property (which actually can be achieved by 
decree), one may think of the revolution as centered on the "taking of power" 
and therefore as a <i>moment</i> (which may last a few days and, if need be, can be 
followed by a few months or years of civil war) when the workers seize power and 
expropriate de facto and de jure the factory owners. And in this case, one 
actually will be led to grant a prime importance to "the taking of power" and to 
an organ constructed exclusively with this end in view.</p>

<p class="fst">That in fact is how things happen during a bourgeois revolution. 
The new society is prepared for completely within the old one; manufacturing 
concentrates employers and workers, the rent peasants pay to landed property 
owners is stripped of every economic function as these proprietors are stripped 
of every social function. Only a feudal shell remains around this society that 
is in fact bourgeois. A Bastille is demolished, a few heads cut off, a night 
falls in August, some elected officials (many of whom are lawyers) draft some 
constitutional some laws, and some decrees &#8211; and the trick is played. The 
revolution is over, a historical period is closed, another is opened. True, a 
civil war may follow: The drafting of new codes will take a few years, the 
structure of the administration as well as that of the army will undergo 
significant changes. But the essence of the revolution is over before the 
revolution begins.</p>

<p class="fst">Indeed, the bourgeois revolution is only pure negation as 
concerns the area of economics. It is based upon what already is there, it 
limits itself to erecting into law a state of fact by abolishing a 
superstructure that in itself already is unreal. Its limited constructions 
affect only this superstructure; the economic base takes care of itself. Whether 
this occurs before or after the bourgeois revolution, once established in the 
economic sector, capitalism spreads by the force of its own laws over the 
terrain of simple commercial production that it discovers lying stretched out 
before it.</p>

<p class="fst">There is no relationship between this process and that of the 
socialist revolution. The latter is not a simple negation of certain aspects of 
the order that preceded it; it is essentially <i>positive</i>. It has to construct its 
regime &#8211; constructing not factories but new relations of production for which 
the development of capitalism furnishes merely the presuppositions. We will be 
able to see this better by rereading the passage where Marx describes the 
"Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation." Please excuse us for citing a 
long passage.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"As soon as the capitalist mode of production stands on its own 
feet, then the further socialization of labor and further transformation of the 
land and other means of production into socially exploited and, therefore, 
common means of production, as well as the further expropriation of private 
proprietors, takes a new form. That which is now to be expropriated is no longer 
the laborer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many laborers. 
This expropriation is accomplished by the action of the immanent laws of 
capitalistic production itself, by the centralization of capital. One capitalist 
always kills many. Hand in hand with this centralization, or this expropriation 
of many capitalists by few develop, on an ever-extending scale, the co-operative 
form of the labor-process, the conscious technical application of science, the 
methodical cultivation of the soil, the transformation of the instruments of 
labor into instruments of labor only usable in common, the economizing of all 
means of production by their use as the means of production of combined, 
socialized labor, the entanglement of all peoples in the net of the 
world-market, and with this the international character of the capitalistic 
regime. Along with the constantly diminishing number of the magnates of capital, 
who usurp and monopolize all advantages of this process of transformation, grows 
the mass of miserly oppression, slavery, degradation, exploitation; but with 
this too grows the revolt of the working-class, a class always increasing in 
numbers, and disciplined, united, organized by the very mechanism of the process 
of capitalist production itself. The monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon 
the mode of production, which has sprung up and flourished along with, and under 
it. Centralization of the means of production and socialization of labor at last 
reach a point where they become incompatible with their capitalist integument. 
This integument is burst asunder. The knell of capitalist private property 
sounds. The expropriaters are expropriated."[18]</p>

<p class="fst">What in fact exists of the new society at the moment when the 
"capitalist integument is burst asunder"? All its premises: a society composed 
almost entirely of proletarians, the "rational application of science in 
industry," and also, given the degree of concentration of business enterprises 
this passage presupposes, the separation of property ownership from the actual 
functions of directing production. But where can we find already realized in 
this society socialist relations of productions as bourgeois relations of 
production were in "feudal" society?</p>

<p class="fst">Now, it is obvious that these new relations 
of production cannot be <i>merely</i> those realized in the "socialization of the labor 
process," the cooperation of thousands of individuals within the great 
industrial units of production. For these are the relations of production 
<i>typical</i> of a highly developed form of <i>capitalism</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The "socialization of the 
labor process" as it takes place in the capitalist economy is the premise of 
socialism in that it abolishes anarchy, isolation, dispersion, etc. But it is in 
no way socialism's "prefiguration" or "embryo," in that it is an 
<i>antagonistic</i> 
form of socialization; i.e., it reproduces and deepens the division between the 
mass of executants and a stratum of directors. At the same time the producers 
are subjected to a collective form of discipline, the conditions of production 
are standardized among various sectors and localities, and production tasks 
become interchangeable, we notice at the other pole not only a decreasing number 
of capitalists in a more and more parasitic role but also the constitution of a 
separate apparatus for directing production. Now, socialist relations of 
production are those types of relations that preclude the separate existence of 
a fixed and stable we stratum of directors production. We see, therefore, that 
the point of departure for realizing such relations can be only the destruction 
of the power of the bourgeoisie or the bureaucracy. The capitalist 
transformation of society <i>ends</i> with the bourgeois revolution; the socialist 
transformation of society <i>begins</i> with the proletarian revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">Modern developments themselves have abolished the aspects of the 
problem of management that once were considered decisive. On the one hand, 
managerial labor itself has become a form of wage labor, as Engels already 
pointed out; on the other hand, it has become itself a <i>collective labor of 
execution</i>.[19] The "tasks" involved in the organization of labor, which formerly fell 
to the boss, assisted by a few technicians, now are performed by offices 
bringing together hundreds or thousands of persons, who themselves work as 
salaried, compartmentalized executants. The other group of traditional 
managerial tasks, which basically involve integrating the enterprise into the 
economy as a whole (in particular, those involving market "analysis" or having a 
"flair" for the market &#8211; which pertain to the nature, quality, and price of 
manufactured goods in demand, modifications in the scale of production, etc.), 
already has been transformed in its very nature with the advent of monopolies. 
The way this group of tasks is accomplished has been transformed too, since its 
basics are now carried out by a collective apparatus that canvasses the market, 
surveys consumer tastes, sells the product, etc. All this already has happened 
under monopoly capitalism. When private property gives way to State-run 
property, as in [total] bureaucratic capitalism, a central apparatus for 
coordinating the functioning of enterprises takes the place both of the market 
as "regulator" and of the apparatuses belonging to each enterprise; this is the 
central planning bureaucracy, the economic "necessity" for which should issue, 
according to its defenders, directly from these functions of coordination.</p>

<p class="fst">There is no point in discussing this sophism. Let us simply note 
in passing that the advocates of the bureaucracy demonstrate, in a first move, 
that one can do without bosses since one can make the economy function according 
to a plan and, in a second move, that for the plan to function, it has need of 
bosses of a different kind. For &#8211; and here is what interests us &#8211; the problem of 
how to coordinate the activity of enterprises and sectors of productions after 
the market has been abolished, in other words, the problem of planning, already 
has been virtually abolished by advancements in modern techniques. Leontief 's 
method,[20] even in its present form,[21] removes all "apolitical" or "economic" meaning 
from the problem of how to coordinate various sectors or various enterprises, 
for it allows us to determine the consequences for a entire set of sectors, 
regions, and enterprises once we have settled upon the desired volume of 
production of end-use articles. At the same time, it allows us a large degree of 
flexibility, for this method makes it possible, if we want to modify the plan 
while work is in progress, to draw out immediately the practical implications of 
such a change. Combined with other modern methods,[22] it allows us both to choose 
the optimal methods for achieving our overall objectives, once they are settled 
upon, and to define these methods in detail for the entire economy. Briefly 
speaking, all of the "planning activity" of the Russian bureaucracy, for 
example, could be transferred at this point to an electronic calculator.</p>

<p class="fst">The problem, therefore, appears only at the two extremes of 
economic activity: at the most specific level (how to translate the production 
goal of a particular factory into the production goals to be carried out by each 
group of workers in the shops of this factory) and at the universal level (how 
to determine the production goals for end-use goods of the entire economy).</p>

<p class="fst">In 
both cases, the problem exists only because technique (in the broad sense of 
this term) develops &#8211; and it will develop even more in a socialist society. 
Indeed, it is clear that with an unchanging set of techniques the type of 
solution (if not the solutions themselves, whose exact terms will vary if, for 
example, there is accumulation) would be given once and for all, and that it 
would be merely a matter of allocating tasks within a shop (perfectly compatible 
with the possibility of interchangeable producers being able to switch between 
different jobs) or of determining the end-use products. The incessant 
modification of the different possible ways of carrying out production along 
with the incessant modification of final objectives will create the terrain on 
which collective management will work itself out.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h4">Alienation in Capitalist Society</a></h2>

<p class="fst">By alienation &#8211; a characteristic moment of every class society, but 
one that appears to an incomparably greater extent and depth in capitalist 
society &#8211; we mean to say that the products of man's activity (whether we are 
talking about objects or institutions) take on an independent social existence 
opposite him. Instead of being dominated by him, these products dominate him. 
Alienation is that which is opposed to man's free creativity in the world 
created by man; it is not an independent historical principle having its own 
source. It is the objectification of human activity insofar as it escapes its 
author without its author being able to escape it. Every form of alienation is a 
form of human objectification; i.e., it has its source in human activity (there 
are no "secret forces" in history, any there is a cunning of reason in natural 
economic laws). But not every form of objectification is necessarily a form of 
alienation insofar as it can be consciously taken up again, reaffirmed or 
destroyed. As soon as it is posited, every product of human activity (even a 
purely internal attitude) "escapes its author" and even leads an existence 
independent of that author. We cannot act as if we have not uttered some 
particular word, but we can cease to be determined by it. The past life of every 
individual is its objectification till today; but he is not necessarily and 
exhaustively alienated from it, his future is not permanently dominated by his 
past. Socialism will be the abolition of alienation in that it will permit the 
perpetuate conscious recovery without violent conflict of the socially givens in 
that it will restore people's domination over the products of their activity. 
Capitalist society is an alienated society in that its transformations take 
place independently of people's will and consciousness (including those of the 
dominant class), according to quasi-"laws" that express objective structures 
independent of their control.</p>

<p class="fst">What interests us here is not to describe how alienation is 
produced in the form of alienation in capitalist society (which would involve an 
analysis of the birth of capitalism as well as of its functioning) but to show 
the concrete manifestations of this alienation in various spheres of social 
activity as well as their intimate unity.</p>

<p class="fst">Only to the extent that we grasp the content of socialism as the 
proletariat's autonomy, as free creative activity determining itself, as 
workers' management in all domains, can we grasp the essence of man's alienation 
in capitalist society. Indeed, it is not by accident that "enlightened" members 
of the bourgeoisie as well as reformist and Stalinist bureaucrats want to reduce 
the evils of capitalism to essentially economic evils, and, on the economic 
level, to exploitation in the form of an unequal distribution of national 
income. To the extent that their critique of capitalism is extended to other 
domains it again will take for its point of departure this unequal distribution 
of income, and it will consist basically of variations on the theme of the 
corrupting influence of money. If they look at the family or the sexual 
question, they will talk about how poverty makes prostitutes, about the young 
girl sold to the rich old man, about domestic problems that are the result of 
economic misery. If they look at culture, they will talk about venality, about 
obstacles put in the way of talented but underprivileged people, and about 
illiteracy. Certainly, all that is true, and important. But it only touches the 
surface of the problem, and those who talk only in this way regard man solely as 
a consumer and, by pretending to satisfy him on this levels they tend to reduce 
him to his (direct or sublimated) physical functions of digestion. But for man, 
what is at stake is not "ingestion" [23] pure and simple; rather it is a matter of 
self-expression and self-creation, and not only in the economic domain, but in 
all domains.</p>

<p class="fst">In class society, conflict is not expressed simply in the area of 
distribution, in the form of exploitation and limitations on consumption. This 
is only one aspect of the conflict and not the most important one. Its 
fundamental feature is to be found in the limitations placed on man's human role 
in the domain of production; eventually, these limitations go so far as an 
attempt to abolish this role completely. It is to be found in the fact that man 
is expropriated, both individually and collectively, from having command over 
his own activity. By his enslavement to the machine, and through the machine, to 
an abstract, foreign, and hostile will, man is deprived of the true content of 
his human activity, the conscious transformation of the natural world. It 
constantly inhibits his deep-seated tendency to realize himself in the object. 
The true signification of this situation is not only that the producers live it 
as an absolute misfortune, as a permanent mutilation; it is that this situation 
creates at the profoundest level of production a perpetual conflict, which 
explodes at least on occasion; it also is that it makes for huge wastefulness &#8211; in comparison to which the wastefulness involved in crises of overproduction is 
probably negligible &#8211; both through the producers' positive opposition to a 
system they reject and through the lost opportunities that result from 
neutralizing the inventiveness and creativity of millions of individuals. Beyond 
these features, we must ask ourselves to what extent the further development of 
capitalist production is possible, even "technically," if the direct producer 
continues to be kept in the compartmentalized state in which he currently 
resides.</p>

<p class="fst">But alienation in capitalist society is not simply economic. It 
not only manifests itself in connection with material life. It also affects in a 
fundamental way both man's sexual and his cultural functions.</p>

<p class="fst">Indeed, society 
exists only insofar as there exists an organization of production and 
reproduction of the life of individuals and of the species &#8211; therefore an 
organization of economic and sexual relations &#8211; and only insofar as this 
organization ceases to be simply instinctual and becomes conscious &#8211; therefore 
only insofar as it includes the moment of culture.</p>

<p class="fst">As Marx said, "A bee puts to shame many an architect in the 
construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the 
best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination 
before he erects it in reality."[24] Technique and consciousness obviously go hand in 
hand: An instrument is a materialized and operative signification, or better 
yet a mediation between a deliberate intention and a still-ideal goal.</p>

<p class="fst">What is said in this quotation from Marx about the fabrication of 
bees' honeycombs can be said as well about their "social" organization. As 
technique represents a rationalization of relations with the natural world, 
social organization represents a rationalization of the relations between 
individuals of a group. Bee-hive organization is a non-conscious form of 
rationalization, but tribal organization is a conscious one; the primitive can 
describe it and he can deny it (by transgressing it). Rationalization in this 
context obviously does not mean "our" rationalization. At one stage and in a 
given context, both magic and cannibalism represent rationalizations (without 
quotation marks).</p>

<p class="fst">If, therefore, a social organization is antagonistic, it will 
tend to be so both on the level of production and on the sexual and cultural 
planes as well. It is wrong to think that conflict in the domain of production 
"creates" or "determines" a secondary or derivative conflict on other planes; 
the structures of class domination impose themselves right away on all three 
levels at once and are impossible and inconceivable outside of this 
simultaneity, of this equivalence. Exploitation, for example, can be guaranteed 
only if the producers are expropriated from the management of production, but 
this expropriation both presupposes that the producers tend to be separated from 
the <i>ability</i> to manage &#8211; and therefore from culture &#8211; and reproduces this 
separation on an larger scale. Likewise, a society in which the fundamental 
inter-human relations are relations of domination presupposes and at the same 
time engenders an alienating organization of sexual relations, namely an 
organization that creates in individuals deep-seated inhibitions that tend to 
make them accept authority, etc.[25]</p>

<p class="fst">Indeed, there obviously is a dialectical equivalence between 
social structures and the "psychological" structures of individuals. From his 
first steps in life the individual is subjected to a constant set of pressures 
aimed at imposing on him a given attitude toward work, sex, ideas, at cheating 
him out of [<i>frustrer</i>] the natural objects of his activity and at inhibiting him 
by making him interiorize and value this process of frustration. Class society 
can exist only insofar as it succeeds to a large extent in enforcing this 
acceptance. This is why the conflict is not a purely external conflict, but is 
transposed into the hearts of individuals themselves. This antagonistic social 
structure corresponds to an antagonistic structure within individuals, each 
perpetually reproducing itself by means of the other. The point of these 
considerations is not only to emphasize the moment of identity in the essence of 
the relations of domination as they take place in the capitalist factory, in the 
patriarchal family, or in authoritarian teaching and "aristocratic" culture. It 
is to point out that the socialist revolution necessarily will have to embrace 
all domains in their entirety, and this must be done not it some unforeseeable 
future and "by increments," but rather from the outset. Certainly it has to begin 
in a certain fashion, which can be nothing other than the destruction of the 
power of the exploiters by the power of the armed masses and the installation of 
workers' management in production. But it will have to grapple immediately with 
the reconstruction of other social activities, under penalty of death. We will 
try to show this by looking at what kind of relations the proletariat, once in 
power, will entertain with culture.</p>

<p class="fst">The antagonistic structure of cultural relations in present-day 
society is expressed also (but in no way exclusively) by the radical division 
between manual and intellectual labor. The result is that the immense majority 
of humanity is totally separated from culture as <i>activity</i> and shares [<i>participe</i>] 
in only an infinitesimal fraction of the fruits of culture. On the other hand, 
the division of society into directors and executants becomes more and more 
homologous to the division between manual labor and intellectual labor (all 
management jobs being some form of intellectual labor and all manual jobs being 
some form of labor that consists of the execution of tasks).[26] Workers' management 
is possible, therefore, only if from the outset it starts moving in the 
direction of overcoming this division, in particular with respect to 
intellectual labor as it relates to the production process. This implies in turn 
that the proletariat will begin to appropriate culture for itself. Certainly not 
as ready-made culture, as the assimilation of the "results" of historically 
extant culture. Beyond a certain point, such an assimilation is both impossible 
in the immediate future and superfluous (as concerns what is of interest to us 
here). Rather as appropriation of activity, as recovery of the cultural function 
itself and as a radical change in the producing masses' relation to intellectual 
work. Only as this change takes hold will workers' management become 
irreversible.</p>
