<p class="fst">We are pleased to bring our readers a further instalment, in 
English, of <i>Marxisme et Théorie Révolutionnaire</i> by Cornelius Castoriadis 
(Paul Cardan). The original French text appeared (between 1961 and 1964) in 
issues 36-40 of the now defunct journal <i>Sociallsme ou Barbarie</i>. The first 
chapter of <i>Marxisme et Théorie Revolutionnaire</i> (&#8216;La situation historique 
du marxisme et la question d'orthodoxie&#8217;) was first published in English by 
Solidarity (London) in 1966 (vol. IV, no. 3) under the title <i>The Fate of 
Marxism.</i> It was later reprinted as a pamphlet. We published the second 
chapter (&#8217;La théorie Marxiste de l'histoire&#8217;) in 1971, calling it &#8216;History and 
Revolution&#8217;. The pamphlet in your hands consists of chapters 3 and 4 (entitled 
respectively &#8216;La philosophie Marxiste de l'histoire&#8217; and &#8216;Les deux elements du 
Marxisme et leur destin historique&#8217;).</p>

<p class="fst">Further sections of this article are currently being translated. 
The present text can easily be read on its own. The overall argument (the 
critique of Marxist theory - and of the very concept of a theory of this kind - 
and the positing of the elements of an alternative way of looking at things) can 
best be grasped, however, by reference to <i>L'Institution Imaginaire de la 
Société</i> (Editions du Seuil, Paris 1975). <i>Marxisme et Théorie 
Révolutionnaire</i> constitutes the opening chapters of this book. The title 
(and several of the sub-headings) of this pamphlet are, we must stress, entirely 
our own.</p>

<h2><a name="h1">Introduction</a></h2>

<p class="inline">&#8216;All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient 
and venerable prejudices and opinions are swept away, all new formed ones become 
antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, and all 
that is holy is profaned...&#8217;<i><br>
</i>K. Marx and F. Engels, &#8216;<b>Manifesto of the Communist Party</b>&#8216;, 1848.</p>

<p class="fst">These words are even truer today than when written, 130 years 
ago. In the 19th century the idea of progress was self-evident: the body of 
scientific knowledge grew and grew and rapidly became incorporated into the 
fabric of expanding capitalism. In the 1890&#8217;s some physicists even predicted 
that all there was to know about the universe would soon be within their grasp. 
The figure of 20 years was bandied about. Great &#8216;unifying&#8217; theories were being 
thrown up: Clerk-Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, the Universal Theory of 
Gravitation, Mendeleyev's Periodic Table of the Elements, Darwin's theory of the 
Origin of Species through Natural Selection. The great intellectual edifice of 
19th century science was an imposing counterpoint to the remorseless surge of 
the industrial revolution, which during this period was changing the face of 
Western Europe. Technology seemed omnipotent. The bourgeoisie had dethroned God 
and instituted the realm of Reason. It believed that everything was inherently 
rational, determinable, quantifiable (it had to be, in order to be bought and 
sold).</p>

<p class="fst">This was the science that the founders of &#8216;scientific socialism&#8217; 
had sucked into their bones: the science of elegant universalism, of 
cosmological laws to which there were no exceptions, of systems that would 
encompass the whole of reality in their net. The very structure of this kind of 
thinking reflected the confident ambitions of capitalism in full development. In 
the air was the promise that life itself would soon be amenable to the same 
mathematical manipulations that had successfully predicted the motions of the 
stars, the combination of atoms and the propagation of light.</p>

<p class="fst">It is scarcely surprising that, as an offshoot or extension of 
bourgeois objectivist rationalism, a grand theory of history and social change 
(namely Marxism) was also to emerge, based on the methodological premises and 
impregnated with the scientific euphoria of the 19th century. This particular 
setting &#8216;provided both the bricks and mortar for such a theory ... largely 
pre-determining even what were to be its dominant categories&#8217;. The economy 
seemed the obvious basis of all social relations, and was solemnly theorised as 
such. The techniques of capitalist production were consecrated as scientifically 
inevitable although criticism was levied at how the product was distributed. 
Capitalist models of organisation and efficiency were imported into the radical 
movement. Under the guise of revolutionary theory, an ideology was born and was 
to develop, the ideology of a bureaucracy whose ascendancy was still in the 
future.</p>

<p class="fst">Bourgeois historians were by no means immune from this movement. 
They started asserting that their subject was &#8216;a science, no less and no more&#8217; 
and as such they were necessarily obliged to meet the &#8216;scientific demand for 
completeness and certainty&#8217;<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> As E. 
P. Cheyney succinctly put it: &#8216;History, the great course of human affairs, has 
been the result not of voluntary action on the part of individuals or groups of 
individuals, much less of chance, but has been subject to law&#8217;.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> 
The task of the historian was no longer even to attempt to discover &#8216;what 
actually happened&#8217; but rather to discover those laws.</p>

<p class="fst">Science, however, did not stop in the 19th century. Since the 
turn of the century it has undergone a series of major revolutions. Its texture 
and content are radically different today from what they were a few decades ago. 
The uncertainty principle seems here to stay. The effects of the observer on the 
&#8216;thing&#8217; observed are noted in field after field. The inter-reactions of systems 
are now a topic for study, rather than predictions concerning the position or 
behaviour of their individual components. The non-hierarchical units of 
ecological systems are more relevant to us today than studies of linear 
progressions leading from simple to more complex unicellular organisms, from 
these to multi-cellular forms of life and from the latter right &#8216;up&#8217; to the 
summits of biological evolution inhabited by human kind.</p>

<p class="fst">Scientific insights today both reflect deep changes in prevailing 
philosophy and help further to deepen them. A part, it would appear, from 
revolutionary theory, everything today is up for re-examination. Additional 
knowledge is no longer automatically equated with progress.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> 
Scientists are increasingly questioning the methods and structure of science, 
its rigid separation of the subjective from the objective, its equating of 
technology with advance (not to mention the ways it misuses knowledge). But the 
advocates of &#8216;scientific&#8217; socialism spare themselves these doubts. They ignore 
this process of self-questioning. The &#8216;science&#8217; of their &#8216;scientific socialism&#8217; 
seems immune from the crisis of science as a whole. Many such people start 
striving to change the course of history only after becoming convinced that the 
direction of history is independent of their will! They see history as a train 
running along a track, an analogy drawn - oh, so tellingly and revealingly - 
from the industrial revolution. Some would prefer a &#8216;freer&#8217; metaphor, perhaps 
that of a torrent (at times in flood, at times a trickle), earthbound certainly 
by the laws of gravity, but within those limits able to circumvent or remove 
obstacles, and certainly capable, when necessary, of shaping its own bed and 
even of changing it. But this metaphor too, basing itself as it does on the 
phenomena of natural science, bears the imprint - and has all the limitations - 
of a period.</p>

<p class="sub">*</p>

<p class="fst">Objections to Marxism, at a coherently argued level, usually come 
from two main sources: from downright reactionaries defending the existing 
social order or from the methodological nit-pickers of the academic 
establishment, more concerned with point-scoring (or with the public display of 
their erudition) than with a genuine understanding of the world around them. It 
is rare today to find a philosophical critique of Marx coming from those who, 
like him, seek radically to transform society. A thought out critique that is 
both libertarian and revolutionary, and that moreover identifies Marxism as a 
useful philosophy for the bureaucracy, is rarer still. The need for such an 
approach is now obvious.</p>

<p class="fst">Revolutionaries must challenge the dominant ideology, in whatever 
guise it may present itself. If Marxism now provides the philosophical 
cornerstone of new hierarchical and exploitative regimes, it is a relevant 
target for us. Philosophical ideas and assumptions are as much part of what 
holds these new societies together as are institutional violence, policemen and 
- ultimately - the armed forces of the state. A challenge of this kind is a 
legitimate endeavour. The seeds of new social orders always sprout, as 
philosophical assumptions, long before the revolution. (The revolutionary 
bureaucrat, incidentally, also appears before the revolution) Philosophical 
ideas contribute to the intellectual climate which helps shape societies. The 
Enlightenment preceded the French Revolution: the bourgeoisie won its 
philosophical battles against the aristocracy and the clergy long before it 
secured its own political ascendancy. Bourgeois society is today in crisis. In 
the wings are the Marxists: the ideologues of the bureaucracy.</p>

<p class="fst">Marxist assumptions today permeate the thinking of those who see 
themselves as the midwives of new societies. There are plenty of examples of 
what these assumptions are tending to produce, and have in fact already 
produced. We refuse to believe that these creations are all &#8216;historical 
accidents&#8217; (no society can be that accident-prone). Our century is littered with 
&#8216;revolutions&#8217; which gave birth to authoritarian and repressive regimes, 
officially upholding Marx's ideas, even teaching them in schools and 
universities. These regimes are obsessed with such notions as &#8216;scientific 
socialism&#8217; and &#8216;the unfettered development of the productive forces&#8217;. Many have 
by and large achieved such demands of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> (1848) as &#8216;the centralisation of credit&#8217; or &#8216;the means of communication and transport in the 
hands of the state&#8217;. &#8216;The extension of factories and instruments of production&#8217;, 
owned by the same state, is nowadays taken for granted by all &#8216;progressive&#8217; 
regimes.</p>

<p class="fst">But the future is not settled. The libertarian revolution is not 
a utopian project. In this perspective the unseating of authority, especially of 
so-called &#8216;revolutionary&#8217; authority, is an act of liberation. For objectivist 
rationalism applied to history is tantamount to purging history of all that is 
creative and alive (and therefore unpredictable) within it. Genuine creation is 
the act of producing that which is <i>not</i> totally implicit in the previous state of 
affairs. Such creation plays a major role in history. By its very nature it 
defies the dictates of pre-determination. For those who see history as the 
unfurling of a dialectical process which leads inevitably &#8216;forward&#8217; towards a 
particular brand of &#8216;socialism&#8217; (or which grants history - as sole alternative - 
the right to stagnate in capitalist barbarism) there is no <i>real</i> history. There 
are just mechanisms. There is no more history in such an outlook than there is 
in a chemical reaction (however explosive) produced by mixing ingredients of 
known composition, with known properties, in the appropriate proportions, and in 
the right sequence.</p>

<p class="fst">What areas of choice does history offer us? If there are none, 
are we merely acting out a drama scripted by Him, Her, It or They? Whether the 
agency be the bearded God of the Christians, the imageless God of the 
Judeo-Muslims, the Mother-Goddess of early civilisations<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a>, 
Hegel's Logos, or the Unfurling of the Materialist Dialectic (leading to the 
inevitable emergence of communist humanity) matters little in this respect. Can 
rationalism (&#8216;the ratio of all we have already known&#8217;, as Blake once put it) 
fully forecast the creations we have yet to make? If it can, there is nothing 
original in anything we do. If it cannot, then the power of rationalism has 
certain inherent limitations. If a &#8216;scientific&#8217; theory of history can predict 
history, there is no such thing as genuine choice. If it cannot, then 
&#8216;scientific&#8217; interpretations of the past are subject to the same limitations as 
similar predictions of the future.</p>

<p class="fst">Castoriadis&#8217; critique of &#8216;rationalism&#8217; does not throw reason out 
of the window. It merely challenges its omnipotence and seeks to define its 
limits. Nor does his critique of objectivism deny that phenomena exist 
independently of the human mind. It merely stresses that the human mind moulds 
what it perceives, endowing it with signification. At the level of natural 
phenomena, new interpretations lead to new exploration. At the level of social 
phenomena, the human mind shapes new attitudes, new roles and eventually new 
institutions. The critique of what Marx himself (in <i>The German Ideology</i>) was to 
call &#8216;the tyranny of concepts&#8217; is deeply subversive. The struggle against &#8216;all 
that is&#8217; now forces revolutionaries to rethink issues long considered &#8216;settled 
&#8216;, rescuing in the process the term &#8216;praxis&#8217; (creative and self-transforming 
activity) from its widespread confusion with &#8216;practice&#8217; (the application of 
rationality to concrete tasks). Against this background it is not really 
surprising that the philosophical ideas of Karl Marx should be deemed ripe for 
re-examination. This critique of &#8216;all fixed, fast-frozen relations&#8217; is, after 
all, only an aspect of the intellectual climate of our time.</p>

<h2><a name="h2">The Marxist Philosophy of History</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The Marxist theory of history claims in the first place to be 
scientific, i.e., to be a generalisation susceptible to validation or challenge 
at the level of empirical research. As a scientific theory, which it undoubtedly 
is, it was inevitable that it should share the fate of every important such 
theory. Having produced an enormous and irreversible upheaval in our way of 
looking at the historical world, it is itself overtaken by the research it has 
unleashed and must find its place in the history of theories. This does not 
minimise what it bequeaths. One can say then, like Che Guevara, that it is no 
more necessary today to proclaim that one is a Marxist than it is necessary to 
assert that one is a Pasteurian or a Newtonian - provided we know exactly what 
we mean thereby. Everyone is a Newtonian, in the sense that nobody would return 
to the way of posing problems, or to the categories people used before Newton. 
But at the same time, no one is really a Newtonian, for no one can just go on 
defending a theory that is purely and simply <i>false</i>.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But at the roots of the Marxist theory of history there is a 
philosophy of history profoundly and contradictorily woven into it, and itself 
full of contradictions as we shall see. This philosophy is neither ornament nor 
complement: it is the very foundation of the theory. It is just as much the 
basis of how Marxism looks at past history as of its current political 
conceptions and of its perspectives and programme for revolution. The essential 
thing is that it is a rationalist philosophy. And, like all rationalist 
philosophies, the Marxist philosophy of history provides itself, in advance, 
with the answers to all the problems it raises.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">Objectivist rationalism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The Marxist philosophy of history is first and foremost an 
example of objectivist rationalism. We see it already when Marxism seeks to 
tackle the past. The object studied is seen as a natural object: the model 
applied to it is analogous to models drawn from the natural sciences. Forces, 
acting at defined points, produce predetermined results according to a great 
schema of causality which has to explain the statics of history as well as its 
dynamics, the structure and the functioning of each society as well as the 
instability and upheavals that will lead history to produce new forms. Past 
history is thus rational, in the sense that everything that happened in it 
happened in accordance with perfectly adequate causes, penetrable by our reason, 
as it stood in 1859. According to this theory, the real is perfectly explicable. 
In principle, it is already explained. (One can write monographs on the economic 
causes of the birth of Islam in the 7th century: these will &#8216;verify&#8217; the 
materialist conception of history but will teach us nothing about it.) 
Humanity's past conforms to reason. Everything in it has a definite reason, and 
together these reasons constitute a coherent and exhaustive system.</p>

<p class="fst">But future history is just as rational. It will carry reason into 
effect, and this time in a second sense: in the sense not only of the fact 
itself but of the value attached to it. Future history will be what it ought to 
be. It will witness the birth of a rational society which will embody the 
aspirations of humanity, where mankind will finally be human - that is its 
existence will coincide with its essence and its effective will realise its 
concept.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, history is rational in a third sense: that of the link 
between the past and the future, of facts which will necessarily become values, 
of this set of blind quasi-natural laws which blindly generate the least blind 
situation of all: that of liberated humanity. The reason immanent in all things 
will produce a society miraculously in keeping with our own reason.</p>

<p class="fst">We can see, in all this, that Hegelianism is not really 
transcended. All that is real, and all that will be real, is and will be 
rational. That Hegel stops this reality and this rationality at the point in 
time when his own philosophy appears on the scene, while Marx prolongs them 
indefinitely up to and into communist humanity, does not invalidate what we say. 
It reinforces it. The empire of reason which, in Hegel's case, embraced (by a 
necessary speculative postulate) all that is already given, now extends to 
encompass all that can ever be given in history. The fact that what can be <i>said</i> 
now concerning the future becomes increasingly vague the further one moves from 
the present is due to contingent limitations to our knowledge - and even more to 
the fact that today's tasks are on today's agenda and that they do not include 
&#8216;providing recipes for the socialist cookshops of the future&#8217;. But this future 
is already fixed in its principles: it will be liberty, just as the present is - 
and the past was - necessity.</p>

<p class="fst">There is therefore a &#8216;Cunning of Reason&#8217;, as old Hegel used to 
say. There is a Reason at work in history which ensures that past history is 
comprehensible, that future history is desirable, and that the apparently blind 
necessity of facts is secretly arranged in such a way as to give birth to what 
is good.</p>

<p class="fst">Just stating this idea is enough to shed light on the 
extraordinary number of problems which it masks. We can only deal with some of 
them, and that briefly.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">Determinism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">To claim that past history is comprehensible, as does the Marxist 
conception of history, is to say that there exists in history a causal 
determinism without &#8216;important&#8217; exceptions.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> 
It is also to claim that this determinism carries - at one remove, so to speak - 
meanings linked together in totalities which are themselves bearers of meaning. 
Neither of these ideas can be accepted without further discussion.</p>

<p class="fst">We certainly cannot think of history without reference to the 
category of causality. Contrary to what the idealist philosophers said, history 
<i>is</i> the area par excellence where causality makes sense to us: for it assumes 
there, at the very outset, the form of motivation. We can therefore understand 
the &#8216;causal&#8217; concatenation in it, something we can never do in the case of 
natural phenomena. An electric current makes the bulb glow. The law of gravity 
causes the moon to be in such and such a place in the sky at such and such a 
time. These are, and for us will always remain, external connexions: necessary, 
predictable, but incomprehensible. But if A treads on B's toes, B swears at him, 
and A responds with blows, we understand the necessity of the links even if we 
consider them contingent. (We can reproach the participants for having let 
themselves be carried away when they should have controlled themselves - while 
we know all the time, from our own experience, that at certain moments one 
cannot stop oneself from being carried away.) More generally, we constantly 
think and act out our lives (and envisage that of others) in terms of causality 
- whether it be in terms of motivation or of the choice of the indispensable 
technical means; whether it be that a result is achieved because one has 
deliberately created the conditions of its achievement or whether it be that 
there are inevitable, even if unwanted, effects from one's actions.</p>

<p class="fst">The causal exists in social and historical life because there is 
&#8216;a subjective rationality&#8217;: the deployment of Carthaginian troops at Cannes (and 
their victory) flows from a rational plan devised by Hannibal. The causal also 
exists because there is an &#8216;objective rationality&#8217;, because natural causal 
relations and purely logical necessities are constantly present in historical 
relations: under certain technical and economic conditions, steel production and 
coal extraction stand in a constant and quantifiable relationship to one another 
(more generally, in a functional relationship). And there is also a &#8216;raw 
causality&#8217; which we can perceive without being able to reduce it to subjective 
or objective rational relationships. There are established correlations of which 
we do not know the foundations, regularities of behaviour, individual or social, 
which remain just facts.</p>

<p class="fst">The existence of these causal relations of various kinds allows 
us - beyond a simple understanding of the behaviour of individuals and of its 
regularity - to gather these behaviour patterns together into &#8216;laws&#8217; and to give 
to these laws an abstract expression, from which the &#8216;real&#8217; content of the 
behaviour of living individuals has been eliminated. These laws can then provide 
a basis for satisfactory predictions (verifiable to a given degree of 
probability). For example, there is in the economic functioning of capitalism an 
extraordinary number of observable and measurable regularities. As a first 
approximation we may call them &#8216;laws&#8217;. They ensure that in many of its aspects 
this functioning seems both explainable and comprehensible and that it is, up to 
a point, predictable. Even beyond the economy, there are a number of partial 
&#8216;objective dynamics&#8217;. We find it impossible, however, to integrate these into a 
total determinism of the system, and that for reasons quite different from those 
that express the crisis of determinism in modern physics. It is not that 
determinism collapses or becomes problematic at the <i>limits</i> of the system, or 
that cracks develop in the latter. The opposite is rather the case: it is as if 
some aspects, some areas only of society were governed by determinism, while 
themselves bathed in a mass of non-determinist relations.</p>

<p class="fst">It is important to understand what this impossibility is due to. 
The partial dynamics which we establish are of course incomplete. They 
constantly refer to each other. Any modification of one modifies all the others. 
But if this gives rise to immense problems in practice it creates no 
difficulties of principle. In the physical world too relations are only valid 
&#8216;all other things being equal&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst">The impossibility we are discussing does not stem from the 
complexity of the social material, it arises from its very nature. It stems from 
the fact that the social (or the historical) contain the non-causal as an 
essential ingredient.</p>

<p class="fst">This non-causal appears at two levels. The first, which is the 
least important to us here, is that of deviations between the real behaviour of 
individuals and their &#8216;typical&#8217; behaviour. This introduces an unpredictable 
element. But it would not, as such, prevent the problems from being tackled in a 
determinist way, at least at an aggregate level. If these deviations are 
systematic they can themselves be subjected to causal investigation. If they are 
random, they can be treated statistically. The unpredictability of the movement 
of individual molecules has not prevented the kinetic theory of gases from being 
one of the most rigorous branches of physics. It is in fact this very individual 
unpredictability which generates the extraordinary power of the theory.</p>

<p class="fst">But the non-causal also appears at another level, and it is this 
one which is important. It appears not simply as unpredictable behaviour but as 
<i>creative</i> behaviour, the creative behaviour of individuals, groups, classes, 
whole societies. It asserts itself not as a simple deviation from the prevailing 
type but as the <i>positing</i> of new behaviour patterns, as the <i>institution</i> of new 
social rules, as the <i>invention</i> of a new object or form - in short, as an 
emergence or creation which cannot be deduced from what was there before, as a 
conclusion which exceeds the premises or as a positing of new premises. It has 
already been noted that living beings go beyond the realm of simple mechanism 
because they are capable of giving new answers in new situations. But the 
historical being exceeds the merely biological (or living) being because he can 
give new responses to the <i>same</i> situations, or create new situations.</p>

<p class="fst">History cannot be thought of according to the determinist schema 
(or, indeed, according to any simple &#8216;dialectical&#8217; schema) because it is the 
realm of <i>creation</i>. We shall take up this point again later.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">The chain of meanings and the &#8216;cunning of reason&#8217;</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Beyond the problem of determinism in history lies the problem of 
&#8216;historical&#8217; significations. In the first instance history appears as the scene 
of the conscious actions of conscious beings. But this obviousness collapses as 
soon as we examine it more closely. We then find, with Engels, that &#8216;history is 
the realm of conscious intentions and unwanted ends&#8217;. The <i>real</i> results of 
historical action are practically never those which their performers had 
intended. That isn't, perhaps, so hard to understand. What creates a central 
problem is that these results, which no one had wanted as such, present 
themselves as &#8216;coherent&#8217; in a certain way. They possess a &#8216;signification&#8217; and 
seem to obey a logic which is neither a &#8216;subjective&#8217; logic (carried by a 
consciousness, or posited by someone), nor an &#8216;objective&#8217; logic, like the one we 
believe we detect in nature. We shall call it an historical logic.</p>

<p class="fst">Hundreds of bourgeois, visited or not by the spirit of Calvin, or 
struck by notions of this-worldly asceticism, begin to accumulate. Thousands of 
ruined craftsmen and starving peasants find themselves available to enter the 
factories. Someone invents a steam engine, someone else a new weaving loom. 
Philosophers and physicists seek to conceptualise the universe as a gigantic 
machine and to discover its laws. Kings continue to impose their authority on - 
and simultaneously to emasculate - the nobility. They create national 
institutions. Each of the individuals and groups in question pursues his own 
ends. No one aims at the social totality as such.</p>

<p class="fst">The result however is of a quite different order: it is 
capitalism. It is quite immaterial, in this context, that the result might have 
been totally determined by the causes and conditions, taken as a whole. Let us 
admit, for the sake of argument, that one can show for each of these facts (up 
to and including the colour of Colbert's breeches) all the multi-dimensional 
causal connexions linking them to one another, and linking all of them to the 
&#8216;initial conditions of the system&#8217;. What is important here is that their outcome 
has a coherence which no person or thing wanted or could guarantee to start with 
- or subsequently. The result has a signification (or rather appears to embody a 
virtually inexhaustible system of significations), so that there is well and 
truly a sort of historical entity that is the capitalist system.</p>

<p class="fst">This signification appears in many ways. Through all the causal 
connexions and beyond them it confers a sort of unity upon the features of 
capitalist society and enables us to recognise immediately, in a particular 
phenomenon, a phenomenon of <i>this</i> culture. It allows us immediately to classify 
as belonging to this period objects, books, instruments, phrases of which we 
might know nothing else, and to exclude from this culture, just as immediately, 
a host of other objects. It appears as the simultaneous existence of an infinite 
set of possibilities, and of an infinite set of impossibilities given, so to 
speak, from the outset. It appears moreover in the fact that all which happens 
within the system is not only produced according to something we might call the 
&#8216;spirit of the system &#8216;, but contributes to reinforce it (even when it opposes 
the system and seeks - at the limit - to overthrow it as a real order).</p>

<p class="fst">Everything happens as if this overall signification of the system 
was given, in some way, in advance, as if it &#8216;predetermined&#8217; and over-determined 
the causal sequences and links, subjecting them to itself, compelling them to 
produce results compatible with an &#8216;intention&#8217; which, of course, is no more than 
a metaphorical expression, given that it is no one's intention. Marx says 
somewhere that &#8216;if there was no element of chance, history would be magic&#8217; - a 
profoundly true phrase. But the astonishing thing is that chance itself, in 
history, takes on most of the time the form of meaningful chance, of &#8216;objective&#8217; 
chance. The &#8216;by chance, no doubt&#8217; of popular irony captures it very well. What 
is it that gives to the innumerable gestures, actions, thoughts, individual and 
collective behaviour patterns which make up a society this overall unity of a 
particular world, where a certain order (an order of meaning, not necessarily an 
order of causes and effects) can always be found woven into the texture of 
chaos? What gives great historical events that appearance, which is more than 
appearance, of an admirably thought out and directed tragedy. At times it seems 
as if the obvious errors of the actors could not in any way stop the result 
being achieved; as if the &#8216;internal logic&#8217; of the process was capable of 
inventing and producing, at the desired moment, the &#8216;stops&#8217; and the &#8216;go's&#8217;, all 
the corrections and all the &#8216;special effects&#8217; necessary for the process to 
proceed to its conclusion. And at other times the actor, till now infallible, 
makes the one and only mistake in his life, in its turn indispensable to produce 
the &#8216;aimed at&#8217; result.</p>

<p class="fst">This signification, already other than that actually lived 
through the particular acts of given individuals, poses, as such, an altogether 
inexhaustible problem. For the significant cannot be reduced to the causal. The 
significant builds up an order of concatenations which are separate from and yet 
inextricably woven into the concatenations of causality.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h6">Coherence in society</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Let us consider for example the question of the <i>coherence</i> of a 
given society - be it a primitive society or a capitalist one. What is it that 
ensures that this society &#8216;holds together&#8217;? What is it that ensures that the 
rules (legal or moral) which regulate the behaviour of its adults are in keeping 
with their motivations, and that they are not only compatible but deeply and 
mysteriously related to the society's method of work and production? How is it 
that all this, in turn, corresponds to the structure of the family, to how 
mothers breastfeed their infants, to weaning, to the bringing up of children? 
How is it that there is a definite structure of the human personality in that 
particular culture, including its particular neuroses (and no others) - and that 
all this coordinates itself with one world-view, one religion, such and such a 
manner of eating or of dancing? When studying a primitive society<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> 
one sometimes has the giddy impression that a team of psychoanalysts, 
economists, sociologists, etc., of superhuman capacity and knowledge, has worked 
in advance on the problem of its coherence, has made laws setting out the rules 
that would ensure it. Even if our ethnologists, while analysing the functions of 
such a society and revealing it to us, introduce more coherence than there 
actually is, this impression is not, and cannot be, totally illusory. After all, 
these societies function. They are stable. They are even self-stabilising and 
capable of absorbing important shocks (except, obviously, that of contact with 
&#8216;civilisation&#8217;).</p>

<p class="fst">To be sure, the mystery of this coherence can be vastly reduced 
through causal considerations. This is what is involved in the &#8216;exact&#8217; study of 
a society. If adults behave in a certain fashion, it is because they were 
brought up in a certain way; if the religion of a people contains such and such 
an element, it is because it corresponds to the &#8216;basic personality&#8217; of the 
culture in question; if the authority relations are organised in a particular 
way, this is due to these particular economic factors, or vice versa, etc. But 
this causal reduction does not exhaust the problem, it only gradually strips it 
to the bone. The links which it detects, for instance, are those between 
individual acts situated in a predefined framework. The framework is both that 
of a social life already coherent at any moment as a concrete totality<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> 
(for without such a coherence there would be no individual acts), and of a 
collection of rules both explicit and implicit, of an organisation, of a 
structure which is at one and the same time both an aspect of this totality and 
something different from it. The rules are themselves the product, in some 
respects, of that social life. In a number of instances (hardly ever in 
primitive societies, more often in the case of historical societies) we can 
insert their emergence into a pattern of social causation (for example free 
competition and the abolition of serfdom, introduced by the bourgeoisie, serve 
the ends of the bourgeoisie and are explicitly desired for this reason). But 
even when one succeeds in &#8216;producing&#8217; the rules in such a manner, the fact 
remains that their authors were not, and could not have been, conscious of the 
totality of their results and of their implications - and yet these results and 
implications were inexplicably &#8216;harmonised&#8217; with what already existed or with 
what others were producing, at the same time, in other areas of the social 
scene.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> In most instances, 
conscious &#8216;authors&#8217; quite simply did not exist. The evolution of forms of family 
life, fundamental to the understanding of all cultures, did not depend on 
explicit legislative acts. Still less did such acts stem from an awareness of 
obscure psychoanalytical mechanisms at work in the family. There also remains 
the fact that these rules are given at the point of departure of each society<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> 
and that they are coherent with each other, whatever the distance between the 
areas they cover.</p>

<p class="fst">(When we talk of coherence in this context, we take the word in 
its widest possible sense: for a given society even crisis and being torn apart 
can, in a certain way, be manifestations of coherence, for they are inserted in 
<i>its</i> functioning. They are never followed by a total collapse, by a pure and 
simple atomisation. They are <i>its</i> crises and <i>its</i> incoherence. The great 
depression of 1929, like the two world wars, is entirely &#8216;coherent&#8217; 
manifestations of capitalism. It is not simply that they are integrated into its 
concatenations of causality, but also that they promote the functioning, <i>qua</i> 
functioning, of the system. In their very meaninglessness we can still see in 
many ways the meaning of capitalism.)</p>

<p class="fst">There is a second reduction we can apply. There is no reason to 
be surprised if all current and past societies are coherent. By definition, only 
coherent societies are observable. Non-coherent societies would have collapsed 
immediately and we wouldn't be able to talk about them. This idea, important as 
it is, does not put an end to the discussion either. It would only enable us to 
&#8216;understand&#8217; the coherence of the societies we are looking at by reference to a 
process of &#8216;trial and error &#8216;, whereby only viable societies would have survived 
by some sort of natural selection. But already in biology, where evolution has 
many millions of years at its disposal and where there is an infinitely rich 
process of contingent variations, natural selection through trial and error does 
not seem a sufficient answer to the problem of the origin of species. &#8216;Viable&#8217; 
forms seem to be produced far more often that the statistical probability of 
their appearance would predict. In history, this reference to random variations 
and to a process of selection seems gratuitous. Besides, the problem is posed at 
a previous level (in biology, too): the disappearance of peoples and nations 
described by Herodotus may well have been the outcome of their encounter with 
other peoples who crushed or absorbed them; nevertheless the former already had 
an organised and coherent way of life, which would have continued had not the 
encounter occurred. Anyway, we have seen with our own eyes, literally or 
metaphorically, the birth of new societies and we know things don't happen like 
this. Between the 13th and the 19th century, we don't see an enormous number of 
different types of society appearing in Europe, all of which bar one disappear 
because incapable of surviving. We see a different phenomenon: the birth 
(accidental, in relation to the system preceding it) of the bourgeoisie, which 
through thousands of contradictory ramifications and manifestations, from the 
Lombard bankers to Calvin, and from Giordano Bruno to the use of the compass, 
causes the appearance from the outset of a coherent meaning which will go on 
developing and strengthening itself.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h7">On the Russian Revolution</a></h3>

<p class="fst">These considerations allow one to grasp a second aspect of the 
problem. It isn't only in the structure of a society that we see how a system of 
significations imposes itself upon a network of causes. We see it also in the 
<i>succession</i> of historical societies or, more simply, in each historical process. 
Let us look, for instance, at the process, already touched upon, whereby the 
bourgeoisie emerged. Or better still, let us look at one we think we know so 
well, which led first to the Russian Revolution of 1917, and subsequently to the 
power of the bureaucracy.</p>

<p class="fst">It isn't possible here, and it is hardly necessary, to recall the 
causes deep at work in Russian society which were leading it towards a second 
violent social crisis after that of 1905, and which were allocating roles to the 
main actors of the dram a in the person of the basic classes of society. It 
doesn't seem difficult for us to understand that Russian society was pregnant 
with revolution, or that in this revolution the working class was going to play 
a decisive role. We won't dwell on it. But this comprehensible necessity remains 
&#8216;sociological&#8217; and abstract. It has to be manifested through definite processes. 
It must embody itself in acts (or omissions) dated and signed by particular 
individuals and groups, ending up with the appropriate result. Necessity has 
also to find combined, at the outset, a mass of conditions whose presence wasn't 
always guaranteed by the very factors which generated the &#8216;general necessity&#8217; of 
revolution. One aspect of the question, a minor one if you like but which allows 
one to see easily and clearly what we are driving at, is that of the role of 
individuals. Trotsky, in his <i>History of the Russian Revolution</i>, certainly 
doesn't neglect it. He is himself sometimes seized with an astonishment, which 
he conveys to his readers, when confronted with the perfect adequacy of the 
character of people for the &#8216;historic roles&#8217; they will be called upon to play. 
He is also struck by the fact that when the situation &#8216;demands&#8217; a person of a 
given type, this person somehow emerges (one recalls the parallels he draws 
between Nicholas II and Louis XVI, between the Tsarina and Marie Antoinette).</p>

<p class="fst">What then is the key to this mystery? Trotsky's answer still seem 
sociological: everything in the life and historical existence of a decadent 
privileged class leads it to produce individuals without ideas and without 
character. If a different type of individual were exceptionally to appear, he 
could do nothing with this particular social fabric, and he could do nothing 
against &#8216;historical necessity&#8217;. On the other hand, everything in the life and 
existence of a revolutionary class tends to produce individuals of hardened 
temperament, with strongly-held opinions. This answer contains without doubt a 
large part of truth. Yet it is not sufficient. Or rather it says both too much 
and not enough. It says too much because it ought to be valid in all cases, 
whereas it is only valid where the revolution has been victorious. Why did the 
Hungarian proletariat only produce as &#8216;hardened&#8217; leader a Bela Kun - for whom 
Trotsky never has enough scornful irony? Why could not the German working class 
recognise - and eventually replace - Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht? Where 
was the French Lenin in 1936?</p>

<p class="fst">To say that in these cases the situation was not ripe for the 
appropriate leaders to appear is precisely to abandon the sociological 
interpretation, which can legitimately lay claim to a certain comprehensibility, 
and to return to the mystery of particular situations which either &#8216;demand&#8217; or 
&#8216;forbid&#8217;. Besides, the situation which ought to forbid sometimes doesn't. For 
half a century now the ruling classes have been able to provide themselves with 
leaders who, whatever their historical role was, have been neither Prince Lvovs 
nor Kerensky's. But the explanation doesn't say enough either, for it cannot 
explain why chance is excluded from the business in the very place where it 
appears to be at work in the most blinding fashion, why chance always operates 
&#8216;in the right direction&#8217;, and why the infinite number of possible events which 
would operate in other directions never materialise. For the revolution to come 
about we need the weakness, flabbiness and inertia of the Tsar. We need the 
character of the Tsarina. We need Rasputin and the absurdities of the Court. We 
need Kerensky and Kornilov. Lenin and Trotsky must return to Petrograd, and for 
this we need a mistaken reasoning on the part of the German General Staff and 
another by the British government, not to mention all the pneumococcal and 
diphtheria bacilli which conscientiously avoided these two persons ever since 
their birth. Trotsky puts the question squarely: without Lenin, would the 
revolution have been completed? After discussing the matter, he tends to answer 
&#8216;no&#8217;. We are inclined to think that he is right, and moreover that one could say 
just as much about Trotsky himself.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> 
But in what sense can we say that the internal necessities of the revolution 
guaranteed the appearance of individuals like Lenin and Trotsky, their survival 
until 1917, and their more than improbable presence in Petrograd at the right 
moment? We are compelled to note that the signification of the revolution 
affirms and completes itself through chains of causes bearing no relationship to 
it, but nonetheless inexplicably bound up with it.</p>

<p class="fst">The emergence of the bureaucracy in Russia after the revolution 
enables us to envisage the problem at yet another level. In this case too, 
analysis lets us see deep and understandable factors at work, upon which we 
can't dwell again here.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> The 
birth of the bureaucracy in Russia was certainly not a chance occurrence. The 
proof is that bureaucratisation has since then increasingly appeared as the 
dominant trend of the modem world. But to understand the bureaucratisation of 
capitalist countries we call upon the tendencies immanent in the organisation of 
production, of the economy and of the state under capitalism. To understand the 
origins of the bureaucracy in Russia, we refer to totally different processes, 
such as the relationship between the revolutionary class and &#8216;its&#8217; party, the 
&#8216;maturity&#8217; of the former and the ideology of the latter. Now, from the 
sociological point of view, there is no doubt that the canonical form of the 
bureaucracy is that which emerges at an advanced stage in the development of 
capitalism. Yet the bureaucracy which first appeared historically was that which 
arose in Russia, on the very morrow of the revolution, on the social and 
material ruins of capitalism; it is even this bureaucracy which, through a 
thousand direct and indirect influences, has strongly induced and accelerated 
the movement towards bureaucratisation within capitalism. Everything happened as 
though the modem world was pregnant with bureaucracy - and that to produce it it 
was ready to bring all grist to its mill, including some which seemed least 
appropriate such as Marxism, the workers&#8217; movement and the proletarian 
revolution.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h8">On retrospective rationalisation</a></h3>

<p class="fst">As with the problem of the coherence of a society, there is here 
again a causal reduction which one can and should operate - and this is 
precisely what an exact and reasoned study of history consists of. But this 
causal reduction, as we have just seen, does not abolish the problem. An 
illusion must then be eliminated: the illusion of retrospective rationalisation. 
The historical material, in which we cannot help seeing links between meanings, 
well defined entities, one might even say a personal aspect - the Peloponnesian 
War, the Spartacus revolt, the Reformation, the French Revolution - has itself 
cast our idea of what historical meaning - or a historical figure - is. These 
particular events have taught us what an event is, and the rationality we later 
detect in them only surprises us because we have forgotten that we had ourselves 
first extracted it from them. When Hegel more or less asserts that Alexander had 
of necessity to die at the age of thirty three, because it was of the essence of 
a hero to die young and that one could not imagine an old Alexander, and when he 
thus builds up an accidental fever into the manifestation of Reason hidden in 
history, we note that our image of what a hero is was precisely forged out of 
the real case of Alexander and other similar ones, and that there is therefore 
nothing surprising if one discovers in the event a form which constituted itself 
for us through the event.</p>

<p class="fst">Similar demystifications are needed in many cases. But even this 
won't exhaust the problem. <i>Firstly</i>, because here too we meet something similar 
to what happens in our knowledge of nature<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a>: 
when one has reduced all that appears rational in the physical world to the 
rationalising activity of the cognisant subject, there still remains the fact 
that this a-rational world should be such that this activity can impinge upon 
it, which excludes its being chaotic. <i>Secondly</i>, because the historical meaning 
(that is to say, a meaning which surpasses the meaning effectively lived and 
carried by individuals) seems truly pre-constituted in the material which 
history offers us. To keep to the aforementioned example, the myth of Achilles 
who also died young (and of numerous other heroes who shared the same fate) was 
not forged on the basis of the example of Alexander (it was rather the other way 
round).<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> The meaning expressed 
by the phrase: &#8216;The hero dies young&#8217; seems from way back to have fascinated 
humanity in spite of - or because of - the absurdity it denotes. Reality seems 
to have provided enough support for it to become &#8216;obvious&#8217;. In the same way the 
myth of the birth of a hero<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> 
presents - throughout very different epochs and in very different cultural 
environments - similar features (features which simultaneously deform and 
reproduce real facts). Ultimately, all myths bear witness to how facts and 
significations are mingled in historical reality long before the rationalising 
consciousness of the historian or of the philosopher appears on the scene. 
<i>Thirdly</i>, because history seems constantly dominated by <i>tendencies</i>, because one 
encounters in it a sort of &#8216;internal logic&#8217; of its processes which confers a 
central place to a signification or complex of significations (we referred 
earlier to the birth and development of the bourgeoisie and of the bureaucracy), 
links with one another causal sequences which have no internal connexion, and 
provides itself with all the necessary &#8216;accidental&#8217; conditions. The first 
surprise one experiences on looking at history is to note that in truth, had 
Cleopatra's nose been shorter, the face of the world would have been changed. 
The second, even greater surprise is to note that these noses did have, most of 
the time, the required dimensions.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h9">The impossible synthesis</a></h3>

<p class="fst">There is therefore a central problem: there are significations 
which go beyond the immediate significations experienced and lived in reality, 
and they are conveyed by causal mechanisms which, in themselves, have no 
signification - or not <i>that</i> particular signification. Sensed by humanity from 
time immemorial, explicitly although metaphorically posited in both myth and 
tragedy (in which necessity takes the form of accident), the problem was clearly 
envisaged by Hegel. But Hegel's answer, namely the &#8216;cunning of Reason&#8217;, which so 
arranges things as to rope into its own historical fulfilment events which 
appear to have no signification, is evidently only a phrase. It resolves 
nothing. And it is ultimately part of the old mumbo-jumbo about the ways of 
Providence.</p>

<p class="fst">With Marxism, the problem becomes even more acute. For Marxism 
simultaneously maintains the notion of significations assignable to events and 
to whole slices of history, asserts more than any other conception the power of 
the internal logic of historical processes, adds up these significations into a 
single, already given, signification for history as a whole (namely the creation 
of communism) - and claims it can totally reduce the level of significations to 
the level of causations. The two poles of the contradiction are thus pushed to 
the limit of their depth, but their synthesis remains purely verbal. When Lukacs 
says (seeking to show that Marx had, in this respect too, solved the problem 
which Hegel could only pose) that &#8216;the &#8220;cunning of reason&#8221; can only be something 
more than mythology if real reason is discovered and shown in a really concrete 
way. It is then a genial explanation for as yet non-conscious phases of 
history&#8217;, he (Lukacs) isn't really saying anything. It is not only that this 
&#8216;real reason shown in a really concrete way&#8217; boils down for Marx to 
technico-economic factors and that the latter are insufficient, at the level of 
causality itself integrally to &#8216;explain&#8217; how the results arose. The question is 
how can technico-economic factors have a rationality which vastly exceeds them? 
How can their operation throughout the whole of history embody a unity of 
signification which is itself the bearer of another unity of signification, 
expressed at another level? It is already to do first violence to the facts to 
transform technico-economic evolution into a &#8216;dialectic of the productive 
forces&#8217;. It is to do violence to them again to superimpose on this dialectic 
another, which produces freedom out of necessity. The third violence is to claim 
that the former can be totally reduced to the latter. Even if communism could 
simply be reduced to the question of the adequate development of productive 
forces, and even if this development flowed inexorably from the functioning of 
objective laws established in all certainty, the mystery would remain total. For 
how could the functioning of blind laws produce a result which, for humanity, 
has both a signification and a positive value?</p>

<p class="fst">Even more precisely and strikingly, this mystery is again 
encountered in the Marxist idea of an objective dynamic of the contradictions of 
capitalism. More precisely, because the idea is buttressed by a specific 
analysis of capitalist economics. More strikingly, because here are added a 
series of negative significations. On the surface the mystery seems to be 
resolved: one shows, in the functioning of the economic system, the 
concatenations of causes and effects which lead the system to its crisis, and 
prepare the crossing to a new social order. In reality the mystery remains 
complete. In accepting the Marxist analysis of the capitalist economy we would 
find ourselves confronted with a unique, coherent and oriented dynamic of 
contradictions, with the chimera represented by a beautiful rationality of the 
irrational, with the philosophical riddle of a world of non-meaning which would 
produce meanings at all levels and would finally fulfil our desires. In fact the 
analysis is false and the projection implicit in its conclusions is obvious. But 
never mind. The riddle exists in actual fact, and Marxism does not solve it, far 
from it. By asserting that everything should be grasped in term s of causation, 
and that at the same time everything should be envisaged in terms of 
signification, by claiming that there is a single and immense causal chain, 
which is at the same time a single and immense concatenation of meanings, 
Marxism exacerbates the two component poles of the riddle to the point of making 
it impossible to think of it rationally.</p>

<p class="fst">Marxism does not therefore transcend the philosophy of history. 
It is merely another philosophy of history. The rationality it seems to extract 
from the facts is a rationality which it actually imposes upon them. The 
&#8216;historical necessity&#8217; of which it speaks (in the usual sense of this 
expression, namely that of a concatenation of facts leading history towards 
progress) in no way differs, philosophically speaking, from Hegelian Reason. In 
both cases one is dealing with a truly theological type of human alienation. A 
communist Providence, which would so have pre-ordained history as to produce our 
freedom, is nevertheless a Providence. In both cases one eliminates the central 
concern of any reflexion: the rationality of the (natural or historical) world, 
by providing oneself in advance with a rationally constructed world. Clearly, 
nothing can be resolved in this way: a totally rational world would, by virtue 
of this very fact, be infinitely more mysterious than the world in which we 
struggle. A history that would be rational from beginning to end - and through 
and through - would be more massively incomprehensible than the history we know. 
Its whole rationality would be founded on a total irrationality, for it would be 
in the nature of pure fact, and of fact so brutal, solid and all-embracing that 
we should suffocate under it. Finally, under these conditions, the main problem 
of praxis would disappear, namely that people have to give to their individual 
and collective lives a signification which is not pre-assigned, and that they 
have to do so while at grips with real conditions which neither exclude nor 
guarantee the fulfilment of their project.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h10">Dialectic and &#8216;materialism&#8217;</a></h3>

<p class="fst">When Marx's rationalism takes on an explicit philosophical 
expression, it is presented as a dialectic. Not as a dialectic in general but as 
Hegelian dialectic, shorn of its &#8216;mystified idealist form&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst">Generations of Marxists have thus mechanically parroted Marx's 
phrase: &#8216;with Hegel, the dialectic was standing on its head; I replaced it on 
its feet&#8217;, without asking themselves whether such an operation was actually 
feasible, and especially whether it would be able to transform the nature of its 
object. Is it enough to turn a thing upside down to change its substance? Was 
the &#8216;content&#8217; of Hegelianism so loosely linked to its dialectical &#8216;method&#8217; that 
one could substitute another content radically opposed to it? And could one do 
this to a philosophy which proclaimed that its content was &#8216;produced&#8217; by its 
method, or rather that method and content were but two moments in the production 
of the system?</p>

<p class="fst">It is obviously impossible. If Marx retained the Hegelian 
dialectic he also retained its real philosophical content, which was 
rationalism. He only modified the garment which, &#8216;idealist&#8217; in Hegel becomes 
&#8216;materialist&#8217; in Marx. Using the words in this way, we are only playing with 
them.</p>

<p class="fst">A closed dialectic such as that of Hegel is of necessity 
rationalist. It simultaneously presupposes and &#8216;proves&#8217; that all experience is 
exhaustively reducible to rational determinations. (That moreover these 
determinations are found each time miraculously to coincide with the &#8216;reason&#8217; of 
such and such a thinker or society, that there is consequently at the core of 
all rationalism an anthropocentrism or socio-centrism, that in other words all 
rationalism erects as Reason a particular reason, is plainly evident and would 
already be enough to put an end to the discussion.) A closed dialectic is the 
necessary end of all speculative and systematic philosophy which seeks to answer 
the question: &#8216;how can we have true knowledge?&#8217; And which conceives of truth as 
a complete system of relations without ambiguity or residue. It matters little 
in this respect if its rationalism takes on an &#8216;objectivist&#8217; form (as with Marx 
and Engels) or a &#8216;subjectivist&#8217; form (as with the German idealist philosophers, 
including ultimately even Hegel). In the &#8216;objectivist&#8217; form, where the world is 
rational in itself, a system of laws governs without limit an absolutely neutral 
substratum and our grasp of these laws flows from the (truly incomprehensible) 
fact that our knowledge reflects reality. In the &#8216;subjectivist&#8217; form the world 
in question (in fact the universe of discourse) is the product of the activity 
of the subject, which thereby guarantees its rationality.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Conversely, any rationalist dialectic is necessarily a closed 
dialectic. Without this closure the whole system remains suspended in mid air. 
The &#8216;truth&#8217; of each determination is nothing more than the return to the 
totality of determinations, without which return each moment of the system 
remains both arbitrary and indefinite. One must therefore posit the totality, 
without residue. Nothing must remain outside it, otherwise the system is not 
incomplete it is nothing at all. Any systematic dialectic must lead to an &#8216;end 
of history&#8217;, be it in the form of Hegel's absolute knowledge or of Marx's 
&#8216;complete man&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst">The essence of the Hegelian dialectic is not to be found in the 
assertion that the &#8216;logos&#8217; (the organisation of intelligible appearances) 
&#8216;precedes&#8217; nature, still less in the vocabulary which forms its &#8216;theological 
vestment&#8217;. It lies in the method itself, in the fundamental postulate according 
to which &#8216;all that is real is rational&#8217;, in the inevitable claim that it can 
produce all the possible determinations of its object. This essence cannot be 
destroyed by putting the dialectic &#8216;back on its feet&#8217; since it will always 
remain visibly the same animal. A revolutionary transcendence of Hegelian 
dialectics demands not that it be put back on its feet, but that, as a first 
step, its head be chopped off.</p>

<p class="fst">The nature and meaning of Hegel's dialectic cannot therefore 
change because one starts calling &#8216;matter&#8217; what was previously called &#8216;logos&#8217; or 
&#8216;spirit&#8217; - provided that by &#8216;spirit&#8217; one doesn't mean a white bearded gentleman 
dwelling in heaven, and provided one knows that &#8216;material nature&#8217; is not a mass 
of coloured objects, solid to the touch. It is quite irrelevant in this respect 
to say that nature is one moment of the logos, or that the logos arises at a 
given stage in the evolution of matter, since in both cases the two entities are 
posited from the onset as being of the same essence, to wit, of rational 
essence. Besides, neither of these assertions had any meaning since no one can 
state what spirit is, or what matter is, except through definitions that are 
essentially empty because essentially nominal: matter (or spirit) is all that 
which is, etc. Matter and spirit, in these philosophies, are nothing ultimately 
but pure Being, that is to say as Hegel correctly put it, pure Nothingness. To 
call oneself a &#8216;materialist&#8217; is in no way different from calling oneself an 
&#8216;idealist&#8217; if, by matter, one understands an otherwise indefinable entity, 
exhaustively submitted to laws co-substantial and coextensive with our reason, 
and thus from this very moment <i>de jure</i> penetrable by us (and even <i>de 
facto</i>, since the &#8216;laws of these laws&#8217;, the &#8216;supreme principles of nature and 
knowledge&#8217; are already known here and now: they are the &#8216;principles&#8217; or &#8216;laws of 
dialectics&#8217; discovered 150 years ago (and now even numbered, thanks to the 
efforts of Comrade Mao Tse-Tung). When an &#8216;idealist&#8217; astronomer like Sir James 
Jeans claims that God is a mathematician, and when dialectical materialists 
fiercely assert that matter, life and history are wholly subordinate to a 
determinism of which we shall one day discover the mathematical expression, it 
is sad to think that under certain historical circumstances the supporters of 
each of these schools could (and in fact did) have the others shot. It is sad 
because they all say exactly the same thing, simply giving it a different name.</p>

<p class="fst">A &#8216;non-idealist&#8217; dialectic must also be a &#8216;non-materialist&#8217; 
dialectic, in the sense that it refuses to posit an absolute Being, whether as 
idea, as matter, or as the <i>de jure</i> already given totality of all the 
possible determinations. Such a dialectic must eliminate notions such as closure 
and completion, and reject all finite world systems. It should set aside the 
rationalist illusion, seriously accept the idea that there is infinite and 
indefinite, admit - without thereby forsaking work on the matter - that all 
rational determination leaves a non-determined and non-rational residue, that 
the residue is just as essential as what has been analysed, that necessity and 
contingency continually interpenetrate, that &#8216;nature&#8217;, both outside and within 
us, is always something other and something more than what our consciousness 
makes of it - and that all this is not only valid for the &#8216;object&#8217;, but also for 
the subject, and not just for the &#8216;empirical&#8217; subject but also for the 
&#8216;transcendental&#8217; subject, since all transcendental law-making by consciousness 
presupposes the raw fact that a consciousness exists in a world (order and 
disorder, seizable and inexhaustible), a fact that consciousness cannot itself 
produce, either really or symbolically. It is only on this condition that a 
dialectic can really envisage living history, which a rationalist dialectic is 
obliged to kill before it can lay it out on the benches of its laboratories.</p>

<p class="fst">But such a transformation of the dialectic is only possible in 
its turn, if one goes beyond the traditional and age-old idea of theory as both 
closed system and contemplation. That was, in fact, one of the key insights of 
the young Marx.</p>

<h2><a name="h11">The Two Elements of Marxism<br>
and Their Historic Fate</a></h2>

<p class="fst">There are in Marxism two elements whose meaning and historical 
fate have been radically opposed to one another.</p>

<p class="fst">The revolutionary element bursts forth in the youthful works of 
Marx, still appears from time to time in his mature works, occasionally 
reappears in the writings of the greatest Marxists - Rosa Luxemburg, Lenin, 
Trotsky - re-emerging for the last time in Lukacs. Its appearance represents an 
essential twist in the history of humanity. This element seeks to dethrone 
speculative philosophy by proclaiming that it is no longer a question of 
interpreting the world but of changing it, and that we must go beyond philosophy 
as one realises philosophy. This element refuses to provide itself, in advance, 
with the solution to the problem of history or with a completed dialectic. It 
asserts that communism is not an ideal state towards which society is advancing, 
but the real movement which puts an end to the existing state of affairs. It 
stresses the fact that men make their own history, in given conditions each 
time, and will declare that the emancipation of the workers will be brought 
about by the workers themselves. It is this element which will be capable of 
recognising in the Paris Commune or in the Russian Soviets not only the 
insurrectionary events but the creation by the masses in action of new forms of 
social life. For the time being it matters little that this recognition has 
remained partial and theoretical, or that the ideas mentioned above are no more 
than points of departure, raising new problems or side-stepping others. There is 
here, and one would have to be blind not to see it, the promise of a new world, 
a project radically to transform society, a quest for the conditions of this 
transformation in actual history and for its meaning in the situation and 
activity of people seeking to achieve it. We are not in the world just to look 
at it, or to suffer it; our destiny isn't slavery. An action is possible, which 
finds support in that which is, in order to bring about that which we want to 
be. To understand that we are sorcerers&#8217; apprentices is already one step out of 
the condition of sorcerer's apprentice. And to understand <i>why</i> we are such is yet 
another step. Beyond an activity unaware of its true ends and of its real 
effects, beyond a technique which according to exact calculations modifies an 
object without anything new resulting therefrom, there can and must be an 
historical praxis which transforms the world while transforming itself, which 
allows itself to learn through educating others, which prepares what is new 
while refusing to predetermine it because it knows that people make their own 
history.</p>

<p class="fst">In Marxism these insights were to remain insights, they were 
never really developed.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> The 
promise of a new world was quickly stifled by the prolific growth of a second 
element which will develop into a system, which will rapidly become predominant 
and will relegate the first into oblivion or will only use it - and that rarely 
- as an ideological and philosophical alibi. This second element reasserts and 
extends the deepest tendencies of capitalist culture and of capitalist society, 
even if it does so through the negation of several apparently (and really) 
important aspects of capitalism. It knits together the social logic of 
capitalism and the scientific positivism of the 19th century. It drives Marx to 
compare social evolution to a natural process<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a>, 
stresses economic determinism and greets in Darwin's theory a discovery parallel 
to that of Marx.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> As always 
this scientific positivism overturns immediately into rationalism and idealism 
as soon as it raises fundamental questions and attempts to answer them. History 
(it says) is a rational system subject to given laws, the main ones of which we 
can define as from now. Knowledge forms a system whose principles are already 
understood. There is certainly an &#8216;asymptotic&#8217; progress<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> 
but this is verification and refinement of a solid core of acquired truths: the 
&#8216;laws of the dialectic&#8217;. As a corollary, theory retains its eminent place, its 
primacy - however much one may invoke &#8216;the golden tree of life&#8217; or however much 
one may refer to praxis as the ultimate verification.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Everything holds together in this conception: the analysis of 
capitalism, general philosophy, the theory of history, the condition of the 
working class, the political programme. And the most far-reaching consequences 
flow from it - both in sound logic and in real history as has been shown by the 
experience of half a century. The development of the productive forces rules the 
rest of social life. Therefore, even if this development is not in itself the 
ultimate end, it is in practice the ultimate end since the rest is determined by 
and &#8216;moreover&#8217; flows from it, since &#8216;the true realm of freedom ... can only 
blossom forth with this realm of necessity as its basis&#8217; this pre-supposing 
abundance and the reduction of the working day which, in turn, pre-suppose a 
given degree of development of the productive forces. This development is called 
progress. To be sure, the vulgar ideology of progress is denounced and derided. 
It is shown that capitalist progress is based upon the poverty of the masses. 
But this poverty itself is seen as part of a forward moving process. The 
exploitation of the working class is justified &#8216;historically&#8217;, as long as the 
bourgeoisie uses the fruits of this exploitation for purposes of accumulation, 
thereby continuing its economic expansion. The capitalist class, an exploiting 
class from the outset, is said to be a progressive class as long as it keeps 
developing the productive forces.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> 
In the great Hegelian realist tradition, not only this exploitation but all the 
crimes of the capitalist class, recorded and denounced at one level, are 
recuperated at another by the rationality of history and finally, as there is no 
other criterion, justified. &#8216;Universal history is not the place for happiness&#8217;, 
as Hegel said.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h12">Marxism and the bureaucracy</a></h3>

<p class="fst">People have often asked themselves how Marxists could have been 
Stalinists. But if the bosses are progressive provided they go on building 
factories, surely the same should apply to the commissars, who build just as 
many or even more.<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> And as for 
this development of productive forces, it is seen as univocal 
<span class="inote">[having one meaning only]</span> and univocally 
determined by the state of technology. There is only one nexus of techniques at 
any given stage of history, and there is therefore only one rational set of 
methods of production. There is no question, there is no sense in trying to 
develop a society by means other than &#8216;industrialisation&#8217; - a term apparently 
neutral but which will finally produce its wholly capitalist litter. The rationalisation of production is the rationalisation already created by 
capitalism. It is the primacy of the &#8216;economic&#8217; in all senses of the word. It is 
quantification. It is the plan which treats men and their activities as 
measurable variables. Reactionary under capitalism from the moment the latter 
ceases developing the productive forces and only uses these techniques for an 
increasingly parasitic type of exploitation, all this becomes progressive under 
the &#8216;dictatorship of the proletariat&#8217;. The &#8216;dialectical transformation of the 
meaning of Taylorism, for instance, will be made quite explicit by Trotsky as 
early as 1919.<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> It matters 
little that this situation leaves some philosophical problems unsolved (how, in 
these conditions, can identical infrastructures support opposite social 
constructions?) or that it also leaves certain real problems unsolved (insofar 
as immature workers fail to understand the difference between the Taylorism of 
the bosses and that of the Socialist State). The first will be leapt over with 
the help of &#8216;dialectics&#8217;, the second silenced with gunshots. Universal history 
isn't the place for subtlety, either.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, if there is a true theory of history, a rationality at 
work in things, it is clear that guiding its development should be entrusted to 
specialists of this theory, to the technicians of this rationality. The absolute 
power of the Party - and, within the Party, of the &#8216;chorus leaders of 
Marxist-Leninist science&#8217;, according to the admirable expression coined by 
Stalin for his own use - has a legitimate philosophical basis. Its rational 
foundations lie more genuinely in the &#8216;materialist conception of history&#8217; than 
in Kautsky's ideas (reiterated by Lenin) about &#8216;the introduction of socialist 
consciousness into the working class by petty-bourgeois intellectuals&#8217;. If the 
materialist conception of history is true, the Party's power must be absolute, 
all democracy being mere concession to the human fallibility of the rulers, or a 
teaching procedure they alone can dispense in the correct doses. The 
alternatives are clear-cut. Either the materialist conception of history is 
true, therefore defining what is to be done, and what the workers do is of value 
only inasmuch as they conform to what the theory says they ought to do; it isn't 
the theory which would be validated or invalidated by what they actually do, for 
the criteria of its correctness are contained in it: it is the workers who show 
whether or not they have risen to a &#8216;consciousness of their historical 
interests&#8217; by acting in conformity with the slogans which concretise the theory 
in any given circumstances.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a> Or 
the activity of the masses <i>is</i> an autonomous and creative historical factor, in 
which case any theoretical conception can only be one link in the long process 
of realisation of the revolutionary project (which can, indeed should, be 
overtaken). The theory then no longer posits itself as the key to history, as 
the yardstick of reality. It accepts the need genuinely to enter history and to 
be jostled and judged by it.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> 
But then there is no historical privilege, no &#8216;historical birthright&#8217; for the 
organisation based on the theory.</p>

<p class="fst">This enhanced status of the Party, an inescapable consequence of 
the classical conception, finds its counterpart in what is, despite appearances, 
the devalued status of the working class. If the latter has a privileged 
historical role it is because, as an exploited class, it can only, in the end, 
struggle against capitalism in a direction predetermined by the theory. It is 
also because, placed as it is at the heart of capitalist production, the working 
class forms the largest force in society. &#8216;Trained, taught and disciplined&#8217; by 
this production, it is the vehicle par excellence of this rational discipline. 
The working class assumes importance not so much as creator of new historical 
forms, but as the human materialisation of the positive side of capitalism shorn 
of its negative aspects: it is &#8216;productive force&#8217; par excellence, and moreover 
contains nothing within it which could hamper the development of the productive 
forces.</p>

<p class="sub">*</p>

<p class="fst">History is thus found yet again to have given birth to something 
other than that which it seemed to be concocting. Under cover of a revolutionary 
theory an ideology had taken shape and developed the ideology of a social 
formation as yet unborn: the ideology of the bureaucracy.</p>

<p class="fst">It isn't possible here to attempt an explanation of the birth and 
triumph of this second element in Marxism. It would require going over the 
history of the labour movement and of capitalist society during the last hundred 
years. We can just summarise briefly what seems to us to have been the key 
factors. The development of Marxism as a theory took place in the intellectual 
and philosophical climate of the second half of the 19th century. This period 
was dominated, as no other period of history, by scientism and positivism 
triumphantly carried forward by the accumulation of scientific discoveries, 
their experimental verification, and especially, for the first time on this 
scale, by &#8216;the reasoned application of science to industry&#8217;. Apparent 
technological omnipotence was &#8216;demonstrated&#8217; daily. Whole countries were having 
their faces rapidly changed through the spread of the industrial revolution. 
Aspects of technical progress, which appear to us today not only ambivalent but 
even indeterminate as to their social signification, had not yet emerged. The 
economy posited itself as the essence of all social relationships, and the 
economic problem as <i>the</i> central problem of society. This setting provided both 
the bricks and the design for a &#8216;scientific&#8217; theory of society and of history. 
It even demanded it, largely predetermining what were to be its dominant 
categories. But the reader who has understood what we were getting at in the 
preceding pages will also appreciate that we cannot think of these factors as 
providing &#8216;the explanation&#8217; of the fate of Marxism. The fate of the 
revolutionary element in Marxism expresses, at the level of ideologies, the fate 
of the revolutionary movement in capitalist society up till now. When we say 
that Marxism, over a period of a century, has gradually been transformed into an 
ideology which belongs in existing society, we are only saying that capitalism 
has been able to maintain and even to strengthen itself as a social system. One 
cannot conceive of a society where the powers of the ruling class continuously 
assert themselves and where, simultaneously, a revolutionary theory is alive and 
develops. The fate of Marxism is inseparable from what happens to the society in 
which it exists.</p>

<p class="fst">This fate cannot be reversed. There can be no &#8216;restoration&#8217; of 
Marxism to its original purity, no return to its &#8216;better half&#8217;. One still 
sometimes meets subtle and tender &#8216;Marxists&#8217; (who as a rule have never engaged 
in politics either at close hand or from afar) for whom, strange as it may seem, 
the whole of subsequent history can be understood by studying the early works of 
Marx - and not those texts interpreted in the light of subsequent history. They 
seek thereby to maintain the claim that Marxism has &#8216;overtaken&#8217; philosophy by 
fusing it both to a concrete (economic) analysis of society and to a practice 
and that thereby it is no longer, and indeed never could be, either conjecture 
or theoretical system. These claims (which are based on a certain way of reading 
certain pages of Marx, and on amnesia concerning certain other passages 
infinitely more numerous) are not &#8216;false&#8217;. There are indeed, as we have said 
earlier, essential seeds in these ideas. But what must be recognised is not only 
that these seeds have been buried by the ice of a hundred years. It is that as 
soon as one tries to go beyond the stage of inspirations, intuitions or 
programmatic intentions - as soon as these ideas have to be given flesh and 
blood, to become the substance of thoughts which try to encompass the real world 
and give rise to acts, the fine new unity dissolves. It dissolves because what 
sought to be a philosophical description of the reality of capitalism, the 
integration of philosophy and economics, falls apart in two stages: a resorption 
of philosophy by an economics that is just economics, and then an unjustified 
reappearance of philosophy tagged on at the end of the economic analysis. It 
breaks up because what should be the union of theory and practice becomes 
dissociated in real history into a doctrine fossilised in the state in which it 
was left at the death of its founder, and a practice for which this doctrine 
serves, at best, as an ideological cover. It breaks up, for apart from certain 
rare moments (such as 1917) the interpretation of which moreover remains to be 
carried out and is in no way simple, <i>praxis</i> has remained a mere word. The 
problem of how to relate an activity which is intended to be conscious to actual 
history and the problem of the relationship between revolutionaries and masses 
both remain total.</p>

<p class="fst">Whether there can be a philosophy which is other than, and more 
than, philosophy remains to be shown. Whether there is a form of politics which 
is other than, and more than, politics again remains to be seen. If there can be 
a union of reflection and action, and whether this reflection and this action, 
instead of separating those who practice them from the others, can carry them 
both together towards a new society, this union still has to be achieved. The 
intention of such a unification was there when Marxism was born. It has remained 
mere intention - but a century later, and in a new context, it continues to 
define our task.</p>

not &#8216;an approximation improved by subsequent theories&#8217;. The idea of &#8216;successive

meaningless 19th century Progressivism which still largely dominates the 
thinking of scientists.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> Determinism only has meaning 
as total determinism: even the tone of the voice of a fascist demagogue or of a 
working class orator should flow from the laws of the system. To the extent that 
this is impossible, determinism takes refuge behind distinctions between what is 
&#8216;important&#8217; and what is &#8216;secondary&#8217;. We are told that Clemenceau added a certain 
personal style to the policies of French Imperialism, but that style or no 
style, these policies would in any case have been &#8216;the same&#8217; in their important 
aspects, in their essence. Reality is thus divided into a principal layer, where 
&#8216;essential&#8217; things happen (and where causal connections can and must be 
established around the event considered) and a secondary layer (where such 
connections either don't exist or don't matter). Determinism can thus only 
fulfil itself by again dividing the world. It is only at the level of ideas that 
it aims at &#8216;one world&#8217;&#8212; when applied, it is compelled to postulate a 
&#8216;non-determined&#8217; part of reality.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n7" href="#fn7">[7]</a> See, for example, the 
studies of Margaret Mead in Male and Female, or in Sex and Temperament in Three 
Primitive Societies.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n8" href="#fn8">[8]</a> Thus merely to refer to an 
&#8216;infinite series of causations&#8217; doesn't solve the problem.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n9" href="#fn9">[9]</a> Of course, that is not an 
absolute truth. There are also bad laws which are incoherent, or which 
themselves destroy the ends they seek to serve. This phenomenon seems, moreover, 
curiously restricted to modern societies. But this doesn't alter the essence of 
what we are saying: it remains an extreme variant of the production of coherent 
social rules.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n10" href="#fn10">[10]</a> We do not say &#8216;of society 
in general&#8217;. We are not discussing the metaphysical problem of the origins.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n11" href="#fn11">[11]</a> One could obviously go on 
discussing this forever. One can almost certainly say that the revolution would 
not have taken the form of a seizure of power by the Bolshevik Party. Perhaps it 
might have consisted of a re-enactment of the Commune. The content of such 
considerations may seem pointless. The fact that they are unavoidable shows that 
history cannot be thought of, even retrospectively, outside of the categories of 
the possible, or of the accident which is more than an accident.</p>

&#8216;subjectivist&#8217; dialectic of this type may be found in the early works of Marx, 
and they form the substance of Lukacs&#8217; thought. We shall return to this later.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n17" href="#fn17">[17]</a> Except, up to a point, by 
Lukacs (in History and Class Consciousness). It is moreover striking that 
Lukacs, when he wrote the essays contained in this book, was not aware of some 
of the most important early manuscripts of Marx (notably that of 1844 entitled 
Political Economy and Philosophy and the German Ideology) which were not 
published until 1925 and 1931.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n18" href="#fn18">[18]</a> In his postface to the 
second edition of Capital, Marx quotes (describing it as &#8216;generous&#8217;, the account 
of his &#8216;method&#8217; outlined in the European Courier of St Petersburg. This affirmed 
notably that &#8216;Marx considered social evolution as a natural process, governed by 
laws which do not depend on the will, consciousness or intention of men, but on 
the contrary determine these&#8217;). (Selected Works, vol. I, p. 454)</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n19" href="#fn19">[19]</a> A comparison made on 
several occasions by Engels. That does not mean, obviously, that one should 
underestimate the importance of Darwin in the history of science or even in that 
of ideas in general.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n20" href="#fn20">[20]</a> Engels voices this idea 
on several occasions, notably in Anti-Dühring. The idea masks a bizarre and 
shameful crypto-Kantism, and is in open contradiction with all &#8216;dialectic&#8217;.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n21" href="#fn21">[21]</a> Lukacs shows quite 
rightly that practice, as understood by Engels, that is &#8216;the attitude proper to 
industry and to experiment&#8217; is &#8216;the most properly contemplative of behaviours&#8217; 
(History and Class Consciousness). But he too throws the veil of Noah's son over 
his father's nakedness, by giving us implicitly to understand that we are faced 
here with a personal error by Engels, who on this point would have been 
unfaithful to the true spirit of Marx. But what Marx thought even in his youth, 
was in no way different: &#8216;The question whether objective truth can be attributed 
to human thinking is not a question of theory but a practical question. In 
practice man must prove the truth, that is, the reality and power, the 
this-sidedness of his thinking. The dispute over the reality or non-reality of 
thinking which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question&#8217;. 
(Second Thesis on Feuerbach). In this text, it is obviously not a question 
exclusively, or even mainly of historical praxis, in the sense Lukacs meant it, 
but of &#8216;practice&#8217; in general, including experiment and industry. This is shown, 
moreover, by other passages in the early works. Now, not only does this practice 
remain, as Lukacs reminds us within the category of contemplation; it can never 
be a verification of thought in general, a &#8216;demonstration of the reality of 
thought&#8217;. We never encounter anything else in it except another phenomenon. 
There is no question of it allowing us to surpass Kantian problems.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n22" href="#fn22">[22]</a> Correlatively, it only 
ceases to be a progressive class when it puts a brake on their development. This 
idea comes up again and again in the writings of the great classical Marxists 
(beginning with Marx himself), to say nothing of their epigones. What becomes of 
this idea today, when it can be shown that, during the last 25 years, capitalism 
has been developing the productive forces more than forty previous centuries had 
done? How can a Marxist speak today of a revolutionary perspective and remain a 
Marxist, i.e. affirm in the same breath that &#8216;no social order ever perishes 
before all the productive forces for which there is room in it have developed&#8217; 
(Marx, preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Selected 
Works, vol. I, p. 363; FLPH, Moscow 1958). Neither Nikita Khrushchev, nor any 
&#8216;leftist&#8217; of any kind, has ever taken the trouble to explain this.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n23" href="#fn23">[23]</a> Obviously, we don't mean 
that the bourgeoisie was not &#8216;progressive&#8217;, nor that the development of the 
productive forces is reactionary, or of no interest. We say that there is no 
simple connection between these two things and that one cannot, as Marxism does, 
just make the &#8216;progressiveness&#8217; of a regime correspond to its capacity to 
develop the productive forces.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n24" href="#fn24">[24]</a> Terrorism and Communism, 
Ann Arbour Paperbacks (1961), p. 149. (&#8216;Under capitalism, the system of 
piece-work and of grading, the application of the Taylor system, etc. have as 
their object to increase the exploitation of the workers by squeezing out of 
surplus value. Under Socialist production, piece-work, bonuses, etc. have as 
their problem to increase the volume of social product and consequently to raise 
the general well-being. Those workers who do more for the general interest than 
others receive the right to a greater quantity of the social product than the 
lazy, the careless, and disorganizers.&#8217;)</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n25" href="#fn25">[25]</a> Sure, the slogans may be 
wrong, the leaders having been mistaken in their appreciation of a situation, 
and notably in their appreciation of the degree of consciousness and of 
militancy of the workers. But this doesn't change the logic of the problem. In 
the equation which the rulers have to solve, the workers still appear as an 
uncertain variable.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n26" href="#fn26">[26]</a> Just how alien this 
concept is to Marxists is shown by the fact that, for the &#8216;purest&#8217; among them, 
real history is seen implicitly as if it had &#8216;taken the wrong turning&#8217; since 
1939, or even since 1923, since it has not run along the track decided by 
theory. That the theory might just as well have gone astray much earlier never 
crosses their mind.</p>
