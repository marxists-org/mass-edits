<h2><a name="h1">[1. The Significance of the Russian Revolution]</a></h2>

<p class="fst">We are happy to present to our readers the first translation into 
French of Alexandra Kollontai's pamphlet <i>The Workers' Opposition in Russia</i>. 
This pamphlet was published in Moscow at the beginning of 1921, during the 
violent controversy that preceded the Tenth Congress of the Bolshevik party. 
This Congress was to close discussion forever on this controversy as well as on 
all the others.<a href="#r1" name="rn1" target="_self">[1*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">People have not finished talking about the Russian Revolution, 
its problems, its degeneration, and about the regime it ultimately produced. And 
how could one? Of all the revolts of the working class, the Russian Revolution 
was the only victorious one. And of all the working class's failures, it was the 
most thoroughgoing and the most revealing.</p>

<p class="fst">The crushing of the Paris Commune in 1871 and of the Budapest 
uprising in 1956 teach us that insurgent workers encounter immensely difficult 
organisational and political problems, that an insurrection can find itself 
isolated, that the ruling classes will not hesitate to employ any kind of 
violence or barbarian savagery when their power is at stake. The Russian 
Revolution, however, obliges us to reflect not only on the conditions for a 
proletarian victory but also on the content and the possible fate of such a 
victory, on its consolidation and development, on the seeds of a failure whose 
import infinitely surpasses the victory of the troops of the Versailles, of 
Franco's army, or of Khrushchev's tanks.</p>

<p class="fst">Since it crushed the White armies and yet succumbed to a 
bureaucracy it had itself generated, the Russian Revolution puts us face to face 
with problems of a different order from those involving a study of the tactics 
and methods of an armed insurrection or a correct analysis of the relation of 
forces at a given moment. It obliges us to reflect on the nature of the power of 
labouring people and on what we mean by socialism. Culminating in a regime in 
which economic concentration, the totalitarian power of the rulers, and the 
exploitation of the labouring population have been pushed to the limit, and 
producing to an extreme degree the centralisation of capital and its fusion with 
the State, in its outcome this revolution presents us with what has been and in 
certain respects still remains the most highly developed and the "purest" form 
of a modern exploitative society.</p>

<p class="fst">Embodying Marxism for the first time in history - only to make us 
see immediately in this incarnation a monstrous disfiguration of it - the 
Russian Revolution allows us to understand more about Marxism than what Marxism 
itself has been able to help us to understand about the Revolution. The regime 
the Revolution produced has become the touchstone for all current ideas, not 
only those of classical Marxism, of course, but just as much those of the 
bourgeois ideologies. This regime has proved the ruination of Marxism through 
its very realisation and has proved the triumph of the deepest layers of these 
other ideologies through its very refutations of them. Even as this regime has 
expanded to embrace a third of the globe, has been challenged by workers' 
revolts against it over the past ten years, has attempted to reform itself, and 
has now split into two opposing poles, the Russian and the Chinese, it has not 
ceased to raise questions of the most pressing importance and to act as the 
clearest as well as the most enigmatic indicator of world history. The world we 
live in, reflect in, and act in was launched on its present course by the 
workers and Bolsheviks of Petrograd in October 1917.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<h2><a name="h2">[2. The Main Questions]</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Among the innumerable questions raised by the fate of the Russian 
Revolution, two form the poles around which we may organise all the others.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>The first question</i> is: What kind of society was produced 
by the degeneration of the revolution? (What is the nature and the dynamic of 
this regime? What is the Russian bureaucracy? What is its relation to capitalism 
and to the proletariat? What is its place in history? What are its present 
problems?) This question has already been discussed on several occasions in 
<i>S. ou B.</i><a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> and will be again.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The second question is, How can a workers' revolution give birth 
to a bureaucracy, and how did this occur in Russia? We have examined this 
question in its theoretical form,<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> but so far we have said little from the 
concrete historical point of view. Indeed, there is an almost insurmountable 
obstacle to a close study of this particularly obscure period extending from 
October 1917 to March 1921, during which the fate of the revolution was played 
out. The question of most concern to us is, in effect, the following: To what 
extent did the Russian workers try to take upon themselves the direction of 
society, the management of production, the regulation of the economy, and the 
orientation of political life? What was their conscious awareness of these 
problems, the character of their autonomous activity? What was their attitude 
toward the Bolshevik party, toward the nascent bureaucracy? Now, we should point 
out that it is not workers who write history. It is always <i>the others</i>. 
And these others, whoever they may be, have a historical existence only insofar 
as the masses are passive, or active simply to support them, and this is 
precisely what "the others" will tell us at every opportunity. Most of the time 
these others will not even possess eyes to see and ears to hear the gestures and 
utterances that express people's autonomous activity. In the best of instances, 
they will sing the praises of this activity so long as it <i>miraculously</i> 
coincides with their own line, but they will radically condemn it, and impute to 
it the basest motives, as soon as it strays there from. Thus Trotsky describes 
in grandiose terms the anonymous workers of Petrograd moving ahead of the 
Bolshevik party or mobilising themselves during the Civil War, but later on he 
was to characterise the Kronstadt rebels as "stool pigeons" and "hirelings of 
the French High Command." They lack the categories of thought - the brain cells, 
we might dare say - necessary to understand, or even to record, this activity as 
it really occurs: to them, an activity that is not instituted, that has neither 
boss nor program, has no status; it is not even clearly perceivable, except 
perhaps in the mode of "disorder" and "troubles." The autonomous activity of the 
masses belongs by definition to what is <i>repressed</i> in history.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus, it is not only that the documentary records most 
interesting to us during this period are fragmentary, or even that they were and 
continue to be systematically suppressed by the triumphant bureaucracy. It is 
that this record of events is infinitely more <i>selective</i> and <i>slanted</i> 
than any other historical testimony. The reactionary rage of bourgeois witnesses 
and the almost equally vicious hostility of the social democrats; the delirious 
ravings of the anarchists; the official historiography, periodically rewritten 
to suit the needs of the bureaucracy, and that of the Trotskyist tendency 
concerned exclusively with justifying itself after the fact and with hiding its 
role during the first stages of degeneration - all this "historical evidence" 
converges on one point: it ignores the signs of the autonomous activity of the 
masses during this period, or, if necessary, "proves" the a priori impossibility 
of its very existence. In this regard, the information contained in Alexandra 
Kollontai's text is of priceless value. First, because of the direct indications 
it supplies concerning the attitudes and reactions of Russian workers toward the 
policy of the Bolshevik party; second and more important, because it shows that 
a large portion of the working-class base of the Party was aware of the process 
of bureaucratization that was taking place, and was taking a stand against it. 
It is no longer possible, after reading this text, to continue to describe the 
Russia of 1920 as "just chaos," "a pile of ruins," where the thought of Lenin 
and the "iron will" of the Bolsheviks were the only elements of order in a 
country whose proletariat had been pulverised. The workers wanted something, and 
they showed what they wanted through the Workers' Opposition within the Party 
and the Petrograd strikes and the Kronstadt revolt outside the Party. Both the 
intraparty and the extraparty challenges had to be crushed by Lenin and Trotsky 
for Stalin later to emerge triumphant.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<h2><a name="h3">[3. The Traditional "Answers"]</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Back to the main question: How could the Russian Revolution have 
produced a bureaucratic regime? The current answer (first advanced by Trotsky, 
later taken up by the fellow travellers of Stalinism, and today by Khrushchev's 
men themselves in order to "explain" the "bureaucratic deformations of the 
socialist system") is the following: the Revolution took place in a backward 
country, which in any case could not have built socialism on its own; it found 
itself isolated by the defeat of the revolution in Europe (and more particularly 
in Germany between 1919 and 1923); and what is more, the country was completely 
divested by the Civil War.</p>

<p class="fst">This answer would not deserve a moment's consideration, were it 
not for the fact that it is widely accepted and that it continues to play a 
mystificatory role. For it is completely beside the point.</p>

<p class="fst">The backwardness, isolation, and devastation of the country - all 
incontestable facts in themselves - might just as well have explained a pure and 
simple defeat of the revolution and the restoration of classical capitalism. 
What we are asking, however, is precisely why there was no pure and simple 
defeat, why the Revolution overcame its external enemies only to collapse from 
within, why it "degenerated" precisely in such a way that it led to the power of 
the bureaucracy.</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky's answer, if we may use a metaphor, is like saying, "This 
patient developed tuberculosis because he was run down." Feeling run down, 
however, he might have died instead, or contracted some other disease. Why did 
he contract <i>this particular</i> disease? What has to be explained in the 
degeneration of the Russian Revolution is why it was specifically a 
<i>bureaucratic</i> degeneration. This cannot be done by referring to factors as 
general as "backwardness" or "isolation." Let us add in passing that this 
"response" teaches us nothing we could extend beyond the confines of the Russian 
situation in 1920. The sole conclusion to be drawn from this kind of "analysis" 
is that revolutionaries should ardently hope that future revolutions break out 
an more advanced countries, that they should not remain isolated, and that civil 
wars should not in the least be devastating.</p>

<p class="fst">After all, the fact that [since the Second World War] the 
bureaucratic system of rule has extended its frontiers well beyond the 
boundaries of Russia, that it has installed similar regimes in countries that in 
no way can be characterised as backward (such as Czechoslovakia or East 
Germany), and that industrialisation - which has made Russia the second 
strongest power in the world - has not weakened this bureaucracy at all, shows 
that all discussion in terms of "backwardness," "isolation," V and so forth, is 
purely and simply anachronistic.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="h4">[4. Bureaucracy in the Modern World]</a></h2>

<p class="fst">If we wish to understand the emergence of the bureaucracy as an 
increasingly preponderant managerial stratum in the contemporary world, we are 
obliged to note at the outset that, paradoxically, it appears at the two 
opposite poles of social development. On the one hand, it has emerged as the 
organic product of the maturation process of capitalist society. On the other 
hand, it appears as the "forced answer" backward countries give to the problem 
of their own <i>passage</i> to the stage of industrialisation.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">[A. Modern Capitalist Countries]</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In the first case, the emergence of the bureaucracy offers us no 
mystery. The concentration of production necessarily leads to the appearance 
within business firms of a stratum whose function is to take on the collective 
management of immense economic units. The task to be performed goes 
qualitatively beyond the capacities of any individual owner. At first in the 
economic realm, but gradually also in other spheres, the growing role of the 
State leads both to a quantitative extension of the bureaucratic state apparatus 
and to a qualitative change in its nature.</p>

<p class="fst">At the opposite pole within advanced capitalist societies, the 
workers' movement degenerates as it becomes bureaucratised, it becomes 
bureaucratised as it becomes integrated into the established order, and it 
cannot become integrated into this order without becoming bureaucratised. The 
various techno-economic, state-political, and "working-class" elements 
constitutive of the bureaucracy coexist with varying degrees of success. They 
coexist both with each other and with the more properly "bourgeois" elements of 
society (owners of the means of production). In any case, as the bureaucracy 
evolves, the importance of these bureaucratic elements for the management of 
society constantly increases. In this sense, one can say that the emergence of 
the bureaucracy corresponds to an "ultimate" phase in the process of capital 
concentration, that the bureaucracy personifies or embodies capital during this 
phase, in the same way that the bourgeoisie did during the previous phase.</p>

<p class="fst">At least as far as its origins and its social-historical function 
are concerned, this bureaucracy can be understood in terms of the categories of 
classical Marxism. (It matters little, in this respect, that today's alleged 
Marxists, who fall forever short of the possibilities entailed by the theory 
they claim as theirs, remain incapable of granting the bureaucracy any kind of 
socio-historical status. These so-called Marxists believe that there is no name 
for this thing in their ideas, and so in practice they deny its existence and 
speak of capitalism, as if nothing had changed within capitalism for the past 
century or half century.)</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h6">[B. Economically Backward Countries]</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In the second case, the bureaucracy emerges, one might say, from 
the very void found in this type of society. In almost all backward countries, 
the old ruling strata are clearly incapable of undertaking the industrialisation 
of the country. Foreign capital creates, at "best," merely isolated pockets of 
modern exploitation, and the late-born national bourgeoisie in such countries 
has neither the strength nor the courage necessary to revolutionise the old 
social structures from top to bottom, as would be required by the process of 
modernisation. Let us add that, because of this very fact, the national 
proletariat is too weak to play the role assigned to it by the schema of 
"permanent revolution," that is, it is too weak to eliminate the old ruling 
strata and to undertake the process of transformation that would lead, in an 
uninterrupted fashion, from the "bourgeois-democratic" phase through to 
socialism.</p>

<p class="fst">What can happen then? A backward society can stagnate and remain 
stagnant for a longer or shorter period of time. (This is the situation today of 
backward countries, whether or not they have been constituted as States only 
recently.) But this process of stagnation in fact signifies a relative and 
sometimes an absolute deterioration of their economic and social situation, as 
well as a rupture of the old equilibrium built into these societies. Aggravated 
almost always by apparently "accidental" factors (which in fact recur inevitably 
and which are amplified to an infinitely greater degree in a society undergoing 
disintegration), each upset in the balance of these societies turns into a 
crisis, often coloured by some "national" component. This can result in an overt 
and prolonged national-social struggle (China, Algeria, Cuba, Indochina) or a 
coup d'état, almost inevitably military in nature (Egypt).</p>

<p class="fst">These two examples exhibit immense differences, but they also 
share a common point.</p>

<p class="fst">In the first type of example (China, etc.), the politico-military 
leadership of the struggle gradually erects itself into an autonomous stratum 
that manages the "revolution" and, after victory, takes in hand the 
reconstruction of the country. To this end, it naturally incorporates all those 
members of the old privileged strata who have rallied to its cause while also 
selecting certain members of the masses. And as the country industrialises, it 
constitutes these elements into a hierarchical pyramid that will serve as the 
skeleton of the new social structure. This industrialisation is carried out, of 
course, according to the classical methods of primitive accumulation. These 
methods involve intense exploitation of the workers and an even more intense 
exploitation of the peasantry, who are more or less press-ganged into an 
industrial army of labour.</p>

<p class="fst">In the second example (Egypt, etc.), the state-military 
bureaucracy, while playing a role of tutelage with regard to the existing 
privileged strata, does not completely eliminate these strata or the social 
situation they represent. Also, one can almost always foresee that the country 
will not be fully transformed and industrialised until there is a further 
violent convulsion.</p>

<p class="fst">In both instances, however, what we discover is that the 
bureaucracy substitutes or tends to substitute itself for the bourgeoisie as the 
social stratum that carries out the task of primitive accumulation.</p>

<p class="fst">We must note that this bureaucracy has effectively shattered the 
traditional categories of Marxism. In no way can it be said that this new social 
stratum has been constituted and has grown within the womb of the preceding 
society. Nor is it born out of a new mode of production whose development had 
become incompatible with the maintenance of old forms of economic and social 
life. It is, on the contrary the bureaucracy that gives birth to this new mode 
of production in the societies we are considering. It is not itself born out of 
the normal functioning of society, but rather out of the inability of this 
society to function. Almost without metaphor, we can say that it has its origin 
in the social void: its historical roots plunge wholly into the future. It 
obviously makes no sense to say that the Chinese bureaucracy is the product of 
the country's industrialisation when it would be infinitely more reasonable to 
say that the industrialisation of China is the product of the bureaucracy's 
accession to power. We can only move beyond this antinomy by pointing out that 
in the present epoch, and short of a revolutionary solution on an international 
scale, a backward country can industrialise only by becoming bureaucratised.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h7">[C. Russia]</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In the case of Russia, one might say that, after the fact, the 
bureaucracy seems to have fulfilled the "historical function"<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> of the 
bourgeoisie of earlier times, or of the bureaucracy of a backward country today. 
Up to a certain point, therefore, the Russian bureaucracy can be compared to the 
latter sort of bureaucracy.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> The conditions under which it arose, however, are 
different. And this difference is due precisely to the fact that the Russia of 
1917 was not simply a "backward" country, but a country that, besides its 
backwardness, exhibited certain well-developed features of capitalism (Russia 
was, in 1913, the fifth strongest industrial power in the world) - so well 
developed, as a matter of fact, that it was the theatre of a proletarian 
revolution proclaiming itself socialist (long before this word had come to 
signify anything one wants and nothing at all).</p>

<p class="fst">The first bureaucracy to have become a ruling class in its 
society, the Russian bureaucracy appears precisely as the end product of a 
revolution that everyone thought had given power to the proletariat. It 
therefore represents a third, quite specific type (although in fact it was the 
first clearly to emerge within modern history): the bureaucracy born from the 
degeneration of a working-class revolution. It is this degeneration - even if, 
from the outset, the Russian bureaucracy accomplishes such functions as "manager 
of centralised capital" and acts as the "stratum for developing a modern 
industrial economy by every means available."</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="h8">[5. The Working Class in the Russian Revolution]</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Keeping in mind precisely what came afterward, and recollecting 
too that the October 1917 "seizure of power" was organised and directed by the 
Bolshevik party and that this Party in fact assumed this power as its own from 
day one, in what sense can one say that the October Revolution was proletarian 
(that is, if one refuses at least to identify a class simply with the party 
claiming power in that class' name)? Why not say - indeed, there has been no 
lack of people to say it - that there never was in Russia anything other than a 
coup d'état carried out by a party that, having somehow obtained the support of 
the working class, was merely trying to instaurate its own dictatorship and 
succeeded in doing so?</p>

<p class="fst">We have no intention of discussing this problem in scholastic 
terms. Our aim is not to ask whether the Russian Revolution fits into the 
category of "proletarian revolutions." The question that matters for us is this: 
Did the Russian working class play a historical role <i>of its own</i> during 
this period, or was it simply a sort of infantry, mobilised in the service of 
other, already established forces? In other words, did it appear as a relatively 
autonomous pole in the struggle and the whirlwind of actions, organisational 
forms, demands, and ideas of this period, or was it just a tool manipulated 
without great difficulty or risk, a relay station for impulses coming from 
elsewhere?</p>

<p class="fst">Anyone who has studied the history of the Russian Revolution even 
to the slight degree could answer without hesitation. Petrograd in 1917 and even 
afterward, was neither Prague in 1948 nor Canton in 1949. The proletariat's 
independent role was clearly apparent - even, to begin with, by the very way 
workers flocked into the ranks of the Bolshevik party, giving it majority 
support, which no one could have extorted from them or forced upon them at the 
time. This independent role was also shown by the rapport between the workers 
and this party and by the burden of the Civil War, which they spontaneously took 
upon themselves. Above all, however, it is shown by the autonomous actions they 
themselves undertook, already in February and July 1917 and even more so after 
October, when they expropriated the capitalists without waiting for, or even in 
acting against, the expressed will of the Party and when they organised 
production on their own. Finally, it is shown in the autonomous organs they set 
up: the soviets, and in particular, the factory committees.</p>

<p class="fst">The Revolution's success was made possible only because a vast 
movement of total revolt on the part of the working masses, whose will was to 
change the conditions of their existence and rid themselves of bosses and Czar, 
converged with the activity of the Bolshevik party. It is true that the 
Bolshevik party alone, in October 1917, was able to give articulate expression 
and an <i>intermediate objective</i> to the aspirations of the workers, the 
peasants, and the soldiers (the overthrow of the Provisional Government). This 
in no way means, however, that the workers were their passive infantry. Without 
these workers, both inside and outside its ranks, the Party was nothing, neither 
physically nor politically a force to be reckoned with. Without the pressure 
arising from their increasing radicalisation, it would not even have adopted a 
revolutionary line. And at no moment, even long months after the seizure of 
power, could it be said that the Party "controlled" the movements of the working 
masses.</p>

<p class="fst">This convergence, however, which actually culminated in the 
overthrow of the Provisional Government and in the formation of a predominantly 
Bolshevik government, turned out to be temporary. Signs of a gap between the 
Party and the masses appeared rather early on, even though, by its very nature, 
such a gap could not be grasped in as a clear-cut a way as one between organised 
political tendencies.</p>

<p class="fst">The workers certainly expected of the Revolution a total change 
in the conditions of their existence. They undoubtedly were expecting an 
improvement in their material conditions - knowing quite well that such an 
improvement would not come about immediately. Only the narrow-minded would tie 
the Revolution to this factor alone - or the workers' subsequent dissatisfaction 
to the new regime's incapacity to satisfy these hopes for material advancement. 
The Revolution began, in a certain sense, with a demand for bread. Long before 
October, however, it had already gone beyond the question of bread, and had 
engaged people's total, passionate commitment.</p>

<p class="fst">For more than three years, the Russian workers put up with the 
most extreme material privations without flinching. At the same time, they 
supplied the bulk of the forces that were going to defeat the White armies. For 
them, it was a question of freeing themselves from the oppression of the 
capitalist class and of its State. Organised in the soviets and in the factory 
committees, they found it inconceivable, even before but particularly after 
October, that the capitalists would be allowed to stay on. And in chasing them 
out of the factories, they were led to discover that they would have to organise 
and manage production themselves. The workers themselves expropriated the 
capitalists, doing so on their own authority and acting against the line of the 
Bolshevik party (the nationalisation decree of the summer of 1918 merely 
ratified what already had been done). And it was the workers who got the 
factories running once again.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="h9">[6. Bolshevik Policy]</a></h2>

<p class="fst">As for the Bolshevik party, this was not at all what they were 
after. Insofar as the Party developed any clear-cut line after October (and 
contrary to the mythology put out by Stalinists and Trotskyists alike, it can 
easily be shown, backed up by documentary records, that before and after October 
the Bolshevik party was totally in the dark as to what it wanted to do after the 
seizure of power), it aimed at instaurating in Russia a "well-organized" economy 
along the lines of the capitalist model of the time,<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> a form of "state 
capitalism" (the expression unceasingly used by Lenin), upon which would be 
superimposed a "working-class" political power - in fact, this power would be 
exercised by the party of the "working class," the Bolshevik party. "Socialism" 
(which effectively implies, Lenin writes without hesitation, the "collective 
management of production") will come afterward.</p>

<p class="fst">And this is not just a question of a "line," of something simply 
said or thought. In its deep-down mentality and in its real attitude, the Party 
was permeated from top to bottom with the unquestionable conviction that it 
ought to <i>lead</i>, <i>direct</i>, <i>manage</i> [<i>diriger</i>], in the full 
sense of the[se] term[s]. This conviction, which already existed long before the 
Revolution began (as Trotsky showed when he spoke of the "committee mentality" 
in his biography of Stalin), was indeed shared by all the socialists of the era 
(with a few exceptions, such as Rosa Luxemburg, the Gorter-Pannekoek tendency in 
Holland, and the "Left Communists" in Germany).This conviction was to be 
tremendously reinforced by the seizure of power, the Civil War, and the Party's 
consolidation of power. Trotsky himself clearly expressed this attitude at the 
time when he proclaimed the Party's "historical birthright."</p>

<p class="fst">This mentality was more than just a mentality: after the seizure 
of power, it almost immediately became a part of the <i>real social situation</i>. 
Individually, party members assumed leadership posts in all spheres of social 
life - in part, of course, because "one cannot do otherwise." This in turn, 
however, came to mean: because everything the Party did ensured that it could 
not be done otherwise.</p>

<p class="fst">Collectively, the only real instance of power is the Party, and 
very soon, only the summits of the Party. Immediately after the seizure of power 
the soviets as institutions are reduced to the status of pure window-dressing 
(we need only look at the fact that, already at the beginning of 1918 in the 
discussions leading up to the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty, their role was 
absolutely nil).</p>

<p class="fst">If it is true that people's real social existence determines 
their consciousness, it is from that moment illusory to expect the Bolshevik 
party to act in any other fashion than according to its real social position. 
The real social situation of the Party is that of a directorial organ, and its 
point of view toward this society henceforth is not necessarily the same as the 
one this society has toward itself.</p>

<p class="fst">The workers offered no serious resistance to this evolution of 
events, or rather to this sudden revelation of the essence of the Bolshevik 
party. At least we have no direct sign of such resistance. Between the eviction 
of the capitalists, followed by the restarting of the factories at the beginning 
of the revolutionary period, and the Petrograd strikes and the Kronstadt Revolt 
at its end (winter of 1920-21), we know of no articulate manifestation of 
autonomous activity on the part of the workers.<a href="#r2" name="rn2" target="_self">[2*]</a> The Civil War and the 
continuous mobilisation of military forces during this period, the serious 
nature of immediate practical problems (production, food supplies, etc.), the 
very obscurity of the issues at stake, and, without doubt, above all the 
workers' confidence in the Party explain this lack of autonomous expression.</p>

<p class="fst">Two elements go to make up the workers' attitudes in this regard. 
On the one hand, the aspiration to rid themselves of all domination, to take the 
management of their affairs into their hands. On the other hand, the tendency to 
delegate power to this party that had just proven itself to be the sole 
irreconcilable opponent of the capitalist class and that was in fact conducting 
war against this class. The opposition, the contradiction, between these two 
elements was not and, one would be tempted to say, could not have been clearly 
perceived at this time.</p>

<p class="fst">It <i>was</i> seen, however, and with great insight, within the 
Party itself. From the beginning of 1918 until the banning of factions in March 
1921, tendencies within the Bolshevik party were formed that, with 
farsightedness and sometimes an astonishing clarity, expressed opposition to the 
Party's bureaucratic line and to its very rapid bureaucratisation. These were 
the "Left Communists" (at the beginning of 1918), then the "Democratic 
Centralist" tendency (1919), and finally the "Workers' Opposition" (1920-21).</p>

<p class="fst">One will find in the <i>Historical Notes</i> we publish following 
Alexandra Kollontai's text details on the ideas and activities of these 
tendencies.<a href="#r3" name="rn3" target="_self">[3*]</a> In them were expressed the reactions of working-class members of 
the Party - and, no doubt, the attitudes of proletarian circles outside the 
Party - to the "state-capitalist" line of the leadership. They also expressed at 
the same time what can be called the "other component" of Marxism, the one that 
appeals to the masses' own activity and that proclaims that the emancipation of 
labouring people will be the work of these people themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, these oppositional tendencies were defeated one by 
one, and finally eliminated in 1921, the same time that the Kronstadt revolt was 
crushed. The very feeble echoes of their critique of the bureaucracy that can be 
found later in the (Trotskyist) "Left Opposition" after 1923 do not have the 
same signification. Trotsky was opposed to the <i>bad policies</i> of the 
bureaucracy and to the excesses of its power. He never put into question its 
essential nature. Until practically the end of his life, he never brought up the 
questions raised by the various oppositions of the period from 1918 to 1921 (in 
essence: "Who manages production?" and "What is the proletariat supposed to do 
during the 'dictatorship of the proletariat', other than work and follow the 
orders of 'its' party?").</p>

<p class="fst">We may therefore conclude that, contrary to the prevailing 
mythology, it was not in 1927, or in 1923, or even in 1921 that the game was 
played and lost, but much earlier, during the period from 1918 to 1920. Already 
in 1921, a revolution in the full sense of the term was needed in order to 
re-establish the situation. As events proved, a revolt such as the one at 
Kronstadt was not enough to bring about any essential changes. This warning shot 
did induce the Bolshevik party to rectify certain aberrations relative to other 
problems (basically those concerning the peasantry and the relationship between 
the urban and agrarian economy). It thus led to a lessening of the tensions 
provoked by the country's economic collapse and to the beginning of the 
reconstruction of the productive apparatus. This reconstruction effort, however, 
was already firmly set in the groove of bureaucratic capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">It was, indeed, between 1917 and 1920 that the Bolshevik party 
established itself so firmly in power that it no longer could have been 
dislodged except by force of arms. And it was from the beginning of this period 
that the uncertainties of its line were ironed out, the ambiguities lifted, and 
the contradictions resolved. In the new State, the proletariat was to work, to 
be mobilised, and, should the need arise, to die in defence of the new power. It 
was to give its most "conscious" and most "capable" members to "its" party, 
where they would become the leaders of society. It was to be "active" and it had 
to "participate" whenever it was asked to do so, but it was to do so only and 
exactly to the extent that the Party demanded this of the proletariat. Finally, 
it was to bow completely to the Party's will on all essential matters. As 
Trotsky wrote during this period in a text that had an enormous circulation both 
inside and outside Russia, "The worker does not merely bargain with the Soviet 
State; no, he is subordinated to the Soviet State, under its orders in every 
direction - for it is <i>his</i> State."<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="h10">[7. The Management of Production]</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The role of the proletariat in the new State was thus quite 
clear. It was that of enthusiastic and passive citizens. And the role of the 
proletariat in work and in production was no less clear. On the whole, it was 
the same as before - under capitalism - except that workers of "character and 
capacity"<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> were to be chosen to replace factory managers who had fled. The 
main concern of the Bolshevik party during this period was not how one could 
facilitate the process of workers' collectives taking over the management of 
production, but rather was: What is the most rapid way of developing a stratum 
of managers and administrators for industry and for the economy as a whole?</p>

<p class="fst">One need only read the <i>official</i> texts of this period to 
eliminate all doubts on this score. The formation and training of a bureaucracy 
as the managerial stratum in production (with the economic privileges that 
inevitably go along with this status) was, practically from the beginning, 
<i>the conscious</i>, <i>straight forward and</i>, <i>sincere policy of the 
Bolshevik party</i>, <i>headed by Lenin and Trotsky</i>. This was honestly and 
sincerely thought to be a socialist policy - or, more precisely, an 
"administrative technique" that could be put in the service of socialism, since 
the class of administrators managing production were to remain under the control 
of the working class, "personified by its Communist party." The decision to 
place a manager at the head of a factory instead of a workers' board [<i>bureau 
ouvrier</i>], wrote Trotsky, had no political significance:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It may be correct or incorrect from the point of view L 
technique of administration. ... It would consequently be a most crying error to 
confuse the question as to the supremacy of the proletariat with the question of 
boards of workers at the heads of factories. The dictatorship of the proletariat 
is expressed in the abolition of private property in the means of production, in 
the supremacy over the whole Soviet mechanism of the collective will of the 
workers, and not at all in the form in which individual economic enterprises are 
administered."<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky's phrase, "the collective will of the workers," is a 
metaphorical expression used to designate the will of the Bolshevik party. The 
Bolshevik bosses stated this without any hypocrisy, unlike certain of their 
"defenders" today. Trotsky wrote at the time:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In this 'substitution' of the power of the Party for the power 
of the working class there is nothing accidental, and in reality there is no 
substitution at all. The Communists express the fundamental interests of the 
working class. It is quite natural that in the period which brings up those 
interests, in all their magnitude, on to the order of the day, the Communists 
have become the recognised representatives of the working class as a whole."<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One can easily find dozens of quotations from Lenin expressing 
the same idea.</p>

<p class="fst">So we end up with the uncontested power of managers in the 
factories, and the Party's exclusive "control" (in reality, what kind of control 
was it, anyway?). A there was the uncontested power of the Party over society, 
without any From that point on, nobody could prevent these two powers from 
merging, could anyone stop the two strata embodying them from merging, nor could 
the consolidation of an irremovable bureaucracy ruling over all sectors of 
social life halted. The process may have been accelerated or magnified by the 
entry of proletarian elements into the Party, as they rushed to jump on the 
bandwagon - this was a <i>consequence</i>, and not a cause, of the Party's 
orientation.</p>

<p class="fst">It was during the discussion of the "trade-union question" 
(1920-21), which preceded the Tenth Party Congress, that opposition to this 
orientation of the Party was most forcefully expressed within the Party itself. 
Formally, the question that of the role of the trade unions in the management of 
production and of the economy. The discussion inevitably focused once again on 
the problems of "one-man management" in the factories and on "the role of 
specialists," questions that had ready been discussed bitterly and at great 
length during the previous two years. Kollontai's text and in the appended 
<i>Historical Notes</i>, the reader will find a description of the various opposing 
stands on these issues.</p>

<p class="fst">Briefly, the party leadership, with Lenin at its head, reaffirmed 
that the management of production should be in the hands of individual 
administrators bourgeois "specialists" or workers selected for their "character 
and capacity") under the control of the Party. The trade unions were to have the 
tasks of educating the workers of defending them against the production managers 
and the state managers. Trotsky demanded the trade unions' complete 
subordination to the State, their transformation into organs and appendages of 
the State (and of the Party). His argument al was the same: since we are in a 
Workers' State, the State and the workers are same thing, and therefore workers 
have no need for some separate organ defend them from "their" State. The 
Workers' Opposition demanded that management of production and of the economy 
gradually be entrusted to "workers' collectives" in the factories, as these had 
been organised in the trade unions. They wanted "one-man management" to be 
replaced by a "collegial management" and the role of specialists and technicians 
to be reduced. The Workers' Opposition emphasised that the development of 
production under post-revolutionary conditions was an essentially social and 
political problem whose solution depended on the deployment of the creativity 
and initiative of the labouring masses, and that this problem is not merely 
administrative and technical. It denounced the increasing bureaucratisation of 
the State and of the Party (already at this time, all posts involving 
responsibility of the least importance were filled by nomination from above and 
not election), as well as the growing separation of the Party from the workers.</p>

<p class="fst">On certain points, it is true, the ideas of the Workers' 
Opposition were confused, and on the whole the discussion seems to have taken 
place on a formal level, just as the solutions proposed by both sides were also 
formal rather than substantive (the substance, in any case, had already been 
decided on elsewhere than in the Party Congresses). Thus, the Opposition (and 
Kollontai in her text) did not distinguish clearly between the (indispensable) 
role to be played by specialists and technicians qua specialists and 
technicians, under the control of workers, and the transformation of these 
specialists and technicians into unchecked [<i>incontrôlés</i>] managers of the 
production process. It developed a general critique of specialists and 
technicians without differentiating between the two categories, thus leaving its 
flanks exposed to the attacks of Lenin and Trotsky, who had an easy time showing 
that there could not be factories without engineers. From this position of 
advantage, Lenin and Trotsky came to the astonishing conclusion that this was a 
sufficient reason to entrust these engineers with dictatorial managerial powers 
over the whole operation of the factory. The Opposition fought ferociously for 
"collegial," as opposed to "one-man" management, a fairly formal aspect of the 
problem (a collegial form of management can be just as bureaucratic as one-man 
management), leaving in the shadows real problem, that of the true source of 
authority. Thus was Trotsky free to say, "The independence of the workers is 
determined and measured, not by whether three workers or one are placed at the 
head of a factory, but by factors and phenomena of a much more profound 
character."<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> This absolved him from having to discuss the real problem, which 
is that of the relationship between the "one" or "three" men and the 
collectivity of producers in the enterprise.</p>

<p class="fst">The Opposition also showed a relative amount of trade-union 
fetishism at a time when the unions had already fallen under the practically 
complete control of the Party bureaucracy.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The continuous 'independence' of the trade-union movement, in 
the period of the proletarian revolution, is just as much an impossibility as 
the policy of coalition. The trade unions become the most important economic 
organs of the proletariat in power. Thereby they fall under the leadership of 
the Communist Party. Not only questions of principle in the trade-union 
movement, but serious conflicts of organisation within it, are decided by the 
Central Committee of our Party."<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This being written by Trotsky in response to Kautsky's criticism 
of the anti-democratic character of Bolshevik power, Trotsky had no reason to 
exaggerate the extent of the Party's grip over the trade unions.</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, despite these weaknesses and despite this relative 
confusion, the Workers' Opposition posed the real problem: Who is to manage 
production in the "Workers' State"? And it provided the correct answer: the 
collective organs of labouring people. What the party leadership wanted, what it 
had already imposed - and on this point there was no difference between Lenin 
and Trotsky - was a hierarchy directed from above. We know that this was the 
conception that triumphed. We know, too, where this "victory" led.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="h11">[8. On "Ends" and "Means"]</a></h2>

<p class="fst">In the struggle between the Workers' Opposition and the 
leadership of the Bolshevik party, we witness how the two contradictory elements 
of Marxism became dissociated. These two elements had coexisted in a paradoxical 
fashion in Marxism generally and in its incarnation in Russia in particular. For 
the last time in the history of the official Marxist movement, the Workers' 
Opposition made audible this appeal to the masses to act on their own, this 
confidence in the creative capacities of the proletariat, this conviction that 
with the socialist revolution commences a genuinely new period in human history, 
in which the ideas of the preceding period barely retain any of their value and 
in which the edifice of society is to be rebuilt from the roots up. The 
Opposition's theses constitute an attempt to embody these ideas in a political 
program concerning the fundamentally important domain that is production.</p>

<p class="fst">The triumph of the Leninist outlook is the triumph of the other 
element of Marxism, which, to be sure, had long since - and even in Marx himself 
- become the dominant element in socialist thought and action. In all Lenin's 
speeches and writings of this period, what recurs again and again like an 
obsession is the idea that Russia ought to learn from the advanced capitalist 
countries; that there are not a hundred and one different ways of developing 
production and labour productivity if one wants to emerge from backwardness and 
chaos; that one must adopt capitalist methods of rationalisation" and management 
as well as capitalist forms of work "incentives." All these, for Lenin, are just 
"means" that apparently could freely be placed in the service of a radically 
different historical end, the building of socialism.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus Trotsky, when discussing the merits of militarism, came to 
separate the army itself, its structure and its methods, from the social system 
it serves. What is criticisable in bourgeois militarism and in the bourgeois 
army, Trotsky says in substance, is that they are in the service of the 
bourgeoisie. Except for that, there is nothing in them to be criticised. The 
sole difference, he says, lies in this: "<i>Who is in power?</i>"<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> 
Likewise, the dictatorship of the proletariat is not expressed by the "form in 
which individual economic enterprises are administered."<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The idea that like means cannot be placed indifferently into the 
service of different ends; that there is an intrinsic relationship between the 
instruments used and the result obtained; that, especially, neither the army nor 
the factory are simple "means" or instruments," but social structures in which 
are organised two fundamental aspects of human relations (production and 
violence); that in them can be seen in condensed form the essential expression 
of the type of social relations that characterise an era - this idea, though 
perfectly obvious and banal for Marxists, was totally "forgotten." It was just a 
matter of developing production, using proven methods and structures. That among 
these "proofs" the principal one was the development of <i>capitalism</i> as a 
social system and that a factory produces not so much cloth or steel but 
proletariat and capital were facts that were utterly ignored.</p>

<p class="fst">Obviously, behind this "forgetfulness" is hidden something else. 
At the time, of course, there was the desperate concern to revive production as 
soon as possible and to put a collapsing economy back on its feet. This 
preoccupation, however, does not fatally dictate the choice of "means." If it 
seemed obvious to Bolshevik leaders that the sole effective means were 
capitalist ones, it was because they were imbued with the conviction that 
capitalism was the only effective and rational system of production. Faithful in 
this respect to Marx, they wanted to abolish private property and market 
anarchy, but not the type of organisation capitalism had achieved at the point 
of production. They wanted to modify the <i>economy</i>, not the relations 
between people at work or the nature of labour itself.</p>

<p class="fst">At a deeper level still their philosophy was to develop the 
forces of production. Here too they were the faithful inheritors of Marx - or at 
least one side of Marx, which became the predominant one in his mature writings. 
The development of the forces of production was, if not the ultimate goal, at 
any rate the <i>essential means</i>, in the sense that everything else would 
follow as a by-product and that everything else had to be subordinated to it. 
Men, as well? Men, too, of course. "As a general rule, man strives to avoid 
labour ... man is a fairly lazy animal."<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> To combat this indolence, all means 
of proven effectiveness must be put to work: compulsory labour - whose character 
changes completely when it is imposed by a "socialist dictatorship"<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> - and 
available technical and economic means:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Under capitalism, the system of piece-work and of grading, the 
application of the Taylor system, etc., have as their object to increase the 
exploitation of the workers by the squeezing out of surplus value. Under 
socialist production, piece-work, bonuses, etc., have as their problem to 
increase the volume of social product, and consequently to raise the general 
well-being. Those workers who do more for the general interests than others 
receive the right to a greater quantity of the social product than the lazy, the 
careless, and the disorganizers."<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This isn't Stalin speaking (in 1939); it is Trotsky (in 1919).</p>

<p class="fst">The socialist reorganisation of production during the initial 
period is inconceivable without some "work obligation" - who does not work does 
not eat. That is certain. There probably also will be an attempt to standardise 
the amount of effort furnished by various shops and enterprises, which would 
require the establishment of certain norms and indices of work. All Trotsky's 
sophisms about the fact that "free labour" has never existed in history and will 
not exist until there is full communism should not make anyone forget, however, 
the crucial question: <i>Who</i> establishes these norms? <i>Who</i> controls 
people's work obligations, and <i>who</i> punishes those who do not fulfil these 
obligations? Will it be the organized collectives of labouring people? Or a 
specific social category, whose function therefore is to manage the work of 
others?</p>

<p class="fst">To manage the work of others - this is the beginning and the end 
of the whole cycle of exploitation. The "need" for a specific social category to 
manage the work of others in production (and the activity of others in politics 
and in society), the "need" for a separate business management and for a Party 
to rule the State - this is what Bolshevism proclaimed as soon as it seized 
power, and this is what it zealously laboured to impose. We know that it 
achieved its ends. Insofar as ideas play a role in the development of history - 
and,<i> in the final analysis</i>, they play an enormous role - the Bolshevik 
ideology (and with it, the Marxist ideology lying behind it) was a decisive 
factor in the birth of the Russian bureaucracy.</p>

a peculiar course that it <i>has given birth</i> in 1918 to two unconnected 
halves of socialism existing side by side like two future chickens in the single 
shell of international imperialism. In 1918 Germany and Russia have become the

productive and the socio-economic conditions for socialism, on the one hand, and 
the political conditions, on the other" (V. I. Lenin, " 'Left-Wing' Childishness
