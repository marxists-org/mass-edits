<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p class="fst">The present pamphlet may be an occasion for much misunderstanding and even dissatisfaction. People who sympathise with the trend of <a href="../../../../glossary/periodicals/z/e.htm#zemlya-volya"><strong>Zemlya i Volya</strong></a> and <strong>Chorny Peredel</strong> (publications in the editing of which I used to take part) may reproach me with having diverged from the theory of what is called <a href="../../../../glossary/terms/n/a.htm#narodism">Narodism.</a> The supporters of other factions of our revolutionary party may be displeased with my criticism of outlooks which are dear to them. That is why I consider a short preliminary explanation necessary.</p>

<p>The desire to work <em>among the people</em> and for the people, the certitude that &#8220;the emancipation of the working classes must be conquered by the working classes themselves&#8221; &#8211; this <em>practical</em> tendency of our Narodism is just as dear to me as it used to be. But its <em>theoretical</em> propositions seem to me, indeed, erroneous in many respects. Years of life abroad and attentive study of the social question have convinced me that the triumph of a spontaneous popular movement similar to Stepan Razin&#8217;s revolt or the Peasant Wars in Germany cannot satisfy the social and political needs of modern Russia, that the old forms of our national life carried within them many germs of their disintegration and that they cannot &#8220;develop into a higher communist form&#8221; except under the immediate influence of a strong and well-organised <em>workers&#8217;</em> socialist party. For that reason I think that besides fighting absolutism the Russian revolutionaries must strive at least to work out the elements for the establishment of such a party in the future. In this creative work they will necessarily have to pass on to the basis of modern socialism, for the ideals of Zemlya i Volya do not correspond to the condition of the industrial workers. And that will be very opportune now that the theory of Russian exceptionalism is becoming synonymous with stagnation and reaction and that the progressive elements of Russian society are grouping under the banner of judicious &#8220;Occidentalism&#8221;.</p>

<p>I go on to another point of my explanation. Here I will first of all say in my defence that I have been concerned not with persons but with opinions, and that my personal differences with this or that socialist group do not in the least diminish my respect for all who sincerely fight for the emancipation of the people.</p>

<p>Moreover, the so-called terrorist movement has opened a new epoch in the development of our revolutionary party &#8211; the epoch of <em>conscious political struggle</em> against the government. This change in the direction of our revolutionaries&#8217; work makes it necessary for them to reconsider all views that they inherited from the preceding period. Life demands that we attentively reconsider all our intellectual stock-in-trade when we step on to new ground, and I consider my pamphlet as a contribution which I can make to this matter of criticism which started long ago in our revolutionary literature. The reader has probably not yet forgotten the biography of Andrei Ivanovich Zhelyabov which contained a severe and frequently very correct critical appraisal of the programme and activity of the Zemlya i Volya group. It is quite possible that my attempts at criticism will be less successful, but it would hardly be fair to consider them less timely.</p>
