<h3>Note</h3>

<p class="note">Plekhanov envisaged his <strong>Essays</strong> as a series of articles for <strong>Neue Zeit</strong>, theoretical organ of the German Social-Democrats, already in 1892. The writing took him eighteen months, the work being completed towards the end of 1893.</p>

<p class="note">In May 1893 Karl Kautsky, the editor of <strong>Neue Zeit</strong>, thanked Plekhanov for his article on Holbach; but two months later, on July 19, 1893, on receiving the article on Helvetius and expecting an article on Marx, Kautsky wrote a letter to Plekhanov in which he expressed his doubt as to the possibility of publishing these essays in <strong>Neue Zeit</strong> because they were too long; he suggested that they should be published as a separate book. Kautsky&#8217;s letter of January 27, 1894 testifies to his having received Plekhanov&#8217;s last essay on Marx. The <strong>Essays</strong> were published then neither in <strong>Neue Zeit</strong> nor separately. Only in 1896 did they appear in book form in Stuttgart, under the title <strong>Beitr&#228;ge zur Geschichte des Materialismus. I. Holbach. II. Helvetius. III. Marx.</strong> The <em>Preface</em>, written by Plekhanov especially for their publication, was signed: &#8220;New Year&#8217;s Day, 1896.&#8221; In 1903, a second German edition was put out by the same publishers. The book did not appear in Russian in Plekhanov&#8217;s lifetime.</p>
