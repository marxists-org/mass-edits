<p class="fst">Dear Prime Minister,</p>
<p class="fst">For the first time
for many years there now seems a real possibility of some practical
steps being agreed on disarmament: public opinion is favourable, and
increasingly governments are recognising not simply that disarmament
is desirable but that it is both necessary and possible. This new
atmosphere is reflected in the unanimous resolution on general and
complete disarmament presented at the United Nations and by the
agreement reached for a summit meeting in May.</p>

<p>However, no one can
imagine that it will be easy to reach agreement or be sure that the
atmosphere will autocratically continue favourable. It is particularly
important that public opinion should not merely be for general
disarmament â€“ it must push for it firmly and continuously; showing
clearly that strength of purpose so graphically recognised in
President Eisenhower's remark to Mr. Macmillan: 'I think that the
people want peace so much that one of these days Governments had
better get out of their way and let them have it'.</p>

<p>But this calls for
consistent help and advice from leaders of opinion in all countries.
The goal of general disarmament under effective international
control, and the complete abolition of the cold war which this
demands, is common to the majority of people in all countries.
However, we need to know much more of how this objective can be
achieved, what are the reactions to existing proposals (such as the
very comprehensive plan for general and total disarmament with the
international control put before the General Assembly of UNO by Mr.
Khruschov) and how the questions affect the individual countries. In
particular, we need to ensure that the Summit Conference meets in an
atmosphere which will help towards solutions. In order to help
clarify and strengthen world opinion on these questions, we believe
it important that many leaders of opinion should now give their views
on them and that these views should be widely publicised.</p>

<p>It would be of great
interest if, in spite of the very heavy burden on your time, you
could let me have your comments on these questions. A statement by
you at this time would inform and encourage peace-lovers in many
countries and help to fortify public opinion in favour of
disarmament.</p>
