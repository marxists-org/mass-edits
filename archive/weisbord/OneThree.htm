<p><b>SEAMEN PREPARE FOR ACTION</b></center></p>

<p>The Marine Workers Provisional Action Committee is broadcasting the
following statement among the Marine Workers in different ports in the
United States:
<p>Today we have the greatest unemployment crisis that the world has ever
seen. So far as the United States is concerned the crisis will grow greater
and sharper the coming fall and winter. Make no mistake about it. Things
are going to grow much worse the end of the year for the workers.
<p>The employers are taking advantage of the terrible crisis, wages are
being slashed to the bone. Hours are being lengthened. On many lines the
two watch system is being established, crews are being cut down and work
speeded-up. Working conditions have become absolutely unbearable. It has
reached such a stage that in shear desperation the marine workers must
strike back.
<p>This fall and winter, then will see large strike struggles of the most
bitter character breaking forth. Already we see the signs of this coming
strike wave in the coal fields, in Penn., Ohio, Ky., W. Va., Ill., among
the textile workers in Lawrence, Allentown, Rhode Island, Paterson, etc.:
among the steel workers in Mansfield Ohio. If these workers can fight so
can we. The marine workers in Philadelphia, in New Orleans, in Duluth already
and in other ports have shown their willingness for struggle.
<center>
<p><b>Confusion Exists</b></center></p>

<p>Among the marine workers themselves the greatest confusion exists. The
workers are split up into many little unions. The International Longshoremen&#8217;s
Association, the International Seamen&#8217;s Union, the Marine Workers Industrial
Union, the Industrial Workers of the World all are fighting each other.
In many places, such as in New York harbor even smaller groups exist. In
the meantime the great mass of workers, 95% of us, are abandoned, helpless,
to meet the attacks of the ship and dock owners.
<p>What is to be done? First of all, all the advanced marine workers must
band themselves together to raise again the banner of struggle against
the bosses. Strikes must be led, marine workers organized. This is the
primary task. If the incompetent and faker officials of the existing unions
wont do it, we must do it.
<p>Secondly, we must raise the cry: ONE UNION IN THE MARINE INDUSTRY. We
are sick and tired of all these little sects dividing the workers. Let
all the unions of the marine industry come together. Let us have complete
amalgamation of all unions of marine workers. This is the second need of
the hour.
<p>We do not wish to destroy any union. We wish to amalgamate all the unions
on a common, fighting program.
<p>In order to raise the banner of struggle again, in order to prepare
for the coming strikes and to organize them, in order to fight for one
union we have organized a MARINE WORKERS ACTION COMMITTEE. Our aim is to
mobilize all the active members of each union so that all the unions will
come together to form one industrial union, and so that the unions will
take on a fighting character and organize and lead the forthcoming battles
of the marine workers. We must declare: OUT WITH THE INCOMPETENT AND FAKER
OFFICIALS OF THE UNIONS WHO STAND IN THE WAY OF UNITY OF THE MARINE WORKERS
IN THEIR STRUGGLES AGAINST THE BOSSES.
<p>In the meantime we cannot stand idly by and see the marine workers betrayed
and abandoned, unable to fight effectively. If the sects on the waterfront
cannot organize and fight, we ourselves must do so. The Marine Workers
Committee of Action, will organize the marine workers and carry on the
fight. If we organize the marine workers, if we carry on good work, we
will not send the workers into this or that or the other union. We must
organize a temporary holding body, a local of our own, not in order to
form a new union, but to see to it that the workers are protected, that
strikes are efficiently conducted, while at the same time we are fighting
for amalgamation of all unions in the industry into one on the basis of
a common fighting program of action.
<p>Fellow Marine Workers: Join US. Come to the conference to be held November
1<sup>st</sup> Sunday. 8 P.M. sharp at 212 East 9<sup>th</sup> Street,
New York City. RAISE THE BANNER OF STRUGGLE AGAINST THE BOSSES!

<p><b>PATERSON SILK STRIKE BRINGS OUT THOUSANDS</b>
<p>N.T.W.U. Leads Workers in Struggle</center></p>

<p>PATERSON&#8212;On July 22<sup>nd</sup> the National Textile Workers Union
called a strike in Paterson. For months (as we had pointed out in the June
issue of the<em> Class Struggle</em>) the situation had been very
favorable for strike action, due to the deplorable condition of the workers,
in spite of the economic depression.
<p>The general ripeness for strike action was rendered still more favorable
by the fact that decisive strikes had broken out in the silk mills of Allentown,
Pa. And Pawtucket and Central Falls R. I. The whole silk industry with
130,000 workers is concentrated in five regions (Rhode Island, Hudson County,
N. J., Paterson, Easton-Allentown, Pa., and the Anthracite region) and
with three of these five regions involved simultaneously in strikes, the
possibilities for a national tie-up and local victories were good.
<p>The four week Paterson strike has already shown that workers will strike
in periods of depression, and when viewed together with the strikes in
other textile centers and among the miners, the Paterson strike is a foreboding
of bigger and more significant strikes that are yet to come. There can
be no doubt but that we are approaching a big strike wave in this country.
<center>
<p><b>Spreading the Strike.</b></center></p>

<p>When the strike was called in Paterson by the N.T.W.U., only several
hundred workers responded. Soon however, the strike spread. On July 28<sup>th</sup>
the Associated Silk Workers Union, an independent organization amalgamated
with the United Textile Workers Union affiliated with the A.F. of L. also
called for a general strike in Paterson. The driving force for this amalgamation
was the Conference for Progressive Labor Action (Muste) and the Lovestone
Group of Communists.
<p>The Paterson employers did not object to this amalgamation for they
felt that the weak Independent Associated Union could not handle the situation
alone without the influence of the A.F. of L. and without united action
of all the bosses agents in the field. So long as the Communists were not
threatening, the bosses wanted two reformist insignificant unions in the
field so as to divide and confuse the workers, and to make sell-outs and
scabbery easy. But when the National Textile Workers Union begins to act,
as we have seen in Gastonia, in New Bedford, and in Passaic, the bosses
"holler&#8221; for the A.F. of L. and for a united front of all fakers.
<p>Here we must note carefully the role of the C.P.L.A., as the cementing
force aiding the Greens and the McMahons to sell-out the workers. The interesting
terms of this amalgamation can not be elaborated here although they show
to what lengths the A.F. of L. officials are now willing to go to unite
all forces against the Communists.
<p>At the time we go to press, the fourth week of the strike, it is estimated
that there are about 1000-1500 workers behind the National Textile Workers
Union and about 2000-2500 behind the Associated. Of the 14,000 broad silk
workers, perhaps the majority have struck but most of the workers, stay
at home and refuse to attend to the meetings of any of the unions.
<p>What is the reason for this anomalous situation? The Paterson workers
do not wish to scab, they do not wish to ignore the call of the picket
lines, they fully realize the necessity for strike action and a strong
union. But on the one hand, they know from bitter experience the strike
breaking role of the U.T.W. and Associated officials and on the other hand,
they have no confidence in the leadership of the N.T.W.U.
<center>
<p><b>Demands for all Workers</b></center></p>

<p>While the demands of the Associated really covers only the weavers and
ignores completely the poorer paid workers, the National Textile Workers
Union has full and complete demands for all sections of the workers. These
demands call for a 44-hour week (40 for night workers), a substantial increase
in pay (really only a demand for a restoration of the wage before the wage
cuts,) minimum wage, no more than 4 looms per weaver, no overtime, distribution
of work, recognition of the union etc. The demands of the union are modest
and comprehensive and no doubt have the overwhelming support of the workers.
Instead of working out these demands before the strike, however, the Communist
Party very foolishly put forward more radical demands from which it later
had to retreat, and it was only after much vacillation and confusion that
these demands were finally worked out.
<p>Picketing began immediately. The National Textile Workers Union began
to concentrate on the dye shops which employ 9,000 or so workers in and
around Paterson. The workers of the Colt dye shop were &#8220;pulled&#8221; out by
the National Union but they soon went back to work. No other dye shops
have joined the strikers. Soon after the Associated joined the strike the
workers of the key Dougherty mill were induced to strike and they joined
the Associated. This was a great victory for the Associated. It is the
first time that the workers of the Dougherty mill ever joined a union.
The fact that they struck and joined a union speaks volumes for the conditions
in Paterson. The fact that they joined the U.T.W. speaks volumes for the
criminal way in which the Communist Party has handled the strike.
<p>As in all strikes of this character, the police have been very partial
arresting only or mainly strikers. And picketers of the National Textile
Workers Union, (Clifton is an exception). The police now know that the
strike is being decisively controlled by the bosses agents in the U.T.W.
and Associated and so do not feel called upon to exercise their full might
against the strikers. Nevertheless they take no chances and have already
begun mass arrests of the N.T.W.U. picketers.
<p>The Paterson strike has become a prism reflecting all the colors of
the Communist groups in the United States. The Lovestone group has definitely
raised the yellow flag of centrism, revolutionary in phrase, yellow socialist
in action. Under the slogan of &#8220;work in the A.F. of L.&#8221; the Lovestone group
has done its best to cover the treachery of the officials of the A.F. of
L. It has provided the red paint for these fakers and sell-out artists
and has proven to be only a cloak to hide the treachery of the reformists.
Under the slogan of &#8220;unity&#8221; it rejects the united front with the N.T.W.U.
and unites all forces to kill the N.T.W.U. In no way have the Lovestone
Communists been different from the reformists in the C.P.L.A.
<center>
<p><b>Try to Break Strike</b></center></p>

<p>Aided by the Lovestoneites the A.F. of L. officials have tried to break
the strike. These bureaucrats did not want to strike; they tried to postpone
the strike call; they issued pessimistic statements about the readiness
of the workers to strike. As soon as the strike began the A.F. of L. officials
began to talk settlements and have already settled shops for almost 1000
workers. These early settlements of a few minor shops tend only to demoralize
the strike, and as was amply shown in the 1928 strike, these settlements
last but a few weeks when the same old conditions prevail.
<p>The whole orientation of the Associated officials is class collaboration
with the bosses. These officials declare that it is the policy of the union
to organize a Manufacturers Association to put &#8220;order&#8221; into the industry,
to get &#8220;stability&#8221; etc. These schemes to organize the bosses are but part
of the plan of the union heads to aid the bosses to rationalize the industry,
and to speed up the workers, etc. the officials are trying to prove to
the boss that a union pays bigger profits than no union. During the course
of the strike all efforts made by the N.T.W.U. to have unity in action
in the form of one strike committee, one central strike authority, one
set of picket lines, etc., have been rejected. The reformist officials
have done everything to split the strike and divide the workers.
<center>
<p><b>Errors of the Communist Party</b></center></p>

<p>As for the Cannon group, it is non-existent in Paterson. Sitting in
a quiet office, Cannon writes articles &#8220;warning&#8221; the party, but in Paterson,
no one reads the Militant and no one ever hears of Cannon. Then if the
workers do happen to do something good Cannon declares it was his influence
that made them change! What a joke this is! The Cannons do not enter these
fights because they are too old, because they do not wish to lose their
jobs, because they are not used to being in fights, because their members
do not demand this of them and they are used to getting leadership on a
silver platter. But such leaders can only lead the International Left Opposition
to destruction.
<p>In Paterson, the Communist Party displayed all the general errors for
which the party in now so well known. The workers have to pay heavily for
the right wing errors of the Communist Party leadership. We can summerize
the crimes of the Communist Party running the N.T.W.U. as follows:
<p>1. Absolutely no effective preparation was made for the strike. The
Party leaders thought that was necessary for a general strike was a general
leaflet or two, and a general mass meeting and that is all. No shop committee&#8217;s
had been built, no organization effected. Before the strike the Paterson
union and the N.T.W.U. had been allowed to fall down to a mere handful.
In the short time of eight months throughout the country about 6,500 members
had been lost to the N.T.W.U. after the expulsion of Weisbord and Buch
from the union. The Party leaders are not interested in building up a strong
union. Their support comes not from union dues but from Moscow, and so
long as cheerful dramatic reports can be sent over, what does it matter?
<p>2. No adequate leadership was given the strike. Foster, Johnston, Minor,
or such &#8220;big shots&#8221; are never seen to take responsible posts and to lead
mass movements so that the workers can judge them. They are good to come
in and make a speech especially when the movement has been &#8220;whipped up&#8221; for them, but they themselves are too yellow to appear in struggle. Instead
they send in immature youngsters like J. Rubin who adds to his immaturity
an incorrigible opportunism and an insupportable arrogance, to become &#8220;general&#8221; organizer. No real strategy was worked out for the strike. Instead of concentrating
on key weave shops and winning them first, since it was a broad silk workers
strike first of all, the Communists allowed the Associated Silk Workers
to take the initiative away from them and to win over the workers of Henry
Dougherty the key company in Paterson.
<center>
<p><b>Picketed Smaller Shops</b></center></p>

<p>Although no preparations or any organization whatever had been effected
in the dye shops, the few hundred &#8220;actives&#8221; in the union were forced to
throw away their strength in front of the dye shops, and then only the
smaller dye shops were picked on. Instead of relying on correct preparation,
reliance was placed on mass picketing &#8220;pulling out&#8221; workers. But 70 workers
or even 200 workers cannot &#8220;pull out&#8221; 400 at work who have never been approached
before. The result of each &#8220;pulling&#8221; was purely negative, no one came out
and those working even laughed at the picketers, some of them really wondering
what it was all about. At one time 200 workers of the Colt Dye Co. were
"pulled out&#8221; in this way. Almost at once they returned to work.
<p>3. Lack of militancy in the strike. In time of depression strikes can
not last too long. They must make up in intensity what they lack in duration.
But in the Paterson strike in no respect regarding picketing did the N.T.W.U.
really differ from the A.F. of L. When the police ordered the pickets not
to sing, in many cases they did not sing. Often the picket lines were broken
up into small futile lines. Not many workers could be induced to go on
the picket lines. Indeed the Associated had much larger picket lines. It
was they who carried signs &#8220;Don&#8217;t Scab". It was they who tested out the
right to picket in Clifton and were clubbed and some sent to the hospital.
It was they who were reported to have broken the windows of a mill where
there were scabs, etc.
<p>In no way could the workers distinguish between the reformist and the
so called revolutionary union in the field. Quite the contrary, while Budenz
and Holderman and Zimmerman of the Associated were arrested on the picket
lines, not so the J. Rubin&#8217;s! Even the real local leaders (Lieb, Kotzebuk,
Harris, Bart, Gershonowitz, et al) were not permitted much on the picket
line. (on the opportunist theory that since they had been framed for murder,
the best way for them to get out of their scrape was not to be seen before
the masses, but to lay down!)
<center>
<p><b>Did Not Win Associated Workers</b></center></p>

<p>4. Nowhere was the bankruptcy of the Party leaders seen so clearly as
in their complete failure to win any of the workers of the Associated over
to the N.T.W.U. The foolish &#8220;fascist&#8221; and &#8220;social f fascist&#8221; of the Stalin&#8217;s
and Foster&#8217;s put a great barrier between the workers of the two unions.
Violent language against the A.F. of L. without adequate proof, no effort
to organize a left wing within the A.F. of L. (Leaving this entirely to
the C.P.L.A. and to Lovestone), no effort to fraternize the workers of
both unions, no effort to bombard the workers of the right wing unions
with propaganda leaflets&#8212;a whole series of them being necessary, ---
no effort to join in action the picket lines of both unions, and thus compel
one picket line, to fuse the mass meetings of the Associated with workers
of the N.T.W.U. who would demand unity, etc.
<p>These failures prove the Communist Party was more eager to show the
officials did not want unity than really to get unity in action in the
strike.
<p>5. Failure to build a real united front and complete lack of democracy
in the union. This was no more clearly brought out than in the dealings
of the Communist Party with the representatives of the Communist League
of Struggle, Comrades Weisbord, and Buch. From the very beginning of the
strike the C.L.S. offered its unconditional support to the N.T.W.U. In
a letter to the N.T.W.U. the C.L.S. called on all the workers to rally
around the union and win the strike and that the C.L.S. would do all in
its power to help. This letter was never given to the strike committee.
Although a united front committee had been organized and Comrades Weisbord
and Buch were not allowed to be on this united front committee. All sorts
of rumors were spread among the workers that Weisbord was a stool pigeon
for the bosses and the A.F. of L. When Vera Buch went on the picket line,
a Communist Party member went by her side outside of the line and hollered
"Yellow dog, we don&#8217;t want you here, Yellow dog, get out of here, etc".
When it will be recalled that only recently Comrade Buch had faced the
electric chair for this very union and the workers knew this, it can be
understood how the workers felt when this took place.
<center>
<p><b>Weisbord beaten up</b></center></p>

<p>When Comrade Weisbord went on the picket line, the next day after being
greeted warmly by the workers, a group of Communist Party gangsters began
beating him up. When the workers rallied round, these gangsters fled. Several
times gangs were sent out to get Weisbord. All the other members of the
C.L.S. who went on the picket line regularly and who did everything they
could to help the strike were also hounded.
<p>After Comrade Weisbord had been arrested on the picket line and had
come from the court house to the mass meeting of the workers, he was beset
right in the meeting hall by gangsters organized by Steuben from New York.
The workers in the meantime had very warmly greeted the appearance of Weisbord
and wanted to know why he was not speaking and leading the strike. When
this beating took place the indignation of the workers knew no bounds.
One of the organizers, Batika took up a club and declared he wanted to
see who would lay a hand on Comrade Weisbord.
<p>The workers now know that Weisbord and Buch had been expelled without
a union trial under the most outrageous frame-up. They are demanding a
union trial for Comrades Weisbord and Buch, they are demanding a real democracy
in the N.T.W.U., the end of the gangster slugging tactics. The Communist
Party officials have become exposed as being petty politicians distorting
Leninism, standing against the real unity of the workers, slugging workers,
refusing to unite all those who really care to help.
<p>In the meantime the influence of the Communist League of Struggle is
growing by leaps and bounds. The Communist Party gangsters have been forced
to retreat. When Gil Green, head of the Y.C.L. started to speak denouncing
Weisbord as an enemy of the workers, even the chairman was forced to push
Green aside and have him sit down. The workers began to boo and stamp their
feet, and began calling on Weisbord to speak. Already the Communist League
of Struggle has gone a long distance in exposing the false line of the
party, and forcing the party to a correct stand.

<p>********************************</p>
<p><b>Class Struggle Denied U.S. Mailing Rights</b></center></p>

<p>On May 24<sup>th,</sup> several days after the June issue of the Class
Struggle had been sent through the mails, the Communist League of Struggle
was notified by the United States Post Office that it had been denied second
class mailing rights &#8220;because the application and other evidence in the
case show that the publication does not meet the requirements of the law
governing the admission of periodical publications to the second class
mail matter.&#8221; <p>The May and June issues of the Class Struggle had been mailed under
a temporary second class permit. When the U.S. Post office ruled that we
were barred from the second class postage, it confiscated the money we
had deposited pending the ruling on our application. To mail the paper
at present, great additional expense is incurred by the Class Struggle.
<p>When we used the temporary permit (May and June issues) only the bundle
orders were sent out, that way our subscribers were protected from the
government agents who are eager to lay their hands on the names and addresses
of militant workers. While the Daily Worker, Revolutionary Age and the
Militant help the government by making it easy for them to obtain the names
and addresses of Communists and militants, the Class Struggle protects
its readers to the maximum degree. The other papers are mailed in bulk
allowing the names to be copied!
<p>The Class Struggle in association with the Civil Liberties Union is
making another application for second class mailing rights. Whether we
succeed or not we will continue to publish the Class Struggle under any
or all circumstances. The present issue is being put out under great difficulties,
nevertheless we will carry on.
<p>The fight of the Class Struggle is your fight&#8212;the fight of all militant
workers. Now more than ever is its regular appearance necessary. Its suspension
under the first blows of the U.S. Post Office would be a defeat for the
entire American working class. The Class Struggle is a new paper, but already
the government attempts to suppress it, for it well understands the role
it will play in the future struggles of the American proletariat.
<p>Will you help us fight the government attack? Will you reply to the
post office ban&#8212;an indication of what we can expect from the recommendations
of the Fish Committee?
<p>The fight to publish the Class Struggle is not our fight alone, but
also your fight! Whether you are employed or unemployed, help to your utmost!
Funds are needed and needed now! Do not delay! Rush all money to the Class
Struggle, 212 East 9<sup>th</sup> Street, New York City.

<p>Letter To Revolutionary Age</center></p>

<p>The following letter has been sent to the Revolutionary Age in reply
to their letter to us!
<p>&#8220;Almost a month after the banning of our paper from the second class
mails we receive your letter in reply to ours calling for a preliminary
united front conference of all Communist groups. You write us that you
cannot attend such a conference but that we should send delegates to the
committee elected for the defense of the Revolutionary Age.&#8221; <p>&#8220;In the first place, permit us to state we never agreed with the policy
of the Communist League (Cannon group) not to send delegates to the conference
for the defense of the Revolutionary Age. It is our opinion that this should
be done by all working class groups, particularly Communists groups, since
the attack on the Revolutionary Age was part of the attack by the government
against the whole Communist movement. Differing from the Cannon group,
we have stated in our theses: (Class Struggle, May issue).&#8221; &#8220;In the meantime
the Communist League of Struggle must try to effect a united front so that
all Communist groups can work together on concrete issues on the basis
of the recognition of the Communist character of each group.&#8221; <p>&#8220;In the second place, the principle involved in the banning of the Class
Struggle is quite different from that involved in the Revolutionary Age.
In our case it is because we have refused to give the names and addresses
of our subscribers of the paper to the Post Office. We learned with the
greatest astonishment and indignation that the names and addresses of the
subscribers of the Militant and the Revolutionary Age and of other papers
have been turned over to the United States government by the responsible
leaders of the respective groups. We consider such action on the part of
the leaders of these groups as downright criminal. For our part we absolutely
refuse to give the list of names and addresses to the Fish Committee to
aid them in the raids and prosecutions that may be forthcoming. We are
fighting that a paper does not have to submit these names and addresses
before receiving second class mailing rights.&#8221; <p>&#8220;It is true that the government seized this ruling as a pretext in order
to ban our paper because of its revolutionary views. But you must appreciate
how important it is that the government does not register the Communists
and their sympathizers and how necessary it is to make the fight the Class
Struggle is now making.&#8221; <center>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Un-Communist Spirt</center></p>

<p>&#8220;In your refusing to send delegates to a preliminary conference called
by us, in your refusal for almost a month after the banning of our paper,
to print a line about it in the Revolutionary Age, in your idea that the
attack on the Revolutionary Age is the sole attack the government is making
on the revolutionary press, your organization has shown an un-communist
reluctance in engaging in the fight when other workers organizations are
attacked. In this respect you follow essentially the line of the Cannon
group, and of the official Party. However we are very grateful that weeks
following the New York Times, the Nation, the World Telegram and other
capitalist papers, the Revolutionary Age at last decided to print a line
or so to the effect that the United States Government has banned our paper
from second class mail.&#8221; <p>&#8220;We are very willing to send delegates to the committee for the defense
of the Revolutionary Age. We propose that the committee&#8217;s functions be
broadened. A new conference must be called, say within five weeks, to take
up essentially the new attacks that have been made on the revolutionary
press, particularly the attack on the Class Struggle and ways and means
must be worked out so that not only the Revolutionary Age but the Class
Struggle and all the other papers attacked may benefit by the work of the
conference and committee.&#8221; <p>&#8220;We want the speedy calling together of the committee so that we can
present our views and so that action can be taken on our proposals as soon
as possible on these matters.&#8221; <div align=right>"Albert Weisbord, Secy&#8221;</div>

<p><b>Legal Murder In Harlan, Ky.</b></center></p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to put the cold chills of steel down the backs of the criminal
element in the country&#8221; said States Attorney W.A. Brock of Harlan County,
Ky., in much the same manner we presume, as his gunmen have been scattering
the entrails of those &#8220;criminals&#8221; over the countryside with hot slivers
of lead.
<p>Upon thirty-five of these &#8220;criminals&#8221; (i.e. miners who dare to join
the N.M.U.) Brock has pinned over 102 murder indictments. The coal operators
are determined to teach the miner his place, and they feel that the electric
chair is an excellent tutor. The trial of Bill Burnett, charged with murder
is being rushed forward under the direction of the States Attorney and
the openly hostile trial Judge D.C. Jones. The bosses will spend money
and exert great effort to strap Burnett to the electric chair. We realize
that Bill Burnett&#8217;s chances to escape being legally murdered are exceptionally
slim and only the widest action on the part of the working masses can save
him and the other miners of Harlan charged with murder from sure death.
Judge Jones has already proclaimed his intention of having a carefully
hand picked jury and it is peculiar that on the eve of the Sacco-Vanzetti
murders, this prototype of Judge Thayer apes his progenitor almost word
for word.
<p>The I.L.D. is in the field (although the Militant seems to be unaware
of this) working for the defense of the miners in the clutches of the boss
controlled courts, but this defense of itself is not sufficient. A broad
united front of all workers organizations is necessary for the execution
of a real defense tactic. Remembering the martyrdom of Sacco and Vanzetti
we the workers must exert our efforts to the limit to prevent in this case,
history repeating itself.
<p>All over the country are workers facing death and imprisonment for daring
to resist the oppression of the boss. This terror that is sweeping the
country is cementing the workers more firmly together and in sequence the
workers are gaining in strength.
<p>Big issues have arisen in the Kentucky mine war and it is far from being
ended. The &#8220;hot seat&#8221; may burn the miners, the leaden slugs from the guns
of thugs may tear their bodies while starvation and filthy jail emaciates
them but the coal operators cannot break those workers spirits.

<p><b>The &#8220;Class Struggle&#8221; Is Banned</b></center></p>

<p>The Communist League of Struggle (adhering to the International Left
Opposition) may be a small group but already it has incurred the enmity
of the ruling class. The Communist Party may call us counter-revolutionists;
but the watch dogs of the capitalist class take no chances. They felt the
weight of our group in Passaic, in New Bedford, in Gastonia. They do not
want to feel its weight again if they can help it. They want to crush our
group while it is still young and weak. While the other Communist papers
now under the government ban received second-class mailing rights at least
for a while, we were denied these rights at the very beginning.
<p>The government wants to do two things: 1. Register every Communist and
Communist sympathizer in the United States. 2. Obliterate the views of
the Communists from the face of the earth. When a workers paper applies
for second class mailing rights, the Post Office demands the editor turn
over a list of the names and addresses of the subscribers of the paper.
That means, especially in the beginning, the names and addresses of every
member and sympathizer of the group. When the group does that, only then
does the government proceed to attack the paper openly for its views.
<p>We have refused to do just that. We have absolutely refused to give
the name and address of a single subscriber of our paper to the post office.
We have learned with the greatest astonishment and indignation that the
Cannons, the Lovestones, and other so-called Communist leaders ACTUALLY
HAVE TURNED OVER THEIR SUBSCRIPTION LISTS TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT,
TO THE FISH COMMITTEE!
<p>Comrades, workers, do you know what that means? It means that your own
leaders have turned you over to the enemy. It means that when the new Red
Raids and new attacks come, the ruling class knows just where to find you.
It will be no trouble at all, thanks to the leaders to whom you so confidently
entrusted your name and address.
<p>Here is a striking example of the criminal amateurishness of the Fosters
and Lovestones and Cannons. In order to save the few cents in mail they
are willing to turn over their membership lists to the capitalist government.
These people head the revolutionary movement only to behead it. If they
were stool pigeons they could not do worse.
<p>But what will you workers say when you learn that members of these groups
actually attacked us for our stand. That we were told by one Cannonite
we should turn over our lists, since they had done so? We can understand
that from Mr. Baldwin of the Civil Liberties Union, but we cannot understand
it from a Communist. Other &#8220;Communists&#8221; wisely advised us that since, that
if we used the second-class mailing rights, we would have to mail through
one station only and the government clerk could easily copy the names and
addresses of our subscribers from the wrapper we might as well turn over
our lists directly. We wish to declare that none of our subscribers need
worry on that score. No subscriber who in any way needed to be protected
has been sent a paper through the mails second-class. We sent our mail
out either first class or third class in such a way that it is practically
impossible for the post office clerk to copy our readers names and addresses.
<p>What will you workers say to the fact that when we wrote to the official
Communist Party and to the other Communist groups about the post office
attack and called them to a preliminary conference on joint action on this
and other matters, the Communist Party and the miserable Cannon group never
even replied to our letter? To this day the &#8220;Daily Worker&#8221; has not a word
to say on this attack. A long time after the event, weeks after the &#8220;New
York Times&#8221;, the &#8220;Nation&#8221;, the &#8220;World Telegram&#8221; and other capitalist papers
featured the news prominently, the &#8220;Revolutionary Age&#8221; and still later
the &#8220;Militant"&#8212;at last mentioned the fact in secondary articles.
<p>The &#8220;Militant&#8221; story finally appeared in the July 18<sup>th</sup> issue.
This story really aids the government attack against us. The &#8220;Militant&#8221; writes that the post office denied us second class mailing rights because
we did not have enough subscribers. The truth is, the post office denied
our application because we would not turn over our names and addresses
to it. Then to climax its lies, the &#8220;Militant&#8221; adds that the &#8220;Class Struggle&#8221; has been suspended. Of course, Schactman and his friends would like nothing
better than our death. In this they agree with the government. For foreign
consumption the Schactman&#8217;s call for a united front against the governments
attacks. Yet they never even answered our letter calling for such a united
front.
<p>These events have taught us still more the bitter lesson: these Cannon&#8217;s,
Lovestone&#8217;s, Foster&#8217;s, must be driven out of the Communist movement!

<p><b>Current Comment</b>
<p>Continue the fight for the Scottsboro Boys!</center></p>

<p>By the International Labor Defense appealing the verdict to a higher
court, the eight Negro boys sentenced to death in Scottsboro, Ala. have
a temporary reprieve. Until the high court of the state of Alabama acts,
the youths condemned to the electric chair on a frame-up charge are secure,
(provided of course, a lynch mob does not break into the jail and hang
them). Further violence against the Negro masses is in the recent murdering
of three workers in Chicago at an unemployment demonstration.
<p>Two lessons should be learned from this case. First, that like all other
petty-bourgeois organizations, the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, in a critical situation shows its true colors. Even
such a so-called &#8220;radical&#8221; as William Pickens, who first favored a militant
fight to save the lives of the eight boys, is now doing his best to send
thei to their graves. Although Pickens, Walter White and the rest of the
N.A.A.C.P. tribe claim that they favor the liberation of the prisoners,
their every action proves just the opposite. In real Uncle Tom fashion,
they lick the boots of the Ku Klux Klan elements, hoping that they will
be so kind as to free the boys! As their attorney, they chose a member
of the Ku Klux Klan!
<p>Yet Herberg, editor, Revolutionary Age writes for the Crisis without
a word of criticism.
<p>As to the International Labor Defensa and the Communist Party which
began the campaign for the freedom of the boys and are today still in charge;
they have shown a narrow policy in their activities which is a menace to
the success of their plan.
<p>Although the I.L.D. stated that it wanted a broad united front to free
the boys and although the Daily Worker printed many editorials in a similar
vein&#8212;actually it is conducting its work in a sectarian manner. The
Communist League of Struggle had delegates at the New York conference for
the Scottsboro defense and pledged money and full resources. While our
aid was not openly denied on the floor, all of our offers have since been
ignored. Our letters pledging funds, etc. have not even been answered.
<p>The militant workers must save the Scottsboro boys! The Negro masses
must repudiate the murderous role of the N.A.A.C.P.! The recent Chicago
"riots&#8221; show how the Negro&#8217;s can really fight.
<p>The Communist workers must condemn the criminal line of the I.L.D.!
<p>All those who believe in snatching the eight boys from the electric
chair must unite their forces! Let us save them from the clutches of the
master class!

<p>The Centralia Meeting A Valuable Lesson</center></p>

<p>A clear indication of the tactics and program of the Lovestone and Cannon
groups as opposed to the Communist League of Struggle can be found by examining
the Centralia protest meeting arranged by the I.W.W. and held in Union
Square on June 13.
<p>The C.L.S. as well as the Lovestone and Cannon group were invited to
have speakers at the meeting, the chairman, a member of the I.W.W. announced
that the official Communist Party had not been invited to participate.
The Cannon group, which had accepted the invitation only as a gesture,
immediately used this statement as an excuse to withdraw. They sent a written
message to the chairman stating that they would not speak, (Cannon had
been advertised to speak but actually Swabeck scheduled to represent that
right wing outfit). Cannon will not speak at any open air meeting, on the
ground that he may lose his job! A fine example for a &#8220;leader&#8221; of the Communist
"vanguard&#8221; to set for the members and sympathizers of this group.
<p>The Communist and left wing workers at the meeting were angry at the
sectarian attitude taken by the I.W.W. When Weisbord, representing the
C.L.S. spoke, he sharply attacked the line adopted by the I.W.W. officials
and called for a real united front including the official Communist Party.
This brought tremendous applause from the assembled workers, members of
the official Party joining in the demonstration!
<p>While Cannon and Swabeck adopted a policy of retreating from the workers
and leaving the I.W.W. in command of the situation, the C.L.S. adopting
a Leninist position stood its ground in the united front and attacked the
wrong line of the I.W.W. before the workers.
<p>Weisbord linked up the arrests of the Centralia workers with the general
offensive against the labor movement in 1919 and called for the organization
of the unorganized at the present time. Vera Buch also spoke as a representative
of the C.L.S. and compared the Centralia case with Gastonia.
<p>Gitlow of the Lovestone group did not criticize the wrong line of the
I.W.W. nor did he mention any of the present accomplishments of the Communist
movement.
<p>Let the militant workers use this one meeting to make their choice:
either the right wing lines of Cannon, Lovestone and the official Party,
or the Leninist position of the Communist League of Struggle.

<p>Marxian&#8212;Leninist Education in the United States</center></p>

<p>Although hastily arranged in March when the Communist League of Struggle
was organized, the classes of our workers school have been unusually successful.
More than 30 workers attended the class in volume one of Marx&#8217;s Capital,
the most popular of them all.
<p>For the Fall term, our School has an ambitious program&#8212;ten classes
in all. For the first time in the history of the American labor movement,
classes in the three volumes of Capital will be taught. There will also
be a class in the works of Lenin; a complete study of the writings and
teachings of the foremost revolutionary leader of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.
Another course never before given for American workers will be one on the
theses and resolutions of all the congresses of the Communist International.
Other classes will take up the history of the American working class, dialectical
materialism, problems of strike strategy and tactics, political trends
in the labor movement, workers correspondence and public speaking.
<p>It is indeed significant that only the Communist League of Struggle,
which emphasizes the importance of mass work as opposed to the sectarianism
of Cannon and Co. cloaked under the slogan of &#8220;propaganda society,&#8221; likewise
stresses the importance of education in the fundamental works of Marx and
Lenin. To us there is no dividing line between education and practice.
They both work together.
<p>For the first time the Communist and left wing workers in the United
States have an opportunity of an all-inclusive working class education
by attending the classes of our workers school. We hope to have a minimum
of 100 students. Registration starts August 15, and all workers who want
to be fully equipped to participate most effectively in the class struggle
are urged to register for several of the classes.

<p>Maurice Malkin Rejoins the Party</center></p>

<p>Maurice Malkin, the first rank and file worker expelled from the Party
in 1928 for supporting the line of Leon Trotsky and the Left Opposition
has broken with the Cannon group and reapplied for membership in the Party.
<p>Why has Comrade Malkin taken this step? Disgusted by the sectarian line
of the right wing Cannons and Schactmans and deprived of any responsible
work in the Cannon group because its leadership knew that he had sharp
disagreements with them. Comrade Malkin in sheer depression has asked to
be taken back into the Party.
<p>We feel sure that Comrade Malkin realizes that the Party under the leadership
of the Stalin&#8217;s and the Foster&#8217;s will not carry out the line of Lenin,
the program of Marxism. Malkin&#8217;s capitulation is a reaction to the bureaucratic
actions of the Cannons.
<p>When the writer was up for expulsion in the Cannon group for opposing
its sectarian line, its national committee forced Malkin to speak and vote
for this expulsion. Here are real Stalin methods for you!
<center>
<p>************************************</p>
<p><b>My Expulsion from the Communist Party</b></center></p>

<p>The reasons for my expulsion from the Communist Party are still a mystery
to many party members and sympathizers. My expulsion is not a personal
matter. It has given our enemies many a good laugh, as for example, the
Jewish Daily Forward. It is a good example of the rudeness and disloyalty
of Stalin and his henchmen, and the corrupt bourgeois methods with which
they have dominated the Party.
<p>When I joined the Communist Party in 1924, I had at once been forced
to plunge into the factional fighting then raging within the Party. Ostensibly
the fight was over the question of a Labor Party. But the methods used
by the various cliques (Foster, Cannon, Lovestone, Weinstone) soon demonstrated
that this was not a Communist fight but an unprincipled fight for power.
On the one side stood a group of intellectuals, MELAMUDS (Hebrew teachers)
e.g., Bert Wolfe, Bert Miller, Weinstone, Bedacht, Stachel, et. al. On
the other side stood a group of MANDARINS (bureaucrats) who had learnt
well all the corrupt practices in the A.F. of L. and who were carrying
them into the party (Foster, Johnstone, Cannon, Dunne, et. al.)
<p>It was for this reason that as soon as I had registered my opinion with
the Ruthenberg group that I left all these factional wranglings and taking
the Comintern slogan &#8220;To the Masses&#8221; seriously got a job in a textile mill,
learned how to weave silk, transferred to Paterson and began the work of
organizing the masses and building the party.
<p>Up to the time of my expulsion, no one had accused me either of socialist
opportunistic tendencies or of an incorrect line in these strikes, or of
a wrong attitude to my work, or of bureaucratism.
<center>
<p><b>Why The Expulsion?</b></center></p>

<p>How, then, could it be I was expelled, the incredulous reader will ask?
Yet the answer is relatively simple. The longer I remained in the Party,
the higher up I went in the Party councils, the more I saw of the most
rotten corrupt Tammany Hall practices engaged in by all the factional cliques
inside the Party. The more I participated in mass work, the more I saw
the yellowness, the incapacity, the frivolity, the opportunism of those
so-called &#8220;Communist leaders". I began a struggle against the charlatanry
of the unprincipled factional fighting, against the bourgeois conduct of
our &#8220;leaders". I began to demand that the leaders of the Communist Party
go into mass struggles also and take serious responsible posts in the thick
of the fight.
<p>This was the real reason for my expulsion: my declared lack of confidence
in the leadership and my demand that no one reach leadership unless first
having participated in mass struggles and behaved as a foremost Communist
in those struggles. However, the Party leaders could not give this for
the reason for my expulsion. They had to find other reasons. And so they
resorted to lies and to the frame-up.
<p>The first charge made against me was I was a Lovestoneite. Here are
the facts:
<p>1. With the death of C. E. Ruthenberg I separated myself ideologically
from all groups. For this I was removed by Lovestone from Detroit where
I was District Organizer at the time, and not made a member of the Central
Executive Committee.
<center>
<p><b>Broke With Gitlow</b></center></p>

<p>2. Sent to the Profintern congress in 1928 I there broke formally with
Gitlow and presented my own opinions of the defects of the American Communist
Party. When the 6<sup>th</sup> Congress of the Communist International
was held I sent across my own views disagreeing with Lovestone on the question
of the strength of American imperialism, radicalization, trade union tactics
etc. (Letter to Lovestone C.P. secretary, June 11<sup>th</sup> 1928).
<p>3. Throughout my trade union work I constantly fought the opportunism
of Lovestone in Passaic, in New Bedford, in Paterson, in Detroit, etc.
<p>4. Before the 1928 convention I wrote a programmatic article which appeared
in the Daily Worker (January 1929) and which had in its title the slogan:
"Criticize the too many right wing errors of the C.E.C.&#8221; <p>5. When the open letter came with the organizational instructions calling
for the removal of Lovestone, while very much opposed to Foster as being
just an opportunist as Lovestone, I welcomed this removal as a blow to
opportunism and unprincipled factionalism (Letter to Party Secretariat,
March 15<sup>th</sup> 1929).
<p>6. After the removal of Lovestone I sent the following telegram: (May
25<sup>th</sup>) &#8220;Comintern address very timely and necessary. It definitely
smashes the old clique rule of the petty- bourgeois politician officialdom.
The Political Committee decision printed Monday&#8217;s Daily Worker not strong
enough.
<p>&#8220;It did not emphatically condemn as it should have, the anti-Comintern
slanderous splitting policy of Lovestone, Gitlow, and all others involved.
Whole Party must intensify the struggle to clear out all remnants of rotten
opportunism inside the Party. I am convinced the whole rank and file now
no longer misled are now completely and enthusiastically for the C.I. policy".
<center>
<p><b>Did Not Print Telegram</b></center></p>

<p>This telegram was never printed. The Stachels and the Minors, good swindlers
for Lovestone, feeling that this telegram was directed at them were already
laying the basis for the frame-up, my expulsion as a Lovestoneite.
<p>7. Finally here is part of the text of a resolution drawn up by me in
Gastonia June 11, 1929 (and signed by Jim Reid of the N.T.W.U.
<p>&#8220;1. We enthusiastically welcome the open address of the C.I&#8230;&#8230;.We
strongly condemn the anti-Comintern slanders&#8230;&#8230;.of Lovestone&#8230;&#8230;.
<p>&#8220;2. Our main tasks while fighting all splitters of every description
now are the cleaning out of all remnants of factionalism and rotten diplomacy
within the Party and the throwing of our entire and leadership into mass
work.
<p>&#8220;3. In accomplishing our tasks we must recognize the most serious mistakes,
yes, crimes that our leadership has perpetrated. The present leadership
not only has kept our party an isolated sect, but it has for years continuously
misled the honest proletarian members of our party, driving away many thousands
of them from our party.&#8221; <p>8. When after I was expelled, Herberg of the Lovestone group tried to
capitalize on it, and in an article in the right wing International Bulletin
claimed I was supporting the opposition. I wrote the following letter to
Herberg and to Brandler (May 21, 1930)&#8212;a letter which Brandler printed
but not Herberg. &#8220;Everyone knows that I was removed not because I supported
the opposition, but quite the reverse, because I declared the present leadership
(Foster et al.) was in essence no better than the opposition. Further it
is equally well known that I am not a member of the opposition and differ
from it on many questions.
<center>
<p><b>The Desertion Charge Exposed</b></center></p>

<p>The second charge against me is that I deserted my post in the Textile
Workers Union at a critical moment of the struggle in the South. What are
the facts?
<p>1. On June 5<sup>th,</sup> two days before the shooting took place in
Gastonia, I had informed Foster that due to my complete lack of confidence
in his opportunist leadership, due to the fact that the C.I. called for
a struggle against the petty-bourgeois rotten diplomacy which he embodied
(see C.I. address 1929). It was impossible for me to accept responsibility
for the textile work and that I would tender my resignation at the next
meeting of the union fraction as party representative, and what would follow
as a matter of course as national secretary of the N.T.W.U.
<p>2. On June 7<sup>th</sup> the shooting took place. As soon as I heard
of it, June 8, I at once got the party secretariat to meet and I made the
motion that &#8220;I should proceed immediately to Gastonia to stay a minimum
of three weeks to take charge of the situation in the field until matters
became normalized and the crisis due to the murder frame-ups was over&#8221; (Minuets Secretariat June 8<sup>th</sup>, 1929). The secretariat passed
this motion but decided I could leave Sunday June 9<sup>th</sup> as the
National Executive Committee of the N.T.W.U. had been called in for June
8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup>. I again informed the secretariat I would
announce my resignation as party textile representative to the Communist
fraction which was to meet before the N.E.C. meeting of the union.
<center>
<p><b>Motion Voted Down</b></center></p>

<p>3. On June 9<sup>th</sup> the Communist fraction of the N.E.C. met.
They approved the decision that I go to Gastonia. I then moved that I be
given a leave of absence till the union convention, it to be understood
to mean resignation. BUT THAT THIS WAS NOT TO TAKE EFFECT TILL MY RETURN
FROM THE SOUTH. The Communist fraction (present Keller, Reid, Dawson, Chernoff,
Michelson, and others), UNANIMOUSLY VOTED MY MOTION DOWN. As a Communist
I accepted the decision. I DID NOT OFFER MY RESIGNATION AT THE N.E.C. MEETING
OF THE UNION.
<p>4. On June 9<sup>th</sup> I immediately left for the south, having given
up my room and stored my things. A large group of Comrades saw me to the
train. Jim Reid and Ellen Dawson went with me.
<p>5. I arrived in Charlotte, N.C. Monday morning June 10<sup>th</sup>.
A large party fraction was there (among others, Poyntz, WagenKnecht, Dunne,
Crouch, Trumbull, Reid, Dawson). At the fraction meeting I moved that Reid,
Dawson and myself at once enter Gastonia in spite of the great danger of
lynching for the workers must see that the union is not afraid. Dunne moved
that only Poyntz go on the ground that she is a woman and would not be
lynched and also on the &#8220;political&#8221; ground that it is now a defense case
and the I.L.D., not the union must take the lead. When this motion seemed
doomed to fail, Dunne moved another that only one person go at a time and
he presented a list (with himself not too far in front). Taking the authority
given me by the C.E.C. as textile representative I declared that the union
representatives would go in first and that settled the matter.
<center>
<p><b>Return Is Demanded</b></center></p>

<p>6. The next morning June 11<sup>th</sup> , Reid, Dawson and I were all
ready to go from Charlotte to Gastonia when we received a telegram to me
signed by Robert Minor, the acting secretary of the Communist Party and
dated June 10<sup>th</sup>. The telegram read: &#8220;You are instructed to return
immediately.&#8221; As soon as possible I called a fraction meeting to take up
this telegram. The fraction unanimously decided I should not return, that
it would harm the work very seriously as I was the only one with central
authority in the field for the union. When we informed the secretariat
in New York we received two long distance phone calls categorically demanding
I return by the next train. There was nothing to do but for me to return.
<p>7. As soon as I returned to New York City I demanded that I be allowed
to go back at once. The necessity for my immediate return to Gastonia was
made greater when soon after both Ellen Dawson and Jim Reid returned. This
meant that there was absolutely no union organizer in the field at all.
And this condition remained until only 10 days before the trial. It took
Bill Dunne over 14 days before he ventured to go into the city of Gastonia
from Charlotte. To my plea to be allowed to return, the secretariat merely
ordered me to stand trial before it next week.
<center>
<p><b>Charged With Running Away!</b></center></p>

<p>What was my astonishment to learn when I appeared before the secretariat
that I was charged with running away from the south! And it was for this
I was removed from the C.E.C. and suspended from the Party, later expelled
by the C.I. How shall we designate this if not by the term frame-up?
<p>8. Soon afterwards the Secretariat ordered a fraction meeting of the
N.T.W.U. At this fraction meeting Foster appeared and in the name of the
Party Secretariat demanded that I resign as national secretary of the union
and that he fraction vote for it. There followed a long discussion. The
fraction was not quite in harmony with this policy but after I declared
that I would not fight the order of the Secretariat, the fraction agreed.
At the N.E.C. meeting of the union I resigned. Now I am charged with resigning
from my post and expelled for that reason!
<p>9. Later the N.T.W.U. called a national convention in Paterson. I came
to the meeting. I was met at the door by a party committee who told me
that it was party orders that I was not to enter the hall as I was under
suspension and they thought the workers would give me an ovation, thus
upsetting the party&#8217;s plans for my elimination from the union. As a disciplined
Communist I obeyed. The next day in the Daily Worker there appeared an
article by Amter charging me with being too yellow to appear to face the
charges! And this while I was officially still a member of the party and
under its discipline!

<p><b>The Crisis in the International Left Opposition</b></center></p>

<p>The Communist League of Struggle in its recent statement has raised
a demand for the ousting of the present International Secretariat of the
Left Opposition. While our statement was based upon the dealings of the
Secretariat towards our group, yet the situation internationally substantiates
our attitude. The Left Opposition finds itself now in a crisis characterized
by deep dissension and by splits in some of the most important countries.
Among all the local and national questions which determine these splits,
among all the welter of personalities in the groups there runs a common
thread throughout in which we may distinguish two points: (1) opposition
to the International Secretariat for its bureaucratic, Stalinist line.
(2) Criticism of the Left Opposition groups as being too close to the line
of the official Communist parties.
<center>
<p><b>Split In Germany</b></center></p>

<p>In Germany, a split has recently occurred in the United German Left
Opposition which was built up in 1930 on the basis of a section of the
Urbahns group and several other local opposition groups. The Leipzig Executive,
headed by Comrade Well, now has the support of the Secretariat and of Comrade
Trotsky, and the Berlin Executive, has now become &#8220;unofficial&#8221; with its
leader, Kurt Landau, bitterly attacked by Trotsky. Landau is accused of
factional intriguing, of struggling to maintain power rather than to support
principle, of being in league with other groups not in the good graces
of the Secretariat, as the Gourget in France and certain Austrian sections.
Landau charges the change in leadership in the German opposition has been
made mechanically from above, against a majority vote of the membership.
He claims the Secretariat has withheld from publication documents he sent
them. He attacks the Leipzig group as sharing the errors of the official
C.P., first, in the question of fascism, not sufficiently realizing its
menace, believing it to be weakening and second, on its attitude towards
the Soviet Union, being insufficiently aware of the dangers developing
within the proletarian dictatorship, not understanding the &#8220;elements of
dual power.&#8221; <center>
<p><b>French Situation</b></center></p>

<p>In France, the Communist League (a group developed later than the early
Treint and Paz groups and not sharing the errors of these), has recently
sustained a split. A group led by Comrade Gourget has split away following
upon the disastrous tactic of the new Molinier-Frank leadership in the
miners strike, of issuing a slogan of &#8220;Back to work in a body&#8221; at a time
when the strike was holding its own and the union issuing a call for extension
of the strike. This is not however the only issue.
<p>The Gourget group were formally in leadership, but were accused of syndicalist
tendencies by the Secretariat, and were removed and supplanted by Molinier-Frank.
Trade union policies (especially in regard to the &#8220;Unitary Opposition&#8221; in the radical federation of labor (C.G.T.U.) have been a bone of contention.
The Gourget group have been accused of breaking down a Communist line by
taking in all workers into the Unitary Opposition, of being close to Monatte,
the syndicalist. On the other hand, this group accuses the other of making
the Unitary Opposition so narrow as to take in only members of the Communist
League (Opposition). When the Comintern made its turn to the right in 1930,
there was a dispute as to the nature of this turn. The Gourget group considered
it an opportunist turn, to be sharply fought; the other side hailed it
as a correction of the line.
<p>The opposition of the Gourget group goes deeper, however, than national
questions. It attacks the International Secretariat, while maintaining
adherence in principle to the Left Opposition. It charges the Secretariat
with bureaucratic dealings of a Stalinist character, in removing old and
installing new leadership&#8217;s, of withholding frank discussions, as to the
splits in different countries, of supplanting the International Bureau,
etc.
<center>
<p><b>The Austrian Groups</b></center></p>

<p>In Austria all three groups are now outside of the official Left Opposition.
Let us quote from a letter from Comrade Frey and 16 other comrades, to
the International Secretariat: (Militant, Jan 15, 1931) &#8220;Since their visit
to Vienna, we announced to comrades Molinier and Mille that while being
in political agreement&#8212;the political agreement still exists now ---
we have for some time considered with growing doubt and without confidence
the false and dishonest organizational methods which Comrade Trotsky and
the International Secretariat employ in practice&#8230;&#8230;.. Consequently,
we formally withdraw our adherence to the International Left Opposition.&#8221; <p>Upon the local questions of all groups, lacking as we do complete information
in most cases, we do not feel equipped to take a stand. (Certainly the
meager, vague articles in the International Bulletin help but little.)
However, in regard to the International Secretariat, the attitude of other
groups appears to substantiate our original stand.
<p>In the first place, what is this Secretariat, who composes it, where
did it get its authority? Why the mystery, the withholding of names? (Is
it in order that these may be changed frequently, may be manipulated?)
Where is the free and full discussion of issues on the basis of which alone
a correct line can be developed?
<p>The German crisis comes to light only in Comrade Trotsky&#8217;s sudden bitter
attack upon his former representative, Landau, the French split in the
vague, puerile article of Bulletin number 5.
<center>
<p><b>Secretariat Exposed</b></center></p>

<p>On the American question, the statement of our group has exposed on
the part of the International Secretariat trickery and factionalism of
the worst sort. Knowing the sympathy for the Communist League of Struggle
which prevails in certain sections of the Cannon group, the Schachtman
clique in New York got the Paris clique to repudiate our group&#8212;of course,
just before the Cannon convention comes off in order to kill this sympathy.
<p>The Secretariat has never communicated with our group so much as by
a single word; our paper, our thesis, they have completely ignored. If
we are to be condemned by these great revolutionists (so great that their
names, their records, cannot even be known) then surely this should be
on the basis of a wrong line of our thesis, not on a mere speech of Comrade
Weisbord before a meeting of the Cannon group before the C.L.S. was formed.
<p>The Communist League of Struggle is in agreement&#8212;and even the Secretariat
must admit that we are in agreement&#8212;with the basic programmatic questions
which divide the Left Opposition from the Stalin and &#8220;Right&#8221; groups, on
the question of building socialism in one country, on permanent revolution,
and in the strategic and tactical questions which flow from this (Chiang-Kai-Shek,
Anglo-Russian Trade Union Council, rate of development in the Soviet Union,
etc.)
<p>&#8220;Nay more, we alone have actually carried forward the theory of permanent
revolution in the most vital question that faces the American Communist
movement&#8212;the Negro question.&#8221; <p>The Secretariat declares us to be &#8220;filled with confusion&#8221; upon &#8220;other
questions.&#8221; If these &#8220;other questions&#8221; are so vital, so programmatic, why
are they not declared so? Why does the Secretariat not analyze our thesis
in order to prove our &#8220;confusion?&#8221; <center>
<p><b>Want to Do Mass Work</b></center></p>

<p>Our real crime after all&#8212;and the chief basis of our differences
with the Cannon group&#8212;is that we desire to do mass work. The ridicule
and silly playing with words with which the Secretariat distorts our views
on this question cannot hide our real achievements in this field both past
and present. Do we see the Cannon group active as our group has been in
the Pocketbook workers strike, in the Paterson strike, taking part in every
united front of workers into which we are able to penetrate? And did not
Trotsky himself write the Cannon group upon the occasion of the Militant
first becoming a weekly? &#8220;In America, the situation is closer to that in
Belgium than to that in Germany. The essential task of the American Communists
consists of direct action upon the revolutionary elements of the class&#8221; <p>We are accused of wishing to form an &#8220;independent party&#8221; (God spare
us, an Urbahns deviation!) But our thesis makes it plain that we fight
for readmission of the C.L.S. as a group into the ranks of the official
party. But instead of sitting in an office and from a safe place on the
sidelines solemnly &#8220;warning&#8221; the party (which cares so much for our warnings,
oh yes!) of its errors, we believe it necessary to participate ourselves
in the struggles of the workers, in order to demonstrate in deeds the correctness
of our policies.
<p>Our adherence is not to this petty, scheming Secretariat, with its false
line: we demand the ousting of such a Secretariat. We demand honest and
full discussion on all questions of differences among the Left Opposition
groups. We adhere to the basic principles of the Left Opposition promulgated
by Comrade Trotsky, principles which we consider to be Leninist; for the
rebuilding of the Comintern, for the annihilation of the false and dangerous
national socialist theory of building socialism in one country, for the
transformation of the Left Opposition into a real fighting force capable
of carrying out its historic task so that leadership may be provided to
carry the proletarian revolution throughout the world to victory!&#8212;V.B.
<center>
<p>***************************************</p>
<p><b>Trotsky&#8217;s New Thesis on Russia</b>
<p>Statement of the Communist League of Struggle</center></p>

<p>The Communist League of Struggle cannot accept in its entirety the thesis
of Comrade Trotsky on the Russian question. While we are in agreement on
some fundamental points, yet the new thesis by Trotsky contains many inconsistencies
and theoretical implications impossible for a left section of the Communist
movement to adopt.
<p>We are in hearty accord with Comrade Trotsky as we have been in the
past on the following points:
<p>1. That the Soviet Union is a workers state, that the dictatorship of
proletariat still exists in the S.U.
<p>2. That we must rally to the unconditional defense of the S.U.
<p>3. That the growth of the socialist construction in the S.U. must only
accentuate the basic contradictions of the transition period (contradictions
between town and country, contradiction between general backwardness of
Russia and the tasks of socialist transformation and finally contradictions
between the existence of the workers state and its encirclement by world
capitalism.)
<p>4. The growing development of the economic strength of the S.U. makes
all the more necessary the dropping of the false theory of socialism in
one country, binds still more closely together the S.U. and the rest of
the world and shows still more clearly the reliance of the dictatorship
in the first workers state upon the international proletariat.
<p>5. Correct also are the points made by Comrade Trotsky that it is impossible
under the present conditions in Russia to liquidate the kulak as a class;
that collectivization under the conditions prevailing in Russia cannot
mean socialism, that the methods used by Stalin have increased the disproportion
in the five year plan.
<center>
<p><b>Maintains There Is No Party</b></center></p>

<p>Here however our agreement with the thesis of Comrade Trotsky must come
to an end for this thesis goes far beyond the above points. Comrade Trotsky
maintains that there is no longer a party in the S.U. today but only an
apparatus whose chief is Stalin. According to this thesis, in the period
from 1923-1931 there took place a complete liquidation of the dependence
of the apparatus upon the party and the plebiscitory degeneration of this
apparatus. In the first place, the thesis of Comrade Trotsky is filled
with inconsistencies on this question. In one part of the thesis he declares
the C.P. has been crushed by the bureaucracy, that it is &#8220;the incontestable
fact that the C.P. has ceased to be a party". In another part he says that
the bureaucracy is no longer dependent upon the party, thus declaring that
there is a party, although no longer in control of the apparatus.
<p>Can there be a proletarian dictatorship, or even a bourgeois &#8220;democratic&#8221; state without a party? This is impossible. Comrade Trotsky adduces no theoretical
argument how there can exist a proletarian dictatorship or even a bourgeois
democratic state without a party, for if the C.P.S.U. has been strangled
and there is no other party in existence then we have the singular phenomenon
of the S.U., a workers state, without a single party. Every class that
comes to power must express and realize its interests through a political
party. The political party represents the quintessence of the interests
of the class. It is possible to have a democratic state with many parties.
It is further possible that no one party will be dominant for the while
but that there will be temporarily a complete equilibrium of classes and
of parties so as to give rise to a personal dictatorship (Bonapartism).
To conceive of the proletariat putting forward a coordinated plan and achieving
successes of socialist construction without a party is impossible.
<center>
<p><b>Another Inconsistency</b></center></p>

<p>And here we meet with another inconsistency in the thesis of Comrade
Trotsky. On the one hand he agrees that there have been gigantic successes,
unprecedented tempos of growth as expressed in the five year plan, that
show the might of the socialist method of economy. Further he agrees in
one part of the thesis that &#8220;without the party socialistic construction
is not possible in the transitional epoch&#8221; and yet the central thesis of
Trotsky is, that the socialist reconstruction that has and is taking place
has taken place without a party.
<p>On what basis can it be said that the C.P.S.U. is not a PARTY? Certainly
the C.P.S.U. has all the forms of a party. It is an independent organization
of the vanguard. In and around the C.P.S.U. is the vanguard of the proletariat
and of the toiling masses. Lenin has laid down the characteristics that
enable us to tell when such an independent organization of the vanguard
is actually a PARTY. If the organization has a mass following and is supported
by the masses, if the organization reflects the interests of the masses,
if the organization answers every question on every phase of the struggle,
then it is a party. Certainly the C.P.S.U. lives up to these characteristics.
If it be said that under Stalin the C.P.S.U. does not reflect the basic
interests of the masses, we must declare that the C.P.S.U. has been able
to maintain still the dictatorship of the proletariat and whatever may
be the blunders and crimes of the C.P.S.U. leadership, the C.P.S.U. still
reflects on the whole the basic needs of the proletariat.
<p>Comrade Trotsky declares there is not a trace of party democracy. Local
organizations are selected and automatically reorganized by secretaries.
Local secretaries are appointed, Congresses arbitrarily postponed, delegates
selected from the top, every spark of those features which go to make up
the nature of a revolutionist crushed; Blumkins are shot down, Bessedovsky&#8217;s
direct the purging of the party, etc. We submit (1) that this evidence
is exaggerated. (2) That while some of the above is true in part, yet this
is not decisive as to whether there is a party.
<p>Comrade Trotsky maintains that in the S.U. the &#8220;apparatus&#8221; has strangled
and supplanted the party. This is an unfortunate and ambiguous expression.
The implications are that there is a completely uncontrolled bureaucracy
so huge as to crush the expressions of the proletariat. In the first place
we must point out such an &#8220;apparatus&#8221; would no longer be a mere &#8220;apparatus&#8221; but a political party. Such a political party would be a petty-bourgeois
party, composed of careerists and bureaucrats of all sorts, representing
the petty-bourgeois and bourgeois elements in the S.U. To state that the
apparatus now uncontrolled has strangled party is to state that a petty-bourgeois
party is heading the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is the same
as to say that there is a DICTATORSHIP OVER THE PROLETARIAT BY THE BUREAUCRACY
WHICH UP TO NOW IS STILL IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PROLETARIAT. Such a position
is absolutely impossible for a Leninist Communist group such as the C.L.S.
to hold.
<center>
<p><b>Democracy Under Dictatorship</b></center></p>

<p>It must be firmly borne in mind that so long as there exists a dictatorship
of the proletariat it means that a far wider democracy exists than could
possibly exist under the bourgeois. In the transition period between capitalism
and socialism, known as the dictatorship of the proletariat, already heavy
blows are given are given the state and the state begins to wither away.
This is seen in the fact that the people are fused with the army and the
state functionaries. There is far less bureaucracy in any state where the
workers rule than in any developed bourgeois state. We must bear this in
mind as the background to judge the effects of the growth of bureaucracy
which undoubtedly to a very great extent has increased under Stalin.
<p>Secondly, is it possible that a petty bourgeois enemy class party can
lead the dictatorship of the proletariat? (The &#8220;apparatus&#8221; uncontrolled
by the proletarian party, is such a petty bourgeois party both because
it reflects the interests of the property holders and because also the
bureaucrats themselves are part of a class&#8212;part of the petty bourgeois).
If this were possible, and it could not be for any length of time, it would
mean that the enemy class had given the most crushing blow to the proletariat,
crushed its leading party and substituted its own party for the party of
the proletariat. It would mean that the dictatorship of the proletariat
is so badly weakened that it is on its very last legs about to succumb
to the blows of the victorious property classes. Such a viewpoint overestimates
the strength of the enemy and underestimates the proletarian forces in
the U.S.S.R.
<p>Our conclusions then are in this regard:
<p>1. There is in the U.S.S.R. still a proletarian party, a Communist Party.
<p>2. There is no petty bourgeois party controlling the state.
<p>3. In spite of the unwinding of the revolution under Stalin, there is
still far greater democracy, far less bureaucracy in the U.S.S.R. than
in any capitalist state.
<p>4. Here we must also point out how correct the C.L.S. was in never adopting
Trotsky&#8217;s theory of &#8220;Centrism.&#8221; Centrism cannot be the designation of a
Communist grouping or tendency. Centrism is not a tendency that vacillates
between the right and the left. As Lenin defined it, it was a YELLOW SOCIALIST
TENDENCY, revolutionary in phrase, opportunist in practice.
<p>In one part of this thesis, Comrade Trotsky declares that the &#8220;right
wing&#8221; Communists represent the Thermidorian tendency, the &#8220;centrists&#8221;,
(Stalinists) the Bonapartist tendencies. Then he declares that Bonapartism
is a more open, riper, manifestation of bourgeois counter revolution than
Thermidor. This would mean that the &#8220;center&#8221; is more bourgeois than the
"right.&#8221; But on the contrary, the &#8220;right&#8221; is supposed to be more bourgeois
than the &#8220;center"; indeed in another part of the thesis, Trotsky says that
the &#8220;right&#8221; is a bridge from the &#8220;center&#8221; to counter revolution! This analysis
seems to the C.L.S. to be a confused one. We do not see any ultra-left
tendency internationally but we do see two right wing tendencies, each
with its different phrases and forms yet both right wing; and we also see
the International Left Opposition.
<center>
<p><b>Final Questions</b></center></p>

<p>Finally we raise another set of questions:
<p>If there is no party in the S.U., then why is it not the task of the
International Left Opposition to build one? If there is no party in the
S.U., is there a Comintern? And if there is no Comintern, must not we build
another one? Here again, Trotsky apparently does not draw the conclusions
from his premise. He still maintains his old stand that the opposition
fights as a fraction for the reform of the Comintern. This is also the
position of the C.L.S.
<p>We declare: (1) There is a Communist Party in the S.U., and there is
a Comintern. (2) Our job is to be a faction of this Comintern and C.P.
(3) However, we can do our task only by independent action on the working
class and mass work. This is the only way to correct the party.

<p><b>War In The Coal Fields&nbsp; </b>by Vera Buch</center></p>

<p>Striking by tens of thousands in five different states, the coal miners
have been once more in the vanguard of the struggles of the working class.
This time, it is a grim and bitter battle against starvation, with more
than three score people killed, including both miners and deputies, with
35 miners in Kentucky now facing death on a mass murder charge, with gassing
of women and children, brutal clubbing&#8217;s of picket lines, and terror in
a hundred hidden nerve-wracking ways, lying in ambush throughout the strike
fields.
<p>The coal strikes show on a reduced scale the forces now at work within
the American Labor movement as a whole: mass workers resistance against
the effects of the crisis, the A.F. of L. in a strike breaking role of
fake settlements, the Conference for Progressive Labor Action active in
shunting the rank and file resistance into ineffective channels, the National
Miners Union revived and leading masses but seriously handicapped by the
accumulation of its errors past and present.
<center>
<p><b>25,000 Miners Strike</b></center></p>

<p>In Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, and the panhandle section of
West Virginia, some 25,000 miners have been on strike under the leadership
of the N.M.U. This strike at the time of writing has come to a halt, but
it is possible that with correct tactics it may be revived and extended.
The Communist Party&#8217;s confession of errors (published in the Daily Worker
of Aug. 3.) brings to light a whole list of serious blunders which however
it fails to trace to their source. Nor are the chief shortcomings touched
upon. The complete lack of a worked-out strategy for this strike would
make success difficult even were there present proper preparation for the
strike (as there was not), even were there functioning nuclei of the party
(as there was not), even were there prompt mobilization for relief and
defense work (as there was not), even were there correction of all the
many errors mentioned in the Daily Worker. What was necessary was the mapping
out of the mines of the most important soft coal companies, the Carnegie
Co., the Pittsburgh Terminal Co., the Frick Co., etc., and systematic concentrating
upon these mines with a view to developing pit committees and of pulling
the mines out on strike. Instead, the union and party leaders trailed the
movement of the workers and forces were spent in running after little strikes
in unimportant mines, striking little companies which will soon be out
of business anyway. The hunger marches which the Daily Worker boosted as
such a mighty achievement were in reality one of the prime means of breaking
the strike. At a critical moment, when there was every need of extending
the strike through picket lines to strategic mines, hundreds of men, women
and children were dragged miles over hot roads wearing out energy in a
futile, meaningless show&#8230;.. for what reason?&#8212;to convince them that
the government will not relieve their hunger&#8212;which fact their empty
stomachs had taught them many months before.
<center>
<p><b>Adopt &#8220;Rolling Wave&#8221;</b></center></p>

<p>Now, tardily, a &#8220;new&#8221; strategy is outlined (see Daily Worker of Aug.
15<sup>th</sup>) which is none other than the &#8220;Rolling Wave&#8221; first brought
forward in 1929, in Gastonia, by Comrade Albert Weisbord. The essence of
this strategy is that where the workers forces are weak and unorganized,
in trustified, widespread industries where means are lacking for concerted,
general strike action, it is necessary to strike in layers, so to speak,
spreading from one mine or mill to another, not simultaneously but a section
at a time, with strikes renewed after a time in old sections where the
strikers became tired and went back to work but were still loyal to the
union. In 1929 this policy was turned down with hoots and sneers by the
Foster&#8217;s and Bill Dunne&#8217;s (and in its place, in the southern textile work
they proposed a plan for a general strike of 300,000 workers (on paper)
with, in actual fact, no strike action whatever, even with workers told
to go back to work who came to the union for leadership in strike, with
the result that the textile work in the south was completely killed. Whether
the &#8220;rolling wave&#8221; of strikes will succeed in the coal fields depends upon
the persistence of effort which the N.M.U. puts into it, as well as upon
the correction of the errors mentioned above. But the chief error, and
source of all other errors, never of course mentioned by the Daily Worker,
is the keeping in leadership in the Communist Party of officials (the Foster&#8217;s,
the Bedacht&#8217;s, the Browder&#8217;s, the Minor&#8217;s) who lay down the course the
workers must follow in strikes, but who themselves since they were Communists
never took part in a struggle of any sort, who toady to Moscow in order
to keep their jobs and are totally unfit to lead the workers in any struggle
little or big. So long as these leaders remain, all strikes led by the
Communists must be followed by &#8220;confessions of errors"&#8212;and the errors
must always be the same (see Party statements on the Lawrence strike, Eagle
pencil Co. Strike, etc.)
<center>
<p><b>Harlan Workers Militant</b></center></p>

<p>The Harlan County, Kentucky strike continues in a state of siege with
attention chiefly focused on the mass murder trial of 35 miners now going
on. Starting spontaneously as a mass movement against starvation, the Kentucky
strike has seen first the organization of a local union, the entrance of
the A.F. of L. for the benefit of the coal companies, now the N.M.U. organizers
winning some influence and the I.W.W. likewise active to a certain extent.
The claims of The Industrial Worker and of Industrial Solidarity that the
whole Kentucky strike field is solid for the I.W.W. are entirely unfounded
and illustrate only the methods of the leaders of that organization of
keeping their hold upon the organization by fraud and deceit.
<p>In West Virginia, Kanawha fields, the strike of several thousands of
miners continues under the influence of the Muste group, with a local organization
formed, the W. Virginia Mine Workers Union. This strike is not in a decisive
section and must encounter insuperable obstacles unless Logan County and
Southern W. Va. are also struck.
<p>Looking over the complicated situation, we are struck first by the division
of the workers forces. Three main influences are at work: (1) the A.F.
of L. (United Mine Workers) in a state of disintegration, still maintains
some hold upon the miners of the Anthracite and Illinois, with remnants
of influence elsewhere. The decadence of the U.M.W. is testified to by
the Rank and File Miners Movement of Illinois (under the influence of Hapgood,
Howat, Ameringer, etc.) Which declares itself alike opposed to the Lewis
machine and to the N.M.U. In Northern W. Va. the operators pay the men
if they join the U.M.W. (2) The Progressive forces, including the above
Illinois movement and the W. Virginia organization. The St. Louis convention
held a few months ago, failed either to unite the progressive forces or
to split away the Illinois group entirely from the AFL notwithstanding
much rank and file sentiment for a new union. (3) The National Miners Union
is a factor only in the Penn.-Ohio region. Thanks to the false polices
of 1929-1930, when the &#8220;third period&#8221; fever was rampant in the C.P. the
progressive miners were driven away from the N.M.U.
<center>
<p><b>Party Ordered Split</b></center></p>

<p>In the Anthracite, where there was no N.M.U., instead of building left
wing groups in the U.M.W., the party ordered its members to split and to
join the N.M.U. (thus driving some to Lovestone). In Illinois, the boycott
of the progressive convention of last year, the denunciation of the &#8220;social-fascists&#8221; (see Bill Dunne&#8217;s articles in the Daily Worker), combined with the miserable
failure of the strike led by the party, killed completely the influence
of the N.M.U. in this territory.
<p>The need of the hour is united struggle. Certainly it is useless to
tell the miners in Illinois or the Anthracite simply to join the N.M.U.
It is necessary to form united front committees of action taking in the
active, rebellious miners of all shades of opinion, with the program of
militant struggle upon which the N.M.U. was founded. Notwithstanding all
errors, the N.M.U. is the only organization in which there is any hope
of initiating such a move for unity.
<p>A word is necessary as to political roles in the miners struggle. With
the C.P. we have sufficiently dealt. The Socialist Party has made some
efforts to collect relief, which it gives to the Kanawha field and to the
A.F. of L. The Lovestone group has played a contemptible role, sneering
at the Penn.-Ohio strike, failing to see behind the party&#8217;s errors a genuine
mass movement of workers.
<p>The Communist League of Struggle in the first issue of the Class Struggle
correctly analyzed the miners situation. We are for struggle to the death
against the Lewis machine, for unity in action of all fighting miners behind
a militant program, with the N.M.U. taking the lead, for an amalgamation
of all the miners organizations outside the U.M.W. on the basis of such
a fighting program, for correction of the errors of the N.M.U., for all
possible support to miners now on strike, and for a broad, united mass
defense of the 35 frame-up Kentucky miners.
<center>
<p>***********************************</p>
<p><b>Cannon&#8212;ILD Aid Morgenstern&#8212;Goodman Conviction</b></center></p>

<p>By his policy of refusing in time to call for a united front for the
defense of Bernard Morgenstern and Leon Goodman, members of the Cannon
group who were convicted under the Flynn sedition act in Philadelphia on
June 24, Cannon gave aid and comfort to the prosecution. After the International
Labor Defense refused to handle the defense of the two workers because
they are &#8220;Trotskyists,&#8221; Cannon, Shachtman, and Co. In line with their usual
sectarian policy refused to call a united front conference for the defense
of the two militants.
<p>Both the Cannon group leadership and the Stalinized I.L.D. must be sharply
condemned for their action. The I.L.D. refusing to conduct the defense,
showed that it is only an organ for the defense of those who accept Stalin&#8217;s
national socialist program.
<p>As soon as the Cannons and Shachtmans saw that the I.L.D. would not
defend Morgenstern and Goodman, it was their duty to call a conference
of working class organizations to take up the case. The conference should
have fought the case in court on a working class basis, also aroused mass
sentiment for the defense of the two workers. If the I.L.D. will not defend
militant workers, they must be defended in spite of the I.L.D. If the I.L.D.
continues its policy, then the opposition groups and their sympathizers
must consider the advisability of the formation of a new labor defense
organization that will defend all workers arrested for participation in
the working class struggle.
<p>The members and sympathizers of the Cannon group must sharply condemn
the shameful role of their &#8220;leadership&#8221; in the Morgenstern-Goodman case.
By waiting until after the conviction to organize a defense committee the
Cannons and Shachtmans played into the hands of the enemy. Conferences
must be held in New York, Chicago and other places. Let us save Morgenstern
and Goodman from long prison terms! ---P.

<p><b>International Notes</b></center></p>

<p>Of paramount importance are the revolutionary situations in Spain and
in Germany.
<p>In Spain the revolution is still progressing, still moving forward.
The King has fled; the constitutional royalists do not dare to appear openly;
the clericals are on the run; a Radical Socialist coalition composes the
government; the great mass of poor are moving to the Socialists politically
and to the syndicalists in the trade union field; the left wing in the
Socialist Party is growing stronger; wide, deep, strikes are showing the
might of the masses.
<p>The Radical Socialist coalition can not solve the basic questions of
the revolution; not the ararian question, not the national question, not
the religious question, not the question of improved conditions for the
masses. Today the masses still have enormous illusions concerning the &#8220;revolutionary
government&#8221; of the Radicals and the Socialists. Tomorrow the masses must
become disillusioned. King Capital will remain; landlordism and chauvinism
will still be as dominant as ever. The masses then must take to the streets.
Spain will yet see and in the very near future, bitter, bloody street fighting.
<p>The great danger is that there is no Communist Party in Spain. This
means that there are possible sporadic outbursts, blind revolts, blundering
fights, but no organization no leadership, no theory. And without these
the proletariat must go down to defeat.
<center>
<p>* * *</center></p>

<p>Says Comrade Trotsky: &#8220;For a successful solution of all these tasks
three conditions are required: a party, once more a party, again a party.&#8221; <p>&#8220;How will the relationship between the various existing Communist organizations
and groups be arranged, and what will be their fate in the future? It is
difficult to judge from afar. Experience will show. Great events unmistakably
put to the test ideas, organizations, and people. Should the leadership
of the Comintern appear incapable of offering anything to the Spanish workers
except a wrong policy, apparatus commands and splits, then the genuine
Communist Party of Spain will be constituted and tempered outside of the
official work of the Communist International. One way or another&#8212;a
party must be created. It must be united and centralized.&#8221; <p>Following along these lines the International Left Opposition made proposals
for unity to the official Communist Party of Spain, but of no avail. Stalin
would rather lose the Spanish Revolution then unite with the Communists
in the International Left Opposition in a common fight against the common
enemy. This is the rudeness and disloyalty of Stalin of which Lenin speaks
in his testament calling for the removal of Stalin.
<p>What if the Communists demoralized by Stalin do not live up to their
mission and the masses do not find authoritative leadership? Then says
Trotsky: &#8220;The awakened hopes would very quickly be converted into disappointment
and exasperation. A condition would be created in Spain reproducing to
a certain measure the situation in Italy after the autumn of 1920. If the
dictatorship of Primo de Rivera was not fascist but a typical Spanish dictatorship
of a military clique supporting itself on certain parts of the wealthy
classes, then with the conditions pointed out above&#8212;the passivity and
hesitancy of the revolutionary party and the spontaneity of the movement
of the masses&#8212;genuine fascism would find a base in Spain. The big bourgeoisie
would conquer the unbalanced disappointed and despairing petty bourgeois
masses and would direct their revolt against the proletariat. Of course
we are far from that point yet. But no time should be lost.&#8221; <p>In our theses we have stated, &#8220;Nor is every reactionary movement fascism.
Fascism is not royalism, though royalists may be fascists&#8230;.&#8221; An interesting
question arises whether the reactionary movement supposed by Comrade Trotsky
will be royalist or fascist (either of the royalist or non-royalist type).
In our opinion this will depend upon the relationship of forces and the
intensity of the revolutionary movement and the nearness of its success,
and upon the international situation.

<p><b>Situation In Germany</b></center></p>

<p>For weeks the press has been speaking of the economic collapse of Germany.
This impending collapse was brought forcibly to the worlds attention by
Hoover&#8217;s moratorium plan. Only a short time before, on May 5<sup>th</sup>,
Mellon had declared in a speech that everything was in sound condition
in Europe. Now that the crisis is clear to all, and even Hoover&#8217;s moratorium
can not save the situation and panic is raging in Germany, Hoover tells
us that the acute financial crisis in Germany, a result of the excessive
withdrawals of capital, shows a lack of confidence which, however, is not
justified by the economic and budgetary situation of the country. Nevertheless
Hoover and the American bankers continue to share this lack of confidence
for they refuse to extend the short term credits of $100,000,000 to long
term ones.
<p>The seriousness of the financial panic in Germany cannot be denied.
The rate of interest rises in one day 2% to 5% to 7%. First class loans
bring 9% to 11%. The discount rate rapidly jumps to 15%. A steady drain
of gold from Germany to the extent of $10-$15,000,000 a day, a tremendous
of the exchange value of the mark, the deep plunge of the gold reserve
of the Reichsbank to the minimum necessary to cover the currency notes,
all are straws to show how the winds are blowing. The increasing number
of bankruptcies are now reaching for the largest concerns of all in Germany.
The biggest textile company&#8212;Wolkkammerei with a loss of 200,000,000
reichsmarks. There fails also, the Damstadter Bank, one of the greatest
capitalist institutions in Germany. The Reichsbank itself is on the verge
of bankruptcy. The $150,000,000 short term credit rushed to Germany is
being rapidly drained. Private hoarding has begun.
<p>The German crisis is having a tremendous effect on all the countries
of the world. It compels the United States to demand a moratorium on reparations
and war debts. The U.S. takes the lead first, because it can stand the
moratorium best; second, because the postponement of reparations means
that Germany can pay the interest on her private loans&#8212;mostly owed
to U.S. bankers and amounting perhaps to $250,000,000 or so; third, because
it is to the interest of the United States to maintain Germany as an ally
against Great Britain and as a key state against Bolshevik Russia. In the
moratorium the United States enters world affairs as the greatest world
power with decisive weight.
<center>
<p>* * *</center></p>

<p>The moratorium plan of Hoover dramatically exposes the insoluble contradictions
within the capitalist camp. &#8220;Defeated&#8221; Germany has to be &#8220;saved"; the &#8220;victorious&#8221; allies spring at each others throats. Due to the French opposition to Hoover&#8217;s
plan, the moratorium is but for one year, the payments with interest to
start in 1933 and to be paid in 10 years, the money to be used for economic
purposes only, all the terms of the Young Plan of slavery to be preserved,
railroad bonds of Germany to be held to be held by the allies, the question
of deliveries in kind to be deferred, and the allies of France (Poland,
Yugoslavia, etc.) Not to be hurt by the moratorium, the Austo-German Anschluss
to be killed. All this means that Germany gets very little relief. Indeed
by the transference of railroad bonds, Germany gets still deeper into debt.
The problem of the inability of Germany ever to pay the reparations still
remains unsolved.
<p>The second effect internationally of the German crisis is to deepen
still further the world crisis. For a time the central banks of Austria,
Hungary, Latvia, Poland, and Danzig have to close their doors. As Germany
goes so will all Mittel Europa.
<p>Lack of confidence in Germany means, with little exception, lack of
confidence in Europe and at once a drain of gold occurs in England, reaching
on July 24<sup>th</sup>, the unprecedented amount of $25,000,000, daily.
The bank rate is feverously raised from 2&frac12; % to 3&frac12; % to 4&frac12;
% but to no avail. The crisis deepens throughout the world. &#8220;Stabilization
is cracking, a world revolutionary crisis is in the making.
<p>The effect of this new panic on the toiling masses, coming as it does
on the shoulders of a two year old gigantic economic crisis has been truly
terrific. In Germany for a time unemployment insurance stopped, wages were
not paid, a run began on some of the savings banks. Soon inflation will
begin and the misery of the masses will be extraordinarily accentuated.
Whatever relief has been given the German capitalists has been at the price
of a new attack against the Communists. Since the moratorium a new and
particularly sharp drive has been launched against the Communists in Germany.
Party centers have been closed, the leading Communist paper suspended,
many Communists killed in the streets, etc. Every effort will now be made
to drive the Communist Party of Germany underground and to move against
the Soviet Union.
<center>
<p>* * *</center></p>

<p>Germany today stands at a great historical turning point. Before the
German ruling class stands the alternative: either imperialist power or
a colony. Before the German masses stands the alternative: either Fascism
or Communism. Like Samson of old, the German bourgeois stand ready to pull
down the pillars of all capitalism before they will submit to a colonial
status.
<p>The German ruling class has not as yet paid a cent of reparations with
its own money, it has built a more mighty economic machine than it ever
had before, it has regained its population: the Ruhr has been liberated,
an Austro-German alliance cemented; a new German navy is arising. Now is
the time to strike down the hated Versailles treaty, according to the German
capitalists. For now Bolshevism menaces; now the crisis has weakened the
capitalist states and divided them. The Fascist movement is the very embodiment
of these desperate imperialist hopes. The fascist movement is growing and
is even aided by the government. The German bourgeoisie is willing to pay
for its liberation by the slaughter of the Communists if a bargain can
be made.
<p>But the French capitalists cannot bargain. The French bourgeoisie can
not tolerate a new German imperialism even stronger than before. The day
Fascism wins Germany, that day sees the mobilization of the French troops
on the Rhine. Communism, the French ruling class can handle through its
economic might and military troops, through its Poland&#8217;s Czecho-Slavakia&#8217;s,
Yugo-Slavia&#8217;s, and Roumania&#8217;s. The analysis of Lovestone who sees with
the victory of Fascism in Germany only a united front against the Soviet
Union, and does not see the inevitable conflicts among the capitalist rulers
themselves, must be repudiated as completely false.
<p>The actual colonization of Germany is creating a revolutionary situation.
The strength of Communism increases. Should Fascism take power it will
be (not as in Italy or as may be in Spain) AFTER the proletariat has been
wearied and weakened, but while the workers are still fresh and have great
reserve power. The only danger is lack of a genuine Leninist Communist
Party. The theory of socialism in one country, the degenerate internal
regime, the theory of a &#8220;Peoples revolution&#8221; and that fascism is on the
decline, spell disaster for the Communist Party. The workers must make
every effort to build a sound International Left Opposition section in
Germany that will be able to correct these errors.

Group,

<p>(concluded from last issue)
<p><b>IV International Views of the C.P.L.A.</b></center></p>

<p>From the war program of the Conference for Progressive Labor Action,
we turn now to the international views of that organization as published
in its official organ Labor Age.
<p>1. Russia. Up to very recently never once does the C.P.L.A. or the Labor
Age call for the unconditional defense of the Soviet Union. Quite the contrary,
the Labor Age boosted the enemies of the Soviet Union and derided the fears
of the working class that the capitalists meant to attack Russia. Says
Pat Quinlan in his standing column &#8220;In Other Lands": (Feb. 1931, Labor
Age) &#8220;There may be substantial reasons for Russians thinking that the world
is arming against them, but we who are on the outside think these fears
are groundless.&#8221; <p>This is the way the C.P.L.A. &#8220;defends&#8221; Russia. May our enemies have
such &#8220;defense". At this very moment it was being exposed in Moscow that
the &#8220;Socialist&#8221; Quinlans themselves were aiding intervention in Russia.
<p>The C.P.L.A. did call for recognition of the Soviets by the U.S. government,
but for what reason? Here is the official statement on Russia by the December
Eastern Regional Conference (Labor Age, Jan. 1931) &#8220;WE call for recognition
of Soviet Russia by the U.S. as sound business policy in this era of depression.&#8221; The C.P.L.A. you see are good business men!
<p>2. If you are sick of the way Russia is treated, let us give you the
views of these great &#8220;Internationalists&#8221; on Great Britain. In the Feb.
1931 issue of Labor Age, Quinlan &#8220;socialist&#8221; and &#8220;international expert&#8221; for the C.P.L.A. summarizes the work of the British Labor Party government.
He declares: &#8220;The British Labor Party government was brilliant bold and
courageous on foreign affairs.&#8221; No more, no less. And what is the evidence?
<p>(a) The British Labor Party government kept the Empire together! This
is great &#8220;progress&#8221; indeed. Let the Irish masses, the colonial slaves Great
Britain rejoice. The Empire has been kept together! (b) Secondly, says
Quinlan, Egypt has been &#8220;soothed"! The British troops under the imperialist
British Labor Party have murdered thousands of toilers in Egypt. Massacres
have occurred again and again. All militant labor unions or peasant organizations
are stamped out. The iron heel of the British imperialists has ground into
the very flesh and blood of the Egyptians. But to the Labor Age&#8212;Egypt
is &#8220;soothed.&#8221; <p>(c) Thirdly, according to Quinlan, a working basis has been established
with the dominions. In the first place, this is NOT so, witness the breakdown
of the recent Imperial Conference with the Dominions in London. Secondly,
all that was attempted was a business deal between the British capitalists
and the capitalists in the Dominions. Facing war with the U.S., Britain
is feverishly striving to avoid the break-up of its Empire, so as to fight
more effectively. But can the Labor Age point out one way in which the
workers of the Dominions were aided by Britain?
<center>
<p>* * *</center></p>

<p>(d) Fourthly, says Quinlan, central Africa was &#8220;consolidated&#8221; under
the regime of the British Labor Party government. And this is hailed by
him as a great achievement. Every worker knows that this &#8220;consolidation&#8221; was part of the effort of the British Labor Partry to cheapen the cost
of enslaving the Negroes and to render their slavery more certain. What
an achievement for &#8220;Labor"!
<p>(e) Quinlan gives a fifth bit of evidence of this &#8220;brilliant, bold,
and courageous policy&#8221; of the British Labor Party government on foreign
affairs. It is the &#8220;great diplomatic triumph in Mesopotamia.&#8221; Lest the
reader not know of this &#8220;triumph&#8221; we wish to remind him that in Mesopotamia
there are rich oil fields. France wanted ti seize control through a monopoly
of the pipe lines. The British Labor Party, always a watchdog of the British
capitalists, made the French back down and share the plunder with the British
oil magnates. This is the &#8220;triumph&#8221; of labor. It is based on the slaughter
of the Mesopotamian masses.
<p>(f) According to the C.P.L.A. MacDonald did not jail and shoot the Indian
masses. This is but Communist propaganda against the Muste&#8217;s of England!
The Labor Age (Feb. 1931) in an editorial examines MacDonald&#8217;s policy in
India and finds it good. This editorial congratulates MacDonald on the
results of his India-London Conference. It also praises Gandhi, for it
is due to Gandhi that such a &#8220;substantial&#8221; move forward was made. The editorial
also congratulates MacDonald, Gandhi, and anyone else involved that &#8220;the
disturbance in India did not assume such serious proportions while the
Round Table was meeting so as to destroy its effectiveness completely.&#8221; And Quinlan tops this off with the statement in his column that the British
Labor Party government has &#8220;almost solved&#8221; the Indian problem! (By the
way, this is the same Pat Quinlan whom Bill Dunne placed on the Daily Worker
staff in 1927 as an &#8220;expert&#8221; on the labor movement).
<p>These are the unspeakable international views of the C.P.L.A. How any
worker, not an out and out imperialist, can accept these views is wholly
incomprehensible. These are not the views of class-conscious men, nor even
of &#8220;progressives". they are the views of Labors enemies.
<center>
<p><b>V. The Grand Program of the C.P.L.A.</b></center></p>

<p>When the C.P.L.A. was first originated in 1929 &#8220;Action&#8221; was far from
the minds of Muste and Co. What was needed, said they, was &#8220;education".
"Go to Brookwood, get educated.&#8221; This was the road to freedom. In an official
C.P.L.A. statement (Labor Age, August 1929) it was declared:
<p>&#8220;The fundamental purpose of the C.P.L.A. is an educational one, education
for action.&#8221; thus from the very beginning the workers were to get not action
but &#8220;education". If the &#8220;education&#8221; was through action it would not be
so bad. But here Brookwood education is counterposed against action. Action
is choked by Brookwood &#8220;education". Let us look at this &#8220;education".
<p>1. Muste writes an article (Nov. 1929, Labor Age) entitled &#8220;After Toronto
What?&#8221; dealing with the needle trades. The officials of the needle trade
union were gloating over the elimination of the Communists from the union.
The Communists are &#8220;destructive&#8221; (want to fight the boss). The A.F. of
L. is &#8220;constructive&#8221; (wants to have peace with the boss). Muste says: &#8220;It
is perhaps hardly necessary to repeat that we fully realize that organized
workers cannot take a negative or destructive attitude toward the operation
of the industries upon which they depend for a living.&#8221; Now we see Brookwood
education! It is &#8220;constructive". i.e. looks after the business of the boss.
<p>2. In December 1929, Budenz writes in Labor Age on the Green-Hoover
Pact in which Green agrees to have no strikes and to make no wage demands.
<p>&#8220;This is much the same as a love-lorn young man promising forever to
give up the girl of his dreams. It may be a noble gesture. But it scarcely
helps the promisors. Notice Budenz&#8217;s &#8220;education": Green is not a traitor
to the workers, he is but a &#8220;love-lorn young man.&#8221; His treachery is a &#8220;noble
gesture.&#8221; <p>3. With the growing crisis in 1930, Labor Age &#8220;education&#8221; became more
frightened. &#8220;Action&#8221; was beginning actually to be seen. The March 6<sup>th</sup>
demonstration of the unemployed showed the temper of the workers. Budenz
(May 1930, Labor Age) tries to head off the revolution with an article
"We Head for Revolution&#8221; Says Budenz: In 25 years we shall have a revolution
(thanks). Even now there is growing unrest. Russia will cause more unemployment
(This is good &#8220;education&#8221; a la Fish Committee) and since war will be an
alternative we must prepare for it by using Gandhi&#8217;s non-resistance method
plus an increase in international &#8220;thought". Here again we see the Labor
Age &#8220;education". It is education against Action.
<center>
<p>* * *</center></p>

<p>4. But let us finally hear Muste himself (Feb. 1931, Labor Age) in an
article, &#8220;The Labor Outlook": &#8220;I do not believe that this condition (unemployment
crisis) has as yet produced any great amount of bitterness or a desire
to revolt. I do not see any indication that the workers as a whole are
really for action on the trade union or political field.&#8221; <p>But do not be alarmed, dear reader, Muste goes further than this. He
is going to &#8220;prove&#8221; his point. Why is he an &#8220;educator&#8221; if not to &#8220;prove&#8221; the workers want no &#8220;action"? Here is his &#8220;proof":
<p>(a) Says Muste, prosperity came to an end recently. The crisis began
the middle of 1929. Muste is writing in February 1931, but for him it is
a very short time.
<p>(b) Secondly, Muste states, there was a big increase in wages 1920-1925
before the crisis. This is a downright lie. Only a Hoover apologist could
ever dream of stating this. Even Hoover&#8217;s Committee (See its report &#8220;Recent
Economic Changes in the U.S. 1929") declared real wages advanced 1923-1928
only 2% a year. Even this statement is false (See our theses May issue,
Class Struggle) but even if true, this is not a &#8220;big increase". And according
to Muste, the big increase began 1920 and not 1923. 1920 was a year of
great wage cuts as a matter of fact. And 1921-1922 was a year of crisis.
That is why Hoover&#8217;s prosperity report began with the year 1923. Yet Muste
thinks that there was a big increase in wages 1920-1925!
<p>(c) Thirdly, Muste says, the 1920-1921 depression was relatively mild
and short. Another Hoover lie. As a matter of fact, the depression was
so sharp a special committee was formed to investigate it. It was the deepest
crisis in the history of the U.S. up to that time. Over 5 &frac12; million
men were out of work. A mild crisis indeed!
<p>(d) The fourth reason why workers are not &#8220;active&#8221; today (Feb. 1931)
is that the workers today, according to Muste, are more illiterate and
ignorant than any previous generation of American workers. And this reactionary
twaddle is called &#8220;workers education".
<p>But let us give Muste&#8217;s great conclusion:
<p>&#8220;There is at the moment much more rebellion and much more eagerness
for a new political alignment among the intellectuals than there is in
the Labor movement.&#8221; There you have it. That&#8217;s progressive labor action
for you.
<center>
<p><b>VI The C.P.L.A.&#8217;s Unemployment Program</b></center></p>

<p>Space forbids us to deal with the Muste conception of the Labor Party
or his way of organization of the unorganized, or his queer ideas as to
the relationship between politics and economics. This would make a humorous
and delightful article in itself. However, we simply cannot leave the C.P.L.A.
without dealing with its unemployment program.
<p>In 1929 the greatest economic crisis in our history struck the U.S.
Here was a chance for &#8220;education". The C.P.L.A. called for an end to capitalist
anarchy. Repeating the New York Times, Muste (Jan. 1930 Labor Age) said
Hoover&#8217;s Big Business conference should have been called earlier before
the &#8220;damage&#8221; was done. If this conference had been called earlier, no doubt
the &#8220;damage&#8221; could have been prevented. (Thesis No. 1&#8212;Brookwood education).
<p>But Muste is a man of &#8220;action". He rushed to get together a &#8220;Research
Committee&#8221; composed of such bourgeois &#8220;economists&#8221; as Brissenden, Tugwell,
Mitchell, Chase, et al. Based on this &#8220;Research&#8221; the Conference for Progressive
Labor Action put out an official statement. (Feb. 1930 Labor Age) Do you
want to know how to eliminate such recessions as the present?&#8212;then
control the capital issues and loans of working capital. This is the fundamental
problem (Thesis No 2&#8212;Brookwood education)
<p>You see if you stop new capital issues, in this way you stop competition,
according to the new &#8220;economists&#8221; and if you stop competition, you stop
overproduction. Since we have overproduction now, if you don&#8217;t let any
more corporations to be formed, then presto&#8212;no more crisis. This little
shopkeeper, miserable petty-bourgeois phantasy is called &#8220;workers education&#8221; on unemployment.
<p>And the first place to stop competition, according to the C.P.L.A. is
in the &#8220;sick&#8221; industries, coal and textile. That&#8217;s the way to make them
well, don&#8217;t you know? The national government is to intervene to do it
too.
<p>Finally, the C.P.L.A. says the fundamental problem is better &#8220;dispribution&#8221; of the national income. (Thesis No. 3&#8212;Brookwood education) Nothing
about wiping out the Capitalist system, nothing about the exploitation
of the worker. The C.P.L.A. rushes to tell the capitalists how to put things
in &#8220;order&#8221; to eliminate competition, to give workers a little more to stave
off the revolution. This is the C.P.L.A. program. May we tell Lovestone
and Co. who find this program &#8220;acceptable&#8221; that it is the exact theory
of the Fascist Party in Italy?
<p>The C.P.L.A. was not content with this statement of the question. It
worked out some immediate demands. One of them called &#8220;short term measure&#8221; is for a census of the unemployed by the POLICE. (Editorial, Labor Age,
April 1930). Let the police take the names and addresses of all unemployed,
especially of the militant and Communist unemployed. It will do these unemployed
good. Maybe the unemployed will decrease in numbers thereby! Here the C.P.L.A.
becomes the very labor agents of the Fish Committee. Muddleheadedness is
here viciousness.

<p>But even this was not enough. The C.P.L.A. put out an official pamphlet
on unemployment (Mufson: &#8220;Why Unemployment Insurance?&#8221; see Labor Age, Feb.
1931). Why unemployment insurance? Let Mufson tell you: Because it is good
business to increase the buying power of the masses. But business is run
for profit and how business can be &#8220;good&#8221; under capitalism if workers are
paid more and thus profits are less, is a mystery only Henry Ford and Mufson
can explain.
<p>The C.P.L.A. drew up a &#8220;Bill&#8221; for social insurance. Shall workers out
of work get full wages? Oh, no. The C.P.L.A. is for 40% only of the wages
to be given the worker. Thus if you worked in a five and ten cent store
and got $15 a week, live on $6. It will keep you from being lazy. Should
workers draw this big pay while out of work? Oh, no. That also is too radical!
Only half a year can you draw this pay. If you are out of work a whole
year, you don&#8217;t have to follow Brookwood education, see? Should the unemployment
fund be administered by labor? Not for the C.P.L.A. They declare openly
their solidarity with Senator Wagner and Governor Roosevelt. That&#8217;s how
"progressive&#8221; the C.P.L.A. is, and in order to help Roosevelt become the
next president, the C.P.L.A. wants the unemployment fund administered by
the State Department of Labor supervised by two workers, two employers
(be fair, the employers too never work, they are also &#8220;unemployed"), and
one &#8220;public&#8221; representative, all to be chosen by the Governor.
<p>Good Governor Roosevelt, he will be fair! Good Tammany Hall, it will
pay unemployed workers! Not a cent will stick tk its fingers. Not a cent
will be used against the workers. Hurrah for the Deiocratic Party and the
C.P.L.A.!
<p>Of course, this unemployment pamphlet could not end without telling
the workers what to do. Do you want to get relief? Don&#8217;t have militant
street demonstrations. Do this: 1. circulate petitions. 2. write tour Congressman.
The renegade Bert Miller way, the C.P.L.A. way to salvation.
<p>Now we are at the end, dear reader. We have seen the Conference for
Progressive Labor Action is neither progressive, nor labor, nor for action
(except against the workers). In our theses (Class Struggle, May issue)
we have declared &#8220;The historic role (of the Muste group) is to serve as
decoy ducks to enable the A.F. of L. and the Socialist Party to continue
to mislead workers moving further and further to the lebt. The Communists
while free to unite with them on certain issues must sharply attack them
at all times.&#8221; <p>But what shall we say about the Lovestone group, that never really attacks
them, that far from exposing the treacherous role of the C.P*L.A., gives
a &#8220;left&#8221; cloak to them? The Revolutionary Age filled with criticism against
the Communist Party, has no criticism for Muste.
<p>We have gone into such lengths into the program of the C.P.L.A. not
because Muste must be exposed so much but because Lovestone must be exposed.
He is far more dangerous than Muste. If this article helps to liquidate
the Lovestone group, and to drive the Lovestones out of the Communist movement,
it will have accomplished its work.

<p><b>The Red Dreadnaught Is Launched</b></center></p>

<p>The first issue of the Navy Yard shop paper the Red Dreadnaught has
been successfully issued and its sister ship the second issue, is now &#8220;under
weigh". The Red Dreadnaught is the written expression of the first shop
nucleus under a Communist banner that has ever been formed in the Navy
Yard. Accurately aimed salvos directed at the Navy Yard bosses has resulted
in some correspondence from the workers in the &#8220;favored&#8221; industry. The
growing discontent of these &#8220;favored&#8221; workers is beginning to find articulation.
<p>Hoover&#8217;s economy begins of course with the workers wages and many despicable
tricks typical of the bosses are practiced. Laying off mechanics rated
as First Class and re-hiring them at Second or Third Class is a favorite
dodge. Safety appliances are inadequate and the burden and the burden of
blame in an accident is upon the worker injured. The worker who receives
a minor hurt will invariably nurse his wound until he can get relief from
an outside source, rather than go to the dispensary, as a couple of trips
to the dispensary will probably mean loss of job for the worker according
to a recent decision recently handed down from the Admiral. The Red Dreadnaught
carried the following demands drawn up by the Communist League of Struggle
shop nucleus; (1) Seven hour day. Five day week. (2) Unemployment insurance
for those laid off. To be paid by the employer. (3) More safety appliances.
(4) Payment for time it takes to muster. (5) If sent home due to weather,
no reductions from pay or vacations. (6) Better work clothes. (7) Against
fingerprinting and photographing of worker. (8) No firing at will by tha
employer. (9) Suspension charges before a workers committee. (10) Old age
pensions to be paid by the Navy Yard. (11) Recognition of the Union.
<p>The significant fact that this is the first Communist shop nucleus to
be formed in the Brooklyn Navy Yard is but reflection of the attitude of
the other Communist groupings. On the one hand, the failure of the official
Party and on the other, the refusal of the Cannon-Shachtman sect to participate
in mass work.

<p><b>Y. C. L. Convention</b></center></p>

<p>The position of the Communist League of Struggle was presented to the
recent sixth national convention of the Young Communist League in a statement
signed by Allen Abbott, George Lawson and Henry Rowley, three young workers
expelled from the Y.C.L. for supporting the program of the C.L.S. Mimeographed
copies of the statements were distributed at the convention hall and created
quite an impression on the delegates and other Y.C.L. members present.
<p>The statements concluded:
<p>&#8220;Our leaders must first stand the test as acting as Communists in mass
struggle before attaining leadership. We must fight for the carrying out
of Lenin&#8217;s program which he laid down in the program and theses of the
C.I.&#8217;s first four Congresses and which are contained in the program of
the Communist League of Struggle (adhering to the International Left Opposition).&#8221; <p>&#8220;Comrades, for these views we have been expelled from the Y.C.L. Join
us in our fight. Demand our reinstatement. Demand the reinstatement of
Comrade Trotsky and of the comrades of the Left Opposition to their rightful
posts. Demand the reinstatement of the members of the Communist League
of Struggle in the Party and the League.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Fight for the carrying out of Lenin&#8217;s testament.&#8221; <center>
