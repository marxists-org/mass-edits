<p><font size=+1>Communist League of Struggle</font>
<br />by Albert Weisbord</center></p>

<p>On March 15th 1931, the Communist League of Struggle was organized.
It arises out of the sternest necessity. There is no other way out for
the advanced class-conscious worker.
<p>Two facts stare us in the face. First the utter incapacity of the other
groups, with their false policies and practices, to lead the workers successfully
toward the proletarian revolution; second, the fact that we have not much
time to lose to begin to build a real Communist organization in the United
States.
<p>The Communist League of Struggle raises high again the red banner of
class struggle which has been dropped into the mire of opportunism so long.
We realize the great difficulties that face us. We come out at a time when
the greatest confusion reigns in the radical movement.
<p>It is precisely because of these difficulties that the Communist League
of Struggle is organized. We do not rely on subsidies from abroad or on
a petty-bourgeois clientele. Our sole reliance is on our internal strength,
on the knowledge that our correct line and actions must win the majority
of the working class to us as the Bolsheviks did in Russia.
<center>
<p>---&#8212;---</center></p>

<p>What are the principal differences between the other Communist groups
and us?
<p>First, we are an internationalist group through and through. We connect
in the most intimate, living, concrete way, the international perspectives
of struggle with our tasks in the United States. We adhere to the basic
principles of the International Left Opposition, lead by L.D. Trotsky.
<p>Second, we are thoroughly rooted in American life. We are a Marxist
group, understanding and utilizing the laws of motion that flow from the
internal contradictions and antagonisms springing from American Imperialism.
<p>Third, we alone connect theory and practice in a Leninist manner. Not
we are guilty of helping to betray or, of running away from strike struggles.
The members of the Communist League of Struggle by their record have shown
how to organize the unorganized, how to advance the cause of Communism
in the concrete everyday battles of the workers. Not an isolated sect,
but a two-fisted hard group of Communists is what we are forming.
<p>We alone raise the Leninist slogan <em>A vanguard party! No leadership
without Communist behavior in the dangerous concrete struggles of the masses!</em>
We must clean the Menshevik pus out of the Communist movement!
<p>The basis of a Communist movement must be confidence. By our deeds we
will create this confidence in the minds of the broadest masses.
<center>
<p>---&#8212;---</center></p>

<p>Of all the Communist groups, we alone are not a reconstituted faction
that poisoned the party for so many years. We aim to cut across the other
groups with the axe of Leninism, to drive a deep wedge between the right
wing opportunists and the revolutionists everywhere.
<p>We start as Marx started, with a <em>Communist League;</em> as Lenin started,
with a <em>League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class.</em>
Upon our shoulders lies the heaviest responsibilities. We can not shrink
from our duty. We shall pursue our course regardless of what others say
or do.

<p><font size=+1>MAY DAY, 1931</font></center></p>

<p>May Day 1931&#8212;A call to action for the Communists to take up the Banner
of Struggle for International Revolution.
<p>The capitalist world sinks ever deeper into the crisis. It heaps misery
upon misery upon backs of the toiling masses. For countless millions of
human beings life today is a torture house of hunger, unbearable toil and
black anxiety. In China, and India, in other colonial countries, revolution
presses forward. Everywhere the capitalist rulers look anxiously for remedies.
But they can find no way out of the blind alley. War looms as the only
solution they will choose.
<p>Amidst all the chaos and suffering the Soviet Union, the Workers&#8217; Republic,
stands firm and strong. No intrigues of Stalin, no blunders of the Communist
International have yet dimmed this hope of the workers of the world.
<p>For our new-born Communist organization, the way in America lies clear.
This country is drawn further and further into the whirlpool of the world
crisis. There is no separate course for us. Only the international Communist
revolution will give any permanent solution to the anxious problems of
the masses.
<center>
<p><b><em>Ten Million Now Jobless</em></b></center></p>

<p>Ten million unemployed suffer the pangs of hunger and cold. And in the
factories with new speed-ups and wages cut to the bone there is a hell
just as bad. On the farms, gaunt starvation stares the producers of food
in the face.
<p>The government runs from this relief measure to that but no real help
is forthcoming. The profits of the big corporations pile bigger than ever.
And to curb the discontent and restiveness of the masses, to crush the
rebellion that is brooding in the cities and in the country, anti-foreign
and anti-red measures are being carried out. The Fish Committee recommendations
will strike a heavy blow at the radical movement. Lynching, aiming to crush
the rebellious spirit of the Negroes is increasing to a terrible extent.
The latest legal lynching planned in Alabama of eight Negro youths is a
dastardly crime which the whole working class must rise to prevent.
<p>We are not fooled, either by the phrases of the Communist Party that
the whole working class is in a &#8220;revolutionary upsurge&#8221; or by the Lovestone
idea of the &#8220;docility&#8221; of the workers. The masses are not revolutionists
yet, but they will respond quickly to any real Communist leadership. That
they are not docile is proved overwhelmingly by the big wave of strikes
in recent months. The textile strikes of Danville, Va.; Philadelphia, Pa.;
Lawrence, Mass.; Shelton, Conn.; the longshoremen&#8217;s strike of New Orleans,
the strikes of the anthracite and West Virginia miners, all these are but
forerunners of bitter if short strike battles in which the workers will
strike back for some of the terrible worsening of their living conditions.
<p>The trade union movement is in chaos and disintegration. The Communist
movement is no better. The Trade Union United League has miserably fallen
down in its important tasks. But amidst this chaos the appearance of the
Communist League of Struggle with its clear cut theses comes as a fresh
message of hope.
<center>
<p><b><em>Must Not Forget Past Struggles</em></b></center></p>

<p>On May 1931 we raise the call to action. We base ourselves upon the
best traditions of the American working class. We do not forget that in
the eight hour day struggles of the workers of this country was the origin
of the first May Day as Labor Day. We do not forget the bitter workers&#8217;
struggles of the past in this country; we do not forget the Knights of
Labor, the Western Federation of Miners, the I.W.W. in its militant days.
We carry forward the traditions of Passaic, of New Bedford and Gastonia
in which battles we ourselves fought at the head of the workers. We are
armed with the science of Marx and Lenin, not with cablegrams from Moscow.
<p>For this coming May Day we call upon the American workers to take their
place in the ranks of the revolutionary workers. We join in a united front
with the Communist Parties demonstrating the world over. We call upon our
members and followers and upon workers everywhere to join in the demonstration
called by the Communist Party, to leave their machines, bring out the workers
from their shops, to come forth upon the streets in a mighty demonstration
against capitalist starvation and unemployment and for Communism.
<p>Men and women workers, young and old, Negro and white, join with us
in the struggle.
<p>Sharpen the struggle against the exploiters!
<p>Join the Communist League of Struggle!
<p>All power to the Working Class!
<p>-- Vera Buch

<p><font size=+1>NEW JOBLESS LINE FOR T.U.U.L.</font></center></p>

<p>At the meeting of the Trade Union Unity Council of New York held March
27, we were again greeted with an old story. Sam Nessin, head of the Unemployed
Council took the floor and in regular routine fashion criticized the work
done during the past year.
<p>&#8220;From now on we start on a new policy,&#8221; said Nessin. A review was made
of the past work. He said that a few mass demonstrations and open air as
well as indoor meetings held in the headquarters, somehow did not draw
the masses. The new policy, he continued, is to start at once on the plan
of organizing on a block basis. Concentration will take place in certain
residential quarters where the poorest workers live and a survey will be
made of all unemployed. In connection with this, tenant leagues will be
organized with the idea that those who are out of work shall not pay rent.
This will enable them much more easily to protect and put up real resistance
against evictions. They will also attempt to find out which families need
the aid of public charitable institutions and see to it that their needs
are fulfilled.
<p>All of the &#8220;new&#8221; plan, with the exception of the last idea was proposed
by Albert Weisbord several months ago, in an article which appeared in
the <em>Militant.</em>
<p>Nessin also proposed the opening up of kitchens in the blocks to feed
the hungry workers. This was not as yet finally adopted by the Unemployed
Council.
<p>As a delegate from the Office Workers Union, I acquainted them with
this five months ago. At that time it sounded somewhat off the beaten path
and every delegate that spoke after me, deliberately evaded it. They were
not under instructions to support it and since it did not emanate from
the top, they couldn&#8217;t use sufficient common sense to determine whether
it was right or wrong.

<p>Delegate, Office Workers Union

<br />&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>PARTY THUGS ATTACK THREE WORKERS</font></center></p>

<p>Lead by paid functionaries of the Communist Party, about 20 strong arm
men attacked three members of the Communist League of Struggle who were
giving out leaflets, Saturday, March 21 to workers who were entering New
Star Casino, 107th St. and Park Ave., to attend the bazaar arranged by
the Needle Trades Workers Industrial Union.
<p>The leader of the gang was Milton Weich, a paid Stalinist flunky. Those
attacked were Sylvan A. Pollack, managing editor of <em>Class Struggle;</em>
Harry Fisher, unemployed worker and Thomas Bunker, seaman.
<p>About 15 minutes after the three workers started to give out the leaflets
announcing the Friday night lectures of the C.L.S., the thugs arrived on
the scene. Fisher, who had given out leaflets many times in the past was
the first one attacked. Weich demanded that Fisher give him the leaflets.
When he refused the Stalinists got into action. The 3 workers defended
themselves the best they could but due to the overwhelming odds retreated
before the superior forces. Fisher&#8217;s right cheek was cut.
<p>Fisher was attacked by Party functionaries on two other occasions. When
he was giving out leaflets with Vera Buch, director of the school of the
C.L.S. near the district office of the Communist Party, Fanny Rudd, a paid
Party organizer incited a mob to attack the two militants. Fisher was also
attacked when giving out leaflets to workers on 14th Street.
<p>All proletarian members of the Communist Party and militant workers
generally should protest against this method of using terror against Communist
workers. These attacks against the C.L.S. will not prevent it from continuing
its activities in the working class struggle.

<p>******************************************************************</p>
<p><font size=+1>FIVE WORKERS FACE CHAIR IN PATERSON</font></center></p>

<p>Five militant members of the National Textile Workers Union are facing
the electric chair in Paterson, N.J. where they are being held in jail
without bail charged with killing a bootlegging silk boss named Max Urban.
The workers are Benjamin Leib, Lewis Bart, Helen Gershonowitz, Louis Harris
and Albert Katzenbook.
<p>The workers were arrested on Feb. 18, following an eight weeks strike
at the Urban mill where the workers demanded a pay increase of one half
cent a yard for weavers on the two day shifts and one cent a yard on the
night shift, also the 40 hour week for all workers. Previous to the strike,
wages had been cut 50 percent. The strikers were trying to win back a small
part of the cut.
<p>The arrests took place following a fight on the picket line in which
not only Urban participated, but many of his gangsters too. It is believed
by some that Urban was fatally wounded by his own henchmen due to differences
over bootlegging questions.
<p>The attempt to send the five workers to the electric chair must be resisted
by all militant workers. It shows that although the N.T.W.U. has been considerably
weakened by the sectarian line of the official Communist party and expulsions
of the unions&#8217; founders, yet the mill owners and their flunkies realize
its potential strength. As in Gastonia in 1929, the Paterson bosses arrest
the leaders of the union and hold them on murder charges.
<p>This proves that the right wing Lovestone group is wrong in its stand
that the N.T.W.U. is dead and the only hope lies in the Muste leadership
in the U.T.W. and Associated Silk Workers.
<p>The right of the workers to strike must be defended by the whole working
class, which must mobilize to smash the vicious frame-up. Not a small,
Party controlled campaign but a united front of all working class organizations
is needed at once.

<p><font size=+1>LEGAL LYNCH LAW FOR 8 NEGROES</font></center></p>

<p>In the town of Scottsboro, Ala. with a population of 2,500 people, eight
Negro youths ranging in age from 14 to 21 years are victims of the age
old system of lynching for an alleged attack on white womanhood. This time
the lynching act is not being perpetrated by mob violence, but by strictly
"legal&#8221; means.
<p>A special dispatch from Scottsboro to the <em>Norfolk Journal and Guide</em>
states: &#8220;The biggest holiday in years for the mountainous sections of Northern
Alabama took place here Monday (April 6) as nine Negroes faced trial for
an alleged attack upon two white girls.&#8221; <p>Nine Negro lads, according to the testimony given in the Jackson County
Court, were riding a freight train on which were several white lads and
two white girls, disguised as boys. The Negro boys are said to have overpowered
the white boys and thrown them off the train, and then attacked the girls.
<p>From the news story in the <em>New York Times,</em> it is stated that
the two girls appeared as state witnesses. No mention is made of the white
youths who rode on the same train. Nor was it told what was their conduct
toward these girls at the time of the alleged rape.
<p>The white boys it would seem, should have made valuable witnesses for
the state. We wonder why the state did not make the proper efforts to produce
them. If innocent themselves and playing the role of protectors of the
girls, it seems reasonable that they should gladly come forward to testify
against those Negroes who endangered their own lives by throwing them from
a train.
<p>Eight of the Negroes have been sentenced to the electric chair. The
state claims in answer to a protest from the International Defense that
it has acted justly and rightly. The governor of the state declares that
no matter how much protest is made against the electrocutions of these
condemned Negro youths, he will not interfere.
<p>The judge utters the customary legal twaddle in defense of bogus justice.
"They were given every opportunity to provide counsel for themselves,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I appointed able members of the Jackson County bar to represent
them. More than a thousand members of the Alabama National Guard have been
stationed here to protect them. I personally will welcome any investigation
on the trial.&#8221; <p>We would like to know how these inexperienced Negro boys without funds
were to provide themselves with proper legal counsel. The court in the
legal order of things went through the farce of appointing attorneys to
defend them. But is any one so naive as to believe that able members of
the bar at Jackson county would give them adequate defense? And is the
calling out of 1,000 members of the Alabama Guardsmen more than a grand
gesture?
<p>On the one hand it seems a sort of stage play to satisfy the &#8220;enlightened&#8221; public sentiment while on the other, it is a yielding to the cannibalistic
blood craze of the howling mob which makes merry over every conviction
and cruel death of hopeless victims.
<p>It is interesting to note that the counsels appointed to defend these
boys allowed all and each of them to deny his own guilt and at the same
time to accuse all the others, a pretty sure method of convicting all.
<center>
<p>* * *</center></p>

<p>The procedure in the case of the Negroes in Scottsboro is not new. Ever
since the civil war which purported to free the Negro slaves, it has been
the rule in the Southern courts that the word of a black person has not
been worth the effort in stating it, if pitted against that of a white
person. If a white man said that a certain black man did any specific thing,
nothing this side of Mars will induce the &#8220;gentlemen&#8221; of a Southern jury
to believe otherwise.
<p>In the &#8220;bible belt&#8221; of the South when a Negro is accused in court of
the rape of a white woman it is equivalent to conviction and becomes an
occasion for gala festivities.
<p>If the Negro is not turned over to the mob by the sheriff, then the
method known as &#8220;due process of law&#8221; is used in order to quiet the cry
of &#8220;injustice&#8221; by the liberal elements. Then the state uses its court for
the supposed fair trial. Thus the gullible are appeased and the same end
is reached.
<p>-- By A Negro Comrade&#8212;G.L.

<hr align="center&#8221; size="1&#8221; width="30%">The following telegram was sent
to Gov. Miller of Alabama:
<p>&#8220;Mass meeting of Communist League of Struggle New York City, denounces
legal lynching of eight Negro youths. This frame-up calculated to crush
the Negro masses must be smashed. We demand the death penalty for lynchings,
complete equality and national liberation for the Negroes.&#8221; <center>
<p>**************************************************************************</p>
<p><font size=+1>THE ST. LOUIS CONVENTION</font></center></p>

<p>As we go to press a convention called by the Illinois and West Virginia
miners organizations is scheduled to open in St. Louis to organize a new
miners union. Already a conference has been held in West Virginia and a
West Virginia Miners Union formed. This marks one of the most important
recent developments in the labor movement. The miners are openly rebelling
against the Lewis-American Federation of Labor officials and against any
one who joins with these officials. The agreement that Farrington and Fishwick
made with Lewis as to who should rob and betray the workers was the final
act that whipped the miners into action.
<p>Where is the Communist Party&#8217;s National Miners Union in all this movement?
Nowhere! It has practically collapsed. Under the brilliant treachery of
the past and present Communist misleaders everything was done to prevent
the N.M.U. from being formed and to kill it when formed. It was formed
a year too late, at a time of great demoralization. The first convention
was adjourned (by Stachel and Swabeck) just when most of the delegates
were coming out of jail and could at last attend it. They had been arrested
towards the beginning of the meet. The convention was adjourned so hastily
that not even a constitution or program of action or even a functioning
office was established. A Young Communist League member was put in charge
of the union. Later, to be sure that the National Miners Union would be
killed the name was suddenly changed Mine, Oil, and Smelter Workers Industrial
Union and then just as suddenly again called the N.M.U. The president was
driven out. The secretary was sent away. The organizers staff was repeatedly
changed. The whole work was dropped.
<p>The more criminal the Party leaders&#8217; actions, the wilder become their
"theories". They declared the United Mine Workers with a couple of hundred
thousand exploited miners as members was &#8220;outright Fascist". All those
who did not leave the U.M.W. even in the anthracite (where the N.M.U. really
did not exist) were expelled forthwith. The left wing in the Anthracite
was thus also annihilated. The recent Anthracite strike was carried on
completely outside the slightest influence of the Communist Party or National
Miners Union.
<p>The new union movement in Illinois and West Virginia, the anthracite
strike of 20,000 miners and the St. Louis Convention, is further evidence
of the growing move to the left on the part of the masses. The Illinois
movement is also new evidence of the decline of the A.F. of L.
<p>The great danger is that the Muste group of &#8220;Progressive&#8221; (Howat, Hapgood,
Ameringer et al.,) will be allowed to control the movement and thus to
shunt off the movement to harmless channels. These &#8220;Progressives&#8221; do not
wish really to fight the American Federation of Labor misleaders. For a
long time they helped Farrington and Fishwick betray the masses of Illinois
coal miners. Now, having been used by Fishwick enough, they have been kicked
out. And having been kicked out, they try to utilize the tremendous discontent
among the coal miners for themselves.
<p>What shall be our policy in this situation? First of all, the Communists
must form a militant left wing in the Illinois and West Virginia new union
movement. The left wing must draw up a fighting program for the industry
and most sharply attack the Muste misleaders and try to oust them. It is
not a question of attacking the past of these misleaders and ask them to
be good (Cannon group position) and then make deals with them. It is a
question of declaring relentless unceasing war on them, to drive them out
of all influence. The attack must be based on present crimes and their
present programs. The left wing at St. Louis must also fight for the program
of the N.M.U. and for joint action leading to amalgamation with the N.M.U.
<p>Second, the N.M.U. must send delegates to this convention, not to liquidate
the N.M.U. (as Lovestone and Cannon desire), but to propose a joint conference
later to discuss the question of amalgamation. The N.M.U. must present
a fighting program that must include a struggle against the Muste misleaders.
<p>Third, at the same time the N.M.U. delegation must categorically reject
the positively criminal policies of the Foster leadership. It must be made
clear to the workers in the St. Louis convention that the phrase-mongering
bureaucratic theories and practices of the N.M.U. are things of the past.
<p>Fourth, the N.M.U. and the Communists must everywhere organize a left
wing in the U.M.W. especially in the Anthracite so as to bring together
all militants in the industry.
<p>The Communist League of Struggle warns the miners in the N.M.U. of the
liquidation tendencies of the Cannon and Lovestone groups. We look upon
eventual amalgamation of the new unions as strengthening the new union
movement, they look upon amalgamation as a method of liquidating the red
unions.

<p><font size=+1>CURRENT COMMENT by SYLVAN A. POLLACK</font>
<p><b><em>THE CLASS STRUGGLE</em></b></center></p>

<p>In adopting the name <em>Class Struggle</em> for its official organ, the
Communist League of Struggle is following the best traditions of the Communist
movement of this country. In 1918 and 1919, a Marxist magazine was published
in the United States known as the <em>Class Struggle</em>. In its columns
were printed for the first time in English many of the writings of Lenin
and Trotsky. To a large extent it helped shape the development of the Communist
forces in this country. After the split from the Socialist Party and the
definite organization of the Communists as a separate movement it continued
publication as the theoretical organ of the Communist Labor Party, until
the Palmer Red raids of 1919 drove the movement underground.
<p>Twelve years after its suspension a new <em>Class Struggle</em> is born.
It will not be merely another newspaper but will strive to become a paper
for all of the toiling masses. It will connect the past struggles of the
American workers with what can be expected in the future. It will publish
articles built upon the iron foundations of Leninism and will try to avoid
all the opportunism and deviations from the Bolshevik principles found
so often in the columns of the <em>Daily worker, Revolutionary Age</em> and
the <em>Militant</em>.
<p>It is starting modestly as a monthly but with the support of the militant
working class will develop into a mighty weapon of the class struggle.
It is determined to continue publication under all and any circumstances,
including the driving of the Communist movement underground, the objective
of the Fish Committee.
<p>It will publish the writings of the Leninist leaders of the International
Communist movement, news and articles of the class struggle in America
and the rest of the world. It also hopes to develop a corps of workers&#8217;
correspondents who will write of conditions on the jobs, in the trade unions
and labor fraternal organizations, as well as express their own opinion
of problems and activities of our movement.

<p><em><font size=+1>UNITED FRONT AGAINST THE PARTY!</font></em></center></p>

<p><em>"Double-facedness and subterfuge are the characteristics of all opportunists.
Driven away from one position they always attempt to smuggle it in under
some other pretext. This is the case in the attempt to retreat under fire
from the idea of a political bloc with the Right Wing outlined in Weisbord&#8217;s
articles in the Militant to the proposal for a &#8216;United Front&#8217; on everyday
tactical questions. Can&#8217;t we at least get together with them in the trade
union?&#8217; they ask. No, not even in this limited sphere, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT
GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION WITH THEM. From the start, that is from the
day the Lovestoneites were expelled from the Party, we rejected all ideas
of a common front with them. And correctly so.&#8221; James P. Cannon, Dec. 23,
1930</em> (emphasis by Cannon).
<center>
<p># # #</center></p>

<p>During recent months Cannon, Schactman and the other spokesmen of the
Cannon group have been constantly denying that any work separate and distinct
from that lead by the official Party could be conducted by Communists outside
the Party. &#8220;To do so,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;would mean to make a united front against
the Party!&#8221; The writer of these lines was expelled from the Cannon controlled
organization on Mar. 17, 1931 because he dared take issue with the right
wing, sectarian line of Cannon.
<p>Cannon and Co. have stated on many occasions that only the activities
of the Party can be supported. If the Party refuses to do any work, then
all we can do is criticize its lack of action was their line of reasoning.
Which means, of course, to sit back comfortably in a swivel chair waiting
for the Browders, Fosters and Bedachts to lead the workers along the correct
path!
<p>Cannon has also been quite insistent against any joint activities with
the Lovestone group. Make a united front with the right wing against the
Party?! Not Cannon! He and his colleagues would only support the &#8220;center&#8221; (the Party) in fighting the Right wing, which is rapidly going towards
Social Democracy.
<p>Yet what do we find? The Friends of India&#8217;s Independence, whose main
sponsor is none other than Bert Miller (who is too much of a right winger
even for Lovestone), arranged a protest meeting against the execution of
three Indian Nationalists&#8212;- Bhagat Sinch, Raj Guru, and Sukh Dev, by
the British government. The scheduled speakers included Louis Budenz, Conference
for Progressive Labor Action; Ludwig Lore, N.Y. Volkszeitung; Carlo Tresca,
Il Martello; Roger Baldwin, American Civil Liberties Union; Bert Miller;
Bertram D. Wolfe of the Lovestone group and <em>James P. Cannon!</em>
<p>Here we find Cannon in a united front in which the Party is not a part
and which follows a line against the Party, including not only the Lovestone
group, but those far to the right of Lovestone (such as Budenz of the Muste
group; Miller, who is on the road to Muste; Lore, a left Social Democrat
and Baldwin, the liberal).
<p>Why the sudden change of policy, Comrade Cannon? Have you suddenly decided
that you could not continue your bluff any longer?
<p>Less than two weeks after the formation of the Communist League of Struggle,
we find an apparent change of policy on the part of Cannon. This is the
same Cannon who has criticized the officials of the Communist Party for
making a complete change of policy without any explanation either to the
membership or the workers as a whole.
<p>The same Cannon who in 1923 made an alliance with John Pepper to orientate
the Party forces toward the farmers and in 1925 made a bloc with Lovestone
against Trotsky and for Stalin and Bucharin.
<p>Cannon&#8217;s speaking at the &#8220;united front&#8221; meeting is merely a gesture
to cover his lack of real work in the class struggle. After the meeting
is ended he will again sit down and rest comfortably for about six months.
If any one asserts that his group is not doing any work, he will point
with pride to the meeting arranged by the Friends of India&#8217;s Independence.
This will be his &#8220;mass work&#8221; cloak to cover his omissions. However, it
will not fool the militant working class. Not mere gestures once or twice
a year but regular, sincere, activities are needed. The Communist League
of Struggle has been organized for that purpose.

<p>In the <em>Daily Worker</em> of March 13, we find a blurred photograph
on the front page showing Charles Coder, Trade Union Unity League organizer
and Lewis Hurst, Young Communist League organizer. It is accompanied by
an eight column streamer and a news story telling of their being flogged
into insensibility and then being thrown into a river and drowned in Dallas,
Texas.
<p>On page four of the same issue of the <em>Daily Worker</em> we find the
photograph of Carl Miller and a Central Control Commission statement announcing
his expulsion from the Party as an &#8220;unreliable dishonest element". It continues
by pointing out that Miller joined the Party last fall in Philadelphia,
also that he originally came from Texas. How later he was sent to Trenton,
N.J. as a representative of the International Labor Defense and of his
disappearance after getting hold of $75 of the organization&#8217;s funds.
<p><em>One &#8220;mere&#8221; detail that Harrison George and the rest of the Daily
Worker staff forget to mention in their news stories about the Dallas affair
is that the Charles Coder whom they praise as a working class hero on page
one, is the same Carl Miller whose expulsion as a common thief they announce
on page four.</em>
<p>Evidently Miller, or Coder as he is now named finding the pickings so
easy in the Philadelphia-Trenton district went back to his home state and
became converted to Communism for the second time within a year. The Fosters
and Stachels who run the Trade Union Unity League immediately appointed
him district organizer. Things, however, did not run so easy this time
for Miller-Coder. The capitalist authorities of Dallas did not know that
he was planning another financial coup like the one in Trenton and arrested
him, later beating him up with the Y.C.L. organizer, Hurst.
<p>Perhaps the next time Miller-Coder joins the party (under a different
name, of course) he will choose a less dangerous spot than the Lone Star
state and one where the financial returns are better.
<p>As for the proletarian members of the Communist Party and the left wing
workers who support it, what have they to say about such reckless, irresponsible
action on the part of the so-called leadership?

<p><font size=+1>THERMIDOR AND BONAPARTISM</font>
<br />by LEON TROTSKY</center></p>

<p>Concerning the question of Thermidor and of Bonapartism, I will only
speak very briefly, for I have already expressed myself several times on
the necessity of developing this theme in an article. The danger in this
question, as well as in every other <em>historic</em> question consists of
the fact that we are too apt to draw analogies too formally, no matter
how important and fruitful they may be, and that we are wont to reduce
the concrete process to abstractions. Thermidor was a transitory form between
Jacobinism and Bonapartism. What was really characteristic of the Thermidor
was the fact that the government was formally controlled by the members
of the same party. Part of the Jacobins, or quasi-Jacobins, destroyed the
other part, the true Jacobins, by an appeal to open civil war. Bonapartism
signifies the victory of the bureaucratic-military centralist power over
all the various <em>shades</em> of Jacobinism. In the language of the class
struggle, this means the gradual change of power from the sans culottes
to the leisure class.
<p>If we take into consideration theoretically the possibility of a counter-revolutionary
victory in the Soviet Union that does not mean that the latter must take
on the form of the French Thermidor. It may skip this stage directly to
Bonapartism, or intermingle the two, just as the October Revolution intermingled
the end of the democratic revolution with the beginning of the socialist
revolution. Such a mixture of historic stages corresponds perfectly to
the social development of Russia and to its entire history.
<p>What we must take into consideration above all is the immense role of
the Russian Party or rather, at present, of its apparatus. With us the
party is far more advanced than the State apparatus. For example, Rykov,
from the point of view of the party, has been entirely liquidated, but
still remains the head of the state. Thermidorian elements have materialized
in the life of the party: genuine &#8220;Jacobins&#8221; have been replaced by opportunists,
but Bonapartist elements have also developed largely, that is in the selection
of the apparatus according to a single commandant (Stalin). Weakening of
the character and of the spine is a very important preparatory work of
Bonapartism.
<p>The counter-revolution has not yet become victorious, the question is
not yet settled, and that is the reason for our implacable struggle against
the Korschists and the other howlers. One physician says: the man is sick,
there is hope of curing him; it is my duty to do all in my power to put
him on his feet again. Another says: no, he must die, and turns his back
on the patient. What can these two physicians have in common?
<p>But when the counter-revolution does come, will it take a Bonapartist,
a Thermidorian or a combined third form? It is impossible to say, but our
duty consists in observing attentively the existing elements of the possible
variants of counter-revolution and their dialectic development.
<p>Comrade Landau writes me that some comrades have expressed the opinion
that the proletariat is the weaker class in Russia. This question cannot
be solved nor even correctly posed in cross section. We must look at it
dynamically. Theoretically speaking, it is not impossible that a victorious
counter-revolution will prove that the Russian working class has become
so weakened that it is no longer able to hold the power in its own hands.
But that can only be done by open civil war. Politically we must prevent
this possibility by reinforcing the political and economic points of support
of the proletariat. There is no economic or political scale by means of
which we could daily weigh the relation of forces and in this manner decide
upon a &#8220;point quotation". The most important fact is that the bourgeoisie
is as yet far removed from victory, but that within the present regime
the germs of very important elements of its victory are growing.
<p>So much, for the present, on this question.

<p>For years the defeated German rulers have tried to unite Austria with
Germany. Now both countries have agreed to have the closest working union
possible. They have formed a common tariff wall and customs union. At once
a howl arises from the capitalists of other countries. Fists are shaken.
Sabres are drawn. War threats are hurled.
<p>The United States looks with favor on this Anschluss. America is trying
to work closely with Germany against Britain so as to attack Britain from
both the front and the rear. Besides, it helps secure the hundreds of millions
of dollars invested in Germany by Wall Street.
<p>The German-Austrian Anschluss intensifies all the contradictions of
world capitalism and leads us still closer to the next war.

<p>The King of Spain has &#8220;resigned&#8221; the throne. Spain is now a republic.
This is not a social revolution. It is a political revolution only. So
far as bettering the conditions of the masses is concerned, it means very
little. Yet the formation of a Spanish Republic should be a great opportunity
for the masses. The workers must break away from their treacherous leaders
-- the socialists and the anarcho-syndicalists&#8212;<em>and push the revolution
further.</em> Not a palace revolution, not a mere change of rulers, but
a real workers&#8217; republic must be formed. All objective conditions for a
real revolutionary crisis are present. Will the Communists live up to their
responsibility?
<p>Should the masses get active on their own behalf, we shall soon see
the &#8220;Republicans&#8221; rush into the arms of the Royalists and beg the King
to &#8220;restore order". The monarchist forces are still intact. They are waiting
for just this.

<p>Gandhi is going to London. India is better off without him. The Lovestone
group actually thought Gandhi &#8220;symbolized the revolution". In only shows
how Lovestone symbolizes Communism.
<p>Gandhi never demanded independence for India. He never raised any demands
for the masses. It is with great pleasure we read how this &#8220;symbol&#8221; is
being repudiated by the masses and his prestige broken. The trip by Gandhi
to London is a confession that he can no longer control the Indian masses,
that the masses intend to take things into their own hands and repudiate
both Gandhi and those Communists who think the Revolution is so low that
Gandhi is their &#8220;symbol".

<p>The peasant armies in China are making great headway. Says Sweetland,

an efficiency which have never been equaled by any other armed force in
China.&#8221; That is what the bourgeoisie thinks. More power to this guerrilla

<p>Sandino&#8217;s valiant army is fighting for Nicaraguan independence. As we
go to press, the <em>Daily Worker,</em> organ of the Communist Party, is
still strangely silent on this. Why? Shall we suggest that brave Latin-American
"expert&#8221; --Harrison George, squander a few more thousands of dollars of
the R.I.L.U.&#8217;s money (a few <em>more</em> won&#8217;t matter) and take a trip down
there to discover Nicaragua? We warn him, however, to keep away from the
Nicaraguan rebels.
<p>The Communists must work actively for the defeat of the American marines
in Nicaragua. Large-scale help must be given the Nicaraguan masses fighting
against American imperialism. The Communist League of Struggle raises the
cry: <em>A united front to drive out the marines from Nicaragua!</em>

<p>***********************************************************************</p>
<p><font size=+1>WHITHER THE MARINE WORKER?</font></center></p>

<p>The bitter cry of the marine worker from the abysmal depths of chaos
is mocked by a resounding echo. In the situation he finds himself today,
bewilderment and near panic has taken the place of his usual stoicism.
<p>On the waterfront of New York there are no less than seven labor organizations,
tugging at different points of the compass, to steer him along the &#8220;right&#8221; course. Meanwhile, aboard the ships, harbor craft and longshore, wages
are being slashed, hours lengthened and speed-up methods imposed. It is
little wonder that over 95% of the marine workers are unorganized. Think
of it, only 5% of this basic industry organized and this 5% we shall observe
are in unions that so far as economic activity is concerned amount to nil.
Prominent is the Marine Workers Industrial Union which began as a club
evolving to a league which finally under the guidance of the official Communist
Party gave birth to the union in its present form. Few marine workers&#8217;
organizations in recent years could boast of as fine a body of tried class
conscious workers as that which mustered under its banner. These workers
were for the most part experienced in class struggle organization from
ports ranging from the North Sea to Australia.
<center>
<p><b><em>Did Good Work in South America</em></b></center></p>

<p>The organization of the waterfront at Buenos Aires by some of these
very workers is still an epic in marine circles. But alas; &#8220;Papa&#8221; Losovsky
saddled upon the M.W.I.U. his protege, little &#8220;Papa&#8221; Mink. Now Little Mink
is a &#8220;tried in struggle&#8221; worker who knows the marine industry from A to
Izzard. He derived his experience for the most part by steering a taxi
a zig-zag course thru traffic crossing the intersections of Philadelphia&#8217;s
streets on a starboard light and listening to some old sailors talking.
The little &#8220;Papa&#8221; disclaims all knowledge of longshore work of course Mink
with Hynes&#8212;his man Friday-and Harvey&#8212;his &#8220;yes&#8221; man have a dirty record
of bungling and criminal neglect among the workers. The misleadership of
the first New Orleans strike, the cruel heart-breaking, blundering fiasco
of the Philadelphia waterfront, where the I.L.A. members &#8220;beat up&#8221; the
marine workers organizers, are past history, but the hurt still rankles
so long as official party misfits control the machine they have set up.
<p>Why did Mink, Johnstone and Co. deviate from the R.I.L.U. program and
not only neglect but actually refuse to build up left wing groups in the
reactionary unions? The Independent Tidewater and Boatmen&#8217;s Union was offered
them on a platter but they declined. The attitude of Mink toward the marine
worker has been one of steering contempt and it must be confessed that
the long suffering marine worker reciprocates, as witness: of a membership
of over four thousand only some four hundred remain.
<center>
<p><b><em>Workers Revolted Against Mink</em></b></center></p>

<p>Some months ago several members of the M.W.I.U. revolted against the
Losovky-Mink bureaucratic regime and formed a rank and file movement. Unfortunately
contrary to their original declaration of principles for adherence to the
defence of the Soviet Union, the Marine Workers Solidarity League as it
is called, by adopting a neo-syndicalist attitude, has slowly disintegrated
until only a small handful of &#8216;die hards&#8217; remain who are more concerned
with the quality of the stew served in their hall than the class struggle.
<p>The A.F. of L. organizations, the I.S.U. and I.L.A., are the most potent
economic organizations in the marine sphere. The present program of the
I.S.U. leadership for the 100% Americanization of the merchant marine and
the subsequent introduction of naval discipline for the avowed purpose
of forming an efficient adjunct to the U.S. Navy in time of war is steadily
forging ahead. It is significant that no Communist group has so far done
anything about it. During the longshore strike at New Orleans the I.L.A.
in keeping with their nationalist policy raised the cry: &#8220;foreigners are
scabbing on us.&#8221; <p>The concrete Naval Reserve plan of Furuseth and the raising of the foreign
element bogey with threatened mass deportation are but details of the ground
work being laid by the marine bosses for the impending imperialist war,
when worker will be pitted against worker.
<p>Harbor craft workers in this port have again felt the lash of the boss
in a recent drastic cut in wages, so that even the I.T.B.U. have been prodded
into activity. These workers in the near future will need all the aid they
can muster. With seamen signing on ships for $50 per month and two watches
(i.e., four hours on and four off) with no overtime pay for work performed
in excess of twelve hours, inferior food and hell-hole fo&#8217;c&#8217;sles, cutting
of wages on lighters so that lighter captains when their barge is not loaded
receive only a dollar per diem, wholesale slashing of wages on tow-boats
and longshore couple with increased speed-up compels one to ask, whither
the marine worker?

<p><font size=+1>NEW PUBLICATION</font>
<p><em>THE WASP, published monthly at Cleveland, Ohio,64 pages, 25 cents</em></center></p>

<p>A long felt need in the Communist movement has been filled by the publication
of the first issue of <em>The Wasp,</em> a satirical monthly magazine. It
is edited by Tom O&#8217;Flaherty, considered by many the foremost satirist in
the movement. The weakness of the magazine is that it is not tied up with
any branch of the Communist movement and is published as a free lance proposition.
Another danger is of vulgarizing problems facing the workers in an attempt
to write a light vein. While a great deal of criticism is made of the capitalism
system it is not coordinated with what is needed as a remedy. However on
the whole it is worthwhile reading, and should be obtained by those who
want a relaxation from economic and political literature. It is also a
good tract to give workers just becoming aware of the class struggle.
<p>Those who remember O&#8217;Flaherty&#8217;s brilliant daily column which appeared
regularly in the <em>Daily Worker</em> until about two years ago when he
was expelled from the Communist Party on the charge of &#8220;Trotskyism&#8221; will

<p><font size=+1>KNITGOODS WORKERS CONFERENCE</font></center></p>

<p>The Knitgoods Workers Shop Conference held at Irving Plaza on March
22 by the Knitgoods Section of the Needle Trades Workers Industrial Union
proved the great need to organize the workers of this trade whose situation
is becoming really desperate. It showed too that not without a struggle
inside the union will this object be accomplished. There were 52 delegates
from 46 shops plus 11 representatives from unorganized shops. This is a
very small number compared with the 20,000 people who work in the trade
in Greater New York. And yet if the union will be on its job, this number
can be the beginning for a good campaign.
<p>The conference was opened in a bureaucratic manner worthy of the American
Federation of Labor but not to be tolerated in any Trade Union Unity League
section. The secretary of the knit goods section, Rabinoff, introduced
Sarah Chernof as the chairman <em>Appointed by the Trade Committee.</em>
Before the delegates had time to wink an eyelash Chernof was in full swing
making a speech and without a word from the conference introduced an order
of business (also handed down by the Trade Committee).
<center>
<p><b><em>Elected Only Old Timers</em></b></center></p>

<p>Elections to credentials and resolutions committee brought forth only
the old timers such as Rappoport and Steinhart who for years have been
sitting on the organization of workers in this trade like a hen on an egg,
only this egg is never allowed to hatch.
<p>Then came the report of the trade committee by that brilliant organizer
of the textile workers of this continent (especially New Bedford) comrade
Rappoport. He spoke chiefly of the bad conditions in the industry and of
the change of the knitgoods local from the National Textile Workers Union
to the Needle Trades Workers Industrial Union. It seems that the reason
for the change is that today (owing to style in the trade), many former
cloakmakers and ladies&#8217; garment workers, union people, are now working
on knitgoods.
<p>Discussion was limited by motion to 5 minutes. I took the floor and
told first of a neat little 10% wage cut that had been handed down in the
place where I work. Then I criticized the lack of activity of the union
and also the leaflet for the conference for not making a fight against
piece work, one of the great evils for certain types of workers. Especially
I stressed the need for democracy in the union, election of chairman and
discussion of the order of business from the floor. My five minutes being
up, Chairman Chernof cut me off in spite of my efforts to continue, although
she managed to be quite lenient later to other speakers.
<p>That other delegates thought in a similar way was proved by the rest
of the discussion. One worker said it was a shame the chairman had &#8220;shut
off the first speaker whose remarks were quite interesting to the audience.&#8221; Another spoke vehemently against the bureaucratic appointment of the chairman.
<center>
<p><b><em>Worsened Conditions Brought Out</em></b></center></p>

<p>The discussion generally brought out the terrible worsening of conditions
by the crisis. Everywhere wage-cuts to the bone. Added to this the unemployment
of 50% and the uncertainty of any job. It is plain this industry, always
unorganized, poorly paid, has come to be one of the most wretchedly exploited.
There were several encouraging reports of small strikes, sometimes successful,
led by union members in the shops.
<p>Rappoport in his summing up was obliged to admit that the criticism
of bureaucratic methods was correct and ordered it to be put in the minutes
that the chairman henceforth is to be elected, and order of business proposed
from the floor. (What is happening!)
<p>The resolutions committee brought in a resolution in support of the
conference to defend the foreign-born, which was accepted unanimously.
Also another which is to be put out as a leaflet on the organization of
the trade. I took the floor here to criticize their demand for &#8220;price committee&#8221; and proposed instead, &#8220;In shops where there is piece work we fight for
price committees until such time as the union can enforce the demand for
straight time wage.&#8221; <p>I said the resolution should have come out more strongly and enthusiastically
to the effect that the N.T.W.I.U. is the only organization with the program
to fight and to organize the workers. The criticism on piece work was adopted.
<p>With a motion for the entire conference to become an organization committee
(but no time set for it to meet again), the conference adjourned.
<center>
<p><b><em>Capitulated to Lovestone</em></b></center></p>

<p>The lack of real concrete plans for organization of the industry was
the big failure of this conference. There should have been plans presented
for shop meetings, for mass meetings in different neighborhoods, for leaflet
distribution, for educational work, sports and social activities for the
youth, etc. This would have sent the delegates away enthusiastically to
rally the workers in their shops. It must be mentioned too that the N.T.W.I.U.
has capitulated to the attacks of the Lovestone group in giving up the
fight against piece work and in the question of hours.
<p>The change from the textile to the needle union has brought no new members
(since the toilers were already organized) and has lost some good silk
workers and other textile workers who were members of the old local affiliated
to the N.T.W.U. These workers cannot join a union, as there is no group
of the N.T.W.U. in New York. The withdrawal of the knitgoods workers marked
one step in the disintegration of the N.T.W.U.
<p>The conference was not broadly representative. No Negroes were present,
although some work in the trade. There were few young girls, although they
work in great numbers in the lowest paid sections of the trade as examiners,
trimmers, folders, etc. getting $12 to $15 a week.
<p>Yet there were encouraging signs. The acceptance of the criticism on
bureaucratic methods and on piece work was a distinct victory. What is
necessary now, if this conference is to mean anything, is for all workers
in the trade to join the Knitgoods Section of the N.T.W.I.U. and to fight
to force the union to do its work of organizing, to improve the wretched
conditions of the workers.

<p><font size=+1>ATTACK ON THE FOREIGN BORN</font></center></p>

<p>During recent months the capitalist class of the country has been attempting
to cover up the unemployment crisis by intensifying the campaign against
the foreign born workers. The bosses&#8217; press from New York to San Francisco
is trying to create a state of mind hostile to them implying that by deporting
the aliens the unemployment situation will be partly remedied.
<p>Since Secretary of Labor Doak took office, an intensified campaign against
the foreign born workers has been instituted. Thousands of workers have
already been deported, while hundreds more are taken in the dragnet every
week. Recently Doak announced that a special campaign against seamen would
be inaugurated. A raid on the Seamen&#8217;s Institute in New York followed with
many arrests. This is no accident. The seamen who are now in the United
States have been in many parts of the world where the workers are more
advanced politically than in this country. Many of them have been in the
Soviet Union and tell their comrades here of the achievements of the Workers
Fatherland.
<p>The deportation drive is being constructed not only to throw sand into
the workers&#8217; eyes in relation to unemployment. It is also closely tied
up with plans for the next war and a drive against the Communist movement.
In Akron, Ohio, we find Paul Kassay, a Hungarian worker, arrested and being
held for trial charged with attempting to destroy a government dirigible.
He is accused of being a Communist agent. Here we can easily see the coordination
between the drive against the foreign born, plans for the coming war and
the first move in the direction of driving the Communist movement underground.

<p><font size=+1>The Position of the Communist League of Struggle</font>
<br /><em><font size=+1>Theses Adopted, New York City, March 15, 1931</font></em>
<p>I.-THE WORLD ECONOMIC CRISIS</center></p>

<p>1. The whole capitalist world in 1931 finds itself in the throes of
a crisis shaking it to its very foundations. Whether we turn to the industrial
imperialist countries, to the agrarian, or to the colonial and semi-colonial
countries, we see the same havoc and destruction.
<p>In Great Britain (1930) industrial production fell 2-% below 1929. Textiles
fell 35%, ship building fell from over 50% of the world&#8217;s total to 39%,
coal and steel industries were particularly hard hit as well. A fall in
new capital issues occurred reaching the lowest point in six years. Exports
fell 21% in values and 18% in volume. Imports are the lowest since 1922;
exports the lowest since the war. Unemployment rose to over 3 million or
about 20% of the working population.
<p>Germany has felt the crisis even more severely. Industry as a whole
fell off 14% (1930 as below 1929). Coal and lignite fell 15%; pig iron
and steel 28%. Exports fell 18% in values from 1929 to 1930; imports fell
28%.
<p>There are 5,000,000 unemployed. 28% of all workers are unemployed and
27% on part time. In the textile industry 21% are unemployed and 41% on
part time; in chemicals 22% unemployed and 20% on part time; in shoes,
31% unemployed and 57% on part time.
<p>France was the last country to be drawn into the crisis, due to exceptional
economic conditions, (such as the high development of usurer capital and
a large <em>rentier</em> class, the large tourist trade, the big reparations
payment in kind, etc.) Chemical production fell 20% in the last year; autos
and textiles are heavily depressed. The decrease in tax returns amounts
to $20,000,000 and many bank failures are reported. Over a million are
now unemployed.
<p>In Italy heavy industry fell 29%. Wool and worsted production is only
70% of normal. Exports and imports fell 20% in values. The registered unemployed
in 1930 were 650,000&#8212;230,000 more than in 1929.
<p>In Czechoslovakia industrial production as a whole was 20% less in 1930
than in 1929. Coal consumption was 15%; building 25% less. A severe textile
crisis prevails. Exports fell 12% and imports 20%.
<p>In Japan the unemployed now number 1,000,000. Some industries are curtailed
as high as 50%. There is a widespread textile depression with two million
spindles idle. Foreign trade fell 30% in value.
<p>Even more severely hit than the major industrial countries of Europe
have been the back ward agrarian countries (Poland, Hungary, Spain, Roumania,
Jugoslavia, Baltic States). The great fall in prices of grain and raw material
(coupled with the drouth as in Hungary) have affected them greatly. Millions
of peasants live in the most intense misery in these countries.
<p>This is even more true of the non-European agrarian countries, colonial
and semi-colonial (Cuba, Central America, South America, Canada, Ausralia,
India, China). Huge stocks of coffee, sugar, tea, cotton, wheat, meat products,
frtuis, raw materials such as metals, rubber fertilizers, oil etc. have
piled up. Production is almost at a standstill. Crops are deliberate destroyed.
The masses are starving. The oppressive political regimes, the great fall
in the price of silver, etc., have intensified the economic crises in these
countries.
<p>Of all the countries in the world only the Soviet Union stands outside
the capitalist economic crisis. Unemployment there has been eliminated.
The rate of production is advancing more rapidly than in any capitalist
country. Exports rose 18.3% in value over last year. Imports rose 37.1%.
Every indication is at hand that the Five Year Plan will be fully accomplished
in the time set and even before, in spite of the very low market price
of wheat and raw materials, the basis of Russia&#8217;s foreign trade. Here is
being fully demonstrated the superiority of planned socialist production
over capitalist anarchy.
<p>2. The present crisis brings out in sharpest relief all the basic contradictions
of capitalism name (a) the contradiction between use value and exchange
value; between production for use and production for the market, for profit.
(b) the contradiction between social production and individual appropriation;
(c) the contradiction between increased use of science in production and
the tremendous waste (of the soil, of labor-power, and of materials and
means of production); (d) the contradiction between the order and despotism
in the factory and the chaos and anarchy in the market. (e) The contradiction
between the unlimited possibility for scientific advancement with increased
output and the relative diminution of the limited market. (f) the contradiction
between the falling relative value and the rise in surplus value (rate
and mass) and the increased mass of use values produced. (g) The contradiction
between the falling tendency of the rate of profit and the rising proportion
of constant to variable capital. (h) the increasing hold of dead labor
over living labor; (i) The growth of the unemployed and pauper armies with
the growth in strength and energy of capitalism; (j) The development of
private property contradicted by the expropriation of the direct producer
from the means of production and the separation of the owner from the productive
process. (k) The contradiction between city and country, between industry
and agriculture. (l) The rise of monopolies concurrently with the intensification
of competition. (m) The ruin of the rural and urban petty bourgeoisie and
the consolidation of the new petty bourgeoisie (dependent on the trusts)
and <em>rentier</em> (coupon clipper, parasitic) classes; (n) The development
of national self-sufficient systems of production coincidently with the
further internationalization of markets and division of labor. (o) The
drawing in of the most backward countries into the vortex of capitalism
simultaneously with the further colonization of these countries and the
obstruction of their development. (p) The export of capital and the increasingly
uneven development of capital.
<p>Concomitantly arise the socio-political antagonisms generated by these
economic contradictions.
<p>3. The present crisis is not quite like the crises that have occurred
before, although the basic causes are the same. These basic causes are
(a) the output per worker increases more rapidly than the total disposable
production, leading to the discharge of workers even when production is
increasing. This increased output per worker is due especially to the increased
productivity of the workers. Through the introduction, widespread application
and improvements of machinery, etc. the worker with the same amount of
labor power expended can turn out larger and larger quantities of commodities.
(b) production increases more rapidaly than the possible consumption under
capitalism. The solvent demand is greatly limited by the poverty of the
masses. While the basic causes of the crisis are the same yet we see the
following new features. (a) The crisis affects the whole world simultaneously.
(b) The crisis is far more intense than heretofore. (c) So great are the
contradictions of capitalism that today it is the crisis and stagnation
of business than is the normal long-drawn phase of economic life while
the revival and prosperity eras are the abnormal, short-lived periods.
More than ever are the words of Engels true! &#8220;The acute form of the periodical
process with its former decennial cycle seems to have given way to a more
chronic, long-drawn alteration between relatively short and slight business
improvement and a relatively long undecided depression, both of them differently
distributed over the various industrial countries &#8230; Is it possible
that we are now in a preparatory stage of a new world crash of unparalleled
vehemence?&#8221; (Volume III Capital, page 574 footnote).
<p>These new features are due (a) to the capitalist rationalization --
the &#8220;scientific&#8221; and &#8220;systematic&#8221; increase in the mass and rate of exploitation
and (thus the &#8220;scientific&#8221; sharpening of the economic contradictions and
social antagonisms of capitalism). (b) to the to the relative and absolute
diminution of world markets. (c) to the radical structural changes in world
economy.
<p>This characterization of the present world economic crisis shows clearly
that capitalism is overripe; that imperialism is the last reactionary phase
of capitalism; that the temporary and partial stabilization of post war
imperialism can not last long and is ready for its proletarian grave-diggers.
<center>
<p>II.-THE CRACKING OF CAPITALIST &#8220;STABILIZATION&#8221;</center></p>

<p>4. Before the war with the emergence of imperialism as a phase of capitalism,
already all the objective factors for socialism were present. These factors
were the following: (a) capitalism was no longer progressive but had become
reactionary, stirring the forces of production. Capitalism had reached
its last phase, imperialism, where it took a definite turn to stagnation
and decay. (b) A huge socialized technique and production of wealth ready
for socialism had been created. (c) A large mature proletariat had arisen
capable of being the instrument overthrowing the present capitalist world.
(d) a body of Marxist knowledge had become the property of the masses.
<p>Under these conditions such intense contradictions were generated and
developed as to make the whole epoch of imperialism one of wars and revolution.
Throughout the world revolutionary situations arose. To produce such revolutionary
situations certain objective changes took place. (a) The ranks of the bourgeoisie
and ruling classes were cracked. (b) The sufferings of the masses became
unbearable intense. (c) An unusually great activity of the masses occurred.
<p>However, not every revolutionary situation results in a revolution (insurrection).
To attain this a subjective factor must be added to the above objective
factors, namely: &#8220;The ability of the revolutionary classes to carry out
revolutionary mass actions strong enough to break (or to undermine) the
old government &#8230; &#8220; (Lenin).
<p>With the world war and the revolutionary wave that followed in its wake,
the epoch of imperialism entered a new stage qualitatively different from
the one existing before (from 1900 to 1914). Distinctive of this new stage
are the following: (a) the proletarian revolution is victorious in the
U.S.S.R. (b) post-war capitalism, with all its force, can not get back
to pre-war stability. The decline of capitalism can not be stopped. All
the attempts at &#8220;stabilization&#8221; become desperate efforts merely to slacken
the tempo of the international revolution. This can be seen by the fact
that, during this time, while some revolutionary situations are liquidated
by the forces of international capitalism, yet other revolutionary situations
can not be liquidated and new ones constantly arise. At the same time a
whole host of other situations begin to take on a revolutionary character.
(Germany 1923, Bulgaria 1924, Esthonia 1924, China 1925-1927, Austria,
1927, India, China, Indo China, Spain 1930, besides Mexico, Nicaragua,
Haiti, Porto Rico, Finland, etc.).
<p>Before the war, neither revolutionary situations nor actual revolutions
could have been created by the activity of the socialist, revolutionary
parties throughout the world. No matter how well or tirelessly these parties
worked, the bourgeoisie was too strong, the level of activity of the masses,
generally speaking, too low. Basically, these revolutionary situations
had to develop by themselves from the objective contradictions in capitalist
society. When, during and after the war, these objective contradictions
did cause revolutionary situations to arise, by that time the subjective
factor had become so powerful as to be able to mature such revolutionary
situations, in a number of countries, into actual revolutions. Today imperialism
has become so much weaker, today, so close is the situation in a number
of countries to a revolutionary one, that it is possible for an international
Communist movement, <em>provided it has a Leninist policy,</em> and especially
now when it controls a state backed by 163,000,000 workers and peasants,
to develop situations otherwise still non-revolutionary into revolutionary
situations in different countries at different times. (This does not mean
that a CI can &#8220;order&#8221; a revolutionary situation in any country at any time).
It is a fact that today, with the correct policy, it is far easier in many
countries to disintegrate the capitalist armies, to ruin the prestige of
the ruling classes, to expose the petty bourgeoisie, and to activize the
masses to an extraordinary degree than before.
<p>Every worker knows that, under some conditions, the activity of a Communist
group can &#8220;develop&#8221; a strike situation, where without this Communist group
no such situation would have been &#8220;developed". Today the Communist Party
(under some circumstances and with a Leninist policy) can be the decisive
force both in stimulating the exploited and oppressed masses with the understanding
of the impossibility of living in the old way and in helping to make the
ruling class unable to govern as of old. Since the war the old power and
might of the ruling classes have been irretrievably broken. Further, the
experiences of 1918-1923 weigh mightily on the memory of the masses --
the ruling classes in many countries were unable to govern at that time.
Finally the Soviet Union with its tremendous economic and political weight
will be able to throw this weight at times to as to help break the economic
and political power of different sections of the international bourgeoisie
at critical moments.
<p>Therefore it is clear that very often, the activity of revolutionary
organizations, if they estimate the economic and socio-political situation
correctly and base their strategy and tactics accordingly, if they are
rooted among the masses and have their support, can be the very decisive
factor (a) in developing ("creating") a revolutionary situation where none
exited before and (b) in maturing a revolutionary situation to an actual
successful revolution
<p>The recognition of this qualitative change in imperialism must be the
cornerstone of Communist international strategy. Today it is possible to
have &#8220;sudden&#8221; changes to revolutionary situations, &#8220;sudden&#8221; revolutions.
Today there has been raised to hitherto unheard degree the decisive importance
of revolutionary organizations, first as factors maturing ("creating")
revolutionary situation and second, as factors changing revolutionary situations
to actual revolutions (insurrections).
<p>The fatal error in the Communist &#8220;Majority Group&#8221; (Lovestone) is that
it fails to see this fundamental feature of the present stage, and to make
it an integral part of any American analysis.
<p>The fatal error of the CI and its U.S. &#8220;Leadership&#8221;, is that it caricatures
and distorts this basic conception. Not understanding it, this leadership
transforms it into a theory justifying putch-ism, making of the party a
sect more and more isolated from the masses, more and more stifled by an
absolutely sterile bureaucratic machine. The official C.P. &#8220;Leaders&#8221; in
the U.S. fail to see that an insurrection can come only after the development
of a revolutionary situation. They fail to understand that to develop this
revolutionary situation one must follow a Leninist line of mass work, such
as united front, and work in reactionary unions. One must also have a profound
economic analysis, an understanding of the peculiarities of capitalist
America, and of the true relationship of American to international capitalist
society.
<p>The result of this rear-guard putch-ist line of the CI (and their cable-correspondence
school lawyers in the U.S.) Has been to negate the influence of revolutionary
organizations to such a degree that (a) in places where a proper policy
could have led to the creation of a revolutionary situation, no such situation
ever developed (Austria, Mexico, England). (B) Where a revolutionary situation
could have led to a successful revolution matured (Spain). (C) Where a
revolution had broken out it was crushed (China, Bulgaria, Germany).
<p>The result of this negation of the decisive subjective factor has been
to give force to the theory that revolutionary situations can arise only
as in the pre-war period; that we must &#8220;wait&#8221; till such situations will
spring of themselves from the basic contradictions of capitalism.
<p>5. Since the war there has been a great intensification of the uneven
development of capitalism, an uneven development now sharply accentuated
by the present crisis.
<p>In the first place the center of economic gravity has now been shifted
from Europe to America. The U.S. is now almost equal to all of capitalist
Europe and makes up 40% of the capitalist world economy. The U.S. produced
(end of 1928) 19% of the world&#8217;s wheat, 65% of the world&#8217;s corn, 47% of
the cane sugar, 41% of the coal, 72% of the oil, 45% of all types of power,
83% of the total gas, 42% of the total electricity, 50% of the total iron
and steel, 40% of the lead, zinc and aluminum, 45% of the chemicals, 26%
of the paper pulp, 27% of the rayon, 55% of the cotton, 23% of the cotton
spindles, 80% of the autos, 40% railroads, etc.
<p>Besides this direct production, American manufacturers directly control
the production in many other countries and through agreements and cartels
dominate many industries which they do not directly control.
<p>The U.S. consumes on the average 87-90% of what it produces. It consumes
65% of the world&#8217;s rubber, 53% of the world&#8217;s tin, 48% of the coffee, 72%
of the silk.
<p>Of the total world exports the U.S. is now contributing 18%. (18% of
the world total exports of manufactured goods). 25% of the total world
wheat exports, 90% of the corn exports, 12% of the coal, 12% of the oil,
5 1/2 % of the cotton goods, 24% of electro-technical products, and 35%
of the world exports in machinery, come from the U.S. Already half of the
exports are finished commodities and two-thirds are finished and semi-finished.
<p>On the other hand the imports are moving more and more to raw materials.
U.S. takes 40% of the world oil imports, 50% of the world&#8217;s pump imports;
15% the wool imports, etc. (The figures for rubber, tin, coffee and silk
have been given above) The total weight of the U.S. imports is 12% of the
world total.
<p>Of the world&#8217;s wealth 40% is in the U.S. as compared to 45% in Europe
(including Russia). 40% of the world&#8217;s annual income is in the U.S. as
compared to 38% in Europe (including Russia). It should be noted that Europe
is still behind pre-war standards, both as to wealth and as to income.
(either mass or per-capita). While before the war the income and wealth
of the U.S. were only those of Europe, they are now greater than Europe.
Within the U.S. is to be found (March 1931) 4 1/2 billion dollars in gold
or 40% of the whole world&#8217;s supply.
<p>The basis for the U.S. hegemony throughout the capitalist world rests
upon (a) the enormous natural and power resources, (b) the great food supply,
(c) ample raw material at hand, (d) exceptional equipment and rationalized
technique, (e) huge home market, (f) lack of decisive feudal relationships,
(g) non-exhaustion through war, (h) tremendous reservoir of capital.
<p>6. As a result of the shifting of the economic center of gravity to
the U.S. a most severe struggle is now taking place between Europe and
America, between Great Britain and America, and between all the leading
capitalist powers, for world supremacy. The European capitalists feel the
tremendous impact of America. War debts payable to the U.S. amount to 12
billion dollars. Private loans of the U.S. capitalists abroad amount to
about 15 1/2 billions&#8212;- (Europe forty-eight billions, Canada four billions,
Latin America 5.5, Far East 1.2&#8212;two-thirds in government and one-third
individual corporations, railroads, and public utilities.)
<p>More and more the U.S. is becoming a decisive and integral part of world
capitalism. Whole countries are totally dependent on the economy of the
U.S. for their very existence such as Bolivia (tin), Peru, (copper) Brazil,
(coffee) Chile, (nitrates) Malay Peninsula, (rubber and tin) Cuba, (sugar)
Japan, (silk) and others.
<p>7. This impact of America imperialism has been met with desperate resistance
by the other capitalists. Europe is now rehabilitated and is giving ever
sharper battle to U.S. The reactionary Briand &#8220;U.S. of Europe&#8221; plan is
an attempt among others to consolidate continental capitalism against the
U.S. The recent attempt of France to form an &#8220;Agrarian Bloc&#8221; to meet foreign
competition is another example. Many international cartels (steel, chemical,
radio, leather, wire, textiles, zinc, glass, cement, potash etc.) Have
been formed to face growing U.S. competition. All continental European
countries now have high tariffs on manufactured goods (in 1927 the figures
were: Austria 16%, Czechoslovakia 27%, France 21%, Germany 21%, Hungary
27%, Italy 22%, Poland 32%, Spain 41%, Jugoslavia 23%, etc.)
<p>The resistance of reconstructed Europe to some extent has been successful.
In many fields (e.g. shipping) U.S. has been checked. U.S. share of the
imports of the United Kingdom fell from 18.6% in 1925 to 14.7% in 1930
(in values). In 1923 Germany imported 19.1% of her total imports from the
U.S. In 1927 this fell to 14.7%. In spite of this, Europe still lags far
below its prewar wealth and income and has barely passed its pre-war level
of production although it has a greater population than ever.
<p>8. Far from being removed from the contradictions convulsing the world,
the U.S. has become a definitely indissoluble part of world capitalism,
world markets, world division of labor. A crisis in the U.S. rapidly affects
the rest of the world. Every disturbance abroad is reflected at home.
<p>The U.S. is not an independent system. Over 30 articles absolutely needed
in time of war, over 100 products normally purchased, cannot be obtained
in the U.S. and must be imported. (antimony, camphor, chromite, iodine,
platinum, mercury, opium, nickel, mica, rubber, sodium, nitrate, tin, tungsten,
vanadium, etc.) Of the total wealth of the U.S. about 7% is invested abroad
(war debts, loans, branch factories, net foreign trade, etc.) The income
derived from this investment is then about 7% of the total income of the
U.S. The foreign trade of the U.S. was $9,640 million dollars in 1929.
All these facts show how closely the U.S. is linked up with the rest of
the world. A revolutionary crisis in Europe must rapidly and violently
affect the U.S. as well.
<p>9. A gigantic struggle is being waged between the U.S. and the British
empire for world supremacy (the recent trip of the Prince of Wales to South
America and the proposed counter-tour of Lindburgh). It is a struggle over
all parts of the world in every conceivable sphere of activity.
<p>Matching the reactionary &#8220;U.S. of Europe&#8221; of Briand, is the plan of
Mond for a self-sufficient monolithic British empire. But the centrifugal
tendencies within the British empire are demonstrating agin, and are but
accelerating its decline.
<p>The dominions (Canada, Australia) are being deeply penetrated by the
United States. (American industries in Canada alone are valued at 3 billion
dollars). These dominions are taking a more and more independent attitude
towards Great Britain. The break down of the recent Imperial Conference
bears witness to this. The growing industrialization by America of these
dominions is coming into sharp conflict with the aims Great Britain itself.
The growing foment in India and Indonesia and revolution in China are dealing
death blows to the Tories&#8217; reactionary hopes.
<p>10. The international export of capital has but greatly intensified
the uneven development of capitalism and sharpened its contradictions.
The floor of capital to the various colonies far from decolonizing these
countries has emphasized their colonial status. Under the impact of this
import of capital the colonies are becoming industrialized, but the industrialization
does not result in an all rounded development of those colonies. On the
contrary this rounded development becomes thoroughly checked. The colonies
live but for the imperialist country. The most reactionary elements (feudal-military
regime, usurer, country gentry, etc.) are all the more firmly foisted on
the masses. The native bourgeoisie become thoroughly penetrated by foreign
capital. In the main it is but the face and tool of the foreign imperialists.
The formation of large scale factories on the other hand, bring forth a
strong and modern, independent proletariat.
<p>It is similar with the relatively backward and politically &#8220;independent&#8221; countries (South America, and to some extent, Canada, Australia, etc. They
are penetrated through and through by foreign imperialists. Some of their
industries are developed but mostly those not in competition but rather
supplementing those of the dominant imperialist country. The native bourgeoisie
becomes but the puppet of the foreign imperialists, while the proletariat
pressed more and more, becomes more and more self reliant and developed.
The invasion of international capital brings with it the economic and political
penetration of the agrarian country by the foreign power.
<p>11. The economic effects of the crisis must only greatly aggravate the
very causes that lead to the present crisis and lay the basis for still
more catastrophic crisis in the future.
<p>First of all a tremendous intensification of rationalization is taking
place. In Great Britain, Manchester, the very home of free competition,
is now the scene of amalgamation of all cotton mills. Trustification is
becoming accelerated, actively aided by the largest banks of the empire.
The demand is growing for the creation of a tariff to protect Great Britain&#8217;s
industries. &#8220;Mondism&#8221; has become the dominant philosophy. With the aid
of the Labor Party the employers have cut wages everywhere, lengthened
hours, and speeded up, (coal, textile, etc.)
<p>In Germany this has been done on an even greater scale. A national wage
cut of 10% has been given. In Italy a 12% cut for all workers and employees
was recently announced. The Fascist government is doing all it can to rationalize
Italian economy. Everywhere, both the rural and urban petty bourgeoisie
face ruin. The full weight of rationalization however, hits the working
class.
<p>Secondly, the struggle for markets has reached its most acute stage
since the war. Each nation literally wars against all the others. (German-Austria
Anschluss, tariff war between Hungary, Czechoslovakia, etc.) In the course
of the crisis Germany and Czechoslovakia have improved their export positions
over England and France on the continent. The U.S. has flooded the export
market (in 1929 the difference between the U.S. exports over imports amounted
to 841 million dollars. In 1930 the difference was 782 million dollars,
a sum larger than most years, in spite of the great fall of prices. Many
international cartels have fallen to pieces and others in the making fail
to materialize. France&#8217;s agrarian bloc collapsed. A great cry is being
raised against the dumping of wheat by the American Farm Board. Great Britain&#8217;s
Imperial Conference with the dominions fell through. Tariff barriers (U.S.,
Canada, etc.) are being raised everywhere. The recent proffered resignation
of the chairman of the economic and financial section of the League of
Nations was an emphatic recognition of the impossibility of the League
of Nations &#8220;to harmonize the interests of the family of nations.&#8221; <p>Thirdly, the &#8220;scissors&#8221; between the agrarian and the industrial countries
is being aggravated on a world scale. Prices of grains, raw stuffs, fell
as low as 50% in some cases. On the other hand prices of finished goods
fell but 10-15%. This has meant an even greater subjugation of these countries
by the leading imperialist countries. The debtor countries are unable to
meet their debts and must borrow further. (note recent heavy loans to Roumania,
Italy, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Spain and South American countries.
The great monetary crisis in China, etc.) Even Germany despite the most
heroic efforts by its bourgeoisie has failed to balance its budget and
has been forced to borrow close to $100,000,000.
<p>The world crisis most seriously intensifies the uneven development of
capitalism. The weaker countries become still weaker, further and further
penetrated by the leading powers. The debtor countries become still more
indebted, the colonies and semi-colonies still more enslaved, the struggle
among the leading powers still more intense.
<p>12. A greatly increased political instability is one of the direct results
of the crisis. Here is the clearest indication of how transient and ephemeral
the much vaunted &#8220;stabilization&#8221; of capitalism is. While we do not declare
that this is the basic final crisis of capitalism yet the political and
revolutionary crisis in different parts of the world make it plain that
such a final crisis of capitalism is not out of the question. The revolutionary
movement must grasp this idea thoroughly and make it one of the cornerstones
of Communist policy. Much depends on the understanding and practice of
the international Communist movement.
<p>The sharper struggle for markets is leading the foremost imperialist
powers into a great military-naval race, preparatory to war. The complete
failure of the disarmament conferences, the naval races between the U.S.
and England, France and Italy, the new German Cruiser &#8220;B&#8221;, the revision
upward of the Japanese fleet, all bear witness to this. The armed forces
and military budgets stand higher than ever. On this field too the League
of Nations has demonstrated its complete futility.
<p>The League of nations, indeed, is facing a crisis of its own. The hostility
of the U.S., the Briand &#8220;U.S. of Europe&#8221; plan, partly aimed at Great Britain,
the attack on the Versailles treaty by Germany aided by Austria, Hungary,
Italy and others and the attitude of the Soviet Union are giving fatal
blows to the League of Nations as a whole.
<p>13. The present world situation has thrown many countries into a profound
political crisis. Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Panama, have all experienced
actual political revolutions. Rumors of political revolutions shake all
the other countries of Latin America. These &#8220;palace revolutions&#8221; are primarily
the result of the changed relation of forces in South America between the
United States and Great Britain. On the whole, the United States (especially
in Argentina) has greatly benefitted by the change of puppets in power
and has consolidated its position. On the other hand, these coups d&#8217;etat
show the desperate plight of these countries, and the growing hostility
of the masses to the ruling regimes.
<p>The agrarian countries of Europe find themselves in a precarious position.
The recent heavy loans to these countries are attempts to bolster up the
existing political rulers. Particularly, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary and
Roumania face intense situations. In Spain the political crisis has reached
a most acute stage, and has already been transformed into a revolutionary
crisis.
<p>Recently riots have taken place in Adelaide, Australia. A marked growth
of the left to is be noticed in New South Wales. The Labor Government there
has refused to pay debts, and has announced a &#8220;program for socialism in
three years.&#8221; <p>In the colonial countries, revolutions and revolutionary situations
are abundant. The present situations in Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Philippines,
India, China, bear witness to this.
<p>14. In India the movement has rapidly advanced, (taking the form still
of resistance to tax gatherers, strikes, riots, civil disobedience, no-rent
campaigns etc.) The London Indian Parley, the release of many prisoners
in India, and the proposed new Indian constitution are measures forced
upon the British imperialists by the Indian masses. The betrayal of the
movement by Ghandi &amp; Co. will but deepen the movement and revolutionize
it still further. The effect of the world crisis presents a greater opportunity
to the Indian revolutionists than ever before.
<p>The basic slogans for the Communists today in India must be Lenin&#8217;s
"Three Pillars&#8221; that is, a basic slogan for the proletariat (say the 8
hour day) a basic slogan for the peasantry (confiscation of the land) and
the slogan of Democratic Republic. To these &#8220;three pillars&#8221; the slogan
"Freedom for India&#8221; must be added. Only around all these slogans can the
masses be effectively mobilized. It would be a gross error for the Communists
to stress the slogan of Freedom for India alone as does the nationalist
Indian bourgeoisie. The slogan for &#8220;Constituent Assembly&#8221; by itself is
not incorrect, but is complete and may be dangerous, for it does not take
into consideration the fact that British Imperialism can maneuver so as
to make the slogan of Constituent Assembly a SUBSTITUTE for a democratic
republic. The slogan, Constituent Assembly, can be used correctly only
in conjunction with the slogan for a Democratic Republic.
<p>The slogan of Soviets can be appropriate only when a sufficiently acute
revolutionary situation has been engendered around the &#8220;three pillars&#8221;,
when the class struggle and civil war rage in the villages and towns. In
this connection it must be emphasized that Soviets can be built even while
using the slogan of Constituent Assembly. The two slogans of Constituent
Assembly and Soviets need not be antagonistic at all times. But what must
be stressed is the actual organization of civil war in the village and
town and the leadership of the proletariat in this civil war. Only the
dictatorship of the proletariat in India can make permanent its revolution.
<p>The Communists must make plain to the masses the role of the nationalistic
Indian bourgeoisie and the role of Ghandi as an agent of this class. Not
only the experiences of 1921 must be gone over, but all the treacherous
actions of the present Ghandi campaign (the salt campaign, the anti-machine
movement, passive resistance, opposition to workers, records at the Nationalistic
Congress, the Delhi Truce, etc. etc.,) must be elaborated. Simultaneously
mass movements in town and country against native usurer, gentry, well-to-do
peasant, bourgeois, must be effected. By no means must the Chiang Kai Shek
disaster be repeated. The criminal negligence of the CI in failing to build
the Communist Party but in building worker-peasant parties instead must
be speedily liquidated. (It is clear it is not OUR business to organize
peasant parties).
<p>It is plain that the main task of the Communists must be the smashing
of all caste and religious barriers and the stimulation of movements of
the masses around the &#8220;Three Pillars&#8221; and freedom slogans. These movements,
directed against both native and foreign rulers and bourgeoisie, soon break
any united front with the native bourgeoisie who may desire a nationalist
revolutionary movement under the sole slogan of &#8220;Freedom for India&#8221; from
the British. Nevertheless, and this is most important to understand, so
long as a section of the nationalist Indian bourgeoisie is heading the
fight against British Imperialism under the slogan of &#8220;Freedom for India&#8221; from Imperialist rule, it is necessary for the Communists to enter this
united front. So long as this movement unleashes the energy of the masses
which otherwise could not be unleashed, and so long as the masses have
not been actively mobilized around the correct slogans and while the exposure
of the native bourgeoisie is but in its incipiency, the Communists must
enter national revolutionary movements. That this national revolutionary
front temporarily contains sections of the nationalist revolutionary bourgeoisie
(whom the masses follow) that the sole slogan is &#8220;Freedom for India&#8221; from
British Imperialism and that later the united front will have to be broken
by the development of the class struggle in the villages and towns of India
does not alter our present tactic. The center of attack must be against
British Imperialism and its conscious reactionary agents within India.
<p>15. China. It is now abundantly clear that the Chinese masses are recovering
from the crushing defeat of 1927. The Chinese Revolution is agin on the
upgrade. Strikes are increasing in the cities. (1928&#8212;400,000 on strike,
1929&#8212;750,000). The monetary crisis in China and the pressure of the world
crisis has enormously accentuated the terrible misery of the masses in
the city as well as in the country. Fame is taking the country side. (56,000
people affected!) A huge peasant guerrilla warfare is being successfully
waged in the interior of China, covering at least six provinces and 30
million people. The Communists must stimulate, support, organize and lead
this peasant movement. On the other hand, it must be clear that no matter
how much the Imperialists and native Chinese rulers may be weakened, armed
peasant bands cannot take the place of mass peasant uprisings, the peasant
movement can not take the place of a proletarian struggle, and peasant
"soviets&#8221; cannot replace the dictatorship of the proletariat.
<p>The crime of the CI in China was not that the C.P. of China in 1925
joined a national revolutionary front but that the CI SUBSTITUTED the Kuomintang
for the Communist Party. It thus succumbed to Sun Yat Sen-ism, introduced
class collaboration in place of class struggle, sacrificing the class struggle
to this national revolutionary front against foreign imperialism. It failed
to raise the &#8220;Three Pillars&#8221; slogans to lead the civil war in village and
town on concrete demands of the masses against the native exploiters as
well.
<p>Today the slogan of Constituent Assembly is still correct in China.
In this respect the situation may be considered generically the same as
the one in India, or the one in Russia after the defeat of the 1905 Revolution.
<p>The colonial revolutionary situations in China and India are of the
greatest importance to the rest of the world. The independent role of a
hardened revolutionary million-headed proletariat competent to lead coupled
with the inevitable betrayal of the anti-imperialist struggle by the native
bourgeoisie and ruling class demonstrates again that only the proletariat
MUST take the leadership of the struggle into its hands. Only the proletariat
can complete the bourgeois democratic revolution. In China and India as
in Russia, the workers in alliance with the peasantry must establish not
a democratic dictatorship of the workers and peasants, but a dictatorship
of the proletariat. This is the lesson of the Russia Revolution.
<p>16. The effect of the crisis has been to sharpen tremendously the internal
contradictions in all the leading capitalist countries of Europe. A great
growth of budgets has taken place due to military expenditures and increased
payments to unemployed. (In England direct drain on the treasury due to
unemployment rose from fifty-eight million in 1928 to an estimated two-hundred
and seventy-five million dollars in 1931. The total payments in 1931 will
equal 700 million dollars.) Simultaneously the revenues have been much
curtailed. The result is great increase in forced loans by practically
all government and great increase of debts. (England has the greatest debt
in its history, Germany has just had to borrow close to $100,000,000, etc.)
The fall in prices makes the payment of war reparations more onerous than
ever. The continued rationalization coupled with the crisis has made the
masses truly desperate. Real wages fell in Germany, France, Czechoslovakia,
etc. A growing unrest is present. The 4 1/2 million Communist vote evidences
this. All the elements of a revolutionary situation are appearing in Germany
(and similarly throughout Middle Europe). We must bear in mind that the
masses of middle Europe, particularly in the defeated countries, have an
income and standards of living far below pre-war, and what is most significant
have absolutely no reserve power (all savings were wiped out after the
war) to withstand a long-drawn economic crisis. A new strike wave is occurring
in Great Britain (mining, textile, railroad situation etc.) A distinct
move to the left is to be seen in a section of the Labor Party.
<p>Preparing for the most violent conflicts fascism is strengthening itself.
In Italy and in Poland the fascist state has consolidated itself (note
the Pilsudski &#8220;victory&#8221; at the last elections). In Finland a violent anti-Communist
campaign has raged. In Austria the fascist forces grow with those forces
in Germany.
<p>The growth of fascism in the leading industrial countries of Europe
(England and Germany) shows more than anything else the fear of revolution
on the part of the bourgeoisie. In England Sir Mosley breaks with the Labor
Party to form a fascist party. In Germany the fascists have won truly outstanding
victories (vote over 6 million). The growth of fascism in these two industrial
countries shows to what desperate straits the whole bourgeoisie even the
highest is put.
<center>
<p>III.-FASCISM--A CONSTANT AND GROWING DANGER</center></p>

<p>17. The complete confusion of the Communists on the question of fascism
at the very moment when the fascist movement is showing alarming symptoms
of growth makes necessary a detailed analysis of fascism.
<p>Historically, fascism appears as a dominant movement in those countries
which, next to the Soviet Union, were the weakest links in the imperialist
chain which the masses were breaking. Fascism thus is a post-war movement
basically directed against Communism and formed by the bourgeoisie to liquidate
the proletarian revolution threatening its power. For fascism to arise
the following characteristics had to be present (a) instability of capitalist
relationships, (b) a considerable amount of de-classed social elements
(such as ex-soldiers), (c) pauperization of the urban petty-bourgeoisie
and intelligentsia, (d) crisis among the peasants, (e) threatening proletarian
action to seize and to hold state power.
<p>Fascism first arose in countries predominantly agrarian though with
a well developed and considerable industry and commerce (Italy, Hungary,
Poland). Fascism with its merging of all interests of bourgeois society
within itself alone, arises only because of (1) the great pressure of international
finance capital (2) the decisive role of large scale corporate and trustified
industry (where interest bearing capital supersedes entrepreneur capital)
in the country. (3) The desperate crisis within the bourgeois ranks and
the prime necessity to take advantage of the breathing space granted it
by the muddled actions of the proletariat. These conditions forced all
conflicting bourgeois interests temporarily, to become united in order
to mobilize all layers of the petty bourgeois for violent struggle against
the proletariat.
<p>18. Fascism accelerates state capitalism but not every development of
state capitalism is fascism. State capitalism and public property grew
enormously during the war and afterward, in all countries. Fascism is the
violent development of corporate and state capitalism (with its semipublic
and public property,) creating its own governmental forms.
<p>Nor is every reactionary movement fascism. Fascism is not royalism though
royalists may be fascists, nor is it Bonapartism. Fascism is the open dictatorship
of the bourgeoisie, with the aid of the petty-bourgeoisie, against the
workers. It arises at a time when capitalism had no further use for its
classical parliamentarism, when democracy as a bourgeois class state had
become thoroughly exposed to the masses. Imperialism-reactionary, monopoly
capitalism, had already taken away the economic base for the &#8220;check and
balance&#8221; system of 19<sup>th</sup> century democracy, with its &#8220;talking
shop&#8221; parliaments and many independent parties. The war had emphasized
the complete bankruptcy of political liberalism.
<p>Fascism openly replaces the &#8220;democratic&#8221; slogans of &#8220;Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity&#8221; with the slogans of &#8220;Responsibility, Hierarchy, Discipline".
Instead of &#8220;peaceful legal action of the majority&#8221; fascist theory openly
calls for violent action of the minority.
<p>Fascism, then builds up a complete theory of nationalization of capital,
of the untrammeled corporate state, of compulsory class collaboration (prohibition
of strikes, murder of militant workers, etc.) of the dominant role of religion
in state and life.
<p>19. Fascism and social-democracy (with syndicalism) are the right and
left arms of the bourgeoisie. Nothing marks better the degeneration of
the Comintern since the death of Lenin than the identification of social
democracy and fascism and the theory of &#8220;social-fascism&#8221; that now passes
muster in Communist ranks. Fascism has an entirely different role than
social democracy. While fascism is a violent minority attack from above,
with forces recruited mainly outside the working class, social democracy
is a passive reformism demoralizing the ranks of the workers from within.
Social democracy (and syndicalism) prepare the way for fascism.
<p>Fascism from the very beginning borrows its political program, its social
demagogy, from the reformist socialists. The bourgeoisie, through the Fascists
in their desperate effort for time, promise everything. Mussolini&#8217;s original
1919 platform stood, among other things, for annexation of Fiume and Dalmatia,
universal suffrage for men and women, proportional representation, reduction
of age of deputies, abolition of Senate, economic councils with legislative
power elected by professional groups, eight hour day by law, management
of industries by those workers&#8217; organizations which prove capable of it
(i.e., workers&#8217; control), nationalization of munitions plants, heavy capital
levy, confiscation of certain church property and abolition of certain
clerical privileges, heavy inheritance tax, seizure of 85% of war profits
and revision of military contracts, for a republic (later changed)! The
central slogan was made &#8220;Class peace in production, class war in distribution".
<p>Fascism in Germany shows the same social demagogy (union with Austria,
abolition of unearned income, complete repayment of war profits, nationalization
of great trusts and a share in the profits, against the Young Plan, the
League of Nations and the Versailles Treaty, against international finance
capital, against usurer, speculator, and profiteer, and anti-semitic, for
a national economic parliament and participation of workers in industry,
etc.)
<p>The fascists show the same demagogic flexibility in their tactics. They
give special place to the ex-soldier. They even pretend to lead some strikes
and to aid the peasantry in confiscating the large landed estates. In Italy,
leading fascists, after the seizure of power, proposed unemployment bureaus,
no discharge of workers at will of employers after trial, classification
of workers and minimum wage, standard hour wage, one week vacation, sickness,
death, unemployment and other insurance, etc.
<p>Reformist social democracy prepared the ground for and aids fascism.
The socialists&#8217; attacks on Russia and on the Communists, their class collaboration
practices, their national socialism, their concrete support of rationalization
and of compulsory arbitration, their theory of &#8220;State Socialism&#8221; with compensation
to owners; these theories and practices prepare the ideological and tactical
base for fascism (note the formation of &#8220;Socialist Fascists&#8221; who affirm
&#8217;fascism is the first step to socialism&#8217;). Dependent on the given relationship
of forces, the bourgeoisie now uses social-democracy, now fascism to defeat
the workers.
<p>20. In the trade union movement fascism borrows the slogans of syndicalism
(no politics in the union, federalism and local autonomy, reduction of
salaried officials to a minimum, referendum, low union dues, industrial
unionism, etc.)
<p>The fascist &#8220;unions&#8221; like &#8220;company unions&#8221; are not really &#8220;unions&#8221; at
all but strike-breaking, stool pigeon organizations. The fascist &#8220;unions&#8221; differ from &#8220;company unions&#8221; in that the former are national industrial
bodies. Under the fascists the regimentation of the workers becomes more
complete. The &#8220;unions&#8221; become connected with the state, their contracts
recognized by law.
<p>The fascist &#8220;unions&#8221; (officially religious) supplement the criminal
work of the &#8220;catholic&#8221; or &#8220;christian&#8221; unions. Both are class collaboration
agencies, the latter demoralize the workers with pacifist persuasion, or
religious non-resistance; the former aid the capitalists with violent attacks
in every possible manner.
<p>We must reject as the rankest drivel and poisonous nonsense the &#8220;theory&#8221; of the Communist Party misleaders that the reactionary &#8220;free&#8221; unions such
as the American Federation of Labor are &#8220;outright fascist". Such a &#8220;theory&#8221; runs counter to the whole of Leninist thought that fascism can find little
base among the workers, even the skilled. It displays a menshevist distrust
for the masses, an overestimation of the strength of the enemy which, unless
it is stamped out, spells disaster for the Communist movement.
<center>
<p>IV.-THE POSITION OF THE SOVIET UNION</center></p>

<p>21. The situation within the Soviet Union, our Fatherland, must be of
the utmost concern for us. The difficulty and delicacy of the subject must
lead not to less discussion but to more. There is no question but that,
on the whole, here comrade Trotsky was correct both in stressing industrialization
and the necessity of a &#8220;plan,&#8221; and in proposing an intensification of the
war on the kulak. When we recall Bucharin&#8217;s slogan to the peasantry &#8220;Enrich
yourselves&#8221; and how there was solemnly discussed in Russia the possibility
of the &#8220;kulaks growing into Socialism,&#8221; when we recall the arguments that
any plan of industrialization was &#8220;premature&#8221; and would lead to terrible
catastrophes and &#8220;war in the village,&#8221; when we recall how backward the
original industrialization plans were and how far the masses outstripped
the &#8220;Party Leaders,&#8221; then the conclusion is ripe that the attack on comrade
Trotsky on this question only hid the right opportunism of the Stalin-Bucharin
regime.
<p>The five year plan, belated as it was, and its speedy execution, mark
a tremendous step forward. The industrialization of the Soviet Union must
tend greatly to strengthen the revolutionary movement and to hasten the
end of capitalism. But the economic progress of the U.S.S.R. does not by
itself <em>necessarily</em> lead to an advance of the world revolution. If
with such an economic advance there should be fastened upon the Communist
parties still more the theory of building socialism in one country, if
this should lead to a further nationalist viewpoint, if this should fasten
the hold of the bureaucrats still more, if this should lead to Trotsky
deportations and Blumkin murders and violence to every Communist opposition
movement, then indeed it is possible to state that unless the Communists
throughout the world (aided by the very economic advance of the Soviet
Union) can guard against this degeneration from Leninism, it is possible
to have an economic advance of the Soviet Union simultaneously with a setback
to the world proletarian revolution. Trotsky&#8217;s exposure of the elements
of Thermidor generating within the Soviet Union is correct.
<p>22. The energetic carrying through of the Five Year Plan is demonstrating
the growing strength of the Soviet Union and the superiority of socialist
planned production over the anarchic capitalist method. This truly heroic
advance is taking place in spite of all attempts to create a credit blockade
or to prohibit all imports of Soviet goods and in spite of the terrifically
low prices of grain and other products which the S.U. must export.
<p>All industry in the 1929-1930 period had a level 100% above the pre-war
level of the years 1926-1927. In 1930 the total increase in production
was 24.2% (the Plan called for a 21.5% increase). The actual increase has
been 30.2 million tons. Coal production in the two years of the Plan has
increased 86.6 million tons; iron ore 17.4 million tons, pig iron 9 million,
steel ingots 10.3 million, tractor production has increased by 12,600 units,
shoes by 102 million pairs, matches by 16 million boxes, rubbers by 85
million pairs, cotton cloth 51 1/4 metres, electrical machinery by 400
million dollars and agricultural machinery by 230 million dollars.
<p>The prolongation of the struggle between the Capitalist world and the
Soviet Union has led to the illusion in some circles that the S.U. can
coexist peacefully of for a long period of time with the rest of the world.
Such a theory is extremely dangerous to the workers. It is a class-collaboration
theory. It must be completely eradicated. A life and death struggle is
going on between these systems of economy.
<p>23. The base causes for the failure of the foreign capitalists to overthrow
the Soviets are the following (a) The enormous and inaccessible territory
and the economic self-sufficiency of the country, (b) the numerical and
moral strength of the population led by a hardened Communist Party, (c)
The failure of the bourgeoisie to unite in time, (d) the weakening of the
bourgeoisie by revolutionary movements of the masses (e) the loyal and
tremendous support of the international working class.
<p>On the other hand the Workers&#8217; Fatherland was unable to defeat the capitalists
decisively due to the following: (a) The capitalist reservoir of the U.S.
was able to strengthen and rehabilitate the European bourgeoisie (b) The
working masses outside of the S.U. were unable to seize and hold power
due primarily to the weakness of the Communist movement (c) Russian economy
was relatively weak. On the one hand this weakness (coupled with the complete
economic breakdown after the war) prevented the S.U. from defeating the
enemy. On the other hand, due to the indecisive role of Russian economy,
the Russian market could be lost without at once disastrously affecting
capitalist economy.
<p>This can be seen by the following figures showing the weight of Russia
in world economy in 1927 (total production then about pre-war). At that
time Russia produced but 2.8% of the world coal, 6.6% of the oil, 7% of
the water power, 2% of the electricity, 3.5% of the iron, 4% of the steel,
1.3% of the copper, 4.2% of the chemicals, 7% of the ships, 8% of the railroads.
Its imports were but 1.3% of the whole world total (U.S. exports to Russia
in 1928 were but 1.3% of the U.S. total exports). Its exports are but 1.1%
of the world total (Russian imports to the U.S. are but .#% of the U.S.
total.) The prewar wealth of Russia was lower than that of Germany, France
or the United Kingdom, its per capita wealth the lowest by far of any capitalist
country. (In 1926 Russia&#8217;s wealth equaled but 10% of Europe&#8217;s alone, or
little over 4% of the world&#8217;s wealth.) Russia&#8217;s prewar per capita income
was also the lowest in the capitalist world. It is this indecisive importance
of the Russian economy that explains why the capitalist world did not immediately
go to pieces on the loss of Russia.
<p>24. The Soviet Union can remain self-sufficient only on the lowest pre-capitalist
technical plan. The developments of industry in the Soviet Union, the Five
Year Plan, the necessity to strengthen rapidly and materially the dictatorship
of the proletariat if the Workers Fatherland is to ward off the blows of
the enemy and face the present tense situation, mean a greater extension
of foreign trade in and out of Russia, a more complex economic interrelationship
between the S.U. and the capitalist world.
<p>The Soviet Union can not remove itself from its capitalist environment.
While in its internal economy it is in a peculiar transition period, laying
the basis for Socialism, yet as part of a world dominated by capitalism,
it must be affected by capitalist markets, and prices. These prices must
vitally affect the Soviet economy and its growth, quantitatively, and qualitatively.
<p>The increasing imports of the Soviet Union must make the Russian markets
more desired by the capitalists than ever. A big drive must be initiated
by the Communists for large, long-term credits to the Soviet Union. This
is particularly appropriate at the present time, in the time of crisis.
These credits would ease the position of the S.U. considerably and would
strengthen the dictatorship.
<p>The growth of exports of the S.U. has well caused the capitalist world
the gravest apprehensions. The growth of these exports intensifies the
contradictions of capitalism and hastens its end. The Comintern controlling
the S.U. can thus play a decisive and creative role in disintegrating the
capitalist world and helping to usher in the successful world revolution.
Already the export of grain, oil, timber, pulp, furs, cotton, etc. is being
felt throughout the world. Frantic attacks against Soviet &#8220;dumping&#8221; are
being made but to no avail. The masses rejoice at the lowering of prices.
The planned economy of the S.U. is already proving itself superior to that
of the whole capitalist world.
<p>25. All the signs point to a much heightened danger of war of the capitalist
nations against the Soviet Union. The crisis makes the seizure of the Russian
market all the more desirable. The fear of the Five Year Plan, the Soviet
competition on world markets, the consolidation of the proletarian dictatorship,
the growing disintegration within their own ranks, all these factors are
impelling the capitalists to actual war. The trial of the <em>saboteurs</em>
has clearly exposed the plots of the imperialists aided by the socialists.
The Chinese Eastern R.R. affair, the world wide religious crusade against
the Soviet Union, the training of 100,000 white guards in Paris, the Fish
Committee report, and the U.S. embargo on Soviet pulpwood, etc., the attack
on the Soviet representative in Japan, all these are part of the barrage
precedent to actual warfare against the Soviet Union. Now more than ever
the working class throughout the world must rally to the unconditional
defense of the Soviet Union.
<center>
<p>V.-THE ECONOMIC CRISIS IN THE U.S.</center></p>

<p>26. The tremendous stock exchange crash November 1929 coincided and
helped usher in the most serious economic crisis in the entire history
of the United States. Given the average year of the years 1923 to 1925
as equal to 100, then the total manufacturing production fell from 119
(1929) to 83 (1930) (or 30%), total mineral production from 115 (1929)
to 92 (1930) or 20%, steel from 131 to 65 (or 50% drop), iron from 118
to 62 (or 49% drop), autos from 135 to 39 (or fall of 71%!). Cotton consumption
fell from 115 to 81 (fall of 30%). The lumber, non-ferrous, petroleum and
other industries also were particularly hard hit. Car loadings fell from
48 1/2 million (11 months 1929) to 43 million (same period 1930) or about
15%.
<p>Domestic wholesale and retail trade fell 10% (mail order houses fell
30%). Postal receipts dropped 14%. Foreign trade fell from $9,640 million
to $6,904 million or a drop of 28%. Imports fell about 30% in value, exports
27%; in volume imports fell 15%, exports 19%.
<p>How deep the business stagnation has reached can be seen from the following:
building contracts 1930 were but 50% of 1929; unfilled orders generally
fell from 81 to 64.5 (or drop of 21%); U.S. steel orders from 87 to 76
(drop of 13%); textile orders fell 50% from the 1925-1929 yearly average.
Lumber stocks on hand rose to 82% over 1925-1929 yearly average, raw material
stock rose 26% over the same period, textiles 27%, metals 24%. Given 1923-1925
yearly average as 100, commodity stocks rose generally, cotton from 127
to 265, refined copper from 78 to 327, etc.
<p>Life insurance sales fell 4%, N.Y. bank debits fell 37%, stock sales
28%, new capital issues 31% in 1930 over 1929.
<p>27. The present economic crisis in the United States is far more profound
than any ever before experienced. This can be seen best by contrasting
the present crisis with the 1919-1922 period in the United States. The
U.S. was able to recover relatively quickly then, due primarily to the
weakened condition of capitalist Europe and the great demand by Europe
on U.S. economic support for its rehabilitation and reorganization. Today
Europe has already been rehabilitated and stands as the bitter competitor
of the U.S. Whereas a rapid recovery took place in 1922, no such recovery
can be expected in 1931.
<p>Counting 1920 as 100, general business fell from 111 in 1919 to 94 in
1921, a drop of 17 points or 15%. Counting 1929 as 100, there is a fall
from 105 in 1928 to 81 at end of 1930, a drop of 24 points or 23%. Considering
the average year of the period 1923-1925 as 100, then the 1919 crisis saw
a drop in industrial production from 80 to 66 or 14 points (20%). Today
the plants are operating but 60% of the 1929 total man-hours! Imports fell
11%, and exports 12% below 1921.
<p>The present crisis, then is already approximately twice as severe as
the largest crisis ever experienced in this country. This does not mean
the U.S. is as yet on the decline, as is Great Britain, or imperialism
as a whole, The law of uneven development of capitalism may permit the
U.S. capitalists to emerge temporarily as strong or even stronger than
ever. However it is crass opportunism to believe that tha U.S. will be
the first to recover, or that capitalism in the U.S. Will &#8220;reach new peaks
only to fall to new lows&#8221; (Lovestone). Quite the contrary, the cracking
of capitalist &#8220;stabilization&#8221; is making more and more probable the approach
of a world wide political and revolutionary crisis which must drag in the
U.S. as well.
<p>28. Most acutely has the crisis affected the agrarian toilers in this
country. If before 1929 they were in a chronic crisis, now they are truly
in desperate straits. The development of capitalism in agriculture has
led to a sharp differentiation among the agrarians. On the one hand we
note in the period 1920-1928 the rise in importance of &#8220;factory farming".
The number of agricultural laborers in proportion to farmers has increased.
Mechanization of farming has grown by leaps and bounds; production per
acre and per laborer greatly augmented. On the other hand, over 3 million
of the farm population were forced to leave the farms, expropriated from
the means of production. Total acreage decreased by 13 million acres. The
purchasing power of the farmer (1929) fell to 80% of 1919. Mortgages increased
to $10 billion or 25%. Tenancy has greatly increased. Peonage is still
widespread. The conditions among the toilers of the South and Southwest,
particularly the Negroes, are worse than those even of eastern capitalist
Europe!
<p>In 1930, although the volume of production was about the same the value
of 44 corn excepted crops was but 72% of that of 1929. (Tobacco values
fell to 77% of 1929, cotton to 55%, wheat to 61%, corn to 67%.)
<p>To this drastic fall in prices must be added the impoverishment of wide
masses of farmers due to the effects of the corn drought, and river floods.
On top of it all has come the bankruptcy of many farm banks and the sharply
growing &#8220;scissors,&#8221; the growing gap between manufactured and trustified
industries and agriculture. While agricultural prices fell 45-50% in many
cases, wholesale prices generally of industrial commodities fell but 10-15%.
(Less for finished and manufactured goods than for semi-finished or unfinished).
<p>There is no other outcome for the mass of farmers in this country than
stark ruin. None of the capitalist schemes have been of any avail except
to drive the farmer down still further. The rise in tariff rates has availed
the dirt farmer nothing. The scheme of a Federal Grain Board with* a revolving
fund of 1/2 billion dollars has proven completely bankrupt. The dumping
of wheat by the Grain Board has lowered prices still further. The appropriations
are but drops in a bucket. The sole remedy proposed is for the farmer to
curtail production, to destroy his crop and his means of production, to
become bankrupt!. This policy was actually approved in the <em>Daily Worker</em>
editorial of August 7th, 1930!
<center>
<p>VI.-THE PRESENT STRAINED POLITICAL SITUATION</center></p>

<p>29. A strained political situation is looming in the United States.
For the first time in the history of the U.S., Congress is practically
deadlocked in both houses. The small income tax returns and the extraordinary
expenses have caused dissatisfaction in the ranks of the administration
bourgeois supporters. Every effort is being made to unload the dull cost
of the crisis on the masses. Opposition to the administration is increasing.
Despite Hoover, the majority of the Wickersham Committee came out against
the Prohibition Amendment. Over the head of the president, Congress passed
appropriations for farm and drought &#8220;relief&#8221; and overruling the presidential
veto, passed the Veteran &#8220;Relief&#8221; Act.
<p>In the Democratic Party a deep rift is taking place (struggle between
Roosevelt and Tammany Hall and Smith-Raskob vs. the South). In the Republican
Party the &#8220;liberal&#8221; insurgents have organized themselves into a separate
conference, meeting conjointly with &#8220;liberal&#8221; Democrats. A strong move
is being made for the organization of a third party for the 1932 elections.
The growing demand for social insurance, the impoverishment of the farmers,
the effects of the economic crisis are all forces leading certain sections
of the bourgeoisie to attempt a new Third Party in order to divert the
resentment of the masses into safe channels.
<p>The present economic and political situation creates an especially favorable
opportunity for the formation of a Labor Party, a form of independent political
action of the working class. The doubling of the socialist vote the last
election, 1930, have shown ways in which the masses have shown their desire
for such independent political action.
<p>30. A sharp attack is being launched against the Communists, accompanied
by a vigorous drive against the foreign born. The recommendations of the
Fish Committee have become the platform of the reactionaries. These recommendations
called for (among other things) (a) deportation of alien Communists, (b)
exclusion of immigrants, (c) suppression of Communist papers, (d) denial
of citizenship, (e) suppression of the Communist Party, (f) embargo on
Soviet goods, etc. The recommendations without even being passed by Congress
already are being carried out by the administration. Many anti-foreign-born
bills are pending in Congress. Wholesale raids and arrests by immigration
authorities are taking place (recent raid on Finnish workers&#8217; hall in New
York City; raid on Portuguese colony, Newark; on the Seamen&#8217;s Institute,
etc.) 100,000 foreign seamen are to be deported according to reports. All
immigration has been practically stopped. Terrorist tactics have greatly
increased. The Communist papers <em>"Young Pioneer,&#8221; &#8220;Young Worker,&#8221; &#8220;Revolutionary
Age,&#8221; &#8220;Vida Obrera,&#8221;</em> have already been denied mailing privileges. The
largest number of civil liberties cases since the war has been reported.
The number of Negro lynchings has more than doubled in one year (24 in
1930). A considerable number of Communists has been murdered (Lurio, Gonzalez,
Weitzenberg, Katovis, Wiggins), other Communists have been kidnapped and
beaten, still others given extremely long penitentiary sentences (Gastonia,
Imperial Valley). The Michigan cases are being revived. A whole series
of states are introducing and reinforcing their criminal syndicalist and
anarchist laws. A savage offensive against the Soviet Union has been launched.
Embargoes have been placed on Soviet pulpwood and timber. Plans are being
laid for the recall of American technicians now in the Soviet Union, etc.
The United States looms as the very antipode of the Soviet Union.
<p>31. The growing resistance to the present reactionary regime can be
clearly seen in the American colonies. Haiti, Nicaragua, Cuba, and the
Philippines are all scenes of actual revolt against the puppets of American
imperialism. Fearing more revolts, Secretary of State Stimson has been
compelled to state categorically that no recognition of de-facto governments
in the Caribbean countries would be granted by the U.S. The riots in Haiti,
and the election of an anti-American Haitian to leading office, the stiffening
Nicaraguan guerilla warfare, the tremendous general strikes and street
fighting in Cuba, the deep ferment in the Philippines (enormous street
demonstrations) and actual peasant revolts all show the sharpness of the
situation.
<p>Attempts have been made to pacify the colonies, e.g., the promise to
withdraw the marines from Nicaragua and Haiti, Hoover&#8217;s recent trip to
Puerto Rico, etc.,
<p>32. The strained political situation is also demonstrated in the war
preparations of the United States. We cannot stress too much the rapidly
growing danger of American imperialist war. Never before, in peace times,
were the naval, military appropriations so high, (1930&#8212;825 million dollars
appropriated, 1931&#8212;850 million dollars) never were so many men under
arms, (1930, 138,000 in regular army, 114,000 reserve officers, 183,000
National Guard) so large a fleet (15 new cruisers now being laid or completed)
so many soldiers in reserve organizations, so well-equipped a force, so
many new innovations introduced and experiments carried on, so thorough
an industrial survey and mobilization, so centralized a political machine.
The printed memoirs of Pershing are part of the steady stream of propaganda
accelerating this process.

<p>VII.-POTENTIALITIES FOR RADICALIZATION</center></p>

<p>33. Nowhere better than in the United states has the Marxian law of
capitalist accumulation&#8212;the greater the strength and energy of capitalism
the larger the unemployed and pauper armies&#8212;been demonstrated. The intense
capitalist rationalization since the war has meant the following: (a) the
workers of this country suffer the highest accident rate, the highest industrial
disease rate, of any country in the world. Vital statistics show a smaller
percentage of the population alive over 40 years of age than in any country.
(b) Here the relative wage is the lowest. While over 500 people paid income
taxes on incomes over one million dollars&#8212;a record&#8212;over 90% of the
people are poor (that is, below the government standards of decency in
income), (c) Nor have real wages actually advanced. Counteracting the reported
rise in real wages since the war are the increased wear and tear on the
worker, the chronic unemployment and part time work, the complete lack
of social insurance, the necessity to support &#8220;dependents&#8221; over 40 who
can no longer get work, etc.
<p>The living and social conditions of the workers have grown worse since
the war. The number of deaths is increasing faster than the number of births.
The rapid pace which the worker must keep up, coupled with the break down
of family life under capitalism has led to a great increase of nervous
disorders, cancer, etc. and to a big wave of suicides. The malnutrition
of the masses is well evidenced by the thousands of deaths yearly from
pellagra. In 1916, a &#8220;prosperous&#8221; year, 15% of the New York school children
were undernourished. Conservative estimates today would place the number
at 250,000 undernourished school children in New York City and 6,000,000
throughout the nation.
<p>34. The life-breaking pressure on the masses is further shown by the
tremendous growth of the crime rate. On the one hand this is an illustration
of rebellion by the masses. It is an anarchist method of striking back
at the exploiters and oppressors. (The &#8220;Baumes Law&#8221; is one method of reply
by the bourgeoisie.) On the other hand we must note that the bourgeoisie
is deliberately widening the net so as to entrap as many workers as possible.
The widespread application of the vagrancy laws, the method of enforcing
the Prohibition Amendment, etc. have sent literally millions of workers
to jail.
<p>Throughout the whole period of the war and since, the ruling classes
have exerted the greatest pressure to regiment and discipline the masses.
The system of forced labor has never been given up in America. Widespread
peonage still exists in the South. Mass arrests on charges of violation
of the vagrancy and prohibition laws provide an army of labor for the building
of roads, state construction work, manufacture of jute and cotton goods,
etc. The practice of farming out prisoners to plantations is carried on
throughout the country particularly in the South.
<p>The jailing of millions, besides securing an army of convict laborers,
is calculated to break the spirit of the toilers, particularly the youth,
to make them know their place. Besides, from this criminal element a potential
fascist army can be formed. The racketeers bred by the trusts, and the
gunmen and strike-breakers recruited by detective agencies for the large
corporations are legitimate fruits of this crop. Modern capitalism breeds
a desperate criminal type, potentially fascist, completely under the control
and bidding of the ruling classes.
<p>Finally, these wholesale arrests also enormously strengthen the power
of the ubiquitous state bureaucracy and corrupt political machines. This
bureaucracy exacts a heavy toll from the masses.
<p>The growth of the crime rate brings with it a dialectical movement that
aids the workers as well. The masses have become hardened. The corrupt
state becomes thoroughly exposed in their eyes as a class instrument. The
"Majesty of the Law&#8221; no longer means anything to them. They learn to hate
the capitalist state and politicians.
<p>35. The foregoing tendencies are no better illustrated than by the Prohibition
enforcement. The Prohibition Amendment is a direct attack upon the masses.
(a) it is an intensification of rationalization; (b) it means the augmentation
of the police and armed forces of the state and the entrenchment of the
bureaucracy; (c) it is an attack on the historic standard of living; (d)
it goes hand in hand with an attack on civil liberties; (e) it is one of
the ways to break up workers&#8217; organizations and strikes; (f) for the first
time we have the principal reply set into the Constitution of the United
States that the worker belongs to the employer, not only when he produces
but when he consumes, and that the worker in consuming is but caring for
the capitalist&#8217;s machine which he dares not damage.
<p>However, capitalism can not do away with alcoholism. Alcoholism is necessary
to besot the worker, to drug and to dope him. It is the physical companion
to religion. It is needed to make the worker forget his sufferings, to
get him to do dangerous jobs, and to cheat and swindle him. Besides it
is a prime necessity for the degenerate wealthy parasites and their counterpart,
the underworld.
<p>Prohibition enforcement too brings with it its own dialectical contradictions.
Therefore the fierce fight that is now going on between <em>wets</em> and
<em>drys</em>.
Respect for &#8220;law and order&#8221; is breaking down. The class character of the
state, the protection of the privileged classes, the cesspool of corruption
connected with the prohibition enforcement, become plain to the worker,
who, not drinking so much, can see and think more clearly. Prohibition
has helped to intensify the class struggle.
<p>36. The present economic crisis has greatly aggravated the sufferings
of the masses. Unemployment has rapidly risen to over 10 million with about
10 million more on part time work. In times of crisis we have not only
the number of floating, latent and stagnant sections of the unemployed
always with us (Marx) (to which are added the new armies of immigrants
and paupers) but part-time workers, adults newly come of working age, wives
and children, formerly dependent, now forced to seek work, discharged employees
in domestic and personal service, and ruined sections of the petty bourgeoisie
urban and rural-farmers).
<p>Generally in time of crisis the worker gets paid below the value of
his labor power. In 1930 while unemployment averaged 14% (near 20% at the
end of the year) payrolls fell 20% average. Drastic wage cuts are in the
order of the day. Average weekly wages in money fell 22% in the two years
1928-1930 according to the National Industrial Conference Board. At the
same time the cost of living fell but 4% in 1930 (average) below 1929,
thus really the cost of living rose for those who were fortunate to get
work. (Estimates of the fall of 5% in real wages have been given.)
<p>It has been shown that the unskilled poorest paid laborer is the worst
victim of wage cuts, speeding-up, lay-offs, and unemployment, but the skilled
too are feeling the pinch. The fall of real wages coming exactly at a time
when unemployment is rife, causes the greatest misery among the masses.
<p>The situation is even worse, if possible, among the agrarian masses.
Farm wages fell 25% in the South, 15% in the North and West. The wage level
of the laborer has reached that of 1916. So desperate have the farmers
become that actual seizures of food have taken place (Arkansas). The government
has been forced to promise &#8220;relief&#8221; to the farmers.
<p>The urban petty-bourgeoisie has also felt the weight of the crisis in
full force. Bankruptcies increased 35% in liabilities over the average
year in the 1923-1925 period. The largest bank crash in the history of
this country occurred in 1930 (Bank of U.S. with assets of one-quarter
billion dollars), radically affecting the assets of hundreds of thousands
of depositors. One thousand, one hundred bank failures occurred in 1930
involving three-quarter billion dollars. In 1929 there were only 600 involving
one-quarter billion dollars.
<p>According to R.G. Dun &amp; Co., 270 banks failed in the first quarter
of 1931 (involving 144 million dollars). In 1930, in the same period, 124
banks failed.
<p>37. All the capitalist agencies have shown themselves absolutely bankrupt
in the face of the crisis. Never was there so much downright lying handed
out as official statistics and forecasts. And indeed it is impossible for
the American capitalist government either to understand the crisis or to
give substantial relief to the starving masses. The Federal Grain Board
can give the farmers no remedy except to curtail production. By its operations
the grain speculators, the bankers and brokers have been greatly aided.
The Farm Seed and Drought Relief Acts are but a drop in the bucket and
will but flow into the coffers of the dealers and farm sharks.
<p>The government has obstinately rejected all social insurance schemes.
Instead it puts forth the theory of public works. Certainly the building
of more jails, armories, reformatories, etc., can only make things worse
for the workers. As for roads, dams and such increase of capital investment,
they but lay the base for still greater crises. Under the hands of the
corrupt political machines, the fund for public works becomes but an added
source of graft and plunder. Only a very small percent of it finds its
way as wages, and then in such a way as to be a club to batter down wages
and working conditions and to strengthen the crooks in office. The whole
myth of public works panacea becomes thoroughly exploded the moment the
bourgeoisie sees that the undue expenditures means an increase in the tax
rate.
<p>38. The great sharpening of the inner and outer contradictions of American
capitalism gives the basis for a tenseness of relationships, a restiveness
of the masses which can enable the Communists with a correct policy to
lead the masses into such activity as to radicalize them. There is a great
potentiality (not actually) of the masses becoming radicalized generally
and relatively quickly. The decisive factor is the policy of the Communists.
No other group can mobilize the masses for the coming struggles.
<p>The American Federation of Labor is steadily declining. Its base, the
United Mine Workers, has disintegrated to a great extent. Its principal
unions in the building trades have fallen down considerably. Its officials
have done yeoman service for the employers in the present crisis. They
agreed to an infamous anti-strike pact with the government, they have taken
the lead in the attacks on the Communists, on Russia, and on the foreign
born and immigrants. They have a damning record of recent strike betrayals
(Elizabeth, Marion, Danville, Philadelphia, etc.). They have most brazenly
put their whole weight to thwart any move for social insurance.
<p>Simultaneously in the present period the masses are moving to the left.
The great March 6th (1930) demonstrations, the food riots in Arkansas,
the opening up of a period of spontaneous strikes (Lawrence, Bridgeport),
and strikes carried on against the decisions of the A.F. of L. (Philadelphia,
Anthracite) show that the masses are getting into motion against the bourgeoisie.
Note also the Illinois new union movement.
<p>Ever since the war, the working class, now an army of 32 million, has
laid the basis for greater united effort than ever before. The composition
of the working class has become far more homogeneous than before. The gap
between skilled and unskilled has decreased as a result of capitalist rationalization.
The stoppage, restriction, and prohibition of immigration has greatly unified
the workers. The entrance into industry of millions of women (10 million)
and youth has greatly strengthened this movement. The youth particularly
have played a great leavening and cementing role. At the same time great
sections of the petty-bourgeoisie (farmers, store keepers, etc.) have become
proletarians. The large-scale migration of the Negroes to the North and
their deeper penetration into the ranks of the workers have tended to close
the gaps of the working class army and wield it into a monolithic whole.
<p>The movement to the left by the workers is calling into being an &#8220;opposition&#8221; movement in the A.F. of L. (Muste and the Conference for Progressive Labor
Action), and in the socialist party (the Stanley group). This movement
arises not as a symbol of the left wing but as a protective covering to
keep the masses from deserting these organizations. The Muste and Stanley
groups, as a whole, do not really wish to fight the Greens and the Hillquits.
They are quite willing to live in the old way. They do not wish to break
with the past. Their historic role is to serve as decoy ducks to enable
the A.F. of L. and the socialist party to continue to mislead workers moving
further and further to the left. The communists while free to unite with
them on certain issues must sharply attack them at all times.
<p>The great prospects for struggle that are opening up, the potentialities
that exist for widespread and sudden radicalization of the workers, have
not in the least been taken advantage of by the leadership of the official
Communist Party and the Lovestone and Cannon groups. Indeed, their crimes
and blunders are turning the workers away from the Communist movement.
The left wing in the A.F. of L. and other reactionary unions and worker
organizations has been annihilated. The new unions are in a state of chronic
collapse. Few achievements can be recorded. The unemployment movement has
been criminally handled. The Communist movement itself is disintegrating.
<center>
<p>VIII.-THE STRUGGLE FOR NEGRO EMANCIPATION</center></p>

<p>39. It has been truly said that the acid test for the Communist movement
is its policy and practice on the question of Negro emancipation. So much
addled nonsense has been written that it is necessary first of all to refute
the muddled theories that have misled the Communists of all groups.
<p>In the first place we must reject the line of reasoning of Pepper, never
repudiated by the Communist Party, to the effect that the South is a &#8220;colony&#8221; of American imperialism. This is but a resurrection of the long exploded
theory of infra-imperialism, that the South and the West are &#8220;colonies&#8221; of &#8220;Wall Street&#8221; etc. Such a theory has nothing to do with Leninism. The
South is one piece with the erst of the United States. It shares political
control. The industrialization of the South shows a complete capitalist
development is taking place, something no &#8220;colony&#8221; can show, except to
the theorists of &#8220;decolonization".
<p>Nor can one maintain that the &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; is a &#8220;colony". The &#8220;Black
Belt&#8221; is economically and politically indissolubly connected with a larger
area, the South. Each section of the &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; is part of its respective
state, with state traditions and customs. The &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; economically
is part of a cotton belt and cannot be treated separately. Besides, the
"Black Belt&#8221; has constantly shifted, from the North (Virginia) to the South
(Georgia) from the East (Georgia) to the West (Mississippi) and east again.
Now one region, now another, becomes part of the &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; (that is,
acquires a population the majority of which is Negro), or is relinquished.
<p>In the second place, we must reject the theory that the Negroes in the
U.S. comprise a nation in the full sense of the term. For a people to comprise
a nation there must be a common definite system of economic relationships
(primitive communism, slavery, feudalism, etc.) giving rise to a common
political and social system. Generally nations have had a land that they
had conquered or held from time immemorial and had become rooted to the
soil. From these relationships a common language, culture, customs, political
regime arise.
<p>This is the situation in Africa, and in the West Indies. It is not the
situation in the United States. Here the American Negroes have had no lasting
distinct language, culture, state. They were not rooted to the soil. They
had no separate territory, as conqueror or conquered. They were never feudal
peasants ingrained in the soil. Originally, the Negro was as much domestic
as agrarian. He was a slave, not a peasant, and did not live predominantly
in that part of the country which is now known as the &#8220;Black Belt". The
Spartacus flight of the Negro from the South via the &#8220;Underground Railway&#8221; route is part of the tradition that made the Negro feel the South was just
one vast prison.
<p>We must also categorically reject any &#8220;theory&#8221; that &#8220;proves&#8221; the Negro
"peasant&#8221; must be the mainstay of the movement. The line of the Communist
Party in this question (&#8221; &#8230; and the Negro peasantry, petty and middle-bourgeoisie
will be the driving force of this movement because it is a national revolutionary
movement,&#8221; (<em>The Communist</em>, March 1930)) is the same line in the
U.S. as that which led to the betrayal of the Chinese masses by the Comintern
in its deals with Chiang Kai Shek. Such a policy must be eliminated from
the Communist movement.
<p>First of all, today, of the eleven and one-half million Negroes, five
and one-half million are in cities and towns. These urban Negroes lead
the agrarian. Over two million are now in the North (partly as a result
of a steady migration from the South during and since the war). Second,
entirely contrary to the Stalinist-Pepper idea, the Negro farmers, almost
entirely tenants, are not tenants because they were once independent or
feudal peasants, owning their land, who were later reduced to tenancy.
In this respect the Negro tenant is entirely different from the European.
The Negro tenant is usually a laborer who has a &#8220;share-cropping tenant&#8221; status so that it will be easier to chain him to his labor and to prevent
his escape. It is a method to bind the laborer to the soil, not a step
in removing him from the soil. In Europe long-term tenants are the rule
in backward agrarian countries where a feudal peasant holdings have been
reduced to tenancy. In the U.S. the tenancy is for one year only. There
the peasant seldom moves. Here the Negro tenant is constantly on the go
(after his year tenancy expires). The Negro migration within the South
is greater than the migration of the Negro to the North!
<p>Furthermore of the total number of Negroes gainfully employed, less
than 40% are gainfully employed in agriculture, while the number working
in manufacturing and mechanical industries alone has risen to 30% of all
Negroes gainfully employed. Besides, of the Negro agrarians, at least 50%
or from one and one-half to two million are out-and-out agricultural laborers.
Share-cropping tenancy as a step removed from peonage is not a method to
proletarianize a peasantry but a method of binding the laborer.
<p>40. Although the American Negroes can not be considered as a nation
in the full sense of the term, living in a &#8220;colony,&#8221; nevertheless they
must be considered at present as a national minority. This was the opinion
of Lenin (Theses Second Congress) and Trotsky. The case of the American
Negro so far as his socio-political relations are concerned, is essentially
similar to that of the oppressed national minorities and colonial peoples
everywhere. In all such cases we see an effort to check the &#8220;normal&#8221; free
interplay of economic forces under capitalism, we see an effort, by force,
to prevent the sale of Negro labor power for example, at its value, or
to lower its value, or to try through the development of a caste system
to prevent the workings of capitalist laws so that the rulers may obtain
a super-profit. The economic remnants of slavery that are so strongly felt
in the South especially are but methods to secure these super-profits.
These methods were originated by capitalism itself.
<p>We must completely reject the anti-Leninist theories of the Lovestone
group that refuses to see that the American Negroes must be considered
as a national minority. If the American Negroes are not a nation in the
full sense of the word, certainly they once were a nation in that sense,
in Africa. If they have no common language today, certainly they have traditions
of common culture, language, customs, political and economic relationships,
etc. They have the common traditions of slavery, and it must be fully noted,
the tradition of having at one time, immediately after the Civil War, actually
administered state power in some of the Southern states. Further there
is such a thing as the &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; where the negro people predominate.
And finally they are discriminated against and oppressed as a group. They
have not been assimilated either in the South or in the North.
<p>42. Led by the nose by the false anti-Leninist theories of the present
leaders of the C.I., the leaders of the Communist Party have actually orientated
themselves on the Negro &#8220;peasants". The fight for national liberation of
the Negroes has been raised by the party as the central task. Leadership
is allotted to the Negro petty bourgeoisie. The American Negro Labor Congress
has been liquidated and a Negro &#8220;Civil Liberties Union&#8221; (League of Struggle
for Negro Rights!) has been substituted. Such a position is entirely alien
to Communism. It must be stamped out of the movement.
<p>The primary job of the Communists is to reach the Negro proletariat
and first of all, in the cities of the North. The principal slogan raised
must be COMPLETE EQUALITY FOR THE NEGRO. The main job, of course, is in
the South and there above all in the cities. The work in the countryside
must be centered on the Negro agricultural laborers. The theory that 800,000
Negro farmers in the South must be the basis of the movement must be completely
rejected.
<p>The Negro population of the U.S. lives in conditions of stark misery
and destitution that beggar description. Their death rate is double that
of the whites. In the factory they are discriminated against, getting everywhere
much lower pay than the white workers. They are the last to be hired and
the first to be fired. Many A.F. of L. unions bar the Negro worker. Among
Negro women, nearly one-half the married women work, as compared with 20%
among the white women. Their living conditions are on the lowest possible
level. They are crowded in segregated slum districts, nearly always near
if not identical with the vice sections of the cities. The extraordinary
high crime rate among Negroes speaks at once of their worse conditions,
of their rebellious spirit and of the especial hounding of the Negroes
by the police. Without political rights, Jim-crowed, persecuted and despised,
the Negroes stand truly as a <em>pariah</em> caste in America.
<p>The Leninist slogan of self-determination for the Negroes must be raised
as a supplementary one, working hand in hand with the principal slogan
<em>Complete
Equality for the Negro</em>. Such a policy helps to guarantee that such
complete equality will be carried out. This policy awakens the rural Negro.
It will raise the fighting spirit of the Negroes. We must guard against
the slogan Self Determination and National Liberation for the Negro being
counterposed <em>against</em> the slogan of complete equality. It must not
become a slogan &#8220;Back to the South.&#8221; <p>When properly used the slogan of self-determination for the American
Negroes becomes the best weapon to smash the reactionary and utopian Garvey
"Back to Africa&#8221; movement. On the other hand this demand of the Negroes
in the United States will cause the Negroes all over the world (Liberia,
Haiti, South Africa, West Indies, etc.) to wage their struggle for independence
even more sharply than before. (The attempt of the Cannon group to declare
the Negroes of even these other countries must not fight for national liberation
must be branded as an out-and-out white chauvinist, Menshevist view).
<p>41. In all united fronts the Communists make on the question of national
liberation of the Negroes, the Communists must fight for proletarian hegemony
of the movement. Only Stalinites with their infamous Chiang Kai Shek traditions
can propose that the peasantry or petty-bourgeoisie take the leadership.
The Communist Party Stalinites have raised the theory that since the movement
is a national liberation one, <em>therefore</em>, the proletariat cannot
lead.
<p>Such a theory is false to the roots. It lays the basis for the complete
betrayal of the proletariat and the Negro masses. It is true that the civil
war did not complete the bourgeoisie-democratic revolution in the South
(not because the Negro slaves did not get the land, the plantations broken
up into small farms&#8212;that is not the basic test&#8212;but because the continued
treatment of the Negroes as a national minority were remnants of pre-capitalist
times, modifying the &#8220;classic&#8221; workings of capitalism. But the Russian
revolution has demonstrated that <em>Only The Proletariat can Complete The
Bourgeois Democratic Revolution.</em>
<p>Certainly national liberation of the Negroes can not be effected outside
of the proletarian revolution in the United States. This is a policy that
moves the entire Negro masses to support the proletariat. Within the Negro
liberation movement the proletariat must take the helm from the petty-bourgeoisie
and boldly announce its own interests. Its interests are ultimately for
a Soviet Republic. The Communists must fight for the eventual formation
of a Negro Soviet Republic as part of the Soviet Republic of the United
States and of the World Soviet Republic.
<p>42. The recent reports to the U.S. Senate on Indian affairs reveals
the truly deplorable conditions among the American Indians. American imperialism
has almost annihilated this people. The Communists must fight for the unconditional
national liberation of the American Indians.
<center>
<p>IX.-THE DEGENERATION OF THE COMINTERN SINCE THE DEATH OF LENIN</center></p>

<p>43. The Comintern today is in a profound crisis. The narrowing down
and great loss of prestige of the C.I. leadership, the weakening of the
sections of the C.I. and mass expulsions show how deeply opportunism was
part of the Communist movement. The formation of three different separately
organized international Communist groups speaks of the disintegration of
the movement. But it also marks a step forward, since such a situation
exposes the rottenness in many national groups, hardens the real Leninists,
and prepares the way for new advances.
<p>We owe it primarily and above all to L.D. Trotsky for exposing the situation
since Lenin died, for bringing to light the testament of Lenin which the
other leaders had deliberately hidden, and for uncovering many facts of
Party history concealed by the bureaucrats from the membership.
<p>The steady degeneration of the C.I. since Lenin&#8217;s death is best illustrated
(a) by the theory of building socialism in one country and the national
socialist tendencies flowing from this theory. (b) by the objective protection
given enemies of the working class (Chiang Kai Shek, reactionary British
Trade Union General Council). (c) by the suppression of Lenin&#8217;s writings.
(d) by the &#8220;rude and disloyal&#8221; internal regime. (e) by the generation of
Thermidorean elements within the Soviet Union and the strengthening of
bureaucracy.
<p>The theory of building socialism in one country discredits the very
idea of socialism, discredits the proletariat. It leads to the greatest
contempt for other Communist Parties. It springs from a belief that the
international revolution is far away. It tends to glorify the peasantry.
It casts false illusions concerning the self-sufficiency of the Soviet
Union on the international working class.
<p>The Stalinist (also Bucharinist) theory of building &#8220;socialism&#8221; in one
country alone leads directly to the coarsest Menshevist national socialist
view. Diplomatic state intrigues replace frank proletarian international
policies (the signing of the Kellogg Peace Pact, the profuse apologies
for &#8220;dumping&#8221; etc.). The Five Year Plan is counter-posed to the international
revolution. These bureaucrats sow the suspicion that there would be the
greatest reluctance if not down right refusal on their part to aid revolutionary
outbreaks in Europe by the armed forces of the Workers Fatherland. Now
more than ever the Red Army must be sensitive to the demands of the international
revolution. The mere suspicion of a delay might make the difference between
success or defeat or might spell disaster.
<p>Since 1924 the C.I. leadership has deliberately hidden the writings
of Lenin (of the 30 complete volumes of Lenin&#8217;s works, only 4 have been
published in English after 13 years!). The advice of Lenin for the removal
of Stalin has been suppressed. (Not for the first time did these &#8220;Leninists&#8221; suppress Lenin&#8217;s writings&#8212;note the early days of the February Revolution.)
The degenerate C.I. regime has deliberately prevented the international
working class from absorbing the invaluably precious writings of V.I. Lenin.
<p>Since the Fourth C.I. Congress the robotization of the Communist Parties
and puppetization of the leaderships have steadily increased. There can
be no question but the next war will find the Stalinized leaderships disgracing
themselves.
<p>44. In the United States precisely at a time when the subjective factor
is so decisive and in a country where the responsibility is so heavy, the
disintegration of the C.P. has exposed three groups with definite right
wing tendencies. These tendencies must be cleaned out of the Communist
movement.
<p>From the very beginning the Communist movement in the U.S. met severe
obstacles both objective and subjective. The principle objective difficulties
were due (a) to the retarded domination of the capitalist mode of production
(frontier, free land, etc.), and the uneven development of capitalism;
(b) the unchecked capitalist advance and the exceptional opportunities
for advancement before the ware, leading to a large petty-bourgeoisie,
relatively better conditions for the proletariat, a huge wave of immigration
disuniting the workers and retarding the growth of class consciousness;
(c) to the shift of economic center of gravity since the war with its concomitant
huge growth of American imperialism, parasitic rentier class, and corruption
of a section of the upper layers of the proletariat.
<p>The obstacles inherent in the Communist movement in this country are
mainly (a) remnants of social democracy (parliamentarism, legalism, lack
of direct action, pacifism, nationalism, national socialism, democratic
illusions, belief in ultra-imperialism (organized capitalism), contempt
for agrarian, colonial, anti-military, Negro, etc.; work, loose party organization
and false organizational structure); (b) remnants of A.F. of L.ism (bureaucracy,
orientation to skilled workers, class-collaboration theories and practices,
contempt for unorganized and impoverished masses, etc.); (c) remnants of
anarchism (individualism, individual terror, minority action, putchism,
false theory of the state, etc.); (d) remnants of syndicalism (fusion of
roles of union and of political party, anti-political, anti-election participation
attitude, false understanding of role of industrial unions, failure to
work within reactionary organization, to mobilize all oppressed sections
of the population, false views on organization questions and the relationship
of leaders to members within working class organizations, etc.)
<p>To these obstacles must be added the special ones that arose from the
poor social composition of the Communist movements, the division of the
Party into foreign-language federations, entirely isolated from the American
proletariat, each leading its own separate nationalist existence.
<p>45. There has never been a genuine Community Party in this country.
The Lovestone-Foster-Cannon joint leadership (up to 1928) drove the movement
into non-Leninist channels, especially after the death of Comrade C.E.
Ruthenberg. The major failures of this joint unprincipled leadership may
be classified under two heads: (a) failure to separate the Party from the
class; (b) failure to build a party or to root it among the workers.
<p>The failure to separate the Party from the class, to make it truly a
"vanguard&#8221; and &#8220;general staff&#8221; organization was evident on every side (a)
in the absence of Marxist theory (lack of adequate research, failure to
teach in any adequate manner the basic economic works of Marx&#8212;Vol. I
to III of Capital, etc.)&#8212;failure to translate many important volumes
of Marx&#8217; and Engel&#8217;s works, failure to put forth any original serious theoretical
work, failure to train a broad cadre of theoretical leaders; (b) vulgar
Marxism (e.g., national socialist tenancies, theory of American exceptionalism
(Lovestone) of bourgeoisification of working class (Foster-Cannon, et al);
(c) existence of foreign federationism; (d) lack of tests for membership;
(e) degenerate leadership, never tested in any struggle as Communists,
rotten with careerism, factionalism, petty bourgeois diplomacy, subsidy
corruption and bureaucracy. We must clean this pus out of the Communist
movement.
<p>Similarly we must stress the complete failure under the joint Foster-Lovestone-Cannon
leadership to build an organization that could be called a PARTY or to
root it among the masses. For a long time no concrete mass work was done,
the &#8220;party&#8221; being an agglomeration of 18 foreign-language federations utterly
isolated from the masses. These foreign federations pushed forward only
those leaders who did not wish to fight, who would allow the federations
to stagnate as they were. When concrete work was attempted only the skilled
workers in the A.F. of L. were touched. (The main slogan was &#8220;Amalgamation
or Annihilation.") The sole method used was that of maneuvers and tricks
with A.F. of L. fakers from the top. In the political field an orientation
to the farmers (well-to-do farmers at that) took place. No effort was made
to organize the unorganized. Indeed the organization of the unorganized
was denounced on principle. There never was even seriously attempted anti-imperialist
work, anti-militarist work, Negro work, work in the South, etc. For four
years the leaders sabotaged the C.I. theses of Lenin on organization. To
the very end (1928) shop nuclei were mostly on paper. Within the Party
the most rampant fakery, lying, dishonesty, were the normal everyday methods
of leadership.
<p>46. The driving out of the Lovestone and Cannon misleaders from the
C.P.U.S.A. did not change its essential character. Today as before, the
C.P.U.S.A. is essentially a right wing Communist organization (though some
of its phrases and forms appear leftist). The mountain of opportunism in
the C.P. can be seen in every major part of its work. We mention only some
of the more recent outstanding examples: (a) estimation of the crisis as
a cyclical one; (b) theory that internationally the crisis was the basic
final collapse of capitalism; (c) theory that American imperialism was
on the downgrade; (d) theory that the masses were actually radicalized
all over the country, counter-attacking the bourgeoisie; (e) anti-Marxist
Proudhonist slogan &#8220;Work or Wages"; (f) opportunist method of propagating
the social insurance bill; (g) apologetic attitude on question of Soviet
Union underselling capitalist world (so-called &#8220;dumping"); (h) failure
to building unemployment organization (failure to develop non-party workers,
to establish workers&#8217; democracy), to build unemployed block councils according
to plan, to hold demonstrations in workers&#8217; quarters, to lay the basis
for &#8220;food riots,&#8221; desperate tenant eviction battles, etc., to establish
mobilization points in the workers&#8217; quarters, failure to map out an adequate
program of &#8220;self-help&#8221; for the unemployed. Instead, there were criminally
futile methods of demonstrations solely before City Halls, and open parks
far removed from workers, placing the workers in traps with consequent
isolation of unemployed from employed, of the vanguard from the army, etc.;
(i) actual gross overestimation of the enemy (theory that all forces in
opposition are now one reactionary mass; theory that the A.F. of L. is
"outright fascist"; &#8220;new&#8221; theory of social-fascism, etc.); (j) collapse
of new unions (miners, textile, marine, shop, etc.); (k) capitulation to
A.F. of L. fakers, refusal of Communist Party to enter strikes (Marion,
Danville, etc.); (l) abandonment of mass reactionary unions; (m) criminal
handling of Gastonia defense and subsequent attack on Gastonia defendants;
(n) abandonment of any real work in the South; (o) kulak agrarian program
(advice to farmers to curtail production&#8212;<em>Daily Worker</em>, editorial
Aug. 7th, 1930); (p) abandonment of united front tactic (or when infrequently
adopted carried out in an opportunist manner, e.g., anti-religious united
front with bourgeois Atheist society but not with labor groups meeting
on greeting Soviet fliers, etc.); (q) abandonment of Labor Party slogan;
(r) out-and-out petty-bourgeois anti-Marxist line in Negro work (theory
driving force must be Negro petty-bourgeoisie and peasants, dropping of
any mention of Negro proletariat and its role in the League of Struggle
for Negro Rights, the anti-Marxist theory of building organizations for
"Rights,&#8221; failure of Communists to take independent position in this national
Negro united front; (s) petty-bourgeois demands and methods of mobilizing
bank depositors; (t) theory that those expelled for adhering to the Cannon,
Lovestone or other Communist groups are counter-revolutionists to be physically
annihilated; (u) breaking up of workers&#8217; meetings; (v) reign of terror
inside the Party; (w) failure to test leadership of the party in struggle;
(x) perpetration of ills of the past (factionlism, bureaucracy, fakery,
no shop nuclei, etc.); (y) use of frame-up method (expulsion of Weisbord,
Pollack, and others from the Party) etc.
<p>47. The Lovestone leadership has been well fitted by its past to move
further and further to the right. Inside of its ranks is a section openly
moving to the socialist party. The basic right wing errors of the Lovestone
Group are as follows: (a) national socialism (failure to see the mutual
dependence of America and the rest of the world-declining imperialism,
refusal to abide by international discipline, etc.); (b) grossly exaggerated
estimation of strength of American imperialism (theory of exceptionalism,
theory of South as a reservoir of reaction, etc.); (c) theory that present
U.S. crisis is a cyclical one (since it will be over &#8220;in two years&#8221; and
the U.S. will &#8220;reach new peaks"); (d) theory that international capitalism
will grow stronger and revolutions will be crushed (since only in this
way could the U.S. reach &#8220;new peaks&#8221; soon); (e) tendency to see only the
strength of the enemy ("Fascism on the Rampage&#8221; &#8220;Reaction at the Helm&#8221; etc.)&#8217; (f) petty-bourgeois unemployment slogan &#8220;Don&#8217;t pay now"; (g) theory
world economic crisis (is) but a &#8220;depression"; (h) denial of possibility
of radicalizing the masses&#8212;theory that American workers are &#8220;docile";
(i) orientation solely to the A.F. of L.; (j) liquidatory attempts on new
unions (textile, needle); (k) blank denial of any necessity ever to split
from the A.F. of L.; (l) grossly opportunist methods of united front (e.g.,
with Levy) in which the Lovestoneites fail to attack prominent labor fakers
and betrayers; (m) treacherous alliance with Muste group&#8212;stating that
the principles of the Muste group are acceptable to the Communists (n)
false estimation of the Stanley&#8212;S.P. group as &#8220;militant,&#8221; &#8220;left wing";
(o) treacherous Indian program (principal slogan at one time &#8220;Free Gandhi,&#8221; failure to sharply attack Indian bourgeoisie, etc.); (p) anti-Leninist
Negro position that we must not fight for the national liberation of the
American Negroes; (q) failure to test the leadership in any concrete struggles
as Communists; (r) recent change in organization, with trade union fractions
in place of shop nuclei; (s) downright theoretical political dishonesty
- the Resolution on Trotskyism and failure to state whether Trotsky should
have been expelled, failure to state their own errors in the expulsion
of Trotsky, dishonest covering up of their theory of socialism in one country,
etc.
<p>48. It is impossible to declare that one group (Lovestone) is more to
the right than the other (official Party). We must not be fooled by the
make-believe &#8220;left&#8221; phrases of the Party bureaucrats. The fact is both
groups have the same basic history of criminal mishandling of the Party
and the same general program (theory of building socialism in one country,
national socialism, Chiang Kai Shek adventures, theory of cyclical crisis,
corrupt factional leadership, etc.). Both are right wing groups essentially,
differing only in the form and tempo of development of their opportunism.
<p>49. In spite of its adherence to the International Left Opposition the
Cannon group in the United States is a very plain right-wing sectarian
group. It is but a factional remnant of the old Cannon group in the Party
using the name of L.D. Trotsky as a mask. The very adherence of the Cannon
leadership to the International Left Opposition headed by Trotsky shows
its brazen unprincipledness.
<p>The whole history of the Cannon group leadership makes it entirely unfit
to carry out the principles of the International Left Opposition in this
country. (a) the Cannon faction was an ardent supporter of the &#8220;apex theory";
(b) Cannon&#8217;s theory of &#8220;deep-going radicalization&#8221; of the masses in the
U.S.&#8212;see Platform of 1929; (c) the theory that the vote for Al Smith
showed this deep-seated radicalization; (d) the theory that the farmers
must lead the Labor Party movement; (e) Cannon was the first to make an
alliance with Pepper&#8212;1923; (f) he was the first to unite with Lovestone
against Trotsky (1925). (As a member of the Polcom he was in a position
to know true facts at the time); (g) the Cannon leadership was violently
opposed to the organization of the unorganized (Passaic strike 1926); (h)
they were the originators of the unprincipled &#8220;faction to end factions&#8221; - 1927; (i) worked hand in hand with other cliques in criminally mishandling
the party; (j) participated in actual betrayal of the New Bedford strike,
1928 as heads of the I.L.D. in approving the actions of the I.L.D. district
representatives, actually sending the two principal leaders to jail at
a critical moment of the strike!
<p>The Cannon group has since amply shown its open right wing character:
(a) propagation of the view that Trotsky desires only a propaganda society
in the U.S.; (b) failure to print a single agitational leaflet in over
two years of existence; (c) throwing all energies into building up of a
publishing business; (d) tacit united front with anti-Marxist Max Eastman;
(e) unprincipled united front with former Cannonites ("Bill&#8221; Dunne and
Co.) still in the party; (f) pessimistic perspective of struggle in the
U.S. and belief that only propaganda is necessary today&#8212;absolute refusal
to engage in mass work or in united fronts; (g) theoretical bankruptcy
on important questions not touched by Trotsky (vacillating attitude on
Labor Party, wait of full year before printing any kind of unemployment
program, barrenness on Negro question, etc); (h) Menshevist position that
the Negroes must not fight for self-determination even in South Africa;
(i) Anti-revolutionary view, Chinese peasant revolution does not exist;
(j) against Chinese peasant guerilla warfare and failure to see rise of
Chinese revolution; (k) false position on unemployment, orientating on
the employed (30-hour week as central slogan) rather than the unemployed;
(l) liquidatory attitude towards new unions (needle trades article by Cannon,
Sept. 15, 1930); (m) against Communists joining the National Revolutionary
Congress in India on united front basis; (n) protection of anarchists arrested
by GPU in Russia for counter-revolutionary activity (under demand: We want
proof whether the anarchists had a fair trial!); (o) refusal to test leadership
in struggle; (p) loose organizational structure; (q) unregenerate lack
of self-criticism.
<p>The sole value of the Cannon group is that it has published the writings
of L.D. Trotsky in this country.
<p>50. In regard to the utterly corrupt leadership of all three right wing
groups our position must be to eliminate them entirely from all influence
in the Communist ranks. In regard to the groups themselves, since they
are after all Communist groups, we must fight that the members of all groups
be readmitted into one Communist Party, not as groups but as individuals.
The Communist League of Struggle, however, can never abandon its grouping
until the right wing policies of all these groups are defeated and a Leninist
line carried out. Only in this way can there be reconstituted an International
of Lenin. Only in this way can the advanced workers be won over to a Leninist
conception of Party democracy and a broad line drawn between the Communist
movement as a whole and the Mensheviks.
<p>In the meantime the Communist League of Struggle must try to effect
a united front so that all Communist groups can work together on concrete
issues on the basis of the recognition of the Communist character of each
group. This will also help to re-establish mass work, to resist the violent
tactics of the party officialdom, and to place the Communist groups on
a correct path. The danger is that the line between Menshevism and Communism
will become so blurred, due to the right-wing tactics of the Party, Lovestone
and Cannon groups as to set back the whole revolutionary movement.
<p>51. With the death of Lenin there has come a degeneration of C.I. leadership.
To reconstitute a Leninist International the following organizational principles
must be effected (a) the closest working together of all Communist groups
as against their class enemies; (b) the sharpest ideological intransigence;
(c) the firm establishment of those principles insuring the greatest inner
party democracy (possible under the given circumstances) and the utmost
development of initiative and ability from below; (d) the recognition and
carrying out of the Leninist theory of the process of creation of leaders.
The absolute prerequisite for leadership, particularly in a legal party,
must be the ability to carry on concrete mass work in a revolutionary manner.
To this must be added correct and profound Marxian understanding, absolute
honesty and courage. Only with such leaders can the working class be successful
in its revolutionary struggles.
<p>On this basis the above-mentioned American Communist groups as they
now exist, must be declared woefully deficient and only the sharpest struggle
for the above principles will be able to prevent the degeneration of these
groups and to create the necessary organization of the vanguard of the
proletariat for victory.

<p>X.-THE TASKS OF THE COMMUNIST LEAGUE OF STRUGGLE</center></p>

<p>52. The sharpening of all contradictions and antagonisms throughout
the world and the dominant role of America in the capitalist world places
extra-ordinarily heavy responsibilities upon the Communists in this country.
Basing itself firmly upon the teachings of Marx and Lenin, especially as
embodied in the theses of the first four Congresses of the C.I., and following
the correct political line of the present theses, the Communist League
of Struggle must make as its basic task the winning of the working masses
for independent working class action and for Communism.
<p>53. The very sharpening of the situation makes all the more imperative
the vigorous application of the united tactic by the Communists. The united
front is a vital necessity for the workers. By means of the united front
the Communists can come to grips with the class enemies rooted inside the
ranks of the workers. It enables the Communists to reach and to win the
masses. Finally, the united front tactic is a method by which the Communists&#8217;
character is rounded out, their ability, revolutionary science and integrity
are put to the test. In all united fronts the Communists must constantly
act independently and, by enunciating boldly their own program, must strive
to win the masses to their side away from the control of their temporary
allies.
<p>54. The Communists, at this time especially, must not drop the slogan
of a Labor Party. This slogan was approved by the Comintern during the
time of Lenin. It is still correct to view the Labor Party as a most important
form of the united front (really as an integrated series of united fronts).
The present political situation makes it not unlikely (though the formation
of a Labor Party is not inevitable) that it will soon again be an important
issue before the workers.
<p>55. The unemployment campaign must be the central campaign of the Communists
among the masses.
<p>The proletarian quarter must be the base of the unemployment movement.
(Here is the best place to stage demonstrations, to connect the employed
with the unemployed, to draw in the widest strata of the masses.) The program
of the unemployed councils must have for its major immediate objective
the seizure of the necessaries of life; it must be based on getting food
and shelter for the jobless. The formation of Tenant Leagues, putting up
the most desperate resistance of every kind to every eviction that takes
place must be effected on a wide scale. Here we must learn from the experiences
in the Passaic, New Bedford, coal mine, and Gastonia strikes. In every
section food mobilization points must be set up where a good dish of food
can be sold at cost, where masses can be mobilized, where &#8220;contributions&#8221; from stores can be obtained, where a movement for extension of credits
can be supported, where the color line can most effectively be wiped out.
<p>The immediate program must be non-payment of rent, resistance to evictions,
reduction of the cost of living, extension of credits by food shops to
those unemployed, seizure of food, fight for social insurance. The unemployment
movement must be closely bound up with the movement for resistance to wage
cuts and worsened conditions and for the shorter work day.
<p>The widest united front movement must be created in order to mobilize
the broadest masses. The unemployment movement must help in the organization
of the unorganized and in the creation of a strong left wing to win the
workers in the reactionary unions to a militant policy.
<p>56. The trade union work must remain a most important part of the Communists&#8217;
work. The principal job is the organization of the unorganized, the building
up of a strong revolutionary trade union movement where none existed before.
Only the Communists have the capacity to organize the masses of unskilled
and to hold them in new unions. These new unions must be saved from the
destructive tactics of the C.P. bureaucracy. More than any other group,
the Communist League of Struggle, by the past of its membership, has founded
and built up the new union movement.
<p>At the same time it is necessary to intensify work in the reactionary
unions, to build again a left wing to struggle against the fakers and Muste
"progressives&#8221; who have misled the workers.
<p>This trade union work must be linked up with the general struggle of
the Communists against rationalization and for complete social insurance
and the shorter work day.
<p>57. The struggle against the menace of another imperialist war and the
campaign for the unconditional defense of the Soviet Union must be intensified.
These struggles must be conducted on the most concrete basis. These campaigns
must interpenetrate all the other campaigns of the Communists. Large direct
aid must be given the revolutionary colonial masses struggling against
American imperialism. Serious anti-military work must be begun. The Communists
must be thoroughly prepared to meet the onrush of the coming imperialist
war.
<p>58. The Communist League of Struggle adheres to the basic principles
of the International Left Opposition. It must fight for a thorough cleansing
and purging of the ranks of the Communists from top to bottom. It fights
for the readmission of the International Left Opposition into the Comintern
and for the reinstatement of Comrade Trotsky and his colleagues into rightful
posts of leadership.
<p>Forward in the struggle for Leninism! For an international Communist
movement and an American section that will not disgrace itself!
