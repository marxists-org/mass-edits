<p><font size=+2>Down With the Company Union and the Bosses&#8217; Lies and Hypocrisy</font>
<p><b><font size=+1>COOKED-UP COMPANY UNIONS&#8212;TAKE A LOOK AT &#8216;EM</font></b></center></p>

<p>This is the time for the workers of Passaic to consider the company
union hokum as dished out by Mr. Reinhold of the Forstmann and Huffmann
Co. For several years before the strike began the &#8220;representative assembly&#8221; applesauce had been swallowed by some of the workers of F and H. It had
been so well disguised that the average worker simply did not know what
he was getting.
<p>When first introduced with fine phrases and lovely declarations of welfare
and good faith some workers were inclined to take the bunk union and its
face value. But latter when it produced nothing tangible for the workers,
when the &#8220;representatives&#8221; turned into nothing but company succors, most
of the workers began to see through it. They have been seeing it more clearly
ever since&#8212;especially since the days when its dupes addressed a letter
to Mr. Forstmann asking that he kindly permit them to slave for him and
give them the necessary protection to scab! Little Tsar Nemo of Riot Act
fame was Mr. Forstmanns answer to his faithful company union scabs. The
veil was stripped completely off the &#8220;industrial democracy&#8221; professions
of the F and H. Since then real meaning of the &#8220;representative assembly&#8221; has been as clear as daylight.
<p>It is interesting to note what certain impartial economists and students
who have studied the company unions say about them.
<p>In his book &#8220;Economics for Citizenship&#8221; W. D. Moriarity, professor of
Economics and Business Administration at the University of Washington,
writes that &#8220;many employers want to isolate their men from the American
Federation of Labor&#8221; and to keep them out of the labor movement. How do
they do it? Let the professor tell us:&nbsp; &#8220;They instituted in one form
or another shop committees.&#8221; <p>Just like Forstmann&#8217;s &#8220;representative assembly".
<p>What is the result? Prof. Moriarity tells us the result: &#8220;It gets rid
of outside representatives of the national union and isolates the men in
each shop from organized consultation or at least from representation at
the conferences of each outside forces.&#8221; <p>What in plain English means that where the company union committees
get started the real union committees are prevented from entering the factory.
<p>Prof. Moriarity goes farther and explains that the company run shop
committees have been used by the bosses &#8220;to get more and more control over
labor.&#8221; <p>What are the functions of the dummy type of company unions such as they
have at F. and H.? Let the professor explain again: &#8220;The shop committee
is often made into a &#8216;rubber stamp&#8217; committee to meet and listen to suggestions
of a smooth welfare worker or some efficiency expert who must get the &#8230;&#8230;..
cooperation of the men to put through planes that have been determined
on (by the bosses). Sometimes too, its just a rubber stamp to satisfy the
men that they are having something to say about things.&#8221; <p>A RUBBER STAMP&#8212;not a real workers union committee&#8212;is what millionaire
Forstmann wants in his mills. His &#8220;representative assembly&#8221; is the ideal
RUBBER STAMP.
<p>We workers must decide whether we want to have rubber stamp committees
or labor union committees. The first kind will serve Mr. Hoffman the second
kind will serve us.
<p>There are lots of other well-known economic writers who have discovered
the tricks in the company union. Let us quote just one more. Mr. Earl J.
Miller of the University of Illinois: &#8220;Many of the councils (company unions)
are organized either to avoid dealing with existing unions or to prevent
the union organization getting a foothold among the men.&#8221; <p>Which means that Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Reinhold have one end in view
when they introduced the succor&#8217;s union&#8212;to head off and prevent REAL
ORGANIZATION IN REAL UNIONS.

<p><b><font size=+2>Citizens Stage Monster Parade In Support of Passaic
Strikers</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Whole Population Turns Out To Back The Fighting Textile
Workers</font></b></center></p>

<p>The vitality of the textile strike which is now in its eighteenth week
was shown by the monster demonstration held in support of the strikers
Sunday afternoon by the associated societies and Perishes of Passaic and
vicinity that have come out openly for the workers in which over 20,000
took active part and another 30,000 lined the walks and crowded roofs and
windows along the line of march.
<p>It was the greatest demonstration ever held in Passaic and it was a
demonstration that could never have been held without the tremendous power
of the textile workers under the leadership of the united front committee
in its organizer Albert Weisbord.
<p>The march started at 2:30 in the afternoon and it took over two hours
for line to pass. Several brass bands gave their services and a mile of
automobiles gave evidence of the far reaching sympathy the strikers have
created.
<p>the Parade passed by the forest amend and Huffman mills and marched
by the mansions of Julius Forstmann and Col. Johnson, the two bitterest
enemies of the workers in the present conflict. It wild up in the first
Ward Park where an estimated mass of people of over 35,000 cheered a dozen
speakers mostly priests, who drew tremendous enthusiasm when they told
the vast gathering that the workers must never go back to work until they
can grow as a union
<p>Among the speakers was Rev. John Wroblewsky, who has spoken often before
the strikers and who has always urged them to stand by the united front
committee and their leader Weisbord. He gave the same advice on Sunday
and was loudly applauded and cheered.
<p>Following are sentences by different speakers: &#8220;We don&#8217;t want a company
union"; &#8220;Don&#8217;t go back till you have your own union"; &#8220;The mill owners
drive the workers to organize"; &#8220;We must teach you not only the English
language here in America but we must teach you that you must have a union";
"We have no time to live after the men work days and the women work nights
in the mills"; &#8220;The bosses have everything while we have nothing&#8217;; &#8220;If
you get your union you get your mills swept and kept clean if you do not
get your union you will be in the same bad way as before"; &#8220;Do not listen
to anybody except the LEADERS OF YOUR UNION"; &#8220;We want to work but we also
want something for our work so we can live like decent Americans; when
we get together we can win; the union must be permanent and all must belong
to the union and it must always be the union of the workers; that a union
be as strong as this Parade; and so on. These are sentences uttered by
the priests.
<p>G. K&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; editor of Catholic &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. told the crowd that &#8220;you
could not go to Sen. Edge or Edwards with your troubles. They are with
the mill owners. You must have a political party of your own and elect
workers, not lackeys of the bosses. Your &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. will be helpless unless
you have political power to back it.&#8221; <p>And the vast masses went wild with enthusiasm. The strikers&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.
<center>
<p><b><font size=+2>"Common Decency&#8221;</font></b></center></p>

<p>The bosses say that &#8220;common decency precludes any compromise with those
who are responsible for the flood of civic and oral poison that has been
poured into this community from &#8216;strike headquarters.&#8217;&#8221; <p>If the bosses have any sense of decency they would avoid the word as
they would avoid fire.
<p>For when it comes to decency, the mill barons have little to boast of.
<p>Is it decent to pay your workers as low as $10 and $12 a week?
<p>Is it decent to put women to work nights, to put pregnant women to work
nights, because their necessity compels them to slave for you at lower
wages than other workers?
<p>Is it decent to discharge your workers when they come to you and ask
for the abolition of the wage cuts?
<p>Is it decent of you bosses to create such poverty that you are afraid
to let congress investigate the conditions in the mills and in the city?
<p>Is it decent of you to have such filthy conditions in the mills that
workers faint from the smell of it?
<p>Is it decent to pay your workers so little that they cannot buy milk
for their babies?
<p>Is it decent to keep living conditions so low that the death rate becomes
50% higher in your community than in any other part of the state of New
Jersey?
<p>Is it decent of you to pay the sheriff and gunmen to beat down the strikers
whom you now try to coax back to your hell holes to renew their slavery?
<p>Is it decent to command your mayors and police to club the workers when
they ask for a chance to live?
<p>Is it decent to throw gas bombs, and to turn the water hose on the workers
in sub-zero weather?
<p>Is it decent of you to close up our halls and institute a reign of terror
that shames civilization?
<p>Is it decent of you to refuse to talk the matter over with your workers
when prominent men and women such as led the Parade Sunday beg of you to
do your share in settling the strike?
<p>We the workers have been decent at all times.
<p>We have asked the most reasonable terms from you and have been ready
to settle the strike at all times. We have invited the most through investigation
of our work and asked that congress or any other agency find out for itself
what we are doing and what we are asking.
<p>Priests and bishops have been at our meetings and participated with
us in our work or organization. They all report that we are asking only
the fair thing.
<p>The city council of Garfield has endorsed our demands. Prominent committees
have endorsed our demands. The entire working class have endorsed our demands.
<p>Forty-seven societies and churches have endorsed our demands.
<p>The greatest demonstration in the history of the textile mill territory
led by respected and reputable men in which sixty thousand of our citizens
took part endorsed our demands.
<p>All of these think that the United Front Committee and the strikers
are decent. Their sense of decency is not outraged by being with us and
supporting us. They differ with you fundamentally on your standard of decency.
They have great doubts as to the purity of your decency.
<p>You should be the last people on earth to talk about decency. You have
not practiced it. You are not practicing it now.
<p>You should be the last one to talk about &#8220;civic and oral poison that
has been poured into this community.&#8221; <p>You have poured in that poison. Now you want to blame it on the workers.
You have no sense of shame and no sense of decency.
<p>It may be that the workers will some day refuse to talk with you. It
may be that the priests and the councilmen will not consider you decent
enough to talk to some day. You are skating on thin ice when you talk about
decency.
<p>The people of this community have had a lot of patience with you. It
is not so certain that this patience will last forever.

<p><b><font size=+1>Among the Old Folks at the Children&#8217;s Meeting</font></b></center></p>

<p>The meeting at Belmont Park is for the children, but one sees many parents
among the crowds of children. Most of them are mothers.
<p>Here is a group of them. I hear them talking Polish and approach them.
They are excited like children, and talk about recent events.
<p>I ask them about yesterday&#8217;s picketing.
<p>&#8220;Oh, people got clubbed badly. Lots of them. The Cossacks try to hit
people on the legs as well as on the heads. But we won&#8217;t give in. We are
strong. You know they have stores here for the strikers. We can get everything
there. You cannot imagine how good and clever our strike committee is.
They get everything for us. Now they are going to send some of our children
away for vacation.&#8221; <p>The big Polish woman continued proudly, &#8220;Oh, were strong and we&#8217;ll stick
to our fight until the bosses will have to give in. Yes, they are obstinate
and bitter. Especially Forstmann, he&#8217;s still fat. Well, we can wait until
he loses his fat, too.&#8221; <p>And after this joke they roar with laughter, these stolid Polish mothers.
And their faces and eyes are full of resolution and boldness.
<p>A father with a six-year-old son joins us.
<p>&#8220;Tell me, what they talk about today, I don&#8217;t understand a word of English,&#8221; he says.
<p>I explain the purpose of the meeting to tell the children about relief.
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221; he says. &#8220;Well, you know these committees of ours are awfully
clever. They know everything. Just think. Now they want to give vacation
to the kids.&#8221; And he nodded his head with pride and wonder.
<p>&#8220;And Weisbord. It a simply hard to talk about him. He takes such care
of us. Just think, we are living here, dark people. Nobody thought of us
and our misery. The mill owners spit on us. But he thought of us and came
to help us build a union. And what a head he&#8217;s got. You know, he&#8217; got more
brains in his little toe than all those mill officials put together.&#8221; <p>At this point a big Polish woman adds her words, &#8220;Yes, our people now
say, &#8216;we have two gods, one in the sky. Another here&#8212;Weisbord.&#8217;&#8221; <p>The meeting starts and we listen to the speakers on the platform under
the tall trees. The man with the six-year-old boy wants me to translate
for him. He listens to my snatches of explanation and watches the speakers
keenly, and applauds. He knows they are talking good things for the strikers
and the strikers children. His face expresses deep, unlimited confidence
in the &#8220;Committee,&#8221; the leaders, and an abounding faith in victory.

<p>James H. Maurer, President of the Pennsylvania State Federation of Labor,
stands strong for the Passaic strikers.
<p>Addressing a mass meeting of union workers in the Harris Theatre, Pittsburgh,
May 23, brother Maurer said that the workers of Passaic are &#8220;our brothers,
fighting the common enemy of the working class. They must be supported.
Wherever workers go on strike against the oppression and exploitation of
the bosses, there is our fight. Of course we are with them.&#8221; <p>In a strong appeal for unity among all the workers, no matter in what
kind of they are organized, brother Maurer said: &#8220;We cannot stand aside
when our class is attacked. The battle of the Passaic textile workers is
our battle.&#8221; <p>Speakers representing the educational department of the Pennsylvania
State Federation of Labor have talked at strike meetings in Passaic and
funds are being raised in Pennsylvania to help us in our struggle.

<p>The world stands on tiptoe at the thrilling news of the engagement of
Marguerite Bahnsen, daughter of Christian Bahnsen, owner of the Gera Mills
and the New Jersey Worsted Mills.
<p>Marguerite will marry a count of course. His name is Hon. Richard Dawney,
son of Viscount Dawney of London.
<p>So there is one chance gone fluey for a faithful mill worker to marry
the bosses daughter.
<p>This lady and her sister Marie have spent the winter in Europe rolling
around in their dad&#8217;s money that he has squeezed out of the mill workers
who are now on strike.
<p>How could these mill barons buy titles for their daughters if the slaves
did not work for them night and day? It couldn&#8217;t be done. These little
girlies would have to earn their own living and behave themselves and not
run around with rotten dukes and counts.
<p>The union will give more to the workers and less to the decaying aristocracy
of foreign countries.

<p><b><font size=+1>Lawrence Elects Delegates for Textile Workers Conference</font></b></center></p>

<p>Last Sunday afternoon the Lawrence United Front Committee met at its
new headquarters, 81a Common Street and with great enthusiasm elected three
delegates to attend the big Amalgamation Conference of Textile Workers
Organizations which will meet at Hotel Imperial, New York City on June
5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup>.
<p>An immediate fund was raised by the organizations present to pay the
expenses of the delegates.
<p>It was the feeling of the Committee that all existing textile workers
unions should amalgamate their forces.
<p>That there should be one union for the textile industry embracing all
skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled into one powerful organization.
<p>An immediate campaign to organize the unorganized.
<p>Conditions in the Lawrence mills are so bad that a strike is liable
to break out any moment. because of this, the United Front has repeatedly
urged the textile workers of Lawrence to become organized and prepared.
Hundreds of workers have heeded the call but there are thousands of workers
in Lawrence.
<p>It is felt that this Conference will stimulate the workers to feel the
necessity of becoming organized. That it will create a feeling of national
solidarity. That it will break down the prejudice that has been existing
between [one] union or another and become united into one solid organization
to do away with:
<p>Wage cutting, Long hours, Discharge of workers because of old age, Speeding
and doubling up, Unemployment, Company unions.
<p>And fight for:
<p>More wages, Less hours, The right to work, The abolition of the speeding
and doubling up systems, Sanitary conditions.

<p><b><font size=+1>Shop Council of the Company Union in the Pacific Mill</font></b></center></p>

<p>For many years we in the Print Works of the Pacific mill have been suffering
from the poisoned gases and fumes. The windows of the Print works are shut,
the air is thick with fumes that settle on the lungs and ruin the health
of the workers.
<p>Time and again we have been demanding that something be done. For several
years now some workers have been demanding the Shop Council that a ventilation
system be installed.
<p>When the question was first brought up in the Shop Council, it was referred
to the grievance committee. From this committee it traveled to the investigation
committee. The result was that an investigation was finally made. An important
looking person looked at the walls, scribbled something with his pencil,
and promptly left. We waited for the ventilation system to be installed.
We have now been waiting for years. We are still waiting.
<p>The Shop council is evidently not very much interested in doing anything
for the welfare of the workers. The council has been doing nothing but
referring everything that we workers demanded to the management. The management
is referring it to Dooms Day.
<p>We the workers should not of be fooled any more by these tricks of the
bosses. WE MUST HAVE A REAL UNION.&#8212;ONLY THE UNITED FRONT COMMITTEE
OF TEXTILE WORKERS WILL BETTER OUR COND1TIONS.

<p><b><font size=+1>Must Have Union of the Workers</font></b></center></p>

<p>Dear Fellow Workers,
<p>I am a Lawrence worker employed in the Pacific mill. I would like to
let you brave Passaic Strikers know some of our grievances. At the present
time the mill owners are experimenting on one weaver taking charge of one
hundred and three draper looms. This system will put some more weavers
in the streets.
<p>Of course the bosses like to [see] the army of unemployed grow bigger
so that he can use the unemployed workers as a whip over the heads of those
who are employed, to cut some more of their already small wages. This will
mean some more profits to the millionaire bosses, more poverty to the workers.
<p>The company union which we have in this mill does not oppose this. They
take up petty grievances such as pieces of plaster that are about to fall
from the ceiling or ridding the place of roaches.
<p>I hope the day will come when the American Textile workers will learn
to organize like the workers in other countries. England for instance,
where before you can get a job a worker must show a union card. The union
does not allow speed up systems, which put out thousands of workers into
the streets. Organized labor dictates, not the bosses.

<p>********************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>Bosses Steal Time</font></b></center></p>

<p>In the mills here in Lawrence the bosses hit upon a scheme how to make
us work without getting any pay. They have here a rule that if you come
to work one minuet late you are docked 15 but must work the remaining 14
minuets. If you are late 15 minuets you lose one hour.
<p>Work here begins at 7:15 a. m. and there are always many workers who
are late. This slave rule gives the bosses at the end of a year thousands
of dollars of unpaid labor. The young workers are those that are hit the
hardest by this ruling.
<p>We have been getting the strike Bulletin from Passaic where they tell
us about the union and the benefits the workers get through it.
<p>Now if we in Lawrence had a union we would not have such rules or neck-breaking
speed systems and maybe get more pay too. I think if the Class conscious
workers in Lawrence would take some time and write some of the conditions
here to the Bulletin so that everybody can read, it the workers will begin
to think, and when they think they organize.

<p><b><font size=+1>Colored Workers in Lodi</font></b></center></p>

<p>I am a worker of the United Piece and Dye Works. My conditions were
very bad and had to work long hours, and poor Willie and I couldn&#8217;t eat
or wear clothes just like I wished too. I couldn&#8217;t get any vacation. I
couldn&#8217;t get any fresh air nor fresh food. I didn&#8217;t have any strength.
I felt ill all the time and worked like a slave there. There was not any
enjoyment at all. I come out on strike, and since I came out I get plenty
of fresh air and plenty of sunshine. I get clothes and shoes for myself.
<p>I learned a great deal about the bosses. They don&#8217;t care at all about
the workers, for if they did they would give them a living wage and realize
that the workers want to be organized into a union, and not a company union
either. We are going to stick together and listen to our leader, Weisbord.
<p>I have studied the history of the bosses and I know how they used to
treat the slaves in olden times. But now they wouldn&#8217;t fool them anymore,
I know, because, although I am a colored worker I stick together with the
white workers because I see that all workers slave alike. The bosses tried
all kinds of tricks to break us, but instead they united us. Fellow workers
stick together! White or Colored, Italian or Polish.

<p><b><font size=+1>I Was Born in America</font></b></center></p>

<p>We went out on strike 18 weeks ago protesting against wage cuts. We
went out on strike because it was no longer possible for us to live with
the miserly wages we were getting, and because we were fast becoming slaves
for mill owners. Our wages were miserable enough without giving us another
wage cut while mill owners profits were exceedingly higher than last year.
<p>The mill owners drew their profits from the following sources:
<p>1. Wage cuts.
<br />2. Employing mothers and aged women for night work.
<br />3. The employment of children who were under the age of 15 years and
paying them less than half of the wages and doing the same work as a grown
up.
<br />4. By using the speed up system.
<br />5. By keeping the mill in an unsanitary and unsafe condition.
<p>For these reasons we went out on strike and for the same reasons we
have been clubbed, beaten and terrorized with riot acts and other means.
<p>These who call themselves 100% Americans say that we are foreigners
who don&#8217;t belong here. I was born and bred in America and I would like
to ask these mill owners and 100% Americans where I belong if I don&#8217;t belong
here. Can they dictate where I belong and where I should go?
<p>Then there is another thing I would like to ask these so-called 100%
Americans, and that is what would they think of one of our greatest American
statesman who on Sept. 30 1859 said: &#8220;Capital is stolen labor and its only
function is to steal labor.&#8221; This man was Abraham Lincoln.

<p><b><font size=+1>"Our Position&#8221;</font></b></center></p>

<p>Tuesday, May 24<sup>th</sup>, I read the article the bosses put in the
newspapers entitled &#8220;Our position". In that article they said that they
would have nothing to do with the United Front Committee, and that our
union was not the kind of a union to have in their mills.
<p>Well, I&#8217;d like to say this much to the bosses. The United Front Committee
is made up of strikers 100 per cent, and the reason the bosses will not
meet the United Front Committee is this. We have learned a whole lot in
this strike, we have opened our eyes and the bosses seeing this, they cannot
put anything over on the United Front Committee, refuse to meet with us.
But they shall meet us in the end, and talk business. The kind of business
that we will talk is, &#8220;ONE BIG TEXTILE UNION.&#8221; They must come off their
high horses and decide to settle the strike once and for all.
<p>The second point is this: They do not want a union in the mills. They
said it was not the right kind of a Union. I know what they want. They
want us to have what they call the notorious &#8220;Company Union,&#8221; in other
words, A Bosses Fakers Union. We will not have it. It&#8217;s either &#8220;Our Union,&#8221; or the bosses can close down until they give in. we are ready to <em>fight
to a finish for OUR UNION</em> in the Textile Mills.

<p>I am a young striker, 17 years of age, and my mother was forced to go
to work for $20 a week for 48 hours, and there are six of us in the family.
When I reached the age of 14, I had to quit school and go to work to help
my mother keep things going. I also had to work while going to school.
I used to work every Saturday on a farm for $1.
<p>When my father left us the ages stood as follows: three sisters of the
ages of, 6, 8, 11. And two brothers, 10, 16; so you see that I was forced
to quit school.
<p>I went on strike because I worked in several mills and several departments
and found out that I was just like a slave. Well, we know that we are going
to win and better our conditions after we do win. I believe in all the

to work 11 to 13 hours a day under the most disgraceful conditions and
wages ever known.
<p>The following are a few instances why the young workers went out on
strike.
<p>The examining room of the U. P. D. W. employs about 100 girls. These
girls get from 16 to 18&cent; an hour. Their work is to scrub the spots
from the silk with benzene. They do this from 10 to 12 hours per day. During
this time the room is full of dust. The strong odor of benzene which goes
down into the lungs causing consumption at an early age.
<p>Numbers of young boys work in the Boil off Depot. This is one of the
worst hell holes of the U P. D W. Here the young workers work for 33 to
35&cent; per hour and from 12 to 14 hours a day. There is water continually
dripping from the ceiling caused by the steam which fills the room. There
are no lockers and they have no lunch hour. They eat their dampened lunch
with one hand and handle wet silk and soap suds with the other. At quitting
time they take off the wet working clothes and put on their street clothes
which by this time are just as wet as the working clothes.
<p>These exploited young workers are now on strike and will never go back
until these inhuman conditions are completely wiped out!

See all those priests. See the citizens in the parade. See Bainbridge Colby.

<p><b><font size=+1>Shall We Have a Workers Union or a Bosses Union</font></b></center></p>

<p>Fellow Workers:
<p>After 18 weeks of wonderful fighting we, have made the bosses say that
the workers can join a union. But the bosses want to own this union. They
want to control it. And if the bosses own the union what good is it? Will
a bosses union ever fight the boss? Will a bosses union ever strike for
more wages or less hours?
<p>The Textile Workers in the big cotton mill of Manchester. N. H. were
forced into a bosses union. And what happened? This bosses union went to
the boss and asked the boss to cut their wages 10 per cent. It was this
bosses union that gave the bosses in Passaic the idea to cut our wages.
<p>The Textile Workers in the big Pacific Mills in Lawchester, N. H. were
forced into a bosses union. And what happened? The bosses not only cut
wages 10% but also began to speed up the work. Woolen weavers running two
looms, before are now forced to run six! In the cotton mill, weavers are
running 120 looms each in some cases! Did the company Union fight this?
No, the Company Union kissed the bosses boots and said what a great company
the Pacific Mill was.
<p>Right here in Passaic in the Forstmann-Huffmann Co. Plant we have a
good example of what a bosses union means. In every room the boss had a
sucker or spy. These spies were made &#8220;delegates&#8221; of the bosses union. They
used to go to the boss and report every worker who kicked about his pay
or who kicked about the long hours of work or who kicked about the night
work for women or who kicked about the rotten stinking conditions in the
mill. The Forstmann-Huffmann Co. Union like all of Company unions was a
spy union. It was a scab union. It was a sucker union. All the honest workers
of Forstmann &amp; Huffmann have this bosses union. That&#8217;s why the Forstmann-Huffmann
workers are such good strikers. They say, with us, &#8220;To Hell with the Company
union.&#8221; <p>We don&#8217;t want a suckers union. We want a real union, a union of our
own. Over 4,000,000 workers in this country have their own union. The textile
workers in Paterson have their own union and if the textile workers can
win a union in Paterson, we can win union in Passaic.
<p>Without a union of our own we have no safety, no protection. The bosses
make ten million promises. But they don&#8217;t keep one. They will cut wages
again. They will fire all the good union fighters. They will crush us ten
times worse than before. Only a union of our own will protect us. We will
never go back until we have our own union.
<p>Down with the bosses Company Union. Three cheers for the Workers Union!

<p><b><font size=+1>The Brutes in the Schools</font></b></center></p>

<p>There maybe nothing rotten in Denmark but there is something very rotten
in our public schools.
<p>Reports come to us often and regularly of insults by the teachers to
the strikers children and mean treatment and boss propaganda in the schools.
This we might expect. The teachers on the whole do not know anything about
the conditions in the homes or about the conditions in the mills where
the parents of the children have to work.
<p>A case has come to the headquarters of the United Front Committee that
deserves attention.
<p>Little Helen Wilda, 11 years old, living with her parents and seven
other children in the family, was sent by the school nurse to the Memorial
School dental office for treatment.
<p>The girl tells this story:
<p>&#8220;When I came in the dentist put me in the chair and pulled out two of
my good teeth in the lower left jaw. This was not at all necessary. The
tooth the nurse said should be pulled and the tooth that ached was on the
other side, and he never pulled that. I didn&#8217;t want him to pull my good
teeth. It hurt awfully and I cried.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Then he asked me for fifty cents and I said I did not have any money
for my parents were on strike.&#8221; <p>&#8220;O, you are that kind, are you, he shouted and grabbed me by the throat
and threw me on the floor. He hit me on the arm and these are the marks
I have.&#8221; <p>This is a simple story, but a powerful one. The girl showed us her throat
and arms, blue and black. We saw the marks made by this brute on that helpless
girl. We saw the cavities where her sound teeth had been and we also saw
the decaying tooth which should have been pulled.
<p>If the citizens let cases like this go without attention, we will have
little left of civilization. There is a move on foot to bring this brute
lackey of the bosses to time. We shall find out if a school dentist can
pull the wrong teeth and clutch the neck and arms of helpless little girls
till they are black and blue and get away with it.
<p>It is high time that someone came to the aid of these workers and their
children. We are not ashamed of any man or woman who came from other cities
or states or countries or other worlds to help cases like this. Are you?
<p>The good people of Passaic and surrounding territory have not been aware
of the hellish condition that the brutal bosses have gradually established
in these parts.
<p>But the day is at hand for a reckoning and now many of the sincere citizens
have cast their lot with the workers, bringing pressure to bear upon the
brutal bosses and helping the workers to organize for their own protection.

<p><b><font size=+1>"The Company Union Makeshift&#8221;</font></b></center></p>

<p>This is the title appearing over a leading editorial in the current
issue of the Journal of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Worker&#8217;s
affiliated with the American Federation of Labor.
<p>This powerful trade union with over 142,000 members knows something
about company unions. It has had first hand experience with them and it
has found them a lie from beginning to end. So it warns its members and
the entire trade union movement of this country against these snaky company
committees. This is what it says:
<p>THE COMPANY UNION LIE. The company union lie consists in holding that
the company union confers the same benefits upon its members that the trade
union does …………….
<p>Members of organized labor&#8212;spokesmen for the trade union&#8212;admit
that certain corporations, where trade unions are weak, are in fact rich
enough and powerful enough to keep their workers as robots are kept. Their
bodies can be consigned to company houses, their brains can be consigned
to company experts. Their health can be consigned to company doctors, and
their politics can be consigned to company directors. Their babies can
be consigned to company hospitals, and their reading to company libraries.
They can be born, if you please, INTO A NEW KIND OF SLAVERY, a slavery
without slavery&#8217;s horror or physical pain and suffering, but no less a
slavery of mind and spirit.
<p>Then the Electrical Workers Journal quotes Father John A. Ryan of the
National Catholic Welfare Council. Father Ryan is a friend of real trade
unions, just as the Associated Societies and Parishes of Passaic and Vicinity
is a friend of real unionism and the enemy of fake company unions such
as the one Julius Forstmann put over on his workers in 1920. This is what
Father Ryan says about such sucker organizations as the F &amp; H &#8220;representative
assembly":
<p>&#8220;After more than three centuries there approaches a return to feudalism.
The new feudalism is political and industrial. Not improbably it will be
more or less benevolent! The lords of industry will realize at least for
a considerable number of years that their position and profits will be
more secure if they refrain from the cruder and coarser forms of injustice,
and permit the dependent classes, both urban and rural, to obtain a moderate
share of the products of industry. The masses will probably enjoy a slightly
higher degree of economic welfare than has ever been within their reach
before. But they will enjoy it at the expense of genuine freedom. The mind
of the masses will have become A SLAVE MIND. Possibly this is the kind
of society that we want in this country, but, it is not the kind that made
and kept America free. It is emphatically not the kind of society that
committed the destinies of the country, to the custody of Abraham Lincoln.&#8221; <p>The Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Journal then continues with its
editorial as follows:
<p>&#8220;All of us ought also to see clearly the dire consequences of a widespread
placid acceptance of company unionism now. Such a stupid acceptance of
company unionism will mean a drag and delay on industry and on political
and traditional democracy.&#8221; <p>The company union, Passaic workers now understand clearly, is undemocratic,
un-American, contrary to the traditions and practices of American labor.
It is a complete surrender to the boss.
<p>Our cry must continue: &#8220;Down with Forstmann&#8217;s joke of a union. Up with
the real union&#8212;the union of the textile workers!&#8221; <center>
<p>***********************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>"Poor Jackasses&#8221;</font></b></center></p>

<p>Dear Fellow Workers:
<p>Just a few lines to tell you about the hard life of us working ladies
in the New Jersey Worsted Spinning Co. About the sanitary conditions in
the mill&#8212;they are horrible. The roaches are as big as an animal and
we had to put our lunch in the box where they were, with oil, too, and
when a person ate it, he ate more wool and oil than food.
<p>Once a wealthy person asked me if we had any lunch hour. Why, when the
new night superintendent came in, we wasn&#8217;t even allowed to eat at all
and when he came around we had to hide our bit of sandwich under our dirty
apron. Oh, you rich fellows, if I could only speak with you (and Mr. McBride
too), I&#8217;d tell you what excellent conditions we have in the mills. [Yes,
say] they have excellent conditions for the bosses. When their time comes
for [lunch] they go into the office and take a good drink and sit down
for an hour and then for the hour after. But us poor jackasses, we even
have no time to go to the toilet, for the night superintendent that the
bosses appointed to be a sucker, he comes to the women&#8217;s toilet. Maybe
a lady just fell down on the cement floor to [rest] herself a [minuet]
and he runs in and yell at her, &#8220;Come on, go to your machine!&#8221; For us poor
working people there is no freedom at all.
<p>When my husband brings in $24 a week and we pay $25 a month rent, where
is the food and clothing to come from? Unless you hold up somebody, the
wife has to go in the mill and slave also. From 2:30 to 12 at night, and
get up at seven o&#8217;clock to send the children to school and fix dinner and
then supper and then again to work. There is no rest at all. If we had
an American standard of living, there would be less sickness and more health.

<p><b><font size=+1>"A Decent Place to Live in&#8221;</font></b></center></p>

<p>The Northwestern Christian Advocate comments editorially on the Passaic
reign of terror:
<p>It is not a local matter that in Passaic, N. J., in the course of a
textile strike, the local police have revived the old Russian outdoor sport
of clubbing the people. The attack of the police on the strikers, who were
assembled in orderly and legal fashion, clubbing them over the heads, running
them down, turning water upon them, is a matter to which the whole country
must pay attention. The police did not act as guardians of the law but
as partisans of the employers. It is hard to see where the part they played
differed from that of the thug, frequently hired by lawless employers to
"beat up&#8221; the strikers.
<p>One picturesque feature of this lawlessness of the police is a symbol
of the real character of the issues at stake. When the police assaulted
the crowd with gas and clubs, many veterans of the World War turned over
to the strikers the steel helmets and gas masks which they had used in
what we fondly termed &#8220;The battle [strike] of freedom&#8221; in France. It was
very fitting that these implements which had done service for freedom in
France should be used again as protection from the Cossacks of America.
For the battle of the strikers against the police in this instance was
actually a battle for American ideals of freedom.
<p>It was only a few years ago that all the billboards of Passaic were
plastered with large posters with the slogan: &#8220;To Make the World a Decent
Place to Live in.&#8221; It is a good slogan. It did great service a few years
ago. It is still needed in America.
<p>We will never make America &#8220;a decent place to live in&#8221; without the preservation
of American rights and free speech and assemblage.
<p>We would not have seen this editorial had not the bosses open shop organ
The New York Commercial reprinted it and called it &#8220;utter nonsense.&#8221; We
are always glad to see the anti-labor newspapers print such &#8220;nonsense&#8221; even if they do get nonsensical themselves in commenting upon it.
<p>The workers of Passaic can decide very well whether it is the truth
or not.
<center>
<p>***********************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>High Tariff And Low Wages</font></b></center></p>

<p>A statement just issued by the Peoples Reconstruction League of Washington
D. C. has some highly significant information for the Passaic textile workers.
<p>You know the textile bosses are always going to Congress and whining
that they must have a high Tariff on woolens and worsteds or they will
not be able to pay &#8220;good wages&#8221; to their workers. They weep a lot when
they go to Washington about how the high tariff rates, will help the worker,
"fill the dinner pail&#8221; and create prosperity in the industry.
<p>We workers in Passaic know from experience just what that prosperity
looks like. Now we are finding out that the bosses prosperity is not the
workers prosperity. The boss hogs it for himself. This is the way the People&#8217;s
Reconstruction League report puts it:
<p>&#8220;Wages paid in factories manufacturing textiles and their products were,
in 1921, 21:1 per cent of the value of the product; in 1923, however, only
18.4 per cent of their value.&#8221; <p>Which simply means that the workers received less proportionately of
the value of the textiles made in 1923, under a higher tariff, than they
did in 1921 under a lower tariff. And yet, when Forstmann and his crew
went to Washington to plead for the higher tariff, they told the Senators
and Congressmen that it would mean higher wages for the worker! It has
meant just the opposite for the worker It has meant higher profits for
the bosses.
<p>Why is this so? Because the workers have had no union with which to
take from the bloated mill owners a larger share of the value of the manufactured
product.
<p>Tariff or no tariff, the workers will get the lean end of the bacon
until when?&#8212;Until a Real Union is built. Until the workers have POWER
to take their full share of prosperity.
<center>
<p>***********************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Bosses Want Us to Go Back</font></b></center></p>

<p>What do the bosses mean by telling us to go back to work now and talk
the matter of settlement over afterward?
<p>Everybody knows that if we went back first, the bosses would do with
us just what they pleased. They would certainly not recognize our union
any more if we went back first than they would if we stick to the bitter
end.
<p>All they want to do is to try to fool us and get a stranglehold on us
once more. If they could only get us into their mills, they could browbeat
us and fire all the best fighters in the union.
<p>They did that before. They did not even listen to the representatives
of the committee. They fired the entire delegation. That was their friendliness
at that time. Have they changed since then? Can the leopard change his
spots? How have they acted during the strike? Have the failed to use all
their opposition to our union? Have they omitted any brutality within their
reach? Could they possibly have been more hostile than they have been?
<p>And now they tell us to come back and say the workers will be met with
kindness and that they will be treated decently. We do not believe them.
They do not deserve our confidence. Their word is no good. They are not
reliable. They lie to us and when their lie cannot fool us, they threaten
us.
<p>Nothing will save us except power. Power of the union that we build
is what we must have. We are not going to build a union for them to enslave
us with. Our own Union is our only safeguard. We have it and will keep
it
<center>
<p>************************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Kind Of Union</font></b></center></p>

<p>And now the mill owners come and tell us that &#8220;they will not recognize
any organization as speaking collectively for their employees except that
organization, in purpose and method, thoroughly harmonizes with the peculiar
conditions in which the industry and the particular mills are subjected.&#8221; <p>In other words, the bosses say they will not have a union run by the
workers, but only a union run by the bosses themselves.
<p>That is old stuff.
<p>You had a union run by yourself in the Forstmann and Huffmann mills.
Why did the workers walk out if that union was such a fine thing for the
workers? Why are the Forstmann &amp; Huffmann workers some of the most
loyal workers of the United Front Committee? Why have they a greater disgust
for the company union than the rest of the workers?
<p>They know what the company union is? They have felt its iron heel. They
have experienced the humility of being in a union that has stood for the
bosses and only for the bosses. They know that this company union is full
of rats and stool pigeons and spies, and that the company uses this union
to fool the workers and to keep them in constant terror.
<p>Of all rotten things the company union is the rottenest. It is a perversion.
It is a lie. It is a piece of hypocrisy. It is a mantle to cover up the
skullduggery of the bosses. It is an instrument of hypnotism to put the
workers to sleep. It is a sleight of hand method to rob the workers. It
is the trick of the juggler to deceive the slaves. It is the jimmy of the
burglar to get into the homes of the workers to rob them. It is the gun
of the [footpad] that terrorizes the innocent. It is the slimy, dishonest,
hypocritical, treasonable, agency of the bosses whereby the workers may
successfully be skinned and kept in utter subjection and helplessness.
<p>What would the bosses say if we should come to them dictate to them
what kind of union they must have for themselves? Wouldn’t they think that
we were nutty if we should tell them that we will not recognize their organization,
but that their organization must suit us?
<p>What a silly and idiotic bunch they are!
<p>And now that the workers have become wise to their underhanded game
they get sore and tell us they won&#8217;t play in our yard.
<p>But we have equally settled that never as long as we breathe the breath
of life will we submit to the company union that the bosses want to fool
us with. That is settled.
<p>The bosses can rave for all time, and decide that we are not decent
enough and that they will not meet with us and recognize our union, but
that does not change our position.
<p>We have concluded that life is not worth living under the old conditions
in the mills. We have concluded that if we go back without our own union
we will be worse than before and to submit to such hell is unthinkable.
<p>No. You may kill us, but you cannot drive us back to the mills without
our union.
<p>If you understand that, you may save a lot of valuable time.
<center>
<p>************************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>Judge Tangles Himself Up</font></b></center></p>

<p>There is nothing so abominable as a stupid and prejudiced judge. People
expect dignity and a little degree of decency of a court. We have had a
lot of the other kind in this strike.
<p>On Monday ten young men, some strikers and some others, were out for
a ride. On their way they sang songs and at times shouted, &#8220;Hurrah for
Weisbord!&#8221; <p>Whereupon a patriotic cop arrested them.
<p>Being dragged before the judge he told them it was a horrible thing
for them to sing and make a noise in the night.
<p>Then turning right around he asked them: &#8220;Why not yell &#8216;Hurrah for work;&#8217;
instead of &#8216;Hurrah for Weisbord.?"&#8217;
<p>So it was not the noise after all that mattered with the judge. He wanted
them to shout the shout of the bosses.
<p>Now what business has the judge to take sides like that? The men were
charged with shouting and singing. If they had been singing and shouting
for the bosses it would have been all right, and no arrest would have been
made.
<p>If the judges think they can get the respect of the people with that
kind of stuff they may have to guess several times.
<p>The same judge sentenced one of the party to get a job before noon the
same day. That is just as foolish as it can be. Suppose the young man could
not find a job by noon, what then? Ten days in jail.
<p>There are millions of workers who would thank the judge if he would
find decent jobs for them. With unemployment as it is in every industry
the judge takes a long chance when he asks this man to get a job by noon.
<p>This is the kind of judges the workers will get rid of when the time
comes. We shall not tolerate them beyond the present term.

<p>*******************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>Thugs and Strikebreakers</font></b></center></p>

<p>Another attempt to break the strike we must be prepared to meet. We
are reliably informed that a certain New York strike-breaking agency is
about to send some of its choice collection of thugs and ex-convicts to
mingle with the strikers and create dissention. They will try to look like
workers and talk like workers. They will talk several languages. They may
talk American&#8212;the language of violence.
<p>This is an old trick. It has been tried in every strike of any consequence
in a final effort to demoralize workers unity.
<p>Several thousand dollars will be spent on this job. The gutters will
be raked for professional provocateurs to do it. They will mingle with
the workers and try discourage them. They will circulate all sorts of lies.
They will try to get workers to return to the mills. They will be paid
money by the mills to do this dirty work.
<p>We are ready for these underworld characters. We shall not be tricked
or fooled by their stories. We know who they are, and who has sent them
here, and who is paying the bill.
<p>We suggest to the mills that they might better save this money for the
wages fund for workers on looms and spinning frames after we have returned
to the mills WITH OUR UNION.
<p>Money spent on dicks and thugs will not make the wheels turn. It will
not make scabs of strikers. It will be wasted.

<p><b><font size=+1>Women Win Strikes</font></b></center></p>

<p>Suppose we had had a lot of scab women in this strike. Or suppose we
had had a lot of women without guts, who would be whimpering every day,
"Oh, I&#8217;m sick of this old strike. When is it ever going to end?&#8221; Suppose
we had had women, who would say, every time their old man got clubbed on
the picket line, &#8220;Serves you right. Why don&#8217;t you go back to the mill where
you belong, then you won&#8217;t get clubbed,&#8221; or &#8220;It&#8217;s your fault I can&#8217;t pay
the rent this spring, and the landlord coming after me every day.&#8221; <p>Could we win the strike if had women like that around? We couldn&#8217;t have
held out one month, not to speak of four months successfully as we done.
No, we haven&#8217;t any such specimens of women around in this strike. Here,
on the contrary, it [is] the women who have been right on the job on the
picket line and at the meetings from first to last. Very often, it is Mrs.
Striker here who rousts her old man out of bed in the morning to go on
the picket line. And in the evening, its just as likely as not that she
leaves the kids with him to mind while she runs off to a women&#8217;s meeting.
Well, aren’t they his kids, too? And while he may not say much, while he
may look kind of dumbfounded sometimes, he probably is thinking, the old
crank, while he scratches his head, &#8220;Well, after all, my old woman, she
isn&#8217;t so bad. She seems to have a lot of guts, after all. I guess I knew
what I was doing when I picked her.&#8221; <p>His wife is his partner now, not some sort of truck-horse or cow who
worked like a slave in the kitchen and never knew a thing of what was going
on outside. She is his partner who works with him in the mill, and in strike
time goes on the picket line with him, gets clubbed with him and works
like an equal in everything. And she is the sort of woman that is the very
backbone of this strike, who is building up the Union and winning the strike
for all the textile workers.

He reviewed the history of the strike&#8212;the wage cuts and brutal disregard
of the workers interests that had caused it. In flaming words he painted
a picture of the organized campaigns of terror which the bosses have launched
against the strikers in an attempt to break the strike as well as the tricky
moves by which the bosses have tried to fool the workers. Again and again
he was applauded as he drove home to the delegates and to the strikers
who knew the story so well, how bitter has been the fight and how courageous
the struggle of the workers.
<p>&#8220;This successful conference proves that the Passaic textile strike is
not a local issue but concerns the workers internationally,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
union smashing campaign of the employers, the wage cutting campaign to
which unskilled labor has been especially subjected to, has been going
on for years. In wage cutting, the textile workers have suffered most.&#8221; <p>&#8220;The Passaic strike is a strike for all of unorganized and organized
labor. It is a strike to put a stop to union smashing by launching an effort
to organize the million textile workers. Organization of the textile workers
will inspire the workers in steel, oil, automobiles and other industries
to organize. The Passaic strike is a strike to put a stop to wage slashes
and if we win back our wage cuts, then other industrial despots will hesitate
to cut wages in their industries.
<p>&#8220;The lesson of the Passaic strike is that the unorganized [must] be
organized. The further lesson is that there must be placed into operation
the widest possible united fronts in the labor field so that all of labor
may withstand the onslaughts of the capitalists. There must be trade union
unity and a compact between all of labor and its sympathizers if the workers
in this country are not to be further disorganized and exploited by wage
cuts. The Passaic strike is actually your strike and as your strike you
must help to win it.&#8221; <p>Elizabeth Gurly Flynn spoke for defense. Declaring that the mill owners
were determined to take revenge upon the leaders of the strike through
the courts. &#8220;Weisbord has been framed up and indicted. Jack Rubenstein
has been indicted and beaten up in jail so badly that he had to be sent
to a hospital. Nearly three hundred workers have been arrested and held
under various charges. The mill owners are determined to deprive the workers
of the services of their leaders. We must build a defense fund that no
striker can serve unjust terms as a punishment. A victory will not be complete
until we are assured that they will not be thrown into jail for long terms.&#8221; <p>Robert W. Dunn, of the American Civil Liberties Union, spoke upon the
abrogation of all constitutional guarantees by the mill owners and their
tools, reciting the outrages perpetrated during this and other strikes
in New Jersey. &#8220;The fight for the civil liberties guaranteed by our constitution
must continue,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;These have been denied us in New Jersey.
Not only strikers but strikers friends have been arrested, given unfair
trials, and unjust sentences.&#8221; <p>An appeal for extended relief conferences, for help of all kinds was
made by Alfred Wagenknecht, secretary of relief to the delegates present.
"Strike relief is not charity,&#8221; he told them. &#8220;Strike relief is a fundamental
essential of the struggle of the workers against their exploiters. Strike
relief in any battle is forthcoming because the workers knew that they
have mutual interests and are part of the gigantic army of workers engaged
in, not only a national, but also an international conflict with the employers
and imperialists.&#8221; <p>&#8220;The international character of strike relief is shown by the contributions
that went forward from many countries to the textile strikers in Shanghai
and Bombay. It is shown by the recent contribution of three million rubles
to the striking British miners, by the unions of Soviet Russia. The Passaic
strike is no longer a local struggle. Organizations from everywhere have
entered into it.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Workers from all over the world are beginning to concern themselves
with strikes in all parts of the world.&#8221; <p>&#8220;The Passaic strike is your struggle because you are part of the working
class.&#8221; You have responsibilities in this struggle because a defeat will
be your loss and in a victory you will also win. You must go out of this
conference resolved to broaden your contacts, widen your relief activity,
to organize relief conferences in at least 30 cities. If this strike lasts
all summer, relief must be forthcoming in a steady stream. The children
must receive special attention at once. Milk and nutritious meals for the
textile strikers children is the slogan upon which renewed collections
must be made.&#8221; <p>&#8220;We need clothing. We need shoes. Strikers come in every day and ask
for a little bit of cloth to make a little girl some bloomers or a little
boy a shirt. We give them an old dress to make over. Nothing is lost here.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Children need shoes. Men and women need shoes so that they can go on
the picket lines and to the meetings. And always we need money for food.
The response has been wonderful but still we need a wider and greater response.&#8221; He explained the working of the relief system that does not allow food
relief to any family that has any resources at all in the way of savings
or credit. He stated that the relief was run almost entirely by the strikers
themselves.
<p>&#8220;I want you to take back to your organizations the knowledge that the
relief work in Passaic is proceeding on a basis both economical and just,&#8221; he told the delegates.
<p>The delegates spent the morning on a tour of Passaic, which took them
past all the mills and the historic places where the brutal clubbings,
the use of fire hose and tear bombs, the blackjack and the riot guns have
left their indelible marks upon the men, women and children strikers.
<p>Delegates were present from all over the east, including Detroit, Boston,
Philadelphia, Lawrence, Mass., Katonah, N. Y., New Haven, Conn., New Jersey
cities as well as New York City, and other points.
<p>Many delegates spoke at the meeting, pledging the support of their organizations
to the strike.
<p>&#8220;The Amalgamated Clothing Workers will do everything in their power
to keep money and relief pouring in until the Passaic strike is won,&#8221; declared
Charles Ervin of that organization.
<p>&#8217;&#8217;For every dollar you have given you owe another dollar,&#8221; urged Mercer
Greene Johnson of the Baltimore conference. He told how he had lost his
position as rector of Trinity Church, Newark, because of his sympathy with
the Paterson silk strike of 1919, and concluded that &#8220;the years since then
have been the best of my life.&#8221; <p>R. S. Kling declared that all textile centers are looking toward Passaic
as toward a leader, and suggested that a school for speakers be established
here to develop leaders among the workers for possible strikes in other
centers.
<p>Ben Thomas of the Relief Conference of Philadelphia said that he would
take back a message of the &#8220;wonderful spirit&#8221; of Passaic and urge redoubled
support in Philadelphia.
<p>Kate Gitlow spoke for the United Council of Workingclass Housewives
and told of the two kitchens already established for strikers children
where a thousand children are now fed. &#8220;We must feed 10,000 children if
the strike continues,&#8221; she said.
<p>Abraham Binns, a veteran weaver, scarred in many battles, declared that
Passaic &#8220;had made a good job,&#8221; and that in twenty years of experience with
labor organizations the Passaic strike stood out as a remarkable struggle.
<p>&#8220;The Detroit Federation of Labor officially endorsed the strike last
Wednesday,&#8221; said Jacob C. Robinson, vice president of the Pressmen&#8217;s Union,
No. 2. &#8220;On the basis of this, I hope to establish a weekly contribution
of $500, and send a carload of clothes very soon.&#8221; <p>&#8220;The textile workers of all New England look to Passaic,&#8221; was another
message brought by A. Bimba Laisve.
<p>Obermeyer of the Amalgamated Food Workers, said that his organization
was prepared to send further large donations of food.
<p>The Rev. C. L. Orbach of the local Slavic Committee, A Wise of the International
Ladies Garment Workers, Pascal Cosgrove of the Shoe Workers, delegates
of the carpenters and the jewelry workers, Young Pioneers of America, Workers
Party, businessmen&#8217;s associations&#8212;all gave their pledges to carry on
for relief until the textile strikers win, until their demands for a bare
living wage and a union are met by the bosses.
<p>Letters and telegrams sending greetings and assurance of moral and financial
support were read to the Conference. These came from various points in
the United States, such as Los Angeles, Calif.; Toledo, Ohio; Rochester,
N. Y.; Milwaukee, Wis.; Detroit, Mich.; Mattapan, Mass.; New York, N. Y.;
Hudson Heights, N. J.; Keene, N. H. and Auburn, Me.

<p><b><font size=+1>Resolution On Relief</font></b></center></p>

<p>This textile center of New Jersey is indeed an industrial hell. Decades
of starvation wages, long hours of labor, night work, child labor, spy
systems, persecutions, vocational diseases, unsanitary workshops and homes
and miserable poverty drive the textile workers to periodic revolts despite
the fact that the mass of them are unorganized.
<p>Textile strikes throughout labor history have been historical battles
for the right to organize and for a bare living wage. No group of industrial
lords are more skilled at turning the blood of their wage slaves into exorbitant
profits than are the textile barons. There are one million of these workers
who need a union to protect them.
<p>The big Passaic strike of today is one of a series of revolts against
the inhuman exploitation of the textile baron. The Passaic textile strike
is, however, a more heroic and courageous battle, because of the lessons
these poverty stricken workers have learned from previous struggles with
the employing class.
<p>The textile strikers of Passaic and vicinity have withstood every form
of violence and viciousness that the mill owners could invent. They have
braved the brutal police, jails, riot guns and tear gas bombs. Their wives
and children have been trampled upon and many strikers and sympathizers
jailed. Mounted police, on horse and motorcycle, have ridden through and
over strikers peacefully marching along the public highways. The clubs
of the arms of the law have broken many strikers heads. This strike has
become known the world over for its brutality and abrogation of civil rights
to which the strikers have been subjected.
<p>We, the delegates to the Support the Passaic Strike Conference, gathered
here today, cannot of course stand shoulder to shoulder with these brave
workers in their daily conflicts with the powers of the textile barons.
We can, however, in the many cities from which we come, arouse the workers
and all sympathizers to the need of such support as they can render.
<p>The longer the struggle, the more need is there for the moral and financial
support of the millions of workers and the thousands of workers organizations
and sympathizers.
<p>We must support this strike. We must help to win this strike by giving
the strikers, their families and children, the bread they need to carry
on. Relief funds in the thousands of dollars must continue to pour into
Passaic. Money from us and those with whom we come in contact will help
to win for the strikers a living wage and a union.
<p>This Conference, therefore, calls upon all labor unions, workers fraternal
organizations, and other sympathetic organizations and individuals to join
hands in each city, and upon the basis of the broadest possible united
front, begin to gather relief funds by organizing relief conferences.
<p>Relief conferences that are functioning today prove that this organized
method of gathering relief funds, meets with the widest success. Tag days,
house to house collections, shop collections, bazaars, concerts, mass meetings,
solicitation of funds from organization treasuries, these are undertakings
which a steadily functioning conference makes possible.
<p>This general conference indorses the organization of relief conferences
in every city, and advises that a group of organizers be placed in the
field at once for this purpose.
<p>A special campaign for children&#8217;s relief should be inaugurated at once.
Thousands of undernourished strikers children must have our aid. Years
of starvation wages have resulted in 58 percent of them being underweight
and weak from undernourishment. An appalling fact of the night work of
mothers and of undernourishment due to low wages, is shown in the mortality
of the Passaic textile strikers children, the death rate being 50 percent
greater than among other children of New Jersey.
<p>We must help save these children whom the textile barons through their
intense system of exploitation are actually murdering. This conference
advises the inauguration of a campaign for $100,000 for children&#8217;s relief.
The sums of money collected to be used to purchase milk for the thousands
of textile workers little children, many of whom have been deprived of
sufficient milk since infancy; to establish additional kitchens where the
children may be fed one nutritious meal daily; to give them more playgrounds;
to place the most needy in workers camps. We must help strengthen these
children for the struggle they will someday have to make against the exploiters,
and aiding the strikers children means helping to win this strike.
<p>Finally, this conference calls upon all of labor and all its sympathizers
to remain steadily at work gathering relief funds during the whole period
of the strike. The textile bosses have decided to fight the strikers to
a finish. We declare we shall be in at the finish, but that the finish
shall be victory for the workers.
<p>The 19<sup>th</sup> week of the struggle begins Monday. We cheer you
[Passaic] Textile Strikers, with the promise that this 19<sup>th</sup>
week finds us as keen to assist as at any period. We are with you for a
STRONG UNION and a LIVING WAGE.

<p><b><font size=+1>Shall We Have a Thiel Agency Union or Textile Workers
Union?</font></b></center></p>

<p>The Shop Council or company union chiefs of the Pacific Mill, and 184
Broadway are again carrying out the orders of the bosses. They are paid
to mislead the workers and to organize a scab union prepared to stab the
workers in the back. The same individuals who are on the bosses plant and
production committee, whose business it is to increase production and the
huge profits of the owners by introducing speed up systems, doubling up
the work, and throwing thousands of workers out of the mills to starve,
are also organizing a scab union at 184 Broadway.
<p>The Lawrence workers must know the facts about the clever agents of
the bosses who are already offering five dollars a week strike pay in order
to allure the workers away from the only organization that is made up of
workers
and fights the bosses&#8212;the United Front Committee of Textile Workers.
<p>The Thiel Detective Agency of industrial spies organized the Shop Council
and plant committee of the Pacific mill. The nest of industrial spies and
suckers paid by the Thiel Agency are behind the activities of the individuals
of the Pacific plant committee.
<p>Whenever a group of workers begin to organize themselves for better
conditions, the paid stools, of the bosses always raise the cry of &#8220;Communism,
Moscow, and outside agitators.&#8221; This trick is too old to fool any intelligent
workers. Every scab, every spy, every profiteering boss, every exploiter
of labor, every crooked labor faker have used that trick since the workers
began to organize their unions. In Passaic, the heroic struggle of our
16,000 fellow workers for bread, was also attacked by the bosses and their
spies as the work of &#8220;Moscow, Communists and extremists.&#8221; The only ones
who scab in Passaic now, who take the bread from the mouths of little children
are the members of the Forstmann-Huffmann shop council or company union.
That council was organized by the same detective agency that is operating
the Pacific shop council and the union at 184 Broadway.
<p>The workers [of] Lawrence shrink from contact with the lowest and most
vile creature on two legs, the industrial spy, professional scab and sucker.
<p>The United Front Committee of the Lawrence Textile workers is the only
organization affiliated with the United Front Committee of Passaic. The
United Front Committee of Lawrence has cleaned out the suckers and company
union agents from its ranks. It is the only organization consisting of
workers and free from the influence of the bosses and detective agencies.
The United Front Committee proceeds to organize the textile workers of
Lawrence and unites all textile workers organizations into one solid United
Front which will win better conditions of life and higher wages for the
textile workers.

<p><b><font size=+1>Workers Fight for Sacco and Vanzetti</font></b></center></p>

<p>In spite of the insidious campaign of intimidation and terrorism carried
on by the American legion, and the Thiel Detectives of the Company union
in an effort to stop the meeting, hundreds of Lawrence workers turned out
to declare their solidarity with Sacco and Vanzetti. Stanley Clark of the
International Labor Defense, received a splendid ovation while the audience
stood up and cheered Albert Weisbord, leader of the Passaic Strike, and
Elizabeth Gurley Flynn well known leader of the strike of 1912.
<p>Sacco and Vanzetti, declared the speakers, are innocent. The judges
of the Supreme Court know that they are innocent. Their only crime consists
of their loyalty to labor. It is for that crime that the bosses of Massachusetts
are thirsty for their blood. The Supreme Court has refused them a new trial
because they know that the outcome of a new trial can only be the complete
liberation of Sacco and Vanzetti. The district attorney and the Supreme
Court are afraid to put their state witnesses on the stand. They know that
they have been proven perjurers and liers, and that neither Sacco nor Vanzetti
were any where near the murder scene at South Braintree. The masters courts
have said the last word, &#8220;Sacco and Vanzetti must die.&#8221; It is now up to
the workers to say in a mighty voice, &#8220;Sacco and Vanzetti must live.&#8221; <p>&#8220;The Lawrence workers are preparing once again to take their rightful
place in the front ranks of American labor,&#8221; declared the chairman representing
the United Front Committee of Textile Workers: &#8220;Neither the American Legion,
the Thiel agents of the company union, nor the hysterical propaganda of
the newspapers will stop the United Front Committee from organizing the
textile workers to struggle against poverty, forced unemployment, the speed-up
and starvation. Soon you workers may expect new attacks on the United Front
Committee by the bosses. Soon you will receive circulars shouting, &#8216;Reds&#8217;,
&#8217;Moscow,&#8217; and &#8216;outsiders&#8217;. When you hear that, tell these people that you
are wise to the tricks of industrial spies and bosses agents!&#8221; <p>Joseph Salerno, local leader, especially amongst the Italian workers,
analyzed the Sacco and Vanzetti case as a frame-up and a grave insult to
the entire Italian race. The cause of Sacco and Vanzetti is the cause of
every worker. The workers of Lawrence especially know that only labor can
save these victims of the bosses greed and vengeance. It was the demonstrations
and protests of the workers that saves Ettor and Giovanetti in the 1922
frame-up. Lawrence labor must declare Sacco and Vanzetti are dear to the
working class. They shall not die.

<p>After working for five years in the Arlington mills from 7:15 to 5,
I received as a reward for my good work a button. After giving my best
five years to the mill I have as a reward a button. And this is all I possess
after five years of toil and sweat. And this is all I now possess after
giving five years of my strength and energy to the mill owners. In these
five years my mill owners have made more than five millions of clear profit.
In these five years the mill owners have invested thousands of dollars
in speed up systems which sapped the life out of us workers. In these five
years the mill owners have spent many a happy day in Europe. In these five
years I have starved many a day. Now I have a button to take care of myself

<p>We workers did not expect much from the industrial commission appointed
several weeks ago by Peter Carr, to find means and ways of bringing new
industries into Lawrence to give work to the thousands of workers who are
knocking about for work. We know through experience that no help to the
workers can come from these quarters. And do you think we were right?
<p>The industria1 commission met. And what do you think they have suggested
as a remedy for unemployment? What do you think was the chief subject of
discussion at the meeting of this commission? You would never guess. All
Through this meeting they were talking and arguing how the 54 hour week
can be introduced again in the mills of Lawrence. This is how the city
government solves our problems. This is how the bosses want to do away
with unemployment. More exploitation, more working hours, more unemployment
and more starvation.

<p>An excerpt from a recent Report on Conditions of Women and Children
in Industry.
<p>Statement on 46 cotton mills investigated in New England States.
<p>&#8220;Dust and lint abounded in the picker rooms and card rooms. Lint is
given off in all the processes up to and including spinning. The dust can
be kept down by frequent sweeping, scrubbing and cleaning but in most of
the mills visited there was an objectionable and wholly unnecessary amount

<p>The noise of the machinery is nerve wrecking; the work in many occupations
requires close and constant attention and in the spinning and weaving rooms,
the air is hot and moist, often to an injurious degree.
<p>Wash rooms for women workers were not common, being found only in thirteen
mills. Dressing rooms were rarer still.
<p>It is not pin money nor because they prefer it to the home that women
work. They do it to make a living and often enough, a poor living at that.

<p><b><font size=+1>Company Unionism in Practice</font></b></center></p>

<p>What some Forstmann &amp; Hufftmann Workers Think of the BUNK UNION
--- (Taken from affidavits signed and sworn to by F &amp; H strikers)
<p>The following are statements made under oath by workers who have &#8220;enjoyed&#8221; the benevolent tyranny of the F &amp; H company union for nearly 6 years.
These workers are the most intelligent, active, independent, and self-respecting
ones on the F &amp; H payroll. What they say should be of interest to the
Botany and other workers whose bosses are now willing to &#8220;concede&#8221; the
company union in order to break the strike:
<center>
<p>Worker A:</center></p>

<p>&#8220;The F &amp; H employees were organized into what is called a &#8220;representative
assembly&#8221; in May 1920. They were organized by Mr. Reinhold, personnel manager
of the F &amp; H mills. Mr. R. called a meeting of all employees and asked
them to pick out a representative from each room, and forced them to vote.
<p>&#8220;Mr. R. passed out slips with check numbers and told them they had to
vote. The company paid for the time the employees spent at the meeting.
The workers elected 54 representatives to the assembly and Mr. R. chose
54 persons. About two or three times a year the company held a general
meeting. At these meetings, the mill provided free meals, cigars, cigarettes
and all kinds of refreshments to the representatives.&#8221; <p>&#8220;During 1925, the representative assembly under the influence of the
mill managers, put into effect certain rules with reference to speeding
up the work.
<p>(Here he details the several ways in which this was done in the spinning
and weaving departments.)
<p>&#8220;We were told that grievances as to conditions, wages, etc., could not
be brought before the Representative Assembly unless they had first been
presented to the authorities (management&#8212;in the form of a &#8220;docket committee")
<p>&#8220;I know that the workers in the Forstmann &amp; Huffmann plant objected
to the speed-up system, the laying off of men, requiring the remaining
men to do all the work of the men laid off, the unsanitary conditions and
the low wages.&#8221; <center>
<p>Worker B:</center></p>

<p>&#8220;I have been a member of the shop committee and of the representative
assembly for the past three years. At the meetings of the assembly the
workers were all afraid to speak concerning conditions. I never in my three
years membership in the assembly spoke once at the meetings, because I
knew what I said would be taken down and used against me.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I was injured in the mill and requested one of the elected &#8220;representatives&#8221; to preset my case before the assembly to see whether any operation was
required. The &#8216;rep.&#8217; conferred with the doctor and the mill authorities,
who decided that this was not the kind of a case to present to the Representative
Assembly.&#8221; <p>&#8220;I was elected a representative in 1923. I attended regularly the meetings
of the Representative Assembly and I know of my own knowledge, cases where
persons who had complaints to bring before the Representative Assembly
were told that they would lose their positions if they would do so.&#8221; <p>&#8220;The procedure in accordance with the rules of the organization (company
union) was that if anyone had grievance or complaint to make to the Assembly,
he was first required to take it up with what was known as the Docket Committee,
most of whose members were connected with the employment office of the
mills. If this committee ruled that a complaint was not to be brought before
the &#8220;representative assembly&#8221;, it was not brought. This committee determined
before each meeting of the company union what was to be discussed.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Since 1922 the popularity of the assembly has constantly decreased
because the workers felt it was nothing but a company union. Workers have
refused to be elected as representatives and on several occasions voted
for famous race horses for their &#8216;representative&#8217;!
<p>&#8220;Before the strike, members of the representative assembly were requested
by me and other workers to present grievances as to conditions, wages,
etc., before the Assembly. These matters could not be brought before the
Representative Assembly until they were first presented to the mill authorities.
The members of the shop committee (company union) were all afraid to bring
these questions before the mill managers.&#8221; <p>The above quotations tell us something about the FAKE UNION at the F
&amp; H! How it makes cowards out of workers. How it refuses to take up
their just grievances. How it serves as the tool of the management to terrorize
and exploit the workers in every department.
<p>More affidavits on this subject will be presented in subsequent issues
of the Textile Bulletin.

<p><b><font size=+1>They Arrest Ben Stolberg A Little</font></b></center></p>

<p>If you want to get arrested a little, all you have to do is to go to
Passaic or Garfield and talk to the strikers and tell them to have their
own union and not to bother with the god damn company union.
<p>That is what happened to Benjamin Stolberg, outside agitator from New
York, graduate of Harvard &#8216;20&#8217;, Phi Beta Kappa, listed in &#8220;Who&#8217;s Who?&#8221; Poet, writer for the Nation and the Times, brought up in the sunshine and
culture of America, and at the time he spoke, as nearly a gentleman as
a man can be in the neighborhood of the Forstmann and Huffmann mills. He
was reared by god fearing parents and school teachers, moral to the degree
that he was granted a passport to New Jersey, promised a crown of glory
when he goes to heaven.
<p>This product of America&#8217;s finest university and the lamkin in the valley
of infantile innocence burst forth in such language that the ears of the
sensitive cops were sent from pole to pole and all around the circumference.
These refined servants of the most high bosses have never been used to
such blasphemy. They have been standing on their head in the washbowl all
since, scrubbing and soaping and rubbing and grabbing and having one helluva
time to get the obscene and profane and vulgar impurities out of their
lily white ears that never before had come within radio distance of so
much as an exaggerated perturbance of a maiden aunt.
<p>Right in the hall, Ben Stolberg the very next day after Decoration day
so decorated the pure atmosphere of Garfield that that the police have
been wearing cotton and wool in their ears all since for fear of being
shocked by another outburst of horrible profanity. He is said to have said
the following sentence:
<p>&#8220;Organized labor is going to see to it that you come with your own union
and not with their goddam company union.&#8221; <p>Blasphemy! It soiled the ears of the cops. They grabbed him. Slammed
him into the hoosegow. Ran for their life to their washbowl to cleanse
their ears. Are there yet according to latest report.
<p>The outrage against these tender [saplings] in the vineyard of the bosses
must be avenged. That their immaculate cops should have been soiled to
such a degree is a crime unforgivable.
<p>Straightway they told the criminal after they arrested him, &#8220;What the
hell is America coming to when a goddam s…. of a b….. like you can get
up and talk that way? Why, I wouldn&#8217;t talk like that before my own mother.
Your goddam swearing sounds like hell.&#8221; <p>What will happen when this arch criminal gets before judge Baker is
yet to be learned. Can the judge stand the shock of the testimony? If there
is a funeral in New Jersey and a judge is laid to rest, it is another proof
that the outside agitators are a menace to the tranquility of humanity
and the serenity of the gentle bosses.

<p><b><font size=+1>Resolution on the Strike</font></b></center></p>

<p>The heroic struggle of the Passaic textile strikers now in its 19<sup>th</sup>
week, calls for the united and continuous support of all labor until victory
is assured.
<p>It is a struggle of the intensely exploited workers against the inhuman
conditions that oppress them. The fight of these workers is a fight of
all the workers in this country.
<p>The Passaic strikers fighting under the banner of the United Front Committee
of Textile Workers today constitute a valiant part of the workers vanguard
in this country. With their bodies they have borne the blows that have
been meant for the entire working class. We must protect these strikers.
<p>The Passaic strike marks a new chapter in the struggle of the worker
for a decent living wage. It marks a forward step in the organization of
the unorganized so badly needed. It gives a new impetus to the move for
unity of labor&#8217;s ranks not only in the textile industry but everywhere.
<p>The Passaic strikers have raised the slogan of the United Front of the
Workers against the united front of the bosses. And we, the delegates in
this &#8220;Support the Passaic Strike&#8221; Conference assembled together, hereby
resolve that we shall carry home with us this slogan and see to it that
all the means in our power, that a mighty united front of labor is created
for the support of the Passaic strikers, and for one union in the textile
industry.
<center>
<p>********************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>Resolution on Civil Liberties</font></b></center></p>

<p>Practically every liberty guaranteed in the Constitution of the United
States and the State of New Jersey has been denied the 16,000 textile strikers.
<p>Civil safeguards that together make up every keystone of our government
have been wiped out in the campaign of lawlessness and terrorization conducted
by the mill owners and their irresponsible and un-American agents.
<p>Workers attempting to picket as well as bystanders, have been brutally
clubbed and their heads split open by policemen&#8217;s clubs, even newspaper
men and photographers have been driven from the picket lines and their
property destroyed. The legal right to picket has been at times completely
wiped out and is even now seriously and unconstitutionally restricted.
<p>Strikers and their friends have been arrested and framed up without
warrant or cause and barbarously assaulted, both in and out of prison,
by the police Cossacks.
<p>The whole administration of justice in Passaic and vicinity has been
prostituted to the wishes of the mill owners. Judicial officials have acted
as though they were prosecuting agents of the mills in their futile efforts
to destroy the unity and solidarity of the textile workers and drive them
back to the mills.
<p>The right of peaceful assembly has also been seriously interfered with.
Halls have been closed by order of petty local tyrants and in some cases
still remain closed through the use threats and intimidation&#8217;s against
hall owners.
<p>In view of these clearly unconstitutional acts and practices, this conference
resolves to do all in its power to assist those organizations working to
retain, preserve and uphold the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the
United States during this orderly strike of textile workers.
<center>
<p>*******************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>Resolution on Defense</font></b></center></p>

<p>The textile mill owners in their efforts to break this strike of 16,000
workers have conducted a literal reign of terror through the local mayors,
police chiefs, sheriffs and other public officials. They have arrested
and indicted Albert Weisbord, the organizer of the United Front Conference,
Jack Rubenstein, and other strike leaders and picket captains; they have
arrested, clubbed and held under false charges, nearly 300 of the active
spirits of the struggle. Many of them have been brutally treated by the
police at the time of their arrest and during their incarceration. All
of them must have strong legal defense and protection against the lawless
and vindictive mill owners and their agents in public office.
<p>In addition to the textile strikers arrested when attempting to picket
and carry out their legal rights, several other citizens such as Norman
Thomas, Esther Lowell, Robert Wolf, Robert Dunn and others have been arrested,
thrown into jail, denied fair trials and finally released under outrageously
excessive bail in flagrant violation of constitutional guarantees. If indicted,
the very best of legal defense will be necessary in order to prevent them
being railroaded to prison for their work on behalf of the striking textile
workers.
<p>For the defense of the arrested strikers, their leaders and their sympathizers,
this conference pledges its complete and wholehearted support. It will
cooperate with the United Front Committee of Textile Strikers of Passaic
and vicinity, with the International Labor Defense and the American Civil
Liberties Union in making this defense work practical and effective. To
secure the release of all those under arrest, a strong, permanent and aggressive
defense movement must be built up to defend and protect them. The mill
owners must not be permitted to send Weisbord and the other valiant members
to prison for long terms&#8212;as punishment for their loyalty to the textile
workers.
<p>Therefore, we call upon all members to build up simultaneously with
the relief work, a united defense movement and we pledge ourselves even
after the strike is victoriously won to consider the victory incomplete
until we have secured the release of all those who have been the victim
of this reign of terror.

<p>&#8220;We in Branch 8 feel proud of having people in the Ranks of Trade Unionism

people being misled. Why, if it wasn&#8217;t for Sheriff Nimmo and his thugs
and the pay they&#8217;re getting from the bosses we would be back inside the
mills with our strong union long ago.
<p>Fellow workers, now is the time for us to open our eyes and see that
we stick to our leaders who have almost given their lives for us, and to
the other working people who are supporting us with their money to show
that they are fighting with us to a finish.
<p>Then when we enter the &#8220;Great Heaven"&#8212;the mills, [the] United Front

peaceful. And the mills then will be sanitary mills. May the great union
be strong forever and ever.

<p><br />We can&#8217;t win the strike because scabs work in the mills and they
take the bread from our mouths by scabbing. If we did not have scabs, then
we will win the strike. I wish the strike will be won because we could

<p>Dear fellow working women:
<p>Just a few words for us women working in those mills nights. I would
like to face any of those people, like Dr. McBride who say the conditions
are wonderful. Just let me tell him myself or I could face anybody and
tell them what a hell-hole it really is. Especially since the night superintendent
gave cut orders that we should not even eat by our machines, we had to
eat our piece of dry sandwich while he was away looking at other rooms.

<p>************************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+3>Now the Fight Is On!</font></b></center></p>

<p>Now the fight is on in real earnest! Not that the Passaic Textile Strike
has not had its earnest moments. The sound of policemen&#8217;s clubs on the
heads of men, women and children on strike, has been heard all over the
world. We have just had our BLOODY FRIDAY! Strikers walking home peacefully
from a hall meeting, were assaulted most brutally by a whiskey-maddened
police. They&#8217;re doling out whiskey now to keep up the courage of the arms
of the law!
<p>But the fight is on in real earnest now because the BOSSES HAVE ORGANIZED
THEIR UNION. Up to now the six big textile mills have followed an alone
strike policy. Of course, the same arms of law and order worked for all
the mills, yet, up to now each single mill laid claim to &#8220;its own workers&#8221; and itched to deal with &#8220;its workers&#8221; singly. One at a time.
<p>NOW THE TEXTILE BOSSES HAVE A UNION! They have decided to UNITE to beat
the Textile Strikers, and the first decision made by the NEW TEXTILE BOSSES
UNION was that the TEXTILE WORKERS SHALL NEVER HAVE A UNION!
<center>
<p><font size=+2>AND WE SAY THEY SHALL ! ! !</font></center></p>

<p>We say that the Textile Strikers SHALL HAVE A UNION to protect themselves
and their families and children. HOW DO YOU VOTE?
<p>We also say that the stool workers, oil workers, auto workers, all organized
workers SHOULD HAVE A UNION. That&#8217;s the point by the way. All the bosses
know that if the Textile Strikers got THEIR UNION, then the other millions
of unorganized workers will want one too.
<p>So, this is a fight for UNIONISM! And in this fight EVERY WORKER MUST
TAKE PART.
<center>
<p><font size=+2>YOU SEE&#8212;THE STRIKE IS NOT OVER!</font></center></p>

<p>Now the fight is on in real earnest. Now you must get down to the work
of helping to win the Textile Strike in real earnest. You may not get within
slugging distance of a Passaic policeman&#8217;s club, but you can encourage
the 16,000 textile strikers in their struggle by AIDING FINANCIALLY. Money

<p>The United Front Committee of Textile Workers and the Textile Strike
Bulletin bid all the delegates to the Amalgamation conference a hearty
welcome.
<p>You come into the territory of the great conflict between the textile
barons and the workers in the mills that has been going on for nineteen
weeks and that is still waging strong.
<p>The strikers are stronger than at any other period of the strike, and
have determined to win the strike all cost.
<p>You have come to a conference that is of the greatest importance. You
are taking up the question of organizing the unorganized in the entire
textile industry. The workers in this industry are sorely exploited. They
are looking with hopeful eyes to the delegates in this conference to provide
some means whereby the work of organization may proceed with all speed
so that there may be at least some degree of relief from the suffering
that the workers in the textile industry now endure.
<p>This conference will inspire us to even greater efforts and we pledge
our hearty cooperation with you in all your plans and efforts in behalf
of a union of all the textile workers.
<center>
<p>**********************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Company Union Exposed</font></b></center></p>

<p>One of the great services of this strike is the thorough exposure of
the company union.
<p>Never before has there been such light thrown upon the company union
in the textile industry as in this attempt by the bosses to coax the strikers
to accept this contraption in instead of their own union.
<p>When the bosses started the campaign to get the workers back and have
them join the company union, the workers in the Forstmann and Huffmannn
mills came forth with information on the workings of this company union
that shot it all to pieces. The thing now looks like a course sand sieve
that will not hold enough water to moisten a postage stamp.
<p>Pretty thin of Julius Forstmann to come and offer this hypocritical
instrument of the bosses to the workers and expect them to fall for it.
He had not figured on the nineteen weeks that the strikers have had in
the university of the strike. He did not figure on leadership of this strike.
It was a new one on him.
<p>Well by this time the company union is quite fit to be picked up and
crumbled into an ash can. The company union might be cremated, if it were
not for the brass that is in it with too much slag to melt.
<p>But the workers in Passaic and in the whole textile industry are well
through with the company union. It would be hard to resurrect the old corpse
again.
<p>Thank you, Mr. Julius Forstmann, for bringing it out so we could have
a look at it and forget it.
<center>
<p>***********************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>A New Reign of Terror</font></b></center></p>

<p>Now the Lodi police have broken loose&#8212;or rather the Lodi bosses.
<p>It is some time ago that the workers learned the fact that the bosses
control every act of the police. So that when the police were lined up
long before the picket line came along, the strikers knew that something
would happen.
<p>The assault was typical. The chief flew up and declared with much dignity
that &#8220;law and order&#8221; must be preserved, and then he and his Cossacks beat
down thirty innocent pickets.
<p>We have heard that formula before. It is framed and hung up on every
wall of the castles of the bosses. No well ordered police station is complete
without it. No chief and no cop is well educated unless he knows it by
heart. No newspaper office controlled by the bosses can get along without
it. No cub reporter can hold his job unless he is able to say it forward
and backward. No mayor or safety commissioner could draw a cent for their
campaign from the bosses if they had not already learned the &#8220;law and order&#8221; formula in their Sunday school. No sheriff or peanut judge would ever get
the backing of the barons if they could not harp on &#8220;law and order&#8221; like
a mendicant before a tenement house.
<p>Well, it is the parrot that parrots this &#8220;law and order&#8221; stuff, drilled
in the parlors of the bosses until it can say it as plainly as &#8220;Polly want
a cracker.&#8221; <p>And the funny part of it is that they think it is a brand new idea and
a brainy conception, a wholly original expression that only the greatest
mind and the most moral of mortals could possibly invent.
<p>&#8220;Law and order!&#8221; <p>Under that guise the whole gang of the bosses and the brainless parrots
of the master class try to hide themselves while they club the workers
and beat them into pulp. Under that guise they commit the most atrocious
crimes and get by with it. Under that guise the police can remove their
badges and their numbers so the victim and other witnesses may not be able
to prosecute the criminal cop. Under that guise the judge hands out the
most outrageous decisions and sentences.
<p>It&#8217;s a handy cover for the scoundrels and it serves the bosses mightily.
<p>So when the police break loose in their slugging and illegal beatings,
the workers know that it is another assault by the brutal bosses who are
so naive that they think the workers will ever return without protection
for themselves in the form of a union.
<p>No, the workers will seek protection against the brutalities of the
bosses. The union is their best protection.

<p>***********************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Relief Conference</font></b></center></p>

<p>It was good for the 200 delegates to the relief conference to see what
the strikers look like. It is almost impossible for the outside world to
realize how much energy and enthusiasm is bottled up in the Passaic district
until it is actually seen.
<p>These delegates were simply overwhelmed and declared that they had never
imagined that there was as much to this strike as they found when they
came to the conference.
<p>Others have had the same experience. Speakers have come to help in the
strike, to give inspiration. Invariably they have returned fully as much
helped by the inspiration the strikers have given them as they have been
able to impart to the strikers.
<p>This is a situation in which there is a wonderful process of reciprocity.
Labor in America has done a glorious relief work. The feeding of the thousands
of strikers every day has meant the success of the strike and will mean
full victory in the end.
<p>On the other hand, Labor in America has received in return such tremendous
inspiration that it will lift the organized and unorganized masses a to
a higher level than any other force during this period.
<p>In fact, the strikers have given full value for every loaf of bread
they have received. Both sides have gone forth to give and both sides have
given abundantly.
<p>The delegates went home with a new spirit, and from now on there will
be more relief than ever. The strikers saw the mighty force behind them
and will fight hard to make good.
<p>The conference was a mighty event for the workers of this country. It
was the beginning of bigger things to come. If bosses had been present
they would have had several sleepless nights since then.

<p>After seventeen weeks of bitter struggle against all the forces that
the fur manufactures could mobilize against the Furriers Union, 12,000
fur workers have come out Victorious.
<p>They have won a 40 hour week and 10&cent; increase in wages besides
other Trade Demands.
<p>The victory is especially significant because of the militant tactics
of the new leadership, under the splendid generalship of Ben Gold, the
general manager of the Joint Board.
<p>Like our own Weisbord, brother Gold incurred the hatred and hostility
of all the bosses and reactionary leaders, but had the affection and support
of the masses in the needle trades.
<p>The Passaic strikers can learn much from the tactics used in the furrier
strike, which prove that solidarity and determination always win against
all obstacles.
<p>Here in Passaic, let us take new courage and fresh determination and
score the next victory for the workers and lay the basis for the union
in the textile industry, as powerful and effective as the furriers have
built up in the needle trades.
<p>Workers who have no unions are forced to accept wage cuts and long hours,
while workers with a union and militant leadership win more wages and shorter
hours.
<p>This is the lesson of the fur workers strike.
<p>Fight for your union.

<p>Three women, Elizabeth Roma, Anna Kerstner and Mary Szanto, all of Lanza
Ave., Garfield, went out one evening to pay an educational visit to a scab.
They took the two children with them, little Nicholas Roma, four years
old, and Mary Kerstner, five. They took two men also, as protectors, for
anything can develop when you go to visit a scab. They reasoned with the
man, who had been working in the Forstmann and Huffmann Mill. They showed
him how he was taking the bread out of their children&#8217;s mouths, and robbing
his own children of their future. They got his promise that he would stop
scabbing. Then they left peacefully, early in the evening.
<p>Meanwhile, in the neighborhood got wind of the visit and called the
police court. The police were waiting on the corner when the group came
out. The cops arrested them, and for good measure&#8212;or to give themselves
exorcise&#8212;pulled in with them three men who were also standing harmlessly
at the corner.
<p>All night the five men remained packed in a cell. The kiddies and their
mothers, since no cell was vacant for them, wore away the long hours on
chairs in one of the rooms of the court house. With the morning, the babies
were hungry. But no food was forthcoming for children or grown people,
although it was two o&#8217;clock when they were finally released. One bottle
of milk was the only breakfast provided for the children.
<p>$1000 bail was fixed for each of the adults on a charge of threatening
to kill. Far from be frightened by this ridiculous charge, the women came
out ready to round up all the scabs of their neighborhood, and the children
will surely grow up into good class conscious fighters, with the early
education they got in jail.

<p>In speaking of the conference, Organizer Weisbord said: &#8220;The unity textile
conference that was held in New York City yesterday marks a definite step
forward in forming out of the many different unions in the textile industry,
one solid industrial union. Definite plans have been made to bring the
unions together again to work out a common scheme of action against the
employers. All sections of the conference were unanimous and the utmost
cordiality prevailed among the delegates of the various unions. Forty-three
delegates, representing fifteen unions and textile groupings were present.
The resolutions adopted called for the enthusiastic support of the Passaic
strike and denounced in no uncertain terms the company union schemes, called
for a fight for the abolition of child labor and pledged all the unions
present to a persistent campaign for organizing the resistance of the textile
workers to the horrible conditions now prevailing.
<p>&#8220;Two weeks from now the committee of ten that was elected to map out
further plans for a joint campaign to organize the unorganized in the textile
industry on a basis of a fight against the mill owners for decent living
and working conditions will meet. Albert Weisbord, the leader of the Passaic
strike, is a member of this committee, and will be present at all of its
meetings.
<p>&#8220;The results of this conference may be very far reaching, for if the
plans that were made are successful, it will mean that all of the independent
textile unions outside of the American Federation of Labor will be banded
together for the first time in a close knit organization to fight the mill
owners.

is as follows:
<p>&#8220;The heroic strike of our fellow workers in Passaic now in its 19<sup>th</sup>
week, calls for the united and continuous support by all textile unions
until victory is assured.
<p>&#8220;It is a struggle against the inhuman conditions which are general throughout
the textile industry. The fight of our fellow-workers of Passaic is a fight
of every textile worker in America.
<p>&#8220;The Passaic strikers fighting under the banner of the United Front
Committee of Textile Workers today constitute a valiant part of the workers
vanguard in this country. With their own bodies they have borne the blows
that have been meant for us also.
<p>&#8220;The Passaic strike marks a new chapter in the struggle of the workers
for a decent living wage. It marks a forward step in the organization of
the unorganized so badly needed. It gives a new impetus to the move for
unity of labor&#8217;s ranks in the textile industry.
<p>&#8220;The Passaic strikers have raised the slogan of the united front of
the workers against the united front of the bosses. And we the delegates
assembled together at this unity conference called by the Federated Textile
Unions solemnly pledge our fullest support for the Passaic Strike and for
one union in the textile industry.&#8221; <center>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Company Union</font></b></center></p>

<p>The menace of the &#8220;company union&#8221; was dealt with in the following resolution,
also carried unanimously.
<p>&#8220;Whereas in many textile mills there are company unions, known variously
as Employees Representation Plans, etc., etc.
<p>&#8220;Whereas the purpose of the employers in establishing such organizations
is to facilitate the speeding up of the workers, and to prevent the growth
of real true unionism in the textile industry.
<p>&#8220;Whereas in actual practice these company unions exert a demoralizing
effect upon the workers understanding and a destructive effect upon their
struggle for better conditions, therefore be it
<p>&#8220;Resolved that this conference and the unions here assembled emphatically
condemn company unionism as directly harmful to the workers interests,
and pledge themselves to carry on an aggressive fight against company unionism
and for the establishment of genuine labor unionism in the textile industry.&#8221; <center>
<p><b><font size=+1>Child Labor</font></b></center></p>

<p>A resolution on child labor was as follows:
<p>&#8220;Whereas in the textile industry there are employed a very large number
of child laborers under the age of 16 and
<p>&#8220;Whereas the employment of children impairs their health and general
development and does not give these children a chance to grow up healthy,
and
<p>&#8220;Whereas the employment of children to do the tasks of the adult workers
for a most miserably low wage tends to lower the standard of living of
all the workers in the particular industry, therefore be it
<p>&#8220;Resolved that this conference of the textile workers representatives
go on record against the employment of children in industry, in particular,
the textile industry, to start an energetic campaign for the abolition
of child labor.&#8221; <p>The fourth resolution passed unanimously by the conference, was on the
general condition of the industry. It was as follows:
<p>&#8220;The present conditions prevailing throughout the textile industry challenges
the attention of all organized labor and especially of the leaders of the
organized textile workers in America.
<p>&#8220;The most superficial survey of the conditions under which the million
textile operatives suffer are general in every branch of the industry.
<p>&#8220;The wages paid in this highly protected industry have been notoriously
below the subsistence level and on top of this the mill owners have been
engaged in a wage slashing campaign in which the already low wages have
been reduced from twenty to forty percent in the last two years.
<p>&#8220;Unemployment and half-time work has been the rule and the impoverishment
of the textile workers has been still further increased by this means and
they have been compelled to accept increasingly bad conditions of work
from this cause.
<p>&#8220;The introduction of the multiple loom system, especially in the cotton
mills, the increase in the number of looms in every branch of the industry
required the speeding up and efficiency systems introduced in all departments
of every branch of the textile industry still further increase the exploitation
of the mill workers.
<p>&#8220;The use of child labor prevalent in the Southern mills and the intense
exploitation of the workers in the mills of the South, many of which are
owned and operated by the same companies controlling large corporations
in the Northern mills operate to still further reduce the already low standard
of living of all the textile workers.
<p>&#8220;In most of the mills, systems of fines and docking are prevalent and
the textile workers suffer under a multitude of petty abuses. The system
of fines and docking filch annually hundreds of thousands of dollars from
the pockets of the textile workers.
<p>&#8220;Long hours of labor at intense speed, running from forty-eight to seventy
hours per week sap the vitality of the textile workers in all textile centers
and ruin the health of the women workers.
<p>&#8220;Therefore we, the delegates representing our organizations at this
Conference of Textile Workers, this 5<sup>th</sup> day of June, 1926, pledge
ourselves to do all in our power to organize the unorganized textile workers
in every branch of the industry, as by this means and by this means alone
can these bad conditions be remedied and the whole standard of living in
the industry raised and improved. Only by consolidating all the organized
forces and carrying on a persistent campaign for organizing the resistance
of the workers to these conditions can we expect any permanent improvement
and to this end we pledge ourselves and our organizations to give moral,
financial and collective support to this program.&#8221; <center>

<p><b><font size=+1>A Victim Of &#8220;Bloody Friday&#8221;</font></b></center></p>

<p>When she came in to the office we were all startled. Her face was so
gray and lined and sick&#8212;she looked as if she might fall to pieces any
moment. She kept twisting her hands together nervously and she seemed very
frightened.
<p>Yes, she had been sick, she said. For two weeks she had been &#8220;on the
bed.&#8221; Her husband had thought she would die, and if it hadn&#8217;t been for
the neighbors coming in she didn&#8217;t know how she could have done for the
kids. What was her matter? She had been clubbed on &#8220;Bloody Friday.
<p>&#8220;I was going along the street from Belmont Park Hall. I was going to
march, then picket Forstmann-Huffmann on my way home. We were nearly there
when I seen a cop go up and hit a woman in front of me. Everybody was hollering
and booing after that and the cops began to chase the people. I couldn&#8217;t
run so fast so they caught me and punched me and hit me awful.&#8221; The big
gray eyes dilate with fear and the hands twitch nervously.
<p>&#8220;Were you hollering, too?&#8221; <p>&#8220;No, I wasn&#8217;t ever hollering. I just couldn&#8217;t run fast enough, so they
got me and hit me and then took me off to jail. My husband come and got
me out because I got small kids, and the next day I was too sick to stay
in the court. The judge took one look at me and says, &#8220;Go home,&#8221; and they
ain&#8217;t ever called me to come back.&#8221; <p>&#8220;What was it made you so sick&#8212;just the beating?&#8221; <p>&#8220;Oh lady,&#8221; and now the gray eyes brimmed over. &#8220;All that punching and
hitting they gave me&#8212;I&#8217;ve lost my little baby,&#8221; and the bereft mother
burst into tears, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got five others, but the youngest is three now,
and I wanted a tiny one again.&#8221; <p>So &#8220;Bloody Friday&#8221; still goes on, taking its toll of the workers, of
the little children, of the unborn. This mother and other mothers, how
can they forget these outrages which the bosses and their henchmen are
bringing to them and their children? How can the workers of America forget
such scenes, or let these heroic people suffer longer? The struggles must
be won once and for all, so that never again in Passaic can a policeman
club down and kill the unborn child of a worker.

<p><b><font size=+1>Twenty Thousand Strikers and Friends Turn Out for Monster
Picnic</font></b></center></p>

<p>As the glorious sun burst through the clouds on Sunday, June 6<sup>th,</sup>
after several rainy days, so did the strikers spirits brighten up and their
courage revive at the all day picnic held at Rochelle Park. The committee
had talked to the Weather Man the week before, and he had disappointed
them. This time Weisbord himself put in a word, and as he has a pull there
as well as in Passaic, we got a most perfect day.
<p>Early in the morning in the glowing sunshine the buses started out from
Belmont Hall. Trip after trip they made and crowd after crowd of strikers
started out to hike, in a long joyful picnic picket-line, and still the
crowds kept coming. If there were a thousand people at that picnic Sunday
there were twenty thousand, all enjoying the outing and its program to
the full.
<p>Sports took up the morning. The winners of the different events were
as follows:
<br />25 yard dash:&#8212;Wanda Jackowski and William Scoka.
<br />100 yard dash&#8212;Mamie Sandusky and Louis Obsuth.
<br />Potato race&#8212;Marguerite Toth and Steve Obsuth.
<br />Sack Race&#8212;Mamie Sandusky and Louis Obsuth.
<br />Tug of war&#8212;Joe Toth, John Vanyo, Joe Vanyo, Louis Obsuth, Steve
Zakopchan and Prudsoce Brio.
<p>In the afternoon a baseball game came off between the Lodi Independents
and the Philadelphia Giants. Free lunch consisting of cake, milk and sandwiches
was served to the children. Later, there was a program consisting of singing
by the Ukrainian Choir of Passaic, playing by the Silvertone Orchestra,
and recitations and songs by the Pioneers of New York.
<p>The climax of the day came at six o&#8217;clock when the magic news flew around
the grounds that Weisbord was present. He came fresh from the Amalgamation
Conference in New York and gave the report of the hopeful outcome of that
conference. Dancing on the ground, in the light of the setting sun, wound
up the day.
<p>Back went the trucks with their loads, one after another. Sunburned,
tired with the pleasant tiredness of a day in the open air, the strikers
went back as they had come, singing and cheering. If any had been a bit
blue, if any had felt that the strike was lasting long and were getting
tired, they came back from the picnic with spirits fresh and courage high.
They have girded up their loins and are ready for the fight, once more
again. The picnic will long be remembered as one of the happy events of
the strike.

<p><b><font size=+1>Part-Time And Earnings</font></b></center></p>

<p>In contrast to the plight of the textile workers, the building trades
are well organized, and by virtue of their bargaining power, bricklayers
receive $12 a day. This may seem to be an excessive wage, but brick laying
is a part time industry and the annual earnings of the brick layers are
not excessive when it is considered that they and their families must be
tided over the idle days as well as work days.
<p>&#8220;The terrible industry is also a part time industry but the highest
wage in the Passaic mills for the highest skilled workers prior to the
cut was only 55 cents an hour. By working full time (48 hours a week prior
to the cut, 55 hours a week since the 10 per cent cut), the highest paid
wage earner in the Passaic mills would receive only $26. 40; and by working
full time every one of the 52 weeks of the year, his annual earnings would
be only $1,372.80. At part time the highest paid wage earners receive much
less than this, and the lower paid workers still less than they.&#8221; <p>W. Jett Lauck

<p><b><font size=+1>Workers Can Learn English Now</font></b></center></p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, I want to learn English,&#8221; the Hungarian striker explained, laboriously
picking his words, &#8220;I was in Italy I army, one year. I learn Italian beautiful.
Here …….&#8221; He spread his hands in a hopeless gesture. &#8220;I&#8217;m in America five
years, all I learn is Polish. I work five years in Botany mill, all Polish
people around me, so I learn Polish. Only since the strike, I begin to
learn a little bit English.&#8221; <p>Yes, it took the strike to teach the workers English, as well as many
other things. The bosses never wanted them to learn it, and for very good
reasons. The knowledge would unite them as one people, instead of separating
them into groups of Polish, Hungarian and Italian workers, each one hating
the other. People separated are not organized, which would serve the bosses
purpose very well.
<p>Furthermore, the worker who does not know the language of the country
can be tricked. He can be fooled by the boss who will tell him things he
does not understand, meanwhile putting something over on him.
<p>These textile bosses opposed any attempt to teach the workers English,
even setting spies to follow teachers who have made such attempts. The
Union will see to it that the workers who have spent from five to twenty
years in this country will have the opportunity to learn English.
<p>Just think of those women in Passaic, especially the ones who don&#8217;t
know how to speak English. They were afraid of the bosses shadow and no
wonder, because when the husband brings in only $24 a week with seven children,
the wife has to slave in the mills and stand for all kinds of yelling so
as not to lose her dear &#8220;position&#8221; in the great heaven. (I would rather
call it a hell-hole or prison).
<p>One night a woman went to get herself a bottle of water and a sandwich
and started to eat it, just as the boss came along. When he saw the lady
eating, just because she was leaning against her machine he started to
yell so you could hear it from one end of the room to the other.
<p>It&#8217;s because we weren&#8217;t organized and had no union to protect us that
we had stand such criminal insults from the bosses. So lets stick together
and stand firm. I appeal to you poor working ladies who don&#8217;t know how
to talk in American.

directly or indirectly helps the bosses, and keeps the workers from organizing
a real union. The Shop Council is a scab organization. It O.K.&#8217;s all the

<p>The national conference of Textile workers unions branded company unionism
in a resolution adopted unanimously as <em>"harmful to the workers interests&#8221;</em>
and as a trick <em>"to facilitate the speeding up of the workers and to
prevent the growth of real trade unionism in the textile industry.&#8221;</em>
<p>The conference called by the Federation of Textile workers which includes
the American Federation of Textile Operatives, pledged itself <em>"to carry
on an aggressive fight against company unionism and for the establishment
of genuine labor unionism in the textile industry.&#8221;</em>
<p>A typical company union exists in the Pacific mills of Lawrence under
the name of &#8216;Shop Council.&#8217; The leaders of this company union also parade
around as the leaders of a textile workers union. They declare that they
will affiliate with the A. F. T O. But the A. F. T. O. repudiates Company
unionism. The American Federation of Textile Operatives voted through its
delegates at the National Conference for the resolution condemning Company
unions, and pledged itself to fight the company union.
<p>The leaders of the shop council will have to look elsewhere for affiliation.
They are already affiliated with the Bosses. No workers union or organization
will tolerate company union agents in its ranks. <em>You can&#8217;t feed from

<p>The American Woolen Co. announces that they are going to close down
for their annual 10-day vacation in July. How kind the bosses are to us,
and how grateful we are to them. They don&#8217;t want us to toil in the hot
summer days. They want to give us workers a rest, to enjoy nature and the
beautiful summertime.
<p>Will the bosses perhaps advise us what to do with our time? Ten whole
days! Just imagine! Where should we go? To Canada? To the seashore? Perhaps
to Italy or Paris? The bosses know where to spend a vacation, get the real
stuff and have a &#8216;helluva&#8217; time. They spend 90 per cent of our money and
their time there. They know. Won&#8217;t they please tell us? Why not post suggestions
on the bulletin boards or on the walls in the mills the same as they did
with wage cuts?
<p>Or did the bosses ever consider what we are going to eat during our
grand vacation? Nature surely is wonderful. Sunlight is good for the health.
Did it ever occur to our bosses that nature demands also food? Did they
make any provisions for our stomachs when they give us our vacation? And
then again the bosses evidently want us to have a <em>complete vacation
--- our stomachs included</em>. We have been working 4 and 3 days a week
for months. We have had lots of spare time to eat enough to last all year.

<p>We the weavers of the Edward Bloom Co. have been on strike for the past
seven weeks. The reason for the strike was a wage cut of Twenty-five per
cent. For the first five weeks the Bloom mill was practically shut down
but in the last part of the sixth week he tried to break the strike by
hiring scabs. He failed in the attempt. The night before the scabs were
going in to work, the foreman went to some of the strikers houses and told
them that the strike was over and that they should come back to work. When
the strike committee heard of this, they went around to all the weavers
and told them to all be on picket line the next morning. The next morning
there were about 50 of us on the picket line and we stopped all but three
professional scabs. Mr. Bloom had policemen to protect the scabs all day
long. If we keep up the good work we&#8217;ll win the strike soon.

<p>The big women&#8217;s meeting that was held one evening recently was like
a big cross section of the strike. A crowded hall, women of all ages, old
women with shawls or kerchiefs over their heads, young girls, mothers with
babies in their arms, you learn the very heart of the strike of Passaic
at such a meeting.
<p>There is strength in these women and power. They are no passive audience
who sit like jugs and have the words of the speakers poured into them.
They take part in the meeting. There is a response and approval that makes
it a live thing. You can see them thinking together and getting ready to
act together.
<p>The many weeks of strike has added something in them. They come out
from the [drudgery] of the mill and home into the picket line and hall
where they were fighting together, for the women knew what they were fighting
for, for their faces showed it. Animating these women is a calm determination
to win the strike.
<p>Weisbord appears, applause, more applause, applause that will not stop.
There are hundreds of faces lighted up. Cheers from the young girls. At
last he has a chance to speak. It is about the women after all.
<p>Rows upon rows of women, the packed hall full of women have welded themselves
together in a fighting mass that means nothing short of strength.
<p>This evening is only another step in the lessons on unionism that they
have been learning from the strike, another expression of solidarity. A
meeting like this could not have been held in a textile town a few years
ago. Here are women of all races listening to speakers in English. Women
have come out of their homes to meet together for a high purpose. The cry
has been always before, you cannot organize the women.

<p><b><font size=+1>Denial Of Collective Bargaining</font></b></center></p>

<p>&#8220;For many years it has been the policy of these German mill owners to
employ immigrant labor. Before the last immigration Act was passed, agents
were sent to Ellis Island with instructions to secure as great a diversity
of nationalities as possible. This was for the purpose of making it more
difficult for the employees to become organized. National animosities and
antipathies were accentuated and encouraged, and rivalry as between nationalities
was encouraged as an expedient for more intensive production schedules.
<p>&#8220;The individual is powerless to negotiate for higher wages, and until
he and his fellows become organized, and thus enabled to bargain collectively,
he is at the mercy of the mill manager, and must take whatever wages and
working conditions the mill manager chooses to force upon him.&#8221; <p>W. Jett Lauck.

<p><b><font size=+1>Health Hazards In The Textile Industry</font></b></center></p>

<p>Infant mortality in Passaic is 43 to 52 per cent greater than in the

10 to 19 years (period of adolescence) is [28] per cent greater than in
the rest of the state.
<p>&#8220;Passaic is a textile center. The work in the textile mills is done
indoors in hot steam filled rooms, or in rooms filled with dirty disease
laden dust, or in the presence of strong chemicals and dyes of various
kind. The combination of these technical conditions with the inadequate
standard of living forced upon the workers by the low wages paid and with
the long hours of work speeded up to a high degree of efficiency saps the
strength and resistance of the workers to such an extent that they readily
fall as victims of such diseases as tuberculosis, wool sorters disease,
(anthrax), cancer, digestive disorders, anemia, etc.&#8221; <center>

<p>I am a worker of the United Piece and Dye Works. The conditions were

any fresh air nor fresh food. I didn&#8217;t have any strength. I felt ill all

all. I came out on strike and since I came out I get plenty of fresh air
and plenty of sunshine. I get clothes and shoes for myself.
<p>I learned a great deal about the bosses. They don&#8217;t care at all about
the workers, for if they did they would give them a living wage and realize
that the workers want to be organized into a union, and not a company union
either.
<p>We are going to stick together and listen to our leader Weisbord. I
have studied the history of the bosses, and I know how they used to treat
the slaves in olden times. But now they can&#8217;t fool them any more, I know,
because although I am a colored worker I stick together with the white
workers because I see that all workers slave alike. The bosses tried all
kinds of tricks to break us, but instead they united us. Fellow workers,
stick together! White or colored, Italian or Polish!

<p>The affidavits that all the strikers filled out showed an average wage
of $23 before the wage cut and $17.18 after the wage cut. This is for all
the weavers regardless their age and the number of looms they ran. Of course
a young, less experienced weaver running only three looms made a good deal
less. Fifteen dollars a week is about all an average young weaver could
make after the wage cut.
<p>Besides receiving less pay the young, less experienced weavers, suffer
most from the abuse of the straw bosses, for they have some regard for
the skilled weaver, but they know the young weaver is completely at their
mercy on account of his inexperience.
<p>The Union will put an end to this. Besides raising the pay of the young
weavers along with the adults, it will be a protection for the younger
weavers from the insults and abuse of the bosses. The Union is the only
thing that will force the bosses and even Mr. Bloom himself to treat the
workers like men and women and not like lugs. When the foremen and the
super knows that he will have to account for any insult to the Union, he
will learn to become a gentleman.
<p>Young weaver, you see you have more to gain. Get into the fight for
the Union and for a decent wage.

<p>One day in the street by the Passaic Worsted Spinning Mill were some
policemen standing on the corner. There were some children also, jumping
rope. Two policemen came along and started to turn the rope, and the children
were jumping. After a while the cops gave the children some pennies and
said they should put two fingers up and say they would never call scabs.
Our kids were too wise for them and said, &#8220;Nothing doing, we&#8217;ll call dirty
rotten scab whenever we see one!&#8221; <p>Mrs. Bresnac.

<p>In the early stages of the strike the mill owners thought they could
force the strikers back to work by starving them, and especially their
children. They were sadly mistaken as the past weeks of the struggle have
proven to everyone who take facts as they are.
<p>The United Front Committee, through its relief stores and especially
the children&#8217;s kitchens shall feed the children of the strikers as long
as is necessary in order that the strike may be won and the strong textile
union established here in Passaic. It gives one a real sense of working
class spirit to see the hundreds of children fed daily at the kitchen and
enjoying a real wholesome meal for the first time in their lives.
<p>Some of the children, whose parents slaved all their lives in the mills
making the textile masters wealthier and wealthier all the time, have never
had a taste till now of milk or any other food that is nutritious and makes
for healthy men and woman. The children that eat in these kitchens realize
what this union means to them and will grow up with a spirit of class consciousness
and a desire to fight for the working class. Stand firm! Fight until you
win! One Big Union for all textile workers!

<p><b><font size=+1>The Young Fellow Got His Ticket</font></b></center></p>

<p>Tickets were being given out for this concert. A big audience of woman
filed in orderly fashion before the platform. Organizer Weisbord held out
the tickets to the hands that were raised for them. Tranquil marching women
held up their hands to get tickets for the Sunday night concert. Opera
singers were coming from New York, also well known musicians.
<p>In front of the women fluttered a lean, imperative hand, a hand that
demanded, a hand that had to have a ticket. The boy who held his hand up
with his imperative gesture was blonde and under-nourished and he was wise
and he knew what he wanted, he knew he had to have a ticket. It was not
a children&#8217;s concert. Children only got tickets if there were some left
over.
<p>The little boy stood there valiant, upright, his outstretched hand voicing
his resolve. There was strength in that boy, and there was power in his
persistence. It was as if in his lean body he possessed all the will and
passion of the mill workers starved children to do away with the conditions
that have made them starved.
<p>The women moved slowly and calmly&#8212;an endless file taking their turns
with discipline.
<p>The little boy stood by the edge of the platform with his outstretched
gaping hand. Not once did he stop his mute demand while the large audience
walked past in their slow fashion. That boy knew how to stick, he knew
how to get what he wanted and thin as he was, he knew how to use all the
force that was in him. It was as if this ticket was a ticket that meant
life and death. The last woman walked slowly past. The little flock of
children crowded up. His hand darted up in triumph and he went off with
his ticket of paper, the bit of paper that meant he would hear the music
next Sunday night, the bit of paper that meant also that he was made of
the stuff of the mill workers children that win strikes.

<p><b><font size=+1>"Shame,&#8221; Says Writer of Passaic</font></b>
<p>Spirit of Strikers is Admirable, Dr. Johnson Says; Upbraids New Jersey
Police.
<br />By Mercer Green Johnston</center></p>

<p>Last Saturday I took a &#8220;look see&#8221; at the textile strike situation in
and around Passaic.
<p>This remarkable strike now is in its 18<sup>th</sup> week and, like
Johnny Walker, going strong.
<p>Almost from the beginning I have been thinking I ought to take a look
in on it. During the Spanish War Mr. Dooley declared he had &#8220;fought, bled
and died in every spot in Cuba.&#8221; I feel somewhat that way about New Jersey.
Especially of the region round about Newark in which Passaic, Garfield,
Clifton, Paterson, and other mill towns are situated. My nostrils are familiar
with its every smell. And my back is not unfamiliar with the stripes that
come from protesting against those smells. Even those antisocial smells
that literally massacre innocents in such wholesale fashion as to reduce
Herod from the rank of a red tyrant to that of a pink piker.
<p>The death rate of children among the mill folk of Passaic and vicinity
is 50 per cent greater than elsewhere in New Jersey!
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a damned shame.&#8221; <p>That&#8217;s a quotation. A quotation from a meaty little book I keep close
at hand, called &#8220;Human Justice for Those at the Bottom: An Appeal to Those
at the Top.&#8221; Here is the context of quotation:
<p>&#8220;There is a type of Englishman who, when moved to a certain point of
indignation at witnessing or hearing of a situation of shameful injustice
would sometimes give utterance to his feelings and say: &#8216;It&#8217;s a damned
shame.&#8217;
<p>&#8220;And very rarely would it happen that the man whose feelings found expression
in such words would not proceed to action. Now this is the point of feeling
to which all of us should be moved by the contemplation of the shamefully
unjust condition of this million at the bottom.&#8221; <p>The million the author had in mind were in England. The million I have
in mind at the moment are in America. In the textile industry. One of the
prodigious predatory industrial infants protected by our tariff from foreign
competition and given perfectly free hand to fleece the American consumer
and the American wage-earner.
<p>Of this overworked and underfed million, a valiant vanguard, 16,000
strong, driven to desperation by the starvation wages of mill owners who
have fattened fabulously on the faithful labor of their fingers, are on
strike. Incidentally, the biggest of these mill owners are foreigners,
who are reaping the rich rewards of the American tariff while warring against
American standards of living. Yes, coining the very bodies and souls of
American workers into stupendous profits on alien capital!
<p>Against these strikers are arrayed upwards of $30,000,000 of mill capital,
plus all the other wealth of Passaic and vicinity worth mentioning, which
immediately lined up with the $30,000,000, plus the majesty of the state
of New Jersey, (famous for &#8220;Jersey Justice") as represented by the mayors
of Passaic, Garfield and Clifton, the chief of police and police magistrate
of Passaic, the sheriff of Bergen County, Gov. Moore, and Sens. Edge and
Edwards, all of whom function as if they were under such peculiar obligations
to the $30,000,000, as to wipe out all human obligations.
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a damned shame.&#8221; <p>Somehow that quotation kept running through my mind all day last Saturday.
And the longer it ran the hotter it got. Once I am afraid I blurted it
out loud. Loud enough for 3,000 friendly ears to hear. My spiritual breakbands
must have burnt out. Even asbestos might have gone to pieces under the
grueling test.
<p>Early in the day the quotation popped into my mind. I was in one of
the two kitchens in which a thousand hungry children are given a meal a
day. Before me, and close enough to be touched, were children of which
any nation ought to be proud. Somewhat undersized, somewhat underfed, but
with clean, smiling faces, snappy eyes, and bubbling spirits. I suppressed
the quotation, but in doing so I forgot to watch my eyes. When I became
aware of them again they were moist. A woman near me was crying.
<p>You see, the very lives of these children&#8212;more precious really,
even from a national point of view, than swollen dividends&#8212;were at
stake! Absolutely without reason, absolutely contrary to good public morals,
death was playing havoc among them. And neither the mayor of Passaic, nor
the governor of New Jersey, nor either of the U. S. senators of the state,
cared a continental. Poor souls! Pitifully poor. If Christians, not up
on their Gospels (Matt. 18:10), perhaps. Or wanting in imagination. Or
living in the black shadow of the $30,000,000, and in perpetual obedience
to it.
<p>The spirit of the children of these strikers is marvelous. Nothing downs
them. Nothing daunts them. I saw chalked in childish hand on a mill wall:
"Cops are devils.&#8221; These kids have much right to believe that. Again and
again they have seen the police behave with all the brutality of the Czarist
Cossack. The New York World ran a cartoon showing Uncle Sam taking down
the sign &#8220;Bergen County,&#8221; and substituting another, reading &#8220;Siberia.&#8221; <p><em>It may be a little unfair to the decenter sort of devils to put them
on a par with the Passaic police in their assaults on women and children.
But whether &#8220;devils&#8221; or not, the cops have not been able to cow the kids.
The other night they picketed chief Zober&#8217;s house and sang him songs about
Cossacks of their own composing, with a few snappy significant yells thrown
in to dispel any lingering doubt he might have to as how he and his band
of ruffians stand with them.</em>
<p>The spirit of the strikers themselves, of all ages and both sexes, from
those in their teens on up to their parents and their grandparents, is
most remarkable. I have never seen anything like it in all my relations
with the labor movement.
<p>It is more like the buoyant spirit that animated the early Christians
than anything I have ever come in contact with. They are literally smiling
through this strike. I had thought my visit to Passaic would be depressing.
Quite the contrary. I came away with the feeling that I had passed through
"miles and miles of smiles and smiles&#8221; on fearless faces. Faces that looked
good to me.
<p>The great meeting in Kantors Auditorium was one of the most inspiring
I ever attended. Here gathered some 1,500 local strikers and representatives
from Boston and Chicago, Springfield and Detroit, Rochester and Baltimore,
and a couple of hundred places between, who brought words of encouragement
from half a million friends to the 16,000 men and women on strike. For
half an hour before the meeting got down to serious talk and business there
was cheering and singing that would have done credit to any college gathering.
<p><em>The yells were full of pep. The songs set to good old tunes like
"John Brown&#8217;s Body,&#8221; &#8220;Hold the Fort,&#8221; &#8220;Revive Us Again,&#8221; and such, and
joined in by girls and boys, mothers and fathers, and grandmothers and
grandfathers that Franz Hals would have delighted to paint, gave me an
inspiring vision of an awakening labor movement in America that would play
a sorely needed and vital part in the shaping of American history in the
years just ahead of us.</em>
<p>The Passaic strikers have faced, and are facing, great odds. But through
18 long weeks they have carried on magnificently. Not for a moment have
they weakened. The strike is still a hundred per cent strike.
<p>Deprived of every right guaranteed by state and national constitutions,
they patiently bided their time. Threatened with death by those whose sworn
duty it was to protect them in their rights, they smiled philosophically.
Possibly some of them winked and asked; &#8220;O death, where is thy sting-aling-ling?&#8221; <p>What is to become of the final outcome of this just and splendidly orderly
and [competently] managed strike? The strikers say they will win. And they
believe what they say. Their faith in their cause and in their leader,
Albert Weisbord, know no bounds.
<p>I heard this young Jew acclaimed as another young Jew was acclaimed
some 2000 years ago for somewhat similar reasons. Compassion on the unshepherded
multitude coupled with the modest and seeming miraculous satisfaction of
their hunger.
<p><em>And I heard this young Jew declare that the strikers would rather
die than return to the mills under the old conditions or anything like
them, and the declaration greeted with thunderous applause from hardy hands.</em>
<p>I believe with all my heart that this strike should succeed. I believe
that if properly supported by organized labor and persons of liberal views
as it certainly ought to be it will succeed. I believe that these strikers
can be defeated only by crushing their splendid spirits.
<p>It may be possible to do that, not by bullying or beating or jailing
them, but by starvation. But if that is done, the loss to the whole labor
movement, indeed to our whole country, will be enormous. The spirit I saw
manifested in these textile workers is essential to the future of a free
America. To sabotage it, as the petty politicians of New Jersey are sabotaging
it, is suicidal. These 16,000 workers are worth their weight in gold. To
destroy them while we are celebrating the sesquicentennial of American
independence would be national lunacy.&#8212;<em>From the Baltimore Daily
Post.</em>

<p><b><font size=+1>Women Workers Suffer Most</font></b>
<br />By Irving Freiman</center></p>

<p>Millions of young girls and women are employed in the mills, farms,
stores, and factories, of America. They are engaged in every kind of work
from domestic service to the manufacture of all kinds and all sorts of
commodities. The lack of laws protecting women employed in industry is
one of the greatest indictments against our civilization. The women are
the mothers of the nation and if they are permitted to be exploited indiscriminately
and their health is undermined due to a lack of sanitary health laws, then
the future of the nation is very black.
<p>A number of attempts have been made to safeguard women, especially in
respect to their family functions by some states in the Union. In Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Missouri, Vermont and New Jersey there are laws on the statute
books prohibiting them to work from two to six weeks before childbirth.
But these laws lack teeth in them and they are grossly violated especially
in those industries where there is no union organized to protect the women
employed in the mills.
<p>Some states have no night work for women laws similar to the law in
the state of New Jersey that prohibits women to work from the hours of
ten P. M. to 6 A. M. These laws are never enforced however where the women
are not organized or no union exists; the employers have a free play to
violate these laws as they please and the state departments of labor rarely
have the power to enforce these laws. We have one outstanding example of
this fact. In the state of New Jersey a law was passed in 1923 to go into
effect 1925 that no women could be employed in laundries, bakeries and
factories from 10 P. M. to 6 A. M. This law was never enforced by the Textile
Operators of Passaic.
<p>The Passaic Textile Operators asked for extension of two years time
before the law became operative. The law was amended accordingly, with
the understanding that they would obey it. When Jan, 1925 arrived, the
Passaic Textile Operators and mill owners regarded the law as a scrap of
paper. They have continued to work women at night without any interference
on the part of the law. Consequently the women working in the textile industry
of New Jersey under such miserable and exhausting conditions have an infant
death rate under one year of age 53% higher than anywhere else in the state.
<p>Fellow workers, have you stopped to realize what will become of us if
such conditions are to continue? Do you realize what a great menace women
labor means? Have you asked yourself why so many women, both mothers and
young girls are employed in industry? Most mothers are forced to work because
the wage their husband earns is too small to provide for his family. Young
women and girls are employed because they are a cheap source of labor to
be used against the union workers in times of strikes and in normal times.
<p>Sisters in industry, it is about time we saw the handwriting on the
wall and proceed to organize ourselves and fight shoulder to shoulder with
our brothers and husbands for better and higher standards of living. Now
is the time when wage cuts are the order, long hours of toil is a common
thing, for us to join the ranks of the organized trade union workers of
the country. Unorganized women everywhere organize, you have nothing to
lose but your chains!

<p><b><font size=+1>The Children&#8217;s Kitchens and How They Are Conducted</font></b></center></p>

<p>There are now two children&#8217;s kitchens in Passaic, one at 25 Dayton Avenue,
and the other at 170 Third Street. The Dayton Avenue one feeds 58 children
at one time, and the other, seventy-two. There are generally four or five
shifts a day. Between the two places, about a thousand different children
are being fed six days a week. The serving of the dinner begins at about
3:30, when the children come out of school. The meals are made as full
and nourishing as possible, the menu including soup, stew, salads, prunes,
applesauce, etc. Soup is the most popular dish, though these children are
glad even to get bread. A cup of milk is given to each child. For some
of them this is the first chance in their lives to drink milk.
<p>The work is done by the women of the Workingwomen&#8217;s and Housewives Councils,
who elect committees for every day. They are helped in the afternoon when
there is a rush of work in serving the children, by women strikers.
<p>The children receive a weekly meal ticket, which is punched for every
meal and exchanged at the end of the week. It goes without saying that
scabs children are branded and get no food in the kitchens.
<p>The kitchens are managed by an Executive Committee of which Leona Smith
is Chairman, and which is composed of three delegates elected from each
of the Councils, with two representatives of the children. This Committee
meets regularly once a week to conduct the business both kitchens. There
are also a buying and a menu committee.
<p>Funds a collected by the different branches of the United Council of
Working class Housewives. Many members of these branches come out Passaic
to help in the actual work of the kitchens, and all go back as enthusiastic
supporters of the work. The long continuance of the strike makes it necessary
to extend the work by opening several more kitchens. This will mean the
collection of more and more money and food stuffs. The United Council of
Working class Housewives is calling a conference in Passaic on the 19<sup>th</sup>
of June to which all women&#8217;s organizations are urged to send delegates.
Here the basis will be laid for bigger and better support of the textile
strike through the children&#8217;s

numbers that hours passed before they had fed all.
<p>The women of Council No. 2 of the Working class Housewives had a committee
of ten women present, who were helped by some of the women of Council No.

<p><b><font size=+1>What Will Bring the Mill Owners to Time</font></b></center></p>

<p>It may be blasphemy to suggest that the mill barons are not the whole
cheese in the state of New Jersey and in the United States, but we still
hold that they are not.
<p>It may be further blasphemy to suggest that the mill owners will some
day have to come to time, but they will.
<p>The agency that will bring them around and make them quite willing to
talk to the workers about settlement will not be any particular courtesy
on the part of the mediators or on the part of the workers themselves or
the union. The bosses do not bow to bows. They do not faint at sob stories.
They do not listen to facts and figures. They do not care about public
sentiment. They are not concerned with the welfare of their workers and
do not worry what happens in the community where they have scooped in their
millions. Their heart is not softened by statistics of mortality or by
women&#8217;s working nights, by children dying while slaving in their mills
and by the poverty and suffering caused by the inhumanly low wages they
pay.
<p>They do not listen to a priest or to a rabbi or to professional investigators
who to come to them with a desire to have the strike settled justly. Diplomatic
overtures have no influence on them.
<p>Then what is left?
<p>There is still one certain crowbar that will pry them loose and turn
them over.
<p>It is POWER.
<p>And that power is in the union of the workers.
<p>The solidarity and the unity of the workers in this strike and the continuation
of this unity and the unbroken ranks of the workers and the cementing of
them into one firm body like that of a trained athlete with muscles and
brains and guts and determination will pry them loose.
<p>Power is what is needed and nothing else. That power is now in the workers
through the union they have established. This union is being perfected
and trained and strengthened. Before it the mill owners will quake some
day. They will come and beg. They will regret that they were not more decent
to the workers in the early weeks of the strike. They will wonder what
the workers will do about the beatings and the jailings and the insults
they have had to endure at the behest of the bosses. They will know that
the workers would be justified in using most severe measures. And they
may be surprised to find that the workers will be entirely fair and entirely
free from revenge and entirely just, and that they will deal with the brutal
tyrants without any thought of retaliation.
<p>Power alone will bring the mill owners to time and they might as well
make up their minds to the fact that this power is here and that the longer
they wait the harder it will be for them to bow to the inevitable.
<p>For the workers in the textile industry have determined to organize
the entire industry and with that they will have the necessary power to
protect themselves against the injustice that has be heaped upon them in
the past.

<p><b><font size=+1>Blacklisting And Labor Spies</font></b></center></p>

<p>&#8220;These Passaic and vicinity mills have for a long time successfully
opposed collective bargaining on the part of their employees. In order
to more certainly prevent their employees from becoming organized, none
of these mills would hire a new employee until he been investigated by
this council and could show a card from the office of the council. The
main idea of the investigation was to determine whether the applicant was
likely to become a &#8220;troublemaker.&#8221; By a system of code marks on the card,
the several were enabled to know the objections attaching to the applicant
and to hire or refuse to hire accordingly.
<p>&#8220;The council kept records of the employees and former employees of the
member mills and any former employee of any of them who had either quit
or been discharged was unable to obtain employment by any of these mills
if his former record showed that he had been guilty of any serious infraction
of the rules or policies of the member mills. That is, potential leaders
in organizations of the workers, were blacklisted as troublemakers. If
there was any suspicion that the applicant for a position might possibly
cause any trouble, or influence other employees, or create dissatisfaction

<p>Conclusive evidence of Labor&#8217;s firm determination to back our struggle
to final victory is shown in the continued flood of letters daily arriving
at Relief headquarters. Labor is answering the bosses threat to starve
the workers into submission in the only effective way it could be answered
--- with money and supplies. But great as is the response the need is always
several laps ahead, and the General Relief Committee of Textile Strikers
is urging the friends and supporters of the striking textile workers to
redouble their efforts at this juncture. Following are some of the larger

<p><b><font size=+1>Where Is Senator Edwards?</font></b></center></p>

<p>Twenty weeks have passed since the Strike began in Passaic and vicinity.
A very serious situation has existed ever since in this entire community.
The whole state and the whole country has felt the effects of the strike.
<p>Does this bother Senator Edwards? Does he take an interest in the affairs
of his state?
<p>He did arise to oppose the resolution for an investigation of the textile
industry. He did make a trip to Paterson and stopped off at Passaic for
a few moments. He did tell the strikers to go back to work and take chances
with the bosses for a settlement afterward.
<p>Oh yes. Senator Edwards was here all right. But for what purpose? No
one is in the dark as to the purpose of Senator Edwards. One thing and
one thing only was in his mind: How best to serve the mill owners.
<p>When he found that the workers were standing firm he sat down in his
soft seat in Washington and for all we know he has forgotten that there
is such a place as Passaic.
<p>We are in the twentieth week of the strike and Senator Edwards never
so much as sends us a word. He might at least ask how we are getting along,
but he does not even worry about that.
<p>The workers gave the votes that elected him. They did that because they
were fooled into doing so by the press and the bosses. They did it ignorantly.
They had figured on getting help from Senator Edwards in case they needed
it. They did not know that the bosses would get all his support. The bosses
had only one vote to a hundred votes of the workers, but Senator Edwards
thinks that this one vote is more important than the hundred that the workers
threw away on him.
<p>Good and well. The workers have learned a very valuable lesson. Not
the strikers only, but the workers in all of New Jersey. The actions of
Senator Edwards stand out as one of the unforgettable insults to a suffering
mass of workers. They will see to it that such insults will not be hurled
at them again by this man.
<p>In spite of Senator Edwards, the investigation of the textile industry
will go on. Reliable investigators like W. Jett Lauck have dug up evidence
against the mill owners and shown up the conditions and the wages in the
mills where the workers refuse to slave away their lives unless they get
relief.
<p>So the investigation will be carried on and the facts will be brought
to light even if Senator Edwards goes to sleep and snores like a saw mill.

<p>*************************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Strikers Study And Learn.</font></b></center></p>

<p>The strike has become a veritable university to the mill workers who
never had a chance to study the problems of their own lives.
<p>First of all the workers have learned to write. They are contributing
some of the best material in the Bulletin as well as writing for other
publications. Some of their articles are reprinted by labor papers and
journals far and wide. In this number of the Bulletin you will find several
contributions from the strikers who never thought of seeing their articles
in print before the strike. You will read&#8212;and your eyes will get wet
as you rend&#8212;the little play on the strike, by a striker&#8217;s girl of 11
years of age. No son or daughter of any of the bosses even after they might
be through a university could begin to match that little girl in intelligence
and insight.
<p>In the second place, the strikers have learned to organize. You ask
them what is the most important demand in this strike, and they will not
mention the abolition of the wage cuts, nor the ten per cent increase.
These are important to them, but they have a broader vision and they now
see clearly that the most important demand is the recognition of the union.
The union is first and last with all the workers now. They will rather
die than go back to the mills without the union.
<p>In the third place, they are learning about their own importance in
the industry. They have become aware of the fact that all the bosses together
could not run [one mill.] The minuet the workers stop working everything
stops. The entire industry is helpless without the [workers.] The whole
community suffers when the workers quit.
<p>Not so when the bosses leave. They never quit working for they never
began. But they do go to Europe, and they do go on long trips, and they
do leave the mills and go far away. Julius Forstmann and his daughters
and wife were on a six month trip to Europe returning toward Spring. Max
Stoehr was in Europe many months at the same time and did not worry about
his mills as far as his work in them was concerned. Bahnsen is in Europe
most of the time peddling his daughters to rotten counts whose titles cost
millions of dollars.
<p>Did anyone ever dream of blaming these gentlemen for the closing down
of the mills? Were the mills at all dependent on their presence in them?
The workers are learning that as far as the bosses are concerned they can
stay in Europe all the time. It does not matter at all.
<p>But as soon as the workers leave the mills every loom hangs like a dishrag.
The whole community is upset and business goes on the bum. The papers begin
to holler and the patriots stand on every corner gawking with their mouths
open cursing the strikers and the leaders and make a mournful noise. Why
don&#8217;t they holler when the bosses go to Europe? Why don&#8217;t they cry when
the mill owners go on a lark? Because there is no change in the industry
and no stoppage of work.
<p>From now on the workers are going to take their proper place in industry
and not grovel in the dirt at the feet of the tyrannical and useless bosses.
The workers have decided to stand erect and be men and women. If they do
the work they will demand a decent pay for it and decent treatment while
performing it.

<p><b><font size=+1>The Unity Conference</font></b></center></p>

<p>A new era is dawning in the textile industry. The conference held in
Imperial Hotel of New York, Saturday and Sunday, promises to have far reaching
effects.
<p>There are a number of struggling unions and committees in the textile
industry that have been fighting valiantly for years to become strong enough
to cope with the situation among textile workers. But it is fully recognized
that the power of the bosses is not to be dealt with on a small scale.
In many cases there have been defeats of the workers and the conditions
have constantly grown worse.
<p>Leaders in these organizations have recognized the necessity for unification
of all the forces and amalgamation of all the organizations. This problem
was taken up at the conference and the first steps were taken towards definite
work along these lines.
<p>The Passaic strike has inspired the other workers to more determined
effort to organize the unorganized in the textile industry. The existing
unions afford a splendid basis for such work. With all these united into
one live working force it would be possible to make a tremendous headway
among the unorganized.
<p>The committee that has been elected to carry on the work will have the
unanimous support of all the workers in this important and vast industry.
Only hope and encouragement is seen with nothing but full success as a
final result.

<p><b><font size=+2>Furriers Union Celebrate Victory in Big Demonstration
and Parade</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Business in New York Stopped Along Streets Of March
For Four Hours</font></b></center></p>

<p>In a monster demonstration that stirred this city as no labor parade
has ever done, the Furriers Union of New York celebrated its strike victory
on Tuesday morning in which its 12,000 members joined to the last individual
and in which 10,000 other union men and women participated, while hundreds
of thousands of sympathetic workers blocked the streets for four hours
to cheer the marchers on their way.
<p>Starting from the meeting halls in lower Manhattan, the line followed
4<sup>th</sup> street to 3<sup>rd</sup> avenue to 8<sup>th</sup> street
and 2<sup>nd</sup> avenue to 11<sup>th</sup> street, left to 4<sup>th</sup>
avenue, up to 21<sup>st</sup> street, then to 7<sup>th</sup> avenue, to
32nd street, turned back to 6<sup>th</sup> avenue, to 22<sup>nd</sup> street,
back to 4<sup>th</sup> avenue to Union Square where a tremendous demonstration
was held in front of the Freiheit, with prolonged cheers and the singing
of the International.
<p>Six bands kept up the music. The most popular air was the International
in which vast masses joined singing. Business ceased and the multitudes
in stores and factories waved their handkerchiefs and red bandanas, shouting
and cheering their victorious brothers in the long fight that ended so
successfully for the union.
<p>Banners with large letters read:
<br />"Three cheers for the 40-hour week.&#8221; <br />"Long live the Furriers Union.&#8221; <br />"Long live our present leadership.&#8221; <br />"Solidarity in the Furriers Union.&#8221; <br />"The General Picket Committee will always be ready to protect the Furriers
Union.&#8221; <p>Large sections kept singing &#8220;Solidarity Forever,&#8221; and after each stanza
they shouted &#8220;Three cheers for Passaic Strikers.&#8221; <p>A large wreath of red roses made up into the huge letter G had the picture
of Ben Gold in the center. This young leader has become a great power among
the workers, and his influence over the masses and his ability to make
the progressive leadership the dominant force in the union has placed him
in very high esteem among the rank and file. With the remarkable popularity
he has achieved he carries himself quietly and modestly among the masses
by whom he is deeply loved and respected.
<p>&#8220;The success of this strike,&#8221; said Gold, &#8220;lies in the fact that the
rank and file was drawn into the struggle and the workers themselves were
called upon to shape the policies and to carry them out. Other unions must
do the same and will meet the same success when that plan is followed.
<p>&#8220;Our next step is Amalgamation which will insure strength to the union,
and thus make it invincible against the bosses.
<p>&#8220;The present leadership is made up of the expelled members, driven out
by the reactionaries. We came back and made a success of our work. This
should be a warning to the reactionaries not to expel the intelligent element
and the progressives.
<p>&#8220;We brought into this struggle all the unorganized and have added over
1,000 new members. Most of these were Greeks and they have already proven
to be among the most active. We keep an open door to the newcomers and
make them welcome.
<p>&#8220;Of course the 40-hour week is the biggest gain. The next big gain is
the demonstration to the workers of their power.&#8221; <center>

<p><b><font size=+1>Damage Suits Are Brought Against Brutal Cossacks</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Police Who Attacked Innocent Workers to Be Prosecuted</font></b></center></p>

<p>Civil suits amounting to $70,000 damages have been brought against six
Passaic policemen in the Circuit court by Benjamin Lovanski, Polish organizer
for the United Front Committee and John Ricci. The suits are being pressed
by the American Civil Liberties Union.
<p>Benjamin Lovanski, an active organizer for the United Front has been
threatened by police many times for his successful work. On May 6 they
seized the opportunity to punish him by beating him up and arresting him.
His was one of the most severe cases of beating during the strike, and
as usual, entirely unwarranted.
<p>On May 6 a woman scab was hit by a tin can thrown by a mischievous child.
Many workers were about, it being time for the few scabs to leave the mill.
The police chased some workers children who had not thrown the can, and
arrested them, jostling them about and handling them roughly. Lovanski,
who was standing near, spoke to the police officer asking him not to frighten
the child, and then to the child, telling her to go quietly. The Cossacks
seized that excuse. They set upon Lovanski and beat him badly, so that
more than five weeks afterwards he still bears the marks and is under medical
care. The officers named are Herman Zober, Barney Warshaw, Henry Berger,
Peter Nieradka, and Edward J. Hogan.
<p>After the beating and arrest of Lovanski, he was charged with attempting
to incite the crowd to riot, but was acquitted at his trial.
<p>&#8220;Bloody Friday,&#8221; May 14, is still echoed in the case of John Ricci against
Officer John Van Hoven. On this day, when scores of strikers were set upon
and clubbed by police as they were returning from the meeting hall to their
homes, John Ricci was attacked on his own property and was beaten by Van
Hoven. The officer was engaged in the &#8216;noble&#8217; work of clearing the streets
of strikers. He came upon Ricci, standing in his yard and ordered him to
move on.
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t move on. I&#8217;m home already,&#8221; said Ricci. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you whether
you can move on or not&#8221; said Van Hoven, and attacked him.
<p>Ricci is asking for $20,000 and Lovanski is asking $50,000 damages.
<p>It remains to be seen what the courts will do in the civil cases, whether
there is justice in those courts or not. It has been established quite
definitely during the strike that no redress can be had from the criminal
courts when a striker is beaten to the point of unconsciousness by the
Cossack police. In two attempts to bring policemen to justice, warrants
could not even be obtained for sixteen cases and were only served in the
other cases after much quibbling and delay. Officers finally accepted service
and were released without bail.

<p><b><font size=+1>All Labor Jubilant Over Great Victory of Fur Workers
Union</font></b></center></p>

<p>Win 40-Hour Week and Ten Per Cent Increase in Wages
<p>The four month&#8217;s struggle of the 12,000 furriers, which was declared
by the New York Joint Board of the Fur Workers International Workers Union
following the lockout of the workers by the Fur Manufacturers Association
has ended victoriously for the workers. The long and bitter struggle that
started February 17 has come to a close. It was a victory for the 40-hour,
five-day week.
<p>At four o&#8217;clock Friday morning, Ben Gold, chairman of the general strike
committee and Samuel E. Samuels, of the Fur Manufacturers Association,
signed the new agreement which expires Jan. 31, 1929. The strikers win
not only the forty-hour week, but ten per cent increase minimum raise and
a substantial reclassification of minimum scale, no overtime, no sectional
contracting and no discharge during a week preceding a holiday, and the
union to permit work on Saturday during four autumn months of September,
October, November and December, with extra pay.
<p>The strikers waited all night for news of settlement, then paraded through
the fur manufacturing section singing and thronged to meeting halls where
the celebration continued all morning. The agreement was presented to the
shop chairman at a meeting Friday afternoon at Manhattan Lyceum. It will
be brought before the workers for ratification of mass meetings Monday
morning at nine o&#8217;clock, at Webster Hall and the Manhattan Lyceum. The
majority of the workers will be back in their shops by the end of next
week.
<p>The furriers issued an appeal for support of the strike on the basis
that it was a struggle to establish a shorter work-week, a forty-hour week.
Labor unions, central trade and labor councils, joint boards and labor
organizations of all kinds endorsed the forty hour proposal. The forty-hour
week meeting held by the fur strikers in Madison Square Garden was a big
success.
<p>The manufacturers have conceded the forty hours together with other
demands. The great strike marked by splendid mass picketing and magnificent
courage has ended in a great victory not only for the fur workers but for
the whole working class. Great credit is due the splendid generalship,
courage and ability displayed by the leadership of Gold and his associates
and the general strike committee. The greatest credit is due the militant
rank and file of the furriers union and especially, the picket committee.
They faced the gangsters and police who carried guns, clubs and knives.
They were arrested by the hundreds. In spite of the many scars of battle
that they displayed, they continued the struggle with renewed enthusiasm
and courage every day. It is the rank and file that made the victory possible.
<p>We all hail the victory of our fellow fur workers. It marks the beginning
of great forward strides not only in the needle trades but throughout the
American labor movement.

<p>The conference will convene at 2 p. m. on Saturday June 19, at strike

get the strikers back without their union. In all these efforts they have
failed. The union is strong as ever. But the union needs your help to carry

<p>The fur strikers have won! After eighteen weeks of struggle they have
won the great victory of a forty hour week and a ten per cent increase
in wages.
<p>They met in New York on Monday to celebrate their victory. Eleven thousand
of them met in three fine halls to ratify the agreement, to cheer their
leaders, and to express their solidarity with the Passaic textile strikers.
<p>It is a thrilling scene. To the Passaic visitors it is prophetic. Our
victory meeting will be like this when we have won our struggle. Flowers
on the platform and more coming up the aisle! Songs! Cheers! Laughter!
Joy! Happy faces! It is victory. After eighteen, long, anxious weeks, it
is victory!
<p>&#8220;Gold, Gold, Gold!&#8221; cry the people, anxious for their leader to come.
"Weisbord, Weisbord, Weisbord!&#8221; cry the people in Passaic. It is so like
our own meeting.
<p>The power of the great furriers union is seen in the assurance of the
people. Here are no wage slaves, driven to long hours of labor for a miserable
pittance. This is a great powerful group of workers, who do not fear to
hold their heads up before the boss. The boss respects them because they
have power, and all workers respect them because they have built this power
for themselves. They are self respecting. They know that they have fought
courageously. Seven hundred of them have been arrested during the strike.
They have been beaten up by gangsters. They have been framed up. They have
been attacked from all sides. They saw their treasury run low so there
was no money for relief. In the face of everything they fought on. they
were undaunted. Now their faces reflect the joy of an honest victory.
<p>The speakers tell of the struggle, explain the agreement, discuss the
treatment of scabs. The scabs cannot keep on working after they have been
scabbing on their fellow workers jobs. No,&#8212;they will all lose their
jobs as they have already lost their place in the union, and they cannot
have either back again under the agreement until the union says so.
<p>The people listen and applaud. Telegrams are read from unions and friends.
<p>Ben Gold comes to the stage. He is young and strong, a leader like Weisbord.
The people love him as we do Weisbord. When his leadership was questioned
they shouted for him. Just as we shouted for Weisbord at the Wallington
meeting. In victory they cheer him as we will cheer our leader.
<p>He has no sooner quieted the people than new cheering breaks out and
shouts of &#8220;Weisbord&#8221; from the furriers who recognize him at the door. Weisbord
has come to the victory meeting to bring the congratulations of the Passaic
strikers and to remind them of our struggle. How the furriers cheer the
leader of the fight in Passaic.
<p>&#8220;I do not know why you cheer for me when the whole world is cheering
you,&#8221; he began. &#8220;In a time when there was pessimism in the labor movement
your union has stepped forward and won a victory for all labor. At a time
of wage cuts, you have won an increase. When hours were being lengthened,
you have won shorter hours. You have been the first of the workers crashing
through the tyranny of the bosses.
<p>&#8220;But if there is to be a strong fist, there must be a strong arm and
a strong body to support it. The textile industry must be that body for
you. Now consider our condition as compared with yours. You have a minimum
wage of $40 and you have won an increase. We have a minimum wage of $12
a week and superimposed upon that miserable pittance, a ten per cent wage
cut. You have won a forty hour week. We are threatened with a fifty-four
hour week. Long ago you have seen to it in your union that your shops are
decent. We have shops that make life in the mills a veritable hell.
<p>&#8220;In Passaic we have looked to you during our struggle. When we had mass
picket lines, you had mass picket lines. When we were clubbed, you were
being clubbed. Your leadership was attacked as was the leadership of the
Passaic strike, and you ratified yours as the Passaic strikers ratified
theirs. I hope I will offend no one if I say that I would feel myself honored
if I model myself after your leadership and follow in its footsteps. I
will go back to the Passaic strikers, on the twenty-first week of the fight
with renewed courage, with renewed faith, with renewed energy. Your victory
will carry us over the top.&#8221; <center>

<p><b><font size=+1>Lying Reporter Gets Call Down For False Statement In

<p>In an open letter to the New York World, Albert Weisbord has exposed
the statements of John J. Leary Jr., &#8220;labor expert&#8221; for the New York World,
as made in that paper this week concerning the textile Unity Conference
as entirely false. His letter is as follows:
<p>&#8220;In a statement to the press, William E. G. Batty of the American Federation
of Textile Opperatives and chairman of the Publicity Committee of the Unity
Conference called by the Federated Textile Unions last Saturday and Sunday,
branded as false the statement made by John J. Leary Jr., the &#8220;labor expert&#8221; of the New York World. Mr. Leary had stated, although he was not present
at the meeting and did not know anything about it, that in the meeting
Weisbord had proposed a plan for calling sympathetic strikes, which plan
was turned down by the Conference and to which Brother Tanzy of the American
Federated Textile Operatives was bitterly opposed. Mr. Batty points out
that nothing could be further from the truth and that the reporters stating
this were wildly using their imagination. All action taken at the Conference
was unanimous and a hardy spirit of cordiality prevailed.
<p>&#8220;It seems strange that the New York World, a liberal paper, should continue
to have in its employ one who is reputed to be a member of the Department
of Justice and who writes such deliberately false articles. Mr. Leary is
being repudiated by the American Federation of Labor and by every decent
labor organization that knows what his tactics are.&#8221; <center>

<p><b><font size=+1>Ashamed Of Their Brutality</font></b></center></p>

<p>A judge in Wilmington, Del., sentenced two men to a term in prison and
forty lashes for an alleged hold up. The prison time was not out of the
ordinary, but the flogging was. It is a remnant of barbarism and is not
allowed in decent communities.
<p>So when the pure and good officials started to give the forty lashes
they drove out all newspapermen and photographers. The cameras were confiscated
and the plates destroyed even though there were no pictures taken.
<p>One fellow, a New Yorker, climbed up on a wall and took some pictures
of the flogging, he wanted to show the raw flesh and the streaming blood
and the blue welts that the nice warden produced on the backs of bound
human beings who writhed in the anguish of the blows. But he was arrested
and fined $5, his camera taken from him and smashed, and narrowly escaped
a flogging himself.
<p>When the officials want to do some real dirty work, they do not want
any publicity of it.
<p>You all remember the smashing of the cameras in the strike. The Passaic
police under instruction of the mill owners did such rotten work that they
knew it would put this town in the class with blackest barbarism.
<p>The bosses are doing such dirty work in Passaic that they do not like
to see pictures of it. But they may not be able to keep their outrages
from the screen of this country. It is well to let the world know just
how brutal some inhuman vultures are. They shall not rule forever.

<p><b><font size=+1>Successful Tag Day</font></b></center></p>

<p>Lawrence held its third tag day for the benefit of the Passaic strikers
today.
<p>Thousands of workers could be seen wearing the beautiful red roses which
was their symbol of solidarity with the brave Passaic textile strikers
who have who have been fighting so heroically for twenty weeks.
<p>Thousands of Lawrence workers are out of work and are only living from
"hand to mouth.&#8221; Those that are working, work only two, three and four
days a week. Despite this, the workers dug deep into their pockets and
gave pennies, nickels and dimes. Many pitiable ta1es of suffering were
told to the collectors by these workers, who have produced abundantly ---
for the bosses&#8212;all necessities of life and have nothing now to show
for it but shabby clothes, callous hands and ill health.
<p>The collectors who were well informed on the Passaic strike situation
and unemployment, answered hundreds of questions&#8212;questions such as:
"When are they going to win?&#8221; &#8220;Will they stick to their Union?&#8221; &#8216;Will there
be a strike in Lawrence soon?&#8221; &#8220;Will all the textile unions join together?&#8221; "Will Weisbord come to Lawrence after the Passaic strike?&#8221; &#8220;What can the
United Front do for the unemployed?&#8221; The collectors had a very busy day
answering so many and all kinds of questions&#8212;but they feel that the
United Front is now closer than ever to the workers and that very soon
Lawrence, like Passaic will have a 100 per cent organization. The four
highest collectors were: Fred E. Beal, $74.49; William Murdoch, $71.38;
Mary Siskind, $65.23 and L. Sheffts, $30.63. The total amount collected
was $137.79.
<p>The total expenses were:

<p><b><font size=+1>VICTORY FUND CAMPAIGN IS ON!</font></b></center></p>

<p>$200.000 Victory Relief and Defense Fund Sponsored by May, 29 Conference
<p>That labor will back the gallant fight of the textile strikers to the
victorious end, is the cheering message being received daily at the office
of the General Relief Committee of Textile Strikers at 743 Main Avenue,
Passaic, N. J.
<p>The Committee finds this very encouraging at this time, as, with the
strike entering its twenty-first week, the strain is getting daily more
acute. Every day brings additional need for relief. Strikers who formerly
were able to get along on their slender resources are now finding it necessary,
in increasing numbers, to apply for strike relief.
<p>It was with this in mind, that the May 29 &#8220;Support the Passaic Strike&#8221; Conference authorized and sponsored a campaign to raise $200,000 for strike
relief purposes. That campaign is now under way, and is known as the $200,000
Victory Relief and Defense Campaign. Of the $200,000 which it is proposed
to raise, $100,000 will be used for child relief; children&#8217;s kitchens,
playgrounds, summer camps, etc.
<p>Labor is determined to protect the strikers children from the bosses
starvation offensive. Labor is determined that there shall be no cries
of hungry children to break the splendid morale of the Passaic textile
strikers. Organized and its friends are out to defeat this latest and damnable
barbarism of the textile barons, and the following letters, a few of those
being received, show that labor recognizes the need for continued relief.

of the textile strikers right to live and have a strong union of their
own.
<p>Chicago will have a relief conference on June 16 at Ashland Auditorium,
at which Clarence Darrow, the great labor lawyer will be one of the speakers.
Albert Weisbord, Strike Organizer and leader, has been invited and will
attend if he be spared from the Passaic front.
<p>Pittsburgh will have its conference on June 21 to organize relief for
the strike.
<p>In Brownsville, Pa., a relief conference will be held June 27.
<p>Cleveland will have a conference June 29. Two girl strikers have been
sent to Cleveland to help along the work.
<p>Two strikers will also go forward to Philadelphia where relief activity
is being intensified.
<p>In New York City, a delegate conference will be held June 25<sup>th</sup>
at 8 p. m. in Labor Temple, 244 East 14<sup>th</sup> Street for the purpose
of further organizing relief. Invitations to this conference were sent
out two weeks ago and have met with a lively response. Already scores of
duplicate credentials have been returned to the New York office of the

<p>The General Relief Committee of Textile Strikers is making a nation-wide
effort to organize a conference in every city. All friends of the working-class,
all supporters of the Passaic strike, are asked to co-operate to the end.
In cities where there are not enough labor unions, sympathizers should

<p><b><font size=+1>Nancy Puts One Over on Teacher</font></b></center></p>

<p>The economics class at East High School of Cleveland, Ohio, was given
the opportunity of hearing about conditions in Passaic at the present time,
when Nancy Sandowsky, the &#8220;Joan of Arc&#8221; of the Passaic strikers talked
to them in their class room on this subject.
<p>Although it had been the policy of the teacher either to evade the question
of the strike or skillfully to squirm out of answering questions about
it, Nancy managed to get the truth across. She told of the experience of
the strikers delegation to the White House and to the home of one of the
two New Jersey senators in Washington, and how the President refused to
see the strikers and the senator showed plainly that he was not going to
take the side of the textile workers against the bosses of the New Jersey
mills. Then she told of the clubbing of women and children in the strike
area, of the starvation and cold that the strikers have suffered since
the strike began.
<p>Of strike organizer and leader Albert Weisbord, Nancy said, &#8220;Weisbord
is our real leader, and we will stand by him until we win the strike.&#8221; <p>The students who heard this talk, heard the truth probably for the first
time. Even the teacher had very little to say, for he had against him this
time two fighters, one a member of the Young Workers League, who made the
proposition that Nancy speak, and the other one who knows far more about
the real side of economics than the teacher ever imagined existed.

<p>Participating in the great textile strike in New Jersey are many hundreds

part in the strike, being delegates of the union and captains on the picket
lines. They are showing a splendid spirit.
<p>There are nearly 800 colored men, women and children among the strikers,
and they are making it pretty hot for those workers, white and colored,
who have sneaked back to the mills to scab on the union. At Lodi alone,
there are fully 400 colored strikers. At Passaic and Garfield are other
hundreds. They have been addressed several times by leaders of the of the

<p>Hurrah for our strike! You should see the children forming picket lines
around the scabs houses. They begin 5 P. M. and end at 9 P. M. if the police
don&#8217;t break them up. When they do break them up, you should hear them kids
yell &#8220;Cossacks&#8221; at the top of their voices and as soon as the police leave
they form another picket line. They march around until they get tired.
Then they disperse in an orderly manner until the next day. You can be
sure they will keep this up until the strike is over, even if it takes
all year.

<p><b><font size=+1>Roaches Go with Company Unions</font></b></center></p>

<p>I have been working in the Forstmann and Huffmann Plant in the spinning
department, where they make the young workers as well as the old work like
slaves for the weekly wages ranging from 15 to 20 dollars. There were times
especially in the summer months when the heat is so intense, so unbearable,
that the spinner musters up enough courage in spite of the fact that he
could easily be fired according to how the boss feels, to go to him and
tell him that the people can&#8217;t stand it any longer and he&#8217;ll have to let
us go home. Then three out of ten complaints he&#8217;ll agree with the spinners.
<p>The floor we worked on was very oily and it was easy to slip and injure
yourself. In the summer when it was about 95 degrees outside, it was 110
sometimes 120 degrees in the mill. We had to work with water running our
faces and backs. We had no windows open. All day long we had to work in
the same stinking air as there was no ventilation at all.
<p>In my room there were about 400 to 500 people working in the same air
day after day. When anybody got sick they were sent home. If they were
not better in a few days they lost their job. The room is dark, dirty and
very clogged. Everywhere you see roaches running around. If you put your
lunch on top of the machine the cockroaches eat a hole right through your
bread.
<p>There is a small girl about four feet tall slaving in these mills for
a wage of five to six dollars per week. The bosses give you five minuets
to the lavatory. But when they (bosses) go they stay about an hour and
a half. If our machine breaks when they are away we have to wait till they
come and fix it, without being paid for the lost time. A few years passed
and I was making an even $8.90 a week. Then the 10 per cent reduction,
following this the strike. I went out for an increase in wages, better
conditions, a union and no discrimination against union workers.

<p>**********************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>Noted Economist on Passaic Conditions</font></b></center></p>

<p>We said something in last weeks Bulletin about &#8220;High Tariff and Low
Wages.&#8221; We printed a statement from the Peoples Reconstruction League,
the Farmers Organization at Washington, showing how the textile workers
get less of the value of their product they make under the present high
tariff than under the lower tariff. And yet the mill owners cry for the
high tariff and tell the public that it means higher wages. This, it has
been clearly proven, is a lie. The mill owners, of course, get more PROFITS
under the high tariff <b>but the workers fare worse!</b>
<p>These facts and others concerning the conditions under which the Passaic
workers toil&#8212;and strike ---were laid before the United States Senate
Committee on Education and Labor by W. Jett Lauck, eminent author and economist
formerly associated with the U. S. Commission on Industrial Relations and
later with the National War Labor Board under William Howard Taft and Frank
P. Walsh.
<p>Mr. Lauck spoke before the Senate Committee at a hearing on Senator
Shepherds resolution calling for an investigation of the conditions in
the textile, steel and aluminum industries. The hearing was held in Washington
on May 26, 1926. Lauck&#8217;s findings are so significant we quote the chief
sections of them as follows:
<p>If the protective tariff system is designed among other alleged advantages
to make possible decent standards of work, living, and compensation to
American wage-earners, the highly protected industry of Passaic and vicinity
is the most colossal sham and hypocrisy ever perpetrated on the American
wage-earner.
<p>The Woolen and Worsted industry, which is highly localized in that city
now enjoys an average protective duty of 78 per cent. This should afford
an abundant margin of profit to the mill-owners after establishing standards
of work and wages which are contemplated by the tariff law and which have
been sanctioned by enlightened public opinion and successful industrial
leadership. Instead of conditions which arise from wise industrial statesmanship,
however, and which were to be stimulated by the existing tariff legislation,
those which actually exist are quite the reverse. They not only repudiate
all accepted industrial safeguards and guarantees for wage-earners but
they also disregard the most elementary, moral and human standards. The
mill owners of Passaic have flagrantly violated the fundamental intent
of the existing tariff law, and have been recreant to every obligation
of political and industrial democracy. <b>They should</b> <b>have the unreserved
condemnation of the Congress, and of all those who love humanity and who
cherish democratic institutions and ideals.</b>
<p>Of the conditions which exist in Passaic, it is difficult to speak temperately
and briefly. The wrongs, oppressions, and exploitations which the people
have [endured] may, however, be summarily recapitulated as follows:
<p>FIRST:&#8212;The Passaic mills, against which the strike has been directed
are alien controlled. The majority were under the Alien Property Custodian
during the War. They are now under the domination of large German textile
interests. The Alien Property Custodian reported that the Botany Mills
were 85 per cent enemy owned, the Garfield mills 47 per cent, the Gera
mills 88 per cent, Passaic Worsted Spinning Company 60 per cent, Forstmann
&amp; Huffmann Company 72 per cent. They have been established behind our
protective tariff wall in order to evade competitive disadvantages. Since
the War and the return of these properties to German control, the effort
has been constantly made to impose an intolerable Prussian industrial autocracy
upon the employees.
<p>SECOND:&#8212;The workers of these mills have been denied the right to
organize. Industrial spies have been used to detect and thwart any attempts
in this direction, wage earners who have joined labor organizations have
been blacklisted, discriminated against, and summarily discharged.
<p>THIRD&#8212;The employees of these mills are denied the right of collective
bargaining through representatives of their owns choosing. The mill owners
will not recognize or deal with their organizations. This is a fundamental
right which is essential to industrial freedom, and which custom, precedent,
and enlightened opinion and statesmanship have established in our basic
industries. Its denial in industrial life is analogous to the denial in
political life of representation as a condition to taxation. The mill owners
of Passaic, however, repudiate this fundamental safeguard of industrial
liberty.
<p>FOURTH&#8212;The workers of these mills are denied a living wage, or a
wage sufficient to enable them to support their families decently or in
health and with any degree of comfort. By way of illustration, seventy-one
per cent of the workers in the Botany Worsted Mills earned during 1925
less than $1200 while the remaining 29 per cent earned less than $1600.
The absolute inadequacy of these earnings is shown by the fact that the
National Industrial Conference Board, a federation of the leading employers
organizations of the country, which is not sympathetic with the attitude
of organized labor, as the result of original investigations in the adjacent
textile communities of West Hoboken and Union Hill, New Jersey, established
the sum of $1604 per annum as the necessary &#8220;minimum cost of living among
wage-earners&#8221; families. As a matter of fact, the annual earnings of the
worker in the Passaic mills are not sufficient to maintain the minimum
standards of subsistence, or, a bare annual existence for himself and his
family.
<p>FIFTH&#8212;Under these deplorable conditions, in order that families
may exist at all, wives and children, must go to work in the mills in order
to supplement the earnings of the husband and father. The 1920 Census shows
that in New Jersey textile industries there were employed 27,588 men, 24,609
women, and 8,168 children under 16 years of age.
<p>Our own original investigations have shown that the usual custom in
Passaic is for the husband to work in the day, while the wife works at
night. Although this night work of women is forbidden by State Law, the
law is not enforced because of a legal tangle deliberately produced by
the mill owners. Although the people of New Jersey have forbidden it, the
Passaic industrial autocracy has by manipulation thwarted their will, and
women are forced to work at night.
<p>Because of the economic pressure on the mother, she can secure no relief
even during the period of pregnancy, because it is then that family expenses
increase. There are many instances of babies being born at the mills. Frequently,
the time taken from work by mothers, amounts to no more than a few days
before and after the birth of the child.
<p>SIXTH:&#8212;The effect of these conditions upon infant mortality is appalling.
Those who control the Passaic mills and direct their policies are indirectly
but morally guilty of the premature and avoidable deaths of thousands of
infants. Passaic has 43 per cent greater mortality than has the entire
state of New Jersey among children under one year of age, 52 per cent greater
for children under 5 years, 32 per cent greater among children 5 to 9 years
of age. The blood of these children is on the hands of the Passaic mill
owners for they have created the conditions which resulted in their deaths.
And they have done this thing under a tariff of 78 per cent which was designed
to protect the wage earner and his family.
<p>SEVENTH:&#8212;That working conditions in the Passaic mills are intolerable.
<p>During rush periods, the wage earners, both men and women, are forced
to work long overtime hours, under penalty of discharge for refusal or
even unwillingness. During slack seasons, they are placed upon part-time
and are sent home at unexpected and irregular hours.
<p>The foremen are exceedingly brutal. Language used to employees is profane
and indecent. Facilities for men and women are unsanitary. Ventilation
is bad. The results are preventable occupational diseases such as rheumatics
and tuberculosis. Much of the work is classed as dangerous, and most of
the danger could be eliminated by a humane management. The mill owners
as a whole are completely indifferent to the welfare of the workers.
<p>The workers are thus deprived of their fundamental industrial liberties
and subjected to intolerable working conditions. They have been deprived
of all rights and privileges which have been sanctioned by State and Federal
legislation, by judicial decisions, by public and private arbitration boards,
by the best public opinion and industrial statesmanship, and by the pronouncements
of all Christian churches without regard to denomination.
<p>On the other hand, the mill owners have been reaping excessive profits
from the benefits of protection and the exploitation of their employees.
For the 7 years ending December 31, 1923, the profits of the Botany Worsted
Mills, by way of illustration, averaged $3,160,212 per year, or $93 per
share on each share of capital stock outstanding. In 1924, a holding company
was organized with a tremendously increased number of shares of no par
value in order to conceal earnings. This new company owns the Botany and
Garfield Worsted Mills, and has large interests in two German textile manufacturing
groups. A part of the funds realized from the reorganization was used to
finance these textile interests in Germany. Blair &amp; Co., the underwriters
of the new holding company in their statement relative to the sale of the
new securities created stated that the Botany Mill &#8220;had never had an unprofitable
year.&#8221; <p>All the other companies with the exception of the Botany, are closed
corporations, and make no public report to the usual financial manuals
and agencies. The Alien Property Custodian in taking over the properties
in 1918 reported earnings ranging from 10 to 25 per cent, and these returns
have been larger instead of smaller, since their return to their original
alien owners.

<p>SPRINGFIELD, Mass., June Relief work is moving fast in Springfield,
Mass. A United Relief Committee has been organized, comprising ten organizations
so far, as follows: Women&#8217;s Educational Club, Italian Progressive Club,
Jewish Cultural Club, Workmen&#8217;s Circle, Branch 711; Workmen&#8217;s Circle, Branch
745; Workmen&#8217;s Circle, Branch 716 (Holyoke); Independent Workmen&#8217;s Circle,
Jewish Branch Socialist Party, and the Workers (Communist) Party.
<p>On Tuesday, May 25, Ella Reeve Bloor spoke before our committee, and
filled [us] with enthusiasm to carry on the work. We have a prominent store
to serve as a station for the collection of clothing donations, and last
week we shipped five cases to Passaic. On Sunday night we are holding a
mass meeting with J. O. Bentall as speaker and the following Sunday we
are organizing a house to house canvass.

<p>The Baltimore Conference which we call the Baltimore Committee for the
Relief of Passaic Strikers met last evening with the Ladies Culture Society,
to hear the report of last weeks Conference at Passaic from our delegate,
Mercer G. Johnston. There was general enthusiasm over the fine work that
the Strike Committee is doing, the excellency of its practical working
of relief and the splendid spirit of men, women and children.
<p>The practical outcome of the meeting was that a collection was taken
up by the Ladies Culture Society, which amounted to $50 which was &#8220;matched&#8221; by a similar amount by the Chairman of the Baltimore Conference. This is
a good augury for success on our new slogan of <em>another thousand for
Passaic.</em>

<p>To Organized Labor And All Sympathizers: ---
<p>THE FUR WORKERS WON THEIR STRIKE! This should inspire the entire organized
labor movement. Other UNIONS have had their victories. Other workers have
won strikes because they were ORGANIZED INTO A UNION.
<p>&#8220;WE ALSO WANT A UNION!&#8221; We the TEXTILE STRIKERS of New Jersey want to
win enough wages to keep from starving and we know we can do this through
a UNION, in this effort of ours to ORGANIZE THE UNORGANIZED, all of ORGANIZED
LABOR should be interested.
<p>Gary does not want the Steel Workers to ORGANIZE. The automobile barons
do not want the Auto Workers to ORGANIZE. Rockefeller does not want the
Oil Workers to ORGANIZE. The textile barons do not want the Textile Workers
to ORGANIZE. ALL THE BOSSES ARE AGAINST UNIONS. ALL OF LABOR must fight
FOR UNIONS. This is very plain.
<p>WE MUST BUILD THE ORGANIZED LABOR MOVEMENT OF AMERICA! And the best
way to begin is by HELPING US, THE TEXTILE WORKERS, WIN OUR STRIKE. You
can help us win by SENDING A DELEGATE to the conference called by the General
Relief Committee of Textile Strikers. Friday evening, June 25, at 8 p.
m., Labor Temple, 244 East 14<sup>th</sup> Street.
<p>THE FUR WORKERS WON! NOW ON TO PASSAIC. Victory is just around the corner!
Your help will SCORE! The Fur Workers HAVE WON! NOW ON TO PASSAIC. Let
everyone, EVERY UNION, every sympathizer, GIVE A LIFT TO THE PASSAIC TEXTILE
STRIKERS. AND THIS RIGHT AWAY! Lets score AGAIN in Passaic!

<p><b><font size=+1>Who Are the Bomb Throwers?</font></b></center></p>

<p>The papers and the police report that there have been bombing of houses
and porches in Clifton and Garfield.
<p>In each instance these bombs have been of mysterious origin and the
police say they stand &#8216;&#8217;baffled.&#8221; <p>The reports are that these bombs are put at the homes of scabs. The
implication is made that the strikers are the bombers.
<p>But there is a greater mystery about the inability of the police to
capture these bombers. No trace of them is to be found. In one case the
bomb was placed at the house of a worker who was not a scab. That seems
to &#8220;baffle&#8221; the newspapers greatly.
<p>It is very clear that the strikers could not possibly profit by the
use of bombs. That method has never been used by decent strikers. It would
be the surest way of losing the strike. No intelligent leadership will
for one moment tolerate anything like that.
<p>So it may be put down as an absolute certainty that the strikers and
the strike leadership in Passaic are not the guilty ones.
<p>Where must we look for the bombers. The place to look is where the fellows
live who want to break the strike. Who are the most anxious to see this
strike lost?
<p>No one need to guess very long. The bosses are very anxious to see this
strike broken. They have used every weapon they could think of to break
this strike. They have flirted with death itself. If they could place a
bomb so that someone would be killed and then fasten and frame this on
the strikers, they think they would be able to divert public sympathy,
arrest the leaders of the strike, stop meetings, raid the offices and by
sheer force and terrorism break the strike.
<p>The skirts of the Woolen trusts are crimson with crimes of this kind.
The trick was tried in Lawrence and the crime of bombing with loss of life
was traced to no lesser figure than the president of the woolen trust,
Mr. Wood, who committed suicide last winter in Florida.
<p>There is no mystery about the inability of the police to find the bombers.
The bosses control the police thoroughly, and it would not be natural for
the police to snoop around the nests of the bosses for bombers. The police
made that mistake once and found the president of the woolen company, Mr.
Wood, as the fine gentleman who used bombs and then blamed it on the strikers.
<p>Now the bosses teach the police that they must not make such blunders
any more. Hence the police stand &#8220;baffled.&#8221; <p>There is no depth of infamy to which the bosses will not stoop. It becomes
more and more clear that the workers must take hold and root out this evil
weed in the community and establish safety and decency for themselves and
their children.

<p>*************************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>Scabs Spoil Machinery and Goods</font></b></center></p>

<p>The bosses are letting out a yell a minute these days.
<p>They [are playing] a losing game to try to weave cloth with scabs.
<p>[Their] investigators report that most of the stuff turned out by the
scabs is unmarketable. Very few of the scabs know how to do the work, and
some of them are artists at running bad threads and mussing up the goods.
<p>And not only do the scabs spoil the goods, but they ruin much of the
machinery. It will cost the mill owners hundreds of thousands of dollars
to get the machinery back to where the regular workers left it.
<p>Yet the mill owners tolerate the scabs and spend big money to fight
the picket line that influences these scabs against breaking the strike.
<p>If the bosses had given all the money lost in this strike to the workers
it would have amounted to many times what the strikers demand in way of
increase.
<p>The bosses are not the longheaded business brains they are cracked up
to be. They have demonstrated very clearly exactly what not to do.
<p>But their hatred for the union and for anything that gives the workers
any rights that the bosses must respect drives them into the frenzied condition
they now find themselves in.
<p>But we are determined that we will have our union before we go back
to weave good cloth and use the machinery properly.
<p>Let the bosses understand this thoroughly.

<p>*************************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Victory of the Fur Workers</font></b></center></p>

<p>The good news of the victory of the New York Fur Workers who had been
on strike for seventeen weeks came just as we were going to press last
week.
<p>The fight had been waged valiantly by the workers and there had never
been a moment when they felt weak. They had made just demands and like
the textile strikers they were backed by the sympathy and support of the
whole working-class.
<p>Two outstanding factors made the strike successful:
<p>First: The Union.
<p>The furriers are well organized with a splendid union machinery. Every
member of the union had to take part in the activities of the strike. Committees
were at work constantly. The picket line was on the job always. Meetings
were held regularly. Scabs were taken care of effectively and definitely
educated. The power of the union made it impossible for the bosses to carry
on their business without a big loss. The Union kept the workers together
in a fine spirit. It kept up a splendid morale.
<p>Secondly: The Leadership.
<p>Two marked elements characterized the leadership. The first of them
is <b>class consciousness and militancy.</b> No matter what the bosses
put up as excuses for refusing to grant the demands, the leadership had
a reply. The condition of the industry had been analyzed. The methods of
attack by the bosses had been discovered. The plan of action was mapped
out. Flexibility for emergency was there. The leadership adapted itself
to every new situation. Intensive strike education was carried on. Unity
of all forces at hand was maintained. Every available element of strength
was made use of in a skillful manner. Ever strategy possible was brought
into play.
<p>The second characteristic of the leadership was <b>devotion to the workers
and their union.</b> The committees were made up of men and women of integrity
and sincerity. There was no double crossing. No secret meetings with the
bosses. No attempt on the part of prominent persons to mislead the masses.
No star chamber proceedings. No bribery. No faltering or show of weakness.
Every member of the union that was put in trust of leadership made good.
The leadership was made up of men and women of integrity. What an example
to trades unionism in this country and in the whole world!
<p>And there was that leader of power, intelligence and integrity, Ben
Gold. From the fire of one of the hottest battles waged in labor wars he
comes out bright and strong. He met every emergency and solved every problem
like man and a true worker. The bosses hated him and misrepresented him,
but the workers of his union and the workers in all this country love and
respect him for his fine leadership and his unflinching devotion to the
great cause.
<p>Our strike in the textile center is much like the strike of the fur
workers, except they had an organization and a treasury to fall back on,
while we came out empty handed and without a union.
<p>But now we have a union. The workers all over the country help us. We
have also a splendid leadership. This strike has been and is characterized
by fine intelligence and an unshakable integrity. Our organizer, Albert
Weisbord, has mastered the situation at all times. He has analyzed and
pointed out every essential fact since the strike started. He has stood
by the union and the workers to the last ounce of his strength.
<p>Like the fur workers we shall come out victorious.

<p><b><font size=+1>Children&#8217;s Kitchens Are Praised</font></b></center></p>

<p>One of the nurses from School No. 10, Passaic, came on a visit of Inspection
one day to our Children&#8217;s Kitchens. She had heard all sorts of reports
about them; she had heard that they were good and she had heard that they
were terrible. She seemed somewhat disposed to believe the latter.
<p>We showed her all their was to see. We showed her the nice, clean floors
and the windows with their white curtains. We showed her the shining white
pots and dishes; the neatly set tables. We showed her the good, wholesome
food stewing with appetizing odors on the stove; the milk that was ready
for all the children. The children trooped in and she saw them eagerly
eat their meal, served by motherly cleanly-dressed women.
<p>She came, she saw&#8212;she was surprised and full of admiration! She
went away declaring that the conduct of the kitchens was beyond reproach.
All others who have come to pick flaws with our work have gone away with
the same impression.
<p>It happened, too, that in one of the city schools, where the children
are weighed regularly, a general gain in weight has been reported for the
children who are being fed in the kitchens. One little boy has gained as
much as ten pounds! The work of the United Council of Working Class Housewives
is bearing fruit in more than one way.

<p>As a counter move against the strength and determination of the workers
now on strike for 22 weeks, the mill owners in desperation are lavishly
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in bringing into the heretofore
peaceful strike area many hundreds of gangsters and bums secured from all
parts of the country.
<p>Agents are busy scouring every textile center in New England for workers
who are ignorant of the strike in Passaic, while in the meantime regularly
established agencies in the larger cities of the country are steadily cleaning
out the gun men and gangsters and pouring them into the mills in Passaic.
<p>Daily the situation grows more threatening and menacing, for the mill
owners have armed these gangsters and the police permit them to parade
through the streets, in so-called &#8220;citizens patrols&#8221; and attack and beat
up strikers with impunity. Strikers have been stabbed and one striker actually
has been shot. The mill owners, while shrieking that the United Front Committee
is employing violent tactics, are increasing their violence day by day.
<p>We wish to point out that we shall demand that these gangsters and gunmen
who are permitted to continue their brutal excesses are brought to terms
and their arms taken away from them. The high wages that are paid these
imported thugs, we shall demand and in the ……. shall be paid to the peace
loving and orderly workers that have [settled] in Passaic. Too long have
the mill owners controlled the political and administrative machinery of
the strike locality. We are determined to see that the strike area is cleansed
from these thugs and gangsters that the bosses have imported.

<p><b><font size=+1>Gangsters Beat Anthony Toth Blue And Black&#8212;Almost
Dead</font></b></center></p>

<p>Anthony Toth of 74 Dayton Avenue showed his marks to the strikers. At
a mass meeting in Belmont Park, he showed the great black bruises that
a policeman&#8217;s club has inflicted on his body.
<p>After he had been dragged from a striker&#8217;s gathering and arrested for
no offense at all, he was taken into Botany Mill where he was given his
"medicine&#8221; for his crimes. Anthony Toth is a good striker. That is the
whole story of the police objection to him. That is why he was dragged
into Botany mill, the Passaic police station annex, to be given a brutal
beating, so that the marks remained on his body for days.
<p>The Passaic police evidently are getting desperate. For 22 weeks they
have been unable to obey their bosses orders which are &#8220;Break this strike".
They are resorting to more violent means every day. They are determined
to break the spirit of the strike and they think that brutalities like
these will accomplish it.
<p>Anthony Toth showed his marks at the mass meeting. That meant that he
will be back on the picket lines, back talking to the scabs, back fighting
for the Union. The strikers cheered him when they saw his bruises. That
meant that they will follow the example of this good union man. They will
continue to be good fighters. They will win the strike.

<p><b><font size=+1>Councilmen Skeptical about Bombs in Strike Zone</font></b></center></p>

<p>PASSAIC, N. J. (FP).&#8212;In the 21<sup>st</sup> week of the great textile
strike here the strikers ranks remain unbroken despite all the police brutality
that has been used against them. Mayor William Burke of Garfield has been
trying to get Sheriff George Nimmo to go with his deputies to that town
and supplant the local police. But Nimmo has refused, saying: &#8220;Unless Mayor
Burke can show me that the strikers are rioting and that life, limb and
property are in danger, I will not order out my guards. I want to know
also who would pay for this special service, for these guards cost a lot
of money.&#8221; <p>Burke went to Nimmo after the Garfield city council had reported his
request that it call the sheriff and his men again. Burke presented a petition
signed by 800 citizens asking for such action. The exploding of two bombs
at night was part of the argument for obtaining additional &#8220;protection,&#8221; as it was plain that various councilmen were skeptical about the origin
of the bombs. Many people here remember that William A. Wood, head of the
American Woolen Company, was convicted of causing dynamite to be planted
by agent provocateurs during the 1912 strike in Lawrence, Mass.
<p>In breaking up a crowd of 200 strikers who were listening to a speech
by strike leaders, the Garfield police dragged Mrs. Anna Murat into a patrol
wagon. She had a baby in her arms and two children clinging to her skirt.
[Anthony] Toth, striker, was ejected from Hungarian hall by policemen here
and was taken to Botany mill, where he was beaten so savagely that he is
not expected to live.

<p>**************************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>How Long Will the Workers Stand For Such Judges?</font></b></center></p>

<p>In their sheer desperation the mill owners are resorting ever more openly
to violence and provocative tactics. In yesterday&#8217;s papers, Recorder Baker
of Garfield is reported to have said, &#8220;You strikers have declared open
war on the public and law abiding residents of this city, and it has become
necessary for us to fight back. It is my sworn duty to see that law and
order are maintained in this city and I intend to do so. You people have
been trying to make fools of the police officers and we will stand it no
longer.&#8221; <p>Under this charge that the strikers are committing acts of violence,
the gangsters imported by the mill owners and the police are daily clubbing,
knifing, and shooting our strikers. Yesterday for example, one of our strikers
was seized by the police, rushed into the Botany mill office and beaten
senseless by clubs. At yesterday&#8217;s meeting we took a picture of the man&#8217;s
body which was all blue from the clubbing that he had received. In Garfield,
the hired gangsters and imported scabs acting evidently under orders of
the mill owners and with the official sanction of Recorder Baker, are parading
through the streets armed to the teeth with guns, knives, clubs, blackjacks
and lead pipes. Everywhere they are beating up our strikers while the police
look on and laugh.
<p>What does all this mean? It means that the mill owners have declared
open and violent war against the strikers. The mill owners understand they
are above and beyond the law and can with impunity perpetrate all of the
outrages that they continuously place against the strikers.
<p>What can the strikers do? Can we file complaints with such bitter and
biased judges as Davidson and Baker? Davidson has repeatedly declared that
he will listen to no strikers complaints against policemen of Passaic.
Recorder Baker, in such statements as the above, made publicly over and
over, has proven himself a Fascist who would stop at nothing in crushing
the union and toadying to the mill owners.
<p>We wish to say that should these provocative actions on the part of
the mill owners result in clashes that it will not be the fault of the
union or of the strikers. When strikers are dragged out of their homes
at night time and beaten up by police and scabs together, should someone
be injured in the process, the citizens in the strike area will understand
that it is the mill owners and their agents who are directly responsible
by their provocative and violent actions for anything that might result.
<center>
<p>**********************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>Mayor Botany Burke Finds Nimmo Scared of Strike Zone</font></b></center></p>

<p>Sheriff Nimmo will not come back to Garfield. Although Mayor Botany
Burke spent a whole day in the sheriff&#8217;s office, crying that the interests
of the bosses might be damaged if he did not return to institute another
reign of terror in Garfield, Sheriff Nimmo still pussyfoots.
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d better not come. You really don&#8217;t need me,&#8221; says the sheriff.
<p>This is a very different tone from the former occasion upon which Sheriff
Nimmo came to Garfield. He scarcely waited for an invitation at all when
he came in to read the riot act to peaceful pickets in front of Forstmann-Huffmann
mill. In fact, nobody knows just who did invite the sheriff to step in
with his hired gunmen to deprive peaceful citizens of the right to congregate,
to hold meetings, discuss the strike, or do anything which displeased this
little Czar. Everybody passes the buck. Sheriff Nimmo says that Mayor Botany
Burke invited him but Mayor Burke says no, he didn&#8217;t.
<p>So little Sheriff Nimmo, came, and the union broke his lawless rule
and he left Garfield the joke of the whole country. Perhaps he remembers
that lesson the Union gave him. Perhaps he hesitates to return to face
a strong, militant organization like the United Front Committee which has
shown the world that it will move to protect itself when its rights are
infringed upon.
<p>Or perhaps, the bosses who paid the bills of the sawed-off-shot-gun
gentry have decided that the reign of terror was a bad investment after
all. It did not discourage the strikers into scabbing. It didn&#8217;t present
mass meetings and discussions of the strike. It didn&#8217;t present picketing.
It didn&#8217;t serve to break the strike. The weeks of terrorism, unjust arrests,
brutal assaults upon strikers, came to exactly nothing. The bosses need
their money just now. It may be that they haven&#8217;t any to waste on a sheriff
and his gangsters, who have already been proven useless to them.

<p><b><font size=+1>Strikers Force Police to Retreat</font></b></center></p>

<p>For the third time within a week, the striking textile workers have
forced the police Cossacks of this region to leave their union meetings.
Two Sundays ago a troop of twenty Passaic Cossacks were ordered out of
Ukrainian Hall by Albert Weisbord, strike organizer and leader. Weisbord
informed them it was a union meeting on private property, and open to union
members only. They were asked to show their union cards, and failing to
do so were ordered out. Their retreat was accompanied by a chorus of boos
from the 9,000 union members present.
<p>During the past week the experience was repeated at Belmont Park, when
Garfield Cossacks were forced to leave the premises. Last night the police
again invaded the union meeting at Belmont Park, and again were ordered
out. They called up headquarters about the matter, but were informed that
they had better leave the hall. And they left.

<p><b><font size=+1>Cloak Makers Strike Appears Inevitable</font></b></center></p>

<p>Only a change in the attitude of the cloak and suit manufacturers here
toward the unions demands can avert a strike of 45,000 members of the International
Ladies Garment Workers Union in New York. The union&#8217;s joint board has issued
a call for a mass meeting in Madison Square Garden on June 29 at 4 p. m.
At that time final word of the workers to their employers in advance of
the expected strike will be said.
<p>Manufacturers and sub-contractors in the employers industrial council
have accepted the recommendations of the governors special mediation commission
with regard to wage and working conditions, but the I. L. G. W. U. has
rejected these recommendations, contending that they ignored the principal
grievances of the workers. The jobbers have not yet announced their position.
<p>For two years this controversy has been brewing. The union demands include
a 40 hour work week and a guarantee of 36 weeks work a year. If the employers
persist in their present attitude, it is likely that the 45,000 workers
concerned will walk out early in July. It is evident that the patience
of the cloak and suit makers is close to an end.

<br />1. Restoration of the wage previous to the cut and 1 per cent per yard
increase.
<br />2. Recognition of the union.
<br />3. Time and a half for overtime.
<p>Efforts of the company to resume work in the weaving department with
strikebreakers have failed. The strikers are getting strong financial and
moral support from other labor unions and from other organizations here.
Sympathy of local merchants is largely with them.
<p>Various workers who had quit the Bloom firm obtained jobs at the B.
and A. Corticelli Company&#8217;s mills. One day recently the weavers union learned
that Ed Bloom had visited the Corticelli offices and conferred with the
heads there. Immediately afterward all the former Bloom employees were
"laid off&#8221; by the Corticellis.
<p>Affidavits made by numerous strikers at the union&#8217;s request attested
that they had made an average wage of $23 a week before the cut and an
average of $17.18 afterward. Young weavers of short experience, running
only three looms, could make only $15 maximum wages. And the younger weavers
were always at the mercy of the straw bosses, who frequently were insulting,
the union charges.

<p><b><font size=+1>Textile Workers of Lawrence</font></b></center></p>

<p>The Textile Barons of New England and the millionaire mill owners of
Lawrence have declared war upon the textile workers. At the conference
of the Cotton kings, held in New York, they decided to starve the workers
into submission.
<p>The mill owners of Lawrence have a program of more wage cuts in the
fall of the year. Not content with indirect wage cuts through speeding
up and part time work, they openly speak in their full page ads in the
newspaper of the necessity for direct wage cuts.
<p>The political henchmen of the mill owners are brazenly preparing themselves
for the return of the 54 hour week. You textile workers of Lawrence may
think that this is impossible. But it is a fact. The Industrial Commission
appointed by Carr did nothing else but discuss the necessity for the return
of the 54 hour week.
<p>Unemployment is very severe. You workers are going through a hard summer.
Your savings are all eaten up. The masters intend to solve the unemployment
crisis by creating fake commissions while they speed up still more. You
now produce too much working part time, and the mill owners want to increase
your hours so that you will work less days, and do 3 days in two for smaller
pay.
<p>The bosses want to reduce your already miserable starvation wages until
you reach the stage of Chinese Coolies. The bosses can do all this because
they are organized. They have their economic and political organizations.
You can only save yourselves and your families from inevitable starvation
by organizing yourselves and STICKING TO YOUR UNIOIN.
<p>The wolf is already at your door. Hunger is facing your women and children.
In the Fall of the year the masters are coming with another wage cut. Will
you take it? We know you won&#8217;t. We know that you will resist! BUT HOW?
You must be prepared like your brave brothers in Passaic. Your only salvation
is the UNITED FRONT COMMITTEE. YOUR ONLY GUARANTEE IS YOUR UNION CARD AND
THE UNION DUES STAMPS, which you see on this page.
<p>Only workers holding this card are members or the United Front Committee.
Only workers who buy this dues stamp are affiliated with the United Front
Committee of Passaic which is leading the wonderful struggle of your 16,000
brother textile workers. All other dues stamps are peddled by the company
union people of 184 who are agents of the bosses.

<p><b><font size=+1>Who Gets Vacation?</font></b></center></p>

<p>Fellow Workers:
<p>Our mill owners who are on their vacation on the other side of the ocean,
enjoying all the wealth which we produce here, who do not even know the
looks of the mills spend many an hour of their day on luncheons and dinners.
<p>We workers in the Print Works who toil from 7:15 sharp to 5 p. m. do
not get any time to eat our lunch. If we get hungry lunch hour, we must
chew our dry sandwiches and tend our machines at the same time. The food
which we eat in this way does us very little good. The day&#8217;s work is a
greater strain upon us because we have no rest from 7 to 5 p. m.
<p>The reward for working continuously without proper time to rest or eat
decently which they have forced upon us is [18] dollars 75 cents on the
average. I wonder how long this amount would last our mill owners out in
Europe. I also wonder how a family can be raised on that magnificent wage
even when we are sacrificing our lunch time and producing wealth without
stopping.

<p>***********************************************</center></p>

<p>We, the workers of the Print Works agree with the circular spread by
the United Front Committee on the Shop Council in the Pacific Mills. When
the distributors handed out the circulars one morning at the mill gate,
we took them inside the mill. All the workers in my department read it.
Some fellow pasted a couple of them on the wall in our room, and everybody
stood around reading and discussing it. All the workers liked the circular
and agreed with it. They said it was true and O. K. The shop council is
a suckers and bosses organization. We have no use for it. Even some of
our representatives on the council agreed with the circular. They said
they don&#8217;t believe in the council, but they go there because it gives them
an hour off during work time, to rest. One worker answered him: Isn&#8217;t it
acting the sucker when one man gets an hour&#8217;s rest, and usually has a steady
job, because he is a member of the council, while the rest of us are driven,
speeded up and work part time? If you want an hour&#8217;s rest let&#8217;s get it
for all the workers through a real union. When only a few men get privileges
which the rest of the workers don&#8217;t get, these few are naturally closer
to the boss, and become suckers.
<p>The United Front Committee is right. We don&#8217;t believe in the council.
Let&#8217;s do away with it altogether, and join the United Front Committee which
stands for all the workers.

<p>Dear Fellow Workers:
<p>The letter you distributed at the Print Works this morning against the
company union we have here created a lot of discussion in the Bleach room
where I work. We all know that what you say about the company union is
true. Most of the workers who have voted for the company union delegates
did so because they were afraid to lose their jobs. Many didn&#8217;t vote. The
company union does nothing for us. They never discuss about giving us more
wages or less hours. But the bosses through the company union double and
speed us up and cut our wages.
<p>Many mornings we come to work all prepared for work with our dinners
in our baskets and they make us hang around until 8 o&#8217;clock and then send
us home. If we complain the boss tells us there are many more waiting to
take our place. If we ever needed a union we need it now.

<p>I am a weaver in the No. 10 mill. I make about 17 dollars a week working
so hard that I often don&#8217;t feel my arms at the end of the day. In this
mill the loom fixers act like suckers. They look down upon the weavers,
who depend upon them and take advantage when the loom is [stopped]. Sometimes
they fix the loom so that it wouldn&#8217;t work right. Sometimes they refuse
to fix it altogether and make us lose a lot of time.
<p>A woman worker one day [was fired] because the fixer wouldn&#8217;t fix her
loom. She had children to feed at home. Work was slack. She was making
very little money. The loom fixer purposely took his time and wouldn&#8217;t
fix the loom.
<p>These people should feel ashamed of themselves. They are also workers,
but they are like the bosses. Very often they carry everything they hear
and talk to the boss and he knows about it the next day. No honest worker
should have anything to do with the sucker and bosses tool. They should

<p><b><font size=+1>Youth Conference</font></b></center></p>

<p>About 70 delegates, all young workers, came together to a youth conference
held in New York City on Friday, June 18<sup>th,</sup> to discuss the problems
confronting the young workers in the shops and mills. About 40 of these
delegates came from shops where some 10,000 young workers are employed.
The rest of the delegates came from unions&#8212;shoe workers, needle trades
workers, iron workers, food workers, textile workers. The delegates of
the United Front Committee were all there. Three Plumbers Helpers Clubs
were represented and also the Young Workers League, an organization of
young workers.
<p>All the young workers gathered discussed the problems confronting the
young workers in the shops&#8212;the problems of low starvation wages, long
hours, unbearable unsanitary conditions, bad foremen, speed up, spies and
blacklist agencies, bosses company unions, etc. The young worker is forced
to bear a double yoke of exploitation, for he is oppressed first as a worker
and then as a young worker.
<p>Two of the delegates, both 15 years old, pointed out the lot and misery
of the child laborers. Just as the adult must help the young workers, so
must the young workers help the child laborers.
<p>And it was clear to everyone that if the young workers are to remedy
this situation, they must organize into a labor union. And in this connection
the important role the youth play in the union was pointed out. The youth
are always in the forefront of the fight, bringing with them the spirit
of youth and vigor and enthusiasm and militancy. What better examples can
be cited than the part the young workers are playing in the heroic struggle
of the textile workers and the part they played in the Furriers strike,
which contributed so much to the victory of the furriers.
<p>The conference adopted a resolution pointing out the necessity for the
unionization of the young workers, calling on the American Federation of
Labor to start an organization campaign to bring the young workers into
the ranks of organized labor and urging the local unions to form special
committees to work out ways and means to organize the youth.
<p>Greetings were sent to the striking Passaic textile workers who are
now fighting their bosses for the 22<sup>nd</sup> week. Similar greetings
were sent to the striking shoe workers and to the striking miners of England.
<p>A resolution was adopted against the employment of children under 16
years of age. A resolution similar to the one adopted by the Pennsylvania
Federation of Labor was adopted condemning the Citizens Military Training
Camps as an agency used to train strikebreakers. The conference further
adopted a resolution on the question of race prejudice, and Jim Crowism,
pointing out that the workers must fight the attempt of the bosses to divide
the workers by inciting race prejudice and race hatred.
<p>A committee of 21 delegates were elected for the purpose of carrying
on the work that this conference had begun. This committee was instructed
to carry on a campaign for the unionization of the young workers. Fellow
workers, Joe Harrison, Theresa Staudinger, Nancy Sandusky, Jack Rubenstein
and W. W. Elam were elected on this committee to represent the United Front
Committee.
<p>This conference was a beginning&#8212;an important, significant beginning.
<p>For the first time in the history of the labor movement in America,
the young workers have gotten together to discus the problems confronting
young workers.
<p>The conference was unanimous in expressing the need for the unionization
of the young workers. The entire labor movement must take note of this
expression and must make special efforts to organize the youth if it is
to become a powerful weapon of the working class against the bosses.
<p>What more fitting way of closing the youth conference than with the
singing of &#8220;SOLIDARITY FOREVER"&#8212;and the &#8220;UNION MAKES US STRONG!&#8221; Fine,
clear, voices sang it with a will.

in spite of what the bosses sed, starvation wages won&#8217;t buy bred. They

out of the mills.
<p>During this strike we can learn something. For instance we can learn
how to organize while still young so we will know how when we are older

<p>We must encourage our parents. Some of them say &#8220;Why did I ever go on

who read the Conference Call to the assembled delegates.
<p>Mary Heaton Vorse, of Council No. 8. N. Y. C., United Council of Workingclass

Kuppersmith of the General of Relief Committee, secretary.
<p>The conference was addressed by Alfred Wagenkneht, Relief Chairman;
Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and Mrs. Kate Gitlow of the United Council of Workingclass
Housewives, on the Subject of supporting relief for the strikers and their
families. They were all three vigorously applauded by the delegates and
many strikers present, while from the rear of the hall the children added
their quota with a variation of the union cheer to &#8220;Two – Four – Six –
Eight! who do we appreciate? Wagenknecht! Wagenknecht! Wagenknecht! Two

"Two – Four – Six –Eight! Whom do we appreciate? Gitlow! Gitlow! Gitlow!&#8221; <p>The hall again rocked to thunderous applause as the delegates of those
organizations who were already aiding in the work made their reports, and
in most instances turned in money collected during the last week.
<p>Among those taking part in discussion and reporting were, Helen Yeskevitch,
of the Lithuanian Working Women&#8217;s Alliance of America; Mrs. Raskin of Council
No. 1, Passaic; Mrs. Schwartz of Council No. 6, Williamsburg; Mrs. Bloom,

Alliance; Sarah Sherman of Trenton N. J.; Leona Smith, Mary Heaton Vorse
and Mrs. Kate Gitow.
<p>Resolutions on the Strike, on Defense, on Support of the Kitchens and
Protection of Women in industry were read and unanimously adopted. The
resolutions on the Kitchens, declared, in part:
<p>&#8220;We, as delegates of women&#8217;s organizations, feel most keenly the plight
of the women and children of Passaic. We are ready to fight for them and
with them to win a better life for the women and a future for the children.
Our support of the strike will therefore take the form of relieving the
hunger of the children, that no mother may weaken in the fight through
seeing her child hungry and unfed. We pledge our organizations therefore
to spare no effort, to leave no means untried, to build up a stronger support
for the work of feeding the children in the kitchens established by the
United Council Workingclass Housewives.&#8221; <p>The Conference also went on record &#8220;to support any move for the protection
of women in industry, particularly the textile. It declares itself in favor
of such legislation as will protect women against night work, against working
when pregnant, against long hours, low wages and unsanitary conditions.&#8221; <p>Leona Smith was unanimously elected secretary of the permanent conference
which is to hold regular meetings for the furtherance of plans in support
of the kitchens. One delegate was elected to the permanent conference from
every organization represented at Saturday&#8217;s &#8220;Feed the Children&#8221; Conference.
<p>The first conference will be held on Monday, June 28, at 8 p. m., 177

Saturday at the Feed the Children Conference. And they all overcame their
timidity and gave the conference very interesting reports on the activities
of their clubs and councils on behalf of the kitchen.
<p>&#8220;We wanted to raise money quickly in my club, so we decided to have
a house to house collection. Four of us went out one Sunday morning and
we collected a hundred dollars.
<p>&#8220;Our council held a package party for the kitchens. We made two hundred

<p>&#8220;Our club&#8217; sent in three hundred dollars earlier in the strike. Since
then we made a hundred dollars on meal tickets which we brought here today.&#8221; <p>Mrs. Raskin tried to tell us that she couldn&#8217;t talk. But no one could
believe her since she followed up this statement with one of the best reports
of the afternoon. She showed the conference how the actual work of the
kitchens is carried out. &#8220;We can&#8217;t raise so much money here in Passaic,
since most of our members in the councils here are strikers,&#8221; she told
us. &#8220;But there is one thing we can do and that we are doing to the best
of our power. That is the actual work of feeding the children. What you
might call the heavy labor.&#8221; She went on to explain how the women do the
buying, going all over the town to get donations and low prices. How they

And the satisfaction they feel in seeing the children looking better and
better as the weeks go by.
<p>Frances Ribardo, one of the delegates of the United Front Committee,
militant and unafraid after the training of the picket line, gave a picture
of the work of the striking women; how they get up at five in the morning,
hastily do a bit of work at home, then out to the picket line. In snow
and heat, through all these months, they have been on this job of guarding
the mills. If Mrs. Ribardo is a type of the women in this strike, and if
all are working as she is, the strike can never be lost.

<p>The first offensive of the Paterson police began on Tuesday when seven
United Front workers were arrested there for distributing a pamphlet which
calls upon the Dye workers of Paterson to stop scabbing on their striking
brothers in Lodi. Juachino Salerno, Raffaele Coviella, Salvatore Ribardo,
and Riagia Gugliucci were fined five dollars a piece for the high crime
of pointing out to the Dye workers their miserable condition. Thomas DeFatzio,
Francesco Coco, and Jack Grabinski were dismissed.
<p>The leaflet which they distributed reads as follows:
<p>To All Dye Workers of Paterson:
<center>
<p>Fellow Workers</center></p>

<p>For a long time the Silk dye workers have suffered terrible conditions.
We work very long hours. We get very low pay. How can we live on 40 or
50 cents an hour? The toilets and other sanitary conditions, the poisons
and wetness in <em>the mills are enough to kill even animals.</em>
<p>Why is this so? Why is it that of all the workers in Paterson, we are
the worst paid and the worst treated? <em>It is because</em> <em>we have no
union!</em> We must organize. We must get ourselves into a union to fight
against these awful conditions.
<p>Over in Lodi, the workers of the United Piece Dye have joined the United
Front Committee of Textile Workers. They have been on strike for ….. weeks
and they are putting up a very brave struggle. We must not scab on them.
We must not do the work that the Lodi Dye workers used to do. We must help
the Lodi Dye Workers. Their fight is our fight. They are fighting against
the same conditions that we have here. They are fighting for:
<p>1. 25 per cent increase all wages;
<br />2. 44 hour week;
<br />3. Time and a half for overtime;
<br />4. Decent sanitary working conditions;
<br />5. No discrimination against union men;
<br />6. Recognition of the union.
<p>Dye workers, prepare for our own struggle. Don&#8217;t do scab work. Fight
for decent conditions. Join the United Front Committee. Come to the union

<p><b><font size=+1>Women&#8217;s Meeting of June 17<sup>th</sup></font></b></center></p>

<p>There was a new departure in the last women&#8217;s mass meeting, that of
Thursday, June 17<sup>th</sup>. It was not that it was a big and enthusiastic
meeting, filling Ukrainian hall, seats and gallery, for all the women&#8217;s
meetings have been big and enthusiastic and crowds standing in the rear.
It was not that we heard eloquent and cheering speeches from Organizer
Weisbord, for the speeches we hear are all eloquent and cheering.
<p>Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and from Mother Gitlow. The special feature of
this meeting was a series of talks by some of our own number, some of the
women strikers.
<p>Theresa Staudinger gave a talk that we really must call a speech, it
was so well delivered and so interesting. She explained how the women of
the working class bear a double burden since they must not only work in
the mills, but must keep up the home, bear and raise children as well.
<p>Frances Janicke spoke, and so did Fanny Onischak, the crackerjack organizer
of Council 3, who is doing such good work in the Council as well as on
the picket line, that she brought in thirty-two new members in one week.
<p>The palm of the evening however, was carried off by our friend Anna
Yurka. If you have not heard Anna make a speech yet, engage her for the
next union meeting. She is some speaker, take it from the applause she
got last Thursday. She is no young girl, her hair is white, her face is
[etched] with the struggles of a mill workers life. But she had the energy
and the spirit of a girl when she got up on the platform. And she talked
with the liveliness and the courage of the working woman who is always
young enough to fight the battles of her class. That was a good story she
told, about yanking the scabs out of the Botany. We are going to have Anna
Yurka on the program again, the next time the women hold a mass meeting.

<p>Dear Fellow Workers:
<p>My sister and I were sent out by the General Relief Committee to go
to Washington. We had never made such a long before and at first we did
not want to try, but the trip came off very well anyway.
<p>We set out Thursday morning last week and came back Tuesday night. We
visited different labor unions in Washington, the Paperhangers union, the
Carpenters, the Bookbinders, the Electrical Workers, the Finger-Print Association,
and others. These workers seemed to be, most of them, favorable to us,
and gave donations from their treasury. Delegates from five unions are
going to organize a relief conference in Washington as they have in many
other cities for the support of our strike. This is really the biggest
accomplishment of our trip. We are pretty tired from the ride as we just
got back but the trip was worth it.

<p><b><font size=+1>Garfield Police Lock up Mother, Infant and Two Children</font></b></center></p>

<p>The end of the twenty-first week of the big textile strike was featured
by an attack by Garfield Cossacks on a crowd of 200 women and children
who had gathered in Wood Street, Garfield. This is in the center of the
strike district and not far from the Forstmann &amp; Huffmann mill. Evidently
Mayor Burke, who is an employee of the Botany mills, is not going to permit
the workers to congregate within 100 miles of the [sacred] precincts of
the F. &amp; H., if he can help it.
<p>Because the crowd of children and women did not obey with alacrity the
police order to disperse, some heroic Cossacks charged into the crowd,
swinging their clubs onto the heads of women and the soft, unresisting
bodies of little children. They wound up their orgy by locking up Mrs.
Anna Marut, who had her baby in her arms and two little girls clinging
frantically to her skirt. The police Cossacks locked up all four but were
later forced to release them upon a physicians order.
<center>
<p>Doctor Orders Release</center></p>

<p>After being placed in a cell, Mrs. Murat complained of feeling ill and
City Physician Ernest Casini was called to examine her. Dr. Casini found
the woman&#8217;s heart action irregular and her pulse low as a result of the
atrocious treatment to which she was subjected by the Garfield Cossacks.
He advised that she be taken to her home. She was thereupon released, her
baby and her two little children going home with her.
<p>The incident illustrates both the splendid of the strikers women and
children, many of them strikers themselves, and the barbarous treatment
to which they are often subjected by the Cossack tools of the bosses. The
indomitable spirit with which these striking textile workers meet the onslaughts
of the police and other tools of the bosses should inspire every decent
worker to come to their aid. In this, the twenty-second week of the heroic
struggle, the need is particularly urgent. The strike is still 100 per
cent strike. And the striking textile workers are prepared to battle to
victory, but they must have your support. This is your fight. Help wage
it.

<p><b><font size=+1>Company Unionism at Work</font></b>
<p>(Continued from Bulletin Vol. 1, No. 15)</center></p>

<p>We have already read what Worker A. and Worker B. have to say about
the g-r-a-n-d and g-l-o-r-i-o-u-s bunk company union they have at the Forstmann
and Huffmann Company.
<p>They told us how Mr. Reinhold, the personnel manager, holds this bosses
union right in the hollow of his hand, how the &#8220;representative assembly&#8221; has been a device for speeding up work, spying on the workers and preventing
them from organizing into a real labor union.
<p>Here are a couple more brief statements, made under oath, by workers
who have been fooled and exploited by the company union system.
<p>Worker C:
<p>&#8220;I have been a member of this &#8220;Representative Assembly for the past
four years. I attended regularly the meetings of the assembly. The majority
of this assembly was composed of foremen and the higher employees of the
Forstmann and Huffmann Company. In the presence of these high men, the
members elected from ranks of the workers were afraid to speak up whenever
any complaints were brought to their attention, because if they complained
they were threatened with the loss of their positions…&#8230;
<p>Mr. Reinhold dominated at these meetings, and the workers were afraid
to incur his displeasure.
<p>&#8220;In my four years as a member of the Representative Assembly, I recollect
only a few occasions when a workingman said anything at the meetings. On
one occasion …. the members of the shop committee of the weaving department
had a meeting with the shop committee appointed by the management together
with Mr. Reinhold, and several of the workers and I protested against the
overtime we had to work. Several days after this meeting, the superintendent
of the weaving department called me and another member of our committee
into the office, gave us a calling down and told us that we ought to be
ashamed of ourselves to be on a shop committee and act as we did.&#8221; <p>Then, worker C. tells of the dinner with beer, cigars and refreshments
that was always given the assembly members once a year to put them in a
humor to listen to Mr. Reinhold&#8217;s fine phrases. Mr. Reinhold&#8217;s speeches
always took up most of the time at the quarterly meetings of the bunk union.
However Worker C says,
<p>&#8220;In my four years of experience as a member of the assembly <em>I do
not recollect one benefit to the working people that came from any of the
talking done at these meetings.&#8221;</em>
<p>Words, words, and still more words&#8212;but no concrete benefit for the
workers. That is the story of the company union wherever it has been used
to confuse, mislead and exploit the American textile slaves.&#8221; <p>Worker D:
<p>This worker shows how the company union favorites are natural born strike
breakers with no social consciousness or loyalty to the working class.
He says:
<p>&#8220;I do not know of even one member of the Representative Assembly, elected
for the year 1926, who went out on strike.&#8221; <p>Which is the usual practice with company union suckers. They always
stand by the company and against their fellow workers.
<p>Worker E:
<p>Worker E, shows how the wages went down under the company union regime
and how responsive this Mr. Reinhold was to the wishes of the weavers:
<p>&#8220;About a week prior to the time the weavers left the plant,&#8212;a shop
committee went to see Mr. Reinhold and requested him to give them two looms
to work on. For about seven months before this they had been cut down to
one loom.
<p>&#8220;Reinhold informed the committee that in a week the situation would
be remedied. A week passed and nothing was done to change the situation.
The weavers then went on strike. When they were preparing to leave Mr.
Reinhold approached me and said that if the weavers left they would never
be permitted to return.
<p>&#8220;I then said to him: &#8216;We have been working on one loom for about 6 months
and I have a family of several children. I am required to work 48 hours
a week. I am paid for only 24 hours a week. I make about $17 to $18 a week.
How do you expect me to live?&#8217;&#8221; <p>But all Mr. Reinhold could answer Worker E. was &#8220;Those who leave today
will never come back. They will lose their jobs.&#8221; <p>Like all the other intelligent, self-respecting workers who struck against
the refined slavery of this Prussian company, union worker E. says, &#8220;I
deny the representative assembly&#8217;s right to speak for me believing that
it is controlled by the company. I am on strike and only the United Front
Committee has authority to represent me.&#8221; <p>Scores of workers who have suffered under this hypocritical yoke of
the company&#8217;s stool pigeon union have made statements to the same effect.
This strike has opened their eyes to the relative value of this type of
"union&#8221; as compared to the <em>real trade union </em>controlled and administered
by the workers and their true representatives.
<p>The company union is now recognized as a vicious method of exploitation,
and during this strike it has served as an instrument of strike breaking
and scabbery.

<p><b><font size=+1>Passaic Strikers Battle Industrial Czarism</font></b></center></p>

<p>Coal isn&#8217;t America&#8217;s only sick industry. Textiles also seem in the throes
of despondency. This highly protected industry has caused a series of labor
calamities hardly equaled by coal, extending many years back of 1912, when
the nation was aroused by the inhuman oppression of the Lawrence mill hands.
Misery still plods wearily along the drab narrow streets of the New England
mill towns, rises to a sharp and dramatic climax in Passaic, New Jersey,
where 10,000 workers have been on strike since last winter and then trails
off into unrelieved misery again in the south, where employers exploit
poor Whites and Negroes with equal impartiality.
<p>The terrible problem of textiles runs continuously along the &#8220;fall line&#8221; from Maine to Georgia. Wherever rivers course swiftly from uplands to the
coastal plains will be found squat masses of dull brick red mills wherein
low wages, long hours and seasonal operation spell economic slavery and
un-American working conditions. What is the remedy which will pull these
mills up to the independent standing of representative American industries,
enabling them to pay decent wages to their hundred thousand toilers?
<p>Common humanity could go far in easing the situation at Passaic. If
the employers were willing to look upon their workers as human beings rather
than mere profit producing cattle, the present strike with its acute distress
would never have run its five month course. Instead the bosses have maintained
a studied attitude of no compromise, no bargaining. They refuse to negotiate
with the union of the workers.
<p>Can such industrial autocracy, coupled with unashamed command of the
police and sheriff&#8217;s offices, be tolerated? Are we to solve industrial
problems by policeman&#8217;s clubs, employers Czarism and workers starvation?
Every force in America which looks toward industrial progress and social
well-being and that means every labor union, every church and public-minded
group, should bring pressure to bear immediately on Governor Moore, their
United States Senators, and their related organizations in Passaic to bring
about a just settlement. In the meantime the strikers and their children
suffer keenly in their fight for industrial justice. Contributions addressed
to the General Strike Committee, 743 Main Street, Passaic N. J., will help
relieve that distress.

<p><b><font size=+1>Low Wages and Lack of Collective Bargaining in the
Textile Industry</font></b></center></p>

<p>&#8220;The owners and managers of the textile industry in the United States
have fought a long and successful fight against the unionization of their
employees&#8212;for their &#8220;to run their own business.&#8221; The American Federation
of Labor has thus far failed to provide collective bargaining for about
3 per cent of the workers in the textile in industry, and these, together
with those organized by other agencies, constitute hardly 10 per cent of
the 1,000,000 textile workers in the United States.
<br />&nbsp;
<br />&nbsp;
<p>&#8220;The result of his lack of bargaining power on the part of the workers
in the textile industry is the lowest wage of any group of factory workers
in the country. This fact is shown not only by the direct figures of earnings,
but is further reflected in the percentage increases since prewar wage
levels. The textile workers have received a higher percentage increase
than other classes of employees for the simple reason that their wage levels
were already low and that, as the cost of living rapidly climbed upward,
it was everywhere found to be necessary to give the lower brackets of wage
earners greater percentage increases in order to enable them to live at
all. Higher paid workers were able, by curtailment of recreational and
similar expenses, to get along on percentage increases which, for the low
paid workers, would not have enabled them to live.&#8221; <p>From statement presented by W. JETT LAUCK, noted Washington Economist
to certain United States Senators interested in the Passaic strike.

<p>Richard Kellner ain&#8217;t gonna scab no more. He says so himself. He also
cannot scab, for he got one of his arms mangled last week while scabbing
in the New Jersey Worsted Spinning Company and the whole mill was spattered
with blood. Now the company doesn&#8217;t want him till he gets another arm grown
where the first one was but isn&#8217;t.
<p>Kellner lives in Garfield, and had it in his head that it would be all
right to help the bosses beat the workers who are on strike. This scab
couldn&#8217;t imagine why the strikers have demanded better and safer conditions
in the mills. He may be able to imagine some of that while his arm stub
is healing.
<p>He also did not know that it is quite dangerous for all the workers
to be around unprotected machinery and especially for inexperienced scabs.
<p>This should be a lesson to all scabs. The thing to do is to stay out
of the mills till the strike is settled.
<p>Instead of helping the bosses, all the workers should join the union
and help win the strike. Let this be a warning to all the scabs. It is
always dangerous to scab&#8212;and it is a mean thing to do.
<p>In another mill a boy of 14 was burned to death while scabbing. The
miserable company coaxed the poor child into the mill and all he got in
return was a pine box for a coffin.
<p>The papers do not mention these accidents. But we get the facts just

<p><b><font size=+1>The Thugs Are Here</font></b></center></p>

<p>It seems that the bosses act according to a fixed program in every strike.
There are very few strikes in which the bosses do not use gangsters and
sluggers.
<p>These gents are furnished by regular agencies&#8212;and they cost money.
First of all the agency charges $50 per head to these gangsters. Then the
gangster charges $50 to come. Then there is transportation, and hotel bills.
Then there is the little item of wages. And do not fool yourself into thinking
that these fellows come cheap. They get all the way from $20 to $50 a day
to do the dirty work.
<p>Of course these gangsters are recruited from the lowest depth of degradation.
They are for the most part ex-convicts and potential highway men. Only
the most depraved can be recruited to do the job that the bosses demand
of them. You will see enough of it before you are through.
<p>Naturally these toughs are not expected to do any productive work. In
the first place they are not hired for that purpose and in the second place
they do not know how. They are dead weight and a tremendous expense to
the bosses.
<p>They are supposed to go into groups and start trouble. They start a
fight. They beat the strikers. They try to provoke to violence. If they
can start something and assault someone they have a cop ready. They stay
and point out a striker to the cop and blame him for the slugging the thug
has done. They work hand in glove with the cops.
<p>Then they get after innocent strikers and beat them up as they did with
Toth, whose picture you find in this issue of the Bulletin.
<p>Very seldom the workers get by with only being beaten. In almost every
strike the bosses have a group of thugs kill someone. In every case the
blame is put on the strikers. The leaders or prominent pickets are arrested
and charged with murder. Then the strike headquarters are raided. The leaders
locked up. The halls closed. Meetings forbidden. Gathering in groups prohibited.
<p>Now the bosses have started on this program. Watch them. See how closely
they follow the beaten path of their fellows in strikebreaking and criminal
plotting.
<p>It is the duty of all decent people and especially the workers to demand
that all thugs and strikebreakers and gangsters be driven out of the city.
Tell the bosses in no uncertain way to quit their hellish methods. Make
them understand that all blame for violence will be laid at their door.
Make them responsible for the horrors that they provide for.
<p>The strike has been peaceable from the side of the workers. It will
be so till the end if the bosses do not institute a reign of lawlessness
and terror.

<p>**********************************************</p>
<p><b><font size=+1>They Have Quit Bombing</font></b></center></p>

<p>The tools of the bosses had gotten the bomb mania so badly that it became
a scandal in Garfield and other places.
<p>Of course these gentlemen made every effort to blame the bombing on
the strikers. So the Bulletin gave the workers and the bosses some very
interesting data.
<p>We showed that only those that want to see the strike broken would do
the bombing. For nothing is so harmful to strikers as bombing.
<p>Only those who want the strike broken will use bombs. The strikers do
not want the strike broken. They want to win&#8212;and they are going to
win.
<p>The bosses are the only ones who want to see the strike broken. Thus
if you want to find the bombers you can find them easily.
<p>We showed how bombing in the Lawrence strike some years ago was traced
directly to William A. Wood, president of the woolen trust. This gent had
the decency of committing suicide last winter, so he will not plant any
more bombs.
<p>But his brothers in the trade are not all dead yet. Nor do they seem
to learn very fast. If the police find it difficult to catch the bombers
they might linger about the headquarters of the bosses and get next to
their plots.
<p>Now since we came out flatly showing the source of the bombs the thing
has stopped. The Passaic Daily Herald says:
<p>&#8220;For the first time in several weeks, no bombing or other disturbances
were reported over-night in Garfield.&#8221; <p>So the bosses seem to have taken the hint handed them by the Bulletin
and stopped the outrageous and damnable bombing business&#8212;at least for
awhile.
<p>This is one time when they cannot pull that kind of stuff and get away
with it.

into another attempt to restore &#8220;law &#8216;n order.&#8221; <p>But it seems that the Botany Boy is not as powerful as he would like
to be. In the first place he could not swing the council in Garfield. The
council can see no reason to add to the police disorders by shipping in
a lot of gun men to help them make more hell in a burg that would be entirely
peaceable if it were not for the police, the mayor and the judge who thinks
he is somebody.
<p>The lesson Nimmo learned stuck better than the most optimistic had dared
to hope. The sheriff actually likes to stay away. In this he likes exactly
what all the good people of Garfield like.
<p>He has not forgotten the day he had to hop into a speeding auto in order
to escape a stinging restraining order and get the gaff of the people who
heartily despised the self imposed kinglet.
<p>Botany Burke has not yet learned the lesson&#8212;not yet. But he will
--- even if he has a hide as thick as a buckskin mitten. There seems to
be a little hope for Nimmo. He shows at least a little sign of intelligence.

<p><b><font size=+1>The Mill Owners Are Frantic</font></b></center></p>

<p>The importation of thugs and sluggers indicates that the mill owners
are about at the end of their rope.
<p>These drastic measures are not used until the last hope to defeat the
strikers is gone. That hope is now done. The bosses are frantic. They are
now spending thousands of dollars every day trying to club the workers
back. Their coaxing has failed. Their local police have failed. Their program
of starvation has failed.
<p>Now they are trying the Gangsters.
<p>They too will fail.
<p>The strikers are too well schooled to fall for any claptrap of the bosses.
They have been warned of every trick. They know beforehand every move the
bosses are about to make.
<p>Let all the people of Passaic know what the bosses are.

<p><b><font size=+1>The Beating of Toth</font></b></center></p>

<p>The brutal beating of Fellow Worker Toth looks very bad for the mill
owners. Their gangsters dragged him into the Botany mill and tortured him
till he was near death.
<p>He was brought to the platform at Belmont park when he was barely able
to stand up and his body was shown to the mass of strikers gathered there.
It was a tense moment. Big men wept at the sight of this victim of the
bloodiest of human viciousness. The strikers will not forget this scene.
The children will not forget the black and blue welts and the raw and bleeding
flesh of this faithful striker.
<p>Instead of terrorizing the strikers, this unspeakable deed of the bosses
put iron into the blood of every striker, and made them like steel in their
minds to fight this tyranny to the bitter end.
<p>Such things must stop, and the workers know that only by a firm union
will they be able to do away with such brutality as the bosses are now
using.

<p><b><font size=+1>Clumsy Efforts of Bosses against Leader Act as Boomerang</font></b></center></p>

<p>Albert Weisbord, strike leader, received notice through the capitalist
press on Thursday that the bosses are at work in a new frame-up attempt
against him.
<p>A &#8220;breach of promise suit&#8221; brought by an unknown person designated as
"Rosalind Lapnore&#8221; address not given, has been filed against him in the
Supreme Court of the state of New York.
<p>Not only is the complaint a fake on the face of it, but even the service
of the papers have been framed up, for although Weisbord has not been served
with the papers, court records state that he was served at a Second avenue
address on Wednesday afternoon. An attach&eacute; of the court has reported
back that the papers have been served although Weisbord was in Passaic
all day on Wednesday.
<p>&#8220;The whole story is ridiculous, said Weisbord. The case is a clear frame-up
such as is always tried in every big strike. If they can&#8217;t frame the leaders
for instigating riots or uttering seditious statements they try something
like this.&#8221; <p>&#8220;In the early weeks of the strike I predicted to the workers that the
bosses would try to frame me up on all of these charges. The workers will
not be fooled on this new attack on their leader.&#8221; <p>Jacob Nosovitski, private detective and self-styled &#8220;famous international
spy,&#8221; who brought the mysterious woman described as &#8220;Rosalind Lapmore&#8221; into the office of Attorney Henry Margoshes, No. 302 Broadway, on Wednesday
to institute a $50,000 breach of promise suit against Weisbord was employed
by officials of the Botany Worsted Mills on his statement that he could
end the strike within ten days. This was three weeks ago. He is said to
have been known to them under the name of &#8220;Harry Sanders.&#8221; <p>Weisbord has announced his intention to start proceedings to clear his
name in a suit which he charges is a &#8220;frame-up.&#8221; <p>Max Sherwood, President of the Eagle Detective Agency, No. 1452 Broadway,
said yesterday that Nosovitski came to his agency about three weeks ago,
and submitted to him several proposals to end the textile strike. These
proposals, Sherwood said, &#8220;were not to my liking.&#8221; He said he informed
Nosovitski that he would have nothing to do with the case.
<p>Sherwood admitted that he had employed both Nosovitski and the &#8220;spy&#8217;s&#8221; wife several years ago. At that time they were known as Jacob and Estelle
Nosow.
<p>&#8220;Nosovitski had been hired by Nathan S. Shaw, a private detective specializing
in industrial work,&#8221; said Sherwood. Shaw had been in negotiation with the
Botany Mills. He had proposed to them that he had a man who had promised
to end the strike for a stipulated sum. The amount agreed, according to
Shaw&#8217;s version, was $20,000. I am informed that the Botany Mills advanced
expenses to bring Nosow to Passaic. Nosow in reality Nosovitski, did not
unfold his plan of ending the strike, but did mention that he could obtain
sufficient evidence to warrant Weisbord&#8217;s prosecution by the Federal authorities.
<p>&#8220;It was following this that Nosovitski came to my office. I have a number
of witnesses who were present the day that Nosovitski called on me.&#8221; <center>

<p><b><font size=+1>Rubenstein, Strike Leader, Beaten up in Cell by Police</font></b></center></p>

<p>Jack Rubenstein, picket captain and leader, has been brutally beaten
up again in the Garfield jail. With no slightest excuse for his arrest,
he was seized, taken off to the jail, thrown into a cell, and attacked.
Even Recorder Baker could not find any excuse to hold him when he was arraigned,
and he was dismissed with the payment of costs.
<p>Jack was walking along on Jewell Street early Friday morning when he
was passed by an officer in the patrol wagon.
<p>&#8220;What are you walking that way for? What are you doing here anyway?&#8221; the officer shouted. Jack did not reply.
<p>&#8220;I knew when he spoke to me that I was in for a beating this day,&#8221; said
Jack afterwards.
<p>When he came up to the patrol wagon which had stopped, Officer D. continued
to abuse him and finally told him to get into the wagon.
<p>&#8220;Am I arrested?&#8221; asked Jack.
<p>&#8220;Yes you are,&#8221; said the Officer and Jack was hustled off to a cell in
the station. On the way he received much &#8220;fatherly advice&#8221; a local alias
for threatening, about getting out of Garfield if he knew what was good
for him.
<p>In his cell, Rubenstein was attacked by Officer Number two and &#8220;Whitey
Adamchesky&#8221; who had been a party to nearly all the beatings handed out
in Garfield and who brutally beat Jack with a rubber hose so that he was
sent to a hospital at the time of his last arrest.
<p>&#8220;As soon as I saw them come I lay down on my bench, for I could see
in their eyes what was coming,&#8221; he said after his release on bail. &#8220;I knew
if I even tried to defend myself [there] were fifty more waiting to jump
in on me, and if I was standing up they would only knock me down. I cuddled
up on the bench and protected my face, but they got me plenty.&#8221; <p>A doctor&#8217;s certificate, signed by Dr. D. H. Tellman, shows that he has
"a large area of [thrombosis] (bruises), a swelling and tenderness over
right posterior chest, abrasion and contusion of the right eye.&#8221; He was
charged with being a disorderly person. &#8220;With having my feet too close
to the ground when I walked, I guess,&#8221; says Jack in his characteristic
slow speech, &#8220;Well, I guess it was just my [time] again.&#8221; <center>

<p><b><font size=+1>Police Shoot At Striker&#8212;Hurt By Shameless Scab</font></b></center></p>

<p>Walter Brunko, a striker from United Piece Dye Works, was seriously
wounded in the right arm by an armed scab early Tuesday morning.
<p>When Brunko, Thomas Regan, and Philip Maddalena, all active on the picket
line, spoke to Thomas Branch, a Negro scab in the Lodi mill, asking him
to come out of the mill on strike, he drew a revolver and fired four shots
at the strikers. One of them lodged in Brunko&#8217;s right arm, shattering the
bone of the forearm and tearing the flesh to shreds as it ploughed through
and broke into three pieces.
<p>Then the police joined the game. A &#8220;Special Officer,&#8221; which is another
way of saying &#8220;Hired Mill Thug,&#8221; took it for granted that if there had
been shooting the strikers were to blame. Without a word of warning, he
began shooting after the three men. Maddalena and Regan, who were hurrying
the wounded man to a home for treatment, stopped when the bullets began
to fly, and all were taken to the police station in Lodi.
<p>Too seriously wounded to admit of any delay, Brunko was rushed to a
Hackensack Hospital to receive treatment. Thomas Branch, the gun-toting
scab, was also arrested and charges of assault and battery and threatening
to kill were lodged against him. Regan and Maddalena were released. No
charges were made against any of the strikers, who were held by Judge Wallace
Leyden of Hackensack to be within their rights in addressing the scab.
No explanation as to why the &#8220;Special Officer&#8221; shot without the usual formality
of calling upon the men to halt, was given.

Strikebreakers;</font></b>
<br /><b><font size=+1>Armed Thugs Start Reign Of Terror</font></b></center></p>

<p>Gangsters! Strikebreakers! Gunmen! Thugs! A new reign of terror in Passaic.
<p>Not content with having used every brutality and trick to break their
strike and force the textile workers back into slavery in the mills, the
bosses of Passaic have now resorted to their last device. They are bringing
in strikebreakers and gunmen to terrorize the honest working people of
Passaic.
<p>Hundreds of thousands of dollars are being spent by the bosses in this
attempt to defeat the union. Strikebreakers are promised wages of fifty
dollars a week and free board and room in the mills. Agents are paid to
lie to them and trick them into coming to Passaic to work in the mills
on strike. Newspapers are being paid to advertise all through New England
for &#8220;weavers and spinners,&#8221; for a mill in &#8220;Long Island.&#8221; The textile barons
who are &#8220;too poor to afford&#8221; decent wages for their workers are not too
poor to afford any amount of money in an attempt to keep the protective
union out of Passaic.
<center>
<p>Entertainment For Strikebreakers</center></p>

<p>For the honest workers there have been only starvation wages, the hideous
evil of night work for women, the slavery of little children forced into
the mills to eke out the family income, rotten conditions in the mills
so that the workers felt themselves dying a little at a time as they were
at work, a whole terrible chain of misery forced upon helpless people by
the greed of the mill barons. For the strikebreaker high wages, free board
and room, and entertainment, in a desperate attempt to destroy the only
protection for themselves that the workers have ever been able to establish.
The strikebreakers who are paid these high wages are not even honest workers.
They do not produce cloth. They loaf and smoke in the mill, drawing their
pay for being there in an attempt to frighten the strikers back into the
mills.
<center>
<p>Armed Thugs Parade Streets</center></p>

<p>Daily the situation grows more menacing. The police permit these armed
gangsters to parade the streets in so-called &#8220;citizens patrols&#8221; and attack
and beat up strikers with impunity. The &#8220;mysterious&#8221; bombings which the
bosses would like to attribute to strikers, are made the excuse for these
"patrols&#8221; in which strikers are stabbed and shot.
<p>An amazing story of the trickery of the bosses in obtaining strikebreakers
came to light when some honest workers refused to become scabs and recounted
the methods by which they were fooled into coming to Passaic.
<center>
<p>Tricking Workers Into Scabbing</center></p>

<p>These experienced weavers answered an advertisement of an agency for
workers. In the agency office they were told that they were needed in a
mill in Long Island, and were offered fifty dollars a week.
<p>&#8220;Is there any trouble in this mill?&#8221; the workers asked suspiciously.
<p>&#8220;No, there is no trouble at all. The owners want to replace foreigners
with Americans, that is all,&#8221; the Passaic agent told them.
<p>It was not until the weavers heard the conductor call the station that
they knew that they were being brought to Passaic where there is a strike.
It was almost midnight. No sooner had the men stepped off the train than
they were snatched into taxicabs and before they could protest were driven
to the great gates of Botany Mill.
<p>&#8220;You are to sleep and eat in the mill,&#8221; said the agent.
<center>
<p>Refused To Scab!</center></p>

<p>That was where the weavers got wise. They knew that bosses do not shut
up their workers behind the walls of the mills unless they are afraid of
something. They knew that no honest worker could be living inside those
mills, and that if they once went in they could be kept virtual prisoners.
They knew the offer of the bosses for what it was, a bid for strikebreakers.
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t make scabs out of us,&#8221; they said, and in spite of all the
coaxing of the Botany agents they stuck to that declaration. They went
off by themselves, with no money to get back home, no job and no place
to sleep in a strange town, still staunchly refusing to scab on their fellow
workers.
<p>This was one case where the hired agents of the mills made a terrible
mistake. Instead of the professional strikebreakers and gangsters that
they were looking for, they got three honest workers who could not be fooled
or bribed. In the meantime other agencies in cities all over the country
are busy picking up gun men and gangsters and pouring them into Passaic
to break a strike. There are still plenty of suckers and scabs in the United
States for the mill owners to lay hands on and bring in to terrorize Passaic.
<center>
<p>Bosses Debauching Community</center></p>

<p>&#8220;The extent to which the mill owners are ready to go in debauching the
city in order to crush the strikers is unlimited,&#8221; declared Albert Weisbord
in revealing the situation.
<p>&#8220;With the importation of hundreds of gangsters, gun men, thugs, and
bums from all over the country into Passaic by the desperate mill owners,
three things stand out apparent. First that the mill owners are determined
to take the law into their own hands and create a terrible reign of terror
in the strike area. Gangsters and bums roam the streets at night fully
armed, beating, stabbing and shooting strikers while the police look on
and laugh.
<p>&#8220;Second, the extent to which the mill owners are ready to go in debauching
the city in order to crush the strikers is unlimited. When these mill owners
have women sleeping in the same mill, in the next room to several hundred
men of the character that these bums and gangsters are, one may be sure
that the mill owners, having promised these gangsters &#8220;entertainment&#8221; are
amply living up to their promises, regardless of what the moral cost to
the community will be.
<p>&#8220;Third, the very high wages paid the outside gangsters and thugs shows
how these powerful mill owners are ready to spend their millions to see
that their workers do not get a decent standard of living. Here are these
mill owners, who have amassed hundreds of millions of dollars through the
sweat and labor of their workers, cutting the wages of these already miserably
paid workers, and then spending twenty times the amount of money on gangsters
and thugs that would be necessary to maintain the workers decently. That
such a situation can continue to exist in America is an outstanding disgrace
and a shame. For the workers twelve to twenty dollars a week. For the gangster
fifty dollars a week and &#8220;entertainment.&#8221; Shall that be the slogan on which
to build a democratic America?&#8221; <center>

<p><b><font size=+1>A Picket Line</font></b></center></p>

<p>A few days ago in the evening while I was coming home from Wallington,
my attention was much attracted by the interest the little tots of Passaic
take in this strike of the textile Hell Hole. The girls and boys made a
large picket line on Eighth Street. They were marching up and down in front
of the Gera Mills. A boy with a baby&#8217;s bath tub was beating loudly to the
tune of the other pickets in the rear. Each child, singing gaily, wore
a piece of cardboard over his head for protection against the clubs of
the Cossacks.
<p>Two policemen spied the children and headed toward the spot where the
line was. The children seeing the cops hollered: &#8220;Hip, Hip&#8221; and ran away
on the tracks in the dark night. The cops started to run after them on
the tracks. Although they were chased, the children seemed to enjoy it.
<p>Hold firm, you bold strikers, and you shall get the union which will
be an everlasting victory for all of us working people.

<p>Dear Sir:
<p>The United Front Committee of Lawrence Textile Workers, an organization
which aims to reach out to the other workers and educate them to join hands
and organize in order to better their condition of life, have applied for
a permit to hold open air meetings in accordance with the statutes and
ordinances of the city of Lawrence which state in part:
<p>&#8220;Application to conduct such parade or procession or open air meetings
shall be made in writing to the Director of Public Safety by the person
or persons in charge or control thereof or responsible thereof&#8212;and
in case of open air meetings, shall specify the place at which it is desired
to hold such meeting, the purpose thereof, and the name of the organization
etc., person, in control thereof or responsible therefor the time during
which such meeting is to be held, and the probable duration thereof.&#8221; Further
---
<p>&#8220;If he, (the Public Safety Director) shall find that such.…. open air
meeting is not to be held for any unlawful purpose and will not in any
manner tend to be a breach of the peace, or unnecessarily interfere with
the public use of the streets, and the ways of the city or the peace and
quiet of the inhabitants thereof, he shall issue such permit to the person
or organization making application therefore without fee or charge.&#8221; <p>We affirm that the United Front Committee has complied with the provisions
of the said law, and is entirely and fully entitled to the use of the public
streets under provision of the said law. We are especially cognizant to
the fact that many individuals and organizations such as street venders,
health speakers, demonstrators of wares and salvation army and other religious
organizations have the free use of the public streets without molestation.
<p>We consider the refusal to grant us permits for open air meetings without
giving us any legal grounds or reasons for the action, as a grievous abuse
of public authority, and as a willful and arbitrary and illegal act on
the part of the Director of Public Safety and the City Marshal. We are
prepared to establish our legal rights in the City of Lawrence through
the courts of law and equity if necessary, and we wish to inform you that
the United Front Committee will hold an open air meeting on Monday afternoon,

and make us work on 20 instead of 8 looms. A number of weavers refused
to work on 20 looms. The bosses tried their best to make us accept. They
even promised more pay. But we refused. Several weavers were then forced
to quit.
<p>But the bosses found a member of the Shop Council who accepted the scab
job. Her name is S. Cole. The bosses can always find ready scabs in the
members of the council. They are kept by the boss and given steady jobs
most of them in order to become suckers, ready to do all the dirty work
of scabbing upon the workers.

<p><b><font size=+1>Sample Weavers</font></b></center></p>

<p>Uswoko Mills in Lawrence is very busy at present weaving samples, but
it seems that the new weavers that were put on lately, can exist on smaller
wages than the old timers, although the new help has to be just as efficient
as the old ones. They are requested to weave samples for $21.84 a week
whereas those weaving samples all through the year are getting $24.50.
<p>This is nothing new for the Uswoko. This kind of thing has been going
on for years, and the only reason the workers can find is that when the
company puts extra sample weavers on it is always during slack periods
and that is their only excuse. When are the workers going to have enough
sense to take their chance to better their conditions during the busy seasons.

<p><b><font size=+1>Speeding Up</font></b></center></p>

<p>In the Pacific Mill No. 10 the weavers are being urged to run 20 large
looms, which is double the number that they are using at present. The greedy
bosses are promising a forty-dollar wage to the one agreeing to accept
the 20 looms and also two helpers. How kind the bosses are. They are willing
to pay the helpers $17 each and the weavers $40. The three wages combined
seems to amount to more than the pay of two weavers used now running 10
looms each. Workers, Look Out! Can&#8217;t You See the Trap?
<p>As soon as the twenty looms will be accepted by everybody, the first
thing the helpers will get lost. As for the pay, we know that with every
addition of speed ups the pay envelope gets smaller. The next thing that
follows is more weavers thrown out of work.
<p>The greedy bosses blame the bad times for the great unemployment at
present in this city. It is their speed ups that cause unemployment and
misery to the workers. The workers must not accept the bosses bluff. Let
the bosses use the 20 looms.

<p><b><font size=+1>Bulletin First</font></b></center></p>

<p>Lawrence, Mass.
<br />June 22, 1926.
<p>The Boston American at the order of the mill owners tried to stop us
from reading the Textile Strike Bulletin during our lunch hour today, by
distributing its funny sheet and magazine, section containing pictures
of bathing beauties, degenerate countesses and other society features,
free of charge.
<p>The bosses know that it is dangerous to let us workers learn the truth
about our own struggles. The bosses fear that once we learn the truth about
the power that we have and use it, we will not allow ourselves to be exploited
and speeded up as if we were mere machines, all for starvation wages.
<p>To turn our attention from the Textile Strike Bulletin, the only worker&#8217;s
paper we get in this city, to counteract its influence, the Boston American,
doing the job for the bosses, distributed their stuff at the same time
that the Bulletins were handed out by the Passaic strikers and the United
Front Committee. They did not succeed this time. We all read the Bulletin
with interest while many of their sheets littered the streets.

<p><b><font size=+1>An Explanation</font></b></center></p>

<p>Exception was taken to the article in last issue of the Bulletin that
dealt with some of the loom fixers in Pacific Mill No. 10.
<p>This was not a criticism of the loom fixers as a whole, but of those
in the Pacific mill who act like suckers and rats. No one can defend that
kind of slaves no matter who they are.
<p>All decent loom fixers condemn them. The loom fixers are very strong
union men&#8212;where they are organized, and as a class of workers they
have done much to get other workers organized.
<p>No good loom fixers need to take that article to heart. It was meant
only for those who act for the boss against the honest workers.

<p>The strike is now in its 23<sup>rd</sup> week. It is a time when we

The mills are importing thugs and gangsters by the hundreds. These gangsters

And we can do that only if all the young people get into full union activity.
<p>The union takes care of the young worker especially. We know how the

union to take care of the young workers, young and old. We are going to
build the young workers, develop them in mind and in body.
<p>At this Friday night&#8217;s mass meeting we shall have good speakers, Weisbord,

<p><b><font size=+1>Dinner Pail Epic</font></b>
<br />By Bill Lloyd, Fed. Press</center></p>

<p>I see most textile workers suffer from working for a rich old duffer.
Bum hearts, nephritis and T. B., bad burns, ripped backs and crippled knee.
The laboratory X-ray shows most every kink the doctor knows; an ambling
clinic with a list of few diseases he ain&#8217;t missed.
<p>The reason sure ain&#8217;t hard to find. It comes from workers daily grind
--- poor wage, long hours, and awful pay, bum food, poor homes at end of
day. Too little milk and eggs and meat. The cheapest kinds of stuff to
eat. And too much dust instead of air, and not enough of doctors care.
<p>Health ain&#8217;t essential to industry, as any profiteer can see. So long
as workers have a breath, the surplus fund don&#8217;t fear no death. If he has
strength enough to breed, the plutocrats don&#8217;t have no need of locking
their unhealthy shops because they&#8217;s short a worker crop. Enough tough
babies do get milk to grow sum hands for weaving silk.
<p>So everything is surely jake for grabbing profits with a rake. O, worker&#8217;s
Death, where is thy sting? Big dividends is sure the thing. O, grave, where
is thy victory? Work kills us only by degree.

<p>Let the textile bosses quake and tremble! Within the short space of
four days organized labor in four big cities has sent its delegates in
their hundreds to Passaic Strike Relief Conferences. In each case, permanent
relief conferences have been organized, with delegates of powerful labor
unions and workers fraternal organizations comprising the executive committees.
<p>In New York City alone, 247,000 organized workers were represented at
the enthusiastic relief conference, held at Labor Temple, 244 East 14<sup>th</sup>

pledged the power of their organizations against the starvation offensive
of the rapacious textile barons.

<p>Union, The Main Issue</center></p>

<p>The New York conference for Passaic strike relief was called to order
by Karl Brodsky, temporary secretary of the New York relief organization.
Robert W. Dunn, Civil Liberties Union, was elected permanent chairman with
A, Wise, Joint Board, International Ladies Garment Workers Union, secretary.
<p>Alfred Wagenknecht, relief chairman, outlined relief work in the strike
area, and stressed the need of organizing the strikers for the fight to
build the American Labor Movement.
<p>He asked all unions and sympathetic organizations to again open their
treasuries for the strikers. &#8220;Money in the treasuries must be made to work
for the labor movement in order that it may grow and flourish,&#8221; the delegates
were told. The Relief Chairman asked for shop collections, assessment of
memberships, collection of food contributions, collection on contribution
lists, buying of children&#8217;s campaign seals and milk tickets and the taking
of strikers children into workers homes.

<p>School is over and the children are free. The rich children can be very
happy because they can go to the country and enjoy the &#8220;sweet summer breezes&#8221; and have good food. But how about the workers children, whose fathers and
mothers are robbed by the boss all year round? They must stay in the hot
stifling city. Some go to the country ---sure to work on the farm from
early morning to late at night picking berries and doing other farm work
for a few cents a day. These children have been half starved all year &#8216;round.
They have been poorly clothed and have been living in dingy, miserable
homes. They need a vacation. The bosses children are well taken care of
and robust. They need no rests and vacations, but they are the only ones
getting them. When this strike is won it will be better for the children
of the mill workers. They will have more and better food, better clothes
and decent homes. But while this strike is on, the union is not forgetting
the children. This summer will be the best summer that these children have
ever had. Many of them the union will send to camps. Many are going to
the homes of friends and sympathizers where they will be well taken care
of. For those staying in the city the union will have playgrounds&#8212;out
in the open air where the children will be given a good meal, in addition
to a good time. Hurrah for the union! This is a regular union&#8212;it cares
for the children too.

<p>150 years ago there was a big fight in America. Americans were fighting
against the tyranny of the English bosses and aristocrats. And on July
4<sup>th</sup> the colonists declared that they would fight to a finish
--- until they were free from the yoke of the English bosses. And 150 years
later we here in Passaic are also fighting a big fight. Our fathers do
not make enough to keep us in food. Our mothers work nights and we, the
children, are left uncared for.
<p>Our sisters and brothers go to work while they are yet small, and their
bodies and minds are stunted. 50 per cent more children die in this hell
hole of Passaic than in any other part of New Jersey. We are fighting to
change these things. We are fighting for the chance to live&#8212;for the
chance to grow up into healthy men and women. We are fighting against that
tyranny of the mill bosses who have the right of life and death over us.
And in this fight for the chance to live, the police have clubbed us, and
thrown gas bombs at us, and broken up our children&#8217;s parade and arrested
our leaders. These same police have been protecting those who are after
our lives, for the sake of their own profits&#8212;the mill owners and their
agents&#8212;the scabs and suckers.
<p>Yes, we love our county and we love our country&#8217;s people. We want the
American workers free. We want a Declaration of Independence of the workers
against the mill barons and the other bosses. We want America for the workers.

<p><b><font size=+1>Drive To Feed The Children</font></b></center></p>

<p>If the bosses think that the hot weather will bring a slack in support
of the strike on the relief front they have another guess coming. All labor
is rallying to fresh support with vigor and promptness. The women are doing
their part. This coming week will see a special drive for funds for supporting
the children&#8217;s kitchens, under the initiative of the United Council of
Workingclass Housewives. The drive will be concentrated in New York and
New Jersey. It will begin this Saturday, July 3<sup>rd,</sup> and will
continue until the following Sunday, July 11<sup>th.</sup> A grand drive
over the Fourth in the sea-side resorts, Coney Island and Rockaway, and
in camps such as Nit Gedeiget and Mohegan Colony will inaugurate the week.
It will be followed by a house to house collection of clothing, food, and
money.
<p>The United Council will have the support in the drive of other women&#8217;s
organizations, particularly those which participate in the permanent delegated
conference for support of the kitchens. These include the Workingwomen&#8217;s
Councils, which are affiliated with the United Councils; the Community
welfare League and the Women&#8217;s Educational Club of Passaic. The Mother&#8217;s
club of Henry Street Settlement and several branches of the Lithuanian
Workingwomen&#8217;s Alliance of America.
<p>The splendid work of feeding the strikers children in the kitchens which
were established by the United Council of Workingclass Housewives is to
be extended until every striker&#8217;s child can get one good free meal a day.
Such accomplishment is possible, due to the support of many different organizations.
Among those cooperating in the work are the International Workers Aid,
which pays for the milk, butter and cream daily for the two kitchens, and
the Cooperative Butchers and the Cooperative Bakers of Paterson who provide
most of the meat and the bread. Donations and help in other ways come in
from many varied organizations.
<p>Contributions for the kitchens may be sent either to the United Council
of Workingclass, Housewives 80 East 11<sup>th</sup> Street, New York City,
or to Leona Smith, Secretary of the United Women&#8217;s Conference, 743 Main

<p>She is the greatest bearer of burdens.
<p>She is double slave. She is a slave for the boss in the mill, and a
slave for the family in the home.
<p>She is the one, who, coming home from her toil as a wage earner, plunges
into the round of cleaning washing, ironing, cooking. The day is over….
can she rest?&#8212;No, the mill awaits her. The black gates of the mill
are yawning for her; the machine calls its slave. She must drag her weary
body in to keep pace with her machine through the live-long night.
<p>Now she finds that she is going to have a baby. Unwelcome, another life
is coming for her to take care of. You think perhaps she can have rest?
She can have care, good food, like her rich sisters in this state, someone
to fuss over her? ---No!&#8212;she is a woman of the working class! There
is no money in her house; she must earn the money to care for that new
life. She must drag herself to the mill up to the last week,&#8212;yes, up
to the last day. Her puny baby lying on the bed at home, she must go back
again to the tyrant boss, back to the tyrant machine. There is no end to
her slavery.
<p>But, is she crushed by this life? Is she weak and whining?&#8212;Come
into these striking textile towns, to see the real worth of the proletarian
woman.
<p>On the picket line, in the children&#8217;s kitchens, wherever you go, you
see her. Broadbacked, powerful, there is no job too hard for her. She has
a good laugh for a good joke, and she has an answer for any scab or Cossack.
She is the backbone of this strike.
<p>Compare her with the bosses women that you know&#8212;those fashion plates
with rouge on their cheeks and polish on their nails, driving their own
cars and going shopping and playing with their pet dogs to kill time. You
could blow down a dozen of those pampered dolls with one breath.
<p>But the proletarian woman is the real strength of the race. In her is
a fresh vitality that is hardly yet tapped, and a strength to overcome
all obstacles. She is awakening and organizing. She will show the world
something yet.

<p><b><font size=+1>Milwaukee Labor Sympathetic To Passaic Strike Relief</font></b></center></p>

<p>MILWAUKEE, Wis.&#8212;a special meeting of the Executive Committee of
the Central Trades has been called to take up the question of supporting
Passaic Strike Relief work in this city. Milwaukee labor is showing great
interest and sympathy in the heroic struggle of the textile workers against
inhuman conditions in the mills and starvation wages. Many labor leaders
have declared their intention of supporting relief work there, and the
prospects are very encouraging.

<p><b><font size=+1>Labor Rallying In Its Millions To Strike Relief Needs</font></b></center></p>

<p>Four big relief conferences in four days is labor&#8217;s answer to the textile
bosses efforts to break the strike by hunger and the importation of thugs.
And more conferences are coming. Labor is lining up for the struggle.
<p>This is the kind of news we like to hear. We, the textile strikers can
look only to the workers for the help we need. It is good to see the workers
so heartily and loyally responding to our needs. We, on our part, assure
them of our iron determination to fight on until victory is achieved.
<p>Victory cannot be long postponed now. The bosses are breaking. Their
paid agents are shedding tears all over the pages of the hostile press.
The bosses police and thugs are resorting to violence again. The boss-owned
courts are once more on the job trying to terrorize the strikers. Sure
signs that the bosses are getting nervous over the continued loss of millions
of dollars weekly.
<p>Bread means Victory! You don&#8217;t have to be on the picket line to help
win the strike. You can help by supporting the relief work. Get on the
job with shop collections, assessment of memberships, collection of food
contributions, individual collections on contribution lists, Buying of
children&#8217;s seals ands milk tickets, and the taking of strikers children
into workers homes. You can&#8217;t afford to be a slacker in this fight to organize
the unorganized and build the American labor movement.

<p><b><font size=+1>Wages And The Tariff</font></b></center></p>

<p>&#8220;Every American, even including the Passaic strikers themselves, pays
into the treasuries of the textile mills the a equivalent of the tariff
duties (78 per cent in the case of worsteds). These payments are imposed
upon Americans in order to enable the mills to pay their workers wages
corresponding to the American standard of living. But these Passaic workers
do not get such wages, and that is what they are striking for.
<p>&#8220;The strikers therefore hope, that the United States Senate, which helps
to impose these duties, will either make a thorough investigation of the
situation at Passaic and thus help them to get the wages that are due them,
or to repeal the duties so that they will not have to pay so much for the
clothing (they produce with their own hands) that they wear.&#8221; <p>W. Jett Lauck.

<p><b><font size=+1>District Membership Meetings</font></b></center></p>

<p>In another part of this Bulletin you will find a very important notice
to all strikers. The notice says to all strikers that they are to join
their district membership meetings and then points out that that all of
the strike area is now divided into sections and districts and all members
of the union must be present at the district meetings. Take a look at the
notice now and find out to what district and section you belong. Also find
out when and where your district meets as soon as possible.
<p>Now that the strike is going on for so long, we must bend all our energies
to see to it that a union is formed and the workers carry on union business
right during the strike, just as though the workers were back in the mill
working in their rooms and shops. At the present time we have the United
Front Committee meeting and we have big mass meetings. But we also want
to have small meetings where all the workers can take part and speak. At
big mass meetings not every body can speak. There is no time for all to
speak and besides most of the workers are abashed and timid an afraid to
speak at big meetings. But at small meetings, all can speak and everyone
will then understand that the union is not the union of the organizers
but the union of all the workers.
<p>-
<p>At these district membership meetings the regular business of the union
will be taken up. Picket lines, scabs, shaky and backward strikers, the
relief stores and kitchens, everything that pertains to the winning of
the strike and the building up of a strong union will be discussed and
action taken. At almost every district membership meeting too there will
be a little program, a little educational talk or lecture or some kind
of education done that will make the workers understand the union better
and be better union fighters when they go back into the mill.
<p>The Union is trying to get regular headquarters for the district meetings
and also to arrange to have regular time for meeting. The meeting will
be called to order by the United Front Committee delegate&#8212;not the organizer
who is in charge of that particular district. A secretary will be appointed
and the roll called. An executive committee consisting of the best strikers
of that district will be formed and actually carry out the works decided
upon by the district membership meeting for that particular district.
<p>You see, fellow workers, by the time the strike is over and all of us
go back to work in the mill, we will be real union people, trained union
workers. No longer will the boss bulldoze us, no longer will the foreman
fool us and put us off. All of the workers will know how to handle themselves,
to speak on the floor and to act in a regular union disciplined manner.
To form a union in the midst of a strike is no easy job. But we can do
it. We have done all the other jobs necessary for us to win and we can
do this job too.
<p>Come, fellow workers. All together. Our shoulders to the wheel. Let
us build a real union, a strong union, with all members understanding exactly
what a union means and how to fight for the union in the shop. .And then
the bosses can never beat as. We shall show the whole world how the Passaic
textile workers fight&#8212;and win.
<p>Not a single worker for the boss but all the workers for the union.
Every union member taking part in all the union activity and business.
Everybody in the district membership meetings.

<p><b><font size=+1>The Subway Strike</font></b></center></p>

<p>Some 1500 motormen and switchmen in the New York subways have gone out
on strike.
<p>This has brought out the same police force as in all strikes. The cry
of &#8220;law &#8216;n order&#8221; is raised just as Baker in Garfield parrots the phrase.
The strikers are orderly, but the master class has called for 6,500 extra
police to club the fifteen hundred strikers.
<p>The men went out for increased wages and more decent hours. The wages
for motormen is on an average $35 a week. They want to live, just as the
strikers in Passaic want to live. That seems to be a crime nowadays.
<p>Mr. Quackenbush, spokesman for the company said, &#8220;We will pay ten dollars
an hour to recruit men to take the places of the men who leave.&#8221; <p>That sounds familiar. The bosses in Passaic are paying millions to break
the strike.
<p>There is a company union for the subway workers, of course. This company
union is just like the one in the Forstmann-Huffmann mills. It is for the
bosses and not for the workers.
<p>Now the subway workers have decided to quit the company union and have
one of their own. The company union has skinned them of everything. Just
as in Passaic.
<p>We give our hand of fellowship to the striking workers in New York.
May they win the strike. And may they have their own strong union&#8212;a
union of the workers.

<p><b><font size=+1>Your Mistake, Doctor</font></b></center></p>

<p>The board of estimates yesterday refused for the second time to grant
permission for a tag day for relief of textile strikers in Passaic, N.
J. Mayor Jackson, employing either deliberate or unintentional sarcasm,
told Dr. Mercer Green Johnston the request would be &#8220;given official consideration&#8221; if the mayor of Passaic asked for help. The average school child, if he
reads the newspapers, knows the entire city administration of Passaic would
enjoy nothing quite so much as to see all the strikers starve to death.
<p>Tag days, as an institution are becoming a nuisance. And that&#8217;s just
the point. You may be sure that if the request had been made for a tag
day for the starving Eskimos in the Sahara Desert or for a fund to buy
wheel chairs for crippled canaries or for campaign funds for the Democratic
party, the board of estimates would have granted permission with three
loud and enthusiastic cheers.
<p>But Dr. Johnston made the mistake of going before our board of estimates
for a really worthy cause.

<p><b><font size=+1>Textile Operatives Hold Convention</font></b></center></p>

<p>The American Federation of Textile Operatives held its eleventh annual
convention in Lawrence, June 30 to July 2 at which over sixty delegates
were present coming from 23 different cities, representing most of the
organized textile workers of the New England states.
<p>President James Tansey called the convention to order and handled the
procedure in masterly manner.
<p>After the credentials committee had reported, the convention took up
the matter of two representatives from Passaic, Alfred Wagenknecht and
J. O. Bentall. Brother Wagenknecht was given he floor in behalf of the
relief committee of Passaic, and presented the needs of the strikers in
a most telling way, which the convention gave wholehearted and unanimous
approval. He showed how the Passaic strike had prevented a cut in wages
that had been contemplated in the Eastern mills, notices have already been
posted, but taken down after the battle in Passaic had begun.
<p>Wagenknecht showed the wide influence of the strike, and made it clear
that it was not only of local and national importance, but the textile
mills in China were operated by British and American owners. He presented
the need of full cooperation in the coming months, and his address was
cheered and a vote of thanks was given at the close of it.
<p>Bentall was seated as fraternal delegate from Passaic.
<p>Secretary E. G. Batty gave an encouraging report of work done during
the year. This report showed progress all along the line and indicated
a healthy condition in the union.
<p>In the discussion on the tariff, it was pointed out that the tariff
is of no benefit to the workers, but that it gives the mill owners a chance
to reap big profits. Instead of raising the wages of the workers, the bosses
have cut them to the very lowest level. One of the delegates showed that
broadcloth woven in England and sent here sold at the same price as the
same cloth produced in the United States, and that the Workers of England
received $35 a week for producing it, while the workers in our mills received
$18 for doing the same work.
<p>Brother Zelms of Boston, representing the International Labor Defense
was given the floor, and in a ten-minute talk brought the convention to
its feet in defense of Sacco and Vanzetti. The case was most enthusiastically
supported by the convention.
<p>The organization of the unorganized was taken up and plans for intensive
work among the non-union workers were laid.
<p>A strong resolution for a Labor Party was presented and the convention
went on record unanimously for this resolution, calling for independent
political action for the workers, severing themselves from the two old
capitalist parties and setting out to build a powerful party of their own.
<p>The old officers were re-elected and a strong executive committee was
chosen.
