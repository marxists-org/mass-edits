<h2><center>Bolshevism, Fraudulent Practice Of Democratic Centralism</h2>
<br />ByAlbert Weisbord
<br />(From the Magazine &#8220;La Parola del Popolo&#8221; November/December 1976)

<p>AS FIRST stated, the theory of democratic centralism, as the functional method of a political

party, was based on the following reasoning: Social revolutionists needed not a mere

parliamentary organization but a party of action which would function as a scientific body of

direction, a vanguard of activists tied to the revolutionary masses, and a central control organon.

The party should be An elite body of professional revolutionists dedicating their lives to the

cause and carrying out their decisions with iron discipline. No task too small; no sacrifice too

great.</p>

<p>Such a party could not be built from the bottom up but only from the top down. First, the

scientific leadership would show the way, formulating the program and policies, educating the

people, and working out the strategy and tactics. Advanced dedicated workers could join such a

party and carry out the decisions. In Russia, under the despotism of the Czar&#8217;s police, political

activity had to be carried out secretly. Full democracy by the rank and file membership was

practically impossible to attain but, organized in small groups, the members could develop

confidence in each other in the limited actions undertaken. Mutual confidence was far more

important than voting since the lives of all might depend on the confidence each had in the other

in the field. Some discussion in the political unit, or cell, might be attempted but, once a decision

was made, unity in action and stern discipline was insisted on.</p>

<p>Persisting in such concepts, the Bolsheviks, under Lenin, formed a separate faction and split from

the larger group of socialists forming the Social Democratic Labor Party of Russia. The leaders

of the faction claimed leadership because they had elaborated this theory of the party and its

functioning. The leaders of the Social Democrats (such as Plechanov, Martov, Petressov,

Axelrod, Lenin, Trotsky, Lunacharsky, Zinoviev) were practically all intellectuals who, after a

few brushes with the police, had to leave Russia to live in other countries of Europe. The

discussions among the leaders were held abroad, even though there was great difficulty for others

living in Russia to find their way to the gatherings or conventions. Among the leaders in exile,

democratic discussion was axiomatic, but in the Bolshevik faction, once the leaders had decided,

the rest (back in Russia) had to carry out the decisions. The statements issued by the emigre

center was the law! If you didn&#8217;t like it you could leave the Party!</p>
<p>The emigre Party leaders could declare that their leadership ability had been tested in struggles

against the Czar, as their forced exile abroad testified, but the fact was there was not too much

testing in the field. In a few cases the exiles had participated in some demonstration and had been

arrested, jailed, and exiled. Thanks to the work of the Nihilists in Russia and to the mass power

of the socialists in Europe the mere existence of a single revolutionary spreading his ideas in a

city was enough to give the well-organized Czarist police the jitters. The person arrested,

imprisoned, and exiled could now understandably believe he was a &#8220;tested&#8221; revolutionary. But if

we define that term as one who has organized physical demonstrations of the toilers with a

thorough knowledge of strategy and tactics, there were relatively few who could be so certified. It

was, rather, that the aggressive ferocity of the Czarist police had singled them out, not that their

actions went beyond talk, which had brought them into exile. Their main heroism was on the

lecture platform, in the conference room, at the editorial desk.</p>

<p>All this meant that when the class struggles became more intense, and real battle were raging in

the strikes and demostrantions that followed, it could be revealed that these exiles had very little

experience in strategy and tactics to be the actual leaders in these events. They could analyze the

over-all political significance of the events and bring their views to the international socialist

conventions, but the militants in the field had to develop their own initiative, ingenuity, and

judgment to carry on the best they could.</p>
<p>When decisive world-shaking events occurred, such as World War I, the socialist &#8220;leaders&#8221; were

found sadly wanting. All but a few sections took a nationalist course, each supporting its own

national bourgeoisie in the frightful carnage. When the Russian Revolution broke out in 1917 the

Bolshevik leadership, except Lenin (including Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bucharin, Stalin), practically

capitulated to bourgeois pressure. Lenin had to threaten to leave the Party and denounce all these

worthies as strike-breakers and traitors in order to save the situation. In all this confusion the

system of democratic centralism remained and the leaders of the Party who had taken control of

an enormously strengthened organization could now enjoy their undisputed victorious way.</p>
<p>FROM the start of the Russian Revolution, democratic tendencies became the rage. Everywhere

there were meetings, discussions, voting. In the Soviets there was voting on all the vital issues of

the day, on programs set up by leaders of rival parties fighting for power. In this kind of struggle

a heavy advantage lay on the side of the Bolsheviks who, under Lenin, had long advocated a

centralist party. In 1902 &#8220;democratic&#8221; centralism had been advocated because of Czarist terror; in

1917 it was advocated because of the needs of the civil war. In the civil war the power of the

leadership was strengthened to an unheard degree.</p>
<p>But suppose the Bolshevik leaders made serious errors and the interests of the proletarian

revolution were not carried out? Then the centralism of the leadership might destroy the

democracy of the membership. After wrong decisions by the leadership there would follow the

insistence on iron discipline and rigid implementation in carrying out such wrong orders. Then

would come the further bureaucratization of the leaders, the creation of cliques and henchmen,

false communications between leaders and members, further serious errors, etc., until the

dictatorship of the proletariat or rule of the toilers would give way to the dictatorship of the party,

the dictatorship of the party to the dictatorship of the executive committee, the dictatorship of the

committee to the dictatorship of &#8220;the leader.&#8221;</p>
<p>An unforgivable blunder on the part of Lenin was his turning over of the control of the Bolshevik

Party to Stalin. After Lenin&#8217;s death, Stalin&#8217;s gangsterism become the chief weapon of centralism.

In their fight against Trotsky, the other leaders (such as Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bucharin, et al.)

supported Stalin&#8217;s gangsterism until, with Trotsky out of the way, Stalin&#8217;s gangsters could shoot

them in the back of the neck in the toilets of the secret police. &#8220;Democratic&#8221; centralism had

turned to plain &#8220;centralism&#8221; while Russia was run by Stalin&#8217;s decrees. Under Stalin, Russia

became a counter-revolutionary force. But let us not forget that Stalin came out of Lenin and

"democratic&#8221; centralism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Democratic&#8221; centralism, as developed by the Bolsheviks was as typical a Russian product,

adapted for Russian conditions, as the Bolsheviks themselves. The Bolsheviks can say: Is it not

true, as capitalism grows desperate, all communist parties will be driven underground and forced

to operate in clandestine fashion, with leaders co-opted by other leaders, and members deprived

of full knowledge to be able to vote correctly? Is it not true that civil war will burst out in all

countries and the trials of civil war demand iron discipline by all? Yes, indeed!</p>
<p>But what our Bolshevik apologists ought to mention is:</p>
<p>1. Forming a revolutionary party means testing members to see whether they ought to become

leaders. No leadership without being tested in the fire of the class struggle.</p>
<p>2. The leaders today will not have the privilege of running hundreds of miles way to safety as

exiles and emigres to control a party from abroad from another country.</p>
<p>3. Above all, internationally, there will be no national party controlling other party leaderships as

"grandfather&#8221; of an international Mafia!</p>
<p>As soon as the Bolsheviks could maintain a stable regime within Russia they immediately

attempted to form a new international movement under their control, the Communist

International, or Comintern. On the surface it seemed an attempt to extend the revolution all over

Europe and the rest of the world. The Comintern congresses could be held, and the international

center be maintained within Russia, with the Russians as the &#8220;tested leaders.&#8221; Under the theory of

democratic centralism the Russians would be giving the orders to all the parties which would

then have to carry out these orders with iron discipline.</p>
<p>The First Congress of the Comintern was called in 1919 at a time when Russia was in truly

desperate straits and the revolution had failed in Germany, in Poland, in Hungary, in Bavaria, and

elsewhere. It is not correct to assume that Lenin had created the Comintern basically in order to

extend the revolution. It is, perhaps, more plausible to believe Lenin conceived of the Comintern

as a needed international body to help defend the Soviet Union. From this nationalist point of

view it did not much matter whether all revolutions failed as long as they harassed world

capitalism and prevented it from destroying the soviets.</p>
<p>AT THE FIRST congress of the Comintern, held in 1919, it seems all the delegates, save two

journalists were from the Soviet Union. This did not deter Lenin from launching his manifesto

and later his theses and twenty-one points detailing what each national party would have to

pledge before being allowed the honor of joining with the Bolsheviks in a world Communist

Party. All recognized parties could send delegates to the Comintern congresses, provided they

could manage to get there, but the majority of delegates would have to come from the Bolshevik

Party which, under &#8220;democratic centralism&#8221; would hold complete control.</p>
<p>Complete control, of course, would mean:</p>
<p>1. Agents of the Russian Communist Party would have complete access to the national parties

files, secrets, and membership;</p>
<p>2. The Russians could use these parties for their &#8220;fifth column&#8221; purposes, if need be;</p>
<p>3. The Russians could formulate the programs, policies, practices, and procedures of each of

these parties, control their elections, and place their own men as leaders of each party;</p>
<p>4. The parties could be rendered completely subservient by money and other subsidies for their

many activities.</p>
<p>Lenin&#8217;s finesse can be guessed at by the fact that soon after the formation of the rules of the

Comintern, he developed his &#8220;New Economic Policy,&#8221; in which he urged foreign capitalists to

invest in Russia with full guarantees of being able to export their profits at will. It was urgent to

repair the terrible damage made by the civil war. It was vital to form communist parties abroad to

push this project, to threaten countries refusing collaboration with a future of continuous

harassment and political demonstrations and to promise collaboration with countries going strong

with trade investment in Russia. Later, Stalin, in his rude and course manner, would develop that

which Lenin began, as shown in dealings with Roosevelt and with Hitler (Lenin: <em>his aristoi </em>&#8212;Stalin: <em>hoy poloi</em>).</p>
<p>The spread of Bolshevism through the Comintern meant the dominance of &#8220;democratic

centralism&#8221; on an international scale, led by the Russians. The trouble with this situation, from a

revolutionary angle, however, was that the Bolsheviks, in order to lead, had not had a thorough

and intimate knowledge of the countries and people they were leading, and this the ignorant,

provincial, and nationalist Bolsheviks could not have. Did they really know anything of the

United States, of China, of Africa, or much of Europe? Locked up in the prison of Czarism, what,

indeed, could the Russians have known about countries and peoples abroad?</p>
<p>Thus, ignorant, arrogant, dictatorial Russian leadership, perforce, had to fail in each country,

prevent a genuine communist party from arising, use its control only for the advancement of

Russia, and finally destroy each and every revolutionary party and the Comintern itself!</p>
<p>What can the working class of the world learn from this debacle of Bolshevism in its practice of

democratic centralism?</p>
<p>1. We must agree that the revolutionary party must be an active vanguard organization with a

leadership tested in theory and in practice, coordinating all phases of the struggle of the toilers as

a class in every aspect of their lives and work. The proletarianization of the leadership goes hand

in hand with the intellectualization of the membership. Every member a leader; every leader

tested in struggle!</p>
<p>2. We must also agree that we must ultimately face fascist terror and civil war and build our

organization on the basis of small nuclei or cells making it difficult for the enemy to infiltrate and

capture.</p>
<p>3. What we must insist on, however, is the optimum development within the cell, fraction,

caucus, etc., of initiative, ingenuity, and judgment by each member in charge of a given aspect or

departments of work, depending on the priority given such work by the cell itself. The

organization and functioning of the base unit must be the basic task in the advanced industrial

countries of the world.</p>
<p>4. The insistence on an ideal &#8220;monolithic&#8221; party must be considered as a mask for the

dictatorship of a few in the party. Disagreements are to be tolerated without expulsion so long as

those disagreements do not represent opposite sides of enemy classes, can be resolved in a

fraternal manner, and unity in action in the class struggle can be maintained. The exaggeration of

differences so as to make it appear that each dispute is one calling for methods of class struggle

to be used to eradicate such differences, is, itself, a sign of opportunist or of sectarian

degeneration calling for remedial action by the members.</p>
<p>5. On an international scale, no domination or centralism by any national party, but each party is

to consider itself one among equals. Unity in action is to be chosen only when there is complete

discussion and understanding with statutes clearly reflecting these principles.</p>
