<p><b>******************************************************************</b>
<p><b>OUR ANSWER TO COMRADE TROTSKY</b></center></p>

<p><b>We have received the following letter from Comrade Trotsky which
we print with our answer.</b>
<p><b>Kadikoy, October 10,</b>
<br /><b>To the Communist League of Struggle,</b>
<p><b>Dear Comrades,</b>
<p><b>I have received several documents from you. I apologize that I answer
with delay and then in the German language. To write English would be too
for me much too big and too thankless a task. Now to business.</b>
<p><b>I cannot sympathize with your position. Your criticism of the League
seems to me one-sided, artificial and terribly exaggerated. You throw the
League in together with the Right, which means that you trample under foot
the necessary proportion in politics. You deride the publishing work of
the League, and you oppose it to &#8220;Mass action". Have you any mass action
whatsoever behind you? Before we turn to the masses we must build a principled
basis. We begin with a propagandist group and develop in the direction
of mass action.</b>
<p><b>Also your international connections, sympathies and half-sympathies
speak against you. While I cannot claim to be so initiated in present day
American affairs, yet I know well enough what the Landau group and other
similar groups in Europe mean. Tell me with whom you go and I will tell
you what you are.</b>
<p><b>The International Opposition cannot need two groups in America. Your
group is new, has but recently split away from the Right, goes against
the Left Opposition on many questions, and flirts with those elements that
split away from the International Left. Can you ask us to prefer you to
the American League?</b>
<p><b>You declare yourselves as adhering to the International Opposition.
Organizationally this is not so. So it can be taken only in the sense of
general solidarity of ideas. Now you must also put yourselves the question
of how this is to be expressed organizationally. In your letter to the
conference of the league you propose a united front, but without the leading
comrades. This is the famous &#8220;united front from below&#8221; which the Stalinists
practice (in words) towards the Social Democracy and the unions. At the
same time we fight the league because it will not employ the policy of
the united front. This does not really make a serious impression. Were
you really to hold any community of ideas with the Left Opposition, you
would have to bridge behind you to the league in common. This in no way
excludes inner criticism on the ground of a healthy revolutionary democracy..</b>
<p><b>With Communist greetings,</b>
<br /><b>(Signed) L. D.. Trotsky</b>
<center>
<p><b>---&#8212;---&#8212;---&#8212;---</b></center></p>

<p><b>November 3, 1931.</b>
<br /><b>Dear Comrade Trotsky,</b>
<p><b>We have gone over the contents of your letter very carefully. It
seems to us that in many respects you have not understood our position.</b>
<p><b>1. It is not true that we ridicule the publishing activity of the
American League (Cannon group). On the contrary, we have stated in our
general theses &#8220;The sole virtue of Cannon group is that it has published
the writings of L. D. Trotsky in this country.&#8221; We can truly say that is
your pen alone that has given the Militant what ever little circulation
and whatever value it has.</b>
<p><b>We thoroughly appreciate the necessity of starting with a propaganda
group. Every beginner knows that before we turn to the masses we must build
a principled basis, we must begin with a propaganda group. With what we
cannot agree is the failure to make the slightest effort to advance beyond
the propaganda stage, to be smugly content to remain merely a propaganda
group, to do nothing else but publish a paper. We do not oppose mass action
to publishing activity. Our position is that the Talmudic leadership of
the Cannon-Shachtman group does not wish to leave the quiet of the office
desk to do any independent work among the masses.</b>
<p><b>In all of our criticism of Cannon &amp; Co., we have constantly believed
it was we who really represented the spirit of your own viewpoint in insisting
the Cannon group go beyond publishing activity merely. We can only regret
that your present position of exile prevents you from obtaining the facts
concerning the Cannon group so that you remain ignorant of its true character.</b>
<p><b>The Cannon group leaders having condemned themselves to sterility
in practice show themselves sterile in theory. Posing as Communist leaders,
they have not even READ the basic works of Marx. Trying to oppose propaganda
to mass action as they do, they do not even have good propaganda. Attempting
to win good fighters from the Communist Party, they get mere college and
high school students from the petty-bourgeoisie. Denouncing the Party leaders
as mere puppets, they themselves refuse to take a decided stand on some
of the most important questions of the day (e.g. the Negro question) and
where they do take a stand they often commit gross blunders. Even when
they were in the Party the Cannon leadership has absolutely no record of
mass work after they became Communists.</b>
<p><b>Would it detract from the propaganda of the Cannon group if it formed
shop nuclei and shop committees, if it paid more attention to the actual
formation and guidance of trade unions fractions, etc., if it strove to
lead strikes or other demonstrations, etc? Does a group deserve to be called
anything better than a sterile sect when in the first two years of its
existence it issued not even one agitational leaflet mobilizing workers
in an independent manner?</b>
<p><b>You ask &#8220;Have you any mass action whatsoever behind you?&#8221; We believe
such a placing of the question very improper. We charge the Cannon group
with not ATTEMPTING to develop in the direction of mass action. You do
not seem to concern yourself whether our charge is correct or not but you
ask where is OUR mass action. Surely this is no defense of the Cannon group.</b>
<p><b>If you ask for our past we can declare we have a good record of mass
action. This record we have sent you. We believe it would be good if you
took more interest in the American movement. Of political mass action the
American working class has little experience, but in some of its many economic
battles we have done our share. It is our group and ours alone that raised
such an elementary slogan as &#8220;No leadership without Communist behavior
in the concrete struggles of the masses.&#8221;</b>
<p><b>If you are asking what we are doing at present we can only say that
we have the correct orientation, that is, we are ATTEMPTING mass work.
We have issued a number of agitational leaflets. We have participated in
various strikes. We have put out a shop paper and are building a shop committee
in a very important factory. We have entered into various united front
activities (Defense of Centralia Prisoners, Mooney Defense, etc.) in which
we alone upheld the banner of the International Left Opposition. All our
members are instructed to work in larger factories and no doubt this will
bear good fruit in the future. We have tried to do some independent unemployed
work and work against the high cost of living. We have entered whatever
political demonstrations take place. In short, we are doing the best we
can.</b>
<p><b>We have not limited ourselves to general criticisms of the Cannon
group. In our general theses you will find a long list of concrete facts
thoroughly exposing the Cannons and Shachtmans as having no place in the
International Left Opposition either by their past or by their present.
You write &#8220;Your criticism of the League seems to me one-sided artificial,
and terribly exaggerated". We ask by what right you reach these conclusions?
Have you been able to disprove any of the facts asserted in our theses?
If only half of what we allege were true, this would be enough to show
the Right-wing character of the Cannon group.</b>
<p><b>It is not too difficult for a Right-wing group to hide its character
under phrases of adherence to the International Left Opposition. The matter
is very simple. Let Turkey keep hands off American affairs, let the Cannon
group work under the cloak of Trotsky and the American &#8220;Cannons&#8221; will &#8220;agree&#8221; to anything that Turkey writes. It is cheap politics. You need but turn
to the thesis that was submitted to the last National Conference of the
Cannon group to see how barren , how opportunist, the theoretical views
of the Cannon group leaders are, particularly on American questions where
they are not mimicking your exact words.</b>
<p><b>2. You declare that our international connections, sympathies and
half-sympathies speak against us. We do not know exactly what you mean.
For over six months we tried to exchange correspondence with the Secretariat
at Paris. To this day we have never once received a reply. The Secretariat
is too proud, too bureaucratic even to reply to us. Instead they issued
a document against us that appeared in the Militant, that absolutely convinced
us that the Secretariat were merely a Parisian bunch of Shachtmans, triflers
in the revolutionary movement. Can we also not say, &#8220;Tell us with whom
you go and we shall tell you who you are?&#8221;</b>
<p><b>Under such circumstances what did you expect us to do? When we found
that there were other groups that attacked what was to us the proven bureaucracy
and stupidity of the Secretariat in Paris, we began an investigation and
we have written these groups to find out in full their differences with
the Secretariat. We are studying such documents as we have received but
we have not yet taken a stand on any of the questions raised by the other
groups. Our information is as yet too incomplete. Surely you cannot object
to this correspondence for you yourself in a letter to the Italian Left
(Bordiga group) wrote that it is the duty of each national group to connect
with an international tendency. What we are trying to do is to carry out
your advice. However, we are not yet connected with any group.</b>
<p><b>We believe that it must be kept clearly in mind that there is as
yet no common program worked out by the International Left Opposition.
We have your Draft Program and your various theses. In the main we agree
with these but they cannot be a substitute for a collectively worked out
program so that all can know where they stand.</b>
<p><b>3. You write that our group is new. This can be no reproach. One
must understand the conditions in the United States and in the Communist
Movement to appreciate the reasons why the views of the International Left
Opposition became known and were accepted so much later than they were
issued.</b>
<p><b>However, we must indignantly reject any charge that we have &#8220;but
recently split from the right". This statement alone shows how much a victim
you are to the lies of the Cannons and Shachtmans who have united with
the Communist Party bureaucrats to spread this slander concerning our group.
The members of our group do not all have the same political history. Two
members of our executive were expelled from the Communist Party for &#8220;Trotskyism".
Two have been expelled from the American League (Cannon group) for insisting
upon some efforts towards mass activities. We have some workers, never
before members of a communist group who have been won from the unions and
other mass organizations. Actually we have no members who were with the
Lovestone faction since its split from the Party in 1929.</b>
<p><b>As far as Comrade Weisbord is concerned, he broke with Lovestone
in February, 1928 when Cannon was then united with him. Cannon as the leader
of a tendency was never to the left of Ruthenberg. The struggle within
the Party never really exposed the completely opportunist character of
all the factions at that time. In Moscow at the 4th R.I.L.U. Congress,
comrade Weisbord definitely fought the representative of the Lovestone
Group (Gitlow) at that time. We can thus only view with amusement that
you can believe the fairy tales that were a part of the &#8220;Right&#8221;, meaning
the Lovestone group.</b>
<p><b>4. Finally we read with amazement your statement that we want a &#8220;united
front&#8221; without the leaders of the Cannon group. This is far from the truth.</b>
<p><b>It is not we who refused to join the Communist League (Cannon group).
It was the Cannon leadership which in reply to our draft theses (printed
in the Militant, 1930) declared we have no place in the Cannon group. It
was not we who refused to form a united front after we had been forced
to form another group. It was Cannon &amp; Co., who refused to even answer
our letters in which we offered to form a united front on a number of concrete
questions. We do not dictate to the Cannon group as to whom they should
send as delegates. If they send Cannon or Shachtman we will work with them.
However, we reserve to ourselves the right to declare that the movement
must be rid of the Lovestones, the Cannons, the Fosters, and the other
misleaders who have really disgraced our movement so long. We have tried
to build many bridges to the League. In each case they have been hacked
down by the leaders of the League, Cannon &amp; Co. When the National Conference
of the Cannon group was held we offered to send delegates and to present
our viewpoint to the conference. We pointed out that the delegation would
be a step forward in eliminating the barriers set up between the two organizations.
Our letter was not answered. Our delegation was rejected. The Cannon leadership
ruthlessly repressed any right of healthy criticism within the League.</b>
<p><b>We are quite willing that you should use your offices to bring together
the two organizations for mutual discussion of our differences and for
mutual action. We deeply regret that there should be two organizations
in the United States both adhering to the views of the International Left
Opposition. Only a clean up from top to bottom will give us a section of
the International Left Opposition that will not disgrace itself.</b>
<p><b>Comradely Yours,</b>
<br /><b>Communist League Of Struggle</b>

<p><b>THE SITUATION IN THE ILLINOIS COAL FIELDS</b>
<br /><b>by John J. Watt, (former President, National Miners Union)</b></center></p>

<p><b>(Editorial Note: We are publishing part of a letter received from
Comrade Watt late in September. We regret that due to the irregularity
of the Class Struggle, we could not publish this earlier.)</b>
<p><b>Due to the further gross blunders, the official party has entered
the fourth period, THE PERIOD OF ISOLATION. Not satisfied with the destructive
Third Period, which all but wrecked the party and its revolutionary unions,
to complete the job here in Illinois the Fourth Period of Isolation was
put into practice and TODAY you can&#8217;t find a particle of the National Miners
Union or the party, in the mining fields of Illinois with the strongest
lens possible. Doesn&#8217;t that mean that all militancy in the ranks of the
miners has ceased to exist? Not at all; more dissension and turmoil exists
today than at any time since I can remember, but due to past errors and
incapable leadership, the miners have lost complete faith in the Communist
Party and are following other leadership in the absence of Communist leadership.
The Stalinists isolated themselves from the Belleville rank and file movement,
actually ordered that no delegates should attend the conventions of these
groups and thus serve as leaders to the honest rank and filers who have
been caught in these maneuvers. They isolated themselves from the Edmondson
Rank and file maneuver, whose convention was 90% rank and filers looking
for a way out. Because of this program of isolation, when these groups
were finally broken up, the party was not in a position to take advantage
and to capture the best elements of these movements because it had adopted
a program that did not allow them to organize for such periods.</b>
<p><b>And now such opposing groups remain, in organized form, for due to
certain strategical maneuvers, promises and concessions, the miners in
Illinois for the first time in two years are again 100% paying their dues
to Lewis and Walker. Does this mean that harmony again exists inside the
old U.M.W.A.? No, it is more distant than before, but, as stated above,
certain tactic[s] were used by the Lewis-Walker forces that have made this
seeming harmony possible. The Lewis-Walker machine collaborated with the
agents of the government and the coal operators to kill the Edmondson Rank
and File movement completely. The court edict dissolved the Re-organized
movement, and after these things had taken place, elections to fill vacancies
that had not been filled because of the divisions that had taken place,
were held out as lures to the opportunistic remnants in the revolting factions.
Sub-districts and Board Member-districts that had been revoked or done
away with were again reinstated and the fact that the present wage agreement
expires next April was used very effectively to cement the breaches that
had been made between Walker and Lewis and their pleas for unity to met
the common enemy, the coal operators, had some effect. And this regardless
of the efforts of the Walker-Lewis gangs the last two years of doing everything
possible to cause disunity in order to aid their own private schemes.</b>
<p><b>Does this mean that complete unity now exists between Walker and
Lewis? No, Lewis is awaiting his chance to overthrow Walker, and at the
[least] this won&#8217;t be much over a year even if the old union remains intact
until that time. Perhaps Lewis won&#8217;t have to wait until the next election
to get Walker, because there is a convention of the Illinois Miners to
take place here in Springfield on October 6th and the battle grounds are
now being prepared to overthrow Walker. This convention call was the remaining
club that had the effect of causing the last remaining local unions to
pay their dues again to Lewis and Walker so that they could participate
in this convention and thus be able to&#8217; &#8220;clean-up Illinois".</b>
<p><b>A battle royal will take place there for control of the Illinois
union, Walker has nothing to gain and much to lose by the re-opening of
the Walker-Lewis injunction fight, and the charges of Lewis that Walker
and his henchmen are agents of Peabody Coal. Lewis is still prevented by
injunction from interfering in Illinois but the Lewis henchmen are busy,
the former supporters of Howat are busy, the honest rank and filers who
are opposed to both Lewis and Howat are busy, and it will not surprise
me if the most riotous convention ever held in the U.M.W.A. will take place
here when these different forces meet. But nowhere can we hear a chirp
from the National Miners Union or the C.P. at a time when with a correct
policy past mistakes can be wiped out and leadership given to any rebellious
movement that may develop at this convention.</b>
<p><b>So I say what can be done in the face of such a promising period
when the only real movement that has a solution for the system that created
all this turmoil, unemployment and starvation, remains aloof, isolated
and demagogic, expelling competent men from the movement, outcasting and
branding others with the brands of traitors, counter-revolutionists, and
opportunists, while at the same time, they [are] committing the grossest
kinds of errors, with proof in plenty to show that they understand not
a whit the duties entrusted to them, remain in full power, backed 100%
by the Comintern.</b>
<p><b>To all this we must reply that we will fight on against all odds,
knowing that the worsening of conditions, drastic wage reductions, unemployment
and world-wide starvation will bring the period when workers themselves
will assume leadership, undaunted by any clique, in the battle for self
preservation and workers rule.</b>
<p><b>Thanking you again for your letter of comradeship and assuring you
of my continued struggle against all enemies of the working class, I remain,</b>
<p><b>Yours for Ours</b>

<p><b>**************************************************************</b>
<p><b>MY EXPULSION FROM THE COMMUNIST PARTY</b>
<br /><b>(Concluded from the August-September Issue) by Albert Weisbord</b></center></p>

<p><b>Who were the people who had me charged with &#8220;Lovestoneism"? The very
ones who had been the worst Lovestonites, those who had formed the right
end of the Lovestone faction (Stachel, Weinstone, Minor and Co.) Stachel
could never forget how I had testified that he had tried to swindle the
C.I.&#8212;affirming that Pepper had gone to Mexico and trying to use the
evidence of my own trip to Mexico to prove it! As for the right-wing policies
of Weinstone, these had come thoroughly into the open in the 1926 Patterson
Strike where I had been forced into a head-on collision with his Menshevik
theories (June issue Class Struggle: Crucial Moments in Textile Strikes).
Inside the Lovestone faction it was the Weinstone-Stachel clique against
which I had been forced to struggle the most. When, due to the capriciousness
of Stalin, they were momentarily put at the helm, they were quick to seize
the opportunity to expel me.</b>
<p><b>Who were the people who charged me with &#8220;running away from the South".
It was again the Stachels and the Weinstones who never ran away from a
fight because they saw to it that they never had to come near one. The
Minors, who, Southern gentlemen that they are, would rather leave it to
the East Side Jews or Poles to organize the Southern workers? The Dunnes
and Johnstones who carefully avoid the scene of action or conveniently
arrive there too late and never take responsibility for the action! The
Browders who go through a Chinese revolution and learn nothing except that
Chinese textile unions sweep their floors clean! The Fosters who enter
a struggle only to make a speech or so, but who, when they were organizers
(in the far-off past) actually betrayed the workers (Foster record Steel
Strike, 1919)! Yes, these are exactly the people who levy the charges.</b>
<p><b>Was it correct for me to have tendered my resignation as the Central
Executive Committee textile representative? The Secretariat threatened
me with immediate expulsion unless I at once repudiated my resignation.
This I did. However, I stated:</b>
<p><b>"At the time I offered my resignation I felt that I had such serious
political disagreements with the present leadership that if I had not resigned
I would have to be removed and that with such opinions I could not maintain
the responsible party post of CEC textile representative and that under
such circumstance , especially since I was now leaving for the South, that
it would be better for a textile comrade to take hold of the post of secretary
of the union. It was clearly understood that the union change of secretaryship
must take place in such a manner that the union would not be hurt by such
a change. A previous telegram giving my position had been suppressed. I
was desirous of demonstrating my political disagreements in some manner
before leaving for Gastonia, due to the terror of the bosses I might never
have the opportunity again.&#8221; (Statement to Secretariat, June 19, 1929)</b>
<p><b>Of course, my tendering my resignation under the circumstances was
correct. If any criticism is to be made it is that I did not wait to organize
a strong faction inside the union, that I did not mobilize the textile
workers to fight the frame-up artists and puppets in the Party.</b>
<p><b>Once my suspension was decided upon, a frame-up was necessary to
put it over on the party and union membership. A whole regiment of &#8220;reasons&#8221;,
most of them pure lies and fabrications were &#8220;discovered.&#8221; It was discovered
that I &#8220;sold-out the Passiac strike.&#8221; It was discovered that I &#8220;hid on
a roof in the New Bedford strike.&#8221; It was discovered that I &#8220;had wrong
union policies&#8221;, that I had a wrong strategy in the South, a wrong policy
in Elzabethtown, that I had wrong defense slogans, that I was a pacifist,
a careerist , a syndicalist, a factionalist, etc., that I was for the bourgeois
democratic revolution in America (no less!) And for an opportunist labor
party.</b>
<p><b>The only part of these ridiculous &#8220;charges&#8221; which deserves words
to answer is that touching on policies. On the &#8220;wrong union policies&#8221; I
can say we never had a disagreement in the National Executive Committee
of the National Textile Workers Union on any serious question and none
on the South. The &#8220;rolling wave strike strategy&#8221;, proposed by myself, was
unanimously adopted by the N.T.W.U. And approved by the Polcom of the C.P.
itself. This strategy is in itself important enough for an article. Finally
as to the &#8220;wrong Gastonia defense slogans&#8221;, all I need to say is that at
the same time I was removed from all posts by the party leadership, no
defense slogans had yet been issued.</b>
<p><b>As for the charges of careerism, individualism, etc., are they to
be treated seriously? We ask the people who made these charges to show
us a single thing they did for the American proletariat to deserve the
posts they have. We ask them whether they ever did a thing without considering
"would it affect my job, my career". We are in our &#8220;1902 period&#8221; in America
for we have not yet really tested our leaders, because we are still infested
with the worst type of shysters and sharpers which our &#8220;1905 dress rehearsal
for the revolution&#8221; will clean out. Just as Lenin sounded the alarm in
1902 in Russia so must we today in the United States.</b>
<p><b>After my suspension from the Party I cabled an appeal to Moscow denouncing
the frame-up and demanding a trial and the right to appear personally in
Moscow. You see, I naively imagined that the crookedness and corruption
of the marionettes in the U.S. did not come from the Stalin-Lozofsky regime.
At that time I wrote that &#8220;the C.I. calls upon every party member to finish
what the C.I. has begun&#8212;the elimination of the present leadership fundamentally
vitiated by petty-bourgeois political tendencies and rotten diplomacy and
for the creation of a leadership actually tested in the fire of proletarian
struggles&#8230;&#8221; (Statement to the Secretariat June 19, 1929)</b>
<p><b>I was soon disillusioned. I learned through the New York Times that
the C.I. had expelled me. From the Imprecorr I learned the reason: It was
for WHITE CHAUVINISM ! No more, no less. The charges were made by Lozofsky
himself who demanded that I be thrown out of the Party &#8220;like a rag". What
are the facts?</b>
<p><b>1. I was the first to speak on the Negro question in the Gastonia
strike at the very beginning, raising the slogan of equality for black
and white workers. All the Southern papers carried the story of my speech
(Houston &#8220;Democrat&#8221;, Atlanta &#8220;Constitution&#8221;, etc.) Furiously denouncing
it and declaring this alone meant the N.T.W.U. would never have the slightest
chance in the South.</b>
<p><b>2. In the face of the terrific reaction that set in, our whole fraction
in the field capitulated on the Negro question, refused to carry out our
line, strung up a wire between Negro and White workers, etc. These capitulators
include some still leading the Party. The Polcom sent down Jack Johnstone
to correct their line, to stiffen them up, to take leadership. Within a
week Johnstone had run back to New York City&#8212;without permission. He proposed
in a written series of motions the N.T.W.U. build TWO UNIONS in the South,
one for Negroes, one for Whites, declaring that the Negroes themselves
wanted this! These outrageous proposals were supported by Browder. It was
I who took the lead in denouncing them. The Negro comrades sent a cablegram
to Moscow denouncing the white chauvinism of Johnstone-Browder. Johnstone
was yanked out of the South&#8212;for which he was desperately manoeuvering
- and I was sent down to carry out the line of the Party.</b>
<p><b>3. The first thing I did was to counteract the poisonous chauvinism
of Johnstone and Wagenknecht and to break the sabotage of the fraction
in the field. None of the organizers at first would speak to the strike
committee on the simple proposition of complete equality in the union.
I was left to do it myself. I had to get a vote in the Gastonia Strike
Committee. I had to go to Bessemer City to get a vote there. I had to call
the meetings in the Negro quarter. In order to get a little help I got
the I.L.D. attorney to make a five minute talk to the Strike committee
on the necessity of black and white to stick together. I worked out his
remarks and he told them in the Southern language to which they were accustomed.
All of the organizers admitted that I was successful in convincing the
majority of the Strike Committee.</b>
<p><b>4. What were the results? I got the Strike Committee to vote for
the proposition &#8220;Full equality in the union". For the first time white
men and women held a meeting in the Negro quarter standing side by side
with the Negro workers. It was a great move forward. Some of the comrades
now saw their error and began to help.</b>
<p><b>But as Party representative I was not satisfied with this. While
we now hammered home before the union &#8220;Full equality in the union&#8221; I laid
down a much more advanced program for the communists. As I wrote in a letter
to Beal soon after the strike began (Letter of April 20, 1929):</b>
<p><b>"On the Negro question, there must be absolutely no compromise. OUR
UNION STANDS AND FIGHTS FOR FULL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL EQUALITY
FOR ALL WORKERS INCLUDING NEGRO WORKERS. Further than that you as a Communist
and all leaders as Communists, must lead the way by personally fraternizing
with the Negro workers, making them your personal friends. While at UNION
MEETINGS it is not necessary AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME to advise the Southern
