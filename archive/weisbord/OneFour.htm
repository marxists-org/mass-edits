<br />(Thesis of the Communist League of Struggle)</center></p>

<p>1. The invasion of Manchuria by imperialist Japan marks a critical moment
in capitalist post-war history. It has shown most emphatically how correct
the Communist League of Struggle was in declaring, as it did in its general
thesis:
<blockquote>"11. &#8230;&#8230;.The world crisis most seriously intensifies the
uneven development of capitalism. The weaker countries become still weaker
and further penetrated by the leading powers. The debtor countries become
still more indebted, the colonies and semi-colonies still more enslaved,
the struggle among the leading powers still more intense.&#8221; <br />"12. A greatly increased political instability is one of the direct
results of the crisis. Here is the clearest indication of how transient
and ephemeral the much-vaunted &#8216;stabilization&#8217; of capitalism is. While
we do not declare that this is the final basic crisis of capitalism, yet
the political and revolutionary crisis in different parts of the world
make it plain that such a final crisis of capitalism is not out of the
question&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</blockquote>
2. The new aggressive acts by Japan are not due to a sudden change of policy.
On the contrary, they are but a culmination of carefully laid imperialist
plans, plans that date from the Russo-Japanese war, from the emergence
by Japan into a foremost world power. The seizure of Sakhaline, Korea,
various Chinese concessions, Kiaochow, and the Manchurian Southern Railway,
the all-rounded economic penetration of Manchuria and the support given
ruling Manchurian militarists, all show that Japan was but waiting for
the proper co-relation of forces in order to seize Manchuria outright as
one of her possessions as she has done to Korea.
<p>3. The Japanese militarists deem the present opportunity extremely ripe
to act. In the first place, China is in a state of terrible chaos. Famine
affects a territory covering some 56,000,000 people. Disastrous floods
have ruined some of the richest parts of China (Yang tse Valley etc.).
Constant civil war among the military generals has desolated the countryside
and shattered any central unified power by the Nanking Government over
all of China. Within the Nanking Government goes on a most corrupt and
unprincipled intriguing for power by the various cliques, urged on and
supported by the great imperialist powers (U.S.A., Great Britain, Japan,
France, etc.) The struggles of these militarists both within and against
the Nanking Government are only the forerunners of the open attempts of
the main imperialist powers physically to dismember and to partition China.
Such a partition would conceivably allocate the north of China to Japan,
the coast and central parts to Great Britain, and sections of the south
to France. Against these attempts stand two forces. On the one hand the
imperialists are divided amongst themselves. Each fears to disturb the
present equilibrium of forces in favor of the others. Particularly does
the U.S. oppose this partition at this time. Having come into China late,
having seized no large territory, having, on the other hand a great economic
superiority, and burdened with &#8220;democratic&#8221; and &#8220;non-imperialist&#8221; pretensions,
the U.S.A. supports the Nanking regime and temporarily fights for an &#8220;open
door&#8221; policy.
<p>The second great force opposing the partition of China by the imperialists
is composed of the Chinese people who in their revolutionary movements
have shown their hatred for all the military cliques and have raised the
slogan: OUT WITH ALL THE IMPERIALISTS FROM CHINA. This revolutionary movement
has now recovered from its crushing defeat in 1927. It is on the upgrade
again. The monetary crisis in China and the pressure of the world crisis
has enormously accentuated the terrible misery of the masses in the city
as well as in the country. Side by side with a rising strike movement,
a huge guerilla warfare led by Communists, is being successfully waged
in the interior of China covering at least six provinces and 30,000,000
people. All the forces of the Nanking Government aided by the imperialists
have not been able to crush this revolutionary movement.
<p>In the second place, Japan is forced into adventurous tactics in order
to ameliorate its economic position. The economic crisis has severely affected
Japan. Its one-sided economy, with its reliance on the production of silk,
and its relative underproduction of the means of production, has been hard
hit. A budgetary deficit exists. The rigid militaristic monarchical government
now faces an aroused working class. On the foreign front, Japan has received
many defeats. Its alliance with Great Britain has been broken. Its attempt
to raise its naval strength above 60% of that of U.S. has been frustrated.
In China it sees its influence on Nanking diminishing. A huge effective
boycott has been established in China on Japanese goods. Even within Manchuria
Japan has seen the Manchurian government move closer to Nanking. It has
seen its puppets lose in the fight to grab the Chinese-Eastern Railway
from the Soviet Union and Soviet trade increase with leaps and bounds within
Manchuria. More and more Japan, in spite of its strong position in Manchuria,
is facing stiffer opposition. Under such conditions the Japanese militarist
adventurers will deem outright seizure of Chinese territory necessary.
<p>These brutal adventures of Japanese imperialism are made all the more
inevitable by the form of government within Japan and the relationship
of class forces there. In Japan the bourgeois democratic regime has been
far from completed. In the saddle is an extremely reactionary military
landlord clique supporting the Bonapartist regime of the Mikado. It is
this unbridled military chauvinism that on all occasions rattles the sword
and welcomes war.
<p>In the third place, Japanese chauvinists conceive the present is ripe
for action because they do not feel they will meet with united foreign
resistance. During the present crisis especially the struggle for markets
has reached a most acute stage. Each nation literally wars against the
others. Acute political dissentions and conflicts at home mark the relationships
of the various capitalist countries, the rivals of Japan, to each other.
These dissentions among the capitalist nations give the Japanese imperialists
their chance. It is possible that such foreign resistance may become so
strong that Japan may be forced to yield. But such a retreat by Japan will
be merely temporary and will even sharpen all antagonisms.
<p>The present situation has again exposed the futility and bankruptcy
of the League of Nations. The League of Nations cannot solve in the least
degree the contradictions of capitalism. Far from stopping war, the League
of Nations only increases the danger of war.
<p>Nor does Japan believe that the Soviet Union will intervene to stop
the seizure of Manchuria. The Japanese robbers evidently count on the national-socialists
tendencies of the Stalin regime, on the fact that under the management
of the Soviet bureaucracy the five year plan is being counterposed to the
world revolution, and on the degeneration within the Communist International,
to prevent the Soviet Union from actively checking the Japanese colonial
expansion.
<p>4. The latest outrage of Japan, precludes as it is to a general dismemberment
of China by all the imperialists, should Japan be successful, must be resisted
with all the force of the Chinese toiling masses, led by the Chinese proletariat
whose vanguard are the Chinese Communists.
<p>War by the Chinese people against Japan is the only form such resistance
can take effectively. Such a war by the Chinese people against Japan can
only be welcomed by the toiling masses and proletariat all over the world.
A war by the Chinese people against Japan is not an imperialist war, but
a war of a colonial country against an imperialist aggressor. It is the
duty of the proletariat everywhere to aid and to support such a war with
all its might. (Lenin) Such a war would have a most salutary effect on
all the struggles of the oppressed colonial peoples for freedom (India,
Philippines, Korea, Siam, etc.)
<p>The victory by Japan over the Chinese people or Japanese seizure of
Manchuria and Inner Mongolia would be a terrific blow against every liberation
movement throughout the East. It would hasten the dismemberment of China.
It would result in a smashing attack against that part of China now under
Soviets and strengthen all the Chinese village reactionaries. Reaction
would triumph in Japan as well. The Japanese proletariat would be given
a severe blow. The military landlord clique would rule more firmly than
ever.
<p>Victory by Japan, on the one hand would intensify all imperialist rivalry
in China; on the other hand is a direct threat against the Soviet Union.
The imperialists still smart under the stinging defeat the Red Army administered
to the Chinese military generals and to imperialist diplomacy over the
Chinese Eastern Railway. The seizure of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia offers
imperialism a consolidated base of attack against Russian-Chinese trade
and against the Chinese Eastern Railway. It is a thrust to split Siberia,
a menace to Outer Mongolia (under Soviets), a move at Turkestan, and a
threat of outflanking the Communist forces within China. Victory by Japan
imperils the whole Soviet Union, the Workers Fatherland. Against such a
victory the proletariat of the world led by the Communist International,
must fight.
<p>5. In all their actions regarding the Sino-Japanese conflict the Communists
must start from the understanding that the Chinese people must be supported
against Japan. The Chinese Communist Party must take the lead in demanding
support and in mobilizing the masses for war against Japan. But war against
Japan must be only a starting point. In its seizure of Manchuria and Inner
Mongolia Japanese imperialism but carries into action the fondest dreams
of other imperialisms, especially that of the U.S.A. War against Japan
by the Chinese people must be coupled with the demand that ALL IMPERIALIST
POWERS GET OUT OF CHINA. War against Japan must be a prelude to driving
out all the imperialist powers, including the U.S.A. from Chinese soil.
<p>The Chinese proletariat and Communist movement must thoroughly keep
in mind that the puppet imperialist tools which compose the Chiang Kai
Shek government can struggle effectively neither against Japanese nor against
any other imperialism. War against Japan must be linked up with a drive
to exterminate the Chiang Kai Shek Nationalist Government. Not the mercenary
armies of Chiang Kai Shek but only the armed people can drive off the Japanese,
the American and other bloodhounds. An armed Chinese people can make impossible
any seizure by imperialists of extensive Chinese territory. The Chinese
Communist Party must lead this struggle of the masses.
<p>The demand to arm the Chinese toilers must go hand in hand with the
demand for the convocation of a real Constituent Assembly, truly representative
of the oppressed Chinese people. The struggles against Japan must be a
struggle for the carrying out of a revolutionary agrarian program, for
the legalization of the trade union movement, for the eight hour day, and
social insurance for the workers, etc. War against Japan must be combined
with civil war in town and country for Soviets. This combined struggle,
starting with a vigorous boycott and confiscation of Japanese property
and that of their agents, must end with the confiscation of all imperialist
and capitalist property and a proletarian Soviet regime.
<p>6. The proletariat of the whole world must support the Chinese masses
in their war against Japan and other imperialists (U.S.A., Great Britain,
France, etc.) First and foremost does the duty fall upon the proletariat
of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union as the first victorious proletarian
regime has the unconditional duty to aid the proletariat and the oppressed
peoples of the world.
<p>As we have stated in our general theses:
<blockquote>"4&#8230;..The Soviet Union with its tremendous economic and political
weight will be able to throw this weight at times so as to help break the
economic and political power of different sections of the international
bourgeoisie at critical moments.&#8221;</blockquote></p>

<p><br />In the first place, the anti-Soviet aims of Japan and of the other
imperialists must be clearly exposed. The proletariat of the whole world
must rise to the unconditional defense of the Soviet Union. Such a defense,
in turn, calls for unstinted aid to the Chinese masses. Material support
of all kinds, to the maximum must be given the Chinese masses in their
struggle for liberation. The right to give this support must be defended
at all costs, BY MILITARY FORCE IF NECESSARY.
<blockquote>"4&#8230;..Today there has been raised to hitherto unheard degree
the decisive importance of revolutionary organizations; first as factors
maturing (creating) revolutionary situations, and second as factors changing
revolutionary situations to actual revolutions (insurrections)&#8230;.&#8221; (see
general theses). These principles apply precisely to the present situation.</blockquote>
The aid of the Soviet Union to the Chinese people can be that act which
will move the world revolution to a higher plane. The combined Chinese-Russian
revolutions can not only defeat Japan but overthrow all the military cliques
(Nanking, Canton, Wang Chin Wei &#8220;Left&#8221; etc) and drive out all imperialism
from the colonial countries. It can be that stroke that can turn the economic
crisis into the final basic crisis of world capitalism.
<p>The aid of the Soviet Union to the Chinese masses, leading as it may
to a declaration of war by Japan on the U.S.S.R. may well lead to a general
conflagration and world war. In the beginning, war by Japan against the
Soviet Union may find the imperialist nations split. However, it is far
more probable that the other imperialist countries, especially the United
States, will patch up their differences enough so as to unite against the
Soviet Union. Should the Chinese people be successful against Japan and
in overthrowing the Chiang Kai Shek government, and move against all the
imperialists, there can be no question that a joint imperialist military
attack will be launched both against the Chinese people and the Soviet
Union both in Asia and in Europe. The inevitable capitalist attack will
have been launched.
<p>Under these circumstances only the firmest sort of Communist leadership
and international policy can save the day. It is clear that the Soviet
Union rests not only upon its gigantic internal strength but fundamentally
upon the international proletariat. Those who have lulled the militant
sections of the proletariat with theories of &#8220;peaceful co-existence&#8221; of
the U.S.S.R. and the capitalist world, those who have developed national-socialist
tendencies (Stalin and Co.) must be pushed aside. The proletariat must
demand the reinstatement of L.D. Trotsky and his competent colleagues into
the leadership of the proletarian forces. Only the internationalist policies
of the Left Opposition can lead the proletariat successfully.
<p>7. The international proletariat and Communist movement must raise the
demands: ALL AID TO THE CHINESE TOILING MASSES-OUT WITH ALL IMPERIALISTS
FROM CHINA. DEFEND THE SOVIET UNION. Should there be a war against the
Soviet Union by Japan alone or by Japan together with other countries (for
example, the United States) all forces must be directed to aid our Fatherland,
the Workers Republic of the Soviet Union, and to change the imperialist
war to civil war against the capitalists at home.
<p>8. The proletariat and Communists in the United States have a particularly
grave responsibility. First of all the working class must demand: HANDS
OFF CHINA BY THE IMPERIALIST PLUNDERERS&#8230;..STOP THE DISMEMBERMENT OF CHINA.
But the American proletariat must go further than this. It must demand
the IMMEDIATE RESTORATION TO THE CHINESE PEOPLE OF ALL CONCESSIONS SEIZED
BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. It must demand the IMMEDIATE LIBERATION
OF THE PHILIPPINES AND OTHER COLONIES OF THE UNITED STATES and aid revolts
there. It must explode the hypocrisy and chicanery of American pretensions
and must thoroughly expose the imperialist aims of the United States Government.
It must fight against the U.S.-Nanking or other militarist alliances and
must raise the cry DOWN WITH THE NANKING AND OTHER MILITARIST PUPPET CLIQUES.
<p>Secondly, the American workers must raise the slogan: FULL AID TO THE
CHINESE MASSES (ESPECIALLY THOSE IN SOVIET CHINA) IN THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST
IMPERIALISM (Japanese, American, and others). Supporting the Chinese people,
the working class must demand the complete prohibition of Japanese trade
to this country. Simultaneously the workers must demand that large military
supplies be given the Chinese people (Soviet China). The shipment of these
supplies must be defended at all costs even if necessary WITH THE WHOLE
ARMED MIGHT OF THE NATION.
<p>9. Due to conflicting imperialist interests in Manchuria war may result
between the United States government and Japan, especially if the Soviet
Union has not yet entered the conflict. It is clear that such a war between
the United States and Japanese governments will be a war between two robber
governments over the question which shall rob and plunder China. It is
clear that the American government reeking with the blood of the Chinese
masses cannot aid the Chinese masses. Not in the least fooled by the hypocritical
phrases that will be employed by the United States government, the American
working class must do all in its power to overthrow United States capitalism
just as the Chinese toilers must overthrow Chiang Kai Shek and other military
cliques. Only a workers government in the United States can effectively
war against Japanese imperialism, can effectively support the Chinese and
Russian revolutions.
<p>War with Japan must not mitigate the class struggle at home. It must
intensify the class struggle eventually to reach the stage of a struggle
for state power. As a preliminary stage to this final struggle, the working
class must demand the arming of the working population in time of war,
the confiscation of all war industries and workers control over these industries,
a 100% inheritance and profit tax and an extremely heavy general capital
tax. Hand in hand with these demands must go the strongest demand for the
immediate recognition of the Soviet Union and the extension of material
support including the shipments of arms and munitions, in the largest possible
way. We must demand that these shipments be fully protected so as actually
to reach their destination.
<p>We say clearly that no Communist organization can support the American
capitalist government in either peace or war. In raising the demand for
the support of the Soviet Union or the Chinese Revolution, the Communists
strengthen those forces which will aid in overthrowing United States capitalism.
Should the United States government declare war against a country warring
against the Soviet Union or Chinese Revolution, it is the duty of the Communists,
while not opposing such a war, to overthrow the United States imperialists
and to establish the proletarian dictatorship.
<p>Unless the workers take over power, the war of the U.S. government against
Japan will be a war between two imperialist forces. In such a case the
American soldiers must aid the Chinese people to defeat both American and
Japanese imperialists. The American soldiers must fraternize with the Japanese.
Both must refuse to shoot down each other or the Chinese people at the
behest of their officers, and must take over control of affairs themselves.
<p>War between the United States and Japanese capitalist governments may
have two sets of results. On the one hand, it would tend to strengthen
reaction at home and abroad. If prolonged up to a certain point, the war
would liquidate the world economic crisis (by the enormous destruction
of goods it would entail) and would give serious blows to the proletarian
movement all over the world. American capitalism and its agent the U.S.
government would not enter the war to free China. On the contrary, the
American government intends to crush the Chinese even more completely.
The American proletariat must struggle against these imperialist aims.
<p>On the other hand, it is clear that such a splitting of the world imperialist
forces can objectively aid the world revolution. It can relieve the pressure
upon the Soviet Union. It can produce civil war within the warring countries.
It can result in the stimulation of a tremendous movement for liberation
in the colonies. In dismembering China, Japan is in a sense the representative
and champion of all the imperialist robbers. If these robbers fall out,
the result may be in the end no robbery at all. For Japan to be defeated
by the Chinese people who may be partly aided by other imperialists, can
well result in a checking of all imperialism. This defeat of Japan can
come about only if both the American and Japanese proletariat together
with the world proletariat aid the Chinese people in every way.
<p>However, the participation of the Soviet Union would change completely
the character of such a conflict. The entrance of the Soviet Union would
strengthen all the forces of civil war of the toilers against their governments
and oppressors. To carry on this civil war, to aid the Soviet Union would
be the foremost task of the European and world proletariat. The proletariat
of the United States can not be opposed to a war against Japan where Japan
wars against the Soviet Union. All the more must it be the duty of the
U.S. working class to see that it and it alone controls the government,
that enters the war, to insure full support to the Soviet Union and the
Chinese and colonial revolutionary movements.
<p>10. An extraordinarily difficult task lies before the Japanese proletariat.
Ruled by an all-powerful military caste allied with the bourgeoisie, relatively
weak and untried, the Japanese proletariat must check the Japanese imperialist
and transform the war into civil war. It must aid the Soviet Union. It
must refuse to shoot the Chinese. It must fraternize with the American
soldiers and both must agree not to shoot each other. The Japanese proletariat
must do all in its power to stimulate revolt in Korea, Formosa, and in
other Japanese colonies. It must work for the defeat of its government
and for a Soviet regime. Just as the American workers must intensify their
struggles at home, so must the Japanese.
<p>11. The present critical moment demands all the more the building up
of all the forces of truly internationalist Communists into a solid international
grouping. Now more than ever must the opportunist position of the Stalin
bureaucracy and its puppets in the United States and the various right
wing Communist leaders be exposed. Now more than ever must a fighting Communist
movement be built up in America.
