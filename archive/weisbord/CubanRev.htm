<P align=center>Perspectives of the Cuban Revolution</FONT>
<br /> <FONT face="Times New Roman"> By Albert Weisbord
<br />(From the magazine <em>La Parola del Popolo</em>, January 1962)</p>

<p>IN MY ARTICLE &#8220;What&#8217;s Going on in Cuba?&#8221; written almost two years ago 
and printed serially in 1960 in <em>La Parola del Popolo, </em>I pointed 
out that the doctrine of permanent revolution would apply to Cuba in the sense 
that the workers and peasants, once tasting power and understanding what it 
means to work for their own benefit, could not and would not willingly be 
prevented from taking full control especially since there was no force in Cuba 
capable of stopping the revolution from steadily moving forward. The July 26th 
Party Jacobin type leadership would have to give way to a more proletarian type, 
even though this would entail a split within that party and perhaps a fusion 
with elements within the Communist Party of Cuba. Much of what I wrote then as 
viable has indeed become realized.</p>

<p>Cuba is now in a new stage of development. Thanks to the horrendous policies 
and actions of the United States Government, Cuba has moved directly into the 
Soviet orbit. She has broken entirely with the U.S.A. economically and 
politically and, indeed, directly inspires an anti-U.S. movement in all of Latin 
America. She has announced as her goal the creation of a proletarian State 
trying to build up a truly socialist society. The Party of July 26th has now 
fused with the Communist Party.</p>

<p>What are the economic and political perspectives entrained in this new and 
higher stage of the Cuban Revolution? This is the important question to which 
the present article is devoted.</p>

<p>1. There is no economic reason why Cuba can not complete the building up of 
the socialist economy which she began with the revolution. In the first two 
years of her agrarian revolution she already has confiscated all the big estates 
and haciendas and nationalized the land. Of the total of more then 700,000 
caballarias of cultivated land in Cuba, 290,000 caballarias are now cultivated 
as state farms and cooperatives, 270,000 caballarias by peasants owning less 
than 5 caballarias each and united in the National Association of Small 
Producers (ANAP), while 140,000 caballarias are operated by proprietors of farms 
ranging from over 5 to 30 caballarias each. (A caballaria is about 33 
acres).</p>

<p>The large rice plantations, as well as the cattle ranches, have been turned 
into state farms; the sugar plantations into cooperatives run by agricultural 
workers formerly employed by the sugar firms. Thus about 115,000 working people 
immediately joined the cooperatives. Large numbers of landless workers and 
share-croppers have been given the smaller parcels of land enumerated above.</p>

<p>From the proletarian point of view this situation is not entirely 
satisfactory. The large numbers who have become members of the sugar 
cooperatives were formerly wage workers, that is to say persons who did not own 
the means of production themselves. Now they have been transformed into 
cooperative property owners and, as cooperators, must deal in terms of property. 
This is not a step forward but a step backward. (In Russia cooperatives were 
formed from peasants who had been bound to the soil from time immemorial and had 
never been part of the working class. For such elements cooperatives were a 
great step forward in tying them with collective means of production being 
formed all throughout Russia.) The sugar &#8220;cooperators&#8221;, formerly landless 
workers and part of the agrarian proletarian in Cuba now have been torn aside 
from the rest of the Cuban working class and put into a special category where 
they are as much like peasants as they are like workers.</p>

<p>As the proletarian revolution moves forward, these sugar &#8220;cooperators&#8221; should 
enter the agrarian trade unions and become part of the regular agrarian 
proletariat. The sugar plantations should not be kept apart from the sugar 
refineries but both should be fused into one entity. If the State runs the 
refineries it should run the sugar plantations as well, or if this is too great 
a jump at the moment then it is the sugar workers industrial unions that should 
take over the sugar plantations and not agrarian workers turned back into 
peasants.</p>

<p>In Cuba producers cooperatives have not as yet apparently been formed, just 
where they are most important namely among the poor farmers who are individual 
owners of land. Here is where the cooperatives have a progressive and 
flourishing role, to bring individual operators into the stream of social life. 
And here, again, the cooperative can only be a transitional form for a higher 
and more socialized form of operation. Should Cuba become more industrialized by 
processing, preserving, canning, and manufacturing food products, these latter 
operations should be tied up closely with the actual production of the 
agricultural raw materials so that, as far as practicable, the two can become 
entities as closely intertwined as the sugar fields and the sugar refineries. 
Thus the individual producer can be moved from individual actions, through local 
cooperatives, into broad collective operations that will tie him directly to the 
interests of the working class as a whole.</p>

<p>In the field of industry, already all the chief industries have been 
nationalized and the open enemies of the Revolution ousted completely. This 
field includes the production and refining of petroleum, the telephone and 
electric company, the large sugar refineries, the chemical industry, ore-mines, 
railways, rubber factories, factories making glassware, canning plants, soap 
plants perfumery plants, tobacco plants, textile mills, etc., as well as certain 
public utilities. By the fall of 1960 this process has become practically 
completed. To cap it all it has now been decreed that the estates of all those 
who have fled the country are also to be confiscated. Already 80% of the gross 
industrial product is accounted for by nationalized concerns.</p>

<p>There is no internal reason why Cuba can not go ahead with her Five Year 
Plans and industrialize herself in an all-rounded manner along the lines already 
set by socialist economies elsewhere. In February, 1961, a Ministry for Industry 
and a Ministry of Internal Trade were formed to help this process along. The 
Ministry of Trade is prepared in the import-export field.</p>

<p>The National Bank of Cuba directs the centralized banking system, controls 
the implementation of economic plans from the financial aspect and is gradually 
introducing the principles of planned credits and money circulation. The 
currency reform of August, 1961, has consolidated this role of the state banking 
system. The Ministry of Finance has been thoroughly reorganized and now carries 
out important functions in financing the plans. The General Planning Council has 
been assigned the task of drawing up Cuba&#8217;s first Four-Year Economic Development 
Plan for 1962-1965.</p>

<p>Of course, Cuba is not another Russia or China. She can not be a 
self-sufficient country except on the lowest planes of development. To 
industrialize herself and develop she will need aid from abroad, from the Soviet 
world, and here is where Cuba will have to become the supporter of Khrushchev or 
pay heavily and even fatally.</p>

<p>2. Let us now consider the new political scene. Khrushchev is now supporting 
Cuba economically, politically, and militarily. One of the conditions that he 
seemingly has laid down is the liquidation of the July 26th Party and its fusion 
with the Communist Party of Cuba. In agreement with this decision Castro has now 
"revealed&#8221; himself as a &#8220;Marxist-Leninist&#8221; so that he can become the 
leading figure in the new communist political organization that will rule the 
country. What will be the result of this &#8220;fusion"?</p>

<p>We should note first that the Cuban Revolution was not achieved through the 
instrumentality of the Communist Party of Cuba, which, indeed, for a long time 
got along very well with Batista and never, even as late as 1958, believed that 
Cuba would break away from the United States, no less build a socialist country. 
The Cuban Revolution, then, was won outside of and independent of the Communist 
Party by forces alien to that sterile sect.</p>

<p>Now that the Revolution has won the day and is proceeding with the full force 
of the Cuban proletariat behind it, the Cuban Communist Party wants to get on 
the bandwagon and take control. Castro himself is slated to become a secondary 
figure. Else why would Khrushchev have stated in a public speech that Castro is 
no Communist? If by &#8220;Communist&#8221; Khrushchev meant &#8220;Stalinist&#8221; in the image of 
Khrushchev, then, indeed, he was quite right. Be that as it may, it is clear 
that such words by Khrushchev indicated that in any fusion between the Castro 
group and the Communist Party it would be the latter faction that would be 
recognized as the more reliable, loyal, and understanding.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact should Castro not play the game as the Kremlin wants he 
is now in danger of being murdered by his own party members, by people of the 
Stalinist faction, as Trotsky was. There is always a Sormenti (Vidali) at 
hand.</p>

<p>And yet it is clear that Castro can never be a Stalinist, Khrushchev variety, 
even should he develop into a real Communist. No one of any heroic build who has 
himself fought his way to power without the aid of the Stalinists is going to 
knuckle down to that debased role. To prove this, history already has given us 
the cases of Tito, Mao Tse Tung, Hoxha and Ho Chi Minh who had much greater 
reason to knuckle under than Castro. Nor will Castro ever be content, so long as 
he is the leader of the joint Communist Party, to play a secondary role. He must 
be treated as an equal, not with contempt as a &#8220;new&#8221; communist or secondary 
figure. Indeed, the more successful Castro will become in his new role as leader 
of the communists in the Western hemisphere the more will he appear as a thorn 
in the side of the old line Stalinist-Khrushchev forces.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances what were the advantages to Castro outside of 
receiving help from Khrushchev that induced him to liquidate the July 26th Party 
and merge it with the Communist Party of Cuba? From Castro&#8217;s point of view the 
advantages were many&#8212;and let no one be misled to believe that Castro is not a 
very clever individual.</p>

<p>a) The July 26th movement was a local Cuban movement. It was not an 
international movement nor could it furnish an adequate base for such a 
movement. And yet it had become a direct necessity for Cuba for its own 
protection to build such an international movement in Latin America. The only 
revolutionary organization operating in all Latin American countries that could 
furnish such a base is the Communist Parties. As part of such a Communist 
movement Castro can now use these parties, their cadres, organizational bases, 
funds, and other supports fully and completely. Castro does not mean to be the 
leader only of the Cuban movement but of the movement in all Latin America.</p>

<p>b) By joining the Communist movement and taking a leading part in it Castro 
can build his own form and faction within it that might be able to learn all the 
plans proposed by the Stalinist-Khrushchevists and see that such plans did not 
hinder the spread of the revolution elsewhere in Latin America as they did in 
Cuba itself.</p>

<p>c) Castro, one may be sure, has not forgotten one of the primary lessons 
learned by the Cubans, namely that to achieve victory the working class must 
bypass the Communist Party as a sterile, non-Marxist, opportunist sect, 
incapable of taking revolutionary leadership. Stalinist Khrushchevism 
historically means elimination of proletarian initiative and destruction of any 
heroic party capable of seizing power substituting instead dull hacks trying to 
sneak into power, a la Stalin, by all sorts of deals and &#8220;maneuvers". In his new 
position Castro will be able to see to it that the Communist Parties elsewhere 
in Latin America will also be bypassed and that as in Cuba the workers abroad 
will be allowed to develop their initiative with their own forces.</p>

<p>d) By joining the Communist Party Castro will be in a better position to see 
that certain elements within that party are eliminated and removed from control 
in the factional fighting that must ensue. Furthermore, by such direct contacts 
especially with Khrushchev himself he will be able to deal more effectively with 
any attempt on the part of the Khrushchevs to stab the Cuban Revolution in the 
back by sacrificing Cuba for Berlin, for example, or for any other objective the 
nationalist communists in charge of Russia might concoct.</p>

<p>e) With Castro in the Communist Party the Soviet Union will not be able to 
bypass Castro in its efforts to influence Latin America. Cuba, not Mexico, will 
have to become the regional Latin American headquarters for revolution and all 
funds will have to be spent through Castro and his Cuban control. In Latin 
America already the principal cry is not Defend the Soviet Union, but Defend the 
Cuban Revolution. The Soviet Union is rapidly being forgotten as a direct 
revolutionary force in Latin America.</p>

<p>The big question is who will win out in the struggle that is bound to take 
place within the Communist Party of Cuba, the Castro group or the old sterile 
Stalinist hacks? This depends, in turn, on who will be able to win the workers, 
and this, in turn, depends on the political development of the workers.</p>

<p>From this point of view as well as from the point of view of the general 
welfare of the Cuban Revolution, it is absolutely essential to raise the 
question of general elections in which the workers and toilers will be entirely 
free to vote to make their choices and to participate actively in all government 
and political activities.</p>

<p>There is now only one party in Cuba, why should not there be elections? There 
is now a new proletarian state in Cuba, why should not there be a new 
constitution? Why should not <em>SOVIETS</em> be formed in Cuba as 
proletarian organs of power? The Stalinist-Khrushchevists who have killed the 
soviets in the Soviet Union of course have buried all of Lenin&#8217;s words not only 
in behalf of soviets as instruments for seizing power but soviets as organs of 
proletarian state power. Since Lenin&#8217;s day no soviets have been formed in any 
country controlled by Stalinists!</p>

<p>Or if there is to be no soviet regime in Cuba, should parliament consist of 
one chamber or two chambers? The Stalinist-Khrushchevists who have killed every 
form of working class direct control also killed the one-chambered revolutionary 
parliament in Russia. Should Castro come out for a new constitution with only 
one revolutionary parliamentary chamber he might even be called a 
Trotskyist!</p>

<p>How should the proposed elections take place? It is not necessary to deprive 
any class, except open enemies, of the vote, but if a dictatorship of the 
proletariat is to be firmly established, the working class should be given as 
many votes as necessary to effectuate its will and interests. Workers could vote 
in their shops AND in their unions AND in the communities where they live, if 
giving them THREE votes to the one vote of the shopkeeper or to the peasant were 
needed to control the situation. In a country like Cuba it would be easy to 
establish such election laws as would give the proletariat the decided majority 
in the legislative halls. <em>But the proletariat must now be allowed 
to vote and express its will.</em> What is Cuba waiting for? To wait 
further is a major crime against the people of Cuba? Working class elections can 
no longer be delayed! An advancing proletarian revolution can no longer tolerate 
this dictatorship OVER the working class.</p>

<p>In these working class elections, how can the activist Castro faction lose as 
against the old sterile Stalinist opponents? Such elections give Castro at last 
the opportunity to form a collective working class movement that will move away 
from the ideas of Jacobinisin to that of Marxism. After all, there is a direct 
historical line from Robespierre, to Baboeuf, to the Blanquists to Lenin.</p>

<p>Working class elections to the organs of state power will also mean working 
class elections within the governing party. For once the party will become a 
collective party which will not be dictated to by any outside forces not 
motivated by international proletarian considerations.</p>

<p>The transformation of the Cuban Party to a Marxist-Leninist one will have 
tremendous reverberations throughout the entire political world. especially in 
Latin America. It is the best guarantee that the Cuban Revolution will endure 
and remain permanently carrying out the interests of the working class to the 
end.</p>
