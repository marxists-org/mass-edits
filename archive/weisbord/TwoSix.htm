<p><b>ON THE BRINK OF CIVIL WAR</b>
<br /><b>(Germany&#8212;July 1932)</b></center></p>

<p>Ever more quickly the crisis draws to a head; ever more sharply the
class lines are drawn as the inevitable outbreak approaches. The Lausanne
settlement does not materially alter the situation, since the moratorium
has been in existence for a year, and there have been open declarations
that Germany would not pay in any case. Thus the Lausanne agreement recognizes
the existing situation rather than it creates a new one. The militarist
Von Pappen regime serves as a stepping stone for advancing the country
closer to the moment when the National Socialists must attempt to seize
power.</p>

<p>The Socialist regime, unable to bring political stability in the midst
of an economic situation of unprecedented strain, had to step aside. Its
day is done; its task accomplished. It saved the country from Communism
in 1918, when with machine guns it drove back the advancing Communist forces
trying to take over the factories. Since then it has protected German business
through some extremely difficult times: the starvation of the masses after
the war, the complete bankruptcy of the inflation period, the revolutions
of 1921 and 1923, and now the two and a half years of the crisis.</p>

<p>Step by step it has permitted the workers benefits and safeguards to
be reduced, under the burden of reparations, until hunger has reached almost
the breaking point. Unemployment according to reliable figures ( of the
Wirtschaftskurve, published in the Frankfurt Zeitung) is much higher than
generally supposed. It includes 50% of trade union members, with another
25% on part time. This means ten millions of people looking for work, and
five millions on part-time employment, out of a population of some 60 millions.
The suicide rate is twice that of the United States, and higher than that
of any other country. Yearly incomes tell the story of universal poverty.
Seventeen and a half millions of people have a yearly income of 1500 marks.
(equal to about $370) or less. Six millions of people have a yearly income
of between 1500 and 3000 marks (equal to $740). Only one million people
have a yearly income over 5000 marks(equal to $1200).</p>

<p>Yet the cost of living is not low. Prices of necessities for a workers&#8217;
family in Berlin show the astonishing fact that the German workers are
paying actually more for some items than workers in New York City. For
very few items are the prices lower. This when weekly wages are from five
to ten dollars, with the unemployed receiving much less.</p>

<p>In the face of these conditions the Von Pappen decree which went into
effect July 1<sup>st</sup> cut down the amount of social insurance by 23%,
with cuts in other categories of &#8220;crisis relief&#8221; and &#8220;welfare fund&#8221; 10%
and 15%.(saving a cool half billion marks for the government). A 2% increase
in taxes is thrust upon those employed, already heavily taxed. Support
for invalided soldiers is reduced,&#8212;and Germany&#8217;s expenditures for ex-soldiers
was already less than that of the U.S. with many more men involved. Salaries
of State employees are cut 4% for 5 years.</p>

<p>That the present regime is only temporary is clearly recognized, just
as it is recognized that within a few weeks&#8212;or at any rate very soon
--- the inevitable class outbreak must occur. The past two years have already
fully matured the forces which now await only the immediate occasion to
break loose. Daily the class lines are more sharply drawn. On the one hand
this is expressed by the dissolving of the conservative parties into the
Nazi battle front (already in last Spring&#8217;s elections the number of parties
was much reduced in comparison with two years ago.) On the working class
side it is taking place through the recent drawing together of the &#8220;Marxist&#8221; forces,&#8212;the united front of the Communists and Social-Democrats, occurring
for the first time since 1919.</p>

<p>The preparation of the Nazis, insofar as the mobilization of the population
is concerned, the organization of their own ranks, the securing the support
of big business, etc. has been going on most intensively during the past
year. The great advance in votes is but the indication of the reinforcement,
internal and external, of the movement. During this year the criminal weakness
and hesitation of the Communist Party, its refusal until very recently
to make the necessary alliance with other working class forces, has greatly
facilitated the Nazi advance. Under the most varied slogans, the National
Socialists have been able to win the wavering elements of the population.</p>

<p>Now for the National Socialists it becomes a question of immediate steps
preparatory to armed struggle: replacement of the Socialist police by Nazis,
taking over the army, taking over technical state positions, consolidating
the peasant alliance, bringing the Royalists into the field, etc. These
steps are envisaged by the Nazis and as far as possible are being approached.
The revocation of the ban against the Sturmabteilungen (Nazi Storm Troops)
greatly strengthens the Hitlerite position and intensifies the antagonisms
since it throws in to sharp relief that fact that the ban against the Red
Front Fighters has not been lifted. Yet the German workers are saying,
if the Nazis are permitted to have uniforms, they will have theirs. To
those active in its ranks, the National Socialists are giving three marks
a day and maintenance, which is of course a great factor in winning over
the unemployed.</p>

<p>The known support of the ex-royal family for the National Socialists
raises the question of restoration of the monarchy. The monarchy for Germany
meant a period of stability, of comparative well-being, of national glory,
the memory of which must appeal to all except to the class-conscious workers.
But this period is of the past. Germany&#8217;s productive machinery has been
rebuilt to a remarkable efficiency under the Dawes and Young Plans, this
excellent apparatus can function only under the terrible handicap of the
world crisis, that is to say, it cannot function. The Nazis may promise
through the Dritte Reich to bring back the old glamor of power, of German
supremacy. But it is well understood that whatever stability can be achieved
--- and such can be only temporary&#8212;can be brought about only by a terrific
blood-letting of the working class, only by the relentless crushing of
the Marxist forces.</p>

<p>That the possible Fascist regime would use the organizing ability as
well as the financial backing of the Royalists seems very probable. It
is just as probable that it would have the support and active participation
of some of the Social-Democrats (Let us not forget, Mussolini himself was
a Socialist once, belonging to a Centrist Italian faction). But as a form
of the capitalist dictatorship it would be quite different from the monarchy.
State capitalism has made rapid advances since the crisis. Only recently
the government has been forced to buy up the shares of the Flick steel
concern to prevent it from going into bankruptcy. So the government has
added another business, steel, to its list of banks, shipping and other
Industries which it now runs. Thus economically is laid the basis for the
possible Fascist state.</p>

<p>The most significant of recent developments is the adoption by the German
Communist Party of the line advocated many months ago by L.D. Trotsky .
Finally after criminal (let us hope not fatal) delay, the Communists are
calling for a united front with the Social Democrats and trade unions to
fight the Fascist menace. The great danger now is that following the tremendous
swing to the right which is now going on in the Russian Party, and in accordance
with the historical Stalin policy of capitulation in united fronts (China
1927, English-Russian Trade Union Committee 1926) the German C.P. will
become engulfed in this united front, will give up its independent stand,
will not put forward the necessary Communist slogans for the battle. At
a crucial moment like the present, such tactics would have the most disastrous
results. Already huge demonstrations of the joint forces have taken place.
A general strike is being planned. Breathlessly the outcome, so meaningful
for the workers of the whole world is awaited.

<p><b>Hoover &#8220;Disarms&#8221;</b></center></p>

<p>The Geneva &#8220;Disarmament&#8221; Conference, the long-heralded, and much prepared-for,
goes into recess with only another bag of wind as its achievement. If it
has any value, it is merely in so far as it sheds a revealing light upon
international relationships, and permits certain glimpses into the tricky
game of bourgeois world politics.
<p>Hoover&#8217;s proposals were not, as has been advertised, &#8220;hypocritical".
Most sincerely, indeed, did this watch-dog of Wall Street strive to serve
his masters in his clever&#8212;too clever&#8212;offers of partial disarmament.
Every provision was calculated so as to strengthen the position of the
U.S. and to handicap all rivals.</p>

<p>Firstly, from the point of view of international relationships, it is
plain that America dominates by her economic might, depending less than
other countries upon a mighty standing army and navy. Her problem, then,
is to disarm her rivals. If Hoover&#8217;s proposals had been accepted and carried
out, France, the financial and military mistress of Europe, would find
her continental hegemony, based on superiority of arms, broken. On the
other hand, a rapprochement was
<p>intended towards Germany, following upon the favorable attitude of the
United States in lightening the reparations burden upon Germany. (one can
always be generous where one has nothing to lose, and in this case, much
to gain.) Certainly to ease the burden of armaments of European countries
would increase whatever hopes the U.S. bankers have of collecting the enormous
war debts still due this country.</p>

<p>From the technical, purely military point of view, also, the Hoover
proposals were just as cleverly figured to favor the strong points in the
American armament situation. For example, no cut was proposed in big dreadnaughts,
this country&#8217;s specialty. But the enemies&#8217; specialties were to be cut.
Cruisers were to be cut, hitting England; submarines were to be cut, handicapping
France and Japan; Aircraft carriers were to be cut, aiming at both England
and Japan. To be sure no cut was proposed in the small American standing
army, which is after all, but a police army. Nor was manufacture of armaments
to be prohibited, for is not this America&#8217;s strong point, and is she not
equipped as no other country, to enter over night upon extensive manufacture
of armaments sufficient to sustain any war? The proposed cut&#8212;as of
course all armaments cuts proposed by all &#8220;disarmament&#8221; conferences ---
would merely prune away antiquated material which the nations would be
glad to scrap in any case.</p>

<p>Lastly, very interesting light is shed upon Litvinoff&#8217;s disarmament
plan (which this paper has dealt with at length in previous issues). Let
us not forget that Litvinoff also provided for partial disarmament in case
his proposal for complete disarmament (which would &#8220;eliminate war"!) were
rejected. To call Litvinoff&#8217;s offer &#8220;sincere&#8221; and Hoover&#8217;s &#8220;hypocritical&#8221; does not wipe out the great similarity of the two proposals and reveals
to the full the folly of the Soviet proposals, made without the least exposure
of the capitalist nature of war and war preparations. All police forces
and arms were to be kept in Hoover&#8217;s proposals (and, by inference, in Litvinoff&#8217;s
also) leaving ample forces for suppressing revolts and proletarian revolutions.
Specific provisions were made for &#8220;colonial&#8221; forces to keep the colonies
in the needful subjection. The fact that the Socialist International endorsed
Hoover&#8217;s proposals not only exposes the bourgeois nature of the Socialist
International, it gives one to think seriously also as to what is the true
character of Soviet diplomacy. The whole pacifist movement, which considers
partial disarmament a &#8220;step forward&#8221; is exposed as being at basis a bourgeois
movement, since the rankest imperialists, in the interest of the imperialism
of their own countries, can come forward with &#8220;peaceful&#8221; plans for partial
disarmament.

<p><b>Steel Worker Protests Stalinist Policies</b></center></p>

<p>The following letter has been sent us for publication by a comrade from
Youngstown, Ohio. We are not in agreement with some of the opinions expressed
in the letter. Our own view is given below.
<center>
<p># # # # # # # # #</center></p>

<p>The policy which the Left Communist Opposition under the Cannon leadership
has carried on from the very beginning is something new in the whole history
of the class struggle. This is the first time in the revolutionary movement
which a group of revolutionists refuse to do mass work because they do
not like to hurt the Stalinist feelings. On account of this ridiculous
and anti-communist policy of Cannon and Co. we missed the opportunity which
the objective conditions offer us for three years, to have a strong organization
all over the country, in a country with 40 million workers and where the
Stalinist party and their influence is very insufficient among the workers.
It is time for the L.O. to drop out that rotten policy and to quit being
the tail of the Stalinists.
<p>It is time for the L.O. to stop calling the Stalinist party &#8220;our party&#8221; (Cannon) and to stop calling what the Stalinists did in England 1926 and
in China 1926-27, what they do to the communist movement since 1924, mistakes.
We must expose the real character of the Stalinists to the workers the
world over. It is not mistakes to split the communist parties in every
country. It is not a mistake to unite with Chiang-Kai-Shek against the
Chinese workers, it is not a mistake to jail and murder the leaders of
the revolution and to replace them with Tzarist and Mensheviks (Martinov)
and so on. It is not a mistake to sabotage the revolution (Germany). Everything
the Stalinists have done in the last 8 years they have done not because
they did not understand the teachings of Marx and Lenin, but because they
did it purposely to keep the masses away from the Communist movement. Anyone
who thinks the Stalinists do not understand what Lenin said in the Second
Congress of the C.I. is a fool. Here is what Lenin said: The Communist
International should establish a temporary agreement, even an alliance,
with the revolutionary movement of the colonies and backward countries.
It must not however pull (?) with it, but must absolutely preserve the
independent character of the proletarian movement even if it is still in
embryonic form.
<p>For dear Comrade Cannon who for three years has been calling the communist
betrayals mistakes, these things are not plain enough to understand, though
it is plain not only for Mr. Stalin, Bukharin, Rykov, etc.&#8212;but it is
plain enough for anyone without any Marxist knowledge. The fact is, Mr.
Stalin never was a Communist and never will be. He is a plain egoist patriot,
he hates the workers and internationalism and revolutions, that is the
main reason why he exiled Comrades Trotsky and Rakovsky, and so on. The
Third International is dead since 1923 and under the present leadership
has done nothing but destroy the Communist movement. We must begin for
a Fourth International, and the sooner we all realize that the better it
is! The L.O. in this country under the Cannon leadership has become a group
of Stalinists No. 2., since they deny the right to express his opinion
to anybody who does not agree 100% with them. In the winter of 1930 I sent
a letter t o New York and asked them to send someone out on a tour
in order to do some work for our organization. The answer by Comrade Cannon
was, we don&#8217;t need any advice. In June 1931 I wrote an article, also in
August I sent a discussion article to the Militant, both of which are still
to be published. As a worker and defender of Comrade Trotsky&#8217;s views since
1924, I appeal to the members and sympathizers of the L.O. to call an immediate
conference in order to discuss the international problems which face the
Communist movement, and the future work of the L.O. in this country, and
to elect a committee (Not a la Stalin) but in a real communist way.

<div align=right>Comradely yours,
<br />Denis Plarinos</div>

<center>
<p><br />**************************************</center></p>

<p>Following is part of a letter sent Comrade Plarinos, expressing the
opinion of the Class Struggle on his letter:
<p>Dear Comrade,
<p>We have received both your letter and the article you sent us for the
Class Struggle. We will be glad to print your article. At the same time,
I must tell you there are some things you write which seem to me (and the
other comrades of our editorial board) to be mistaken. I refer to the demand
you raise for a Fourth International. This slogan has not yet been raised
by the Left Opposition anywhere, and for good reasons.
<p>1. It is leaping ahead of events to raise such a slogan now. It is true,
the Stalinist regime has brought the Communist International to very heavy
losses. Errors have been made of a very serious character from the experience
of the Chinese Revolution down to the German situation today. The Communist
International on one important question of program (question of building
Socialism in one country) has departed from the fundamental teachings of
Marx and Lenin.
<p>You conclude from these things, we must have a new International. But
look at the question from another side. Is the&#8212;moment here now for
such a slogan? After all, we don&#8217;t cross the Mississippi River while we
are in Pennsylvania State, we wait till we reach Illinois or Tennessee.
It is too soon now, and we do not see cause yet, to issue a slogan for
a new International.
<p>2. This International, the Third, has not yet betrayed. Here it seems
to me, your opinions are too extreme. The policies of the 3<sup>rd</sup>
International since the death of Lenin are terrible mistakes, but not yet
betrayals. The 2<sup>nd</sup> International betrayed the workers in 1914
when it gave itself over to the support of the national governments in
the world war. As far as that the 3<sup>rd</sup> International has not
yet gone. If in Germany the Communist International would refuse to fight
at the present time, this would again be a betrayal like that of 1914.
But we see now that at last the C.P. of Germany is beginning to take Trotsky&#8217;s
position (let us hope, not too late) and is making a united front with
the Social Democrats to fight the Fascists. That they can still betray
the German workers in some other form, is still possible, but they have
not done so yet.
<p>3. The Communist International still has much larger numbers of workers
following it than the Left Opposition. In only two countries (Greece and
Spain) is the L.O. larger than the official parties. It is not possible,
to organize, while the great majority of Communists still follow the 3<sup>rd</sup>.
We know, that the membership of the Communist parties is a new membership
(this applies to Europe as well as to America). The old membership to a
great extent has dropped out. The new layers of workers, awakened by the
crisis, turn to the C.P. Yet this does not prevent the fact, that the Left
Opposition can win directly only a few workers to itself. Even with correct
tactics (which we have not yet seen in America) it would be very hard for
the L.O. to win workers as the party can do. There is still the prestige
of the Russian Revolution around the C.P.; there is still the material
support of the Russian party behind the Stalinist parties.
<p>4. We claim that we must function as a fraction of the C.I. and strive
to correct the political line of the C.I. To change the leadership of the
Stalinist parties, corrupted as they are, we believe to be impossible.
But there is still hope in the membership. There are still some cadres
--- those who do the mass work in the field, who lead strikes, etc. ---
who are not too much corrupted, and who in time will have to think and
see the futility, the uselessness, of giving their work to support the
Stalin leadership.
<p>5. While we consider ourselves a fraction of the C.I. we at the same
time call for independent mass work by the Left-Opposition, which alone
will enable our forces to grow. This is necessary, because we are not allowed
to work in the party, and also to convince the workers that our policies
are correct. Merely by our talking they will not be convinced, but by action.
<p>6. The Communist International still keeps a communist program (except
on the question of building socialism in one country). It still believes
in the destruction of the capitalist state, and in the dictatorship of
the proletariat. Therefore there is still hope to correct the errors which
are principally errors of tactics.(Of course it will be necessary always
to get rid of the Stalin clique leadership, before any change can be made.)
and to restore the Left Opposition leaders such as Trotsky and his colleagues.
It is true errors of tactics lead to change of program, if the errors are
deep and not corrected. Again, it is here a question of time, it is a question
how deep and how hopeless are the errors of the party.
<p>7. It is possible we will have to change our line, and if the degeneration
of the C.I. goes much further without correction, we will have to call
for a 4<sup>th</sup> International. Let us see what develops in Germany,
for example. The German workers are not such fools. They are hardened,
developed workers who have been through two revolutions. It is possible
that through the struggle in Germany the Left Opposition will become stronger,
and with this prestige will be able to drive out the Stalin clique. It
is also possible, if the workers are defeated in Germany, the masses of
the workers everywhere will awaken to the corruption of the C.I. through
this defeat, and will rally to the L.O. In this case, perhaps a 4<sup>th</sup>
International will be formed but we will cross the river when we reach
it.

<p><br /><b>************************************</b>
<p><b>PARTY MISEDUCATION</b></center></p>

<p>The kind of education meted out to the new recruits of the C.P. is partly
responsible for its 100% turnover in membership. In the latest pamphlet
entitled &#8220;The C.P. in Action&#8221; Comrade Bittelman quotes Stalin to prove
to us what were Lenin&#8217;s ideas. Evidently the party has reached the point
where it finds it dangerous to permit even Lenin to speak for himself.
The purpose is first to foist Stalin on the masses as the greater theoretician
and secondly to permit this infallible genius to twist his understanding
of Lenin in such a way as to cover his own mistakes and thus palm them
off as compatible with Leninism.
<p>For example, on pg. 13 we find the following: &#8220;The organizational principles
of Bolshevism follow inevitably from the Bolshevik conception of the role
of the C.P. What is this conception? Stalin states that in the following
words. &#8220;The Party should be the vanguard of the working class. It should
group within it the best elements, should embody their experiences, their
revolutionary spirit, their unbounded devotion to the cause of the proletariat&#8230;.
The Party is the political leader of the working class".
<p>Is there a single idea in the above that even slightly &#8230;&#8230;.. the
position of Lenin and Trotsky as manifested in their constructive work
in the first three congresses of the C.I.? To inject Stalin as an authority
gives the effect of a superfluous wart on a smooth skin. It is necessary
to quote Lenin on important matters and not what Stalin thinks that Lenin
said. We could forgive this in the absence of Lenin&#8217;s works, but since
they are at our disposal we are somewhat skeptical when Stalin is quoted
instead. It is also to be remarked that every time Bittelman directs his
lying slanders against Trotsky, this is done by a mere statement, unsubstantiated
by facts. Not one quotation to prove that Trotsky really holds the views
charged against him. No doubt Bittelman hopes all errors will be forgiven
him by Stalin in payment of these lies and further honor may be bestowed
upon him for constantly quoting Stalin, ad nauseam.
<p>For example, this: &#8220;&#8230; It can be seen how slanderous are the assertions
of the Trotskyite counter-revolutionists and other renegades that are trying
to prove that Leninism is purely a Russian phenomenon, that the teachings
of Lenin are not applicable to other countries. It was against this smuggling
of Trotskyism into our literature, into the history of the Bolshevik party,
that Comrade Stalin came forth so sharply, like our true Bolshevik leader,
in his now famous letter to the Russian periodical Proletarian Revolution.&#8221; <p>As a theoretician Bittelman takes first prize in invention. No matter
how one may distort, falsify and misquote Trotsky, this charge cannot hold
for at no time has Trotsky or any of his followers even intimated that
Leninism is a purely Russian phenomenon. As to the smuggling of Trotskyism
into the literature, does Bittelman refer to the writings of Trotsky during
1917 to 1923.? If so, we may say these were passed by the censors of the
C.I. with Lenin at the helm. True, Stalin after 1924 found damaging evidence
against himself and it was he who falsified history. It was he who ordered
Trotsky&#8217;s name to be stricken out from certain activities and his own substituted.
This happened only after the death of Lenin.

<p><b>CURRENT COMMENT:
<p>PARTY HOOLIGAN TACTICS</b></center></p>

<p>Some time ago the Daily Worker carried an announcement that the party&#8217;s
election campaign tactics included the &#8220;participation&#8221; of Communists in
all election campaign meetings. We had a misgiving as to the meaning of
this decision. Now it has become plain. In last weeks Militant we read
of the breaking up of a street meeting of the Communist League of America
(Cannon Group) by party members.
<p>These hooligan tactics of the party must be denounced in the strongest
terms. The breaking up by physical violence of meetings of workers&#8217; organizations
is a tactic which illustrates Stalinist rudeness in all its stupidity.
Powerless to convince by argument or by superior achievement, the C.,P.
finds no other resort than to destroy or attempt to destroy, by brute force
all organizations which do not agree with it. The breaking up of a street
meeting of the I.W.W. by the party a year ago did as much as anything else
to make it impossible for the party to win over the honest militant workers
a few of whom are still to be found in the I.W.W.
<p>When the meeting is one of a communist group, the tactic becomes still
more damnable, and when the meeting in question is actually calling upon
workers to support the candidates of the C.P., to break up such a meeting
becomes an act in the highest degree stupid and criminal.
<p>The Communist League of Struggle has so far experienced only heckling
in its meetings this season, which it has been able to handle. However,
we protest just as vehemently against the breaking up of the meeting of
the C.L.A. A letter is being sent to the district office of the party,
voicing our protest.
<center>
<p><b>UNITE FOR SPANISH REVOLUTION</b></center></p>

<p>That the ferocious persecution of the &#8220;democratic&#8221; government of Spain
falls chiefly upon the leaders of the Left Opposition testifies to the
vital activity of this group which has been using the united front tactic
to great advantage in carrying forward the Spanish revolution. The raid
on the offices of El Soviet on May 30<sup>th</sup> resulted in the arrest
of 21 comrades including Andres Nin, These comrades have since been released,
but the persecutions continue.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago the Communist League of Struggle sent a letter to
the New York Branch of the C.L.A. offering to make a united front with
this organization, and proposed a tentative plan of action, to defend the
Spanish comrades who were then in jail. A reply was received acknowledging
receipt of our communication. Since then we have had no further word.</p>

<p>At least this reply constitutes an advance over the previous receptions
given our overtures to the C.L.A. Our last offer of a united front with
them also on the question of the Spanish revolution. The answer then was
the famous editorial in the Militant declaring that what was needed between
the two organizations was not a bridge but a rope. We shall continue to
propose the united front with the C.L.A. on concrete issues, trusting that
in time these comrades will be induced to see that such working together
of the two groups supporting the views of the International Left Opposition
will not only further the attainment of the concrete object in question,
but will do much to bring about a closer political cooperation between
the two groups and hence to strengthen the Left Opposition in America.

<p><b>ONE YEAR IN THE BROOKLYN NAVY YARD</b></center></p>

<p>It is now a year since the Communist League of Struggle, soon after
its establishment as an organized group, began the publication of a Communist
shop paper (the Red Dreadnaught) in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The paper has
continued its regular appearance. At first received with suspicion and
reluctance by some of the workers, its monthly appearance is now eagerly
welcomed by the great majority. It has made contacts in the factory and
has obtained correspondence from the workers there. It has put up demands
for the Yard workers, and has brought to their attention a Communist viewpoint
upon many matters. It has been persistently put forward the necessity for
union organization and has supported the TUUL as the organization to join.
<p>During this time, what has been the history of the Party, YCL and TUUL
in the Yard? A couple of leaflets have reached the workers from the Party
and YCL. The League has conducted some gate meetings. The TUUL (Metal Workers
Industrial League) has so far a record of inefficiency and lack of accomplishment
scarcely to be surpassed. After almost a year (during which there were
several TUUL members working in the Yard) finally the office decides to
organize the place, YCL members are colonized there. Meetings of
the shop group begin to be called. It is decided to put out a paper. The
members of the committee give up their evenings to prepare the paper. Is
it distributed?&#8212;NO! What the C.L.S. with its tiny membership has been
able to do faithfully and regularly for a year the TUUL cannot do.
<p>When the Economy Bill passed Congress, a special leaflet was issued
for the Yard by the TUUL, announcing a noo-day shop gate meeting with Hathaway
as speaker. Was the meeting held?&#8212;NO! Perhaps Hathaway is too great
a man to go out to speak at factory gates. At any rate, no meeting was
held. With such irresponsibility can the TUUL expect to win much following
in the Yard?

<p><b>SUPPORT COAL MINE STRIKES!</b></center></p>

<p>That thousands of coal miners are on strike both in eastern Ohio and
in Illinois is a fact which is too little known to the workers elsewhere.
The capitalist press is silent about both strikes. The Daily Worker gives
news to the Ohio strike, where the National Miners Union has won some influence.
But on the Illinois situation, although it involves 40,000 miners and their
families, the Daily agrees with the policy of the New York Times and keeps
mum. The reason for this is obvious. There is no National Miners Union
in Illinois. The Party&#8217;s sectarian hands-off policy towards the Illinois
miners progressive movements has had the inevitable result that the miners
there must conduct their struggle against the Lewis machine and against
the coal operators without the help of the Stalinist Communists. Their
fight now is against a 36 % wage cut. A certain degree of autonomy has
been won from the Lewis machine, some locals not paying dues to the International
Union. Of course, this is far from being sufficient, and the Illinois miners
must continue their struggle until they achieve a complete separation from
that vulture, the United Mine Workers. At the same time, they must strive
to unite with militant groups elsewhere (National Miners&#8217; Union, West Va.
Miners, etc.) until a sound, fighting, country-wide organization has been
achieved.
<p>In Ohio the battle continues through many weeks, with frequent arrests
and shootings, and with the United Mine Workers playing a strike-breaking
role. Friends of labor everywhere must rally to the support of the coal
miners immediately and with all means in their power. Money and clothes
should be sent to the Workers International Relief&#8212;4 Freiter Bldg.
Bridgeport, Ohio and to Illinois Miners Relief Committee&#8212;610 Illinois
Mine Workers Bldg.&#8212;Springfield Illinois.

<p><b>UNPRINCIPLED RESOLUTION OF THE LANDAU GROUPING</b></center></p>

<p>The latest issue of &#8220;Le Communiste&#8221; organ of the Landau grouping, carries
a rather astonishing resolution. This deals with the relations of the &#8220;International
Communist Left&#8221; (Landau group) and the C.I. This group declares its intentions
of functioning as a fraction of the C.I. and at the same time of conducting
independent activity. So far, so good. What is astounding, what arouses
indignation, in this resolution is that it makes no mention whatever, not
even by a single word, of the present attitude of this group towards the
International Left Opposition of which the group has until recently been
a part. It is true, this is a resolution on &#8220;relations with the C.I.&#8221; Whether
the question is dealt with outside of this bulletin, we do not know. But
this does not alter the fact that to ignore completely the Left Opposition
seems to us an entirely unprincipled step which can only create confusion
and must certainly alienate any confidence whatsoever in this grouping.

<p>***************************************</p>
<p><b>ANOTHER CONVENTION</b></center></p>

<p>The third convention of the National Textile Workers Union passed in
ghost-like silence like a ship in the fog. Even the Daily Worker could
not work up a splurge about it. On July 8<sup>th</sup> we find an editorial,
of course, the usual sack-clothe and ashes. The convention was held in
Boston, which is not a textile center. Were there any textile workers there?
From the condition of the union we can be sure, not many. In Passaic, formerly
the guiding star of the movement throughout the country, the union does
not exist. In Patterson, scene of many old and of recent battles it has
the merest handful of members. In the Southern States it does not exist.
In Philadelphia it never had a footing. Of New Bedford, Lawrence and other
New England centers, of the tri-cities (Easton Allentown and Bethlehem),
and the Anthracite, we do not have first-hand information, but from the
lack of activity and the lack of textile news in the Daily, we can be sure
the union is at a very low ebb in these centers.
<p>Of course the editorial in the Daily Worker admitted the complete bankruptcy
of the union. But the C.P. leadership cannot account for the cause of the
failure. The errors admitted to: tendency to jump from place to place instead
of carrying on a sustained activity, constant changes of leadership, &#8220;weakness
in the application of trade union democracy&#8221;, weakness in the struggle
against the United Textile Workers (AFL) leadership, failure of the party
to lead, failure to penetrate the mills and carry on the day-by-day struggle,
--- these things summarize the failure of the party in all fields of work.
<p>To understand the collapse of the NTWU we must look back to the two
previous conventions. In September 1928 the first national convention was
held launching the new union. An abrupt turn was then taking place in the
party&#8217;s trade-union policies, following the leftist turn in the C.I. so
that the new unions were started suddenly, in some cases where sufficient
ground did not exist (food workers) in others without sufficient preparation.
In the textile field there was certainly a basis for the revolutionary
union. The AFL union (United Textile Workers) covered only a few small
centers with organizations of the skilled. To the masses of the unorganized
it was known as a betrayer of strikes and a reactionary organization in
spite of the short time for preparation for the first convention, the new
union was launched successfully on the wave of enthusiasm of the New Bedford
strike, with a not too poor representation from Passaic, Paterson, the
tri-cities, Lawrence, the Anthracite, etc. The convention made a thorough
analysis of the industry and laid plans for building a real organization.
<p>The first year of the union showed steady progress. The prestige of
the Passaic and New Bedford strikes was still fresh. The national office
functioned efficiently. An organizer was sent to North Carolina, opening
up the South for the first time to the Communists. Organizers functioned
in New Bedford, Lawrence, Paterson-Passaic, tri-cities, Anthracite and
Philadelphia. The membership steadily grew. Mill locals were beginning
to be formed. Early in 1929 the Gastonia strike brought to the fore all
the latent capacities of the revolutionary unions for leading in struggle
new strata of the American working class.
<p>In December 1929 was held the second convention of the NTWU. This convention
marked a turning point after which the collapse of the union was very soon
accomplished. During 1929 took place the splits in the American party with
the driving out of thousands of worthwhile members, not only from the party
but from their posts in the mass organizations. Albert Weisbord, National
Secretary of the union, was driven out, Vera Buch was driven out. The old
Passaic-New Bedford leadership (Keller, Dawson, Rubenstein, etc.) was driven
out. In the convention of 1929, under the expert guidance of Bill Dunne,
a most shameless frame-up was put over to the effect that Comrade Weisbord
had deserted his post in the South (Weisbord being barred from the hall
meanwhile by Party orders). The union deprived of its known, trusted leaders,
used as the play-ball of the C.P. politicians, quickly melted away. The
disastrous policies in the field completed the job. The South was abandoned.
The Paterson &#8220;general strike&#8221; of 1930, so widely heralded was dropped.
The strike of 1931 in Paterson was called on a most adventurous basis,
with no preparation, with no mill locals, with nondescript leadership which
did not have the workers&#8217; confidence. The dirty treatment by the party
members imported from New York given the members of the Communist League
of Struggle who were active on the picket line did not help the strike
any. The unrealistic united front tactics, (the famous &#8220;united front from
below") which practically abandoned thousands of workers to the Muste-Lovestone
alliance, weakened and isolated the NTWU forces. The Lawrence strike of
1931 was such a brilliant success for the NTWU that the workers, ignoring
the UTW which was also in the field, organized a new group, the American
Textile Workers Union, under the influence of the Muste group.
<p>The awful conditions under which the textile workers now suffer find
them still without an effective organization. The NTWU under the direction
of the C.P. has been saddled with a tremendous load of failures, abandonments,
and mistakes. The Daily Worker editorial admits very significantly that
the workers lack confidence in the NTWU as their daily leader. Yet there
is no hope from other sources for the textile workers. The treachery of
the UTW has been proven long ago. The Muste leadership (with the able cooperation
of the Lovestone members) can only drag the movement into opportunist channels.
It remains for the few party members who are active in the textile field
to throw off the throttling clutch of the old men of the sea&#8212;the Fosters,
Browders Minors and Amters&#8212;and to insist that in spite of the terrible
handicaps of the past two and a half years the NTWU make a new start as
the real, militant, responsible leader of the textile workers.

<p><b>IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT</b></center></p>

<p>Some time ago the Communist League of Struggle sent its Secretary, Albert
Weisbord, to Prinkipo, Turkey, to visit Comrade Trotsky and to exchange
views on the questions that separated us from the International Left Opposition.
Comrade Trotsky received our representative in a most friendly and hospitable
manner and made him his guest for three weeks.
<p>As a result of the discussions, we are in receipt of several extremely
important documents in which Comrade Trotsky criticized our group. These
documents are not only important to our group, but, we believe, are historic
documents of high value to the whole Communist movement.
<p>An early issue of our paper will be entirely devoted to these documents
and to the views of our group upon the matters raised by Comrade Trotsky.
