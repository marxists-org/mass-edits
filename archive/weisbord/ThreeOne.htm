<p><b>1933 --Year of Decisive Conflict.</b></center></p>

<p>All the signs point to the year of 1933 as one of decisive conflicts.
Certainly our prognosis of the year 1932 as a year of head-on collisions,
(an estimate which we made at a time when the other Communist groups were
talking of &#8220;America reaching new peaks&#8221; and that the crisis would be over
by 1933) has been amply verified. In South America, in China, in Spain,
in Germany, to mention but a few key places, the contradictions of capitalism
led to open head-on collisions.
<p>1933 can witness only a deepening of the conflicts. The unstable equilibrium
must lead to a decision-to a crash.
<p>1. Japan must go through with her adventure or collapse. But to go through
with the seizure of Manchuria and the partition of China must terminate
only in a titanic Asiatic convulsion if not world war.
<p>2. The Spanish Revolution cannot continue indefinitely in its &#8220;Kerensky&#8221; period. The long drawn out instability that exists must end with either
a victory for reaction or a Soviet Republic.
<p>3. In Germany the crash of forces cannot be suspended indefinitely.
Either reaction will win and the Communists are crushed not only in Germany
but in all central Europe or a civil war leading to world war and revolution
must eventuate from the situation. In either case the whole fate of the
world revolution and of the Soviet Union is involved.
<p>4. The enormous pressure of the crisis must result in a decision between
debtor Europe and creditor America. It must also result in a decision in
the struggle between the United States and the British Empire for world
power. Finally it must move to a definite solution of the gigantic conflict
between Communism and capitalism.
<p>1933 sees America on a historic turning point of her career, the Europeanization
of America that will bring the last portion of the capitalist globe into
the decadence of a putrid imperialist era whose carcass already has long
been fit for interment. The Europeanization of America, the formation of
class forces consciously facing each other gives gigantic opportunities
to the Communists and paints in glowing colors the future of the Left Opposition
in the United States, and makes all the more necessary the growth of the
Communist League of Struggle.

<p><b>The Washington Hunger March of 1932</b></center></p>

<p>The New York City contingent of delegates to the Washington Hunger March
reported at the Prospect Workers Club, 1157 Southern Boulevard, in the
Bronx on Tuesday, November 29th, at 5 P.M. after being ratified at Irving
Plaza the previous Sunday. This delegation consisted of 315 delegates elected
from Unemployed Councils, Trade Unions, Block Committees, Workers Clubs,
Flop Houses, Waterfront Marine Workers, etc. In the delegation there were
50 women, 31 negroes, and 14 Filipinos. After being identified we, after
waiting for about four hours (during which time we were served with boloney
sandwiches and water), were assigned to our trucks and Squads. I was assigned
to Truck C, Squad I. Every truck captain and assistant truck captain were
members of the Communist Party. After being assigned we lined up in the
street where the Police, plain-clothesmen, reporters and photographers
had in the meantime gathered. During the hour or so that we were lined
up we were joined by the Upstate New York and New England delegates.
<p>We then proceeded to march to the Bronx Coliseum where we received a
wonderful ovation. Very inspiring indeed was the march around the great
forces of the masses. I experienced the most wonderful sensation. The whole
capitalist theory of individualism appears ridiculous. One feels how small
he is. Such was my feelings at the time. After marching around the hall
twice the marchers were seated in the rear and such prominent party members
as Carl Winter, Sam Wiseman, Ann Burlack, head of the New England delegation
addressed the audience. A collection was taken up and a small fortune was
donated to the National Hunger March. The Red Front Band which was hired
to accompany us to Washington played the Internationale, we sang and the
meeting was adjourned.
<p>When we arrived outside, the trucks were waiting for us and we all jumped
in being in good spirits and humor. We then proceeded to the Municipal
Lodging House where we were supposed to be put up for the night and be
given breakfast in the morning before going on our journey. Arriving at
the Municipal Lodging House, the trucks were stopped and a committee went
inside where they were informed that each marcher would have to line up
as an individual, fill out an application giving his life&#8217;s history, have
his clothes fumigated and take a bath before he would be permitted to go
to bed. This meant that it would be about five o&#8217;clock in the morning before
we could all be registered since it was already about 12:30 A.M. This offer
was rejected and the trucks then brought us to the Manhattan Lyceum after
last minute arrangements by the committee. So the first night we spent
at the Manhattan Lyceum, most of us without blankets. We tried to snatch
a couple of hours sleep before dawn, but it was cold and I, after lying
on the floor for a few minutes, got up again and did not sleep a wink that
night.
<p>In the morning we were quite worn after a sleepless night in a cold
hall, but no one complained. We were an army of disciplined workers on
a hunger march, not a picnic. Such was the philosophy of the really wonderful
proletarian workers. After breakfast which we had in two shifts at the
Garden Restaurant on 13th Street, we marched to Union Square where after
a slight demonstration and delay we got in our trucks and left New York.
<p>The next day the &#8220;New York Daily News&#8221; had a picture of beautiful white
beds in the Municipal Lodging House. The caption under the picture read
--- &#8220;These are the clean beds the Hunger Marchers refused to sleep in last
night. Too much red tape they said. Preferring to stay at the Manhattan
Lyceum instead.&#8221; Such was the treatment we received by the capitalist press
all through the march. The &#8220;World Telegram&#8221; reported that we received $2.00
a day for marching: a most vicious deliberate lie. The &#8220;New York Times&#8221; put Hunger Marchers in quotations denying that there was Hunger. In Russia
in 1901 there was a great famine. Thousands were dying; yet the newspapers
under the Czar printed not a word of it. No one was permitted to give aid
to the starving masses. To do so would be to recognize hunger. There is
no hunger. So it was with us according to the Times. The marchers were
neither hungry nor were they marchers&#8212;they rode in trucks.
<p>After leaving New York via the Holland Tunnel, we held a meeting from
the back of our trucks in Newark where we also made a good collection,
distributed our propaganda, sold pamphlets and then proceeded through such
towns and cities as Elizabeth and New Brunswick where we were cheered on
by the workers of their respective cities. Slogans were shouted from the
trucks and we arrived in Trenton where we were to spend the night after
a supper which was prepared by the Trenton Comrades with the aid of the
W.I.R.
<p>The next morning after breakfast and a meeting in Trenton, we continued
on our trip. Our next over night stop being the City of Philadelphia. In
Philadelphia we left our trucks in Rayburn Plaza and marched to City Hall
where a huge demonstration took place after the city council of that city
had refused us shelter for the night. After the demonstration we lined
up in fours. The Red Front Bank took its place at the head and we marched
from City Hall to Girard Manor without a permit tying up traffic in some
of the most congested streets of Philedelphia. At Girard Manor we were
served with a good warm meal. The delegation in the meantime had greatly
increased in numbers since each city we went through we were joined by
more delegates. After a meeting at Girard Manor the women comrades went
to spend the night at a hall a small distance away. The men were taken
by their trucks to the Italian Workers Progressive Club to sleep. We were
all quite tired even though the night before in Trenton we had about five
or six hours sleep on chairs which we had put together and covered ourselves
with blankets which by that time were supplied. In Philadelphia there were
no chairs so we spread our blankets on the floor which was very crowded
and so we slept.
<p>In the morning, after waiting some time, the trucks brought us back
to Girard Manor where we had breakfast followed by a street meeting from
the back of the trucks. I was asked to speak and did so. I spoke on the
fourth year of the crisis, the misery of the of the masses and the great
lockout of the workers separated from all means of relief. After my speech
I was congratulated by a few party members who shook my hand and told me
I had done very well. They did not know the program I had spoken on was
not the program of their party but that of the Left Opposition as presented
by the Communist League of Struggle.
<p>So we left Philadelphia, our next destination being Wilmington, Delaware.
Let us stop here and consider the situation in Wilmington. Wilmington is
a stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan controlled by the great magnate no other
than Du Pont who among other things is a great manufacturer of munitions.
After giving us a permit to march, the police officials revoked it and
told us we would not march in Wilmington. After we left Chester, Pennsylvania
where we also marched and had a demonstration in front of their City Hall.
We were insructed to save the bottles of soda pop which had been put in
each truck for water. We were told that we might expect trouble in Wilmington
and that we intended to march through there. The trucks reached Wilmington.
The marchers had left their trucks in about three minutes after the order
was issued and were already to march. I had a banner in my hands besides
the bottle which I had in my back pocket and were all ready for action.
The police Commissioner who was there and his armed force were taken by
surprise. They had expected a bunch of straggling beggars. Instead they
found a great army of disciplined workers. Everything happened so fast
the police were really taken unaware. We had emptied our trucks, lined
up in fours and started marching before the police really knew what was
happening.
<p>But Comrades, the feelings, the prestige of the hired thugs who hide
behind a blue coat, brass buttons and a shield was not to be trampled upon
in this manner as we shall soon see.
<p>We marched through Wilmington cheering, shouting, jeering the police.
We used such slogans as &#8220;Negro and White Unite and Fight Against Starvation&#8221; and others since the negro population of Wilmington is quite large. We
marched down to what appeared to be the lower part of the city. Here in
a warehouse, mill or stable (whatever you prefer to call it) the largest
part of the contingent was put up. This place was absolutely without windows
on the lower floor. There was no ventilation. It was here that we ate standing
up. We had something which we ate from containers on long tables and each
one had a large piece of bread. The women comrades, a few men and the New
England contingent we put up in a Polish Church about two short blocks
from the warehouse. This church was rented for $10.00 the night. (The damage
to the Church amounts to about $500 or $600). In the meantime, I had finished
my meal and we were all locked up in the warehouse. The air was terrible,
the cement floor was dirty. The place where we were to spend the night
was this same warehouse. I was let out of the warehouse when I told the
comrades at the door I wanted to get my blanket from the truck and once
out in the open, two other comrades and myself decided to walk around a
bit. After walking a few blocks we turned in the direction of the Church
and found that the comrades had tried to hold a meeting on the corner but
the police had broken it up. So they were holding a meeting from the steps
of the Church. A woman comrade was speaking. A cop went up the steps to
stop her but the strong hands of other workers pushed him down again. Immediately
the police began scattering the workers who were listening. A large number
of them mounted the steps after another speaker had started to address
the crowd. They came up like real terrorists swinging their clubs right
and left upon the heads of the workers. In the meantime the comrades in
the rear had backed up into the Church. The doors were closed and barricaded.
The police then went around the side. There was a great smashing of windows;
tear gas was thrown into the Church. The cops finally broke in but they
were met by a bombardment of chairs. The workers put up a great battle.
One of the Wilmington papers the next morning reported that the women fought
like tigers. The cops came in with drawn guns, searched the comrades and
were very abusive to the women and arrested twenty-three but not before
four cops were sent to the hospital. Three workers were injured seriously
enough to need hospital care also. By this time, I had returned back to
the warehouse where the report was spread as to what had happened at the
Church. They had heard the police sirens and knew something had happened.
As soon as the report was spread around, everyone, even those who had already
laid down on the dirty cement floor to sleep, became alert. Every table
was broken up. Everyone had sticks. The situation was indeed critical.
We were ready to fight, everyone of us. But no orders were issued and so
we waited for about an hour after which Carl Winter came in and reported
to us what had happened. A committee had come back from the police station
after going there to find out what they had done to those arrested. The
police refused information and arrested one of the committe for being too
out-spoken. So the situation was as follows: We could expect one of three
things. First, that the police would back up the trucks and escort us out
of town immediately. Second, that they would do the same thing here as
in the Church which of course would be much worse since the warehouse was
more congested and the air was wasted. And third, we would be permitted
to stay until morning. That night was a very tense night for all of us.
Very few slept. We expected to be attacked any minute but the night wore
on and nothing happened.
<p>The next morning the doors were opened. We were packed into any truck
and our moods were different then when we had marched into Wilmington.
Very few sang. We were interested only in getting out of Wilmington and
continuing our journey. A committee was left behind to take care of those
who were arrested and ill. The I.S.D was notified and we were assured that
the comrades would be taken care of.
<p>Our next overnight stop was Baltimore where we had no trouble at all.
We marched , most of us were put up at the Armory and fed by the Salvation
Army. The rest of us were taken to the Finnish Workers Club where we were
well taken care of as far as the food was concerned and went to sleep on
the floor of the same hall or on our trucks.
<p>We then proceeded the following morning to our alternative, the Capital
of the United States, Washington D.C. We arrived within the city limits
of Washington but here the police were prepared for us. All the trucks
were stopped on New York Avenue by lines and lines of police. We got out
of our trucks. It was about three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon of Sunday December
4th and as the afternoon wore on it became clear that the police had the
upper hand. Trucks from all parts of the country joined us in our encampment;
up to midnight trucks came from the West from Minnesota, Seattle, San Diego,
etc. This was the first time delegates had come from the extreme parts
of the country. The 3,000 delegates were all virtually imprisoned. Police
in front of us, police on the embankment openly displaying their machine
guns, tear gas, guns and clubs on all sides. This was the situation. We
were all bottled up. The owner of the Washington Auditorium had received
instructions from the Federal authorities not to rent us his hall and he
told the committee if they would withdraw the telegram he would rent it
to us. But they certainly would not.
<p>So there we were surrounded by the armed forces of Washington exposed
to the cold, no water, no toilets. The government did not have to shoot
us. They used nature against us.
<p>In Washington the Party bureacrats suddenly pop up. Herbert Benjamin
by aeroplane-Isreal Amter, James Ford, Reynolds, all looking very immaculate,
well-fed and perfectly happy. Where had these men been when we slept on
the floors; when we faced the police they were not there, but suddenly
they come out of nowhere and proclaim themselves leaders. After taking
the vanguard and exposing them to all the elements which resulted in the
death of two delegates, 15 cases of pneumonia, 20 cases of influenza, sore
throats, fevers and colds, these so-called leaders by what right are they
the leaders of the masses? Who are they to take the lives of workers in
their hands? Have they ever been in struggle themselves?
<p>At any rate, the officials decided to let us march through Washington
providing we get out immediatly after. We marched through Washington and
the reception we received there was very cold. The Federal Employees of
the government would not cheer hunger marchers. Two committees went up
to see Speaker Garner and Vice-President Curtis besides the marine workers
who presented their demands seperately to the Shipping Board. They were
all treated roughly by the police who gave their petitions to Garner who
said he would consider it. Curtis grew red in the face when he was &#8220;insulted&#8221; by one of the delegates.
<p>For the hunger march Washington had the greatest police mobilization
in its history. Every fireman was deputized and given a gun and a club.
The cops outnumbered the marchers easily.
<p>After the march, we came back to our encampment and I took some addresses
of some comrades whom I had spoken to. Many of the workers were actually
crying for a program like that of the C.L.S. The conclusion I could get
from my conversation with them was &#8220;what next?&#8221; <p>We left Washington and arrived in Baltimore that same night. I had left
the main hall after eating and escorting a comrade to another building
where she had a place to sleep. After leaving her I was way-laid by two
Y.C.L. members who started to question me first about a Comrade Meller
who had been kicked off his truck as a disruptive element because he was
a friend of William Kitt, a member of the same union (Alteration Painters
Union) who was a Trotskite. They asked me how many times he had spoken
to me, what he had said and then asked me if&nbsp; I had taken addresses.
I said I had and what of it. They then said there were spies in camp and
compared me with them and asked to see the addresses. After some discussion,
I finally showed these corrupted elements of the Y.C.L., the book with
the addresses. These addresses were immediately torn out. I was told to
shut up or else--. I was threatened and told if I wanted to stay on the
truck to keep quiet. The names of these two are Axelrod and Nat Le Roy
who was expelled from the Williamsburg Unit about 2 years ago for irresponsibility,
refusal to do work and leaving town without permission.
<p>The next day I brought it up in the truck and Pauline Rogers, well-to-do
woman with an estate in Connecticut who was captain of my truck said, &#8220;Well
perhaps they were a bit impolite, but they were over enthusiastic and were
not so wrong in taking action in their own hands.&#8221; The girl from my union
testified that she had been told to watch me very closely on the march
and that I had been taking addresses and carrying on the same policy in
my union. One of the members of the party made a motion that my certificate
making me an organizer of the unemployed be taken away. But Rogers said
it had to be taken up with the National Committee. This was not done and
the whole thing was left up in the air.
<p>In conclusion, I can only say the Hunger March which merely dramatized
the damands of the workers only proves the futility of such marches so
far as really doing effective work is concerned. Already the party is speaking
of another hunger march. The Communist Party in the fourth year of the
crisis has shown that in its present stage it is not capable of leading
the masses. We can only hope that the Program of the Left Opposition will
reach the workers. Only then can we build up a Revolutionary movement that
truly represents communism and the great masses of America.
<p>To the above clear report on the Washington Hunger March we wish to
make the following notes:
<p>1. The unspeakable brazenness of the governmental forces. The denial
even of &#8220;Hunger". The mocking refusal of the slightest concession to social
insurance. The brutality against the marchers. The fear of the working
class manifested in Washington.
<p>2. The complete collapse of all radical groups on the question of unemployment
except the Communist Party. Only the Communist Party makes an attempt at
doing anything.
<p>3. The futility of the work of the Communist Party. Everything is done
wrong. The first stage of its work was &#8220;Are you hungry? then come to the
mass meeting at Union Square". The second stage was &#8220;The Bill, the Bill,
Vote for the Bill, a million signatures for the Communist Bill for Social
Insurance". The third stage has been &#8220;On to City Hall, County Seat, State
House, Washington &#8220;&#8212;Hunger Marches. In each case the Communist Party
substituted showy cheap dramatic gestures for serious work. First, the
Communist Party recruted its forces from the slop houses. Then it went
to &#8220;expose&#8221; private charities. Finally it is at the stage of &#8220;exposing
Tammany Hall and the government". In each case it has forgotten the proletarian
neighborhood. Its unemployed councils are miserable fiascos. Like the yellow
socialists in each case they avoid direct action.
<p>4. The barrenness of the theory of Social Fascism, and the denial of
the tactic of the united front. The hand of Stalinism isolates the Communists.
In the conference called for the Hunger March even a workers club which
meets at our headquarters was denied participation because of that fact.
<p>5.The Communist bureaucracy in full bloom. No discussions as to policy.
No election of leaders. Appointments of everyone by the Communist Party.
The marchers are mere mannikins. Railroaded elections of the &#8220;new&#8221; national
"leaders". Such &#8220;hunger&#8221; marchers as Pauline Rogers lead the way. The chief
of the Hunger March reaches the scene-by airplane from New York&#8212;just
in time.
<p>6.The useless wearing out of the marchers. 10% arrested, 10% sent to
the hospitals because of bad managment of the marchers, 2 dead from exposure.
This is the casualty list. Note, from the report, not even in New York
were the New Yorkers allowed to sleep. The handling of the march was such
as to isolate the vanguard from the proletariat and permit the police and
press to ridicule it, to isolate it, and to club it to pieces.
<p>7. The vicious attack on the representative of the Communist League
of Struggle. &#8220;All Trotskyites are stool pigeons". This is the answer of
the witness Communist Party misleaders to the program that the Communist
League of Struggle presented.
<center>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center></p>

<p>We give the program of the Communist League of Struggle that was issued
to the Hunger Marchers to Washington. The Communist League of Struggle
alone raises the slogan &#8220;END THE LOCKOUT&#8221; and alone raises the tactic of
GENERAL STRIKE the call for which is to be issued by a united front conference
the basic part of which must be the trade unions.
<p>The leaflet follows:
<p>TO THE HUNGER MARCHERS TO WASHINGTON
<p>Comrades:
<p>Hunger marches have taken place before; Marches to city halls, Marches
to County Halls, Marches to state houses, and Marches to Washington. THIS
MARCH MUST HAVE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CHARACTER IF IT IS TO SUCCEED IN
ANY DEGREE. Up to now the marches have been to &#8220;dramatize&#8221; the demands
of the unemployed or to &#8220;expose&#8221; the government as an enemy of the working
class generally and of the unemployed workers in particular.
<p>The present March cannot be merely a &#8220;dramatic stunt&#8221; for newspaper
publicity. Such a march in 1932 can only be a comedy. The present March
cannot be merely an &#8220;exposure&#8221; of the government. To a considerable extent
this had been done already. THE PRESENT MARCH CAN BE SUCCESSFUL ONLY IF
IT IS A THREAT SUPPORTED BY THE POWER OF THE WORKERS BACK HOME.
<p>Only when the Hunger March shows its teeth and acts as a threat to the
government will it truly represent the needs and aspirations of the hungry
and needy masses of the toilers in this country. The Hunger March must
not end up as a &#8220;plea&#8221; for help. THE HUNGER MARCH MUST BE A WARNING TO
THE GOVERNMENT THAT IF THERE IS NO SOCIAL INSURANCE, IF THERE IS NO ADEQUATE
RELIEF BY A GIVEN TIME THE WORKERS WILL BE DRIVEN TO HELP THEMSELVES TO
WHATEVER THEY NEED TO LIVE.
<p>Behind the marchers a power must be organized that will make Congress
listen. The Hunger March must be a clarion call for all the workers to
support the march by demonstations in the workers quarters&#8212;all the
cities of the United States. With fists upraised, every Hunger Marcher
must take an open public pledge in Washington that he will return to his
home city to mobilize all the workers of his neighborhood in huge demonstrations
that will see to it that the workers get the means to live.
<p>The Hunger March demands must be two:
<p>1.A demand on the United States Government for immediate relief and
for social insurance. A GIVEN DATE SHOULD BE SET FOR CONGRESSIONAL ACTION.
<p>2.A demand for the nationalization of the key industries, for the opening
of the factories under workers control so that the necessary products can
be turned over to the unemployed and starving masses.
<p>We strongly urge the following tactics:
<p>1. A great demonstration in Washington threatening drastic action by
the masses should the demands be turned down. The actions threatened should
be of two kinds:
<blockquote>A. National simultaneous street demonstations in all the cities
throughout the country on the date given by the Hunger March for Congress
to act for food, clothing, shelter.
<p>B. A call for a NATIONAL GENERAL STRIKE TO TAKE PLACE ON THE DATE SET
FOR CONGRESS TO ACT, TO PUT PRESSURE ON CONGRESS AND TO SUPPORT THE HUNGER
MARCH should be issued by the Hunger Marchers in Washington.</blockquote>
2. At the Washington demonstration an open call must be issued for the
organization of huge united front conferences in every city of all workers
organizations to carry out these tasks. A special open call should be made
to the trade unions of the American Federation of Labor to join these united
front conferences.

<p><b>The Passage of Trotsky to Anvers&#8212;Open Letter to Vandervelde</b></center></p>

<p>Citizen Vandervelde:
<p>Several years ago you addressed to me an open letter concerning, if
I am not mistaken, the repression against the Mensheviks and Socialist
Revolutionaries. Generally and invariably you have lined yourself up against
the Bolsheviks, in the name of democracy. It is your right. If your criticism
did not achieve the aim followed, it is because we, Bolsheviks, proceed
from the principles of the proletarian dictatorship.
<p>The Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries, your co-religionists in democracy,
opened against us, at the time, a terrorist struggle. They wounded Lenin
and tried to cause the derailment of my military train. Brought before
the Soviet Tribunal they found in you one of their most enraged defenders.
The government to which I belonged authorized you, not only to come to
Soviet Russia but to set yourself up before the Tribunal as the lawyer
of those who had tried to kill the head of the first workers State. In
your pleading which we reproduced in our press, you appealed invariably
to the principles of democracy. It was your right.
<p>On December 4, 1932, I found myself with my companions, enroute to the
port of Anvers. I was proposing neither to propagate the dictatorship of
the propletariat nor to set myself up as defender of the Communists and
of the strikers arrested by the Belgian government, who as much as I know,
had not committed any attempt against the members of the government of
Brussels. Some of my companions, and my wife with them, wished to visit
Anvers. One of them needed, for his trip, to see the consulate of the city.
They categorically to all to touch the soil of Belgium even under guard.
The part of the port where our boat was, was carefully encircled. On one
side and on the other of the boat were horse sentries of the police. From
the bridge, we could pass in review the policement of the democracy, military
as well as civil. It was an imposing spectacle. The number of cops and
dicks&#8212;you will permit this familiar designation for conciseness&#8212;exceeded
the number of sailors and dockmen. The boat resembled a provisional prison.
The part nearest the port to the court of the prison. The chief of police
took copies of our papers although we were not going to Belgium and we
had not been authorized to put up at Anvers. He demanded an explanation
why my passport is in the name of Sedoff. I refused all discussion with
the Belgian police with whom I have nothing to do.
<p>The police officer tried to act threateningly. He declared he had the
right to arrest all those whom the chance of a boat journey led into the
Belgian waters. I must, besides, recognize that there was no arrest.
<p>I ask you not to find in my words any complaint. It would be ridiculous
to complain for such a bagatelle in the face of all that the working masses
and in particular the Communists are forced actually to submit throughout
the world. But the episode at Anvers seems to me a sufficient excuse to
return to your open letter to which I had not responded at the time.
<p>I hope I am not mistaken in putting Belgium in the number of democracies.
The war that you led was&#8212;is it not so?&#8212;the war for democracy. After
the war you were at the head of Belgium as minister and even as premier.
What is more necessary to lead democracy to its full effloresense? Upon
that, I believe, there is no discussion between us. Why then, nevertheless,
can this democracy have so much of the police spirit of old Prussia? And
can one believe that the democracy which experiences such a nervous shock
at the occasional approach of a Bolshevik show itself capable to neutralize
the class struggle and to assure the peaceful transformation of capitalism
to socialism?
<p>In reply you will recall to me no doubt the Tcheka, the G.P.U., the
deportation of Rakovsky and my own expulsion from the Soviet Union. This
argument is false. The Soviet regime does not adorn itself with the peacock
feathers of democracy. If the passage to socialism was possible in the
state forms created by liberalism the revolutionary dictatorship would
not be necessary. For the Soviet regime one can and one should pose the
question to know whether he is capable of teaching the workers the struggle
against capitalism. But it is absurd to demand that the proletarian dictatorship
observe the forms and the rites of liberal democracy. The dictatorship
has its quite severe methods and its logic. The blows of this logic often
enough reach the proletarian revolutionists who participated in the foundation
of the regime of dictatorship. Yes, in the development of an isolated workers
state, betrayed by the international Social-Democracy, the bureaucratic
apparatus has acquired a power dangerous for the Socialist revolution.
No one need remind this to me. But in face of the class enemy I take full
responsibility not only for the revolution of October which engendered
the dictatorship but also for the Soviet Republic, such as it is today,
with its government which has exiled me abroad and deprived me of my rights
of Soviet citizenship.
<p>We have destroyed democracy in order to master capitalism. You defend
capitalism so-called in the name of democracy. But where does this democracy
hang out?
<p>Not in the port of Anvers in any case. There were cops and dicks and
gendarmes armed with rifles. But one could not find the shadow of the right
of democratic asylum.
<p>In spite of all I left the waters of Anvers without the least pessimism.
During the noon-day pause, there gathered on the bridge some dockmen who
had come out of the holds and to the port. There were 20 or 30 of these
strong and calm Flemish proletatians, blackened, for the most part, with
coal dust. A cordon of police separated them from us. The dockers contemplated
in silence the picture in gauging with their looks each one present. There
is one solid docker in a cap who winks in the direction of the police.
Our bridge responds by smiles. A movement stirs the workers. They have
recognized their own, as the Russians say. I am far from saying that the
dockers of Anvers are Bolsheviks. But by a direct instinct they are placed
to us. In returning to work they smiled in a friendly fashion and many
of them put their fingers to their caps as a sign of salute. There is our
democracy, to us.
<p>When the boat descended the Escaut, in the hazy twilight, the length
of the quais, with their cranes paralyzed by the crisis, resounded from
the port with the farewell cries of our unknown but faithful friends.
<p>In closing these lines between Anvers and Vlissingen I send to the workers
of Belgium a fraternal greeting.
<p>December 5, 1932.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><b>The Spanish Revolution at the Crossroads&#8212;Albert Weisbord</b>
<br />(conclusion)</center></p>

<p>As in the Russian Revolution, the Spanish Revolution has witnessed a
great flowering out of all parties and groups. Large finance capital and
secret adherents of the Royalty are represented by the newspaper &#8220;A.B.C.&#8221;,
while the large agrarians have their reactionary paper &#8220;Debate&#8221; and their
group headed by Zamora. These groups occupy the extreme Right Wing. Next
to them are the out-and-out bourgeois parties. The Radicals have the old
fox Lerroux as their spokesman who was the &#8220;Legal Left&#8221; under the king
but who is now far to the Right. In Catalonia, La Liga Regionalista occupies
the Right Bourgeois position. This league has a non-separatist position
and have Cambo, who was Minister of Law under Alphonso, as their leader.
Since the Revolution, the group &#8220;Accio Catalana&#8221; bourgeois, but advocate
of Catalonian Separatism has been organized. Its organ is the paper &#8220;La
Publicitat".
<p>To the left of the bourgeois groups are the petty-bourgeois groups now
flourishing since Alphonso&#8217;s exile. There is the &#8220;Partido Radical-Socialista&#8221; whose chief is Domingo and in Catalonia the group of Macia which takes
a separatist position and whose organ is &#8220;L&#8217; Opinio". Today it is the Radicals
and Radical-Socialists supported by the Socialists who dominate the government.
<p>We turn now to the Labor movement.There are two trade union centers
in Spain: 1. The Union General de Trabajo (U.G.T.) and the Confederacion
National de Trabajo (C.N.T.). The Union General de Trabajo (U.G.T.) has
already a half century of history behind it, having been organized in 1888
and having been the only organization of labor tolerated and permitted
by Alphonso and actually participating in the government under the King.
It is controlled by the reformist Socialist Party and today has about 250,000
to 300,000 members. Large Caballero, up to recently its head, is also now
the Minister of Labor of the Spanish Republic. It is particularly strong
in Madrid, in Biscay (in the metal and mining industry) and in the Asturias
(coal mining) although it is extremely weak in Catalonia, which after all,
is the labor and revolutionary center of the country. Besides its labor
members of the U.G.T. has a considerable peasant affiliation.
<p>The second labor center is the C.N.T. This organization, controlled
by Anarcho-Syndicalists and overwhelmingly strong in Catalonia (Barcelona
especially) whose metal, textile and general proletariat comprise the vanguard
of Spanish labor, is an extremely important revolutionary instrument. It
was organized in 1911 and during the revolutionary wave of 1919 under the
secretaryship of Andres Nin (now Trotskyist) the C.N.T. reached the enormous
membership of almost 1,000,000 members. It was due to this threat of the
proletariat that Alphonso XIII established the military dictatorship of
Primo de Rivera under whose ruthless blows in 1923 the unions were smashed.
The dictatorship of Primo de Rivera saw the virtual annihilation of the
C.N.T.
<p>With the new revolutionary wave that arose in 1929-1930 and that resulted
in Rivera&#8217;s downfall the C.N.T. rapidly reorganized itself and soon regained
its strength of a million members. As we have seen it has launched time
and again extremely powerful and violent general strikes throughout the
country, many of them, due to the Anarcho-Syndicalists leadership, of an
adventurous and wearying character. As a result of this false line, of
late the C.N.T. has lost its membership steadily so that in 1932 toward
the end of the year it had not much more than 400,000 workers.
<p>The C.N.T. is controlled by a so-called Federation of Iberian Anarchists
(F.I.A.). The false adventurist utopian direction which the F.I.A. has
given to the unions has resulted in a split, another &#8220;Group of 30&#8221; headed
by Pestanya arising. If the Anarchists think of political action and want
to smash the state by a conspiracy supported by the unions, the Pestanya
group stands against revolution and wants the syndicates to be pure and
simple economic organizations fighting for everyday reforms only. This
group declares it stands for a &#8220;practicable view&#8221; of the role of the trade
unions in Spain. Between these two groups then there goes on a struggle
which bids fair to convulse the whole C.N.T.
<p>However, the C.N.T. is still the most powerful revolutionary organization
in Spain. It issues two daily papers: &#8220;Solidaridad Obrera&#8221; put out in Barcelona
and &#8220;C.N.T.&#8221; published in Madrid. In its structure the C.N.T. stands as
a sort of cross between French Syndicalism and the I.W.W. Gradually it
is outgrowing its earlier Anarchist theory in the course of the Revolution.
Its local unions are now industrial and not close to the local trade union
centers. In 1919 these local centers had a great deal of autonomy but the
Trade Union Congress in 1931 in Madrid definitely declared for the formation
of National Centralized Industrial unions and a centralized national general
center. Thus more and more a Communist ideology is taking hold in the C.N.T.,
an ideology stimulated by the work of the Spanish Left Opposition and supported
by the fact that the mass of members are not skilled craftsmen but the
bulk of miserably exploited unskilled proletarians.
<p>To this report we must add that in June 1932 a new trade union center
was organized by the Communist Party of Spain. This is a direct result
of the sterile disloyal policy of Stalin. The history of this new trade
union center which now has the name of the Trade Union Unity Committee,
is briefly as follows: It must be recalled that during the dictatorship
of Primo de Rivera the C.N.T. had practically disappeared. Under Berenguer
it already began rapidly to revive. At that time the C.P. had organized
a &#8220;Committee of Reconstruction&#8221; to reconstruct the C.N.T. and used the
trade unions of Seville as a base. But already the C.N.T. had been thoroughly
reorganized so that the Seville actions were really acts of schism, splitting
the C.N.T. and drawing the fire of the workers on that account. Originally
it was a method of the Party to penetrate into the C.N.T.
<p>However, in 1931 the &#8220;new turn&#8221; of the Comintern hit Spain and the Communist
Party transformed the Committee of Reconstruction to a &#8220;Unity Committee".
The Communist Party claimed it had 700,000 workers behind it. Really it
had but 80,000. To the conference in 1932 only small unions in the provinces
and the trade unions of Seville responded. The tobacco and commercial workers
of Madrid came as observers only and withdrew. When we consider that after
the Revolution at times 85% of the Spanish proletariat were organized in
the C.N.T. and U.G.T. we can appreciate better the correctness of the Stalinists
line of breaking up the old unions. The weekly paper of the &#8220;Trade Union
Unity Committee&#8221; called &#8220;Unidad Syndicale&#8221; has become the symbol of the
new splitting policy of the C.I.
<p>We turn now from the trade union organizations of the working class
to their political organizations. First, the Socialist Party. The S.P.
has between 15,000 to 20,000 members at an estimate. It is strong in places
where its unions are strong and besides in Andalusia and Castille where
it has peasant connections. In Catalonia the separate Socialist Party which
had existed there and which had its own paper &#8220;Justitia Sociale&#8221; has now
fused with the Spanish Socialist Party. As we have seen the Socialist Party
supports the bourgeois regime, refuses to take power, but is part of a
ministerial coalition in which it has received the ministries of Labor,
Public Instruction and Public Works.
<p>Between the Socialists and the Communists and nearer to the Socialists
stands the Maurin Group, all of whose original membership came from the
Communist Party but split in 1930 when about 500-600 followed Maurin. This
group is strong only in Catalonia and there more in the province than in
the city of Barcelona proper.
<p>After the split Maurin formed an Iberian Communist Federation with about
1,000 membership and a weekly paper &#8220;La Batalla". In 1930 it was able to
get the &#8220;Communist Party of Catalonia&#8221; a separate and rationalist Communist
Party to fuse with it and thus strengthened itself. In 1931 the Iberian
Communist Federation organized a so-called &#8220;Workers-Peasants Bloc&#8221; a loose
organization which now has close to 5,000 members (1,000 in Barcelona).
The Maurin group is a typical nationalist centrist body losing more and
more of its character as a Communist organization.
<p>Before the Revolution, the Communist Party had about 2,000 members which
were not well organized. Now it has about 5,000 until very recently headed
by Bullejos and Trilla. As we have reported in the last issue of Class
Struggle (see Volume II no. 10-11) suddenly the whole Political Committee
of the Spanish Communist Party has been expelled including Bullejos and
Trilla, as &#8220;traitors".&#8212;TRAITORS no less! The Communist Party puts out
two weekly papers: &#8220;Frente Rojo&#8221; issued in Madrid with about 2,000 circulation
and &#8220;Las Masas&#8221; published in Barcelona and having 5000-6000 circulation.
The Communist Party also publishes irregularly a theoretical organ &#8220;Bolshevismo".
This is put out mainly as a counter to the theoretical organ of the Spanish
Left Opposition &#8220;Comunismo".
<p>As for the Left Opposition in Spain we can do no better than quote from
our article in Vol II no. 9 of the Class Struggle entitled: &#8220;A Report on
the European Sections of the International Left Opposition".
<p>&#8220;The first conference of the Spanish Left Opposition was held in Luxemburg
in 1929 with La Croix and five other members present. In 1930 another conference
was held this time in Madrid with about the same number of people (Nin,
La Croix, Andrade, Ferson) but it was only in the earlier part of 1931
that the Left Opposition really began to grow. The recent conference held
in April 1932 with 25 delegates represented over 1100 members. Within a
year it has put out a paper &#8220;El Soviet&#8221; now struggling to become a weekly,
with 5,000 circulation. It has issued a theoretical organ, &#8220;Comunismo&#8221; with 1500 circulation and over 15 popular pamphlets have been printed with
a large sale. A youth paper &#8220;Young Spartacus&#8221; has recently appeared which
it it claimed sells 2,000 copies. In quality the Left Opposition is stronger
than the Party (though not numerically, the Party having about 5,000 members)
and in many places the Left Opposition has groups where the Party has not
(as in Salamanca).The last conference found the Left Opposition best developed
in Biscay, Asturias, Castille, Andalusia, (Seville, Cadiz) Barcelona and
Madrid. (However, the group in Barcelona is numerically relatively small,
considering the importance of the place).
<p>&#8220;The last conference of the Left Opposition accomplished a good deal
and worked out elaborate theses on the situation in Spain, the position
of the Left Opposition on the national and agrarian questions, their relation
to the Party and to the syndicalists and on the trade union question. Within
the Left Opposition differences are arising as to the correctness of the
Spanish comrades but two things stand out clearly: 1. The great growth
of the Spanish Left Opposition due to its bold independent working class
activity. 2. The recogition it has received as the most dangerous revolutionary
force in Spain. In Catalonia only the Left Opposition is illegal (the Communist
Party is legal there) and the Chief of Police in a special brochure has
declared that Spain must account it as a stroke of good fortune that the
Communist Party has ejected the Left Opposition and that the leaders of
the Left Opposition are not the head of the Party. (see Maurice Karl: Communism
in Spain pg.91)".
<p>What are the perspectives of the Revolution? It is very clear that after
the Sanjurjo defeat the Revolution has taken a new turn to the Left. It
is also very clear that the Revolution is at a crossroads, that the unstable
equilibrium which now exists cannot long endure. Either the triumph of
reaction or the dictatorship of the proletariat.
<p>But for the dictatorship of the proletariat there is needed a complete
transformation of the subjective element, the proletariat. In no country
in the world has the opportunist adventurist criminal blunders of the anarcho-syndicalists
become so decisive as in Spain. The Syndicalists know how to use the general
strike to defend the republic, that is the republican bourgeoisie, but
they do not know how to use it to break the bourgeois republic and to seize
power! By their ignorant blunders they know only how to play into the hands
of the reformist Socialists, to weary out the masses and to prepare the
way for Fascism.
<p>The legalist and bourgeois character of the Spanish Socialist Party
has become patent to all. Indeed Prieto its leader has declared the Socialist
Party does not want power in Spain as Spain is in no condition to have
Socialism. To help the bourgeoisie, to pave the road even for the return
of Alphonso, to defeat at all costs the victory of the working class, this
is the despicable role of the Socialists.
<p>As usual the crimes of the Socialist Party are matched by the blunders
of the Communist Party. The bureaucratic splits, the theory of democratic
dictatorship, the general bankruptcy and vulgarity of the Communist Party
has isolated it and rendered it impotent.
<p>Only the Left Opposition can lead the working class out of the impasse.
The works of L.D. Trotsky stand as a beacon light showing the way. The
Spanish Left Opposition has a glorious opportunity. Let us boldly use it
and it may be that the Left Opposition will yet lead the Second Soviet
State on to victory.

<p>*************************************</p>
<p><b>Red with Laughter.</b></center></p>

<p>The antics of the leaders of the Communist Party are not only tragic
but they are funny. How can a tradegy be funny to us? Because the methods
of the Party are so outmoded that they are ridiculous. Tactics become antics.
It is with laughter that mankind drops the far-outworn.
<p>Take the Hunger March. Is it not funny to see a wealthy woman a leader
of the &#8220;Hunger Marchers"? Not that we do not want all to participate in
the struggle against hunger. But at least the hungry ought to decide who
is to lead them. And it is certain there would be many more capable persons
found.
<p>And this airplane business. Benjamin was so far in the rear that he
needed an airplane to catch up with the march. Airplanes from New York
to Washington! There is Americansky business for you. The speed ought to
warm the heart of the Big Boss in Moscow. &#8220;Socialism by the Second Five
Year Plan&#8221; is matched by &#8220;The Hunger March by Airplane.&#8221; <p>Was it not funny to see how the future &#8220;leaders&#8221; of the Hunger March
were elected. A Party leader gets up. &#8220;We want to introduce to you blah
blah blah blah. All those in favor. Unanimously elected.&#8221; And so Amter,
Reynolds et al become the Hunger Leaders in permanence, that is until Stalin
later finds them out to be &#8220;traitors&#8221; and expells them. (see the Spanish
situation)
<p>The Hunger March was not so much a threat to Washington, as it was a
threat to the militant vanguard that went on the march. The party generals
carefully isolated the vanguard from the masses, saw to it that they were
starved, crushed, frozen, clubbed and punished plenty. This is good for
the vanguard you see. &#8220;It hardens them". But what would we say to a general
that carefully picked out the best in his army and without boots sent them
into the frozen icy mountain tops to stand exposed where they could be
shot down by unseen enemies who surrounded them on all sides? The least
that could be done is to be sure that no more airplanes were provided for
such leaders. The vanguard must be not only a pretty hardened lot but pretty
backward if it can stand such leadership for long. As a matter of fact
the conscious American workers know this leadership very well. That is
why many are not in the Communist Party.
<center>
<p>The leader of the American Communist Party should be Charley Chaplin!</center></p>

<p>The Hunger March has been even made into an institution! We just received
word that &#8220;Truck D&#8221; is going to have a party and all the &#8220;Hunger Marchers&#8221; of &#8220;Truck D&#8221; should bring their friends for a good time. Is it any wonder
that the capitalist press put &#8220;Hunger Marchers&#8221; in quotation marks?
<center>
<p>We suggest the following song for &#8220;Truck D".</center></p>

<p>&#8220;We are the boys of old Truck D&nbsp; you hear so much about.
<br />"The people stop to stare at us whenever we go out
<br />"We&#8217;re noted for our parties and our little jamborees
<br />"Our airplanes and our pullmans and our little comfy sprees
<br />"While we go marching&#8212;And the paid band begins to play
<br />"You can hear us shouting &#8216;Hunger March Hunger March Ray Ray Ray&#8217;&#8221; <p>We suppose at this point an old timer will get up and say:
<br />"Boys, you remember the Hunger March of 1932? Them was the good old
days. Nothing like it now, by heck! In those days men was men.&#8221; <p>We bet we know who originated this Hunger March idea. We give the credit
to William Z . Foster. It was during the Passaic Strike when Foster together
with Wm. F. Dunne (now known anti-bureaucratically as &#8220;Bill") brought in
a motion &#8220;Since the Passaic Strike is lost, let us take all the strikers
and charter a boat that will take them from New Jersey to New England and
march them through all the textile towns as a demonstration.&#8221; Fortunately
due to our bitter opposition this treacherous motion was defeated. But
the logic at the bottom of these &#8220;dramatic&#8221; or rather comic gestures is:
Since the workers are defeated, lets have a &#8220;demonstration".
<p>But the workers are not defeated, gentlemen. Not yet. In spite of the
fact that like the yellow Socialists you have failed to do any work in
the proletarian neighborhood, to lead those movements that will culminate
in the poor workers helping themselves to what they need. The Fosters and
the Dunnes leave it to Bill Green to talk about direct action.
<p>One final comic strip. After we put out our program for the unemployed,
Cannon begins to attack us. He is afraid workers will begin to take our
claim seriously that we are Trotskyites. He must stall this off at all
costs. Therefore Cannon, after a sort of truce, begins again his policy
of lying about us. He tells the deliberate lie that we wanted the Hunger
March to declare a general strike. No, dear popgun. The general strike
is to be called by a united front conference, the backbone of which are
the trade unions. The Hunger March is to raise the slogan. Why do you lie?
The leaflet was very clear. And you know our point of view very well. We
shall not let you stay inside the Left Opposition, if you keep on lying
like that.
<center>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center></p>

<p>To change the subject. Cannon is lecturing at Lovestone&#8217;s Forum. Lovestone
is advertising Cannon&#8217;s meeting. We wonder why? Lovestone is a slick guy.
He knows his onions. There is no class struggle between those two babies.
We wonder if Lovestone will get the cash and give the credit to Cannon?
In that case Lovestone wins double!
<center>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center></p>

<p>Lovestone says Trotsky is a counter-revolutionist but he says that Cannon&#8217;s
group is a Communist one. That can mean only one of two things: Either
Communism is counter-revolution to Lovestone, or Cannon does not represent
Trotsky. Perhaps Lovestone means both!
<center>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center></p>

<p>Last issue we reported on our fine meeting at Perth Amboy. The Party,
to counteract this meeting brought out Max Bedacht to open fire against
the &#8220;Trotskyites". What was the net result? The next time we have a meeting
we had twice as many people present as before, about 90 people, all the
party members and all the sympathizers came around. We hope Bedacht will
keep up the good work as Trotsky-killer.
<center>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center></p>

<p>At one of our forums we challenged Cannon to debate us on the Negro
question. The Cannon leadership will not debate us because we are too small.
But our forum attendance is now twice that of the Cannon group. What about
it?
<center>
<p>*****************************************</p>
<p><b>Buried Treasure&#8212;James P. Cannon (Served with Pepper)</b></center></p>

<p>How many times have we been called &#8220;Slanderers&#8221; by Cannon and Shachtman
because we wrote in our general theses March 1931 &#8220;The whole history of
the Cannon group leadership makes it entirely unfit to carry out the principles
of the International Left Opposition in this country&#8230;&#8230;.(6) Cannon was
the first to make an alliance with Pepper (1923); (f) he was the first
to unite with Lovestone against Trotsky (1925). (As a member of the Polcom
he was in a position to know the true facts at the time)&#8230;". Now we print
without any comment the minutes of the ECCI Plenum of April 1925.
<p>&#8220;April 6th evening. The resolution on the discussion in the Russian
Communist Party was voted upon and unanimously adopted.
<p>&#8217;The Enlarged Plenum asserts that Comrade Trotsky&#8217;s conduct, which served
as the cause of the outbreak of a fresh discussion in the ranks of the
R.C.P. signified an attempt to revise Leninism and to disrupt the leadership
in the R.C.P.
<p>&#8217;The Enlarged Plenum asserts that this action was supported by all the
forces hostile to Bolshevism. Inside the Comintern, it was supported by
all the right wings in the Communist Parties by those elements whose tactics
have been frequently denounced at International Congresses, as being semi-Social-democratic.
Outside the Comintern, the action was supported by a number of persons
who have been expelled from the Communist ranks (Levi, Rosmer, Monatte,
Balabanova, Hoeglund and others).
<p>&#8217;Finally the social democratic and bourgeois press did their utmost
to take advantage of Trotsky&#8217;s conduct.
<p>&#8217;Consequently, objectively, this action was not only an attempt to disrupt
the ranks of the R.C.P. but caused the greatest injury to the whole of
the Comintern.
<p>&#8217;The Enlarged Plenum of the E.C.C.I. declares that it wholly associates
itself with the resolution of the Plenum of the Central Committee of the
R.C.P. in both the part giving an estimation of the principles of Trotskyism
and the part indicating the measures to be taken.
<p>&#8217;The Enlarged Plenum of the E.C.C.I. is of the opinion that the R.C.P.
must continue in the future to put up a similar resistance against all
attacks upon the Leninist theory and practice. The Plenum welcomes the
educational campaign of an equally high level against anti-Leninist deviations
should be conducted by the Communist Parties of other countries.
<p>&#8217;The Plenum is of the opinion that only by maintaining complete unity
of leadership can the Russian C.P. fulfil its great historical mission
to the end. Every attempt to shake this unity must cause extreme injury
to the whole of the C.I. and will therefore meet with the most stern and
determined condemnation on its part.

<p><b>Illegality and the Communist Movement&#8212;Vera Buch</b></center></p>

<p>Broadly speaking, the Communist movement, before the Revolution is always
illegal, in the sense that it is a conspiracy of an oppressed, propertyless
class to overthrow the class which is still in possession of the means
of production as well as of political power. Our use of the word &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; must by no means be interpreted to mean &#8220;adventure&#8221; or &#8220;putsch". We fully
understand the necessity for an objective basis for the success of the
proletarian revolution as well the guiding role of the steeled Communist
Party, possessed of revolutionary science. Our meaning will be plainest
if we compare the workers situation now with that of the bourgeoisie when
they seized power. They had already come into possession of the means of
production and had become economically the master class, wealthy and influential,
while the political framework of feudal society still endured. Their revolution
had to overthrow this political hindrance and as a final step to abolishing
feudal ruling classes and seating themselves firmly in the saddle. Now
on the contrary, the political blow which overthrows the capitalist state
power and sets up a proletarian one, initiates the seizure of the means
of production on the basis of which the socialist society can be built.
We see the Communist parties with all the wealth and influence of capitalist
rule against them carrying on as it were in darkness, mole-like preparatory
work building up their ideological base.
<p>The legality which the Communist movement is granted in democratic countries
is at best but partial. Any but the most naive people are aware that in
the U.S. where democracy has flowered as freely as anywhere the constitution
itself embodies various checks upon democracy which are likewise safeguards
for the propertied class, as for example, the existence of two legislative
bodies, the Senate, the supposedly more conservative, serving as a check
upon the House; such as the President&#8217;s veto and the Supreme court an arch
conservative appointed body which sits upon decisions of State courts;
such as the gap between the election of a new President and his inauguration
during which time, if the ruling class sees democracy threatening its power
by the election of the wrong President (and this does not mean the replacement
of the Repubican Party by the Democratic Party) it can gather its forces
for the coup d&#8217; etat.
<p>Our constitution guarantees us free speech. Yet we see an American Civil
Liberties Union handling hundreds of cases annually of suppression of civil
liberties, denial of free speech and assemblage, etc. The workers movement,
even the trade union movement, is so familiar with attacks upon its liberty
by means of injunctions, frame-ups, etc. that it is hardly necessary to
speak of them. As far as political bodies go, the government will suppress
the Communist Party whenever it seems to constitute a threat to its power
and the more acute the situation, the sharper the suppression. So in colonial
countries like China and India the Communist Party is generally illegal,
in Canada and in the French dominated countries which form a cordon sanitaire
around the U.S.S.R. in Europe (Poland, Roumania etc). While the Communist
Party as a whole is legal in the U.S. today many states have &#8220;criminal
anarchy&#8221; and &#8220;criminal syndicalism&#8221; laws which can readily be evoked against
C.P. members. The Fish Committee Anti-alien Bills to be proposed to Congress
constitute a smashing club against the foreign-born radical.
<p>&#8220;In the midst of life we are in death&#8221; those dismal words of the church,
may well be paraphrased for the Communist: &#8220;In the midst of legality we
are in illegality". Suppression of papers (Young Worker, denial of second
class mailing privileges to the Class Struggle etc) raiding of district
offices of the Party or the I.L.D. (Chicago, Birmingham etc). Arrests of
leaders have been comparatively frequent occurrences. In the period of
the Palmer Raids of 1919-1920 the C.P.U.S.A. experienced an illegality
of a rather artificial character. Surely the newly formed ultra-leftest
C.P. of those days (even though it claimed some 50,000 members) did not
constitute a menace to the U.S. government. The Red scare of that time
was due to a war hysteria combined to a reflex action of the Russian Revolution
which stirred up the government as well as the working class here. The
party, then not rooted among the masses quickly fell to 10,000 members
or less.
<p>When will illegality come again? This is really a test question. Will
those Communists who feel so secure in the present legal period, with its
many party-controlled organizations offering hundreds of jobs and those
who will toe the line, who are rooted in open methods of work stand the
tests of raids and suppression? This would at any rate sort out the wheat
from the chaff, the fakers would fly to cover and the real revolutionists
would appear in their true light. The outbreak of another world war would
bring on illegality. To say this may come within a year is without exaggeration.
It is possible that any real activity among the unemployed (even if not
stimulated by the Communists) would cause the government to drive the party
underground. Already we see the Michigan cases being revived.
<p>Preparedness is the only conclusion to be drawn. Is the Communist movement
prepared? Witness how all three Communist groups, the Communist League
of Struggle alone excepted, nonchalantly hand over lists of names and addresses
of their subscribers to the U.S. postoffice in order to get second class
mailing privilages for their papers, thus betraying the whereabouts of
thousands of radicals. Only a most amateurish movement would do this. The
utmost care in revealing membership, development of secret codes, etc.,
and many small precautions which should be ingrained in a serious Communist
Party are constantly flaunted. But most of all, the Party must be rooted
organizationally among the masses. A mere vague sympathy for its propaganda
will be of no help when raids, arrests, etc. descend.
<p>Shop nuclei in the factories and other work places which function under
cover in any circumstances cannot so easily be destroyed. The territorial
branch, whose meetings are exposed to any spies activities, are the loosest
possible form and can be wiped out at one swoop. The criminal failure of
the C.P. to build real lasting shop nuclei to any extent after so many
years (this was first ordered by the C.I. in 1921) is a plain unmistakable
confession that no real Communist movement as yet exists. Testing of membership,
struggle against espionage, can be carried out successfully only in such
workshop units where members know each other from daily contact on the
job. The combatting of espionage in the movement is an important subject
meriting another article. We only wish here in closing, without hysteria,
to sound a warning note. With the present divided, weak state of the Communist
movement, especially the state of the C.P. itself, with its raw untested
membership, its equally untested leadership depending for guidance on directives
relayed from Moscow and thence from one &#8220;higher up&#8221; body to another, (but
when we are illegal the cables will be cut and the incompetent emptiness
will stand exposed) a period of illegality, unless the situation is corrected
before then, threatens to smash the movement to atoms.
