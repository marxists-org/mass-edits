<h2 align="center">A Lesson from Chile to Socialists</h2></p>

</p>

<p class="sub">by Albert Weisbord</p>


<br />(From the magazine &#8220;La Parola del Popolo&#8221; November/December 1973)</p>

</p>

<p>IN CHILE everyone said their democracy was one of the most stable in the world. In Chile

military takeovers had not occurred as in the neighboring countries of Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay,

and Bolivia. In Chile there was no widespread fascist ideology such as had pervaded Argentine

under Peron, or Brazil under Verga. In Chile there was no preponderance of Indian former slaves

to bring to a frenzy the &#8220;conquistador&#8221; spirit of the Spanish rulers, but, on the contrary, Chile&#8217;s

demographic composition was thoroughly European.</p>

</p>

<p>In recent times the chief political parties in Chile, as in Italy, have been the Christian-Democratic, the Socialist, and the stalinist, with some fringes of anarchists and guerillistas of the

Jacobin Castro type.</p>

</p>

<p>The Christian-Democrats posed as democrats with principles of catholic love, charity, grace,

humanity, and what not. They said they would never oppose the will of the majority expressed at

the ballot box. They pretended to represent all the people, especially the middle class. They were

modeled after the Italian Christian-Democrats.</p>

</p>

<p>The socialists, under Allende, stated they were Marxists and represented the working class. They

wanted the end of capitalism and the introduction of socialism. Such a result could best be

obtained by the peaceful use of the ballot box. The old &#8220;oligarchy&#8221; of large landed proprietors

would have to be removed and the poor agricultural toilers given the land to have and to use in

cooperative fashion. The international (U.S.) corporations in the extraction and other industries

would be nationalized, but carefully, not violently, and with due compensation where necessary.

On the other hand, native Chilean capitalists would be spared and no harassment of the petty-bourgeoise would take place.</p>

</p>

<p>In a &#8220;left&#8221; Socialist Party certain questions had inevitably to arise:</p>

</p>

<p>1. Would the ruling classes of Chile give up power without a violent struggle, or would they

prevent democracy triumphing at the ballot box?</p>
<p>2. What would the Army do?</p>
<p>3. Are we going to wait before carrying out our program?</p>
<p>4. What will we do if a counter-revolutionary &#8220;putsch&#8221; is mounted to overthrow our socialist

government?</p>
<p>5. What about the United States, would they allow a &#8220;left&#8221; regime, similar to that in Cuba, to

attack U.S. property and then consolidate its power?</p>

</p>

<p>To this the &#8220;Marxist&#8221; Socialist Party of Chile had the following answers:</p>

</p>

<p>1. The political constitution of Chile is an exceptional one and allows us to take over peacefully.

The ruling class does not have enough popular support to stage any revolution before the

democratic elections can take place, and in these elections we will make sure that we have the

support of wide layers of the population by forming a People&#8217;s Front with the Christian

Democrats and with the stalinist communists who have shown they are really to the right of us

from whom we have nothing to fear.</p>
<p>2. The Army has a thoroughly democratic tradition. The military, despite the fact that it was

inspired by Prussian Junkers, surrounded by Franco friends, and technically trained in U. S.

academics for counter-revolutionary struggles, etc., will not form a junta to overthrow us before

the elections, and after that we will do our best to form our own counter-military and paramilitary

forces. Besides, a good part of the army is with us and supports our democratic traditions.</p>
<p>3. We will not wait with our program but will immediately proceed as far and as fast as possible.

We will make sure that the poor have received the benefit of the reforms we initiate so that they

will support us to the death.</p>
<p>4. If a counter-revolution occurs, the democratic government will crush it with all the force it

possesses. We are not for violence, but if the other side tries it, we&#8217;ll show them (echo of Willie

Pieck in Germany, &#8220;Let the Nazis take power, we&#8217;ll show them!&#8221;). We are Marxists, not petty

reformers; we are socialists, not liberals or right-wing social democrats. And is this not also the

program of the Nenni Socialists in Italy?</p>
<p>5. As for the United States, it is much farther away from Chile than from Cuba. The U. S. did not

officially attack Cuba and it will not dare to attack Chile.</p>

</p>

<p>Thus it was done. The People&#8217;s Front was organized. It won the democratic elections with the

Socialist Party and Allende at the head. The economic and social reforms were begun, the U. S.

international trusts were ousted and much property nationalized. The socialists were on the way

to socialism with the blessing of Castro, who visited Chile in support.</p>

</p>

<p>And now all is smashed. The parties of the People&#8217;s Front are declared illegal and being hunted

down like dogs. Thousands of socialists and popular front activists have been rounded up and

murdered in the public stadium and elsewhere, a la Franco.</p>

</p>

<p>Allende, himself, has been murdered in cold blood. A brutal military &#8220;putsch,&#8221; carried out by a

military junta in classic Latin American style and supported by all right wing capitalists and

petty-bourgeois elements, many of them formerly in the Christian-Democratic Party, has been

eminently successful. The counter-revolution has won.</p>

</p>

<p>Where did things go wrong? What was the basic error in socialist thinking?</p>

</p>

<p>Here we can not make the extended analysis that is necessary to explain the end of the socialist

dreams in Chile. What is most important is that the following conclusions are verifiable enough:</p>

</p>

<p>1. If the workers take office peacefully they take over only symbols of power, not the real power

itself. If the workers try to take power peacefully, they can not hold that power peacefully. If the

workers take power through the ballot box, they are not prepared for the inevitable violent

counter-revolution.</p>
<p>2. Only if the workers take power through revolution do they have a chance of beating and

defeating the counter-revolution. Only if the workers take power through revolution do they

purge themselves of their capitalist democratic illusions and become capable of holding power.

Only if the workers take power through revolution can they hope to defeat the armed military

forces representing the established capitalist state.</p>

</p>

<p>The events in Chile are casting their shadows above all in Italy. We say to those in the &#8220;centre-sinistra&#8221; front, those who have followed Saragat, Nenni, and Togliatti: <em>attenzione! </em>Chile shows

you are only playing with words!</p>
