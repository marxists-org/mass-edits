<p><b>On Disarmament and War</b>
<br />Thesis of the Communist League of Struggle</center></p>

<p>1. The onrushing imminence of another world war, the development of
pacifist degeneration in the ranks of the Communists as part of the general
process of degeneration in the Comintern since the death of Lenin and the
new factors which have arisen since the war make absolutely imperative
a new thesis by the Communists on the question of war and disarmament.
<p>2. It is as clear as crystal that a new world war is not only inevitable
but actually at our very doors. Especially during the past two years have
the contradictions of imperialism reached the breaking point. This breaking
point appears both in the East (China) and in the West (Germany) and takes
the form of violent conflicts which must lead to war. However, the breaks
are not localized merely in these two places but show themselves everywhere
(Ireland, Spain, Finland, Austria, India, Australia and New Zealand, South
America).
<p>3. At this time especially when the rise of fascism and the moves of
Japan in the Far East place the Soviet Republic and the working class in
great peril, the poisonous Menshevik speeches of Litvinoff and the policies
of Stalin must be denounced. They demoralize and disarm the proletariat.
They give aid to both the pacifist and jingoist capitalist chauvinists.
<p>4. Starting out from the false anti-Leninist viewpoint of &#8220;general&#8221; disarmament the Stalins and Litvinoffs have abandoned the ideology of class
struggle for that of class peace. The signing of the Kellogg Peace Pact
which proclaimed the idea that the world was a &#8220;family&#8221; of nations and
that the Socialist and capitalist nations must not fight with each other,
the more recent declarations by Litvinoff reported in the press that France
"at least during the past six months&#8221; had been a &#8220;force for peace". The
statement by Stalin that the Soviets and capitalists could exist peacefully
side by side and that the proof was that they have done so, and now the
climax&#8212;the speech by Litvinoff at the latest &#8220;disarmament&#8221; conference
proclaiming total disarmament as &#8220;the only way to end the war (!)&#8221; and
calling for &#8220;partial disarmament&#8221; (but leaving all arms intact for the
crushing of popular revolts) show plainly that the leaders of the Comintern
have abandoned Marxism, Leninism, and are betaking themselves to nationalism
of the worst kind via the theory of &#8220;building socialism in one country
alone.&#8221; <p>5. These speeches and statements of Litvinoff, Stalin and the Comintern
containing not the shadow of an exposure of the bourgeoisie, but class
collaborationist through and through, flow logically from the theory of
building socialism in one country. That theory, despairing of world revolution,
contemptuous of the Communist parties elsewhere, utopian in its belief
that capitalism would allow a country having an economic weight of at the
most 10% of the total world economy to outstrip the old society without
new and bloody world wars, that theory isolating the proletariat of the
Soviet Union from the rest of the world, stands exposed as laying the basis
for a new national socialism as treacherous and deadly as the national
socialism of the Second International during the last world war.
<p>6. The Communists cannot take the viewpoint of &#8220;general disarmament&#8221; or disarmament &#8220;in general". Lenin’s thesis is clear on this point:
<dir>
<dir>"To put ‘disarmament’ as a point in the program means to say in general
we are against the use of weapons. In this there is not a particle of Marxism
any more than if we said: ‘We are against the use of force’&#8230;&#8230;.The Kautskian
preaching of disarmament, addressed directly to the present governments
of the big imperialist powers, is the most vulgar opportunism and bourgeois
pacifism, serving the fact&#8212;in spite of the ‘good intentions’ of the
sweet-spoken Kautskians&#8212;to draw the workers away from the revolutionary
struggle. For by such preaching the idea is instilled into the workers
that the present bourgeois governments of the imperialist powers are not
enmeshed by the thousands of threads of finance capital and by scores of
hundreds of corresponding secret treaties among themselves.&#8221; <p>&#8220;Thus the chief defects of the demand for disarmament is exactly that
it evades all the concrete questions of revolution. Or do the supporters
of disarmament stand for a completely new view of an unarmed revolution?
&#8230;&#8230;.Disarmament is precisely a flight from nasty reality but not at
all a struggle against it.&#8221;</dir>
</dir>
7. The policy of the Soviet Union must not run counter to the interests
of the world proletariat, the best defenders of the Soviet Union. The world
proletariat has no interest in &#8220;peace&#8221; in general. It has an intense interest
in civil war, in colonial wars, in wars for the defense of the Soviet Union.
Only here lies the road to real peace. Again let us quote from Lenin, whom
the Comintern leaders have now forgotten:
<dir>
<dir>"An oppressed class which does not strive to learn to handle weapons,
to possess weapons, would only deserve that it should be treated as slaves.
We may not forget, without becoming converted into bourgeois pacifists
or opportunists, that we are living in a class society and that there is
not and cannot be any way out from that society except by class struggle
and the overthrow of the power of the ruling class&#8230;&#8230;.And in the face
of such a fact, the proposal is made to revolutionary social-democrats
(read Communists) that they put forward the ‘demand’ for ‘disarmament’!
This is equivalent to complete surrender of the point of view of the class
struggle, renunciation of all thought of revolution. Our slogan must be:
arming of the proletariat in order to conquer, to expropriate and to disarm
the bourgeoisie. This is the sole possible tactics for the revolutionary
class, tactics arising from the whole OBJECTIVE DEVELOPMENT of capitalist
militarism and prescribed by this development.&#8221;</dir>
</dir>
8. The pacifists who, basing themselves on the war weariness of the masses
and the petty- bourgeois horror of the cost of the war, which to a considerable
extent they must pay, have grown greatly since the last war, are deceived
by and beguile others with the very slogans and illusions by which the
great predatory powers fought the last imperialist war. In deadly fear
of revolution, they come out against ALL war, for &#8220;general&#8221; disarmament,
for &#8220;general peace". Everywhere the pacifists are using Litvinoffs speech
as a club against militant workers. In the meanwhile the militarists use
these &#8220;peace&#8221; societies and illusions for their own purposes.
<p>Particularly is this true for the U.S. where due to historical circumstances
(wide-spread illusions of liberalism, lack of many wars fought on U.S.
territory, lack of large colonies directly and openly owned by the U.S.,
the method of entrance into the last world war, etc.) and to the physical
geographic isolation of the U.S. from the other great powers, the pacifists
societies flourish and are used as a mask by the imperialists themselves
to cover up their war preparations to an even greater extent than elsewhere.
<p>Who is fooled by the slogans and phrases that &#8220;The Soviet Union Stands
for Peace"? The hard-boiled militarists and fascists of a dying capitalism?
--- No, it is the masses who are at the same time fooled and disillusioned.
On the one hand they are fooled into hoping that through the disarmament
conferences capitalism can reach &#8220;peace&#8221; from imperialist wars. And this
at the very moment when armaments and preparations for war have broken
all bounds. On the other hand, the masses are disillusioned with the internationalism
of the Soviet Union at the very moment when an aggressive stand for the
international revolution has become more imperative than ever.
<p>The second Congress of the C.I. under the leadership of Lenin has declared
"Proletarian Internationalism&#8230;.demands&#8230;.the capability and the readiness
on the part of one nation which has gained a victory over the bourgeoisie
of making the greatest national sacrifices for the overthrow of international
capitalism". Now when revolutionary outbursts are taking place everywhere
and the international proletariat looks to the Soviet Union, its Fatherland,
and the Red Army for AID in these revolutions, at this very moment it is
given the slogan &#8220;peace". &#8220;The sole aim of the U.S.S.R. is the building
of Socialism within its territory&#8221;, etc. Such slogans can only demoralize
the revolutionary proletariat and lead it to utter rout. It is another
proof to the world proletariat that the Stalin regime considers them mere
pawns in the game which Soviet diplomacy at the moment means to play.
<p>10. What shall by the attitude and policy of the proletariat toward
the armament plans put forth in their respective countries? Here first
of all the proletariat must examine the concrete circumstances of each
proposal historically conditioned by time and place. The proletariat cannot
be against all wars or against all armament proposals. &#8220;One of the biggest
in the formulation of the question e.g. concerning defense of the Fatherland,
among certain &#8220;lefts&#8221; consists in adequate concreteness in the answer.
It is much truer to say that in the PRESENT imperialist war defense of
the Fatherland is a bourgeois reactionary delusion, than to advance a &#8220;general&#8221; proposition against &#8220;every&#8221; defense of the Fatherland. It is not true and
it does not &#8220;hit&#8221; the immediate enemy of the workers inside the workers
parties, the opportunists.&#8221; (Lenin)
<p>While viewing the question concretely, however, all the more must the
Communists pursue rigidly the policy of favoring those proposals which
would arm and train the proletariat and toilers and disarm and demoralize
the ruling class. At the same time it must always be made plain that the
Soviet Union can never undertake wars with the motives of the imperialists
--- wars of aggression for self-aggrandizement.
<p>11. In the light of these principles the Communist League of Struggle
proposes the following concrete program of action:
<br />&nbsp;
<blockquote>1. The proposals of the Russian proletariat at the Disarmament
conferences must no longer be &#8220;General Disarmament&#8221; or &#8220;Complete disarmament
of all nations". It is not for us to demand the disarmament of China, of
India, of the colonies generally, or of Russia itself. The Soviet Union
must demand the disarmament of all the great powers (England, U.S., France,
etc.) but not the disarmament of the oppressed nations, the subject nationalities
and the colonies. The Soviet representatives must show that only when the
workers are armed can there be really peace and propose as a method of
securing permanent peace the arming of the workers and toilers generally.
It is a fact that only when the workers and peasants seized arms did Russia
obtain peace in 1917 and this fact must be hammered home to all the peoples
as the sole method of obtaining peace. Such a policy in the disarmament
conferences would bring a class line into the debates, awaken the masses
as to the true role of the Soviet Union as the herald of peace.
<p>2. Simultaneously with this demand for the disarmament of the big powers
allowing only the people, workers and peasants, to be armed, the Soviet
Union must make every effort to break up any attempt of the capitalist
states to form a united front against it. For the Soviet Union to form
alliances that break up the enemy, give a further breathing space to the
Soviet Union, and aid the world revolutionary forces is a practical Leninist
policy that especially now during the present crisis, when the capitalists
states are fiercely fighting each other and capitalism is further disintegrating,
must be pursued with the greatest vigor.
<p>In America the proletariat must fight for the recognition of the Soviet
Union and the extension of long term large scale credits to it. This is
one of the best steps of launching a movement for the defense of the Soviet
Union. Such a move is especially timely now in view of the depression and
in view of the sharpened hostility between the United States and Japan.
<p>3. The advance of Japan into Manchuria threatening the Soviet Union
and the sharpening danger of war between Japan and the Workers Fatherland,
places before the working class of the world the general question, what
shall be their attitude in case of such a war, and the special question,
what shall be the position of the proletariat of the U.S. in case of a
war between Japan and the Soviet Union.
<p>In regard to the general question we must declare that war against a
country warring against Russia is objectively a progressive war furthering
the world revolution and breaking up the camp of the enemy. The proletariat
must not be against such a war. Quite the contrary, the duty of unconditional
defense of the Soviet Union demands that the proletariat and its allies
do all in their power to destroy the state which is at war against the
Workers Fatherland.
<p>Should the country fighting Japan then at war with the Soviet Union,
be an imperialist country (U.S.) then it is the duty of the working class,
while not opposing the war, which is objectively progressive, nevertheless
strenuously to expose the imperialist aims and methods of the U.S. government
in its conduct of the war and to strive unceasingly and by every means
for the overthrow of the government of the U.S. so that the armed people
can really wage this war successfully for the succor of the workers republic
against the imperialist predatory powers attempting to destroy it.
<p>Of course we are aware that in the event of one imperialist power (Japan)
attacking the Soviet Union, there is great probability that the antagonisms
among the imperialist powers (Japan and the U.S.) would for the moment
be set aside in order to unite for concerted attack, drawing in other powers
as well against the enemy of all capitalism, the working class of the Soviet
Union. Such an eventuality becomes even more probable if events in Germany
(such as a Fascist coup) should weaken the working class in Europe and
thus open up a favorable opportunity to attack the Soviet Union from Europe
as well as in the East.
<p>In the case of Japan warring against the Soviet Union, or against the
Chinese people and Chinese revolution, the proletariat of such imperialist
countries as the U.S. must demand the complete abolition of trade with
such aggressive country, and strive to stimulate strikes in the factories
and transport industries to effect this abolition. It must demand the withdrawal
of all armed forces of all imperialist countries, including those of the
U.S. above all, from the colonial countries or workers republic. At the
same time the proletariat must demand that &#8220;their&#8221; government aid the oppressed
workers country or colonial people in every possible way, through credits,
loans, gifts, supplies, and, if necessary, men. This demand must be raised
in order to expose the true imperialist character of the government (which
will not aid the oppressed people of the colonial country) and to point
out clearly where are the friends and where are the enemies of the working
class, and to whom aid must be given. It serves as a rallying point for
those forces which wish to aid the world revolution and expose those which
are against it.
<p>Never must the proletariat forget to point out, under these circumstances,
that the imperialist governments under which they live will never honestly
carry out such aid as they demand to the attacked colonial peoples and
workers republic and must strive to mobilize the rest of the toilers for
the overthrow of &#8220;their&#8221; own imperialist government so as to really aid
the attacked colonial people or workers republic.
<p>4. The Proposal for Universal Military Training.&#8212;Here too the proletariat
and toilers cannot take a &#8220;general&#8221; position. In the colonial countries
(China, India, Nicaragua, etc.) where the imperialists rule through mercenary
armies, here the demand for a peoples army, or universal military training,
would arouse the masses to enthusiasm and fill the rulers with the greatest
dread. The Communists must favor these proposals in such countries and
try to realize them. In the European countries where for the most part
the masses have become radicalized and where mass national armies were
disbanded after the Russian soldiers had shown the way, here the Communists
must not necessarily oppose universal military training. On the one hand
the workers will obtain training and arms, but on the other hand they are
already beyond the stage of needing training, (at any rate the older generation)
having gone through the last world war, and are objectively ready for revolution.
Here at appropriate moments (at revolutionary crises) the Communists must
raise the slogan for Workers Militia as a transitional slogan to the Dictatorship
of the Proletariat. In such countries as the United States, on the other
hand, the masses need the training and use of arms so as to prepare themselves
for civil war successfully. On the other hand, the situation has not matured
sufficiently for the slogan for workers military training to be understood
at the present time. It is significant that the ruling class in the U.S.
itself does not yet wish universal military training. Should it come the
Communists must not oppose it, for the reasons given above.
<p>5. In the United States the Communists must take clear positions in
regard to other militarist proposals, the ROTC, the CMTC, and the National
Guard. In regard to the ROTC, the Reserve Officer Training Corps, the Communists
must present a steady opposition. All work within this bourgeois body must
tend to its destruction and nullification. In regard to the CMTC or Citizens
Military Training Camps, a different position must be taken. On the one
hand these camps take in wide numbers of workers and train them in the
use of arms. On the other hand, the workers are partially selected and
given a thorough bourgeois training that puts them in an entirely different
environment than a universally conscripted army would engender. Under these
circumstances the Communists cannot oppose nor raise the cry of boycott
of the CMTC’s nor yet advocate such camps, but must work within them raising
the class line in every possible way. In regard to the National Guard,
here the workers must do everything in their power to break and destroy
this specialized armed force of the bourgeois state. This does not preclude
work within this guard, slogans to favor the rank and file against the
officers, e.g. election of officers, etc.
<p>6. On the question of bonus to war veterans, too, the Communists must
mobilize the proletariat along the lines of a class policy. It is not correct
for Communists to mimic the American Legion Posts and merely advocate the
bonus for all (including tens of thousands of policemen, detectives, secret
service and other armed agents of the government who were formerly in the
service.) Not the bonus for all, but the bonus for all war veterans not
in the armed service of the State. This is the slogan that will focus the
attention on the fact that the government uses the bonus as a means of
building up a potential fascist army and means to harness the war veterans
to its chariot for use against the workers.
<p>12. The Communist League of Struggle submits these theses and concrete
proposals to the other Communist groups. It proposes that a series of joint
conferences shall be held to discuss them so that a unified Communist Leninist
program can be worked out.</blockquote>

<p><b>New Charlatanry of the C.P. Leadership</b>
<br />(Earl Browder on the War Danger)</center></p>

<p>In a special article entitled &#8220;On Some Problems in the fight against
the developing War Danger&#8221; published April 2<sup>nd</sup> in a special
supplement of the Daily Worker, Earl Browder , &#8220;theoretical leader&#8221; of
the Communist Party makes a slanderous attack on the thesis of the Communist
League of Struggle on Manchuria (see Class Struggle Vol 1 No.4 Oct-Nov.
1931).
<p>Before we deal with the views of the Communist Party speaking through
Browder we must first understand that on the question of China the Communist
Party has made a complete right-about-face. Never has a position been so
completely refuted by life itself; never has a leadership been revealed
so completely theoretically bankrupt as the Browder leadership of the C.P.
To prove this we need only turn to the previous system of guesses on China
put out by Browder on Nov. 3<sup>rd,</sup> 1931 in the Daily Worker: &#8220;What
is Behind the Secret Pacts?&#8221; <p>In this Nov. 3<sup>rd</sup> &#8220;thesis&#8221; Browder wrote:
<p>1. Japan enters Manchuria with the &#8220;sympathy and understanding&#8221; of the
United States. The antagonisms between Japan and the U.S. are no longer
real but only affected &#8220;&#8230;An agreement has been reached between the U.S.
and Japan for the division of China.&#8221; <br />2. Behind Japan stand also France, Germany and Italy, working together
with the U.S. It is England against Japan.
<br />3. The Cantonese are Japanese tools bought by Japan and are in a coalition
with the American tools of Nanking.
<br />4. Senator Borah speaking for American Imperialism had favored a Franco-American
understanding.
<p>We shall not stop to consider the other irresponsible remarks in this
thesis, that Great Britain now has a Fascist government, that &#8220;more than
40,000,000 persons in the U.S. are without the slightest means of livelihood
except the miserable crumbs of charity. Aside from these, the mere enumeration
of the above points in Browder’s earlier &#8220;thesis&#8221; exposes the utter bankruptcy
of the Communist Party. Not a single one of these guesses has come out
correctly.
<p>1. The Japanese adventure has brought clearly into relief the sharp
antagonisms between the U.S. and Japan, even leading to a movement for
the recognition of the Soviet Union, so as to ship arms and munitions there
most easily.
<br />2. Simultaneously it has become clear that England and France have
been supporting Japan against the U.S. and the mere suggestion that these
countries were cooperating with the U.S. is enough to cause laughter.
<br />3. The Cantonese have come vigorously against Japan, broken with Nanking,
and furnished the bulk of the troops in the battles.
<br />4. Senator Borah’s speech aroused the greatest resentment in France
against which country it was directed and far from cementing any alliance
between France and the U.S. it really showed a rather strained political
situation between them.
<p>But now the former &#8220;thesis&#8221; is a thing of the past. A new one is brought
out from the hat of the Party magician. Forgotten are all the former guesses
as quickly as the confused wanderings of a dream. There is no discussion
on the part of the Party members. No reasons are given for the change.
Nor is it stated there is a change. Simply the new &#8220;party line&#8221; is handed
down.
<p>What is the essence of the new &#8220;thesis"?
<p>1. The war in the Far East is primarily a mobilization of all forces
of imperialism against the Soviet Union. The main contradiction&#8212;in
fact the sole important contradiction in the world today is that between
decaying capitalism and the rising Soviet power.
<br />2. The antagonisms among the various imperialist powers cannot be considered
as a factor delaying the war against the U.S.S.R. and the partitioning
of China.
<br />3. The antagonism between the U.S. and Japan is recognized&#8212;"However
sharp the struggle between American and Japanese imperialisms"&#8212;although
it is considered as subordinate to the main antagonism.
<br />4. France and her allies with Japan are trying to &#8220;play upon&#8221; the antagonism
between the U.S. and British Imperialisms.
<br />5. A regrouping of the imperialist forces is taking place, the outcome
of which Browder cannot &#8220;see clearly".
<p>Let us first clinch the contradictions between these two &#8220;theses".
<p>1. The first one considered the United States as a tacit ally of Japan.
The last one recognizes an antagonism&#8212;even a sharp antagonism&#8212;between
these two countries.
<br />2. In the first &#8220;thesis&#8221; the principal European countries,&#8212;France,
Germany, and Italy, with the U.S. were secretly allied with Japan for an
attack on the Soviet Union. This was the famous &#8220;secret pact". Now we are
told something different, now France and her allies with Japan are trying
to &#8220;play upon&#8221; the antagonism between U.S. and British imperialisms.
<br />3. Browder was very definite in his first &#8220;thesis&#8221; about these alliances.
But now &#8220;there is taking place a regrouping and shifting of forces&#8230;.it
is impossible to see clearly the final alignment between the imperialist
powers.&#8221; <p>Needless to say, there are given no economic not political reasons why
these alliances should take place. Laval’s conferences with Hoover ---
probably having to do with the question of reparations&#8212;appears to have
been the base upon which the whole fantastic scheme of the &#8220;secret pact&#8221; built itself up in Browder’s feverish brain. Charlatanry takes the place
of analysis.
<p>The next question is: has there been a change in objective events, that
calls for a different analysis? But in such a case the author of the thesis
would himself explain the change, in order to justify his new conclusion.
Not so here; the second &#8220;thesis&#8221; simply flatly contradicts the first.
<p>Is there at least an advance towards a more correct line? Here we must
examine the theoretical basis of this &#8220;thesis". It rests upon the belief
that in the present period antagonisms among imperialist countries have
become completely subordinate to the antagonisms between the Soviet Union
and the surrounding capitalist world. This means that there cannot now
be a war between imperialist countries, there can only be a war of attack
against the Soviet Union, by the combined imperialist powers. The antagonisms
among the various big powers in the East cannot even be considered as delaying
the war against the Soviet Union and the partitioning of China.
<p>That the Communist League of Struggle appreciates to the full the danger
of attack on the Soviet Union is proved by our various articles on the
Chinese situation as well as on the elections in Germany. We quote here
from our thesis on Manchuria: published last November (Class Struggle Vol.
1 No. 4)&#8230;."Victory by Japan, on the one hand would intensify all imperialist
rivalry in China; on the other hand is a direct threat against the Soviet
Union. The imperialists still smart under the stinging defeat the Red Army
administered to the Chinese military generals and to imperialist diplomacy
over the Chinese Eastern Railway. The seizure of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia
offers imperialism a consolidated base of attack against Russian-Chinese
trade and against the Chinese Eastern Railway. It is a thrust to split
Siberia, a menace to Outer Mongolia (under Soviets) a move at Turkestan
and a threat of outflanking the Communist forces within China. Victory
by Japan imperils the whole Soviet Union, the Workers Fatherland. Against
such a victory the proletariat of the world led by the Communist International,
must fight".
<p>To think however that this is the only danger of war is to be blind
to the welter of intrigues and clashing interests, particularly where China
is concerned, which the crisis has rendered all the sharper. It is to repudiate
the theses of the third Congress of the Communist International which declared
that the principal antagonism in the world was that between Great Britain
and the U.S. and predicted that this antagonism will come to a head in
the Pacific and will be fought out through Japan. We recognize that in
the intervening period since the third Congress (1921) the growth of the
Soviet Union has pushed forward the Soviet-capitalist contradiction, but
we are still in a world where capitalist interests predominate, where Soviet
trade is at the most 10% of the worlds whole, and where capitalist antagonisms
are still pregnant with the danger of war. The principal antagonism among
capitalist powers brought to the fore in the Far East is that between the
U.S. and Japan.
<p>&#8220;Due to conflicting imperialist interest in Manchuria war may result
between the United States government and Japan, especially if the Soviet
Union has not yet entered the conflict. It is clear that such a war between
the United States and Japanese governments will be a war between two robber
governments over the question which will rob and plunder China. It is clear
that the American government reeking with the blood of the Chinese masses
cannot aid the Chinese masses. Not in the least fooled by the hypocritical
phrases that will be employed by the United States government, the American
working class must do all in its power to overthrow United States capitalism
just as the Chinese toilers must overthrow the Chiang Kai Shek and other
military cliques. Only a workers government in the United States can effectively
war against Japanese imperialism, can effectively support the Chinese and
Russian revolutions.&#8221; (Thesis on Manchuria&#8212;Class Struggle&#8212;Vol.
1 No. 4) That a war between the U.S. and Japan, at a time when Japan is
preparing actively for war upon the Soviet Union, seems obvious.
<p>What after all is the basis for the blindness in the Browder &#8220;thesis&#8221; --- a blindness which led to a delay on the part of the Party even to see
the menace to the Chinese masses, so that the first slogan issued was only
that of defense of the Soviet Union and only later was it realized that
the Chinese masses must also be defended. This blindness is traceable to
the dangerous attitude of the Communist leaders of the Soviet Union itself,
an attitude which infected the whole Comintern: the obvious intention of
the Soviet Union to stave off attack at any price&#8212;even to the extent
of pacifist propaganda and disarmament demands&#8212;so that it may be left
free to continue its own industrial development. In other words, here too,
the Menshevik theory of building Socialism in one country vitiates the
attitude on the war danger. The main slogan becomes on any and every occasion:
Defend the Soviet Union, while complete blindness prevails to such threatening
developments as the friction between the U.S. and Japan, or the rise of
fascism in Germany.
<p>The slanders against Trotsky in which Browder’s article indulges, are
conducted with the usual distortions. It is declared Trotsky had assured
the world that Japan will &#8220;not decide to take a directly aggressive action
against the U.S.S.R.&#8221; Trotsky’s explanation is of course not given, that
Japan is for the moment consolidating its position in Manchuria for future
attack. Nor is there mentioned the brilliant analysis Trotsky has made
of the situation in Germany, proving that if the Fascists are permitted
by the criminal negligence and failure of the C.I. leadership to seize
power in Germany, there is serious threat of annihilating the working class
organizations there, which would break down the best line of defense against
the Soviet Union and hence open the way for concerted imperialist attack.
<p>The statement that the &#8220;Social-Fascists&#8221; (so-called) &#8220;Trotskyites and
Brandlerites&#8221; are calling for fight only against American imperialism can
certainly not be applied to the Communist League of Struggle which in its
Manchurian thesis called for fullest support of the Chinese masses and
Chinese Soviets, for Defense of the Soviet Union, for withdrawal of all
imperialists from China, for support by the Soviet Union of the struggle
of the Chinese masses to drive out Japan.
<p>Finally we come to the vicious attack on the C.L.S. directly. &#8220;The same
purpose of paralyzing the mass revolutionary activity for the defense of
the Chinese people and the Soviet Union has the counter-revolutionary theory
of Weisbord and his little clique that of raising by the Communists the
demand for American imperialist war ships under the direction of Hoover
to convey American capitalist ammunitions to the Soviet Union in China
for a revolutionary war.&#8221; (Browder article)
<p>On the contrary, the Communist League of Struggle alone has advanced
concrete demands for the aid of the struggling Chinese masses. A full quotation
from our thesis on Manchuria will be enough to refute to the hilt these
slanders. &#8220;The proletariat and Communists in the United States have a particularly
grave responsibility. First of all the working class demand HANDS OFF CHINA
BY THE IMPERIALIST PLUNDERERS&#8212;STOP THE DISMEMBERMENT OF CHINA. But
the American proletariat must go further than this. It must demand the
IMMEDIATE RESTORATION TO THE CHINESE PEOPLE OF ALL CONCESSIONS SEIZED BY
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. It must demand the IMMEDIATE LIBERATION OF
THE PHILIPPINES AND OTHER COLONIES OF THE UNITED STATES and aid revolts
there. It must explode the hypocrisy and chicanery of American pretensions
and must thoroughly expose the imperialist aims of the United States Government
&#8230;.Secondly, the American workers must raise the slogan: FULL AID TO THE
CHINESE MASSES (ESPECIALLY THOSE IN SOVIET CHINA) IN THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST
IMPERIALISM (Japanese, American and others.) Supporting the Chinese people,
the working class must demand the complete prohibition of Japanese trade
to this country. Simultaneously the workers must demand that large military
supplies be given the Chinese people (Soviet China). The shipment of these
supplies must be defended at all costs even if necessary WITH THE WHOLE
ARMED MIGHT OF THE NATION.&#8221; <p>Now we refer the reader to a similar section in our recent thesis on
war and disarmament (published in the present issue): end of page 5: &#8220;In
the case of Japan warring against the Soviet Union&#8230;.and following. Here
it is made plain beyond a doubt that no illusions are possible that the
United States government will carry out the proposed demands, but that
the United States Imperialists will become thoroughly exposed. Compared
with the full, concrete demands and practical working out of the thesis
of the Communist League of Struggle, all statements of the official Party
on this question, which merely repeat the same few empty slogans, are hollow
as gas balloons. They serve only to expose again the complete bankruptcy
of the leadership.

<p><b>A Worker Looks at Food</b>
<br />(Worker Correspondence)</center></p>

<p>Food is that substance or substances for the lack of which so many workers
and their families are today weak and ailing. In the best of times, food
is a gypping proposition where vast profits are made by the manufacturers
and chain-stores and where workers lose out.
<p>The quality of food is determined by many factors, each one of which
must be closely watched and understood. One of the most important of these
is the adulteration of food and food products. Another is the improper
preparation of food whether the worker eats in restaurants or at home.
In restaurants the capitalist system which is interested in profits, not
in the workers health, means poorly prepared food, of low quality. In the
home where the wife also works, it means fried food, canned food, anything
that can be prepared in a few minuets.
<p>The adulteration and disguise of food takes place in many ways, some
of the most flagrant being the use of sulfur dioxide and benzoate of soda
as preservatives, of coal tar dyes and flavors, of such soothing substances
as borax formaldehyde and salicylic acid, of alum in baking powder and
yellow color in place of eggs, etc. Science has condemned the use of white
flour, white sugar and white rice, but the manufacturers spend millions
of dollars in advertising to foist these denatured food products upon the
public. The Pure Food Laws are supposed to protect the consumer but as
the ruling class controls all agencies of the law, these laws are enforced
as best suits the profits of the manufacturers. Pellagra in the Southern
states tells a terrible tale not only of lack of food but of a diet of
white flour biscuits, gravy and beans, lacking in fresh, green foods.
<p>One of the greatest abuses in food preparation in the last decade is
the tremendous speeding up of the food workers. Competition in the food
business is very keen. In order to make a profit, the restaurant owners
place additional burdens upon the food workers. They employ less cooks,
waiters, and waitresses, lengthen hours, combine jobs, etc. Another is
the use of left-over foods taken from the returned plates. This is especially
so in those places where workers must eat, the Busy-Bees, Coffee Pots,
Lunch Rooms, etc. In these places the scraps of butter are returned and
re-used, uneaten pieces of bread are made into puddings, portions of vegetables
into soups, pieces of meat are picked out and made into hash or stew and
sold again.
<p>The health conditions of food workers are among the worst. Condemned
to toil in dirty, unventilated and over-heated quarters they suffer greatly
from T.B. rheumatism, fallen arches, nervousness, etc. The organization
of the food workers is still an unsolved problem, for which active efforts
must be made.

<p><b>L.D. Trotsky On the Disarmament Question</b></center></p>

<p>1. The fundamental cause of the crisis can be put in one word: capitalism.
The special character of this crisis is explained by another notion: Imperialism,
that is to say, monopoly capitalism which is beginning to put reify in
its own blind contradictions. The rise and fall of Ivar Kreuger symbolize
all present day capitalism. The official moralists when all is done hurl
their thunderbolts against the match king. But he could answer: why did
you allow me to dispose at my own will of the productive forces of which
should be serving human society, under its own direction?
<p>Will the world capitalist order overcome the present crisis? The answer
depends upon what is understood by the term crisis. Variations of conjuncture
accompany the whole history of capitalism. In past epochs, the curve of
capitalism was rising through all the variations in conjuncture. Today,
it is falling. This does not exclude further variations of conjuncture
in the future. On the contrary, such are inevitable. But the sharp present
crisis can be softened only by leading into a higher paroxysm in the following
stage which is not far off. All this extremely painful process can be ended
only by a transformation of the whole social system.
<p>2. Have I any hopes for the success of the Disarmament Conference? Not
in the least. But in that, I am hardly an exception. The French plan is
characterized sufficiently by the fact that it is presented by the Tardieu
government. At the same time that France supports the bloody work of Japan
in the Far East, Japan gratefully supports the pacifist initiative of France
at Geneva. A lesson beyond compare for all peoples! France’s plan aims
to create, under the cloak of the League of Nations a new entente with
the sole aim of stabilizing the hegemony of French finance capital with
the aid of the &#8220;international&#8221; army.
<p>But the American plan also opens up no perspective. The present war
are not conducted with the arms which the belligerents possess on the eve
of the war, but with those which they manufacture in the course of the
war itself. From this point of view the U.S. has given a lesson to the
whole world and especially to Germany. The outcome of the future war will
be determined by the technical capacity of the warring countries. The higher
the industrial development of a country, the more this country is interested
in provisional limitation of armaments; then it will really be easier for
it than for its adversaries to equip its army with everything necessary.
<p>At the best, the Conference will end with hollow formulas. The inevitable
failure of the Geneva Conference will constitute a new impulse for the
armament race and will increase the danger of war.
<p>The Franco-Japanese policy, the warlike one as well as the &#8220;pacifist&#8221;,
is directed always more and more openly not only against China but against
the Soviet Union. That Litvinoff at the Geneva Conference expresses the
honest will of the U.S.S.R. not to resort to war, cannot be doubted by
any attentive observer. But I should like to hope that the Soviet delegation
will find a moment to pass from technico-pacifist proposals which, even
from a pedagogic point of view, have not much importance, to a more active
policy, that is, to tell the Conference openly how things are, and thus
to warn the peoples of the threatening danger. For, if there is a force
on our planet which can &#8220;limit&#8221; armaments on land and sea, it is the will
of the masses of the people.
<p>3. The rumors of the press as to my near return to the U.S.S&#8230;..do
not rest upon any serious foundation. It is rather a case of inventions
caused by the strained general situation. It is needless to say that that
fraction to which I belong will place itself entirely and completely at
the disposition of the Soviet Government. As a precedent, it may be shown
that at the time of the civil war, in 1918-20, Stalin, Voroshiliov, and
others were in sharp opposition to the methods of conducting the war which
I was following in full accord with Lenin, which did not prevent the oppositionists
of that time from taking an active part in the struggles.

<p><b>Current Comment</b>
<br />Not Unity At Any Price!</center></p>

<p>When we read the revelations in the Militant about the Lovestone unity
negotiated, we wondered: How is it Cannon is so close to the Lovestone
inner policies? How come the intimacy? But now we see that Cannon, green
with envy, feeling that if Lovestone has a show&#8212;or part of a show ---
to get back, maybe he has one too, proceeds to prostrate himself upon his
belly, offering anything if only he can get back into the Party. The statement
by the National Committee of the League &#8220;For the Communist Unity of our
Party&#8221; is about the limit for groveling sycophancy. Beyond the weak remark:
"we do not share the views upon which the present line of the party is
based&#8221;, there is not indication whatever of any determination to struggle
within the party until the victory of the Left Opposition prevails over
the Stalin leadership. Only the most self-abasing expressions of loyalty
such as &#8230;.."&#8230;..we put no conditions whatsoever &#8230;..&#8221; &#8220;we have never
attached any conditions to our collaboration and support&#8221;, etc. No demand
for the reinstatement of Comrade Trotsky and other leaders of the Left
Opposition! No stand on the membership of the other Communist groups! (Even
the Lovestone group took a stand on this question, and expressed its intention
to fight for the admission of the German and other oppositions). Does Cannon
think by such capitulation he can get back his soft jobs in the movement
to the tune of 45 per?
<p>We restate once more the position of the Communist League of Struggle
on unity, many times communicated to the other communist groups, but always
either unanswered or rejected: (From our thesis of April 1931) &#8220;In regard
to the utterly corrupt leadership of all three right wing groups our position
must be to eliminate them entirely from all influence in the Communist
ranks. In regard to the groups themselves, since they are after all Communist
groups, we must fight that the members of all groups be readmitted into
the Communist Party, not as groups but as individuals. The Communist League
of Struggle, however, can never abandon its grouping until the right wing
policies of all these groups are defeated and a Leninist line carried out&#8230;..In
the meantime the Communist League of Struggle must try to effect a united
front so that all Communist groups can work together on concrete issues
on the basis of the recognition of the Communist character of each group".

<p><b>Two Conventions&#8212;and a Plenum</b></center></p>

<p>The new platform and resolutions adopted by the S.P. convention represent
a clever piece of chicanery. One might say at first glance: the Militants
have won. But this is not the case, rather it is the pressure of the masses
with their untold miseries which is forcing the adoption of red phrases
by both militants and old guard. The S.P. is going in heavy for the coming
election, and if red phrases will get the workers vote, why not?
<p>This change of face in the Socialist Party is all the more dangerous
considering the failure of the Communist Party to make headway in spite
of the most favorable objective conditions. The party makes heroic efforts.
Such things as its leadership of the Colorado beet workers strike, the
Kentucky miners strike, its championing of the Negro masses, indicate the
militant orientation and basic soundness of the Party membership. That
there is communist sentiment among the masses is indicated too by many
things,&#8212;by the large 1<sup>st</sup> of May demonstrations, by the following
of the Party in demonstrations of the unemployed, notwithstanding the murderous
police terror, etc.
<p>But behind all the splurge which accompanies the Party nominating convention,
stand the cold facts revealed in the Plenum. &#8220;Bureaucracy&#8221; and sectarianism
the chief defects&#8221;,&#8212;100% turnover of membership,&#8212;circulation of
the Daily Worker decreasing, etc. The same tale of failing influence of
the C.P., of gain of the social-democratic influence, greets us in every
country. It is not shoutings of the leadership, confessing their faults,
(but never in the least correcting them) that will remedy the situation.
Only an awakening of the Party membership can do that. To bring about this
awakening is the task of the Communist League of struggle.
