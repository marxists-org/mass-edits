<br /><font size=+3>The Spanish Revolution at the Crossroads</font>
<br /><font size=+1>by Albert Weisbord</font>
<br />(from Class Struggle, Volume 2 Number 10-11 Nov./Dec. 1932)</center></p>

<p>Recent events have exposed the fact that the Spanish Revolution still
remains at the crossroads. It is still in its Kerensky Period, with a sort
of dual power manifesting itself. On the one hand, there are the workers
ever on the lookout, ever on guard to crush the enemies of the Republic;
but not organized in Soviets and having no adequate leadership and thus
incapable of seizing power for themselves. On the other hand, is the National
Cortes controlled by the bourgeoisie who would themselves prefer a more
stable regime even if it meant a return of the king. The Syndicates are
too weak to crush the bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie is too weak to crush
the Syndicates (revolutionary unions).
<p>This unstable equilibrium, though it has lasted over a year and a half
already, can not continue indefinitely. Either one or the other, wither
the workers will succeed in seizing power or all reactionary forces will
pool together to crush the proletariat and restore the monarchy if not
establish a regular Fascist dictatorship. The present unstable equilibrium
must come to an end either because of a shift of class forces within Spain
or by a shift in the international situation (say, Germany) or by a combination
of both. There is no question, for example, that should the Nazis crush
the communists in Germany, the Revolution (and the Republic) comes to an
end in Spain. While everything hangs in the balance, the proletariat in
Spain has shown its greatest strength when it is fighting a defensive fight,
against the Monarchists for example, and in doing the work which should
be done by the bourgeoisie but which the latter is too cowardly and weak
to do for itself. For example, take the last Monarchist attempt of General
Sanjurjo. Sanjurjo actually had the conspiratorial support of part of the
government and of the Civil Guard itself. It was not the bourgeoisie which
crushed this uprising, it was the savage action of the proletariat which
at once smashed to bits this reactionary movement, and although the government
saved the life of Sanjurjo from the wrath of the masses, even the government
was thrown for a loss and compelled to move to the left.
<p>The Bourgeoisie, frightened at the power of the masses, exposed as a
weak, tiny minority, utterly incapable of dealing with the Monarchists,
or saving the Republic, indeed exposed as a group allied with the Monarchists,
were forced to make concessions to the revolutionary forces. The government
was forced to confiscate the property of the counter-revolutionists, deport
their leaders, promise a greater reform in the army and for the peasantry,
and actually granted a very liberal autonomy to Catalonia. All this marks
a clear step forward in the Spanish Revolution, the appreciation of which
step can be better seen in connection with the past periods of the Spanish
Revolution.

<p>II</center></p>

<p>The first period, November 1929 to January 1930. This is a period prepared
by student riots, by the discontent of the bourgeoisie ground down by the
dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and by the economic crisis that affected
them on all sides. This period is marked by the first general strike in
November and December 1929. The workers here are supporting the students
and the bourgeoisie, they play no distinct role; they merely push the leaders
on to make the demand &#8220;Down with the King for a Republic&#8221; etc. The result
of this mass pressure is the fall of the Dictator Primo de Rivera January
1930.
<p>Succeeding Primo de Rivera is General Berenguer. He attempts to trick
the people. He concedes that a National Cortes should be elected, that
the absolutism of the Spanish Royalty be ended. But he means to fool the
people, to have the National Cortes elected not by the masses but by the
municipal delegates who have already been elected and who represent not
the will of the people but the old Monarchist clique as before. The trick
fails. All parties decide to boycott the fake elections. Army revolts backed
up by Anarchist elements occur. The proletariat enters the fray. The Second
General Strike is called. It starts from a small economic strike called
in Madrid by the Socialists. It is seized upon by the Syndicalists and
made into a general political strike that crushes Berenguer who falls March
1931 giving way to a provisional government headed by the Right wing Bourgeois
Aznar. The King flees the country (aided by the bourgeoisie).
<p>Real elections are then held. This marks the third period of the Revolution.
A unanimous vote is cast for a Republic in the municipal elections. A republic
is proclaimed April 14<sup>th</sup>, 1931. But the workers under the influence
of the revolutionary Syndicalists, wish to go further. They call a general
strike for April 15<sup>th</sup> It fails miserably, the Socialists fighting
it tooth and nail.
<p>Up to this point the Spanish Revolution has followed classic lines.
The Russian Revolution of 1917 and the French Revolution of 1848 are the
models. There is this difference, among others, with the Russian Revolution:
There is no Bolshevik Party, the working class is thus weaker and the bourgeoisie
relatively stronger. The King is not executed but allowed to escape. The
Monarchists while driven to cover, still control the army and government
posts. Spontaneous Soviets are not set up. But we see the same phases in
the Spanish as in the Russian Revolution; the King is overthrown, the Miliukov-Gotchkov
regime is ended and the &#8220;Bulygin Duma&#8221; period of 1905 is quickly passed
through (Berenguer period). A provisional government is set up that represents
the Kerensky period of the Spanish Revolution. As in Russia so in Spain.
At first the Socialists take part. But when the Monarchy is overthrown,
the Socialists defend the capitalists and fight the general strikes. As
in Russia so in Spain, the theory of the Socialists is that since the capitalists
are too weak to establish their rule, the workers must help them to establish
capitalism, since capitalism must come before Socialism. As in Russia,
the Socialists of Spain refuse to take power and bring in Socialism.
<p>As in the French Revolution of 1848, the Revolutionary masses first
demand a republic, then a republic with Social reforms. The ruling powers
too weak to stop the masses must grant certain reforms for a time. The
weak Louis Blancs (the Socialists) are taken into the government and flattered
(The Spanish Republic was actually called a &#8220;Workers Republic"!) but the
ruling class bides its time. It waits for its &#8220;June Days&#8221; to massacre the
toilers. If the &#8220;June Days&#8221; have not yet come around in Spain it speaks
volumes for the strength of the proletariat, the weakness of the bourgeoisie,
and the instability of the international situation: it bespeaks the fact
that we are in 1932 and not 1848. As the &#8220;June Days&#8221; period is delayed,
the workers grow bolder. They move from Social Reforms to Socialism, to
a demand on the part of the Communists that the workers seize power.
<p>The elections of July 28, 1931, to the National Cortes showed the situation
clearly. The Right Wing reactionaries got but 41 delegates out of a total
of 470. The Radicals, Radical-Socialists and Socialists together got about
275 seats and forming a bloc took over the government, the Socialists taking
three cabinet seats (labor, public instruction, public works) and were
quite content to remain in a minority. But such a government can not crush
the revolutionary forces which mount steadily in this period.
<p>The fourth period (to October 1931) of the Revolution sees the Revolution
move to the left. Many violent strikes break out all over the country.
A peasant movement is organized strong in Andalusia led by the agricultural
workers. The government is forced to confiscate the property of the King.
The Monasteries and church&#8217;s are attacked and the church and State separated.
The Jesuits are dissolved (but not banished, note). The separate government
of Catalonia is recognized and agrarian and military reforms promised.
A fourth general strike is attempted which is marked by a great deal of
violence. It is crushed.
<p>This period is followed by another (October 1931 up to the time of the
Sanjurjo attempt). The movement seems set back. The trade union Syndicalist
movement, falls from one million members to less than half. The Socialists
grow. Insurrections in the Potassium mines and in the textile factories
of Catalonia are put down. In November a drastic Safety Law of the Republic
is put over. The fifth general strike (January 1932) is quickly put down
&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. the Tarrasa insurrection in March.
<center>
<p>What can we say about these last two periods?</center></p>

<p>1. The Socialists openly take the role of shooting down the workers.
<p>2. The workers &#8220;experiment&#8221; with the attempt to seize power. (Note the
similarity with the &#8220;July Days&#8221; of the Russian 1917 Revolution). They fail.
A more sober mood sets in. The difficulties have become more apparent.
The Syndicalist movement becomes split. The foolish putschist tactics of
the Anarcho-Syndicalists become thoroughly exposed. A &#8220;group of 30&#8221; headed
by Pestana, denounces the attempt to use the trade unions as revolutionary
organs. This group fights for a moderate policy and going further, really
fights against the revolution itself. The Syndicalists are split. It is
this split that provokes the Anarchists to really seize the factories (fourth
general strike). From that time the Anarcho-Syndicalists decline.
<p>3. Refomism and liquidation tendencies grow. The Socialist Party, in
spite of its open treachery increases its influence due to the failure
of the revolutionary forces.
<p>4. The Communist influence grows. The workers see not the trade unions
alone, not putschism but a strong political party deeply embedded in the
masses can succeed. A period of reflection and of study has set in.
<p>The Reactionary forces mistook this period as one of defeat. They attempted
through General Sanjurjo to turn the defeat into a rout. They in turn were
routed. The Revolution enters into its sixth period with a decided swing
to the Left.
<p>As in the Russian Revolution, the Spanish Revolution has witnessed a
great flowering out of all parties and groups. Large finance capital and
secret adherents of the Royalty are represented by the newspaper &#8220;A.B.C.&#8221;,
while the large agrarians have their reactionary paper &#8220;Debate&#8221; and their
group headed by Zamora. These groups occupy the extreme Right Wing. Next
to them are the out-and-out bourgeois parties. The Radicals have the old
fox Lerroux as their spokesman who was the &#8220;Legal Left&#8221; under the king
but who is now far to the Right. In Catalonia, La Liga Regionalista occupies
the Right Bourgeois position. This league has a non-separatist position
and have Cambo, who was Minister of Law under Alphonso, as their leader.
Since the Revolution, the group &#8220;Accio Catalana&#8221; bourgeois, but advocate
of Catalonian Separatism has been organized. Its organ is the paper &#8220;La
Publicitat".
<p>To the left of the bourgeois groups are the petty-bourgeois groups now
flourishing since Alphonso&#8217;s exile. There is the &#8220;Partido Radical-Socialista&#8221; whose chief is Domingo and in Catalonia the group of Macia which takes
a separatist position and whose organ is &#8220;L&#8217; Opinio". Today it is the Radicals
and Radical-Socialists supported by the Socialists who dominate the government.
<p>We turn now to the Labor movement.There are two trade union centers
in Spain: 1. The Union General de Trabajo (U.G.T.) and the Confederacion
National de Trabajo (C.N.T.). The Union General de Trabajo (U.G.T.) has
already a half century of history behind it, having been organized in 1888
and having been the only organization of labor tolerated and permitted
by Alphonso and actually participating in the government under the King.
It is controlled by the reformist Socialist Party and today has about 250,000
to 300,000 members. Large Caballero, up to recently its head, is also now
the Minister of Labor of the Spanish Republic. It is particularly strong
in Madrid, in Biscay (in the metal and mining industry) and in the Asturias
(coal mining) although it is extremely weak in Catalonia, which after all,
is the labor and revolutionary center of the country. Besides its labor
members of the U.G.T. has a considerable peasant affiliation.
<p>The second labor center is the C.N.T. This organization, controlled
by Anarcho-Syndicalists and overwhelmingly strong in Catalonia (Barcelona
especially) whose metal, textile and general proletariat comprise the vanguard
of Spanish labor, is an extremely important revolutionary instrument. It
was organized in 1911 and during the revolutionary wave of 1919 under the
secretaryship of Andres Nin (now Trotskyist) the C.N.T. reached the enormous
membership of almost 1,000,000 members. It was due to this threat of the
proletariat that Alphonso XIII established the military dictatorship of
Primo de Rivera under whose ruthless blows in 1923 the unions were smashed.
The dictatorship of Primo de Rivera saw the virtual annihilation of the
C.N.T.
<p>With the new revolutionary wave that arose in 1929-1930 and that resulted
in Rivera&#8217;s downfall the C.N.T. rapidly reorganized itself and soon regained
its strength of a million members. As we have seen it has launched time
and again extremely powerful and violent general strikes throughout the
country, many of them, due to the Anarcho-Syndicalists leadership, of an
adventurous and wearying character. As a result of this false line, of
late the C.N.T. has lost its membership steadily so that in 1932 toward
the end of the year it had not much more than 400,000 workers.
<p>The C.N.T. is controlled by a so-called Federation of Iberian Anarchists
(F.I.A.). The false adventurist utopian direction which the F.I.A. has
given to the unions has resulted in a split, another &#8220;Group of 30&#8221; headed
by Pestanya arising. If the Anarchists think of political action and want
to smash the state by a conspiracy supported by the unions, the Pestanya
group stands against revolution and wants the syndicates to be pure and
simple economic organizations fighting for everyday reforms only. This
group declares it stands for a &#8220;practicable view&#8221; of the role of the trade
unions in Spain. Between these two groups then there goes on a struggle
which bids fair to convulse the whole C.N.T.
<p>However, the C.N.T. is still the most powerful revolutionary organization
in Spain. It issues two daily papers: &#8220;Solidaridad Obrera&#8221; put out in Barcelona
and &#8220;C.N.T.&#8221; published in Madrid. In its structure the C.N.T. stands as
a sort of cross between French Syndicalism and the I.W.W. Gradually it
is outgrowing its earlier Anarchist theory in the course of the Revolution.
Its local unions are now industrial and not close to the local trade union
centers. In 1919 these local centers had a great deal of autonomy but the
Trade Union Congress in 1931 in Madrid definitely declared for the formation
of National Centralized Industrial unions and a centralized national general
center. Thus more and more a Communist ideology is taking hold in the C.N.T.,
an ideology stimulated by the work of the Spanish Left Opposition and supported
by the fact that the mass of members are not skilled craftsmen but the
bulk of miserably exploited unskilled proletarians.
<p>To this report we must add that in June 1932 a new trade union center
was organized by the Communist Party of Spain. This is a direct result
of the sterile disloyal policy of Stalin. The history of this new trade
union center which now has the name of the Trade Union Unity Committee,
is briefly as follows: It must be recalled that during the dictatorship
of Primo de Rivera the C.N.T. had practically disappeared. Under Berenguer
it already began rapidly to revive. At that time the C.P. had organized
a &#8220;Committee of Reconstruction&#8221; to reconstruct the C.N.T. and used the
trade unions of Seville as a base. But already the C.N.T. had been thoroughly
reorganized so that the Seville actions were really acts of schism, splitting
the C.N.T. and drawing the fire of the workers on that account. Originally
it was a method of the Party to penetrate into the C.N.T.
<p>However, in 1931 the &#8220;new turn&#8221; of the Comintern hit Spain and the Communist
Party transformed the Committee of Reconstruction to a &#8220;Unity Committee".
The Communist Party claimed it had 700,000 workers behind it. Really it
had but 80,000. To the conference in 1932 only small unions in the provinces
and the trade unions of Seville responded. The tobacco and commercial workers
of Madrid came as observers only and withdrew. When we consider that after
the Revolution at times 85% of the Spanish proletariat were organized in
the C.N.T. and U.G.T. we can appreciate better the correctness of the Stalinists
line of breaking up the old unions. The weekly paper of the &#8220;Trade Union
Unity Committee&#8221; called &#8220;Unidad Syndicale&#8221; has become the symbol of the
new splitting policy of the C.I.
<p>We turn now from the trade union organizations of the working class
to their political organizations. First, the Socialist Party. The S.P.
has between 15,000 to 20,000 members at an estimate. It is strong in places
where its unions are strong and besides in Andalusia and Castille where
it has peasant connections. In Catalonia the separate Socialist Party which
had existed there and which had its own paper &#8220;Justitia Sociale&#8221; has now
fused with the Spanish Socialist Party. As we have seen the Socialist Party
supports the bourgeois regime, refuses to take power, but is part of a
ministerial coalition in which it has received the ministries of Labor,
Public Instruction and Public Works.
<p>Between the Socialists and the Communists and nearer to the Socialists
stands the Maurin Group, all of whose original membership came from the
Communist Party but split in 1930 when about 500-600 followed Maurin. This
group is strong only in Catalonia and there more in the province than in
the city of Barcelona proper.
<p>After the split Maurin formed an Iberian Communist Federation with about
1,000 membership and a weekly paper &#8220;La Batalla". In 1930 it was able to
get the &#8220;Communist Party of Catalonia&#8221; a separate and rationalist Communist
Party to fuse with it and thus strengthened itself. In 1931 the Iberian
Communist Federation organized a so-called &#8220;Workers-Peasants Bloc&#8221; a loose
organization which now has close to 5,000 members (1,000 in Barcelona).
The Maurin group is a typical nationalist centrist body losing more and
more of its character as a Communist organization.
<p>Before the Revolution, the Communist Party had about 2,000 members which
were not well organized. Now it has about 5,000 until very recently headed
by Bullejos and Trilla. As we have reported in the last issue of Class
Struggle (see Volume II no. 10-11) suddenly the whole Political Committee
of the Spanish Communist Party has been expelled including Bullejos and
Trilla, as &#8220;traitors".&#8212;TRAITORS no less! The Communist Party puts out
two weekly papers: &#8220;Frente Rojo&#8221; issued in Madrid with about 2,000 circulation
and &#8220;Las Masas&#8221; published in Barcelona and having 5000-6000 circulation.
The Communist Party also publishes irregularly a theoretical organ &#8220;Bolshevismo".
This is put out mainly as a counter to the theoretical organ of the Spanish
Left Opposition &#8220;Comunismo".
<p>As for the Left Opposition in Spain we can do no better than quote from
our article in Vol II no. 9 of the Class Struggle entitled: &#8220;A Report on
the European Sections of the International Left Opposition".
<p>&#8220;The first conference of the Spanish Left Opposition was held in Luxemburg
in 1929 with La Croix and five other members present. In 1930 another conference
was held this time in Madrid with about the same number of people (Nin,
La Croix, Andrade, Ferson) but it was only in the earlier part of 1931
that the Left Opposition really began to grow. The recent conference held
in April 1932 with 25 delegates represented over 1100 members. Within a
year it has put out a paper &#8220;El Soviet&#8221; now struggling to become a weekly,
with 5,000 circulation. It has issued a theoretical organ, &#8220;Comunismo&#8221; with 1500 circulation and over 15 popular pamphlets have been printed with
a large sale. A youth paper &#8220;Young Spartacus&#8221; has recently appeared which
it it claimed sells 2,000 copies. In quality the Left Opposition is stronger
than the Party (though not numerically, the Party having about 5,000 members)
and in many places the Left Opposition has groups where the Party has not
(as in Salamanca).The last conference found the Left Opposition best developed
in Biscay, Asturias, Castille, Andalusia, (Seville, Cadiz) Barcelona and
Madrid. (However, the group in Barcelona is numerically relatively small,
considering the importance of the place).
<p>&#8220;The last conference of the Left Opposition accomplished a good deal
and worked out elaborate theses on the situation in Spain, the position
of the Left Opposition on the national and agrarian questions, their relation
to the Party and to the syndicalists and on the trade union question. Within
the Left Opposition differences are arising as to the correctness of the
Spanish comrades but two things stand out clearly: 1. The great growth
of the Spanish Left Opposition due to its bold independent working class
activity. 2. The recogition it has received as the most dangerous revolutionary
force in Spain. In Catalonia only the Left Opposition is illegal (the Communist
Party is legal there) and the Chief of Police in a special brochure has
declared that Spain must account it as a stroke of good fortune that the
Communist Party has ejected the Left Opposition and that the leaders of
the Left Opposition are not the head of the Party. (see Maurice Karl: Communism
in Spain pg.91)".
<p>What are the perspectives of the Revolution? It is very clear that after
the Sanjurjo defeat the Revolution has taken a new turn to the Left. It
is also very clear that the Revolution is at a crossroads, that the unstable
equilibrium which now exists cannot long endure. Either the triumph of
reaction or the dictatorship of the proletariat.
<p>But for the dictatorship of the proletariat there is needed a complete
transformation of the subjective element, the proletariat. In no country
in the world has the opportunist adventurist criminal blunders of the anarcho-syndicalists
become so decisive as in Spain. The Syndicalists know how to use the general
strike to defend the republic, that is the republican bourgeoisie, but
they do not know how to use it to break the bourgeois republic and to seize
power! By their ignorant blunders they know only how to play into the hands
of the reformist Socialists, to weary out the masses and to prepare the
way for Fascism.
<p>The legalist and bourgeois character of the Spanish Socialist Party
has become patent to all. Indeed Prieto its leader has declared the Socialist
Party does not want power in Spain as Spain is in no condition to have
Socialism. To help the bourgeoisie, to pave the road even for the return
of Alphonso, to defeat at all costs the victory of the working class, this
is the despicable role of the Socialists.
<p>As usual the crimes of the Socialist Party are matched by the blunders
of the Communist Party. The bureaucratic splits, the theory of democratic
dictatorship, the general bankruptcy and vulgarity of the Communist Party
has isolated it and rendered it impotent.
<p>Only the Left Opposition can lead the working class out of the impasse.
The works of L.D. Trotsky stand as a beacon light showing the way. The
Spanish Left Opposition has a glorious opportunity. Let us boldly use it
and it may be that the Left Opposition will yet lead the Second Soviet
State on to victory.
