Garfield Meets But Mayor And Judge Leave In Huff</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Baker Dignifies
His Court by Telling Organizers to Go to Hell and Wants Workers to Respect
Him</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a sweeping victory Friday night,
February 26<sup>th</sup> the City Council of Garfield was won to complete
support of the strikers, while Mayor Burke and Recorder Baker expressed
themselves in an open meeting as their enemies. Recorder Baker, the judge
who has been handing out sentences of thirty to ninety days for peaceful
picketing, was driven to flee from the room in hysterical rout, and Mayor
Burke proclaimed himself the Botany-owned hater of the worker that he is.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was upon the invitation of the
Garfield City Council that the delegation of strikers accompanied by organizer
Weisbord came down, expecting from the letter they had received, to meet
with a delegation of citizens from Passaic and Clifton and with representatives
of the mill owners in an effort to begin negotiations to settle the strike.
No mill owners or their representatives showed their faces; no delegation
from Passaic or Clifton appeared. What can the strikers conclude but that
they alone wish to settle the strike, that the mill owners are not sincere
in their professions of wishing to settle it.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Council Is Favorable</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Council took action upon this
letter of protest which Organizer Weisbord had previously directed to Mayor
Burke and to the Garfield Council. The letter had demanded that the Council
stop the police interfering with the orderly picketing of the strikers
and their right to peacefully assemble. The atmosphere of the meeting was
not at first very favorable. Mayor Burke, Captain Morrison, and Recorder
Baker, looming in the background, presented a wall of hostility. But Weisbord
showed that the picket line had been sent away from the gates of the mills
where alone it could keep scabs from entering, to picket dwelling houses
and even a cemetery several blocks from the mill. Detectives had been constantly
present whose sneers and even whose presence, with its implication of company
spying upon the workers, had cast an atmosphere of restrain and depression
over the strikers meetings.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Feeling the ground slipping from
beneath his feet, as the councilmen came round to support of the strikers,
Recorder Burke attempted a grand coup by producing a bulky Atlantic Reporter
and read lengthy definition of picketing. This councilman Quinlivan knocked
into a cocked hat by dryly stating that the definitions were all that pickets
"may&#8221; be prevented from doing various things; not that they must be.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Fat Mayor Blusters</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mayor Burke now plunged to the rescue
--- if the word plunged may be applied to a two hundred pound graft-fed
bellied official with a masterpiece of strategy. He produced an article
from the Young Worker, which devilish sheet he claimed had been circulated
at the strikers meetings. Strange to say, the assembly did not at flee
from the room in terror at hearing an expression of solidarity with the
working class of Russia. And furthermore, Organizer Weisbord proved that
he did not circulate the Young Worker, that it was simply given out at
the hall just as many other papers were.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a fury at his own impotence, Recorder
Burke then burst into a tirade against unknown outsiders coming in and
taking the people away from their true leaders, who, one would infer, are
such hysterical, unreasoning and hostile officials as himself. Losing control
of himself completely, he told Weisbord to go to hell, the quicker the
better, and fled from the room amid a clamor of boos and cries of derision.
"Three cheers for Weisbord,&#8221; the cry went up, thus emphasizing the victory
of the United Front Committee.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Judge Baker Warned</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So firmly were the councilmen won
over by this time that resolutions for the support of the strikers were
passed unanimously. The Council endorsed the seven demands of the workers;
it requested Mayor Burke to withdraw police and detectives from meeting
halls; called upon Recorder Baker to be more lenient in his sentences of
strikers; it voted to support the relief of the strikers, and to call a
conference with the Board of Education to take steps to establish free
lunch counters in the schools for the hungry children of the strikers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Yes, the Council was won for the
strikers. But at every step the fact was emphasized that the Council has
no power; can request, but the man who can act, who can hound the worker
with police on the line and in the meeting hall, who can order for them
such brutal clubbings as the unforgettable affair of Ackerman&#8217;s bridge
is the man who draws pay as a secretary from the Botany Mill, the man who
has been a worker, but who has lived to betray his class&#8212;Mayor Burke.
And Mayor Burke shouted in a meeting packed with strikers that he would
have police in halls no matter what was requested. The last blow has been
dealt to whatever faith the strikers, citizens of Garfield may once have
had for their officials.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Stand Firm</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The bosses are twisting and squealing.
They do not know what to do. They are almost at the end of their bag of
tricks. They have tried to fool the workers into going back to work but
have failed miserably. The mills have closed down as tight as ever. In
fact more mills such as the Dundee Textile Mills are being forced to close
down more and more.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In desperation the bosses are trying
terrorism and violence. They are getting the police to try to close down
our halls and to break up our picket lines and to club innocent workers
and citizens. But the answer of the workers will be stand firmer than ever.
We will not be provoked into violence but we shall not yield one inch where
we are right. We shall answer the clubs of policemen with firmness in self
defense, with publicity, with photographs.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Stand firm, workers, stand firm.
We have plenty of money to care for all the needy ones. A new relief store
has now been opened for the East side workers at 85 Passaic Street for
the workers of the Passaic Worsted Spinning Co. Mill. Gera Mill and New
Jersey Spinning Co. Mill. This is our answer to the drive of the bosses
to get new scabs.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Stand firm, workers, stand firm.
The bosses are yielding all along the line. They are growing weaker and
weaker. The bosses must crack soon. Do not be scared and stampeded. We
must win. Our cause is just and righteous. We shall win.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Let the Facts Speak</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are two important elements
in the strike at present:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1. The resulting to tear bombs, the
water hose and Cossacks. It is estimated by all decent and civilized people
that this is the lowest form of attack that can be used. Only the most
depraved of officials and only the most bigoted of tyrants would think
of using such methods. Yet we have them here in Passaic.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These tactics against starving and
ill-clad workers will remain a blot on the city for all time, and those
responsible will be looked on as the vilest of the breed of human oppressors.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. The impeachment of the commissioner
of public safety, Abram Preiskel.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While it is true that behind Preiskel
is Mayor McGuire and behind the mayor are the mill owners, the dirty work
is done by the commissioner. He seems to be a willing tool. Were he very
much of a man he would refuse to be such a tool.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In righteous indignation not only
the workers, but the entire populace has risen to protest and to call for
the impeachment of this unworthy official. The people of this city can
get along very well without the kind of &#8220;safety&#8221; he is giving them. The
strikers have been orderly. They will remain orderly. The only violence
has come from the officials.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Speaker at mass meeting: &#8220;Judge Baker
says that the sooner Weisbord gets out of town the better he likes it.
Do you want Weisbord to leave town?&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Audience: with a loud voice: &#8220;No!&#8221;</font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Speaker: &#8220;Whom do you want to get
out?&#8221;</font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Audience: &#8220;Baker.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Is it specified in the oath of office
that the Mayor shall know absolutely nothing? If so he is living up to
his oath like a gentleman and a scholar.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All who want to go back to work first
and settle the strike after, say Aye. The No&#8217;s have it.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Impeach Preiskel</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To the Mayor and Commissioner of
Passaic:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We the citizens of Passaic protest
most emphatically against the Cossack outrages which our police department
and officials of Passaic have committed.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We demand that the clubbing and trampling
down of innocent men and women be stopped.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We demand the removal of the mounted
police.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We demand the impeachment of Abram
Preiskel, Commissioner of Public Safety, who is responsible for all the
disorders in this city.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The letter from Dr. Wise and his
committee is as follows:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">New York City, N. Y.</font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman,Times">March 5, 1926.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To the Strikers in the Textile Industries
of Passaic, Men and Women:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We, the residents of the metropolitan
industrial district centering in New York, have learned of your refusal
to remain at work in the mills of Passaic under the conditions of a wage
reduction imposed upon you some months ago. We know of the demands that
have been made by you upon the mill owners and we believe these demands
to be just and righteous. We have been deeply grieved to note the ruthlessness
with which you have been treated by the police of your city, and we regret
this the more because many of you are not yet become American citizens
or are American citizens of recent adoption who should never have made
to suffer nor even to look upon any violation of the rights of citizenship
in this country.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is our understanding that the
mill owners have refused up to this time to negotiate with you on the ground,
real or alleged, that you are not regularly organized within the ranks
of labor, and that your leader is a man of radical political views. As
for the latter allegation, we have learned after careful investigation
that, whatever his political views may be, he has scrupulously avoided
the injection of them into the situation in which you find yourselves under
his leadership. It has further been brought to our notice that some representatives
and managers of the mills have declared that they would have been prepared
to negotiate with representatives of the American Federation of Labor,
if these had undertaken negotiations on your behalf. The truth is, as we
know it, that the mill owners of Passaic have been steadily and even bitterly
opposed to the organization of their workers under any auspices or name
whatsoever. This it is that has done most to make impossible your organization
within the ranks of the United Textile Workers which body would, as it
ought now to, have organized the workers of Passaic in the textile industry,
had it not yielded to the relentless opposition of the establishments in
which you labor.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We address ourselves to you in order
to offer the following proposal:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are prepared if you desire it,
to serve as a body of your representatives who shall negotiate on your
behalf with the owners and managers of the establishments in which you
have been employed. We are prepared to urge the acceptance of the demands
made by you, and to submit the results of our negotiations to you and your
General Strike Committee before the final acceptance thereof.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We offer this proposal to you because
we are in entire sympathy with you in your grievances and in your hope
of redress. We believe that it is given to us to render a public service
of importance in serving as your representatives in these negotiations
which we are prepared to offer to initiate in the event of your acceptance
of our offer.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Very faithfully yours,</font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman,Times">John Lovejoy Elliott, Paul U. Kellogg,
John Howard Melish, Stephen S. Wise.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In reply a letter was sent by the
United Front Committee to Dr. Stephen S. Wise, John Lovejoy Elliott, Paul
U. Kellogg, and the Rev. John Howard Melish.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The General Strike Committee of the
United Front Committee of Textile Workers appreciates the fact that you
are in full sympathy with the demands of the strikers and are prepared
to bring about a settlement of the controversy on the basis of these demands.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The General Strike Committee accepts
your offer to work for a satisfactory settlement and wishes to point out
that it has always been ready to meet with the representatives of the mill
owners for that purpose. However, it has been the obstinacy of the mill
owners, their refusal to meet with the regular representatives of the workers
for no valid reasons whatsoever, that has now placed the entire responsibility
for the continuance of the strike fully and plainly upon the shoulders
of the mill owners.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We furthermore desire to express
to you our complete satisfaction with the position you have taken to submit
the results of your efforts to the General Strike Committee for approval
before final settlement is made. The General Strike Committee of the United
Front Committee of Textile Workers reserves for itself the right of reaching
final decision on the issues in controversy and it is upon this basis only
that the General Strike Committee accepts your sincere offer to intercede
in our behalf.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We trust that your efforts, motivated
as they are by the highest public feelings and calculated to render a public
service of importance, will culminate in a satisfactory termination of
the strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Very respectfully yours,</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Governor&#8217;s Offer</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are glad to note that Gov. Moore
has offered his services to mediate the textile strike in Passaic.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The United Front Committee of Textile
Workers of Passaic and vicinity has always been ready to meet the representatives
of the mill owners to reach a satisfactory settlement, although those representatives
have consistently refused for no valid reasons whatsoever to deal with
the workers organization.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our organization is ready to meet
the mill owners of Passaic or their representatives at any conference that
Governor Moore may call.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In commenting on the letter, Mr.
Weisbord said: &#8220;The offer of the committee of which Dr. Wise is a member
is very kindly in view of the offer of Governor Moore to mediate the strike.
The mill owners can no longer refuse Governor Moore&#8217;s offer of mediation
when such a powerful committee as that headed by Dr. Wise offers to be
the mouthpiece of the strikers in the settlement talk. It should be noted
that the statement of the committee headed by Dr. Wise contains the following
important points, (1) that the demands of the strikers are considered fully
just and righteous. (2) That the cry of Communism is only a bogy conceived
by hysterical mill owners themselves. (3) That the argument of the owners
that they would meet the American Federation of Labor but not the United
Front Committee is a specious and insincere one to quote the letter, &#8216;The
truth is, as we know it, that the mill owners of Passaic have been steadily,
and even bitterly opposed to the organization of their workers under any
auspices or name whatsoever. This it is that has done most to make impossible
your organization within the ranks of United Textile Workers, which body
would, as it ought now to do, have organized the workers of Passaic in
the textile industry, had it not yielded to the relentless opposition of
the establishments in which you labor.&#8217; Our reply to this communication
takes great pain to point out that the United Front Committee of course
considers itself to be the final body in deciding on what conditions the
workers shall go back to the mills.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Committee also announced that
it would be ready to meet the mill owners of Passaic at any conference
which Governor Moore might call in discussing his offer to act as mediator
for the strike.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thirteen clergyman of Passaic and
neighboring towns met with Organizer Albert Weisbord at the headquarters
of the United Front Committee of Textile Workers Friday morning at 10:30
and after a short talk by Weisbord the clergyman asked many questions concerning
the strike situation.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After a long discussion a motion
was made by J. Wroblewski that a committee of three be elected from those
present to be sent to both sides in an effort to bring about a mutual conference
between the employers and the strikers. The motion was seconded by T. Andrews
and then carried.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The committee elected were the following:
Rev. E. F. Schulte, Chairman, Rev. John Wroblewski, and Rev. T. Andrews.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As soon as they succeed in getting
the bosses to agree to meet the strikers and their representatives the

In The Ranks</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first break in the ranks of the
bosses came on March 1, when officials of the Passaic Worsted and Spinning
Company sent their spokesman to negotiate with the United Front Committee
of Textile Workers and its Organizer, Albert Weisbord, conducting the strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The spokesman agreed to two of the
demands made by the Union: Better sanitary conditions and time and a half
for overtime. The important point is that for the first time the Committee
and its official representative, Albert Weisbord, was recognized.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"No family in need of food has been
turned away from the relief committee without aid.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is the most important statement
that has been issued since the beginning of the strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is easy enough to call a strike
and to ask the workers to take up a fight against the bosses when the conditions
become unendurable. But to have a plan for relief that will be adequate
is often neglected.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The United Front Committee of Textile
Workers looked ahead and put its machinery to work as soon as the strike
started. It was known that workers who resort to the hardship of a strike
have not been getting wages that would permit them to lay aside a big bank
account. Most of them were not three weeks ahead of starvation.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The relief department was started
at once. Funds began to see there would be enough to meet all needs. The
unions have responded gloriously and many sympathizers have given of their
bounty.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Organizer Weisbord announced at the
meetings that three stores are now giving food supplies. One store has
just opened at Monroe and Dayton Ave. where clothing is furnished.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At present over 1,500 families are
cared for every day. There will be more right along. There are over 12,000
workers on strike in Passaic and vicinity. Now Lodi is added with another
4,000. The Belting and Rubber plants are getting restless. Other underpaid
workers will not be able to hold out very long. All these must be taken
care of.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">They <b><em>will</em></b> be taken
care of. The answer to the brutal bosses is adequate relief. The bosses
shall not starve the workers back. There are 40,000,000 workers in America
who will answer the bosses with funds for the strikers. It is a <b><em>powerful</em></b>
answer. It is the <b><em>most powerful</em></b> answer. <b><em>The bosses
shall not starve the workers back.</em></b></font>

by John Lovejoy Elliott, Paul U. Kellogg, John Howard Melish, and Stephen
S. Wise, famous clergyman and leaders, that has prejudiced Colonel Johnson
against them as spokesmen for the strikers?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Certain it is that up until now,
the offer of Rabbi Wise, motivated by the highest public feelings, has
been totally ignored. Surely the mill owners cannot fail to listen to so
powerful a committee as that headed by Rabbi Wise. If they still refuse
to meet the workers, we point out that the further continuance of the strike
will rest fully and plainly on their shoulders&#8221; Mr. Weisbord has said.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The week has passed. The Botany mill
is the only one that has even replied to the invitation of Rabbi Wise,
and Colonel Johnson has refused to treat with him. All the other mills
have kept silent. Can they keep silent forever?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One dent has been made in the stubborn
effort of the mill owners to kill the union by refusing to negotiate with
it. On March first the officials of the Passaic Worsted and Spinning Company
met the United Front Committee and its Organizer, Albert Weisbord and acceded
to two demands of the workers. The importance of this conference lay, not
in the demands that were agreed to, but in the fact that for the first
time, a mill in Passaic recognized the right of the workers to have a union
and met with that union for negotiation. This is only the first tiny rift
that indicates the huge crack that the mills must suffer. More mills will
come out and every mill will deal with the United Front Committee in the
formation of &#8220;one big textile union.&#8221;</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Amalgamation! One
Union in the Textile Industry!</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One of the most important purposes
of the United Front Committee of Textile Workers is the formation one industrial
union in the textile industry.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What do we find today? We find almost
a dozen small unions, each one weak and incapable of organizing the great
mass of the unskilled textile workers. Sometimes these unions even fight
each other and play right into the hands of the employers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The United Front Committee will move
with the greatest vigor and determination to change this situation and
will support every honest move for amalgamating all of the textile unions
into one.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Last Sunday the Executive Board of
the Federated Textile Unions, a body composed of five textile unions, met
and decided to call an amalgamation conference for the first Saturday in
June at the Imperial Hotel, New York City, to which all representatives
of all textile organizations are invited.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of course the United Front Committee,
on whose initiative this conference was called, will send delegates. Let
us hope that the Associated Silk Workers in Paterson will come in also
and then we will have made a great step toward labor unity in the textile
industry in America.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This move toward amalgamation is
doubly important for us in Passaic, for it means that the powerful Federated
Textile Unions will support the moves made by the United Front Committee
in organizing the unorganized.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And this move for amalgamation comes
just at the proper time. It comes when the United Front Committee is conducting
a tremendous fight in Passaic. It comes when the Associated Silk Workers
are moving toward strike action in Paterson. It comes when all of the Lawrence
textile workers may walk out under leadership of the United Front Committee.
It comes when organization moves are being made in Providence R. I., and
Philadelphia Pa. It comes at a time when the whole textile industry may
soon be aflame.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This revolt of the workers in the
textile industry must not be allowed to go off in thin air. The revolt
that will break out in strikes must be taken in hand by a powerful textile
union so that at last the textile workers of this country may have a permanent,
enduring industrial union.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Who Is Col. Charles
F. H. Johnson?</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Col. Charles F. H. Johnson is the
Vice-president of the Botany Worsted Mills. He is also the representative
of the bosses to settle the strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Col. Johnson was a poor boy when
he grew up. His father was a policeman in New York and his mother ran an
employment agency. Neither job can be considered to have had a good influence
on the youth. He is not to blame for the environment that molded his mind
in his earlier days.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fabien, as he was called, set out
to make his way early and got jobs of various kinds that landed him in
the insurance and real estate business. Then he got into the mills and
was &#8220;promoted.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now he is vice-president of this
big mill. He is against the workers. He did not earn his way up. He made
the workers earn it for him. He tells you that there is a chance for everyone.
That is not so.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are over 5,000 workers in the
Botany. Can each one become vice-president of the mill? If they succeed,
who will work in the mill? If they get another set of workers, will not
they also go on strike? And then if they &#8220;work themselves up&#8221; will the
10,000 vice-presidents hire another 5,000 to do the work? And those too
"work themselves up&#8221; and another 5,000 shipped in?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No fool but a rich fool would argue
in this manner, that is the way the bosses try to deceive the workers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But that is not all. When the workers
are trying to &#8220;work themselves up&#8221; by asking for higher wages, Col. Johnson
does not seem to agree with them.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">How does he want them to &#8220;work their
way up?&#8221; Will he not please tell them? He might be able to solve the problem
quite quickly.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Col. Johnson, please, Col. Johnson,
tell us 5,000 Botany workers how to &#8220;work our way up.&#8221; Please do that.
Just tell us how we may become vice-president of the Botany or some other
mills, with nice little incomes of any amount between $5,000 and $5,000,000
a year.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you will do that we will quit
the strike at once. And after you have shown us how to do it, will you
not go up to Lawrence, Mass., and let the 25,000 mill slaves there in on
the secret? Then go to Paterson and slip the joyful information into the
ears of the silk workers. They will at once stop talking about the strike
that is brewing in Paterson.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Oh, Col. Johnson, what a nice man
you would be if you would only tell us this little thing. It is so easy
for you and it would be so good for us. Just tell us how to &#8220;work our way
up&#8221; so we get an income of anything from $5000 to $5000,000 a year, ---
without working for it&#8212;just like the bosses.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The Bosses Are Weeping</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Pity the poor bosses. They are weeping.
Dear me! Maybe we can do something for them.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">They are now running half page advertisements
in the daily papers saying that they are poverty stricken and on the threshold
of the poor house.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Botany wails that it made $156,000
less last year than in 1914. But it very conveniently omits to tell us
how much it made in 1914. It was the beginning of the war when the profiteers
were in clover.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Bulletin happens to know that
during the last three years the Botany has made over $6,000,000 in profits.
It has loaned $2,000,000 to German mills and is drawing interest on that.
It may be hard for the bosses and their little wives and poodle doggies
to live on the paltry $4,000,000 they have left. Maybe we should take up
a collection for them.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Botany also states that it paid
$3,706,000 more in wages last year than in 1914. Why not if it had a larger
working force than twelve years ago?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But what we would like to have the
Botany state frankly is this: How many did you employ in 1914? What was
the average wage? How many did you employ in 1925? What was the average
wage? How much did you get a yard in 1914? How much did you get a yard
1925?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have asked you to open your books.
You have refused. It will do you little good to spend on advertisements
if you do not want to give the facts. You will not be able to fool the
workers with the stuff you have published so far.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the first place your stuff can
be picked to shreds. It is too flimsy. There is too much hypocrisy in it.
You are playing like the boy who looks through his fingers and pulls the
kitten by the tail at the same time. The workers see through you. The Bulletin
is here and that is somewhat annoying to you. It shows what little squealers
you are and how you try to scheme the workers back into the shops.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then, too, you do not get to the
workers with your stuff. They do not buy the papers you advertise in. Why
should they? A few dozen will read those sheets. But most of the town reads
the Bulletin. All the strikers read the Bulletin. That makes a big difference.
And they will not go back to work just because you tell them your sob story.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Besides it does not look very good
for full grown men to cry and sob like that. You look just like Shakespeare&#8217;s
"sick girl". What would you say about the men and women you pay $12 to
$18 a week if they bellered around like that? They have braced up and gone
out to tell the world that they cannot live on the miserable wages you
pay them. And the world is listening to them and agrees with them!</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But you? The whole world holds you
in supreme contempt.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The Strike At Lodi</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The workers at Lodi have joined the
strikers of the Passaic district. Many of them came out when 6,000 fellow
workers marched from Passaic through Garfield and Clifton and down the
road to the United Piece Dye Works in Lodi. It was a day not soon to be
forgotten.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But it was not the line of 6,000
that pulled the Lodi workers out. It was the horrible conditions that prevail
in those dye works and the starvation wages that have been paid.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is not easy for a group of workers
to decide upon a strike. The strike is the last weapon they will use against
the bosses. Only when the wages have been cut so low that it is impossible
to live, and when the work hours and the conditions become so terrible
that death itself loses its terrifying power that the workers will take
the risk of walking out, not knowing where even to get the crumbs that
a starvation wage afforded.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The bosses of the Dye works have
been as brutal as any in the textile industry. They exploited immigrant
labor to the very limit. So hard were they that even the most needy could
not endure the oppression. The bosses could not get enough labor to run
the dye works.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then they resorted to other means.
They went south and brought Negroes with them. They went further south
and imported Mexicans. They thought this would save them. The new recruits
in the Lodi slave pen have gone out with the rest of the workers. Negroes
and Mexicans have joined all the other workers and united with them in
the great protest against the tyrants.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Out of the steamy, damp and fuming
rooms they have come. Out of the killing air of chemicals and poisonous
vapors they come. From the hall of slavery and tyranny, of low wages and
deadly speed up pace, of long hours and smelling, unsanitary pits they
come. All call for a chance to live. All pledges themselves to stand together.
All sing &#8220;Solidarity Forever!&#8221; All are workers and all must unite through
which they may gain now into a powerful organization and decent wages and
more human conditions.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The United Front Committee of Textile
Workers welcome the workers of Lodi into the ranks of the militant workers
of Passaic, Garfield and Clifton. Together we will become strong. Through
our own union we will be powerful. If we stick together we will win in
this battle and gain for ourselves and our children improved conditions
and a greater measure of the things that we justly ask for and must have
in life.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Prussianized System of Factory Operation
is Repugnant to American Industrial Standards"&#8212;Committee Says</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Accompanied by a delegation of men
and women strikers representative of about 16,000 workers now out on protest
against a 10 per cent wage cut arbitrarily ordered by the large New Jersey
textile mills, Honorable Frank P. Walsh, former Joint Chairman of the National
War Labor Board and chairman of the federal Commission on Industrial Relations
created under the administration of President Taft, yesterday laid before
Senators Borah, LaFollete and Wheeler and other influential members of
both the Senate Committee on Education and Labor and the Committee on Manufactures,
evidence supporting his demand for a special congressional inquiry into
denial of constitutional rights and interference with interstate commerce
by the New Jersey mill owners.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a statement issued to the press
this evening, Mr. Walsh laid down the following grounds to warrant immediate
congressional action:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Condition Is Anti-Social</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A committee representing the textile
workers of Passaic, N. J. and vicinity has laid before me facts showing
that more than 90 per cent of the employees of this basic interstate industry
are unable to earn a living wage, according to the bulletins of the U.S.
Department of Labor. Such a condition is admittedly anti-social and un-American,
and calls for the interposition of all available arms of the government
to end its existence. Any industry which refuses to pay its workers a living
wage should be declared a public nuisance, and if it be an essential industry,
it should be taken over and operated directly by the government.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I have come to Washington with these
textile mill workers to bring to the attention of responsible members of
the Senate, a state of affairs in the New Jersey textile industry which
the evidence proves to be more disgraceful and inhuman than I have ever
found to exist in any other industry of this country. It is my hope that
the U.S. Senate will take prompt and vigorous action to investigate the
truth of these charges, and hold criminally responsible those industrial
interests responsible for violating the constitutional rights of their
employees.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Brutal Police Assaults</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We base our request for Congressional
action on the following charges, which will be made under oath by a large
number of eyewitnesses:</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">The rights of public assemblage, free
speech, and free press are being denied by the public officials of the
mill towns, as evidenced by scores of brutal assaults on peaceable workers,
newspaper representatives, and the public by police and other officials.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Governmental protection of the life,
limb, and homes of the great majority of the inhabitants of these mill
towns has broken down, imperiling and destroying the life, liberty and
property of vast numbers of citizens of New Jersey by force and violence,
in direct violation of the federal Constitution.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">The textile industry of New Jersey,
primarily engaged in production for outer state and foreign commerce, compels
workers to produce its goods amid sanitary conditions that menace their
own health and that of the persons of the various states into which their
product is shipped by interstate commerce.</font></li></p>

<p><br /><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Spies and Thugs Used</font>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">The New Jersey mill owners are using
interstate transportation to bring into Passaic and vicinity spies and
detectives to act as agents provocateurs and to initiate and foster violence
and intimidation.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">The mill owners are threatening to use
the federal immigration laws to initiate deportation proceedings against
hundreds of law-abiding workmen for no other reason than that they insist
on a living wage and working conditions which are not a menace to life
and limb.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">The public officials of these mill towns
have been bribed by the mill owners, and peace officers arbitrarily refuse
to enforce the statutes and ordinances of the State for the protection
of United States citizens.</font></li></p>

<p><br /><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Guarantees Violated By Authorities</font>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Both the Congress and the President
are called on to enforce Article IV Section 4 of the Constitution of the
United States, guaranteeing to each State of the Union a republican form
of government and protection against invasion, which constitutional guarantees
are now being violated with impunity in the State of New Jersey.</font></li>
</ol>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Frank P. Walsh and the delegation
of Passaic strikers brought with them a mass of evidence showing the large
profits of the wage-cutting mills, the brutality of the police, the viciousness
of municipal authorities and the refusal of the courts to administer impartial
justice, together with evidence showing unsanitary and illegal working
conditions, excessive hours of labor, forced speeding up of workers, night
work for mothers, and the poverty and illiteracy of thousands of workers
compelled to exist on starvation wages.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Walsh emphasized the willingness
of the strikers and the refusal of the mill owners to negotiate, despite
the endeavors of local churches and merchants and the appeals of such disinterested
public leaders as Gov. A. H. Moore of New Jersey, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise,
John Lovejoy Elliott, John Howard Melish, Paul U. Kellogg and many others.
It is expected that a resolution for the immediate appointment of a special
committee of investigation into the New Jersey situation will be introduced
into the Senate in a day or two.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sir:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Following our conference of this
afternoon, and summarizing the suggestions and counter-suggestions thereof,
we submit the following:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are now on strike in the textile
manufactories of Passaic, N. J. and vicinity approximately 16,000 workers,
men, women and children. The strike began on the 25<sup>th</sup> day of
January of the present year. The undersigned committee of workers, all
of whom waited upon you, is composed of textile workers actually employed
in the mills at the time of the strike, and who went on the strike in an
effort to remedy intolerable conditions. Before going on the strike, the
employees, through committees democratically selected, presented their
demands as follows:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For the Woolen and Worsted Mill Workers</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Abolition of the 10 per cent wage cut
and 10 per cent increase in wages;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">The return of money taken from the workers
since the time of the last wage cut;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">The forty-four hour week;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Time and one half pay for overtime work;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Decent and sanitary working conditions;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">No discrimination against union workers;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Recognition of the workers union.</font></li>
</ol>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">For the Silk Workers</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">A 25 per cent increase in wages;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">The forty-four hour week;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Time and one half pay for overtime work;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Decent and sanitary working conditions;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">No discrimination against union workers;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Recognition of the workers union.</font></li>
</ol>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">The employing mill owners made no reply
to these demands. The Botany mills, the largest of the group, summarily
discharged each and every member of the employees committee which had presented
the claims of the workers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Answering your request as to terms
under which the controversy might be settled, we respectfully submit the
following:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Living Wage Demanded</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">That a living wage for all employees
be immediately established as a minimum in all mills now on strike, the
amount of such living wage to be that which has heretofore been determined
by the United States Department of Labor itself, said living wage to be
retroactive to the time of the wage cut of October, 1925.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">That immediately upon the establishment
of such minimum living wage, the employees will return to work in the mills.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Union Must Be Recognized</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">That within three days following the
establishment of said minimum living wage, the mill management and the
undersigned committee, representing the striking workers, shall each select
one representative to adjust the demands herein set forth. The employers
shall have the right to select an officer, stockholder, or person unconnected
with the mills, and the workers shall likewise have the right to select
one of their number or a person unconnected with the mills to represent
them, so that the principle of collective bargaining through representatives
freely selected may be preserved. These two representatives shall be empowered
to adjust all points in dispute between the mill owners and the workers,
and in case of disagreement shall have the authority to select an impartial
referee to the end that any remaining disputed points may be equitably
adjusted.</font></li>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The strike in Passaic came to Washington
like an invasion. The workers from Passaic, representing 16,000 strikers,
saw more of the working of the Government in two days than most workers
ever will know. It is a story of highest importance to them. They went
from the senatorial offices to the White House. From there they went to

in the dignified Senatorial offices, it sounded different. It sounded monstrous.
It seemed unbelievable. Told there in Washington, the simple facts painted
Passaic as a hell hole. No one can hear the lives of the textile workers
without horrors.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Walsh said: &#8220;Mr. Senator, the
leadership of this strike has been accused of holding radical political
views, but I tell you that in Passaic it is this wage scale that is menacing
the government<font size=-1> </font>of the United States.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As they told their story, these workers
from Passaic grew in significance. It was as if behind them was the disciplined
union army of the picket line&#8212;as if here in Washington represented
by them were the workers of the textile industry a million strong, saying
to the senate of the United States: &#8220;We want the people of the country
to know how the cloth they wear is made&#8212;the cloth they wear is being
paid for with our lives. Listen folks, everywhere, how cotton, wool and
silk cloth is made.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The little company which seemed so
small and which had the power of marching numbers behind it went the next
day to knock on the door of the White House. The door opened easily enough.
The door man let them into a stately office where they met the private
secretary, Sanders. It seemed it was impossible for the President to see
the strikers. &#8220;Does that mean,&#8221; Miss Wiley asked, &#8220;that the President will
never see us?&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Somewhat embarrassed, Secretary Sanders
admitted that this was true. The President would never see representatives
of the textile workers. Albert Weisbord said, &#8220;It seems strange that when
President Coolidge receives the Charleston dancers he cannot see the textile
workers.&#8221; It did seem strange.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It did seem strange&#8212;so strange
that newspapers all over the country took up Weisbord&#8217;s words. Workers
all over the country wonder why the President of the United States cannot
see the workers who wish to tell him about their unbearable grievances.
Mrs. Breznak wept bitterly. &#8220;The President of the United States wants four
more years of hell hole for us in Passaic,&#8221; she sobbed. How terrible it
seemed that the President didn&#8217;t care if they lived or died.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I had to smash my hankerchief so
I wouldn&#8217;t cry out aloud,&#8221; said Mrs. Janike. Don&#8217;t worry, Frances Janike,
though you cried quietly, the workers of the United States saw your tears
as you were turned out of the White House. Son&#8217;t worry Mrs. Breznak, the
President of the United States cannot help the hell holes of Passaic. It
is the workers in Passaic and the workers in the United States behind them
that will have to remedy that. In his own fashion the President may have
helped you. At the White House the workers were told that their place was
at the Department of Labor. The White House, it seems, has nothing to do
with the Workers grievances.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The committee sat in the room of
the Department of Labor, where the mill owners had been so short a while
before. You could smell them yet. Face them, Secretary Davis, his smooth,
waxen face, not the face of a worker but the face of an actor. He is always
talking about the time he was a peddler. He has the tools of his trade
--- nickel-plated. Like his tools, he too is plated, original material
coated over by vague phrases of a man who watches for the reflection of
his words on the faces of crowds, as a politician must. The large room,
with its great desk, its long shiny table is filled with the ghosts of
dead conferences. Here have come an endless file of employers to state
as did Johnson of the Botany Mills, that they would deal with the workers
individually.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The employers who were here yesterday
had put forward a plan of how to break the strike. Human life is not their
affair. Strike breaking is their business. First they wanted the workers
to go back and then they would settle.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A growl from the committee was their
answer. &#8220;We won&#8217;t go back first.&#8221; Mrs. Breznak gave Secretary Davis a piece
of her mind: &#8220;I done starve before I go back to work&#8212;they say they
give us what we want&#8212;we don&#8217;t get nothing&#8212;no Mister, I live on
black coffee and dry bread long enough.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The committee rejected the strike-breaking
plan as heartily as the full throated &#8220;no&#8221; of the workers in Passaic rejected
it. This is not my plan, says Mr. Davis. This is not our plan, says Mr.
Kerin. This is the best, the very best, terms we could get from the employers.
They speak as though they had performed an appendix operation to get these
terms from the employers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The committee next day made its counter-proposals.
"We reject completely the mill owners proposal to break the strike,&#8221; said
Mr. Walsh. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t put it that way,&#8221; said Mr. Kerin. &#8220;Many strikes
are settled by the workers going back to work first.&#8221; Take care Mr. Kerin,
the Department of Labor indirectly advised the striking textile workers

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The picket lines are not the only
places where the battles of the strike are being fought. They are being
fought in the jails and courts of New Jersey.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Jack Rubenstein fought the strike
battle when he went on a seventy-two hour hunger strike as a protest against
unjustified solitary confinement, a hunger strike that was only broken
by bail of $2,000. From Monday until Friday night the forces of the law
used every trick to keep the picket captain in jail. Six other strikers,
arrested at the East Paterson picket line were released on Thursday.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rubenstein was apparently arrested
solely because he was a picket leader. After his trial without the right
of a defense lawyer, he was sentenced to 60 days in jail on a disorderly
conduct charge, the disorder consisting in saying to the sheriff that he
wished to pass the National Silk Dye works with his pickets.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An argument between two prisoners,
in which he acted as mediator, was Jack&#8217;s undoing in the Hackensack jail.
He was pommelled by a keeper and although he did not attempt to defend
himself, was put into solitary confinement for &#8220;getting gay&#8221; with an officer.
He promptly went on a hunger strike as a protest against this new injustice,
and for seventy-two hours was without food.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One brief vacation of an hour broke
the long confinement when Jack officially released on bail of $1,000 and
was taken in handcuffs to the Justice of the Peace charged with &#8220;getting
gay&#8221; and sentenced to another 60 days. His release was affected by another
$2,000 bond and he was told that his bond would be doubled with any future
arrest.</font>

a New Crime by Letting a Cop Split His Head</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A new crime has been invented in
Passaic. If a striker allows a cop to split his head the striker has committed
a crime, and is at once taken to the hoosegow and later to the judge and
given a sentence of anywhere from 10 to 60 days in the county bull pen.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To prove this ask Chester Grabinsky.
He knows…….</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Grabinsky was picketing in a small
line of only half a dozen, among them a couple of boys that have worked
in the mills since they were 13. When the police stopped Teddy Timchko,
17 and began to search him, Grabinsky asked what right the police had to
search a young fellow on the picket line without any reason. He was at
once put under arrest. Then after he was in the hands of a cop, another
cop came along and shouted, &#8220;Where is that fellow?&#8221; When he saw him he
knocked him unconscious with his night stick.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Grabinsky&#8217;s head had been split and
he was bleeding profusely. The kind hearted chief who happened around ordered
Grabinsky locked up. The jailer saw his condition and ordered him sent
to the hospital. Here the doctors sewed up the scalp and got him dressed
for the next ordeal. He must now go to the court and see what has been
his crime. The judge gets the hang of the affair and promptly gives Grabinsky
ten days in jail, explaining that it is a serious crime to get hit by a
cop&#8217;s club.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Apologists for the judge claim that
he did this out of pure kindness and argue that it will require at least
ten days for the wound to be healed, and what place could be more safe
than the jail where no picket lines are formed and where cops do not break
in and split heads.</font>

Strikers Taken to Station as Truck Drivers Are Arrested.</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The bloodiest, most brutal assault
in a long series of outrages occurred on Thursday when the Clifton police
stopped an orderly picket line on the Ackerman bridge, cursed its leaders,
beat at least four men into insensibility, wounded scores of other strikers,
and clubbed and wounded many bystanders who were not in the picket lines.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The hideous scenes of the Ackerman
bridge in the early days of the strike, when women were beaten to the ground,
were re-enacted on Thursday. Sixty five strikers and by standers made sworn
statements Thursday relating the horrors of the afternoon. Three men lay
insensible on the sidewalk, side by side, while another man who had not
been in the picket line tried to staunch the blood from wounds in his face
that his glasses, broken by a policeman&#8217;s fist, has made.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An old man, coming out of a cellar
with a load of wood, was clubbed unconscious and thrust in a nearby doorway.
Slugging with fists and nightsticks of police, foul language used indiscriminately
by patrolman, detectives, and the chief of police, John Coughlin himself,
brutality piled upon outrages, all these things were sworn to in sixty
five affidavits made by witnesses within a few hours of the occurrence.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Unprovoked Attack
On Pickets</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was an unprovoked attack as could
be imagined. The picket line, three thousand strong, from three halls,
was marching quietly along in an effort to picket the gates of the Dundee
Silk mill. It was met by chief of police Coughlin who ordered the line
turned into Ackerman Ave. as the head of the line paused, the bridge became
jammed with a great mass of pickets coming up from behind. Through this
mob the police flung themselves, swinging night sticks and cursing. On
the close packed bridge it was nearly impossible to escape. Dozens of innocent
men and women were injured.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Those arrested on the usual charges
of &#8220;disorderly conduct&#8221; and &#8220;interfering with an officer in the performance
of his duty&#8221; were freed on bail of $250 each until their hearing. They
were Samuel Somala, William Romanik, Jacob Dodas, and Stephen Kopar.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The outrages at Ackerman bridge were
no sooner over than new ones were perpetrated by the Clifton police. Three
members of the Bakers Union, Local No. 100 of New York, who had come with
a group of men to bring four truck loads of bread were arrested with their
truck, and the bread held at the police station. Three other loads were
delivered. The men arrested on a charge of speeding were Julius Grossman,
Albert Rasp, and Charles Schwarczberg, and Eli Keller of the strikers was
arrested with them.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">She never misses picket lines. You
always see her tramping sturdily along, a short, powerful figure, broad
shouldered, deep breasted, a heavy built woman, strong. Her mouth is a
determined line. Her nose juts out obstinately. Her eyes are two bright
sparkling points. Humor and intelligence are in them and often indignation
and anger. She never misses a meeting. After the meeting you could see
her in the hall talking. Maybe, she&#8217;s telling about what happened on the
picket line, Maybe she&#8217;s telling how her husband first made 15 cents an
hour and pretty so on that is all the workers will be getting if they don’t
win the strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Round and round she&#8217;s always at strike
meetings at night. She is a delegate of the United Front Committee from
the Botany Mills. Some way she embodies the spirit of the strike more than
any one person. Strong, powerful, persistent and is fortified with the
indignation of years. That is Mrs. Anna Breznac. She is not an individual.
She embodies the working mothers whose slow anger is now kindled.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The reporters have called several
of our young picket leaders, Joans of Arc of the strikers. It is fun for
a young girl to lead a parade and to see the glitter of danger flickering
around in the air. When you are young, any change has romance. When you
are 52 years old, crawling out of bed five o&#8217;clock in the morning and walking
miles and miles, passing and repassing the police patrolling the high ramparts
of the mill back and forth, miles and miles, is quite a job. There is a
sturdy defiance about her as she plods up and down. She is tireless. She
always acts as if there is an inward indignation boiling in her. And why
shouldn&#8217;t there be? [Indignation] is a part of the true story of Anna Breznac.
She came to this country from Czechoslovakia when she was a very young
girl. She married a coal digger and went to live in Pennsylvania. The little
Pennsylvania mining towns are very nice towns. They have substantial brick
houses. There are no mean tenements there, the country is hilly and wooded
and full of streams, a hilly good country. Those Pennsylvania hills are
good places for children to grow.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Work was slow in the mines, and Mrs.
Breznac had a relative who wrote her that there was plenty of work in Passaic.
She came to Passaic many years ago. During this time she has had 12 children,
9 of them are living yet. Many of them are small and still in school. Breznac
found work in the Passaic mills for 15&cent; an hour. Recently he has been
making $18.00 a week. Mrs. Breznac makes $16.08.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This has been Anna Breznac&#8217;s life.
Always more children. Children to be gotten ready for school. Children
to be looked after. Children under school age to be cared for. A whole
family living in four rooms and with herself working in the mills. A life
full of effort and toil, of bringing up fine children. A lifetime spent
to the service of the mills, piling up money for somebody else. At the
end of all these years of effort, nothing to show for it except her 9 children.
No house for them. No possessions. A fair living and nothing else for a
life times work.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then come the wage slash. Mrs. Breznac
went on strike. She went on strike with all the power of her strong body,
with all the power and high courage which made it possible for her to bring
up all these children with all the strength of her powerful body that makes
it possible for her, when over 50 to stand the gaff of the terrible night
shift in the mills. Ten hours a night, five nights a week and a quarter
of an hour at midnight for all recess. Indignation was her motor power.
Mrs. Breznac is mad clear through, a fiery indignation sends a hot color
to her cheeks when she thinks of what happened to the workers in Passaic.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mrs. Breznac goes around the picket
line to the halls where the strikers get their coffee. From there to the
meetings and to the picket line again and to strike meeting at night. She
plods through the long strikers day and she is never weary. The hot fire
of indignation never dies down. It is there at the heart of the strike,
smoldering, a red hot coal. There are no girls that is as tireless as she,
for she knows the whole story of a workers life. That is why she is striking
with the indignation bred of the accumulated injustice of years.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When Mrs. Breznac went to Washington
she took with her, her indignation. She walked down through the marble
hallway that led to Senator Borah&#8217;s room a sturdy figure. Come to tell
the capital what the workers in Passaic go through. Come to shout to America
from the Senate steps, &#8220;We don&#8217;t make enough to eat in Passaic". She strode
down to Borah&#8217;s office shouldn&#8217;t she. This was only another kind of picket
line. She was used to picket lines. This was another way of winning the
strike. Mrs. Breznac sat in Borah&#8217;s office and told Senator Borah and Senator
LaFollete about her nine children. She told how her husband had 15&cent;
an hour with which he first began to work in the mills. The reporters of
all big papers were there looking at Mrs. Breznac sitting squarely in her
chair, a hand on each knee, her head thrust out a little answering clearly
the questions that were asked her. Her answer seemed almost unbelievable.
She answered loud and clear, did Mrs. Breznac. She told her story to the
Senators, and she did not speak for herself alone. She spoke for all those
other mothers in Passaic who work all night because the rich mills do not
pay enough to their husbands to support their families.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Sure&#8221;, says Mrs. Breznac, hands
on knees, chewing a piece of gum, &#8220;Sure I got to work nights.&#8221; &#8220;How would
we eat&#8212;me and all my kids? You see,&#8221; she said &#8220; the more kids you got,
the more youngsters in the house, the more in Passaic a woman has got to
work nights.&#8221; She spoke as though she were telling a commonplace, a murmur
went through the company. Borah called it pitiful.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Yes, it is pitiful that the mothers
of children have to work nights. &#8220;The more children they got, the more
they got to work nights,&#8221; but it is a commonplace in Passaic. That’s the
way life goes in Passaic.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mrs. Breznac finished talking to
the Senators, and by the time she had finished talking and the other members
had finished talking, Senators Borah and LaFollete were sure that they
ought to have a Senate investigation. More ought to be known of the textile
workers of the country was what Mrs. Breznac said to them in a tone that
had hot indignation behind it. No one was ever more convincing than she.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mrs. Breznac and the others took
a look around. They sat a while in the Senate Gallery and they walked around
the imposing Capitol grounds. Mrs. Breznac cocked her head and looked up
at the Capitol and wondered if the grave gentlemen inside there were going
to do so much as give the textile workers a hearing.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Next day Mrs. Breznac knocked on
the door of the White House and they let her in, but she could not see
the President.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the White House the way led
to the Department of Labor. Mrs. Breznac told Secretary Davis the story
of Passaic. So she went through the picket lines at Washington tramping
sturdily along. All the Senators in the White House and the Department
of Labor heard her story, told from the white heat of her indignation.
She never misses a picket line.</font>

Line</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the first picket line was formed
at the Forstman and Hoffman plant of Garfield, many of my friends and I
joined. The cops didn&#8217;t care about us at first except when the scabs went
in and we shouted &#8220;Scabs,&#8221; &#8220;Scabs,&#8221; and &#8220;Booh,&#8221; &#8220;Booh,". A few days afterwards,
we thought it would be some fun to shout for the strikers and cheer them
up a bit. So the next day we joined the picket line as usual and started
to sing &#8220;SOLIDARITY FOREVER". The cops chased us off the picket line because
we cheered and sang for the workers and against the bosses. We suggested
that we make a picket line of our own, but this didn&#8217;t suit most of us,
so we all stood in one group and sang and cheered more than before. We
kept this up for about a week. Then one day the cops chased us and told
us to go away from there. We told them that the sidewalks and streets were
public property so we could walk or stand where we please, so he left us
alone for a few days.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One night we all came with orange
bands with the letters F H sewed onto them. As soon as the cops saw us
coming they came up to us before we reached the corner and told us to go
away. We stood still a while to make them sore. Then they told us to &#8220;shake
a leg&#8221;, but we told them the doctor told us we had to walk slow, inch by
inch. Then one of the cops said to us &#8220;Gee, but you&#8217;re tough&#8221; but we told
him that our mothers never cooked us to see if we were tough or not. They
also told us they&#8217;ll give us a ride on the &#8220;pie wagon&#8221;, but we told them
so far, we had enough of rides and pies without them giving us any more.
Gee, but they were sore!</font>

the Mills</font></font></em></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Arlington Mill employs about
5,000 workers. You may gather from the following that the slaves in this
mill are in a paradise of glory and comfort.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The men workers put in 48 hours a
week as regular time. Counting the overtime and the noon hour they have
a nice little week of 57 hours. For the 48 hour week they get an average
of $18. Those working 57 hours get $25.08. Women average from $12 to $16
a week.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Arlington is owned by J. Whitman
Co., owners of many worsted mills in other cities, notably in Bedford where
conditions are even worse than in Lawrence.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The pacific mills produce part woolen
and part cotton goods, employing over 8,000 workers. In the Pacific print
works many old men put in 60 hours a week night work at so low a wage that
they dare not tell the amount. When they ask for more the boss tells them
they better be satisfied, they are so old that they could never get another
job if they are fired.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The doubling up system puts many
out of work. Regular skilled workers get only four days per week in many
cases.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The weavers are tending 32 to 40
looms. Just now a man is experimenting with two cheap helpers to run 102
looms. The wages are lower for this speeding up system than when one weaver
manages 18 looms.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The workers say they cannot live
like this much longer. They must organize so they will be able to demand
better wages and more decent conditions. Get into the United Front Committee.</font>
<center>
<p><b><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The United Front
Committee In Lawrence</font></font></em></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The United Front Committee of Textile
Workers is busy organizing the mill workers in Lawrence, Lowell, Fall River
and other textile centers in New England.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are good beginnings in many
of the mills, some in the form of shop units, factory councils, remnants
of old organizations, new factory committees and so on, and all of them
have delegates in the United Front Committee which binds together all of
them and makes it possible for them to function effectively.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The mill workers realize that this
is the best way to build up their organizations and become a united body
in their fight for better wages and more decent conditions.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The dues in the United Front Committee
is only ten cents a week. This helps to develop the organization and keep
the workers posted on what is going on.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A determined drive is now going on
for the building up of all the units in the mills. In some of the mills
only a few hundred are in the units. It is important that every worker
in a mill get into the unit and be represented in the larger body of the
United Front. Where there are 1,000 in a mill, there should be 1,000 in
the units. Where there are 5,000, there should be 5,000 in the organization.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then there are mills not yet touched
by the organization. These must be reached. It is not hard to get the workers
interested. If you who understand the necessity of organization will do
your little part, you can soon have your mill on the list of those on the
job of organizing.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now is the time to get busy and build
up the United Front Committee and thus get the workers together for the
big fight ahead in the near future.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dear Fellow Workers:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The spirit of organization is taking
hold in Lawrence. The Lawrence United Front Committee of Textile Workers
has been active since its inception but it took the Passaic strike to really
wake them up to their duty as leaders of the textile workers&#8212;in their
fight for better living conditions and against the speeding and doubling
up of work.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Committees drive for new Union
members has been very intensive the past three weeks. Permits were secured
and meetings held in front of all big mills. Last week a big meeting was
held in front of the Arlington mills and several hundreds stood for one
hour in a driving snow storm while &#8220;Mother&#8221; Bloor told them the story of
the Passaic strike. This noontime we held a very successful meeting in
front of the Wood Mill which belongs to the American Woolen Company. Workers
were expecting us and eagerly asked for the Strike Bulletin. Hundreds of
Bulletins were given away. Mother Bloor informed the workers about the
latest strike developments. At the close of the meeting many workers gathered
about Mother Bloor and the two strikers present and asked questions about
the United Front movement.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have held two big mass meetings
here at Eagles Hall and one at Andover, Mass. J. O. Bentall, Editor of
the Strike Bulletin spoke at last Sunday&#8217;s mass meeting and was well received.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A strong Relief Committee has been

the week of April 18<sup>th</sup>.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Lawrence United Front Committee

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">New York had one big night last week.
It was when the workers in that city arranged for two monster mass meetings
at the New Star Casino and at the Central Opera House.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All told, there were about 10,000
workers jammed into those two halls. Thousands were turned away. There
was much cheering when the leaders brought down their heavy sledge hammers
against the brutality of the police in Passaic. There was more cheering
when the speakers told about the fine fight the workers are putting up
in the textile towns.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But when some seventy five men and
women, boys and girls, hooded in gas masks that they had used during the
reign of terror and gas bomb outrages and wearing the iron trench helmets
that they had put on to escape the vicious clubs of the cops in the picket
line, came marching through the center of the halls up to the platform
the cheers, mixed with uncontrollable emotions, knew no bounds. The audience
was on its feet, on the chairs, arms in the air, waving, shouting, women
breaking into tears, strong men choking on their sobs, while wave after
wave of cheering and shouting came rolling forth, ending only when the
strikers had reached the platform and started to sing &#8220;Solidarity Forever.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And there they stood and sang, stood
there in their gas masks and in their helmets&#8212;and sang. They showed
how they carried on while on the picket line and in the strike meetings.
The audience tried to help them sing but couldn&#8217;t. Only the strikers could
sing those songs. They had lived them and felt them, and now they sang
in New York as they had been singing on the picket line. And there stood
Chester Grabinsky, his head bandaged after his scalp had been split by
the police club. But he sang with the rest.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There were many speakers, good speakers.
Forrest Bailey and Robert Dunn of the American Civil Liberties Union acted
as chairmen at the two meetings. Albert Weisbord, strike leader, spoke
at both meetings, spoke well, told of the struggle, of the attacks by the
police and the bosses, of the causes of the strike, horrible conditions
in the mills, more horrible conditions in the homes of the workers ground
down under a starvation wage, of the loyalty of the strikers, how have
behaved and committed no violence, how they have stood the gas bombs and
icy water from the fire hose, how the babies had been used to prevent the
cossacks from riding down the strikers, how the police have even knocked
the babies down&#8212;the whole sordid story of a tyrannical master class
and the whole glorious story of the brave strikers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Others spoke, Gitlow of the Workers

Gurley Flinn of the Civil Liberties Union, Jack Statchel the Young Workers

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">speeches and cheered the strikers

<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Executive Council, American Federation
of Labor,</font>
<br /><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Washington, D. C.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dear Sirs and Brothers:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The heroic and bitter struggle of
the textile workers of Passaic and vicinity against the wealthy, powerful
open shop textile interests has undoubtedly come to your attention. Over
15,000 workers are involved in the strike. They are fighting against low
wages and wage cuts. They are fighting for the abolition of intolerable,
inhuman working conditions. They are fighting for a shorter work day. Most
important is the fact that they are fighting in an unorganized industry
for the right to organize. Furthermore they desire through collective bargaining
to have the industry provide them with a decent living under improved human
working conditions. We are writing this letter to the executive council
of the American Federation of Labor because we feel certain that it, as
the leading representative of the American Federation of Labor, recognizes
that the strike is part of the effort, coupled as it is with great difficulties,
to establish trade union organization and conditions in the textile industry.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The abominable working conditions
that exist in Passaic are general throughout the textile industry. The
deplorable conditions under which the textile workers work and live have
been brought to the attention of the labor movement in the numerous strikes
that took place throughout the country in the last few years against brutal
wage cuts that have been initiated by the textile interests at a time that
the country was reputed to be going through an era of unprecedented prosperity.
Unless this industry which employs about a million workers is brought into
the fold of the organized labor movement, it will act as a stimulus to
the open shop movement and will threaten the better living standards enjoyed
by the workers in industries that are organized.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Organize Textile Workers</font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The organization of the textile workers
is therefore of the most vital importance to the organized labor movement
of America. It is absolutely necessary that steps be taken to organize
this gigantic industry. The present situation calls for the unification
of all the existing labor forces in the textile industry to fight the campaign
of wage cuts, to increase wages, shorter hours, and to organize the million
unorganized textile workers into a powerful textile union.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A step in this direction has been
taken by the Federated Textile union when it decided to send out a call
for a conference of all the existing unions to consider the advisability
of joint action in fighting wage cuts and organizing the industry. The
step taken by the last convention of the American Federation of Labor in
directing the Executive Council to take energetic steps to organize the
textile workers throughout the country is most significant and important.
In appreciation of this, we call upon the executive council of the American
Federation of Labor, in line with this decision to use its experience,
prestige and power to establish the unity of all existing labor organizations
in the textile industry in a campaign to end wage cuts and organize the
industry. The United Front Committee of Textile Workers in Passaic pledges
its wholehearted support to any move towards that end which will be initiated
by the Executive Council. We pledge ourselves that if such a move is made
we will do everything in our power to achieve such unity through the American
Federation of Labor. Never before in the history of the textile industry
were conditions so ripe for the organization of the workers.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Unity of All Labor</font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We must sincerely and earnestly hope
that the Executive Council will consider this proposal in the spirit in
which it is made.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The United Front Committee of Textile
Workers is not a dual organization. It does not desire to set up an organization
distinct and apart from the American Federation of Labor. We will be the
first to hail enthusiastically any proposal the</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">American Federation of Labor will
make to establish unity in order to combat the intolerable conditions that
are forced upon the workers and to organize the industry.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The situation is, we are sure, of
such vital concern to the Labor movement that we take the liberty of presenting
it to the Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Better World for Workers</font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We trust that the Executive Council,
representative of the millions of organized workers in the American Federation
of Labor will consider the proposals made in this letter as proposals coming
from workers who are now engaged in struggle against industrial despotism
and whose only desire is, together with the organized labor movement, to
work for the establishment of improved living conditions and a better world
for the workers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We hope your reply will make possible
greater and more successful efforts toward this end, as far as the textile
workers are concerned.</font>

the strikers went to him. For hours they picketed his house saying that
they were the real strikers, and urged him to see them. On his return he

and Boss&#8212;Low Wages and High Profits</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The strike in Passaic has spread
to Washington. Secretary of Labor Davis has listened to a committee of
the strikers and has proposed a settlement which involves an immediate
return to work pending arbitration proceedings in which the Secretary will
pick the third member of the arbitration committee. The strikers have the
proposal under consideration, but it is by no means sure that they will
accept it stands. This kind of arbitration, as the anthracite miners learned
to their bitter cost in 1920, is not always as fair as it appears on the
surface.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Meanwhile it may not be out of order
to look into the financial affairs of the chief company involved in the
controversy, since the principles at stake are of nation-wide application
and crop up in other industrial conflicts. The facts and figures which
follow are taken from the reports of the Standard Statistics Company. The
Botany Consolidated Mills was incorporated on March 21, 1924, under the
laws of Delaware. Its function is mainly that of a holding company. It
has acquired 90 per cent of the stock of the Botany Worsted Mills in Passaic,
the assets and business of the Garfield Worsted Mills in Garfield, New
Jersey, and large interests in two German textile groups, Kammgarnspinerei
Stohr and Company and the Elberfelder Textilwerke, concentrollin gsome
thirty affiliated companies in Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Italy,
Latvia, and Holland. The foreign companies are engaged in spinning and
weaving woolen fabrics, ribbons, tapes and laces. They employ, all told,
about 11,000 workers. The New Jersey companies constitute complete units
for the manufacture of dress goods, cloakings, and worsted yarns.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the holding company&#8212;christened
the Botany Consolidated Mills&#8212;was organized, it proceeded to issue
$10,000,000 of 6 &frac12; per cent bonds. The bonds were sold by Blair
&amp; Company at 98 &frac12;, and with the proceeds, the holding company
bought the assets and business of the Garfield Mills and part of the stock
of the Botany Mills. The holding company also issued 100,000 shares of
"Class A&#8221; 8 per cent participating preferred stock, with a par value of
$50 a share, and 479,000 shares of common stock without par value. The
Class A stock was sold Blair &amp; Company at 46 &frac12; to 48 per share;
the proceeds were used to obtain an interest in the two German groups and
also to make additional payments for the stock of the Botany Worsted Mills.
Of the common stock, 461,187 shares were given in final payment for the
Botany Worsted Mills stock, and 18,000 shares to hold options in the foreign
companies. Thus a total of 479,187 common has been issued.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the facts as given it would
appear that the 1924 merger was initiated by the stockholders of the Botany
Worsted Mills&#8212;probably the few large holders, as there seems to be
a certain &#8220;minority interest&#8221; to reckon with. These majority holders, one
suspects, organized the holding company, putting up their stock as security
during the preliminary financing&#8212;apparently about 34,000 shares of
the old Botany Mills issue. The financing brought them roughly, $15,000,000
in cash&#8212;$10,000,000 from the bond issue and $5,000,000 from the sale
of Class A stock. With this cash they purchased the Garfield Mills, lock,
stock, and barrel, for a sum as yet unknown, loaned some $4,000,000 to
foreign companies and secured an option for their control, and paid an
unknown, but substantial balance to themselves for the surrender of their
old stock to the new company, In addition, they distributed practically
all of the common stock in the new company to themselves. Thus, while they
went into the deal with 34,000 shares, or thereabouts of Botany Worsted
Mills, they came out with a new operating company purchased outright (Garfield),
important foreign holdings in thirty operating companies, a few million
in cash in pocket, and 479,000 new shares in the holding company. If this
deduction is sound, it would appear that the 1924 merger was the familiar
story of a shrewd reorganization whereby the accumulated surplus of a profitable
company (in this case the Botany Worsted Mills) is made the subject of
the cutting of a large melon in cash, accompanied by a tremendous inflation
in the number of shares of common stock to a no-par basis. Thus, the ratio
of return on common can no longer be referred to a definite par basis,
and any possible criticism for a high index of profitableness is avoided.
Meanwhile, the outside investing public furnishes the cash for the reorganization,
including the purchasing of new and valuable physical assets, by buying
bonds and Class A stock, while the insiders kept the control and the bulk
of whatever profits may be forthcoming.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The profits of the Botany Worsted
Mills averaged $3,160,212 per year for the seven years ended December 31,
1923. On the basis of the 34,000 shares of stock outstanding in the old
company, this would mean an average per year of $93 per share. If the shares
were $100 per, the rate of earnings would be no less than 93 per cent,
small wonder that the shareholders desired to transfer their stock into
a form which invited less criticism. Five or six dollars a share on 470,000
no-par certificates has a better appearance than 93 per cent on 34,000
shares of $100 par&#8212;though the total in cash received is identical.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The profits of the holding company
since the merger are reported as follows:</font>

$2.43&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $0.46</tt>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The last reported balance sheet of
the holding company, June 1, 1925, shows tangible assets of $51,766,000,
and a net worth or stockholders equity of $28,809,000. Current assets are
$27,000,000, while current liabilities are only $12,000,000&#8212;an excess
of over two for one. Meanwhile surplus, or the total value of the no-par
common stock is no less than $23, 809,000&#8212;or about $40 a share.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the strikers go into conference
with their employers, they should bear these facts in mind as contrasted
with the low wages of the workers. The workers should demand that the finances
of their employers be fully revealed in any discussion of wages.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Early every morning till late at
night the poor horse had to work. He worked so hard and his master gave
him little to eat. The harder he worked the less he got. The horse was
so tired and hungry he could hardly walk, but his master whipped him just
the same. The horse could not stand being worked so hard and getting nothing
so he refused to work.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The next morning his master came
and harnessed him but the horse refused to go. The master whipped him so
hard that his bones ached. The horse said to himself, &#8220;This is no good.
I&#8217;m just getting whipped all the more.&#8221; He was walking slowly and thinking.
At last he got the idea into his head. I know I&#8217;ll do: &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to the
other horses and see if they have to work as I do.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So when his master stopped at a house,
the horse saw another horse across the street. He talked with him and he
said he had as hard a time as his fellow worker. He said: &#8220;I&#8217;ll help you
organize and we&#8217;ll all come together refuse to</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">work until they give us food.&#8221; So
the two horses go to work and organize and soon got food.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The horses got what they wanted because
they organized, fought together&#8212;so why can&#8217;t we organize and get what
we want?</font>

Vorse</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As a big Polish woman put down a
steaming bowl of soup before him, he looked up at her and asked breathlessly,</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"M&#8217;am are we going to have milk?&#8221; "Yes, Sonny, she said, &#8220;do you like it?&#8221; &#8220;I never tasted it,&#8221; he said.
"We never had any at home. I always wanted a taste of milk.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He was perhaps eight. He was little
and undersized. His meager features jutted out from his thin face and his
ears were waxen, there seemed to be no blood in them. He had that look
of awful wisdom and sorrow of children whose lives have been spent face
to face in poverty.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The big Polish woman turned away.
"God,&#8221; she said, &#8220;these kids make me cry. I tell you I cried all yesterday
about these kids. First I cried, then I got mad and I won&#8217;t ever stop being
mad. Look at them.&#8221; There they were, 50 or 75 of them eating their soup.
Here are the results of the figures that are printed of the low wage scale.
Here sit the children whose parents make under twenty dollars a week. Here
in terms of lives of children is told the story of Passaic. Great mills,
covering hundreds of acres, high ramparts, walls like prison walls, chimneys
belching smoke, a huge capitalization. All these immense holdings at the
cost of the lives of children. If you wish to light a fire of anger within
you that will never go out, go and look at the children at 25 Dayton Avenue
where the United Council of Working Class Housewives started the first
of their soup kitchens</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">300 children come there every day
to be fed. Most of them are an indictment of our civilization and a condemnation
of the mills of Passaic. Here in prosperous America come children who look
like the children did in blockaded Vienna in 1919. Here are the children
who eat bread and drink black coffee for their principle diet, not now
in strike time, but always.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ask them and find out. Ask John Mureo
how many under working age and what they get to eat. Ask him how old he
is. He looks eight. He is eleven. He has the look of the permanently underfed.
His little chest is narrow and he catches cold easily. He is eleven. In
three more years he can go to work in the mills. When he looks at you with
his blue eyes, that have such a questioning gaze as though he were always
saying &#8220;Why did you do this to me.&#8221; You feel that you are looking in the
eyes of the condemned.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What chance has John Mureo? He has
been starved all his life. He never will get a chance to grow stout muscles.
He will never have red cheeks. Pretty soon the mill doors will be open
and he will be sucked in and when he has paid his life into the mills,
he will die as so many others do during the year so there will be more
dividends and the mills can grow and grow at the cost of hundreds of John
Mureos.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When you see them one by one in their
own homes you do not realize it quite so much. Go to Dayton Avenue and
let the children tell you what is being done to the workers of Passaic.
You do not have to ask questions. Watch the line of children to be fed.
Watch the line of 50 or 75 children eating their mashed potatoes, bread
and butter and fruit. A great feast it seems to them.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Anna Janeks you sit there so quiet,
eating your piece of bread and butter. Your face is pale. Your melancholy
dark eyes have shadows under them. Your little hands are like claws and
your legs are like sticks. What was it cramped your chest and drained the
blood from your cheeks?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hunger, never having enough of anything.
Your father worked all day and your mother worked all night, but between
them they couldn&#8217;t give you enough for a chance to live, what between births
and funerals.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You had to starve so the mills could
grow big. The blood and bones of children like you went into the building
of the great mills of Passaic. Anna Janeks and John Mureo, your suffering
has not been in vain. Everyone who looks at you will feel fury that your
lives and the lives of hundreds of other children have gone into making
the rich mills richer. The workers of America have looked at your little
dwarf bodies. They know that the mills have killed brothers and sisters
of yours as surely as if they had taken a knife and plunged it into their
throats. Anna Janeks and John Mureo sitting in Dayton Avenue, eating a
piece of bread and a bowel of soup, you and hundreds of children who come
here charge the mill owners of Passaic with murder.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before the strike no one heard of
you, but all the workers in America from the Atlantic to the Pacific are
listening to you now. The workers throughout the country know that the
mills have grown rich at the price of human lives.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lawrence held a Flower Day for the
relief of the Passaic strikers today. Thousands of beautiful artificial
roses were sold to the textile workers, who have been on short time with
very low wages. Many collectors came from Boston and Maynard. The Boston
girls were full of pep and showed by their method that they were experienced
Union workers. Five of the Passaic strikers also collected&#8212;Anna Malick
winning the highest honors with the total of over $51.00.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the evening five girls with Mother
Bloor made a tour of the English, German and Franco-Belgian clubs in the
city where workers are in the habit of hanging around. The girls from Passaic
were cheered and encouraged to continue their strike until victory was
assured. The workers in the clubs told the Passaic strikers that Lawrence
was with them and though they got little money themselves, they would contribute
what little they could.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mother Bloor held a largely attended
meeting on the corner of Broadway and Common street in the afternoon and
hundreds of Textile Strike Bulletins were given out. The evening meeting
had to be called off on account of the rain.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All Lawrence now knows that the brave
strikers of Passaic are still fighting hard&#8212;that it is their battle
and only with the moral and financial support of all workers will they
win. The Lawrence-Passaic Relief Committee is now planning to run a moving
picture show and dance at the Winter Garden theater on Saturday May, 1<sup>st</sup>.

is hatching when she gets up on a street corner and tells the workers to
organize into a powerful union for their own protection.</font>

come into Lawrence as outside agitators and help the bosses squeeze profits
out of the mill workers. So these papers warn the people that &#8220;the police

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We hope all the workers will also

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>A Pound of Bread
and a Pound of Poison</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The much heralded relief store of
the American Legion opened last Thursday in Passaic. Of the many strikers
who came to satisfy either curiosity or hunger, few actually received relief.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But those who came with eyes open
were enlightened as to the true nature of this store. Under the guise of
relief a strikebreaking agency is opened here. An attempt is made by this
means to spread the dastardly propaganda of the mill bosses. While with
one hand the Legionaries hold out a pound of bread to the strikers, with
the other they deal them out a pound of poison.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the headquarters of the United
Front Committee relief is given upon one condition only: that the applicant
is in need of help. This fact is verified by the investigation committee
which visits the homes of the applicants to check on the figures given
by them as to the number of dependents, wages, amount of rent paid, etc.
When the relief card is issued, the striker is strongly urged to go out
upon the picket line in order to help win the strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the American Legion store, what
conditions are made for receiving relief? The first one is that the applicant
must present a recommendation from his priest. One priest of the town who
has been favorable to the strike has refused to give such recommendations.
Are we to suppose that the legionaries naively wish by this means to keep
away the atheists which they claim the strike leaders are creating, or
are they rather relying upon the clergy to support them in the other base
conditions which they impose upon the strikers?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The second condition is that the
striker must promise not to go upon the picket line. Renounce the strongest
weapon he has to win his fight; refuse to support the firm, unweakening,
invincible, picket line which through all these weeks has been a menacing
fist thrust constantly into the face of the bosses, is there any worker
now so ignorant or so yellow as to comply with this? The workers can plainly
see that the organization which proposes this is an enemy.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Next the striker must swear that
he opposes the United Front Committee and wants Organizer Weisbord driven
out of town. Does not the American Legion realize that the workers have
already been educated upon this matter? Their petty attacks are coming
to late. Not for nothing have the workers attended the daily mass meetings
of the United Front Committee. Not for nothing have they listened to the
daily lessons of their organizer and of the stream of speakers flowing
constantly from all the trade unions of New York. They know now the benefits
of organization; they know that the United Front Committee which came in
to organize them where others had feared or neglected is their greatest
friend. They will battle to the death for their union, and they know too,
that their organizer is their most valuable leader.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The last condition for obtaining
relief from the American Legion store is to go back to work. This is old
stuff. The workers learned weeks ago that this is the bosses proposal.
They know that once back at their machines without an agreement and without
a recognized union they are in the bosses hands. Are they going to throw
away the efforts of all these long weeks, these weeks of getting up at
5 in the morning in the bitter cold and go on the picket line, of day after
day sitting in meetings, of running about on committees, of all the tireless
work of the strike? Are they going to go back beaten to the dog&#8217;s life
they had before, with no hope of betterment?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No, the mill workers will not fall
for this scab propaganda of the American Legion. They are too wise to swallow
this dose of poison. This relief store merely shows them plainly what the
American Legion is, a tool of the bosses spreading the bosses propaganda,
a strike-breaking agency. Relief will be given to very few strikers in
this store.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The great mass of the strikers will
continue to flock, as before, to the relief organization of the United
Front Committee. The General Relief Committee which is supported by thousands
of dollars which roll in daily in undiminished volume from individuals,
labor unions and organizations in all parts of this country.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Strong in the support of labor and
in their own organization, the strikers will carry on. Like a pebble thrown
against a wall are such attempts as this one of the bosses to break our
strike.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The United Front Committee of Textile
Workers of Passaic, N. J., and vicinity, is in receipt of a letter from
the Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is deeply to be regretted that
the Executive Council has failed to meet the real issues presented to it.
In the letter sent to the Executive Council there was pointed out the disastrous
disunity that exists among the workers in the textile industry. It has
been this disastrous disunity which has played directly into the hands
of the employers, and which all honest working men and women desire to
end as soon as possible.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The United Front Committee of Textile
Workers does not wish to make worse this disunity. It wishes to form a
united front with all organizations that desire to fight in the interests
of the workers, the bosses campaign of wage cuts, speeding up, and longer
hours which the mill owners have launched. We believe that the textile
workers have been abandoned long enough. We are glad to note that the Executive
Council of the Federation of Labor has admitted that the reduction of wages
which has been forced upon the workers in the textile industry is unjust,
unfair, and unwarranted. We wish to remind the Executive Council that the
strike in Passaic is a strike against just such reductions in wages, which
are unjust, unfair, and unwarranted, and we feel that it is for this reason
that the strike has received the fullest support from all sections of organized
labor in this country. We believe that now is the time for organizing the
unskilled workers and for forming one union in the textile industry.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We regret that the Executive Council
of the American Federation of Labor has not taken cognizance of the move
among the various textile unions in this country for unity. The Federated
Textile Unions, a group of five unions, has already called an amalgamation
conference for the near future to which are invited all of the textile
unions throughout the country including the United Textile Workers, the
American Federation of Labor organization, and which the United Front Committee
of Textile Workers will attend.</font>

mills have come out on strike. They surprised the bosses who thought they
had these people like dogs under their feet. They came out and fought against
the conditions in the mills which a human being could no longer stand.
They came out and fought for more money to keep their children and themselves
alive. And in the town of Lodi, which is one of the towns close to Passaic,
the slaves in the great mills of the United Piece Dye Works saw this strike.
They also were textile workers. They dyed the silk and finished it after
their fellow workers in other mills had woven it. And these dye workers
were struggling against conditions that were worse, if such a thing is
possible, than the conditions in the woolen mills.</font>

the surprise of their own bosses, here too, thought they had their slaves

been through hell in their mill and they are determined they will not go
back to those conditions.</font>

have to work breathing steam in some departments every hour of the day.
They have to work in places so hot that it is like&#8212;well, you know the
hottest place there is. Hell hasn&#8217;t got anything on the dye room, and the
steam room at Lodi. And again there are other rooms that must always be
kept cold, so cold that the workers there always have colds in their chests.
They call that place the &#8220;Ice Box.&#8221; Then there is a place called the &#8220;Gray
Room&#8221; where they wash cloth. Vats full of boiling water and chemicals;
a room full of steam and water dripping from the ceiling because of the
steam. A room so full of steam that you can&#8217;t see a certain machine they
have there called the drying machine which is whizzing around at the rate
of 200 revolutions a second, and you are likely to run into this machine
and get killed. Then there are the rooms where they dye the silk, where
the workers have to breathe in the fumes of the chemicals and handle the
chemicals. The workers from Lodi can show you the burns they receive as
bonuses for their work in these rooms.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The United Piece Dye Works bosses
in Lodi see spooks. They are afraid of their own shadow. They think the
workers might hurt their kettles and board fences and buildings.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hence they [hike] themselves off
to an insurance company that insures them against loss of property, in
case of riot.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If some company could be found that
would hold the sheriff and the officials and the bosses themselves in check,
there would be no need in taking out such a policy.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No rioting has taken place by the
strikers in Passaic or Garfield or Clifton. Only the police and the bosses
have rioted. If they were given about six months in the workhouse while
the strike lasts, there would be no need of riot insurance.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We suggest that the bosses in Lodi
be locked up during the strike, and then there will be no rioting.</font>

Kids Picket Chief Zober</font></font></b>
<br /><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>By Mary Heaton
Vorse</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He certainly wasn&#8217;t over four feet
high as he strolled along beside me swinging his shoulders with an independent
air of a kid who has had to look after himself most of his life. A policeman
came down the street toward us. He said scornfully, &#8220;When I was little
I wanted to be a policeman, but now&#8212;&#8221; And then he let out a shrill
taunting yell, &#8220;Cossack! Cossack! Cossack!&#8221; Then he disappeared. Other
voices took the cry up and a band of kids came rushing down the street.
They taunted the officer with &#8220;Cossack!&#8221; Later the kid joined me again.
He seemed always to be springing up from everywhere and I saw him sitting
on the edge of the platform at the strike meeting, his legs dangling down,
reading the Bulletin. He was no angel. He was a hard boiled-kid.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sometimes I&#8217;d see him at a big open-air
meeting, listening to Organizer Weisbord, drinking in everything he said,
not noticing anything around him. We got to talking quite a while before
the day that I first heard him hollering &#8220;Cossack!&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There had been many kids always around,
running in and out of strike headquarters, hanging around the halls, playing
at picketing up and down the street. The kids were insolution in the crowd.
Now suddenly something strange happened. All of a sudden the kids organized.
They seemed all of a sudden to form a kids union of their own. Now the
hard-boiled kid wasn&#8217;t alone yelling &#8220;Cossack!&#8221; There was a whole picket
line of kids&#8212;hundreds of kids&#8212;yelling &#8220;Cossack!&#8221; There had often
been a few kids on the picket line. Now there were hundreds. Their shrill
voices cut through the air as they jeered the police. The police had beaten
their fathers and mothers. They had arrested their brothers and sisters
and the union kids were here to show them what they thought about it. The
police charged down upon the kids and the crowd broke and ran. Then I saw
the tough-faced kid in a little space. His face was white but it was a
mad hornet kind of white. Fury was what was in his face and he grabbed
a rock and threw it at Chief Zober&#8217;s car. That night he got a crowd together
and they went down and picketed Zober&#8217;s house. Zober came out in a fury.
He told them to get out. He told them what he would do to them if he caught
them. They scatter in all directions and disappear like mice. Then all
of a sudden they form into a picket line again and walk past his house,
chanting. What&#8217;s he going to do? He can&#8217;t arrest all the kids in Passaic.
And when they see the way he takes it, they keep it up. It’s a grand new
game. The police had been a very educational thing to the children in Passaic.
In unionism for instance. The last time I saw the hard-boiled kid, he called
out: &#8220;Say, we Union Kid&#8217;s go to [parade] Saturday!&#8221;</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>To All Textile Workers
of Passaic and Vicinity</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dear Fellow workers:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conditions in the textile industry
have become intolerable. The speeding and doubling up systems that the
bosses have put into effect have thrown thousands of workers into the streets.
Wages are so low that homes have to be locked up through the day while
the family works&#8212;or walks the streets looking for work. After a survey
the government reports that $50.00 is the minimum wage for a family of
three to live decently upon and $35.00 for a single person. Many Lawrence
workers would drop dead if on some pay day when they greet the paymaster
they should discover a neat crisp $50.00 bill inside the envelope. Workers
in the textile industry everywhere are waking up to the fact that they
are human beings and must LIVE like human beings. Passaic is fully awake
and in the face of gas bombs and clubs used by the police are standing
shoulder to shoulder, men, women and children in their battle for better
conditions, more wages and recognition of the Union.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Strike talk has been in the air in
Lawrence for the past week. The bosses are aware of this and have prevented
the Lawrence United Front Committee from holding its usual mill gate meetings.
But the bosses make your bad condition in the mills and cut our wages,
not the United Front Committee. When the police interfere for the mill
men and try and prevent us from telling you the truth about Passaic it
will not increase your wages, stop old men from getting fired because of
their age and solve the unemployment. The United Front Committee tells
you that the only remedy is to ORGANIZE&#8212;that organization is insurance
against a strike. We know that a strike is coming again in Lawrence because
your conditions are just intolerable, but we appeal to you fellow-workers
not to go out Unorganized. Join your shop unit. The United Front Committee
has the machinery and won&#8217;t let a striker starve. If strike&#8212;strike
in an ORGANIZED MANNER.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Yours for the United Front.</font>

Mills Intolerable</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We workers in the shop read the Bulletin
each week. It is the most interesting paper for the workers we have ever
read. It tells the truth about the rotten conditions in the textile industry.
All Lawrence workers should support it. Conditions at the Arlington Mills
are very bad and we workers can&#8217;t stand it much longer. We are doubled
and speeded up so much that we are all tired out at night when our work
is finished. Five years ago one man was running a dolly (washer). Today
one man is doing seven men&#8217;s work for only $19.68 a week. Two years ago
the workers in the Crab room were earning as high as $65.00 to $70.00 a
week; Now we have to work hard for $24.00 to $25.00 a week.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the Singe room where they did
have 22 men, they now have 4 men doing the same amount of work. They work
five days for $17.94.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the Filling room where they used
to do 3 rounds a day 3 years ago, they now are doing 8 rounds for $17.94
in five days work.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the Tacking room where they used
to tack 35 pieces a day, they are now tacking from 70 to 80 pieces for
$17.94 a week for five days.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On top of all this we are put on
short time and we are lucky to earn $15.00 a week.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are organizing and if conditions
don&#8217;t change very soon the only thing us Arlington mill workers will be
to join Passaic.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Civil rights are now abolished in
Passaic! What amounts to the final proof was given on Monday when the Passaic
police court officials refused to issue warrants for the arrest for Zober
and twelve policemen on charges of atrocious assault merely because the
complainants were strikers!</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fifteen complainants were attorneys
from the Civil Liberties Union, went to the police court to keep their
appointment with George M. Rice, clerk of the court, who had said he was
"too busy&#8221; to issue warrants on them on Saturday, but would meet them on
Monday. Abram Saks, of Paterson, as local attorney, was called into the
private office of the clerk where he met Police Judge William Davidson,
the clerk, and Chief of Police Richard O. Zober. Davidson did the talking.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I will not accept any complaints
in this court from any of the complainants who are involved in the strike,&#8221; he said.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Here are two complaints sworn by
people who are not strikers. Will you accept their complaints?&#8221; asked Mr.
Saks.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I will not accept any complaints
in this court against any member of the police department or any special
policeman as long as the matter under complaint is anything that the police
did was in the performance of their duties,&#8221; said Judge Davidson.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The refusal of Judge Davidson to
allow warrants to be issued will not prevent the American Civil Liberties
Union from taking further action on the hundred or more cases of clear
violation of civil rights in Passaic that have been investigated by their
attorneys. Other legal measures will be used according to the attorneys
for the Civil Liberties Union.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>"Picket on the Picket
Line&#8221;</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As the strike went into its eleventh
week, activity on the picket lines increased. How the clubs of the cops
flew after they had covered up their numbers on their badges! How the bosses
shuddered when they saw the workers return with a bigger, firmer line after
each attack! And why shouldn&#8217;t they shudder? They know full well that you
can&#8217;t trick the strikers now,&#8212;the strikers who consider every scar
a badge of honor, who sing all day in jail, who lead the line in bandages
after they have brutally attacked by those servants of bosses, the rioting
Passaic police.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nearly every leader was arrested
during the week, and those most familiar to the police got the heaviest
sentences, the usual sort of &#8220;justice&#8221; for strikers in the Passaic court.
Jack Rubenstein was given a sentence of six months on the charge of disorderly
conduct. Nancy Sandowsky, Sam Lachuk, Theresa Standiger, Andrew Boukowsky,
were awarded thirty days each for making themselves prominent on the line.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Joe Beokosewitz fared the worst of
all. He was arrested on Thursday, the day before his wife and five small
children were to be put out of their home because they couldn&#8217;t pay the
rent. He didn&#8217;t mind being arrested. He didn&#8217;t mind being evicted&#8212;that
was part of the fight. But he did mind the way the judge replied to the
lawyer&#8217;s plea that he should be permitted to help his family move. &#8220;This
is a very pathetic case, a very sad case. I am very sorry for the little
children and the mother. Ninety days.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Others were arrested on the picket
line. Lena Chernenko is still waiting trial. Mike Elasik and Anna Fischer
and Frances Janecke and Stephen Gede were all arrested. Louis Teth, Tony
Anarcon, Eva Misko, Louise Buccino, Tom Regan, and Frank Huber&#8212;they
were all arrested and so were many others.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Lodi picket lines were stronger
than ever before. John Di Santo, and Frank Kelly and Feliz Panerisi have
been heading rousing lines. More and more women have appeared on the Lodi
picket lines. Vincent Ali, Philip Russo, Jack Caltarella, and Mary Goil
were some of those who suffered arrest on the picket lines. The police
there threaten to carry their clubs again.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Stand Firm</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Workers! The bosses are threatening
us in every way. The renewed, uncalled for attack by the police means that
they are desperate. The mass arrests and the brutal treatment ordered by
the bosses means that they are making a hopeless last attempt to break
the strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The bosses have ordered that no more
mass picketing be allowed. They have no right to give such orders to the
workers. The workers have a right to peaceful mass picketing They will
continue the mass picketing in spite of the order given by the bosses.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The bosses are trying to fool the
workers by telling them that the mills will open. The mills have been open
all the time, but the workers have not entered them to start work. Only
a few scabs have entered the mills. The bosses cannot run the mills without
scabs.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Julius Forstmann is trying to scare
the workers by announcing that his mills will open soon. He tells you that
his union wants the mills to open. His company union is made up of the
bosses and the suckers. The real workers do not belong to this company
union. The suckers belong to it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These suckers are compelled by the
bosses to vote that the Forstmann-Huffman mills be opened. No workers have
asked or voted for this.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The daily papers in Passaic are helping
the suckers to fool the workers. These sucker papers are with the bosses.
They want you to lose the strike. They want you to go back like whipped
[dogs]. You will remember these sheets as soon as the strike is over and
not read them. You will remember that these sucker papers stand with the
company like the company union, and that they want you back into slavery.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our answer to the bosses will be
a stronger picket line. We will answer them with a stronger union of the
workers. We will tell them that we do not need their sucker union, for
we have a union of our own.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now we must stand firm. Now is the
time to show all the workers in this country that we are standing solid.
Our ranks are stronger. Our union is bigger and more powerful. Our determination
is unbreakable. With every attempt of the bosses to break the strike we
get more determined that it shall not be broken.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are writing victory on our banner.
We are singing more lustily than ever. We are waging a battle for our rights.
Our ranks are more solid. They are bigger. They will be doubled when the
children come out on strike with us.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is our answer to the bosses
and their suckers. Stand firm! Tighten up the ranks! Fight on! Fight on
to Victory!</font>

<p><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Statement of Abram Waks March
29, 1926.</font></em></center></p>

<p><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the complainants together
with their attorneys Abram Waks, of Paterson and Charles M. Joseph of New
York, arrived at the Passaic police station, according to the appointments
made with the clerk of the police court, George M. Rice, they were directed
into the court room, and were asked to wait until the clerk was ready to
receive the complaints. After a short delay, Mr. Waks was invited into
the private room of the clerk and there was met by Judge Davidson, Chief
Zober, and the clerk. Judge Davidson then stated to Mr. Waks that he was
surprised that a reputable attorney of the State of New Jersey should give
his services in making complaints against the police department.</font></em>
<p><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr. Waks replied that these complaints
were not against the police department as such but against individual members
of the department who had violently and viciously assaulted and clubbed
the complainants, some of whom were not in any way connected with the strike.
The Judge then asked for the names of the complainants making remarks as
to the activity of some of them on the picket line. He refused to accept
any complaints in his court from any of the complainants who were involved
in the strike. When asked by the attorney for the complainants whether
he would accept complaints from those who were not involved in the strike,
he further stated that no complaints would be received in his court against
any member of the police department as long as the matter under complaint
was anything that the police did while in the performance of their duties.</font></em>
<p><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He stated further that he could
not see how any rights of the complainants were violated, in view of the
fact that the new Simpson act for the regulation of strike picketing made
it unlawful for the complainants to be on the streets en mass. When informed
by attorney for complainants that the Simpson act, if approved and passed
was not yet in effect, he made no comment.</font></em>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Health Bureau Gives
Figures</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The members of the Workers Health
Bureau were here investigating conditions at the same moment when Senator
Edwards made his famous &#8220;investigation". They were not interested in pleasing
the bosses but in finding out facts and analyzing some of the terrible
conditions under which the mill workers live. People in Passaic die like
flies. They die from diseases that are preventable because the bosses won&#8217;t
spend the money. Here are some of the things that the Health Bureau has
to say in contradiction to the Andrew McBride who told Senator Edwards
that the mills were such health resorts that hundreds of people spend the
summer in them to breath the nice pure mill air.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In the dye section of the textile
industry which employs about 11,000 workers in Paterson and Lodi alone,
workers are exposed to terrific heat, excessive moisture and steam and
to powerfully poisonous chemicals and dyes that undermine the vitality
and strength of the workers and call for immediate and drastic regulation.
On top of these hazards it should be borne in mind that workers are compelled
to labor sixty to seventy hours a week in order to earn from $22.00 to
$27.00, an amount on which no family can maintain itself. The inevitable
result is not only disease and premature death but the exploitation of
child labor in order to supplement the meager earnings of the mothers and
fathers. To disregard the basic connection between economic conditions
and health is to ignore the very foundation of the problem.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Conditions in the textile and textile
dying industry of this country call for thorough investigation into trade
hazards, hours, wages and child labor and demand the formulation of specific
and clearly defined safeguards which will guarantee health protection to
the workers. The elimination of poisons, exhaust ventilation to remove
dust, fumes, steam, the guarding of all dangerous machinery, the provision
of all necessary sanitary facilities and the establishment of union standards
of wages, hours and working conditions are imperative. For the benefit
of the exploited workers now on strike in the Passaic textile mills, the
Workers Health Bureau, a national trade union health agency, has undertaken
an exhaustive study into existing working conditions in order to define
a standard of health protection for the industry.&#8221;</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The strikers have stiffened up. The
bosses have resorted to their weapon of brutality and intimidation. The
strikers have resorted to their big weapon of constantly bigger picket
lines.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the bosses agencies have asked
for a strike settlement, the strikers have always been ready. We have invited
the bosses themselves to come and meet the Committee of Workers and talk
matters over.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have always been ready to negotiate
and to settle the strike. We are ready now, and will be ready at all times.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But the bosses have refused to meet
us. Their only word has been that the workers go back to work first and
then the bosses will talk things over.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is sheer cowardice and hypocrisy.
It is not evidence of good faith on the part of the bosses.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now since the bosses cannot break
the strike by fooling the workers or starving them back, they are resume
their terrorism and their lies and their underhanded methods. Now they
go the limit in brutality. They have ordered their cossacks to beat down
in bloody assaults men and women, young and old. They have piled up the
list of arrests with bail that runs into the thousands of dollars. They
have come out like desperate beasts that are bent upon big killings. It
is a sordid story of tyrants and of oppression and of wrongs against helpless
workers who would be like cattle in the slaughterhouse if it were not for
their determination to organize and get ready to protect themselves against
such beastly attacks.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the strikers are always ready
to settle if the bosses grant their demands, the strikers more determined
than ever to fight to the finish for their rights. They have sized up the
situation and know that the bosses can put up a fierce array of brutal
cohorts to beat down the workers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But they have also counted the host
of workers and the resources of the whole working class of this country.
They have even become aware of a fact that the working class of the whole
world is watching Passaic and will stand by the workers in Passaic.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therefore the strikers are meeting
the bosses with firmness, always ready settle if the bosses will settle-right,
but also ready to fight to the last ditch if the bosses continue their
present tactics.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Albert Weisbord is free. He came
to his friends, his fellow workers to speak to them as he has spoken every
day for twelve long weeks of the strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A vast throng had gathered on Monday
to greet him. Carried on the shoulders of strong men, he was brought through
the packed mass of strikers to the platform. There was cheering and shouting
as the great gathering saw their leader who had been taken from them and
held in prison for a whole week.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Baskets of flowers and bundles of
roses came to the platform. Hands went up. Hats were thrown into the air.
Handkerchiefs waved. Twelve thousand men and women, boys and girls and
children joined in the mighty welcome. The shouting and cheering lasted
and lasted. Wave after wave of cheering and shouting rolled on.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was a great demonstration. It
was a fine welcome to a man who has given his all in the fight for the
workers in Passaic and the rest of the strike area. The workers were solid
after a week&#8217;s absence of their leader. They had not gone back to work.
Their ranks were more solid than they had ever been since the beginning
of the strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Weisbord was freed on bail on Saturday.
He had been held in the Passaic county jail in Paterson for a week, and
released from there on Saturday on $35,000 bail, but immediately re-arrested
by the Garfield police and brought before Recorder Baker, who also held
him under $25,000 bail. Baker [then] promised that the bail would be only
$15,000 and the American Civil Liberties Union was there to furnish this
amount. But when Baker found that out he raised the bail to $25,000, which
he thought would be beyond securing. A man of means came forth to offer
the remaining $10,000, but Baker would not [stand] by his word and said
he did not care for the right or wrong in this case, but refused to let
Weisbord out even though the full amount of bail was ready.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On Sunday the attorneys for Weisbord
made another attempt to get him out. They appealed to Judge Soufert and
he [reduced] the bail from Bakers $25,000 to the smaller sum of $5,000,
which was some come-down for both bail and Baker. This was furnished Sunday
morning and Weisbord was once more outside the bars.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the meeting in Wallington which
took place on the lots offered by the mayor when he had heard that Passaic
and Garfield had driven the strikers out by riot acts and police clubs,
Weisbord told the strikers that he was glad to be among them again and
find them ten times stronger than before. He advised them to carry on in
the peaceable manner that they had always done and win the strike and build
solid union.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The boast by the bosses that the
mills would open fell on deaf ears. No strikers went back. They came to
the meeting to see and hear their leader. Pickets watched the gates but
there was nothing to do as the scabs had quit cold and [feared] the strikers.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>"Arrest Weisbord!&#8221;</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The screaming headlines flashed through
the strike zone at one o&#8217;clock Saturday afternoon. It was like the yell
of the bosses thirsting for the life of the leader who had held the strikers
adamant against them. The air was electric in the mass meeting in Belmont
Park. It was the last meeting before Weisbord&#8217;s arrest. Every one knew
that. But there was no fear. Weisbord came. He was swept from his feet.
While the crowd shouted with wild enthusiasm, he was carried to the platform
on the shoulders of the strikers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Stand firm. Carry on the strike
as before. Hold the fort while I am gone.&#8221; These were his parting words.
And the workers saw their beloved leader depart.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The automobile took Weisbord at once
back to strike headquarters. There, tense with determination, his galvanic
will unimpaired, his mind clear, electric as ever, he dictated a last statement
to the press.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Understanding how the bosses manipulate
the law and the police for their own purposes, the workers will know that
this reign of terror is a sign of weakness in the mill owners……. This is
the last desperate move of the bosses to break the strike…..&#8221; &#8220;While I
am gone the work will be conducted with as great a vigor and efficiency
as before.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No sooner had Weisbord given out
his last message of solidarity and strength than the expected move came.
The door opened. Seven great hulking detectives strode into the room.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"You&#8217;re wanted at police headquarters,&#8221; said officer Potosnak, yanking Weisbord by the arm.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another one of these sweet specimens
of humanity grabbed the organizers hat and slammed it on his head.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Come on now,&#8221; said a third, as he
gave Weisbord a shove.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Never for a moment did the leader
lose his self-possession. He smiled slightly. The burly dicks hustled him
out of the room, prodded him down the stairs. The workers in the office
stood in a group at the top, their hearts following him. &#8220;Three cheers
for Weisbord !&#8221; they shouted, all their faith and love ringing in their
voices.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Barely had the newspapermen time
to snap a hasty shot. The strike attorney, Mr. Unger, to his indignation
was given no time to consult with his client. Weisbord was whisked to jai1.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then when it was all over, when hours
had passed, the facts stood out clearly. This was an illegal arrest. No
warrant had been shown; no complaints had been presented. There was no
warrant; there was no complaints. Weisbord was held -</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">incommunicado. Anxious friends besieged
the police station; no information would be given. Zober sent them to Turner
and Turner sent them back to Zober. No one would assume responsibility;
no one would state the charges.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And how these petty officials strutted
in the glory of this great achievement. How smug was the whole atmosphere
as they gloated over this illegal arrest. They had trapped the leader.
Zober stuck out his chest and strutted about like a bloated turkey cock
with revolvers bulging out of his hip pockets. Even the cops, the women
beaters, the head splitters, were particularly cocky that day.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the wee hours of Sunday morning,
at last the attorney was permitted to see his client for a few minutes.
Still, there were no charges. The officials were waiting to search the
material they had taken from headquarters, hoping to get heaven knows what
damnable evidence. They got nothing. Only on Monday morning, after Weisbord
had been held for forty-four hours, were complaints shown to him. Trumped
up complaint; trumped up charges.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Yes, they had trapped the leader!
And from Weisbord in jail went out a great contagion of courage. It was
an electric wave of enthusiasm greater than any the strike had yet known.
Break the strike?…… the bosses had given the strike the greatest impetus
they or anyone else had yet given it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Stronger than ever, more than ever
firmly entrenched in public support, with Weisbord in jai1, the workers
are carrying on.</font>

<br /><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>By Esther Lowell</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"This is a martial law court!&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Little justice of the peace Lewis
M. Hargreaves pulled himself up importantly and tried to impress the crowd
of strikers and their friends packing the tiny Garfield courtroom. He thought
he was a moving picture hero conducting a court martial&#8212;and no back
talk from anyone.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But lawyer Arthur Garfield Hays,
from the American Civil Liberties Union, who has seen lots of judges, saw
Hargreaves as small as he actually is and not as big as he thinks he is.
He talked back and defied the justice to arrest him for contempt of court.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"There&#8217;s no chance of justice for
strikers here!&#8221; Hays declared. &#8220;In all my experience in mining towns and
other places, I&#8217;ve never seen anything like it for a land that is supposed
to be free.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Justice Hargreaves threatened to
arrest the lawyer for disorderly conduct.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We&#8217;d call it contempt of court in
New York,&#8221; Hays replied.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"You&#8217;re in New Jersey now!&#8221; the justice
shouted but did not take action against the lawyer.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I came to the bar. A ruddy faced
Garfield cop stepped up to complain against me. He admitted that he had
arrested me within three minuets after sheriff Nimmo had read the riot
act so hysterically in front of Forstmann-Huffman mill, which he and his
deputies now use for barracks.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then I told how I had been up in
front to get a good story. (You see, the labor papers for which I write
want to know the truth about the strike.) I said I had stopped to help
up a women the cops had knocked into the gutter. When I turned around and
started walking quickly, I told the court sheriff, Nimmo screamed, &#8220;Grab
her!&#8221; and the cop dragged me off to the patrol wagon.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mary Heaton Vorse told how surprised
she had been to see me arrested while I was walking rapidly on.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But justice Hargreaves wouldn&#8217;t act
on the case without orders. He went out of the courtroom, probably to call
sheriff Nimmo at Forstmann-Huffman mill. When he came back he refused to
admit the ridiculousness of the case and held me for the grand jury on
$1500 bail, which attorney Hays kindly furnished for me.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hargreaves wouldn&#8217;t budge on Robert
Dunn&#8217;s case, which had been brought up when attorney Hays was misdirected
upstairs by the police. Dunn, American Civil Liberties Union officer, was
held for the grand jury at $10,000. Dunn was picked up shortly after I
was, while we were trying to disperse peacefully, and his offense was the
same&#8212;disorderly conduct according to the charges.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The little justice refused to reduce
bail for Robert Wolf, New York writer who came to the Belmont Park meeting
broken up the day after the riot act was read. Wolf was held for $5,000
because he wouldn&#8217;t move on as fast as the cop wanted.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hargreaves has an office in Hackensack
in which there is a sign: &#8220;Real Estate, Insurance, Collections, Adjustments,
Surety Bonds, Justice of the Peace and Notary Public.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"And they call this justice!&#8221; exclaimed
one of the young girl strikers who sat in the court learning a new lesson
that school teachers and text books never teach.</font>

Gate Meetings but Workers Go Right Ahead</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For three weeks past the United Front
Committee of Lawrence held meetings at noontime near the mill gates to
inform all textile workers about the Passaic strike. Bulletins were distributed
by the thousands to anxious and expectant workers who in turn brought them
into the shops and tacked them on the walls or hung them on the frames.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because of this very effective work
the bosses became terrified and said: &#8220;These mill gate meetings must stop.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When I went to the police station
the following Monday for the usual permits, I was told we could hold &#8220;no
more mill gate meetings.&#8221; When I asked what would happen if we insisted
upon our Constitutional rights of free speech and held the meetings ---
the answer was that &#8220;we would be arrested.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A committee was then elected from
the United Front Committee to visit the marshall and ask the reasons for
refusal. The marshall again refused the United Front to hold the meetings
and would give no reason. The reason, of course, is obvious to all clear
thinking workers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the United Front Committee was
composed of a conglomeration of political fakers it would be easy to obtain
any street corner in the city. But since the United Front&#8217;s politics is
strictly working-class the bosses are horrified and set their machinery
at work to prevent us from reaching the great mass of workers. But they
won&#8217;t succeed. The truth about the strike of 16,000 textile workers of
Passaic will be told to the Lawrence workers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Workers who read this article may
rest assured that the United Front intends to fight for their Constitutional
rights of free speech and that very soon meetings will again be held at
the mill gates. Watch for us fellow-workers. Watch for the Textile Strike
Bulletin. Fight for your rights. Organize. Join the United Front.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fellow Workers of Passaic:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As a Lawrence mill worker and a reader
of the Textile Strike Bulletin, I have taken a great interest in the conditions
which existed in your mills before you started your heroic battle against
the greedy millionaire mill owners. I feel sure that you are also interested
to read about the conditions of work of your fellow workers as they exist
in the mills of Lawrence.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I am a weaver in one of the largest
mills of Lawrence. The department where I spend my young days is situated
in the basement where daylight is almost shut out and poor electric lights
burn all day long. As soon as you enter this department you can feel the
foulness of the air.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We work on twelve looms. The warps
are black, the work is very bad. We earn about $9 to $17 a week with the
sweat of our brow. Several months ago we took charge of 6 looms and earned
then about $30 a week. Now the number of looms are doubled and our wages
amount to about half.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As a result of the speeding up systems
introduced by our bosses who are always seeking for ways and means to enlarge
their big profits, many workers in our mills are unemployed or partly employed.
Our conditions here are quite rotten.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I often wonder fellow workers of
Passaic when are we workers in the mills going to realize that if we only
stick together and organize we can do away with our present unbearable
conditions.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Providence Collectors
Stopped by Police&#8212;At Senator Metcalf&#8217;s Mills</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Six members of the Passaic Relief
Committee were held by the Providence police this morning for an attempt
to collect money and distribute Strike Bulletins at the gates of the Wanskuck
Mills, owned by U. S. Senator Jesse Metcalf of R. I.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"You cannot collect money or distribute
that paper here.&#8221; said the plain clothes thug as he showed his police badge.
In answer to a question by one of the workers he replied that the company,
(Metcalf) owned the land and street for ten miles on either side.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The committee went outside the rail
which bounds the factory and there tried to do their work. Immediately
a police patrol wagon with six stalwart minions of the law were on the
scene. The Sergeant asked for a copy of the paper&#8212;it was given him.
When asked whether it was alright to proceed with the distribution the
sergeant ordered the questioner to get off the sidewalk.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"This is a newspaper,&#8221; he said to
the plain clothes man, &#8220;we cannot take them for giving this away."&#8230;.Again,
he ordered Murdoch to get off the sidewalk, where he was listening to the
conversation and pushing for a decision as to whether it was within the
law to distribute a newspaper. &#8220;Get to hell out of here,&#8221; he roared, in
quite brave fashion. The committee refused to budge till he said whether
they were violating any law of the state.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The sergeant then proceeded to take
the names and addresses of the committee and their places of work….. (you
were fooled sergeant, dear), and then he left to confer with his captain
as to what he must do.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The patrolman left in charge proved
to be quite human and sympathetic to the strike where he has two cousins
in the Passaic Line. &#8220;We have to protect Metcalf&#8217;s mills or he will have
us fined or fired,&#8221; he stated. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to ride in that machine,
Nelly,&#8221; he teased. &#8220;No,&#8221; said Nelly, &#8220;but if I have to I am ready to go
the whole road for this strike if I must.&#8221; &#8220;That is the spirit that wins,&#8221; commented the &#8220;cop.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Meanwhile the mill came out and a
sympathetic crowd of textile workers gathered to see what would happen.
Despite the presence of the police and without being solicited these workers
contributed $3.85 to the strike fund. Back came the bold sergeant, quite
hot under the collar, and roared to the workers, &#8220;Get to hell out of here
or I will have you arrested for obstructing the sidewalk,&#8221; and turning
to the collectors, &#8220;You get into this car and see what the captain has
to say,&#8221; so we rode in a Packard car to interview the big chief.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Why did you come down here? Who
sent you into Providence to start trouble?&#8221; the captain asked Murdoch.
"Did Reid tell you you could do this? What right have you to help this
strike?&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When it was explained that there
was a committee at work in Boston on which he as a member of the Machinists
union served and that all the sincere unions in the city were helping the
strike, the captain changed his tone. &#8220;But you attack our government, the
President and the police,&#8221; he wept, pointing to the Bulletin which lay
on his desk.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"President Coolidge should use his
position to order an investigation of the textile industry, and the Passaic
police have no right to club working women and children for walking on
the street,&#8221; was the reply.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"There is prosperity in the textile
industry and this is due to the existence of a Republican administration
and the leadership of President Coolidge,&#8221; said the captain.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Does $10 a week spell prosperity
to you?&#8221; he was asked.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He asked again, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go
back to Scotland if you are not satisfied with this country?&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Scotland is just as bad as America,&#8221; was the reply. The workers are organizing all over the world to change
their conditions.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"This is the Nellie that they are
all talking of,&#8221; he greeted the four women workers. &#8220;Where do you come
from?&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Northhampton, the home of President
Coolidge,&#8221; was the reply.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He then proceeded to question the
girls as to their position on the relief committee. &#8220;You&#8217;re not allowed
to collect in Providence without our permission,&#8221; he stated.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">During the questioning they tried
to connect Reid with the distribution of the Bulletins at the mill gate.
This is an attempt to frame him as inciting others to violate the state
law. Reid was the workers candidate who ran against Metcalf for the U.
S. Senate in 1924.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Metcalf introduced the two loom system
in his mills in 1903 and locked out his workers for 13 weeks, only taking
half of them back, at the end of the period. Reid as a school boy collected
money for the locked out workers. Today, Metcalf tries to frame him because
he is the workers leader in Rhode Island against the wage cuts and lengthening
of hours. The workers of Rhode Island should remember this incident at
the next election.</font>

Striker Saw</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I have visited many families that
are in urgent need of relief but there is one family in Garfield on Prospect
Street that is a most pitiful sight. There are six small children in this
family ranging from the ages of twelve to two. The father is a widower.
His wife died two years ago when the seventh child was born. He is a middle
age man of forty now but has the appearance of a man of sixty. His hair
is gray and his features show that he has gone through many hardships since
he came to America. His shoulders are bent and he drags his feet as he
walks along.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">His children seem to be happy despite
the condition they have been forced into. They wear dresses and clothes
provided for them by a union relief store. This family lives in the cellar
of a brick house that is weather beaten and falling apart. Bricks are missing
here and there and the wind comes right into the house from the outside.
Inside the house the walls are wet from the dampness and the water falls
down on the floors while the children are playing and crawling on the bare
floors. Sometimes as they crawl their hands slide over the floor and they
get splinters into their little hands.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The furniture consists of two beds,
one chair, two benches, one table, seven cups and saucers, plates, a few
knives and forks. The windows have a white piece of linen to shade it at
night. I asked about his wages and he replied that if he works forty-eight
hours he makes twenty-two dollars but that for the past two years he had
been working part time, two and one half to four days a week. Therefore
it was impossible for him to raise and feed his family properly. He came
out to strike for a living wage.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Are Officials Strikebreakers</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What do the officials of Passaic
intend to do to the workers that are on strike here? Do they think that
by bringing in armed thugs to shoot down the strikers they will end the
strike? Don&#8217;t you, the officials of Passaic and vicinity think that the
workers have a right to strike for a better living condition? Don&#8217;t you
think that we have a free constitutional right to walk peaceably up and
down the very streets that we pay taxes for? Haven&#8217;t the workers even the
right to organize?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is a disgrace upon the American
soil for these officials in Passaic to order to club down, to beat and
gas honest working men and women and even children. It isn&#8217;t necessary
to enlarge the police force. It isn&#8217;t necessary to put the firemen on police
duty nor bring to Passaic armed thugs, for there is no violence nor riots
committed by the strikers. If there was any violence or riots in Passaic
it was done by the police of Passaic and the Chief of Police himself, Richard
O. Zober.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I would like to ask whether the officials
of Passaic are trying to break the strike playing hand and glove with Col.
Johnson or are they with the workers? Only a strikebreaker would order
to club down innocent workers. The people of Passaic have the opinion that
these officials are nothing but grafting strikebreakers, which in my belief
is the right opinion. If not, why do they do these things which are unbearable
to the human eye to look upon and which happen in Passaic.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All during the strike the strikers
have been peaceful, even when the police have provoked and still are trying
to provoke the strikers into violence. The strikers have learned their
tricks. Now the police beat them down like dogs, just because the strikers
are determined to stay out of work until the bosses get ready to settle
and settle right. The closing down of halls or the breaking up of picket
lines is not going to break the strikers spirit. They have put Weisbord
in jail thinking it will break the strikers spirit, but instead it gave
a stronger determination to the strikers to bring this struggle to a VICTORY.</font>

friends&#8212;not the cops, but Bob Dunn, Jack Rubenstein, Clarence Miller,
and four other strikers who had been pinched the day before. I gave them
the news and they gave me the prison library, a copy of <em>Life</em>, and
of <em>Detective Story Magazine</em>. It is very pleasant to meet your friends
in jail, pleasanter than you might think in case you haven&#8217;t been there.
On the other hand I don&#8217;t think it would be so good to be in jail alone.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We waited, because there was nothing
else to do. Presently the cops called: &#8220;Robert Dunn.&#8221; From what Bob told
us afterward, they shot him through in record time downstairs, while Hays,
our lawyer, was deliberately misdirected to another room. They fixed his
bail at ten thousand dollars. Ten thousand dollars! Somewhere in that Constitution
they profess to be so particular about there is a provision against excessive
bail. But what do they care?&#8212;they decided Bob was an important strike
leader, and one and all, sheriff, cops and justices of the peace, they
are engaged in this vast conspiracy to break the strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Bob came back, and they called me.
When I left the lockup they were all there&#8212;Bob and the other six. When
I got back again they were all there again, only Rubenstein was nursing
a bruise on the back of his neck. In the meantime, while Hays was engaged
downstairs with me, they had shot the six through, secretly, upstairs,
without allowing them any council, sentenced one of them to sixty days,
fixed bail for the rest at ten thousand dollars and slugged Rubenstein
in the back of the neck.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This was all too fast for me ---
I was getting bewildered. They explained to me what had happened to them,
and I explained to them what had happened to me. Bob said to me, &#8220;I hope
they get us out of here before nightfall&#8212;I&#8217;m afraid they&#8217;ll bust in
and beat Rubenstein up.&#8221; A big, burly lieutenant came to the door with
a grin on his face, and said,&#8212;oh, it was all in joke of course ---
"Well jack, glad to see you again. You&#8217;ve been busting in here too often.
The next time you come in here we won&#8217;t leave a thing left.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then we saw an excellent example
of what the textbooks call class justice. We began to have callers ---
people from New York. They came by twos and ones and dozens. And fortunately
--- fortunately for us&#8212;they were well dressed. Immediately our cops
began to be more polite. There is nothing like a shined shoe or a white
collar to win a cop&#8217;s respect. I am especially grateful to the young lady
who brought Bob Dunn a chocolate rabbit. That completed the demolition
of the cops.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But not for Jack Rubenstein. Jack
is a striker, and an active boy, and the cops were out to get him if they
could. When hey piled us into the wagon to take us to Hackensack they put
handcuffs on us all. They put ordinary handcuffs on most of us, but on
Jack they screwed them tight. His wrist went white, and he couldn&#8217;t move
his hand, but the cops just grinned. &#8220;Aw, shut up,&#8221; they told him. When
they took him off at Hackensack there was a red groove around his wrist
a quarter of an inch deep.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That&#8217;s how I got to Hackensack as
the guest of the sheriff of Bergen County. And the best joke of all (the
joke I may say is entirely on me), is that it was from this very same county
that I enlisted in the army eight years ago under the picturesque illusion
that I was fighting for democracy.</font>

He was faithful at the meetings and on the picket line. He was a fellow

of the workers. The abuse and the clubbing that he was so used to in many
assaults upon him and the thousands of pickets who have braved the outrages
of a brutal police and a more brutal officialdom never deterred him from
going with the rest of the workers whenever needed. How much he was clubbed
the afternoon before his death and how much that contributed to his untimely
death is still to be determined.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It must also be remembered that he
was a hard working man, always doing more than his share in order to earn
enough to keep his family. He is among those who gave up his life to the
greed of the masters who gave him such starvation wages that he could not
things necessary to keep him strong and healthy. In addition to the low
wages he had to endure the unsanitary conditions in the mills where life
is always in jeopardy. All of this contributed to make out of a strong
man another victim of death.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No wonder he went out with the rest
when the strike was called, and did all in his power to win the strike
in order that his children may have a better chance at life.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We bow our heads in commemoration
of a working mans life that was too swiftly cut off by the greed of the
unfeeling bosses.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The funeral was one of the largest
in the history of Passaic and shows what solidarity of the workers means
in life as well as in death.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The sympathy of the 16,000 strikers

"Mills will open tomorrow.&#8221; Or &#8220;the mills will open Monday.&#8221; Or &#8220;the mills
are running and the workers are going back.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All these fresh news are standing
in type and are used to thrill the bosses with. These daily papers certainly
can amuse themselves with simple toys. If they ever get glum or lose their

are going to open tomorrow.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And the funny part of it is that
these serious editions think the workers are not hearing about whether
the mills are open or closed. This news does not interest the strikers.
The bosses can keep the mills open all day and night and Sundays. They
can open the gates and the doors and the windows and the roofs and the
walls and the cellars and the wash rooms and the spinning rooms and the
toilets and the whole caboodle.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nobody hinders them. They can hire
all the scabs they want to and Col. Johnson and Julius Forstmann and all
the bosses in the whole swill barrel can go in and go to work.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The more you fuss the more it costs
you and the sooner you will come to time.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But one thing is sure and that is
that you cannot run the mills and produce clothes as long as we, the workers,
do not go to work. And we are not going to work until we win the strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Just open your mills all you want
to and let the papers print your old stuff as news but you cannot fool

Constitution.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This injunction &#8220;enjoins and restrains&#8221; persons from &#8220;consulting&#8221; with an employee from the complaining firm. Since

That is an order that no judge and lawmaking body has any right to issue.
It is in violation of the constitution.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The workers are enjoined and restrained
from &#8220;advising or consulting with, or encouraging any striking employees
of complainant and from contributing money or advice to said strikers or
toward the success of said strike.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Does this judge not know that it
is legal to strike, and that it is legal to picket peacefully? Why does
he issue an injunction against hat which is entirely legal? Many people
will want to know. What will he answer them?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Will he say that the workers shall
go back to the hell holes they came out of? Does he want to assist in injuring
the cause of the workers? Does he consider that the demands of the strikers
are not just? Would he try to drive them back to work at $10, $12, $15
a week? Does he want to injure the business of the workers?</font>

up the peaceable meeting at Garfield when Norman Thomas was arrested. There
was a good crowd of strikers there and New York sympathizers. And Donaldson
and his shotgun force, with a lot of Garfield policemen for good measure.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thomas climbed a dead apple tree
to speak from. He said it was a legal meeting; that the lot had been rented

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Donaldson and the shotguns listened
but didn&#8217;t start rioting yet.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Later that day we heard how the police

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The Company Union
and the Young Workers</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The company union is formed by the
bosses to keep the workers from organizing into a real workers union, and
at the same time it makes them feel that they are organized. The constitutions
of these so-called unions are such that they are simply lickspittles of
the bosses. When the workers do try to form a union and go ahead on strike,
they use this &#8220;union&#8221; as a strike breaking agency.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The needs of the workers, young and
old, is more wages, shorter hours, and more sanitary conditions. These
are achieved through the struggle of the real union, and what more these
union workers gain in self-respect, and self-reliance in the struggles
through these conditions.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The company union on the other hand
not only kills in the worker that feeling of self-reliance and self-respect
but it also makes the workers better and more willing slaves. Hand in hand
with company unions go the speed up system called &#8220;efficiency production.&#8221; To the workers it is known as the bonus system, piece work, and time-rate
work or by some other similar name. All this is for the sake of increasing
the bosses profit.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The company unions are especially
detrimental to the young workers. The young workers get extra service in
getting their self-respect killed by this kind of bosses union. It offers
them plenty of dances, hikes and excursions, baseball, football, soccer
and every other sport. It offers him magazines and newspapers especially
edited for them, containing plenty of jokes. On holidays, speakers tell
these young workers how they can become presidents of the concern by working
hard and faithfully and similar bunk. All of this tends to make the young
worker dull and stupid.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sport that is to develop the body
becomes a thing that diverts the minds of the young workers from their
working class interests. The little leisure time that the young workers
have is used solely and of course this is offered by the company union.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While a real worker&#8217;s union tries
to develop its young members by pushing them forward, giving them a chance
to study and learn things. It makes them fight for the demands of the union
and for the special demands of the young workers and thereby develops the
self-respect and self-reliance. The company union takes special efforts
to see that the young workers have plenty of amusements and nothing else
during his leisure time. The young workers are usually not given a chance
to work on any of the important committees of the company union. The company
union pushes forward to the responsible positions only those whom they
are sure to control. These are usually trained stool pigeons and spies
and those who are willing to become traitors for a petty job.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The young workers are usually more
honest and sincere. They are not yet spoiled much by the bosses propaganda
and for this reason they are kept in the background. All in all it is now
the duty of each young worker to fight against these fake unions and get
into a real workers union that will fight for better conditions for the
young and old workers.</font>

instead he took two rotten apples from the wagon. Just then my bus passed

the rotten part he got sore and threw it into the sewer. He must have been
very hungry that morning and it was time for lunch to be served, and the
Gera mill was too far off. He did not pay for the apples but went away.

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Well half an hour has passed. Back
come three more detectives, chase everybody out of the office and start

He tells us, &#8220;Stand firm, hold the fort, don&#8217;t give in to those parasite
bosses.&#8221; Who wouldn&#8217;t stay out for a man like that? Our answer to Weisbord
is: We will stay out on strike not only until they give in to our 7 demands
but until they release him.</font>

Why, while a meeting was going on in the Russian Hall, a meeting for the
strikers of the Gera Mill, New Jersey Spinning and Passaic Worsted, a woman
stands up in the audience and makes a motion to buy flowers for Weisbord,
$33 was collected. A big basket of flowers was bought for $10, the rest
turned over to the relief fund. When these flowers were brought to him
in jail, the police court would not give them to him.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Three cheers for Weisbord&#8212;Hurrah!,
Hurrah!, Hurrah!</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are helping with the relief work
in the office of the Passaic Textile Strikers and to think that this is
the twelfth week of the strike. It is wonderful to see the relief that
comes in every day from all over the country just as strong, if not stronger
than even it was at the beginning of the strike. It is most encouraging
to read the letters praising the struggling strikers in their efforts to
get a decent living for themselves and for their children.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Another Fool King</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Once upon a time there was a king
who was very proud and very stupid.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And there arose difficulties in his
kingdom between the barons and the slaves and there was much and bitter
struggle between them.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now it came to pass that the slaves
had chosen a leader to help them carry on the struggle against the barons
who had become too cruel to the common people, and who had decreased the
substance whereupon the laborers had to live until there was little left
but starvation.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the barons would not give the
slaves what they had need of to live, they said among themselves, &#8220;We shall
rather starve to death fighting for bread than starve in the mills while
working for the lords.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And behold!, for thirteen weeks the
slaves refused to work and their leader instructed them and said, &#8220;If you
stick together and organize into a solid union, you will be able to force
the barons to give you the things necessary for you to live upon.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then a great cry arose from the throats
and bellies of the fat barons and they went unto the king and said unto
him, &#8220;Help us get the slaves back to work or we have to go to work ourselves.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And the king hearkened unto the gurly
voice of the barons and called upon his general and his soothsayers and
bade them come and help him get the barons out of the hell of a hole they
had gotten themselves into.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the slaves heard thereof they
answered and said, &#8220;We are always ready to meet with the king and any or
all his generals and soothsayers and with the barons themselves and although
you come to us with war horses and enemies of peace to talk to us about
peace, we still forgive you and hold ourselves in readiness to meet in
a peaceable way you and your committee.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then the king spake and said unto
them: &#8220;I am a mighty potentate in my kingdom and have the power of life
and death over my subjects, and I therefore command you to eliminate from
your peace committee your leader, though he be neither a soldier nor a
prizefighter for I fear him greatly, because he might show both you, the
slaves, and my own generals of war how stupid I am and how humble I am
before the barons who are my masters though I make the people think I am
their king.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But the slaves answered and unto
their king, &#8220;[Lo] for these thirteen weeks our leader has been with us
and he is a kind man and honest and he will in no wise hurt even so much
as the skin of your nose or of your little finger. We want him with us
and he will help us settle the difficulties we have with the barons.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And the king said unto them, &#8220;Always
when I negotiate for peace between my armies and the armies of the enemy
I stipulate first of all that I shall retain all my generals but that the
generals of the other army must be killed before I proceed to talk peace.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whereupon the slaves made long noses
at him and said: &#8220;You are a coward and a [weakling] and no damn good king.&#8221;</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thousands of union cards waved in
the air in Wallington at the huge mass meeting on the 26<sup>th</sup> of
April. It was the beginning of a union drive. This union drive showed the
will of the strikers. All day long, files of new union members stood at
headquarters getting their union cards and in all the halls where cards
were obtainable files of strikers waited. At the beginning of the fifteenth
week of the strike, on the one hundreth day of the strike, more union members
were enrolled than in any other one day. Hundreds of strikers got union
cards. Peace talk was in the air. Two negotiating committees were in the
field, beside the one in Lodi.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The emphasis on union has grown throughout
the strike. The cry for union, union, union, is like the beating of a heart
among the strikers. Anyone who comes to headquarters knows that there are
always people waiting for their union cards around the table. There are
always people buying the union stamps.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the beginning of the fifteenth
week of the strike there are 10,000 people enrolled in the unions, 10,000
men and women in Passaic and vicinity bent on making a union permanent,
10,000 men and women filled with the spirit of solidarity.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One hundred per cent is what the
strikers want. With settlement approaching, everybody who has not joined
the union is hurrying to get a union card to have a voice in the settlement.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fourteen weeks have come and gone
since the strike started. Every week has had seven days and the strikers
have been at meetings almost every day. They have heard about the union.
They have been informed what a union means. How much they can do with a
union. How weak they are without a union.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is a new light in their eyes.
There is a new intelligence in their eyes. They recognize that there is
no hope for them without a union. They recognize that there is all the
hope in the world with a union.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is a great discovery. They had
discovered nothing like it before in all their lives. They realize what
a union will bring them. No longer will they have to stoop to the feet
of the bosses. No longer will they have to take the insults from the foremen.
Now they will be able to speak, to protest against wrongs, against wage
cuts, against being fired. Now they will be able to stand erect as men
and women.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So they have decided to have one
hundred percent union. They want every worker in the union. There must
be no workers outside the union. All must be in the union and be loyal
to the union. All must build up the union and make it a power and a great
aid.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Already they have won much because
they have been organized. They have withstood the whole series of attacks
by the bosses. They have withstood all the brutalities of the police and
the judges and the sheriffs and the gun men. They have kept the shops free
from scabs and held the mill barons at bay. They have run the relief service
and their meeting halls and carried on their strike in a most marvelous
manner. Already the whole world of labor respects them and every organized
worker welcomes them.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is inspiration in the union.
All meet on the same footing in the union. All nationalities meet there.
All races meet there. The Polish workers are one with the Hungarian workers,
the Russian with the Italian, the colored workers are one with the white
workers&#8212;all in the Union of workers, all strong in the one big Textile
Union.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Over ten thousand already are in
the union. The other workers must come now. The workers in Passaic and
in Garfield and in Lodi and in Clifton who have not signed up must come
now. All must be in the union when this strike is settled.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Come, brother and sister, if you
have not signed up, and join the mighty ranks. Come and be one of this
mighty and victorious throng.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Union! The Union! The Union!
One hundred per cent UNION!</font>

<p><b><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Sheriff Nimmo
is Driven From Belmont Park in Disgrace</font></font></em></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Little King of Bergen County Sprawls
All Over as Throne Totters</font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Garfield came back from Czarist Siberia.
It is in the United States again. Believers in civil liberty won. The strikers
won.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It all happened on the afternoon
of April 30, at Belmont Hall where no meetings had been held since little
Tsar Nimmo read the Riot Act on April 12.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Little Tsar Nimmo was ready to repeat
his illegal act. But the disciplined, orderly textile strikers gave him
no excuse or provocation. Two abreast they &#8220;picketed&#8221; Belmont Hall, assured
by their leaders that a meeting would be held that afternoon and a full
test made of little Tsar Nimmo&#8217;s shotgun riot law.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The test was arranged by the American
Civil Liberties Union and directed by its officials and attorneys John
Larkin Hughes, Forrest Bailey, Charles Joseph, Robert Dunn and others.
The speaker of the afternoon who was instructed to talk no matter what
the orders of Nimmo or his underlings was the Rev. John Haynes Holmes of
New York City. Rev. Holmes had purchased a one way ticket to Passaic and
was prepared if Nimmo lost his head again, to spend the night in the Garfield
lock-up or the Hackensack jail. A contract had been signed between the
Civil Liberties Union and Magyar Ladies and Gentlemen&#8217;s Association, owners
of Belmont Hall. The contract provided that the manager of the hall should
open it for a meeting. Rev. Holmes and his friends arrived to speak, but
at the same moment word came that Attorney Hughes had just obtained an
injunction restraining Nimmo &amp; Co. from interfering with this and all
other assemblies held in Garfield. It was decided to wait for the injunction
to be served.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was a long wait. Outside the thousands
of strikers slowly moved up and down laughing in the faces of the $10-a-day
bought-and-paid-for deputies of the Forstmann &amp; Huffmann Company.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nimmo himself commanded the operations
of his gunmen for a while. When the crowd cheered the arrival of Dr. Holmes
and Norman Thomas the little man nearly went out of his mind again. He
jumped on the porch of the hall, fumbled in his pocket for the riot act
and threatened to read it again. A suitcase full of gas bombs was opened
and lay ready at his side. The strikers, not wishing to encourage the little
Tsar to act the fool again, fell back quietly while the sheriff cooled
off.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Earlier in the afternoon his temper
had boiled over as he stormed through the rooms adjoining Belmont Hall,
trying to bulldoze and intimidate the fearless manager of the hall. &#8220;If
you open this hall I&#8217;ll arrest you at once. Contract or no contract, I&#8217;m
givin&#8217; orders here.&#8221; And so on. The little man is a great raver. But he
couldn&#8217;t scare the strikers or the Magyar Ladies and Gentleman&#8217;s Association!</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And the crowd kept on waiting, slowly
walking up and down River Road. Strike leaders moved among them assuring
them the meeting would be held&#8212;to keep on stickin&#8217; around.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Inside the beer parlor of Belmont
Hall sat the liberal friends from New York and nearby towns. Representatives
of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, the League for
Industrial Democracy, the Methodist Social Service Federation, a member
of the British Parliament, interested attorneys and publicists, members
of the Community Church and the Civil Liberties Union. They waited for
the signal for Dr. Holmes to do his stuff and for the injunction to arrive
from Jersey City.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Finally it came. Attorney Hughes
jumped from a car and hurried toward under-sheriff John Donaldson. Nimmo
had disappeared from the scene.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Donaldson&#8217;s lips trembled as he regarded
Mr. Hughes. He refused to put out his hand for the proffered document.
Mr. Hughes stuck it under his arm.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Who are you? I don&#8217;t know your name,&#8221; came from Donaldson.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I&#8217;m an attorney and this an injunction.
Read it,&#8221; answered Mr. Hughes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Slowly it dawned upon the bulky under-sheriff
that the strikers and their supporters had beaten him. He read the words
which directed him and his chief to refrain from ---"molesting, interfering
with, harassing, arresting,&#8221; or &#8220;threatening to arrest…… the complainants….."or
"any striking worker in said strike or any sympathizer therewith in the
lawful exercise of his….. constitutional rights of….. freedom of speech
and lawful assembly.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The workers, cheering, pressed toward
the hall. After stalling awhile and arresting the first worker who opened
the doors, Donaldson capitulated and ordered the armed gunmen to fall back.
The thousands of singing strikers were rewarded for their long wait. Into
the hall they swept packing it to the rafters. They sang four songs at
once. They called for Weisbord.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The committee in charge of the meeting
answered that call. Weisbord and Elizabeth Gurly Flynn were summoned from
headquarters.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">They had been waiting there three
long hours. Instructed by the Civil Liberties Union to keep out of the
free speech fight, they had stayed in the office and the minutes passed
more s1owly for them because they were off the battle line.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But now they were called in to enjoy
the victory. With a roar they were welcomed to the hall and to the platform.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">First, however, Rev. Holmes spoke,
telling the strikers of their magnificent strike and this splendid victory
for law and order. &#8220;You do not stand alone in your struggle,&#8221; he said,
"and while the entire country looks on, and the entire working class is
waiting for the final word, you must stand together until victory is won.&#8221; Dr. Holmes scored the police atrocities and the unconstitutional acts of
Nimmo and his crew.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Robert Dunn and Forrest Bailey of
the Civil Liberties Union told the strikers they had won Garfield and that
they must keep it till the strike is won. Attorney Hughes and Joseph emphasized
the importance of the rights won by the workers through their 100% solidarity
and strength, and Norman Thomas recounted the story of his speech on the
apple tree and his arrest a few days previous.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gurley Flynn told the workers they
had taken the American flag out of jail, pointing at the red-white-and-blue
banner given to the strikers months ago by the local Post of the American
Legion, &#8220;but I noticed that the American Legion, which gave it to us, did
nothing to get it out.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then Albert Weisbord amid shouts
announced the meetings to be held in Garfield every day until the strike
is won and thanked the &#8220;outsiders&#8221; for the part they had played in restoring
free assemblage to the Garfield workers. He also thanked the owners of
Belmont Hall for their cooperation and courage in the face of the threats
of the Forstmann and Huffmann tools, Nimmo and his men.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The sheriff was called in here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to maintain law and order. He did it with rifles and satchels
of gas bombs, with riot acts and illegal arrests. He has failed to break
the ranks of the workers. His offensive is broken. This meeting marks the
beginning of his retreat and the end of his reign of terror. Beginning
tomorrow we shall meet daily in Garfield and our strike will be stronger
than ever.&#8221;</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The management of Belmont Hall stood
up like men against the little sawed off sheriff with his sawed off riot
guns in the day of real battle. The strikers appreciate the courage of
these men who faced jail for a principle and never flinched.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Steve Huebner, president, Joseph

to work thirteen long hours, on the night shift and I worked ten hours

was a weaver on three looms. When I did make a pretty fair pay they docked
me off no matter if it was necessary or not.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Once they gave out a Christmas present

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Chancellor John Bently rendered his
decision on the Forstmann-Huffmann injunction Thursday and modified it
so as to permit peaceful picketing which makes it possible for the strikers
to go ahead as before, since they have never attempted to violate any law
in their strike duties.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is a sweeping victory for the
strikers and is an evidence of the fact that organization means power.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The record of the strikers as peaceful

is known far and wide and the judge realized that the rights of the strikers
had to be upheld as far as he could.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>How the Twelve Loom
System was Put Over in the Arlington Mills</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It happened about a year ago when
work was very slow throughout the city of Lawrence, when the workers were
trying to fight off starvation, that the bosses hit upon this happy plan
of taxing the strength of the workers to their limit and sapping some more
profits out of them for the mill owners. And if the bosses could put it
through it would mean that they would meet with favor in the eyes of the
officials higher up.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As I was working there then, I had
a chance to observe how the plan was put into effect. There was one worker,
a young weaver who came every morning and noon looking for work. This weaver
was down and out. He didn&#8217;t know where the next meal was coming from. Then
one morning the overseer called that weaver over and gave him some sweet
talk on running twelve looms, promising the best of work and a standing
weekly wage (almost a living wage according to the government figures).
The weaver being at the starvation point was forced to accept this proposition.
After getting the looms going, this weaver was watched for a short time.
The overseer became convinced that it was possible to run that number of
looms. He called another weaver and put the same preposition before him.
This continued for some time until the system was fully introduced. Thus
the workers, because of poverty and unemployment and because they are not

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A price list was put up on the twelve
loom basis. It amounted to a fraction more than half of the six loom basis.
The bosses profits however, doubled. The workers have to work twice as
hard but get paid one half of what they used to. Because of the speed up
systems, because the bosses care for profits only, hundreds of workers
are forced out in the streets knocking about for work.</font>

have all of a sudden decided to educate us the workers of the mill. Several
weeks ago we were told that unless we attend the classes given at lunch

with our jobs.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After sacrificing our lunch hours
for several weeks what have we learned? We learned that this is a free

and jailed while they are peacefully assembled or while they are peacefully
picketing.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lodi is a town partly owned but completely
controlled by the United Piece Dye Works. The own the dye works which is
the main source of income of the Lodi population. And through the ownership
of the mill, they own the labor power of 3,500 workers out of a population
amounting to less than 10,000. Their control extends to everything worth
controlling&#8212;especially the mayor, the priest, the local sheet, &#8220;Lodi
Bulletin&#8221; and the judge. The latter is employed as a foreman in the mill.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This one-mill town and almost company
town is now the scene of a splendid labor struggle. The 3,500 slaves of
the dye house have come to their own. Men and women, young and old, black
and white, Italian and Pole, have lined up in back of the six demands including
recognition of the union. None of the tricks played by the company have
so far succeeded in weakening the solidarity of the strikers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An army of spies of different races
and nationalities, employed by the company is at work. Their success in
persuading strikers to go back to work is zero. They have succeeded in
getting a few to go back, but these few remain at work only until they
are visited by strikers and told that when the union men go back to work
the scabs will have to get out.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The workers of Lodi know what they
want and know how to get it. The mill is crippled and the company is not
making any profits. Lodi will soon be redeemed from a company town into

Action</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">John Sherman, of full age, having
duly sworn, according to law, on his oath deposes and says:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1. I now reside at 40 Spencer Place,
Garfield, N. J. I am a citizen of the United States, and I have lived in
Passaic and vicinity for 23 years.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. In September, 1919, I was employed
by Mr. Frank Andreas, secretary of the Industrial Council of Passaic Wool
Manufacturers, in the capacity of clerk, interpreter and investigator.
This Council of Passaic Wool Manufacturers included seven woolen mills
as follows:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Botany Worsted Mill, Forstmann and
Huffmann Company, Passaic plant; Forstmann &amp; Huffmann Company, Garfield
plant; Garfield Worsted Mills, Garfield N. J.; Gary Mills, Passaic N. J.;
New Jersey Worsted Spinning Company, Garfield N. J.; Passaic Worsted Spinning
Company, Passaic N. J.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3. The office of the Wool Council
at that time was on Lexington avenue, Passaic, N. J. and is now located
at 275 Monroe street, Passaic. My duties consisted of obtaining from applicants
for jobs full particulars concerning former occupation, why they left their
former jobs, how much they had been earning, description of the person
and habits of the person. This application with the said information was
then submitted to Mr. S. I. Szotkowski who was the manager of the Employment
[Bureau] of the Industrial Wool Council. The information which the bureau
required concerning an applicants previous record was obtained by sending
to his former employer [blank] known as Form No. 2 with the request that
they fill it out and return it. On the back of the application and the
information derived by means of Form No. 2 we would determine whether the
applicant was likely to be a trouble maker. If so, our instructions were
to refuse to give him an employment card. In 1925 and 1926, the method
was adopted of giving the applicant a card, but indicating by a secret
number system what objections there were to him or her. The employment
clerks at the various mills hired or refused to hire, depending upon the
code number which appeared on this card, known as Form 3.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4. I know that each of the members
of the Wool Council had detectives and spies in the mills who were charged
with the duty of watching the employees and talking to them, and of reporting
to the management any actions or language which might indicate the possibility
of his causing any trouble. These detectives and spies were especially
instructed to report any person who complained about his wages or working
conditions, whether he ever mentioned forming a union, whether he worked
steadily at his machine, whether he had any ill-feeling towards the company,
whether he was a crank on the labor question, whether the machines were
kept running to the fullest capacity, whether favoritism was shown to any
employees by the foreman, etc. Whenever any person was discharged or left
his job of his own accord, I would receive a report from the mill where
he had been employed setting forth by means of a code number the reason
or reasons why he or she had been dismissed or had left.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">5. If any person came to the office
of the Wool Council with a quit-card which did not indicate any reason
for his discharge, we were required to call up the mills he had left and
inquire why he had been discharged. After a man had once been dismissed
by one of the members of the Wool Council, and he again sought employment,
we would give him a card, but would indicate thereon in code what offence
or offences he had been charged with committing in the other mill or mills.
If any of the members of the Council were badly in need of help and a person
applied for a job whose card indicated that his or her record was not clear,
the mill would apply to the Council&#8217;s office for a full report of that
person&#8217;s activities during his or her employment in the various woolen
mills, which report we would furnish. If any person was guilty of any serious
infractions of the rules or policies of the member mills, it was virtually
impossible for him to obtain employment with any of the other member woolen
mills. No applicant for a job was ever accepted at any of these woolen
mills without a card from the Woolen Council.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">6. Many applicants who found it impossible
to obtain a job came to the office of the Wool Council and inquired for
the reasons for their being blacklisted. My instructions from my superiors
were never to admit any person that had been blacklisted. I was instructed
to make up my excuses in each case why the man or woman had been unable
to obtain a job.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">7. I was also charged with the duty
of investigator of finding out all that I could about persons who had never
worked in the woolen mills before. If there was any suspicion that the
applicant might possibly cause any trouble or influence other employees
or create dissatisfaction with wages or working conditions, my instructions
were to report unfavorably.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">8. The work of the Wool Council was
financed by the member mills, each contributing in proportion to the number
of employees. The staff in the office of the Wool Council consisted of
seven people. I was employed continuously from 1919 to 1926.</font>

Now you strikers don&#8217;t go back because there are ghosts in those mills

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sheriff Nimmo has reported to say
that things have quieted down. Everything has quieted down since he and
his armed deputies have left. The most violent thing that the strikers
know was the reading of the Riot Act by Sheriff Nimmo. The Riot Act states
persons may be arrested if they do not disperse within an hour. No sooner
had Sheriff Nimmo said the words &#8220;God save the State&#8221; and he shouted &#8220;clear
them out boys&#8221; and immediately began knocking down men and women and clubbing
the strikers and arresting people right and left.</font>

their tails between their legs.</font>

then you have decided upon it and that is all.</font>

workers individually. It is cowardly for you to say that. You will meet
one by one but you do not dare to meet with your workers as a union. The

as you have in the past.</font>

stubborn. We are ready to talk the matter over with you. We have always
been ready. It is your move next.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The Strike in Passaic
and in England</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is a strike in Passaic and
vicinity involving some 16,000 workers. There is a strike in England involving
over 5,000,000 workers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is a big difference in numbers,
but there is no difference in the cause of the strike and there is no difference
to the opposition to it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The cause of it here was hunger.
The cause of it in England is hunger. When the workers cannot live with
the miserable wages they get and the unendurable conditions the impose
upon them, they go on strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No outside agitator can come in and
call a strike. It is hunger and injustice that brings about a strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The miners in England have been hard
pressed for years. Last August a crisis came. A strike was threatened.
The government stepped in and paid the difference between what the miners
demanded and what the bosses were willing to pay.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now the government&#8217;s time is up.
During this period the miners were getting an average of $18 per week.
A cut of twenty to thirty-three and a third percent was made. This means
that the miners would now have to work for $12 to $15 a week. They said,
"we cannot do it. We would rather starve in the street striking than starve
in the mines working.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You heard something like that in
Passaic.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In England the government got out
its army and its guns&#8212;just like in Passaic. The government is with
the mine owners and against the workers&#8212;just as in Passaic.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The workers in England see the need
of organization and are fighting together as unions against the bosses
--- just as in Passaic.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>How Many Went Back?</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now if all the workers have gone
back to the mills that the bosses try to make us believe have gone back,
they would have twice as many working as the whole number now on strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And if the mills are running so swiftly
and beautifully, what are the bosses kicking about?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And if the mills are open why do
they have to set a [way] to open them?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And if the workers are all at work
why do they have to get out an injunction to keep the strikers from talking
to them and have the strike continue?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And if the workers are going back
why do you have to get the sheriffs to read the riot act?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And if the workers are all working
why do you have to …ese the halls and parks where the meetings are held
since nobody comes to the meetings?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And if all the strikers are back
in the mills where did the 10,000 who packed the lots in Wallington and
the 1,000 who got together in Lodi and the 2,000 who assembled in halls
come from?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gee! There must be a lot of people
in Passaic and all around who do not get into the mills. Maybe they do
not like to go into the mills. Maybe they do not fall for the gaff of the
bosses and the serious editors in Passaic.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Maybe they see the joke and maybe
they laugh at the news that the mills are open.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Its hard to tell just what&#8217;s going
on in the heads of these strikers who have started to think. And about
16,000 have started to think. And to Organize!</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Slavic Committee reports that
the bosses have slammed the door to mediation in their face. This Committee
has lost hope of settlement with the mill owners.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Slavic Committee has been especially
anxious to find an opportunity to negotiations. It is composed of sincere
and intelligent men. Judge Cabell has been at the head of it and has conducted
its work in all earnestness.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But the bosses would not listen.
They tell the Committee that there is no hope of getting them to talk to
the workers. For several weeks the workers and others have looked for better
results. The United Front Committee of Textile Workers has made it as easy
as possible for the bosses to meet them. Organizer Weisbord stepped aside
in order to leave no excuse for the owners. The bosses had indicated that
if he stepped aside they would come and talk things over.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now they balk. They have had fifteen
weeks of idle mills. They have had fifteen weeks of opportunity to show
what they will do. They have answered that they will do nothing.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Very well. The workers know what
to do. You cannot fool us. You cannot bluff us. We are right here a thousand
times stronger than we were fifteen weeks ago.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You, the mill owners, are not in
the very best position possible. You may not know it, but the entire community
is now getting quite tired of your stubborness.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Out of the sweat and blood of the
workers you have become fabulously rich. You have piled up fortunes for
yourselves and become powerful in your fortunes. You have accepted the
abundance created by the workers and grown mighty in your possessions.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And now you are paying us for all
this. You have already paid us&#8212;for many years you have paid us. You
have paid us in low wages and hard work and bad working conditions. You
have paid us in dirty hovels and broken down men and women. You have paid
us in tuberculosis and malnutrition. You have paid us in the highest death
rate in the state from your unsanitary mills. You have paid us in child
labor and stunted lives. You have paid us in night work for pregnant women
and in starvation wages for men.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You object when we want to organize
and protect ourselves. You will not even condescend to talk to us. You
feel pretty big&#8212;and pretty secure. You have faith in the goodness of
the workers&#8212;and in our ignorance. But you may find out that we are
not as ignorant as you imagine. We have been learning. For fifteen weeks
we have been learning. We have been learning what you would never teach
us. We have learned to organize.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And it is you who have driven us
to organize. You were so grasping that you took too much life out of us
while we were humbly working for you. The community around us was asleep
and did not know what you were doing till we went on strike and told the
reasons for our going on strike. We asked the preachers and the business
men and the welfare workers and the health bureaus to look for themselves.
They looked. They stood in horror. They had not been able to believe that
you paid us such miserable wages till they saw our pay envelopes. They
could not believe that you fingerprinted us till we showed them our work
cards.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">They stood in horror. They stand
in horror yet. They swear that this shall not continue. They stand by our
side and fight. They have helped us to get a check upon your Cossacks.
They have helped us to drive the sheriffs out of town. They have helped
us to mediate. They surely thought you would meet with them. But you have
insulted them as you have insulted us. Now they see who you are and what
you are. In all your nakedness and shame they see you.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Judge Cabell and the Slavic committee
comes out to raise a cry for the strikers. They see the justice of our
cause. They will help us to arouse this entire community and shake it to
its very foundations.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The unions all over this country
are backing us in our fight. They have sent support for us during the fifteen
weeks. They will send support to us till we win. The workers of America
have helped us feed the strikers and give them all they need. We have kitchens
for children who tell us that they get more and better food than ever before
in their lives while their parents were slaving in your mills and getting
your starvation wages.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We knew when we went out on strike
that you would go the limit. We figured on that and prepared for it. Now
we hurl our challenge at you. We have justice on our side. What have you:&#8217;
You have the contempt of every right thinking man and woman in the world.
You have earned it. You are earning more of it. You can quit earning it
and start on the better road. Will you do that?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We call your bluff. You cannot fool
us. We know your game. We defy your obstinacy. We will fight on till we
win.</font>

<p><b><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Rubinstein and
Miller Cases Dismissed by Justice Parker</font></font></em></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another evidence of the lawlessness
of the Garfield and Passaic authorities as well as the constantly increasing
power of the mighty union of the textile workers came to light when Justice
Parker of Trenton dismissed the charges against Jack Rubenstein and Clarence
Miller last Friday.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rubinstein and Miller were held under
$10,000 bail when first arrested for participating in the strike, but this
bail was reduced to $1,000 under which these fellow workers were at liberty.
The police of Passaic and Garfield trumped up such charges that when Judge
Parker saw them he said:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I conclude that on the face of the
papers before me these men are not legally charged with a criminal offense:
they will accordingly be discharged and the bail exonerated.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The bosses went too far when they
ordered their cops and their other tools to slam the jail door on the workers.
Every time they perpetrated one of their nasty deeds the strikers grew
stronger and the union added more members, until now the power of the workers
is recognized and the authorities are looking at the whole matter in a
more logical way.</font>

work straight through for at least eleven hours and forty minuets, without
a lunch hour as we are expected to call when we get a chance during working

we steam up to boiling point, then put in one quart of phosphate of lime

we have to handle it without protection.</font>

<p><b><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Where Ladies
Have to Work</font></font></em></b>
<br /><b><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>By Katharine
H. Amend</font></font></em></b></center>
<font size=+1></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I&#8217;ve traveled a lot&#8212;New York
and Hartford and Rhode Island and even Philadelphia&#8212;but I tell you,
hones&#8217; to God, I never saw no place where ladies have got to work like
they do here. Lots of places ladies work sometimes,&#8212;maybe they have
just one or two kids and they can leave &#8216;em with their mother or his mother
so they can work and get ahead a bit,&#8212;but here in Passaic they have
got to work. My sister here worked when she was expecting with her eighth
and was that big that she couldn&#8217;t hardly reach round herself. That&#8217;s hard,
too, when you re that way, stretching and reaching and standing on your
feet ten hours without stopping even to eat your san&#8217;wiches. She had a
real good foreman at the last and he used to pretend not to see if she
stayed a few minutes in the toilet to rest. God knows she had to be pretty
tired to stay long in the toilet at the Botany. Smells and water on the
floor and dirt! But the other foreman&#8212;why, he&#8217;d yell at her not to
stop when she was tryin&#8217; to eat.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">She waved to a passer-by and then
resumed:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"And she did her housework, too,
mind you. Come home and get him up and something to eat and the kids clean
for school and feed the little ones and make the beds and get the dinner.
Then maybe she&#8217;d lay down a bit in her clothes with the babies on the bed
back of her till the big girl got home from school. Olga was eleven and
could do pretty good, cook the supper, you know, so my sister could sleep
till she had to go back to the mill at seven. It ain&#8217;t right but I ask
you what she could do? Her husband, countin&#8217; slack time couldn&#8217;t get more
than twenty-seven a week and you know with shoes and rent and all you just
can&#8217;t get along on that. That&#8217;s what I say&#8212;here ladies have got to
work. I ain&#8217;t a striker myself&#8212;my husband, he&#8217;s a cook&#8212;but I go
on the picket line every day. His people are all in it and it ain&#8217;t right,
so it ain&#8217;t. Working like that&#8212;you know,&#8212;all the life goin&#8217; out
of you to earn a living, that ain&#8217;t a living. Horses couldn&#8217;t work that
way. I ask you, ain&#8217;t it right if you put all you can into a job to be
able to get enough to live so you got strength to go on working? My sister-in-law
ain&#8217;t been in the church even at Easter for two years and I guess now she
don&#8217;t care if she ever goes again. Some of these priests ain&#8217;t for the
people. They say, &#8216;Go back and then talk it over&#8217;. But my sister-n-law
she&#8217;s lived like a dog that long that she says no hell can&#8217;t be worse and
she&#8217;ll starve till they go back with the union. Some think it would be
good to go back if they wouldn&#8217;t take off the ten per cent but my sister-in-law
says the bosses would just take it next month and they would be starving
for nothing now. No, ma&#8217;am, where ladies have got to work like they do
here nothing can&#8217;t be worse.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Excuse me a minute. Angela, what
did you come out here today? You ain&#8217;t going to help the strike by getting
pneumonia.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Angela, little and black-eyed, protested,
"I don&#8217;t want to miss the parade.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For conversation I said, &#8220;Won&#8217;t the
truant officer get you if you stay out of school?&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The argumentative picketer and the
small girl exchanged grins at a stranger&#8217;s ignorance.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Angela doesn&#8217;t go to school. She&#8217;s
fifteen and her mother&#8217;s feet have give out. Somebody&#8217;s got to work and
her father is dead two years and there are two other little kids. Her father
was in the dye works and standing in the hot steam and the wet floors and
going home afterwards in the cold seemed to go to his lungs. His street
clothes had to hang in the steam, too, you know, and he wasn&#8217;t ever dry.
Angela here works cleaning needles. That ain&#8217;t so damp but she has to stoop
all day and it makes her back ache so she can&#8217;t hardly unbend when its
night.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"What hard work!&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Angela herself volunteered, &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
the work that’s so hard&#8212;it’s the leaning and the dust. But the very
worst is the bugs&#8212;big, black wood-bugs. I hate them&#8212;and the roaches.
They smell so and they go so fast and sometimes they crawl up your skirts.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These stories are not exceptions
as I, Thomas-like, had believed when I heard them from others. They are
a part of an overwhelming serfdom forced on helpless people within fifteen
miles of the prodigal luxury of Fifth Avenue. This women who had traveled
much&#8212;even to Philadelphia&#8212;had the instincts of a publicity agent
but in her eagerness to prove her points she used material that a professional
would have had to pass by with regrets.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For example, there was an Italian
woman. Pressure must be truly terrible to drive a middle-aged Italian woman
to public revolt and the picket line. She had the face of a person dead
a thousand years, yellow skin drawn too tight over a thin nose and hard
cheek-bones, temples sunken and eyes helpless, hopeless. Editors would
label a photograph of her a fake and refuse it. Angela told me that she
supports five children by her night work. Driven every moment by a foreman,
by the need to cook, to sew, to clean, never rested, sucked dry of every
feeling but desire to sleep, she is still unable to make enough to care
for her hungry brood.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Her English is very scant but it
hardly needed Angela&#8217;s interpretation to supplement the gestures that accompanied
her words as she told her bitter story, ending with the crowning woe that
she had not even been able to stop to drink coffee with her midnight bread
and cheese.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The foreman he yell, &#8220;You Godamsonabeech,
what for you stop that machine?&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A wise soul once said that there
is no successful agitator but injustice and anyone who wants to find out
why there is a strike in Passaic in the textile mills, needs only to ask
those who stand in the picket lines in this town where ladies have got
to work.</font>

<p><b><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Mills Try Company
Union Trick</font></font></em></b>
<br /><b><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>By Robert Dunn</font></font></em></b></center>
<font size=+1></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Company unions in the textile industry
increased from four in 1919 to 28 in 1924. Not only concerns such as Forstmann-Huffmann
Co. cotton manufacturing companies north and south have used the company
union weapon against the trade union.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Notable among southern mills using
the John Leitch Plan (house of representatives, senate and cabinet) is
the Riverside &amp; Dan River Cotton Mills of Danville, Va. Workers in
its mills sign a pledge binding them to the company&#8217;s policy of &#8220;Justice,
Cooperation, Energy and Service.&#8221; The workers have upon several occasions
voted themselves substantial reductions in wages, As a result of this Company
union, the United Textile Workers locals in Danville were forced into liquidation!
Durham Hosiery&#8217;s company union plan went under in a wave of unemployment
accompanied by a 43% wage reduction.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Under the trade union, a skilled
dresser tender or beamer averaged $32-$35 for a 48 hour week. Today the
same class of workers toils 54 hours and receives a minimum of $18 and
a maximum of $28. The new processes introduced with the &#8220;inside plan&#8221; of
agent Parker Straw to save the company money divides the workers into four
grades, the majority being put in the lower grades.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Loomfixers who formerly mended 60
looms and received an average of $37.50 per week now care for 90 looms
of the same type and receive $10 less per week, or an average of $27,50
per week. Weavers of ginghams formerly operated six looms. Now they run
10 and 12 with less pay for the 54-hour week than they formerly earned
in 48 hours in January 1922, before the plan was adopted. Worsted weavers
who formerly ran two looms now run six and get from $4 to $8 less per week
in wages.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Pacific Mills in Lawrence, similarly
have used their &#8220;advisory&#8221; employee representation plan, which serves to
distract workers while wage cuts are put over. Under the Pacific plan,
the workers lack even the right to cast a ballot on wage reductions. Under
some company unions the management permits a ballot, but acts according
to its own desires.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A Pacific Mills executive recently
explained that the company was gradually ridding itself of &#8220;labor disturbances&#8221; by the use of the plan. One trick employed in introducing the plan was
to pay the workers committee&#8217;s expenses on an &#8220;investigation tour&#8221; through
the plants of the General Electric Co. and the United States Rubber Co.
"Of course&#8221; the executive explained. &#8220;We sent them to the mills where we
knew they would see what we wanted them to see.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Trade union officials in the Pacific
write that &#8220;the company union is regarded as a Big Joke by many workers.&#8221; The union has members but not recognition in the mill. The company&#8217;s welfare
work is confused in the workers minds</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">with the company union, trade unionists
admit. The company tries to sell the company union on the basis of hospitals,
sanitary arrangements, benefit associations, and other welfare features
given irrespective of the company union. &#8220;Then the company wants to put
over radical changes the council has not a word to say,&#8221; the trade unionists
state. They conclude that &#8220;it is up to the workers to organize and ignore
the company union.&#8221;</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">*********************************************</font>
<p><b><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Injunction Permits
Picketing</font></font></em></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The permanent injunction which the
Forstmann and Huffmann Co. was finally able to obtain is an exceedingly
barren victory, for the mill owners. One of the local newspapers calls
the injunction almost as sweeping as the original restraining order. In
reality nothing could be farther from the truth. The permanent injunction
makes a mockery of the original restraining order.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The restraining order forbade picketing;
the permanent injunction permits picketing, and although only eight pickets
are allowed at each gate, frequent changing of pickets is not restrained.
The restraining order forbade any mention of the strike. The permanent
injunction permits peaceful persuasion, going to the extent of saying affirmatively
that it is the intention of the court that the strikers may peacefully
persuade workers from going to work.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The court states not only that there
is a strike in the Forstmann and Huffmann Mill, not only that the overwhelming
number of employees of Forstmann and Huffmann are still on strike at the
time of issuance of the injunction, but that the strikers are singularly
free from acts of violence, and consequently the permanent injunction that
was issued is but a formal document which merely prevents by injunction
what the criminal law already prevented. Of course the union will not sanction
strikers throwing bombs and other criminal acts of violence which the injunction
restrains. They have not done so in the past as the court itself points
out and they will not do so in the future.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We anticipate that the police in
their eagerness to serve the mill owners will try to put many more restrictions
upon the pickets than the court itself does. The United Front Committee
of Textile Workers desires to affirm now that the strikers will stand firm
in maintaining their rights which the court has defined. We shall not be
moved away from the mill gates. We shall not be told how to picket just
as long as we picket peacefully and orderly and come within the terms of
the injunction. We shall protect our workers who are molested by the agents
of the bosses by all means within out power. We wish to point out also
to the [overzealous] police that they not entitled to arrest anybody except
those who violate the criminal law. The court itself may well take care

<p><b><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The Night Work
Abomination</font></font></em></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Night work by mothers is one of the
abominations against which the strikers are protesting in Passaic. It is
an abomination practically universal among the wool workers. Nearly every
mother tries it at some time or other, some alternating between night and
day shifts according to their capacity to stand the added strain, and the
needs of their families. The wide prevalence of such work may be observed
by the fact that one may stop at any house where the workers live, one
may knock at almost any door and one will find a worn out and weary woman
who before the strike was employed on the night shift.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sixty such women were questioned
recently as to the effects of such work on their health and on the welfare
of their children. Here are examples picked at random from the visitor&#8217;s
notes which show better than statistics why night work has been condemned
throughout the civilized world:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mrs. P. who lives in a miserable
tenement on 2<sup>nd</sup> street, has seven children. She lives in three
dark rooms, two of which are windowless and pays for them $15 rent. The
youngest child is fifteen and expects soon to go to work, the youngest
is two months old, Mrs. P. although twenty-three years in this country
speaks little English. All these years she has worked in the mills, slaving
in them as her babies came, and as soon after they were born as possible.
Her rooms are squalid and cluttered, unlike most Polish homes which are
usually spotless. Mrs. P. is too wearied and ill to clean house. All in
a heap she sat, one baby on her knees, and two others clinging to her skirts.
One white faced girl of nine, her eyes red from malnutrition interpreted
for her mother. With an apathy like hers, the child repeated the story
of low wages, insufficient food, an increasing family, and the necessity
of the mother&#8217;s working at night. Nothing perhaps is more tragic than the
faces of these long starved children. Even the babies of two or three reflect
the dreariness and misery that has surrounded them ever since they came
so unwanted into the world.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mrs. L. also has seven children,
ranging from four to fifteen. She earns $17 to $18 as a spinner on the
night shift. Her husband works from 2:30 daily to midnight, so that half
of each night, the children are left in the care of the fifteen year old
girl. On the day of the visit, the mother was drearily washing. The strike,
she said, had given her a little chance at night sleep, but always she
was &#8220;like dead person for tired.&#8221; Two or three of the younger children
stood dully about, their eyes staring with hunger. Another child was stealthily
eating from the frying pan on the stove. She would watch her mother furtively,
and then like a starved animal filch a bit of food. Her peculiarly sharpened
features, dead white cheeks and nose pinched and blue looked like the famine
pictures from China.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In one small cottage lived six night
working mothers. They were all congregated on the steps when the investigator
called and one by one they told their stories. Their stories were all the
same. Three, four, five, six, seven children, husband earning a pittance,
perhaps $18, perhaps $20 a week, perhaps only 27&cent;. The mother therefore
forced into the mill to stand for the long hours of the night and earn
at the end of five endless nights, $12, $15 or perhaps also only 27&cent;.
And by day, &#8220;how can sleep, with wash, with cook, with kids?&#8221; &#8220;Night work
hell for woman, but what can do?&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The following daily routine of a
night worker supplied by one woman is typical:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">She works as carder in the Botany
mill, the heaviest work imaginable. All night she stands, from seven o&#8217;clock
in the evening until five the following morning. She then returns to her
home, where six children, ranging in age from three to thirteen, and her
husband awaits her care. In exhaustion she &#8220;falls on the bed,&#8221; until six
o&#8217;clock she must get up, prepare for husband&#8217;s breakfast, get him off,
and then get three children ready for school. When they are gone, there
are still three younger ones to look after. For an hour or two she may
try desperately to get a little rest with them at play in the same room
with her, or even in bed, to keep them quiet. &#8220;But you know, baby no keep
still. All time call, Mama, get up.&#8221; Presently she staggers to her feet,
and sets about washing, or cleaning, or preparing something for the children
to eat who come home at noon from school. After dinner she may attempt
another nap, or abandoning any such hope, may continue her household duties
and oversight of her three children at home. Occasionally she says she
puts them in charge of the one of six and lets them play in the street
below. &#8220;But how I know while I try sleep, they [may] get kill from automobile.&#8221; Then comes the evening meal and [then] seven o&#8217;clock return to the carding
machine. By Saturday she says she &#8220;no can move from tired. Like horse must
work, but me no strong like horse.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One evil, universally recognized,
was the prevalence of pregnant women on the night shift. The coming of
a child is always a source of acute financial anxiety among Passaic workers,
and it is only natural that night work among mothers should increase at
such times. The practice is common also, of women working as near the birth
of their babies as possible, the foremen apparently making no objection
to women far advanced in pregnancy standing all night at a ring spinning
machine, or running up and down with a spinning mule. Three women told
of witnessing births of children in the mills, and several confessed to
having worked up to the day or night before their own babies arrived. Several
women ascribed the death or weakness of their children to the strain of
heavy mill work during pregnancy, but asked with the cynical shrug so common
among them, &#8220;What can do? One pay not enough.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These findings merely confirm those
of studies made for years which have discredited night work by women in
every civilized country in Europe. England has forbidden the practice since
1844, and fourteen other European nations repudiated it in 1906.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For years enlightened citizens in
New Jersey have tried to put New Jersey on at least as enlightened a plane
as the neighboring states of New York, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Massachusetts and Connecticut which forbid night work by women in manufacture.
In 1923, a night work law was actually put on the statute books of the
state, but the bosses, four of them members of the Wool Council of Passaic,
took advantage of a technical error in the drawing of the bill, to secure
a writ of certiorari restraining the law&#8217;s enforcement. Thus the abomination
continues.</font>

<p><b><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Lodi Hears Good
Speakers</font></font></em></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A woman&#8217;s meeting was held in Lodi
last week. It was the first meeting of the kind ever held there. It will
not be the last. Elisabeth Gurley Flynn and Arliano Magliacano who spoke
in Italian were the principal speakers. The women come to the woman&#8217;s meetings
and hear about the relation of women to strikes. They understand that Women
Win Strikes and that women lose strikes. A man cannot strike well if his
wife is scabbing at home. If his wife puts on a dreary face and says &#8220;Oh,
when is the strike going to be over?&#8221; every other minute it takes the heart
out of the man. There are very few women in Lodi and Passaic who do this.
The women who come to the woman&#8217;s meetings are the very backbone of the
strike. Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and Magliacano told the women not only to
go on the picket line with their husbands, but each one of them to make
up her mind that she would persuade ten other people to go.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"When you go to the store, when a
neighbor comes to see you, when you meet people on the street, talk to
them about the picket line. Persuade them to go. Keep the picket line in
your mind. In Lodi some people don&#8217;t go out on the picket line because
they&#8217;re afraid of what the neighbors will say. So many of us ought to go
out on the picket line that everybody will be afraid not to go for fear
of what the neighbors will say.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the woman&#8217;s meeting last week
in Passaic, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and Kate Gitlow were the speakers. There
is no better audience of all the fine audiences that gather daily than
that of the women. There is no audience more responsive. When you look
down into the sea of faces, at the good-looking young girls and the fine
middle aged women, the mothers of families, and the grandmothers, you realize
what a fighting spirit the textile workers have. This is the spirit that
wins the strikes, the spirit that brings the women to the meetings and
sends them out again to cheer up such women that are gloomy, to explain
the strike to those that are ignorant, and to check at the very beginning
any tendency to defeat the fight.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"For all the house to house visiting
that the bosses do, let their be twenty times as much house visiting by
the strikers.&#8221; When you looked at the [faces of] these women, you knew
that [each] one of them had made [up their] mind that she would [spend
many] hours of the day working [for] the strike and to win it.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Does the following recital of facts
sound like Siberia under the Czar, Italy under Mussolini, or the Congo
under the lash of the slave-driver?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thirteen thousand workers so wretchedly
underpaid that they live in chronic poverty without sufficient food, clothing,
medical care, of shelter, are given a 10 per cent wage cut by employers
who squeeze from 20 to [90] per cent annual profits from their sweated
labor. The workers send a committee of protest to the management. The committee
is fired on the spot for daring to protest. Then, in desperation, the employees
strike. The strike is peaceful and orderly. The employers, however, without
provocation, get the public police to attack the strikers, wantonly clubbing
them, gassing them with tear bombs, riding them down in the streets, and
drenching them with plug streams of water in cold weather.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The employees will persist in their
strike for a living wage. Then the employers take &#8220;law and order&#8221; into
their own hands. They get thugs, armed with sawed-off shotguns employed
as deputy sheriffs. Their police suppress all meetings of the strikers,
even though held in private halls or on private grounds. They brutally
club strikers attempting peacefully to picket their plants in accordance
with law. They beat up newspaper reporters seeking the facts, smash their
cameras, and order them out of town. They then arrest the leaders of the
strike without warrant, hold them incommunicado, fix their bail from $10,000
to $50,000 each, and even refuse to make known the charges against them
until they are arraigned before a &#8220;mill&#8221; magistrate. When eminent publicists
and even clergymen come to protest against such outrages, they, too, are
clubbed, arrested, ordered out of town. When 15,000 of the strikers children
parade the streets beseeching justice for their parents they are attacked
by the police, their leaders arrested and thrown in jail.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The forgoing facts do not describe
condition in Czarist Russia, enslaved Italy, the Congo, or even in Belgium
under the German invasion. They are occurring now in state of New Jersey,
presumably a part of the United States, and are all attested by the conservative
New York Times. The strikers and their children appealed to President Coolidge
to protect their constitutional rights, but were refused an audience. They
then appealed to the Senate, and Senator La Follette immediately introduced
a resolution for a full federal investigation, which has been temporarily
blocked by Senators Edge and Edwards&#8212;the latter posing as a &#8220;friend
of labor&#8221; around election time.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The textile barons of New Jersey
refuse to meet their employee&#8217;s representatives because they are &#8220;communistic.&#8221; Stale stuff. But the evidence is complete that the big mill owners are
guilty of criminal anarchy. They have arrogantly trampled on democracy,
violated the constitutional rights of their &#8220;subjects,&#8221; and destroyed the
last vestige of impartial justice. The <em>Editor andPublisher</em>,
organ of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, after recounting
the vicious assaults of the Passaic police on newspaper men and women,
rightly concludes</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The social and economic situation
in those mills must be rotten to the core. They cannot bear the light on
a reporters camera plate. The protected industry that gets into this kind
of a war must be pretty desperate. The business calls for an investigation
by the federal authorities to its depth. The day has not yet come, under
the Stars and Stripes, when the club and the knout substitute for constitutional
guarantees.&#8221;</font>

<p><b><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The Women Textile
Strikers</font></font></em></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The strike has brought a new life
to Passaic. The union has brought new hope and a mighty promise for the
future. The women as well as the men are fired with this new hope and are
throwing themselves into the work of building the future.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The old life which the bosses forced
upon the workers bore most heavily upon the women. They too had to work
in the mills. Even the combined earnings of the husband and wife were not
enough to bring up the children. Life was a constant battle simply to keep
alive. The women spent the energy of giants in this task of keeping a home
together. They wasted all their good sharp wits in scheming how to keep
the family alive on the poor wages the boss doled out. This is not a fit
use for the great courage and strength of the working class women. It is
like throwing oneself continuously against a wall which does not yield.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But now that there is a union in
Passaic, women and men are turning all their powers together to break down
that wall. Women as well as men have come out of the old, dark narrow life.
They are no longer struggling alone, struggling merely to keep alive. They
are fighting now hand in hand with other workers. They have joined the
greatest struggle the world has, the struggle [of the] workers against
the bosses.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nobody has been more valiant and
steady on the picket line than the girls and women. Their ringing voices
have heartened many a picket line. They are working tirelessly on relief
work. They are feeding the children in the kitchen. They are working on
committees. When the strike is won, the union will turn its strength to
really constructive work. Then the women, the mill workers and the housewives
will show what the mighty heart and the tireless courage of the working
class women can do.</font>

on the picket lines and fight, for there have been worse struggles than
ours in other strikes. I remember at the coal mines when the miners were
getting started to organize years ago, the companies got the deputies out
and the deputies sure were rough. The companies had lots of ground and
the strikers had to live a long distance from the mines. They used to go
there to picket the same as we do, and the deputies would come after them
with clubs and stone them. There was no such relief then as we have now
and we had nothing to eat. The miners finally got their union and what
a help the union is! So that is what we workers want here, a union. A BIG
TEXTILE UNION!</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A prominent clergyman once gave the
following statement as his vision of scabs or strikebreakers after having
been compelled to associate with them for a short time:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"After God had finished the rattlesnake,
the toad, the vampire, he had some awful substance left, with which he
made a scab. A scab is a two-legged animal with a cork-screw soul, a water-sogged
brain, and a combination backbone made of jelly and glue. Where other folks
have their hearts he carries a tumor of rotten principles. When the scab
comes down the street, men turn their backs, angels weep tears in heaven,
and the devil shuts the gates of hell to keep them out. Judas Iscariot
was a gentleman compared with the scab, for after betraying his master
he had the decency to hang himself&#8212;and a scab has not. Esau sold his
birthright for a mess of potage. Judas Iscariot sold his savior for thirty
pieces of silver. Benedict Arnold sold his country for a promise of a commission
in the English army. The modern strikebreaker sells his birthright, his
country, his wife, his children and his fellow workers for a promise from
a boss. Esau was a traitor to his God. Benedict Arnold was a traitor to
his country. A strikebreaker is a traitor to his family, his country, himself
and to HIS CLASS. A real man is never a strikebreaker.&#8221;</font>

<p><b><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Philadelphia
Cops are Also Touchy</font></font></em></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The cops in Philadelphia have thin
skins. They have also a very tender feeling for their brother cops in Passaic.
If you want to verify this assertion go to the little town beyond Trenton
and see for yourself.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The occasion was a meeting of the
textile workers in Philadelphia held last Tuesday for the purpose of raising
funds to help the Passaic strikers. The speakers were J. O. Bentall and
N. H. Tallentire, and it was Tallentire who drew the ire of the bluecoats.
He told about the brutality of the Passaic police, when&#8212;thump, thump,
thump, came three fat cops and a very plain clothes man. There were flashes
in their eyes and sticks in their hands.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Stop that you --------&#8221; demanded
the four of them all in chorus. &#8220;Youse cannot talk that way about any police
in this country,&#8221; they roared.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was a fine demonstration of the
solidarity of the bosses and their cops, and the workers saw the point
when Bentall showed them that the workers of Passaic have already learned
that since the bosses are so well organized, it is only to be expected
that the workers will follow their good example and organize for themselves.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And then the Philadelphia workers
shoved their hands clear to the bottom of their pockets and pulled out
all the money they had to back their brothers in the big fight in the foreign
country which they call Passaic.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the two meetings that were held
there that evening they gathered nearly $300 to be shipped to the foreign
country of Passaic.</font>

general strike, the premier and the king and the press begin to brag that
the government broke the strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It did no such thing.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It simply lied.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The British miners went out when
their wages were to be cut. The general strike was called to protest against
the wage cut of the miners. When the miners were given their demands ---
or promised that the government would give them their former wages they
took the government&#8217;s word for it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now the bosses come along and fire
all the intelligent strikers and refuse them their old jobs. The bosses
in the other industries are doing the same. They think they can get by
with that, but the British workers are showing them different.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Half a million of the railway workers
have refused to go back because the bosses have &#8220;punished&#8221; some of the
members of the union by refusing to take them back. If the bosses have
no better sense than to insult the workers that way, old England the two
weeks of general strike just closed were two weeks of a beautiful picnic
compared to the pretty little fight that the bosses will have on their
hands if they begin to monkey with the union buzz saw.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The bosses are bitter when they find
the workers strong and not to be driven like cattle. If the bosses in Passaic
could drive the workers back without a union, life would not be worth living

Weisbord, and that ought to make us stick to him more than ever. He is
with the working class against the bosses. The bosses are trying to do
everything they can to get Weisbord out of Passaic but we should stick
to him to the end as he is with us fighting for us. We must not listen
to Bryan as he is against our United Front Committee, &#8220;Why did he change
so suddenly?&#8221; I guess he is getting paid by the bosses to hold meetings
and talk about our leader Weisbord. He is nothing but a strike-breaker.
The Mayor and the rest of them ought to be glad we have Weisbord as he
is the one who is keeping the strikers orderly. If we do not have him,
there would not be any scabs left, as we would show these bosses how to
treat the scabs. But we want a union and will do everything the union says.</font>

and all stick to Weisbord we will have better wages and conditions. We
are fighting for our rights and must win our demands. We worked long enough
for $14.65 a week. What can you do with $14.65 for 48 hours work when rent
is $35 and $40 a month. I would like to those bosses support a family of
six or seven children with that pay.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I am a citizen and voted for the
Mayor, but the next time I wish I had a hundred votes to keep him out of
office. Is he with the people as he said he was? No, he is with the bosses
and orders the police to club us for peacefully walking the streets.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We must all stick together and to
Weisbord, and then we are sure to win as we are in the right.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thirty thousand citizens of Passaic
and its vicinity placed themselves officially on record as supporting the
striking textile workers to the limit on Sunday at a huge mass meeting
in Belmont Park Hall.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Associated Societies and Parishes
of Passaic, Garfield and Clifton and vicinity, comprising more than forty
societies benevolent, social, religious, political, and churches, met to
endorse the strike, and to pass resolutions urging the Senate investigation
of the strike now pending.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A real citizens meeting, called by
the Association itself, it represented the actual feeling of the mass of
the people in the strike area, as to the justice of the strike. This great
body, with ramifications extending throughout the entire nation, created
the Citizens Conciliation committee which worked for more than a month
to bring the mills and the strikers together, and finally encountered the
iron refusal of the mill owners to meet the union for settlement of the
strike. The Association then declared that it must abandon its position
of neutrality and support the strikers with its full strength.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first move of the Association
was to send a committee of thirty citizens, to Washington to demand senatorial
investigation, it was announced at the meeting. The committee left on Monday
night. Plans also include the collection of relief funds for the strike
relief organization.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Association is making plans for
a huge parade in Passaic on next Sunday as a part of the campaign for additional
Passaic support. All the societies of the Association will be represented
and strikers will march in the parade.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The resolutions adopted by the meeting,
and signed by representatives of the members …….. are as follows:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Be it resolved by the undersigned
members of the Associated Societies and Parishes of Passaic, Garfield,
and Clifton and vicinity, in solemn meeting [assembled.] That</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whereas a strike of employees in
the Textile Mills situated in our Cities exists and has existed for now
a period of sixteen weeks; and</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whereas it has been charged that
the strike was instigated and is being supported by Communists; and</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whereas it has been charged that
the mill owners have lobbied for a high tariff under the plea that the
high tariff was necessary to enable their workers to have a decent American
standard of living; and</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whereas it has been charged that
these German-owned mills have not paid anywhere near the wages necessary
to live decently; and</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whereas the brutal atrocities committed
in this city, from which the strikers have been absolved by the Court of
Chancery, leads to charges that these alien-owned mills are retaliating
by these brutal measures in punishing American patriots, former employees
of these mills, for the part they took in suppression of Kaiserism in the
late World War; and</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whereas a resolution has been introduced
in the Senate of the United States of America, providing for an investigation
of the strike, its cause and duration has been referred to Committee and
no action tending to adoption of said resolution has been taken for a long
time; and</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whereas we feel that an investigation
of the situation in the local textile industries would disclose irregularities,
oppression and conditions which cannot be tolerated in any civilized community,
much less so in any portion of our United States;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therefore, Be it Resolved, that we
earnestly call to the attention of the Senate of the United States, the
conditions above enumerated, and do humbly and firmly and sincerely urge
the adoption of the pending resolution in the Senate of the United States,
providing for the investigation with all due dispatch of the Passaic Textile
Industries and of the strike, and such action taken as the conditions found
will necessitate to bring about justice to those affected and prevent the
spread of the doctrines of Communism.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The Children&#8217;s Mass
Meeting</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On sunny Saturday morning under the
big poplars in Belmont Park, a sea of little faces [surrounded] the platform.
Thousands of little arms raised waving to the man grinding the movie camera.
Thousands of little voices chanting One-Two-Three-Four&#8212;who are we for?
Union! Five-Six-Seven-Eight&#8212;whom do we appreciate? WEISBORD, Gurley
Flynn, Wagonknecht, &#8220;Professor&#8221; Lewis&#8212;and all the others who had come
to speak to them…… This was the first great mass meeting for strikers children.
Some called them children, some called them kids. Others called them young
strikers or young pickets. Young comrades and young fellow-workers. They
had come to hear about the plans for children&#8217;s camps, children&#8217;s milk,
vacations in the homes of friendly labor union people in other towns and
other measures to be taken to care for the young folks while the fight-to-the-finish
is carried on.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Alfred Wagenknecht explained it all
--- how the children of the poorer workers would be taken first to the
half dozen camps already prepared for the summer, how more camps would
be found, how hundreds of children who had never been away from their crowded
homes in summer would this year be taken on a vacation at the expense of
the Strikers&#8217; Relief Committee&#8212;how they would eat good nourishing food,
many of them for the first time in their lives, how they would sleep in
the open air and grow strong in the woods while their relieved mothers
would be able to stay at home and, with less care and worry, carry on the
fight for the union and for the victory that is coming.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The children listened and were wild
with joy. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to camp.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m going to live at Miss Flynn&#8217;s house,&#8221; cried some of the little ones sitting on the edge of the platform. &#8220;My
mother said I could go.&#8221; &#8220;So did mine.&#8221; The atmosphere was electric with
warm anticipation.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">C. J. Hendley of the Teachers union
of New York City, who teaches school and prepares correspondence lessons
for the Workers&#8217; Education Bureau of the A. F. of L., and Alfred Baker
Lewis, also a teacher and writer, told the children that the New York folks
would gladly welcome them to their homes and help them in their struggles
of their parents to gain a decent livelihood and a union. They told them
to remember the historic example of George Washington at Valley Forge and
the others who fought for &#8220;representation&#8221; 150 years ago&#8212;how though
hungry and starving and weak and weary the men who worked for independence
in those days had won their goal. The little pickets applauded these history
lessons.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then the wife of Rabbi Stephen S.
Wise of New York, who has been raising money for the children&#8217;s milk fund
told them how wonderful was the stand of their parents and what it would
mean to them all to enjoy, in the future, the benefits of the union conditions
the older folks would win out of this strike. Mrs. Andrews of the Fellowship
of Reconciliation told of the way the children of the rich enjoy their
summers and the wealth that is showered upon them to give them health and
strength. &#8220;The poor children are just as fine and just as brave and beautiful
as the children of the rich. You should have equal advantages and you WILL
have if this union can be established to gain the better things of life
for your fathers and mothers and yourselves.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then came Albert Weisbord for whom
the children had been crying all morning. What gay and happy shouts went
up as he picked his way carefully through the crowd to the platform. Yet
before he could begin speaking, the police, evidently with a deliberate
desire to disturb the happy and peaceful meeting and throw fear into the
hearts of the children, came over and arrested Jack Rubenstein, picket
captain, who was standing, watching the demonstration for Weisbord.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was just the moment when the bulls
thought they could cause the most commotion. But the children were not
excited. Albert Weisbord explained the frame-up of their friend Jack Rubenstein,
who had beet led away to the patrol wagon. The children, used to arrests
and the tyranny of the Cossacks, seemed to realize it was just a continuation
of the previous day&#8217;s terrorism when many of their mothers and friends
had been beaten up standing in front of their own houses.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then Robert Dunn of the American
Civil Liberties Union told the police in front of the children, that the
minuet interference&#8217;s with free speech, assembly, the right to walk on
the public sidewalks, and the right to picket peacefully in all the strike
towns, were discontinued, his organization would withdraw from the scene!
But that he doubted if the mill-controlled mayors and magistrates and deputies
would relieve him of the duty of coming to Passaic and Garfield pretty
regularly until the strike was won.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Elizabeth Gurly Flynn pointed put
the hypocrisies of the big absentee German mill owners with their castles
in Germany and their summer homes in America, and contrasted the condition
of their homes and their children with</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">the pale faces of the strikers children,
while Albert Weisbord showed the children how much they DIDN&#8217;T learn from
their school teachers about the realities of life&#8212;the profits of the
mills and the blacklist and spy systems of the Wool Council. But the children
are getting their lessons in Americanism, not from the tracts of the National
Security League but from witnessing the clubbings of the police and the
ruthless and illegal actions of the local justices, and petty law officers.
From such scenes as those of the previous day on Dayton Ave. they would
learn more about Americanism than in their whole life at school.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To All Labor Unions, Workers Fraternal
Organizations, Textile Strikers Relief Conferences, Other Sympathetic Associations:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Greetings to all our Friends.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shall the textile workers have the
right to organize?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shall the right to bargain collectively,
a right established and accepted everywhere, be abrogated by the textile
mill owners? Shall the right to picket, legal under the laws of New Jersey,
be violated by the textile barons? Shall the right to speak and hold meetings
be abolished? Is New Jersey in the United States?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We, the Textile Strikers, want to
confer with you about these matters. We want to confer with you also regarding
the support&#8212;now necessary&#8212;now that the mill owners have closed
the doors to negotiations for a strike settlement. It is intention of the
mill owners TO WIPE US OUT, to kill our attempt to organize.&#8212;Now we
need your support&#8212;your [advice] more than ever.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You surely want us to win! And permit
us to tell you that the bitter fight being made is a fight against all
of labor, against us by the textile barons, against labor unionism. If
we can organize the textile workers in Passaic and vicinity, then the textile
workers in other textile centers will be encouraged to organize. Then the
steel workers, the rubber workers, the oil workers&#8212;millions of unorganized
workers will be encouraged to organize. The textile barons know of this
as do their colleagues, the steel, oil, rubber barons. So this fight is
your fight. If we win, you win. If we win, organized labor wins.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are calling the conference to
take place in Passaic N. J., Saturday, May 29<sup>th</sup> at 10 A. M.
The 10,000 Textile Strikers ask your organization to elect a delegate to
this conference. Besides the questions touched upon in the first paragraph,
the BIG QUESTION of aiding the strikers children will be placed upon the
agenda.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">COME TO THE &#8220;SUPPORT THE PASSAIC

United Front Committee For Better Fight</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Eager to follow the example of Passaic,
the United Front Committee of Lawrence has reorganized itself at its last
meeting with a view of carrying on a real and earnest campaign of propaganda
and organization among the Lawrence Textile Workers. The best working class
elements representing the militant workers who have, fought in the front
line of all the workers struggles in Lawrence, are again throwing themselves
into the work of organizing the unorganized textile workers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Among the organizations affiliated
with the Lawrence United Front Committee are the Fronco-Belgians, the Italian
workers club of Lawrence, the Russian club, the Armenian workers club,
the Lithuanian workers, the Arlington Mill Unit, the Pacific mill workers
unit, the loom fixers union A. F. T. O. and many individuals identified
with the Lawrence Labor movement, and Passaic workers who are members at
large. The reorganization plan consists of the following 13 points:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1. Any organization of Textile Workers,
such as: local unions, mill units, language groups and any working class
organizations, social, fraternal and economic are eligible to affiliate

of Textile Workers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3. No officer of or anyone having
official connection with a company union can be a member of, or a delegate
to the United Front Committee of Textile Workers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4. Members of the United Front Committee
who are at present connected with or are officials of a company union must
publicly resign from such company union and from any official position
in same.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">5. The United Front Committee is

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">6. Representation shall be three
delegates from organizations up to 50 members and five delegates from organizations

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Lawrence United
Front Committee Fights Company Union In Pacific Mill</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Lawrence United Front Committee
of Textile Workers has declared war against the company union in the Pacific
mill. The United Front Committee and all Lawrence workers recognize the
Pacific shop council or Company Union as a tool of the mill owners used
to offset Unionism and to the workers from organizing. The company union
is operated, owned and controlled by the bosses and is always used to O.K.
wage cuts, speed-up systems and the fleecing of the workers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The United Front Committee declared
in [unmistakable] terms that it will fight to the bitter end against this
menace, and that it will not tolerate any individuals who have any connections
with the Shop Council or the bosses Company union. Accordingly by a large
and decisive majority vote at its meeting of May 8<sup>th</sup>, the United
Front Committee decided to purge its ranks of all elements who are close
to the boss, and voted that the Chairman of the United Front Committee,
who is a member of the Plant Committee representing the Lower Pacific,
shall resign from the company union.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The representative of the Dyers department
on the shop council and the member of the Plant Committee defended the
Shop Council, and the Pacific company union, and attempted to break up
the meeting of the United Front Committee. They proved themselves to be
enemies of the Lawrence Textile workers by defending the Bosses, and attacking
the Passaic strikers who are in Lawrence working for the relief. The overwhelming
majority of the United Front Committee however, refused to be terrorized
and forced them to choose between the Bosses shop council and the United
Front Committee. A small group then withdrew from the meeting and declared
themselves outside of the United Front Committee.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Lawrence Textile workers will
only gain strength by the elimination of the company union from the United
Front Committee. The workers of the Pacific mill have already repudiated
the bosses shop council and will have nothing to do with it. The best elements
of the Lawrence workers are rallying to the United Front Committee. The
struggle against the company union is a signal to the militant elements
who have fought best for better conditions for the Lawrence workers, to
put their shoulder to the wheel.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A United Front of the workers against
the united front of the bosses.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Forward to the organization of the
Lawrence Textile Workers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Forward to higher wages and better
conditions.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Pacific Mill owners are not satisfied
with the large profits which they have made in the last few years. They
have a planning board made up of efficiency men who watch the workers time
and measure their [moves]. They are forever adding speed-up systems which
throw out men from work and reduce the pay envelopes of those who remain
at work. Of course every speed-up system added means not only smaller wages
but also harder work. The efficiency men look upon the workers not as human
beings but as tools for profits for the mill owners. The efficiency men
get from five to ten thousand dollars per year. The Pacific Mill bosses
are forever cutting the wages of the workers because they claim they do
not making enough profits. Yet we find according to their own reports that
they had twice as much wealth last year as in the year of 1919.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1919 they were worth $46,483,605.
In 1920, $48,464,322; 1921, $47,453,837; 1922, $54,623,961; 1923, $67,463,388;
1924, $80,107,225. Every year in the last four years on which the report
was made that over two millions were paid out in dividends.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After slaving many years in the A
dye house of the Arlington Mills running a kettle, a worker was fired because
he is not young anymore. His young days were swallowed up by the cloth.
His young days were coined into hundreds of dollars for the mill owners
who never see the mill. In the winter time they are at the Miami Beach
and in the summer time down in Riviera throwing away the millions which
they squeeze from the workers. In the year 1924 according to their own
report, the company earned $1,432,611. During that year many wage cuts
were handed to the workers on the claim that the company does not make
enough.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On what will he live now? On the
profits which the boss made from him? Try to get it. One more is added
to the army of unemployed who are knocking about for a chance to be employed,
for a chance to be turned into more glittering coins for the mill owners,
the parasites.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The little children of these textile
towns, the streets are swarming with them. The barren streets of Garfield,
the straggling streets of Lodi, the hot, crowded streets of the East Side,
all are swarming with the little children of the textile strikers. They
are not healthy, strong children. They are not rosy-cheeked, fat and strong
as every mother would like to see her child. They are growing up sick,
these children of the textile workers. The children of the Slavs, with
their big brown eyes and golden hair, the children of the Germans, blue-eyed
and yellow-haired, the dark-eyed and black-haired children of the Italians
and the Hungarians. ……. and all alike these children have pale, thin little
faces. There are dark rings around their eyes such as should never be seen
in a child&#8217;s face. They are listless and tired, as though they were old
already in their childhood. Their little bodies are thin and without energy.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mothers of Passaic and other textile
towns, you know why your children are growing up sick instead of strong
and well. You know too, why so many of your babies cannot even grow up
at all, but fall victim to some sickness when they are still very little
children. You know why 50 percent more children die here than in other
towns of New Jersey. Behind your pale little children you see the crimes
of the bosses who are draining your children&#8217;s life just as surely as though
they came into your home and strangled them. With their low wages and wage-cuts,
they will not allow you to buy enough food to make your children healthy.
They have starved your children.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You yourself still have a strong
body. You come from the old country. There you were poor, yes, but you
still had good air to breathe and worked out of doors and had food to eat.
Here, in this textile hell-hole in America, you live in three little crowded
rooms. You live on bread and black coffee. You cannot afford milk, butter,
the things that are good and make people strong. You cannot feed your children.
How can your children meet life when they grow up with their weak and sickly
bodies? The bosses are preparing a hell for your children worse than the
hell you yourself are living in.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mothers, the union is fighting for
life for your children, while the bosses would bring them death. This strike
is a fight for living conditions so that children can grow up strong, rosy
and happy. The mothers of the strike will never give up the fight for their
children. Every mother of these towns who is a textile worker belongs in
the union.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is no force in nature stronger
than a woman fighting for her child. Mothers of the textile towns, look
into the faces of your children, sickly as they are and pale, and swear
that you will never give up the fight until we have won the union which
alone can make your children strong and well.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The eight picketers and the Sergeant
of Police met each other in front of the Forstmann-Huffmann mills. It was
Friday afternoon. Friday, terror had broken loose again. The streets were
full of people talking about arrests, talking about the picket lines that
had been broken up, people clubbed. Some said the police had entered a
house and dragged people out. Others had seen a women roughly handled.
There was the feel of violence in the air. The terror of a month ago seemed
about to break loose again and all the strikers felt it. Jack Rubenstein
had been arrested again.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Through the swarming streets flew
the rumors of fresh police violence. Quiet people walking along had been
met by police and told them they could not pass through Clifton. No wonder
the people from everywhere are standing in knots on the sidewalk that all
the side streets were filled and that every window was as full of people
as though it was a box at the theater. A funny sight. The houses with their
windows bobbing with heads. People waiting for something to happen.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The restraining injunction which
made it a crime for any member of the United Front to speak to anyone from
the Forstmann-Huffmann mills, had been modified. Eight pickets were to
be allowed. In spite of the new injunction allowing picketing, the pickets
had been chased away by police.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The afternoon of Friday was the test.
Friends from New York had come out to see whether or not the police were
still there to prevent picketing. Mr. Josephs, the lawyer of the Civil
Liberties, was with them. The Sergeant, met the picketers gruffly with:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"You can walk as far as the telegraph
pole, see, and back as far as the gate,&#8212;&#8217;At oughta be enough for you.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There followed a long wrangle between
Mr. Josephs and the Sergeant. The pickets waited. The people on the streets
moved restlessly. Cops on motorcycles swooped up and down. To one side
stood Mr. Rheinholt of the Forstmann-Huffmann mills, watching the proceedings.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Well,&#8221; added the sergeant threateningly,
"you heard what I told you, your pickets do like I said, or you get 16
weeks.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The brief line of pickets began their
march up and down in front of the mills. A roar of applause went up from
the sidewalk, old women leaned out of the windows and clapped their hands.
People on the sidewalk and people in the windows for blocks cheered. The
people in the houses began singing Solidarity.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The pickets walking along so tranquilly,
meant that the injunction had been lifted. The people on the sidewalk watching
them, were almost another form of picket line.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Presently the first group of pickets
were relieved by another group of eight. These too, got their share of
applause. The crowds on the street grew a little denser. They did not block
the sidewalk but people in Garfield and Passaic are not allowed to stand
in front of their own doorstep, so it seems. Friendly people cannot watch
the picket line without the police wanting to do something about it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Break &#8216;em up, break &#8216;em up,&#8221; the
Sergeant hollered. And the motorcycle cop rode swiftly along the sidewalk,
warning people into their houses, making them go into stores.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Go on in, go on in, get off the
street,&#8221; the motorcycle cop warns an old woman.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Now, I can&#8217;t stay on the street
any more, now I got to go in the house when the cops tell me,&#8221; she grumbles.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A cop on a motorcycle is worse than
a mounted policeman. Presently the people were out of the house again.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Break &#8216;em up, break &#8216;em up,&#8221; calls
the Sergeant and again the motorcycle cop rides arrogantly on the sidewalk
and grumbling, protesting. The people go into the houses and not only the
strikers, but the store keepers and other working people living around
there are driven in. Were they disorderly? Of course not. They were standing
around like they would do on a Sunday, watching like they might have watched
anything interesting that passed the house. Why did they have to go in?
They were driven off the streets because they were watching picketers.
Meantime, the picket line moves up and down, sturdily, and the people watch
from the windows and doorways.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Strikers Statement
to the Public</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For many years we were dumb. We were
oppressed by a system of terrorism and espionage unequalled in this country.
We were cursed with low wages and inhuman, unsanitary working conditions.
We had to work long hours. Our women folk were forced into the mills to
work all night. We were so tired we could have no home life, no time for
children, no time to develop ourselves as men and women should. If many
of us remained illiterate, if our homes were broken up, if many of our
children filled an early grave, it was because the mill owners, having
us absolutely in their power, willed it to be so.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But we are determined with all the
strength that is in us, that this shall be so no longer. The ten per cent
wage cut that the mill owners forced upon us, awakened us to our peril
and called every man and woman of us into the fight to defend our homes
and our lives. If we have to starve to death, we shall not starve slaving
inside the mills, but rather we shall [die] struggling for life and liberty.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In this fight we find it necessary
to organize ourselves into our own union, into the United Front Committee
of Textile Workers of Passaic and vicinity. Without such a union we are
helpless, with no safety, with no security, with no chance to work out
a destiny of our own.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We understand full well what the
fight for a union means. Our fight for the right of collective bargaining
is a fight to check the irresponsible power of the bosses. It is a fight
to defend our best people who would be outlawed and blacklisted. It is
a fight to hold whatever we may win in this struggle. We are determined
to win in Passaic now that right of collective bargaining which has been
won long ago by most of the workers in this country.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There never can be peace in the industries
in Passaic until the workers here, as they have elsewhere, become a part
of the organized labor movement.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We must have a union, we will have
a union.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">THE UNITED FRONT COMMITTEE OF TEXTILE
WORKERS OF PASSAIC AND VICINITY.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">**********************************************</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Save the Children!</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Are they the children of an American
city, these children of the textile strikers of Passaic and vicinity, or
are they the specters of some famine haunted country we have read about
far away? Their pale, pinched little faces are like those pictures we used
to see of the children dying of hunger in Germany, in China, in Armenia.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But walk about the streets of these
towns. Workers of America, see the children swarming on every hand. See
them at the meeting halls, listening to the speakers, with eager eyes shining
intently in white, peaked faces. See them at the children&#8217;s kitchens, see
them smile as they crowd in and sit down wonderingly before a bowl of good
soup and a cup of milk and go out happily clutching an apple. See them
as we see them here, and you will know their reality. Thousands of little
children of strikers would meet you on every hand. In their faces&#8212;not
children&#8217;s faces most of them, but worn, old looking faces of people burdened
by life&#8212;you will find a strange look of questioning. They are questioning
you, Workers of America. All these thousands of children are asking you:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"What is to become of us? How do
you think we are to grow up? Our fathers work days, our mothers work nights.
But together they cannot make enough to feed us. We live in flats of three
little crowded rooms. We live in darkness and dirt. We never see our parents.
Look at us, our bodies are thin and underdeveloped, so that we look three
or four years younger than we are. We have no strength to grow up. Workers
of America, who is to take care of us? Our parents are fighting for us
with all their strength. They are fighting a terrible enemy, the textile
bosses. Do the bosses care whether we live or die? They make profits on
our lives; they do not care. Workers of America, we want to grow up strong
so that we too can take our place in the ranks of the workers and fight
for freedom. We want to survive ---it is you who must help us!&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The children are asking for a milk
fund for the babies and the little children under seven. Think of it, babies
of the textile strikers are brought up on black coffee and bread. The wage
cut took their milk away. Thousands of dollars for milk for the thousands
of little children under seven! More money for the kitchens that are feeding
the children of all ages. Thousands of dollars for meals for thousands
of children!</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then, we have a plan for something
that will make the children open their eyes and smile with such happiness
as they never knew before. We want to send away the children of the Passaic
strikers for summer vacation. Think of it! To go to the country! To leave
the hideous, hot little den that is called home; to go where there is swell
air and plenty of food and care and rest. For the children of Passaic,
that is a dream of Paradise. For their parents it means new strength to
fight on, without the worry of hungry children to drive them back to work.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Workers of America, we depend upon
you to realize these dreams. We must raise money so that no child will
be hungry, so that no baby will be without milk. We must have help in finding
summer camps and money to send</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">our children to them. You have stood
by us like soldiers fighting the same battle. We know the workers are with
us.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Send us your dollars now so that
we may save our children for the fights of the future. Save our children
so that we can win our strike.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Funds for the children should be
sent to the General Relief Committee of Textile Strikers, 743 Main Avenue.
Passaic, Secretary, Gustav Deak.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Will &#8220;Employ Only
a Few&#8221;</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Yes, now they come with another new
one that is as old as the hills.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The bosses declare to the public
that when the mills resume operation they can take back only a few.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therefore they do not want to deal
with those whom they cannot take back.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therefore they will not talk the
matter over with the union.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Supreme logic!</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But suppose the union tells you that
you have to take them all back. Suppose the union calls for such distribution
of work and such hours that all may be employed. Then what will you do?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That is what the union is for. The
union is for the purpose of taking care of the workers and see to it that
the bosses may not throw out the best and most intelligent of them and
drag the rest down into slavery again.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is unthinkable that the bosses
should have such hard hearts that they would not take back all the workers
after they have been weeping so many round tears over the great loss to
the workers during this strike. How could they be so cruel or thoughtless?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The idleness of the workers during
the strike has been called a horrible calamity. Will not the idleness of
the workers whom the boss cannot take back be a horrible calamity also?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The bosses never knew they talked
so much foolishness till the workers began to show them. But now we are
in shape to tell them that they cannot pull any more wool over our eyes.
We want them to economize and use the wool for cloth instead.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the bosses cannot employ the workers
after the strike is won by us, why worry about the strike? Why issue those
long lamentations about the bad condition in the textile industry and why
bewail the predicament of the workers who are on strike?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is no worse for a worker to be
idle while on strike than to be idle after the boss has fired him, is it?
While he is on strike there is relief and support for his family. When
he is fired or laid off, who supports him then? Does the boss give him
bread? Does the boss give him milk for his babies?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What is eating the boss is not the
hardship of the workers but the slimness of his own profits. The boss can
weep his cellar full of salt tears over the workers but we cannot get excited
about it. We will not limp around with a broken heart if the boss drowns
in his flood of tears shed over the poor workers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What we are after now is the recognition
of the union, and the bosses might as well get that straight, first as
last. If only ten go back they will go back as a union. If ten thousand
go back they will go back as a union. If all go back they will go back
as a union.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The union will see to it that when
the workers return to the mills they will work under decent conditions,
and not under the tyranny of the unscrupulous bosses.</font>
<center>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">********************************************</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>The Right to Work</font></font></b></center></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now aren&#8217;t the bosses wonderful.
They say that every one who wants to shall have a chance to work and the
"right to work.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then in the same breath they say
that they can employ only a very few when the strike is ended. What about
the other workers? Will not they have a &#8220;right to work?&#8221; Will not the pretty
mayor of Garfield and his judge please tell the public that &#8220;workers who
want to work shall have a right to work?&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let those supreme hypocrites come
along and show us that they mean what they say. If they are worth the salt
that might keep them from smelling like a rotting carcass they will come
forth and tell the bosses to take back all the workers and give every one
"the right to work.&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What these white sepulchers mean
is that the scabs shall have the right to scab and help break the strike
if possible. Neither the bosses nor the mayors nor the judges give a hang
for the &#8220;right to work&#8221; when the bosses throw the workers out on the street
after they have used them enough.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What are you going to do with the
workers who may not be employed after the strike is over? Are you going
to see to it that they shall &#8220;have the right to work?&#8221;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We might inform you that every time
you blabber about protecting the &#8220;workers who want to work&#8221; the strikers
laugh at you and call you hypocrites. The idiocy of the masters and their
lackeys has become the laughing stock of the workers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Try something else and give us a
change, please. You are getting tiresome.</font>
