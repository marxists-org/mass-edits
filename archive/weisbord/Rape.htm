<p><b><font size=+2>A Woman Writes of Rape</font></b>
<p>Book Review by Vera Buch Weisbord
<br />(From the magazine &#8220;La Parola del Popolo")</center></p>

<p><font size=+1>"Against Our Will&#8212;Men, Women and Rape&#8221;, by Susan Brownmiller:
Simon &amp; Schuster, New York, 1975.</font>
<p>AT LAST in this massive scholarly work the outcry of the victims finds
utterance. The facts on rape are assembled from early tribal times, through
the ancient societies of the Middle East, later English society, American
Indian customs and those of slavery in the USA, the wars of modern times:
World Wars I &amp; II, Bangladesh and Vietnam, riots, pogroms and revolutions
as well as what is happening in contemporary America. It is not possible
to give more than a brief summary of the data (the source notes fill 38
pages).
<p>Brownmiller dwells on the physiological aspects of rape as a violent
penetration of the sexual parts of a woman against her will and with no
possibility of retaliation in kind from her. She stresses the dire effects
on the victim: not merely the physical trauma but the shock and fear, often
leaving the woman a nervous wreck. She brings out the humiliating treatment
accorded rape victims in police stations and even in hospitals, the impossibility
of obtaining a fair trial under present circumstances. Women have to live
all their lives in fear of rape.
<p>In primitive societies mass rape was common; later women became &#8220;man&#8217;s
first piece of real property,&#8221; page 17 (*) their offspring also the property
of the father. An &#8220;historical landmark&#8221; to this author was the holding
of one woman permanently by one man not merely for her domestic labor but
for the exclusive use of her body as well. Rape of virgins later (in ancient
Hebrew society) became a crime when fathers found themselves with damaged
property (ravished daughters) difficult to sell or dispose of.
<p>Rape of black women by their masters under slavery in the USA is dealt
with in full. &#8220;Forced sexual exploitation of the black woman under slavery
was not offhand experience. Total control over her reproductive system
meant a steady supply of slave babies, and slave children, when they reached
the age of six or eight, were put to work,&#8221; pages 153-4.
<p>Mass rapes as well as innumerable single rapes were always an accompaniment
of wars both ancient and modern, and of this the book gives ample documentation.
Rape in war is seen as a price paid by the women of the invaded, conquered
country as well as an humiliation of the male population&#8230;.. &#8220;Rape by
a conqueror is compelling evidence of the conqueror&#8217;s status of male impotence,&#8221; page 38.
<p>Brownmiller exposes the fallacy of the old myth, whether in war or in
peace, of rape being a necessary and excusable outlet for the male need
to ejaculate. She shows how in Vietnam in spite of the existence of massage
parlors,&#8221; &#8220;hootchmaids,&#8221; and military brothels for the sexual relief of
the soldiers, rapes single and especially gang raps by soldiers on Vietnamese
women were common. When the victim did not die from repeated brutal assaults,
the soldiers summarily murdered her to remove the evidence of their crime.
<p>For the study of rape in contemporary America, the author bases herself
on the Uniform Crime Reports of the FBI, police department records, several
specific studies by sociologists in a number of cities, as well as a great
many books of a more general nature. A typical portrait of a rapist results:
"From the no-nonsense reports of the FBI statistics and some intensive
sociological studies &#8230; the typical American rapist is no weirdo phycho-schizophrenic
beset by timidity, sexual deprivation and a domineering wife or mother.&#8221; &#8230; A typical rapist &#8220;is an aggressive, hostile youth who chooses to
do violence to women,&#8221; page 176. Brownmiller stresses also the economic
background: rape, like all crimes of violence, is more prevalent in the
lower economic levels of society.
<p>That rapists are chiefly black, a common belief, is refuted. &#8220;The crimes
of blacks are disproportionate to their population ratio in the census
figures, but not in their economic position,&#8221; page 181. The FBI reports
of 1975 find 47 per cent of rapists black and 51 per cent white, page 176.
In all studies rapists are predominantly young, in the 16-24 age group.
The belief that black men assaulting white women is the most common form
of rape appears to be unfounded. Black on blacks is most common. As for
rape convictions, there is ample evidence that black men are more frequently
convicted and get heavier sentences, especially if the victim is a white
woman.
<p>Statistics prove that most rapes are not attacks of one man on one woman,
but rather are committed in pairs or groups. A Philadelphia study finds
55 per cent by gangs and 16 per cent by pairs, page 188. The true nature
of rape becomes apparent in these studies of gang rapes. Such rapes are
not spontaneous actions; they are planned. The pair or group decide to
indulge in this pastime; they select a victim, convey her to some secluded
spot and proceed to assault her. The victim is completely helpless whether
or not there is display of a weapon. Furthermore, the rapists are not satisfied
with repeated sexual assaults; they indulge in defilement of the victim&#8217;s
body: urinating and ejaculating over her, burning her with cigarettes,
stuffing foreign objects into her vagina, etc. (Such defilement&#8217;s occurred
in the Vietnam gang rapes also.) Such actions reveal the true male psychology
of rape: it is primarily an assertion of male dominance, but at the same
time an expression of contempt of women, a desire to degrade the woman
to the lowest possible level.
<p>Of single rapes, whether they occur on the street or in the bedroom,
most are accompanied by robbery. Typical is the robber breaking into the
woman&#8217;s apartment at night and &#8220;combining business with pleasure.&#8221; <p>THE sad, sordid story of male rape and prostitution, so common in all
our US penal institutions is exposed thoroughly and sympathetically. Incest
and child molestation in the home are also dealt with. Brownmiller explodes
the myth current in fiction and TV serials of the &#8220;heroic rapist&#8221; and the
"willing victim.&#8221; <p>While I appreciate the value of Brownmiller&#8217;s researches I must take
exception to some of her postulations, as for example: &#8220;Concepts of hierarchy,
slavery and private property flowed from, and could only be predicated
upon the initial subjugation of women,&#8221; pages 17-18. Too great simplification
makes this incorrect. Long before the tribal period in question, in what
is known as the matriarchate, women had a decisive voice and descent was
traced through the woman&#8217;s line. All this probably coincided with the time
when the role of the male in procreation was not yet known. Men then venerated
women for this mysterious power they alone had of producing offspring.
When the function of the semen became known there was a drastic reversal
of roles; then began phallic worship, the putting down of women and the
establishment of male dominance which has persisted until today.
<p>F. Engles (basing himself upon Morgan) says: &#8220;The downfall of maternal
law was the historic defeat of the female sex. The men seized the reins
also in the house, the women were stripped of their dignity, enslaved,
tools of men&#8217;s lust and mere machines for the generation of children,&#8221; Engels: &#8220;Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State,&#8221; page 70.
Engels also shows the transfer to monogamy which subjected one woman to
one man to have taken place gradually over a long period of time, not at
one blow.
<p>I find missing in &#8220;Against Our Will&#8221; a full account of the special exposures
of working women to rape (factory workers by foremen, secretaries forced
into unwilling relations with their bosses, women who work at night exposed
in the streets, etc. Wealthy women are surely more protected against rape.
<p>To me the gang rape may be seen in a way as something akin to going
hunting, really a survival of very old instincts. But while the stalking
and killing of big game required courage, assaulting a helpless woman is
to say the least, an act of abject cowardice. As slavery bred cruelty in
the master, so subjugation of women breeds contempt and a desire to take
it out on her. It may be added that war-making capitalist countries have
to train their future soldiers in attitudes of brutality and callousness.
<p>As a Marxist I believe it will take a revolution to eliminate rape from
society. On the other hand, since it is such a deeply-rooted thing, as
much physiological as sociological, and long predating capitalism, it will
not be overcome simply by the expropriation of the means of production
by the producers. It is really a question of creating a new, more civilized
human being. Equality of women&#8212;or of blacks, or any other oppressed
minority, will be achieved only when the class struggle comes to an end
leaving no motive of one group to suppress another. With a genuine socialist
revolution on an international scale, at last the scourge of war will be
eliminated, releasing untold energies now devoted to slaughter and destruction
to creative human purpose. Then we may hope for an end to such outrages
as rape.
