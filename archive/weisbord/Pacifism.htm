<p><font size=+2>Offshoots of Liberalism&#8212;Pacifism</font>
<br />By Albert Weisbord
<p>I</center></p>

<p>Among the interminable writings of the Liberals there has been developed
the proposition that society has evolved from militarism to industrialism.
From this thesis there flows the implication that, since the highest product
of industrialism is Liberalism, the dove of peace rests contentedly on
the Liberals shoulders. From first to last the thesis is false.
<p>Contrary to popular misconceptions, in the beginning of human society
war was generally unknown. Life was too precarious, the means of subsistence
too difficult to obtain, and the instruments at hand too puny for war possibly
to have been carried on to any considerable degree in the lowest levels
of savagery. (*1) What damage could the savage have done with his crude
paleolithic knife? What sort of mass warfare could have been carried on
with stone and club? War on a really grand scale demanded far better implements
to be devised.
<p>In the upper level of savagery, although the bow and arrow were used,
and the possibilities for war were thus increased, there was still little
incentive and profit in war. The maintenance of life was still too difficult
for tribes to devote any considerable part of their time to warfare. There
being as yet no private property, war for permanent aggrandizement was
unknown. Finally, the practice of exogamy, that is, the custom of seeking
one&#8217;s wife outside the tribe and among neighboring tribes, militated severely
against mutual tribal warfare.
<p>Among the Plains Indians in North America &#8220;It was common, in early times,
for a battle or skirmish to last all day, with great display of daring
and horsemanship, but with scarcely more killed and wounded than might
be carried from the field during a university game of football.&#8221; (*2) Warfare
was regarded as a tournament, never for territorial aggrandizement or overthrow
of a brother nation. And, says the same writer, &#8220;The slayer of a man in
battle was expected to mourn for thirty days&#8230;.&#8221; (*3)
<p>Thus we may say, &#8220;War like everything else in the universe has had a
beginning. And in searching for its origin one discovers that it is non-existent
among plants, animals and savages. It was found that the latter are, contrary
to the benighted belief of bourgeois scholarship, the most peaceful of
men.&#8221; <p>&#8220;If the savage ever fights, and he seldom does, we find him engaged
in personal combat, generally with the intention of rendering his antagonist
<em>hors du combat</em> rather than slaying him.&#8221; (*4)
<p>During the period of the lower stage of barbarism there occurs that
which to the civilized observer appears like war, namely, raids by parties
of one tribe against the others. The raid could be as an act of vengeance,
or for abduction of women, or for head or scalp hunting as a means of increasing
the raiders standing within the tribe and of carrying out religious customs.
Later these tribal raids became forays for cattle or for slaves. Arranged
spontaneously, the raids were participated in by only a few members of
the tribe, and would die down as quickly as they arose; fights once started
stopped very soon.
<p>It was only with the rise of private property and slavery that warfare
begins. But even here the armies that were gathered against each other
resembled loose hordes rather than organized bodies of men. Not until the
barbarians came in contact with civilization did they seriously begin to
organize mass formations of warriors. In the early days, instead of going
at each others throats, the armies would adopt the general procedure of
sending forth champions from each side to fight individual combats, the
whole army agreeing to abide by the results waged by their champions. Biblical
stories, Greek mythology, ancient sagas of all sorts, amply testify to
this mode of battle. The results were not very bloody.
<p>As civilization and slavery came into being so did the incentive and
means of regular war. War in the modern sense became organized with the
formation of the political State. The same forces that bring society to
differentiate itself into ruling classes and oppressed classes and thus
leading to the formation of the State, also create that military might
which can wage war professionally against other societies and States. War
and civil war have the same roots.
<p>War and politics are inseparable and von Clausewitz well says: &#8220;The
political result is the object; war is but the means to accomplish the
object. We see, therefore, that war is not merely a political act, but
also a real political instrument, a continuation of political commerce,
a carrying out of the same by other means.&#8221; (*5)
<center>
<p><b>* * * *</b></center></p>

<p>It was during the chaos of feudalism coinciding with the collapse of
the old states of antiquity founded on slavery on the one hand, and the
dissolution of the barbarian tribes on the other, that the condition of
war of all against all broke out and the hierarchy of serf society was
created. The fact, however, that society had taken to crude agriculture,
rooting each community to the soil and isolating one group from the other
often by vast stretches of wilderness, precluded mutual wars of annihilation.
The wars that took place were initiated by individual rulers and their
armed retinues rather than by a mass of serfs, who, in fact, remained essentially
untouched by the tempests breaking around them.
<p>Money and commerce, that is, the very forces which generate Liberalism,
gave warfare the impetus to attain a wholesale murderous character. The
Crusades are an example. It was the moneyed men allied with the Liberals
within the Catholic Church who initiated and pressed forward the mighty
Crusades. Involving as they did millions of people and armies of hundreds
of thousands, the Crusades meant not only a new deal for the Catholic Church
and the annihilation of a good part of the nobility, but also brought unheard
of wealth to the merchants and traders of the times. Thus, the Crusades
not only laid the basis for the power of the Catholic Church, but also
for nationalism and Absolute Monarchy.
<p>Under a monarchy, the State wars were principally dynastic conflicts
for territorial advancement. At first, the central authority was too weak
to maintain a very large standing army and met great resistance from the
upper aristocracy. &#8220;The strongest army put into the field by Francis I
would have withered away before a single division of the army of Petain
or Foch. Even in the most advanced states of the sixteenth century, the
government lived from hand to mouth, improvising armies and navies to suit
particular occasions, and driven to the most desperate expedients for finance.
To recruit, to pay, to feed a national army were feats not only beyond
the power of any government to execute, but beyond the scope of any statesman
to conceive. Charles VII of France had asked of every parish in France
that it should maintain an archer for the wars. The scheme broke down at
once. His successor, Louis XI, fell back on a force of foreign mercenaries.&#8221; (*6)
<p>At this stage, the mass of peasantry were generally untouched, but a
bitter struggle went on among the knights and nobles as feudalism disintegrated
and Absolute Monarchy rose. This struggle in some countries resulted in
a practically complete extirpation of the secondary aristocracy. After
the Wars of the Roses in England, for example, Henry VII could summon only
twenty-eight peers to his first parliament, and even Henry VIII only thirty-six.
In France the nobility was reduced to the level of courtiers and courtesans.
Feudal castles were finally blown to bits with the introduction of more
powerful means of destruction, gunpowder, muskets, and cannon. The old
feudal retainers were wiped out to the great advantage of the King.
<p>Liberalism, therefore, made its bow into the world coincident with the
increasingly destructive character of warfare. How difficult it is for
Liberalism to identify itself with Pacifism can be seen from the most cursory
examination of political history. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the
Liberalism of Holland fought for the freedom of the seas, that of England,
to rule the waves. English Liberals gloried in their military resistance
to Stuart despotism, while with Cromwell the first trade wars were begun,
Ireland was ruthlessly subjugated, and a great British navy founded.
<p>We can continue the story of Liberalism&#8217;s &#8220;love of peace&#8221; on to later
years. In America, Liberalism was founded on the military conflicts of
the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the bloody Civil War. On
the other hand, British Whig Liberalism was responsible both for driving
America to revolt and for preventing George III from negotiating for peace.
The Liberals of the French Revolution took the initiative in declaring
war against Austria. Nor did they hesitate to support the bloody wars of
Napoleon. Again, it was the British Liberals who unceasingly pushed the
war against Napoleon to the bitter end. If British Liberalism can take
pride in the British navy, French Liberalism is responsible for the national
army, and both in England and in France, Liberalism took to conscription.
(*7)
<p>In the nineteenth century, Liberalism was wont to claim as its own the
various wars for national independence, such as occurred in Italy, Central
Europe, the Balkans, etc. At the same time, States where Liberalism dominated
also attempted to prevent such national independent movements. The war
between Holland and Belgium is a good example, as is the crushing of the
Egyptian revolt and the Indian mutinies by British Liberalism. Through
war, too, European Liberalism compels China to drench its population with
opium.
<p>Nor must we forget that it was the Liberal Party in Great Britain that
declared war in 1914 and that it was the Liberal Lloyd George who came
out for the &#8220;knock-out blow.&#8221; So far is Liberalism divorced from war that
"The immediate cause of its downfall was Mr. Lloyd George&#8217;s threat of a
renewal of war with Turkey.&#8221; (*8) It was the Liberal Woodrow Wilson who
opened the war for the United States. Finally, European Liberalism was
responsible for the horrors of the Versailles Treaty and for the interventionary
wars against Soviet Russia. So much for the thesis of Peace under Liberal
industrialism!
<center>
<p>2</center></p>

<p>The relation of Liberalism to Pacifism varies drastically according
to whether Liberalism will be forced to pay for the war or will be the
beneficiary of it. Before Liberalism came to power in England it was very
clear that the Liberal movement had to oppose the wars of the King, which
could only still further strengthen and centralize his power against them.
<p>As William Penn put it in 1695, &#8220;Peace preserves our possessions; we
are in no danger of invasions; our trade is free and safe, and we rise
and lye down without anxiety. The rich bring out their hoards and employ
the poor manufacturers buildings and divers projections for profit and
pleasure go on. It excites industry, which brings wealth, as that gives
the means of charity and hospitality, not the lowest ornaments of a kingdom
or commonwealth&#8212;But War&#8230;&#8230; seizes all these comforts at once, and
stops the civil channel of society. The rich draw in their stock, the poor
turn soldiers, or thieves, or starve; no industry, no building, no manufactury,
little hospitality or charity; but what the peace gave, the war devours.&#8221; (*9)
<p>Thus in every respect did the rising capitalist class idealize peace
as constructive in contrast to war. In the same way the industrialists
of the Manchester School were to prove later that war could have no utilitarian
value. Turning society&#8217;s attention from peace to war meant a reduction
in the growth of science, invention, and the arts and crafts of industry.
War deprived them of their laborers who were forced to fight in the army.
It ruined certain sections of industry and created a feverish speculative
tendency that reduced all stability to a minimum. War destroyed vast quantities
of property and goods. The country that lost had to pay huge indemnities
and suffered narrowed markets. The military machine was growing increasingly
costly. Thus, merchants and manufacturers joined forces to prevent war
from disturbing investments and profits.
<p>Leaders of the Manchester School put forth several proposals for peace.
Cobden advocated a lockout by industrialists to prevent loans being given
to foreign countries for war purposes. Bentham published his <em>Plan for
an Universal and Perpetual Peace</em>, in which he called for disarmament,
abolition of secrecy in foreign relations, emancipation of colonies, and
an international court of judicature. Almost a hundred years later these
points were to be among those laid down by Woodrow Wilson.
<p>War&#8217;s brood included increase in taxation and in the national dept,
inflation of the currency, and confiscation of property. It was against
the heavy taxation engendered by the dynastic wars that Liberalism had
revolted in England in the seventeenth century and France and America in
the eighteenth. Liberalism pointed out that, with the Treaty of Rhyswick
ending the war of 1697, the national dept first rose in England and thereafter
grew exceedingly rapidly. It is true this growth of the national dept provided
a fruitful market for investment for the financiers and moneyed men, but
payment of the interest and principal eventually had to be taken out of
industry and from the pockets of all sections of the population. The wealthy
capitalists, especially the industrialists who were in need of capital
themselves and who as yet had not obtained their share in political control
of the government, did not feel that war expenses were justified.
<p>War also meant the inevitable growth of the power of the State. To carry
on a war a strong government was needed. In back of the military had to
stand another army of bureaucrats and thus, not merely the host of military
parasites grew increasingly, but State bureaucracy, State control, and
centralization as well. Furthermore, it was precisely State diplomacy and
military affairs that the capitalists, inured to the counting-house factory,
had traditionally left to the nobility. The more these sections of the
State grew, the stronger it seemed would be the power of the ruling classes
of the old order which had opposed them.
<p>In England, the victory of Liberalism had been a victory for parliament,
not only over the King, but over the people as well. We have noted how,
under such circumstances, the Liberals had avoided theories of violence
to take to doctrines of rationalism and tolerance. The Liberals had not
fought much in the revolution, although they had become the beneficiaries
of it. Once in power it was to their advantage for parliamentary cliques
to adopt an attitude of tolerance in order to maintain the status quo.
Their confidence in the power of persuasion and reason was increased by
their hold on the forces of government. The Liberal theory of natural law
and social contract had enunciated the belief that in primitive nature
men were generally good and peaceful, these honorable men having come together
without compulsion to form the contract of the State. The world thus started
with pacifism and the beauties of reason; in this state of affairs it was
the destiny of Liberalism to continue. Not by conquest, but by contract
would the Liberals win!
<p>With the consolidation of power of Liberalism in England in the eighteenth
century, the plea for peace was supported by other weighty reasons. England
was becoming the workshop of the world. It did not need war to enjoy prosperity.
The cheap prices of its goods proved far superior to cannon in battering
down tariff walls. Given peaceful conditions and equal trade treaties,
English factories and merchants would undersell all competitors. Moreover,
England had become the great place for transshipment of goods, and controlled
a goodly portion of the worlds commerce. Free trade and a free hand to
reduce the cost of production were the needs of the capitalist, if only
the State would let him alone he felt he could quickly dominate the world.
Principles of <em>laissez-faire</em> and of utilitarianism connected themselves
closely with doctrines of Pacifism.
<p>Besides, the more England was at peace the more could she stir up war
among her neighbors to ruin her competitors. Then she could sell both sides
goods to shoot down each other. Peace was synonymous with escape from the
convulsions of Europe and thus was profitable to England in many ways.
<p>If British Liberals, then, went to war, it was always with the declared
pacific motive of curbing the military machine of the enemy that threatened
to end free trade and low costs for the British capitalists. The struggle
against Napoleon was a struggle against his militant army and against his
embargo legislation. The Napoleonic Wars helped English Liberalism in several
ways. They consolidated the power of the Liberal government; they raised
the prestige of the new capitalist classes which had always controlled
the navy which now was the main British arm against Napoleon. Finally,
while warring against the French, the Liberals of England could crush the
aspirations of the lower classes striving to express their own radical
needs.
<p>The French Liberals were placed in an entirely different situation than
the British. Their task of conquering the market and taking trade away
from the British was yet to be accomplished. Thus their slogan had to be,
"Make way for the French.&#8221; To attain this they needed governmental help.
French theories of <em>laissez-faire</em> by no means took on the form of
political struggle against a centralized State. National State and national
army were too important to the Liberal business man not to be whole-heartedly
supported. French Liberalism, from the start, was deeply colored with an
active militarism.
<p>The terrific shake-up in society engendered during the French Revolutionary
Wars had tumbled the wealth of the old aristocracy and royalty into the
laps of the Liberal-Radical <em>nouveau-riche</em>. How could French Liberalism
as heir to these favors fear war? In England, on the contrary, a chief
argument against war was the social upheaval it brought in its train. In
France, only when Napoleon had been defeated and the French had been bled
white, did pacifism make itself known to Liberalism, although the basis
for this pacifism was not so much derogation of the military as fear of
the poor. Peace and harmony were preached so as to provide the basis for
a theory uniting all classes under the leadership of the wealthy Liberals
in power after 1830.
<p>German Liberalism took to pacifism for the same reason that the French
took to war. The Wars of the French Revolution brought defeat to Germany
as they brought victory to France. Overwhelmed and devastated by the power
of the French, the impotent and divided German Liberals could only pray
for peace. So long as the German army was invading France, Liberals like
Goethe could go along enthusiastically with the generals, but when the
German army was thrown back with great loss by the French Revolutionists,
"He returned home with a shuddering horror of war, more convinced than
ever that wars and revolutions were not worth their price and that the
highest duty of rulers was to render them unnecessary.&#8221; (*10)
<p>The French Liberals rode high and mighty on the backs of the masses;
the German Liberals feared the masses more than anything else, and as the
French events had brought home to them the intimate connection between
revolution and war, they turned from war as they turned from revolution.
In the end, the mean character of German Liberalism prevented it from doing
anything but worry about the tariff.
<p>Excellently illustrating German Liberalism&#8217;s fears is Immanuel Kant&#8217;s
<em>Perpetual Peace</em>. Despite its sanctimonious air of uttering eternal
truths limited by neither time nor space, its close connection with the
petty interests of the princes is seen in almost every line. Kant&#8217;s <em>Perpetual
Peace </em>merely perpetuates the bankrupt Holy Roman Empire and makes it
"universal.&#8221; <p>According to Kant, to achieve everlasting peace, (1) no independent
State, small or great, should be acquired by another through inheritance,
exchange, purchase, or deed of gift; (2) no State should forcibly interfere
with the constitution and government of another; (3) no secret reservations
in treaties should be made or State debts contracted for external State
enterprises. Then standing armies eventually will cease to exist, and,
if the civic constitution of every State is like that of the Holy Roman
Empire, presto, the professor guarantees us perpetual peace!

<p>* * * *</center></p>

<p>In America, the pacifism inherent in American life and so thoroughly
connected with Liberalism sprang from entirely different sources than those
of Europe. No one in America could say that war does not pay. Always the
Americans had been successful in whatever war they had engaged, whether
against the Indians, the British, Mexico, or Spain. Nor were the wars very
costly, amounts expended indeed being ridiculously insignificant in comparison
to the prizes won. Pacifism, therefore, could not be placed on the foundation
of utilitarianism or on the ground that war spelled revolution or ruin.
(*11) On the other hand, the American, unlike the French, could not turn
to militarism.
<p>Militarism means masses. In the early days, in America, the masses were
discrete as individuals. American society was entirely too porous to provide
the close contacts on which militarism thrives. War spells discipline;
Americans did not know what discipline meant. War means duty; Americans
recognized no duty but only their own rights. War is an act of society;
to the Americans, society hardly existed.
<p>In America, there was simply nobody to fight. A comparatively empty
continent stretched out before the colonists. Conquest consisted in labor.
On both sides extended vast oceans separating the Americans from all the
civilizations of the Old World. With such isolation from the class struggles
and national pressures of Europe and Asia, coupled with a wide dispersion
of the general population enjoying relative prosperity, there was no possibility
of military affairs engrossing the attention of the majority of the people
for any length of time. Americans had their economic problems without having
to bother with political. The American could be aggressive and militant
without being militarist; this is amply shown by the crime rate in the
United States.
<p>The same forces creating the extremely puny State in America, the unique
situation of classlessness, the widespread equalitarian distribution of
property, at least in comparison to Europe, the belated accumulation of
capital, and finally, the rampant individualism that marked everything
in America, completely prevented militarist tendencies and laid a natural
basis for pacifism. Even to this day the American army is entirely voluntary
and mercenary, not so much to save expense&#8212;indeed, the American government
is exceedingly lavish in its expenditures upon the small army it has, ---
as owing to the fact there is no possible excuse for a larger force.
<p>Not that the American did not praise and honor his military leaders.
The Presidencies of Washington, Jackson, Tyler, Grant, Theodore Roosevelt,
amply illustrate the leading role military leaders have played in politics
in America. But these were generals without an army. Besides, they were
generally farmers or business men playing at war.
<p>Soldiers entering the army have treated their job as others would a
civil profession or trade; in both cases they are to be paid at a certain
salary or scale of wages. In the American Revolution the officers demanded
half-pay for life. The soldiers who fought in the Civil War organized themselves
into a powerful &#8220;Grand Army of the Republic&#8221; to obtain life pensions, as
did the veterans of the Spanish American War. After the World War, in no
country in the world did there arise a situation in regard to bonus payments
such as prevailed in America. So exceptional has military duty been considered
in American life that those who are engaged in it feel they must be heavily
recompensed for being taken away from normal, ordinary occupations.
<p>In the United States, military affairs have been completely subordinated
to civil machinery. This conception is emphatically embedded in the Constitution
of the United States. (*12) And all parties to the Federal Government,
from the President, who is Commander-in-chief of the armed forces, to the
judiciary, have jealously guarded the superiority of peace time machinery.
<p>For a long time, militarism was completely non-essential to maintaining
the property and leadership of the American ruling class. Here it was possible
to write: &#8220;In Europe, but not in the United States, &#8216;big business men,&#8217;
not satisfied with being captains of industry in the world of commerce,
have tried to drive the political chariot, and have often enough succeeded
in overturning it. In the United States they prefer a political semi-obscurity
even though they openly display the splendors of industrial leadership.&#8221; (*13)
<p>The lack of military activity in American life enabled the capitalists
to concentrate entirely upon economic forces and the accumulation of capital.
This peaceful industry could take full advantage of European convulsions.
The Napoleonic Wars greatly developed American shipping, trade, manufactures,
and agriculture. The World War placed America in the world&#8217;s leading position.
The policy of being inextricably involved in European political and military
affairs brought handsome dividends to American capitalism and formed a
material basis for its pacifist pretensions.
<p>In the eighteenth century, the rationale of pacifism in America cloaked
itself with arguments from morality and religion. War was un-Christain,
said the Quakers; it was inhumanitarian and immoral. It meant misery, disease,
and death. It destroyed the productive forces, particularly labor, so highly
priced in America. The generally prevailing prosperity had allowed humanitarianism
to become a deep-felt philosophy in this country.
<p>Thus the wars conducted by America have always been in the name of humanity,
either to build the New World, to free the slaves, to free Cuba and the
Philippines or other oppressed nationalities, or to free humanity from
war and make the world safe for democracy. Only the Americans could have
entered an imperialist war under the slogan, &#8220;End all war forever.&#8221; <p>Pacifist humanitarianism played the same propaganda role in mobilizing
the Americans for war as the idea of spreading &#8220;kulter&#8221; did in Germany.
If the Germans had philosophy and no humanity, the Americans had plenty
of humanity and no philosophy. The British fought for their Empire. With
the American, imperialism and humanitarianism have been theoretically identified
for a long time.

<p><b>3</b></center></p>

<p>Between the Napoleonic Wars and the great World War capitalism enjoyed
a relatively prolonged period of &#8220;peaceful&#8221; and organic growth. As this
was precisely the period of the domination of Liberalism in governmental
affairs in certain important countries, Liberalism has not neglected to
take full credit for bringing about this peacefulness. It is true that
during this period there were approximately forty wars of importance fought
throughout the world, some of them, like the Franco-Prussian War of 1870
and the American Civil War of 1860, considerably costly. (*14) Nevertheless,
these wars were not too detrimental to the growing industrial societies
controlled by Liberalism. Most of the wars were of short duration and were
waged in the far corners of the earth. They were localized and spasmodic.
These wars could be considered as merely interpreting the regular regime
of peace, and could not refute the claims of Liberalism to pacifism.
<p>Furthermore, the Liberals could demonstrate the progressive character
of these wars. By means of them the Chinese walls of Asia were battered
down, opening the way for grandiose development of both continents. Through
such wars, also, the &#8220;dark continent&#8221; of Africa was exposed to the light
of nineteenth century civilization. And so, just as Liberalism was wont
to take pride in the wars that overwhelmed the <em>ancien re&#8217;gime </em>of
feudalism, so did it hail these &#8220;Liberal&#8221; wars to insure the domination
of free trade and industrialism all over the world.
<p>In the nineteenth century, the wars conducted by capitalism acted generally
as a stimulant to business rather than as a threat against it. Since the
wars were not too prolonged and not too general, and therefore not too
destructive, they could serve to tone up capitalist society. The wars of
Liberal business were but draconic acts to brush aside the obstacles obstructing
the development of peace-time economic and social forces. They enormously
accelerated and advanced the technological and industrial development of
society as a whole. Those that suffered were the so-called backward countries
which were being opened up to capitalism, but these backward countries
at the moment had no great progressive role to play. The countries that
prospered were the countries which had the most progressive mission to
perform.
<p>The wars of Liberalism were simply another form of the competition of
business men and of nations for world markets and control. War is the quintessence
of competition, doing quickly what peace would perform more slowly if permitted
by the political relations of the backward countries. Military war is but
concentrated peace; peace is diluted war. Military battles culminate the
price wars of competition.
<p>Nor can we say that the wars of Liberalism were more costly than its
peace. &#8220;Indeed, peaceful industry demands in the long run a heavier toll
even in life and blood than does war. It suffices to note the physique
of the thousands&#8212;women as well as men&#8212;who pour through the factory
gates of the North; the health of the children left at home; the kind of
life that industry involves for millions, to say nothing of the casualty
statistics in railroading, fishing, mining, and seamanship, to be persuaded
of the fact.&#8221; (*15)
<p>It is well for those who disclaim against the terrors of war, to reflect
upon the horrors of peace, not only upon the toiling masses of the prosperous
countries, but especially upon the conquered colonial peoples. The many
millions of Indians who were driven to death, wiped out annually by efficient
Manchester power-loom production, the countless millions of China who were
drawn to an early death by avaricious exploitation under European capitalists,
the millions of Africans who perished under the whips of colonial masters
--- these speak eloquently of the fact that peace is not less dreadful
than war. Indeed, capitalist peace is industrial war, while war is only
military peace.
<p>Historically, Liberalism could justify its wars as being in the long
run humane. Above all, civilization was saved time, since Liberal wars
hitched history to a locomotive rather than to a stage coach. The countries
that won in war would generally have dominated and did dominate in peace-time.
Political might was great only when supported by economic might. What mattered
it historically whether the tariff walls of backward technique were blown
up by cannon in a year or torn down by cheaper prices eventually in twenty
years? Machinofacture, in any case, whether flanked by cannon or not, was
destined to wipe out hand labor. Peaceful methods would only have slowed
up history; at least by war a modicum of that most important material dimension
known as &#8220;time&#8221; was won for all humanity forever.
<p>Such being the case, peace could be praised only by those who stand
to be defeated in war or who need time to recuperate from previous defeats,
or by those who are glutted with victory and can gorge no more but fear
their conquests will be taken from them by the hungry ones left outside
the feast. In the former position is Germany today. In the latter are England
and France, masters of the League of Nations. With the failure of the League
of Nations to keep the peace, the utopian plans of Bentham, Kant, and all
the other &#8220;thinkers&#8221; of Liberalism come to an Ignominious end.

<p>Only the people who were doomed to fight and die in Liberalism&#8217;s wars,
namely, the petty-bourgeoisie and workers, protested against them, and
as Big Business abandoned pacifism in the twentieth century, it was the
common people who took a prominent part in the cry for peace. Pacifism
became attached to religious Leftism and middle-class and proletarian political
movements. The petty-bourgeoisie formed its peace societies. In the ranks
of the proletariat there arose vigorous anti-militarist agitation.
<p>Petty-bourgeois religious movements naturally took humanitarianism as
their keynote. Wherever the petty proprietor dominated a church, love became
the essence of religion. God was no longer a mighty task-master; God was
Love. It was love that was to rule the world. Thus the bedroom arrangements
of the city petty-bourgeois shopkeeper, employee, etc., became idealized
in religion.
<p>These people, totally foreign to the theory of war and unaccustomed
to the physical hardships of industrial life, shrank from the violence
and murder of warfare. Using the Biblical enjoinment, &#8220;Thou shalt not kill,&#8221; with the slogan, &#8220;God is Love,&#8221; pacifism worked out its programs with the
miserable orientalism of Mahatma Ghandi as its standard in the midst of
stained-glass windows and the subdued strains of the church organ to give
the proper emotional setting for its noble cadences.
<p>In America, peace-at-any-price pacifism became the rage. The Reverend
John Haynes Holmes could write: &#8220;Pacifism in other words, is the cause
supreme. Not merely a means for the attainment of other ends, it is its
own sufficient end. For all else is won if this be won; and all else is
lost if this be lost. This is the reason for pacifism; and the reason why
I had rather die for this cause than live for any other.&#8221; (*16) During
peace-time, Protestant churches vied with the Catholic in Pacifist proclamations.
John Haynes Holmes&#8217; fervent oratory was no doubt in part evoked by his
bitter competition with Pope Pius XI&#8217;s Encyclical calling for peace.
<p>In the Left Wing of the Liberal Pacifists is to be found a Woman&#8217;s International
League for Peace and Freedom, an international grouping, with headquarters
at Geneva, publishing <em>The Pax International. </em>The program of this
League contains the following points: (1) universal disarmament; (2) solution
of conflicts by (a) recognition of human solidarity, (b) council and arbitration,
(c) world co-operation and world recognition; (3) &#8220;to establish social
and political economic justice for all without distinction of sex, race,
class, or creed."; (4) to oppose every kind of war, exploitation, and oppression.
<p>With this sort of a program, the Left Wing middle class has hoped to
tie labor to its pacifism. The League of course, has supported the Kellogg
Peace Pact and the League of Nations, and has been against the policy of
military training in schools and colleges. It has claimed education must
be the chief instrument to gain peace. The idea is to instill in the people&#8217;s
minds a hatred of war.
<p>The sweet women of the Pax International evidently have believed the
masses do not know enough about war or are so morally perverse as to like
it. However, armed with Pax education, reason would ultimately triumph
and the dove of peace fly away no more. Alas, people find it so hard to
reason!
<p>These people have made no distinction between progressive and reactionary
wars, or between imperialist and colonial wars, or between national and
civil wars. They are against all war in general, and have pledged themselves
to refuse to fight in any case.
<p>The extreme Left Wing has organized a War Resisters League and War Resisters
International, with the following program: &#8220;The method of war resistance
is the continuous organization of men and women for a refusal to all support
of war whether by bearing arms, subscribing to war funds, or performing
noncombatant service as an aid to winning the war. Its power will grow
in direct ratio to the number enrolled for this refusal, a number small
now while the Movement counts thousands rather than millions, but greater
with every man or woman who enrolls&#8230;. It is the deliberate refusal of
this popular support that will be able to put force behind international
treaties and eventually abolish war and armament, and the War Resisters
International is already in a position to prevent at least the giving of
100% support.&#8221; <p>The Liberal Pacifist movement generally has completely failed to analyze
the relationship of war to peace or to understand the economic contradictions
of capitalist society inevitably evoking the social and national antagonisms
leading to wars of all sorts. It has failed utterly to meet the arguments
either of businessmen or of militarists. Expressing its hatred of war on
merely religious grounds, it has attempted to fight war by means of persuasion
and reason and to enlighten humanity as to the values of peace.
<p>The Radical Pacifists, tried to transcend mere thought and get into
action. Their action took the form of advocating individual resistance
to war, of refusal to pay taxes, to buy Liberty bonds, etc. Their program
has embraced such ideas as complete disarmament as the sole way to end
war. These Radicals have also essayed to connect their pacifism with vague
formulations about the coming end of capitalism.
<p>This pacifism whether of Liberal or Radical variety, was only part of
the Welfare-Liberalism prevalent in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. Later, tremendous devastation of the World War was to fall heavily
upon them. Then, sections of these groups turned decidedly to the Left,
and as there was borne home to them the meaning of imperialism and Fascism,
they learned how to use Socialist and Communist phrases.
<p>It must not be imagined that religious, Liberal, or Radical pacifism
is entirely divorced from militarism. Quite the contrary, paradoxically
as it may seem, the pacifist movement often plays directly into the hands
of militarism. Ministers who, in time of peace, prated about love, when
war begins become most efficient agents for the preparation of cannon fodder,
employing the very argument of pacifism to &#8220;Turn the other cheek&#8221; to induce
men to obey the conscription laws. (*17) It is the same with many pacifist
societies which, though they love peace, love law more.
<p>Conversely, organizations which ardently support war, immediately after
a war reform themselves into pacifist societies. A good example of this
in the United States is the Conference for the Cause and Cure of War, organized
in 1925 and holding annual meetings in Washington. This Conference is made
up of precisely the same elements that formed the patriotic network of
conferences of women&#8217;s organizations organized during the World War under
the direct supervision and control of the Federal Government, (*18) and
in time of war can be found linked up to the Women&#8217;s Patriotic Conference
composed of such elements as the Daughters of the American Revolution and
the Ladies Auxiliaries of the various veterans societies, etc.
<p>The World War gave rise to a tremendous impoverishment of the people,
loss of life and property. In England, for example, between 1913 and 1932
taxes grew more than five times. The income tax jumped from ls.2d per pound
to 5s, the super tax from ls.4d. to 8s.3d. The tax on beer in 1932 was
twelve times the pre-war rate. Even the wealthy have felt the strain; in
1933 over two-thirds of the income of the richest taxpayers was consumed
in taxes. (*19)
<p>The national dept too, became enormously increased. The war dept of
Great Britain increased thirteen times over 1913, now being about forty
billion dollars. The national dept of the United States has jumped from
one billion immediately before the War to over twenty-one billion immediately
after, and has steadily increased until in 1936 it approximates forty billion
dollars. Other countries have been forced into open bankruptcy or , as
in the case of France and Italy, into partial cancellation of all debts
by inflation of the currency. The heavy weight of taxation and of the national
debt, as well as the wiping out of savings by inflation, etc., has fallen
squarely upon the people, making them realize more than ever that in the
twentieth century war does not pay.
<p>But most important of all, the World War brought in its wake many people&#8217;s
and proletarian revolutions, immensely frightening to the middle class
pacifist as to the capitalists generally. With the cry &#8220;stop war or be
consumed by revolution,&#8221; schemes of total disarmament have been proposed
as an immediate panacea not only to end war but to secure the stability
of the whole social order. Above all, the working class must be disarmed;
in the International Disarmament Conferences, the Pacifist &#8220;Communist&#8221; delegate from Russia, Litvinoff, made sure to point that his &#8220;complete&#8221; disarmament plans by no means included the disarmament of police or colonial
armies, or other State forces used against the people.
<p>Here again we see that pacifists are only the counterpart to militarists.
Both sections work hard for &#8220;law and order,&#8221; and in their own way nicely
supplement each other. This is beautifully illustrated by the farcical
Disarmament Conferences held since the World War. The pacifists idealized
these conferences, praising the statesmen who proposed them. The conferences
themselves were only military maneuvers, each militarist using &#8220;his&#8221; pacifists
to prove that always the &#8220;other countries&#8221; wanted war. Each militarist
turned pacifist to put forth schemes to disarm &#8220;the enemy&#8221; and to mobilize
his own adulatory pacifists for the next war.

<p>When middle classes turned to pacifism, the working classes turned to
anti-militarism. Proletarian Anarchism, Syndicalism, and revolutionary
Socialism turned violently against capitalist war. After all, these groups
furnished the chief regiments of cannon fodder and feared the warfare more
than any other. Their anti-war activity was only part of the general struggle
for emancipation of the working class.
<p>None of these groups, however, could escape from theories of pacifism.
They were not able to understand the laws of social dynamics. The Anarchists
turned to Tolstoyan pacifism while they built dreams of mutual aid co-operatives,
or they adopted the Liberal methods of individual objection. The Syndicalists
proposed the general strike as a method of stopping war, as though the
peaceful diluted economic action of their general strike could liquidate
at the start the terrific concentrated political violence of war. The parliamentary
Socialists adopted the theory that war can be stopped by the ballot-box
and by theories of international co-operation and total disarmament. Later
on, the degenerated Communists of the Stalinist variety would propose on
the rostrum of the Disarmament Conferences the old pacifist utopia of universal
disarmament as the &#8220;cure&#8221; for war.
<p>Like Liberalism, all of these proletarian movements prove bankrupt in
stopping the all-consuming development of militarism and war.
