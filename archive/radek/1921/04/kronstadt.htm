<p>A great joy seized white-guards all over the world when on the
2nd of
March, news reached the outside world that that the sailors of
Kronstadt had risen up against the Soviets. &ldquo;I have made you,
and I shall kill you&rdquo; &ndash; that was the caption below
a cartoon that appeared in a big broadsheet in Paris, showing a tall,
lanky sailor pointing his revolver at Trotsky. &ldquo;The odious
sailors of Kronstadt, who brought revolution into every corner of
Russia, the maniacal enemies of the bourgeoisie, have broken from the
Soviet government. Upon whom will the government support itself
now?&rdquo; That is what was repeated by all the possible,
imaginable organs of the Russian counter-revolution. And more than one
was already banking on the end of the Soviet government. But things
didn&rsquo;t work out as they had expected. The Kronstadt uprising,
just as they proudly declared it, they fled into the land of Canaan,
into Finland, where grass had just begun to grow on the graves of
30,000 proletarians murdered by the Finnish Whites, they abandoned the
sailors to the revolutionary tribunals of Soviet Russia. Nevertheless,
the crushing of this mutiny by military force did not erase its
significance. The real character of the Kronstadt uprising does not
only cast light on the current situation in Russia, it also illuminates
at the same time one of the most important problems of the world
revolution in general: the problem of the relationship between the
Communist Party and the mass of the proletariat and the form of the
dictatorship: dictatorship of the Party or dictatorship of the class
(to employ the customary expression, which is in any case inexact).
</p>

<h3>
1 &ndash; The Uprising</h3>

<p>
The Kronstadt uprising was not a local event, although it naturally
bore numerous local characteristics. The latter consisted first of all
in the fact that it was not provoked by a very high level of material
deprivation. The sailors of Kronstadt live better than the rest of the
army or the working class, they are well dressed and their other
material conditions of life are without a doubt better than the average
of those experienced by the rest of the Russian proletariat. The local
discontent of the sailors was directed first and foremost against the
discipline and order established by the Soviet government. That is
expressly confirmed by the central organ of the Whites, <span style="font-style: italic;">Les
Derni&egrave;res Nouvelles</span> of Milyukov, who writes,
according to a
refugee sailor, that the discontent had already manifested itself the
year before and that it had been stirred up by the radical measures
taken by the Soviet government in order to arrest the degeneration of
the fleet. Everywhere, but especially in Russia, sailors have always
been a particularly ill-disciplined element and given to excess. It is
a fatal consequence of their life and of the union which they form with
their ship: once they come ashore, they run riot.</p>

<p>
As a result of this undisciplined spirit and of the great number of
highly qualified workers among their ranks, the Kronstadt sailors an
eminent role in the revolutions of both 1905 and 1917 as agents of the
destruction of the bourgeois state. These highly qualified workers
acted as a moral cement, transforming the indiscipline of the mass into
a revolutionary factor.</p>

<p>
But these revolutionary proletarian elements have been singularly
weakened during the last three years. The former crews of Kronstadt
have given the Soviet government thousands upon thousands of fighters,
who, in all the armies, in all the services, have played the most
glorious role in the defence and the reconstruction of Soviet Russia.
Only an insignificant of these former militants have remained at
Kronstadt and all of these now occupy command positions, they
constitute the Communist apparatus of the fleet and it is against them
that the new crews have rebelled. Where have these new crews of the
fleet been recruited from? Finland and the Baltic provinces no longer
belonging to Russia, there only remains Southern Russia and the coasts
of the Black Sea. In the main, the fleet is now composed of peasant
elements from the Ukraine. Before, specialist sailors were principally
metalworkers; the necessity of keeping the latter in war industries
meant that many young bourgeois who had had to interrupt their studies
as a result either of the war or the revolution, were attracted into
the fleet by the relatively good conditions that it offered them. If we
add to this the fact that the Communist organisation in Petrograd has
been badly weakened by the departure of tens of thousands of members
going to literally guard the Revolution in all corners of Russia, we
can understand that the work of politically educating the sailors had
greatly suffered. Finally, we must say that the Kronstadt sailors had a
very clear idea of their own strength. They were still bathed in the
halo of their revolutionary past; they guarded the gates of Petrograd;
their little isle is like the Helgoland of revolutionary Russia. Such
are the local particularities which made the Kronstadt uprising
possible and which gave it its original colour. In a general sense and
in the first instance, it is the discontent of the peasant and the
Ukrainian peasant which is expressed in this mutiny. After the
liquidation of the fronts, the majority of sailors were off on leave at
home. They had heard everywhere that there was no longer any danger
from the Whites, and they had been struck by complaints about food
requisitioning. In the Ukraine people spoke of the merciless struggle
waged by the Soviet government against the bands which pillaged, burned
and cut the rail-roads under the Anarchist flag of Makhno. More than
one sailor never returned at all from leave, and some went over to
Makhno&rsquo;s side. In an article that a fugitive sailor wrote in
Milyukov&rsquo;s newspaper, to characterise the uprising at
Kronstadt, he frankly recognised that Makhno&rsquo;s calls to
pillage pleased the sailors a lot and in any case played on their
natures (edition of 17th March 1921). A characteristic fact is that
four members of the &ldquo;revolutionary committee&rdquo; of
Kronstadt are the children of Ukrainian peasants and that the more
influential amongst them, Petritchenko, had been nicknamed
&ldquo;Petlioura&rdquo; by his friends.</p>

<p>
The peasant believes that he has nothing more to fear from feudal
land-owners. He now demands of the Soviet government to reduce the
demands placed upon him. The same tendency has had an impact on the
little island of Kronstadt. The son of the peasant, held there on a
ship under a rigid discipline, saw in the Communists in the fleet,
people who were demanding from him submission to discipline, when no
more Entente squadrons were to be seen. And the Communists who were
demanding this discipline of him were the same who were demanding the
peasant give up his grain. At the same time the Kronstadt sailor feels
himself to be a born revolutionary, he does not have the slightest
intention of aiding the capitalist, the Tsarist general or the fat
landlord to regain their dominion. His protest against the demands
placed on the peasant as well as against revolutionary discipline and
order, is not in his opinion an expression of a counter-revolutionary
tendency; on the contrary, this protest his, he thinks, surely an
extension of the October Revolution. &ldquo;We made the revolution,
we proclaimed Soviet power; but who exercises power now? The Communist
Party. It&rsquo;s the Soviets who should hold and exercise power,
it is the masses. We must found a real Soviet
power.&rdquo;&nbsp; This tendency had been determined by the
public discussions over all the questions which had accumulated over
three years of war within the Communist Party [cette tendance avait
&eacute;t&eacute; determine par la discussion publique
maintenant engage de toutes les questions accumul&eacute;es pendant
trios ann&eacute;es de guerre au sein du Parti Communiste]. In the
Communist press and in Communist meetings, it was openly said that over
the course of long years of struggle the organism of the Soviets had
developed a parasitic, bureaucratic tendency. One often heard talk of
the necessity of purging the Communist Party of all its careerist
elements. Kronstadt had heard all that, and their essentially peasant
psychology (albeit transformed by the conditions of life as sailors)
conceived of these problems as being inherent in Soviet Russia.
[Cronstadt avait entendu tout cela, et la psychologie essentiellement
paysanne, mais transform&eacute;e par les conditions de vie, des
matelots concut ces defaults comme inherents a la Russie des Soviets]</p>

<p>
In this general conception, there is a mixture of anarchism which
rejects all bureaucracy and centralisation, of SR-ism, and a
syndicalism which affirms that the worker, like the peasant, should be
master of what he himself makes. All these tendencies are summed up in
the demand for the re-election of the Soviets, re-election which would
free them from the influence of the Communist Party in general. The
syndicalist side has seduced a part of the workers of Kronstadt, for
whom the direct domination of the proletariat over all factories is the
same as the appropriation by the worker of the product of his work; the
legal right to relieve his poverty through the sale of the instruments
of his work and, eventually, of the produce of his labour as well.
What&rsquo;s more, the people at Kronstadt were isolated. They had
heard talk of peasant movements about which exaggerated tales were
being spread (they received White newspapers from Finland); they had
heard of the poverty and the strikes which gripped Petrograd, among
workers who had hoped that with the end of the war would come an
improvement in their situation. In this atmosphere, the clandestine
organisations of Right SRs and Left SRs, of anarchists, of Mensheviks
and, in the background and unbeknownst to the sailors, the Monarchist
counter-revolutionary conspiracy of the artillery commander Kozlovski,
all these forces acted efficiently. The sailors did not think to rise
up, they assembled in stormy meetings where they met with the commissar
of the fleet Kouzmin, much-respected by them, and Zinoviev. On the very
day of the uprising, Kalinin, president of the Executive Central
Committee, to which they accorded great weight and importance, spoke to
them in Anchor Square, in Kronstadt. At mid-day, the sailors&rsquo;
delegates met to discuss the re-election of the Soviet. During the
discussion, news arrived that great detachments of soldiers were
marching against them. This was nothing but a provocation, the means
chosen by the SRs or even the Monarchists to transform the conflict
into an armed confrontation. In order to guarantee themselves against
any surprise, the sailors established patrols, it was insinuated to
them that these would be useless, that the Petrograd Soviet would
attack anyway, as the Communists did not want to concede the
re-election; they had to, so the sailors were told, take some hostages
in order to assure the re-election, i.e. arresting all the Communists
and in preventing people from Petrograd from coming to Kronstadt. The
sailors placed an embargo on Petrograd and arrested the Communists. The
struggle is provoked. The Soviet government naturally could not
tolerate the arrest of its representatives, the seizure of the fortress
which guarded the approaches to Petrograd. The radio-telegraphic
station of the dreadnought Petropavlos sent coded telegrams to Reval
and to Finland. It is clear that there was in Kronstadt a military
staff for which the re-election of the soviets was merely a pretext,
and which is capable of turning Kronstadt over to the Entente. The
Finnish Whites hurried to make contact with Kronstadt. The Soviet
government ordered the sailors to lay down their arms, but they hope
that their example will be followed in Petrograd and Moscow. Their
leaders promise them that in a few days the government will be obliged
to hold new general elections which will end with a Soviet government
without a party, a Soviet government which will put everything right
and satisfy everyone. The peasant will no longer have to give over his
produce, and the worker will no longer be hungry. Finally the sailors
are persuaded that after rising up against the government they will be
held to account for their actions, and they stiffen their resistance.
The government cannot wait any longer. It cannot for the simple reason
that when the debacle spreads across the gulf of Finland and the Neva,
the counter-revolutionaries will be able to push the sailors into an
assault on Petrograd. And fate follows its course. The Gordian knot
must be cut by the sword. Troops brought from the front, led by the
attack battalion of trainee Red Army officers and delegates from the
Party Congress, set out one night over the ice of the Gulf of Finland
which is already beginning to break up. &ldquo;Infantry has never
before or since fought warships on ice&rdquo;, proclaimed the
soldiers of the Red Army. The example of Voroshilov, of Zatonsky and of
Boubnov and so on, the example of the students of the military
colleges, led the troops on and by daybreak they were on the firm
ground of Kronstadt in the fire of the street-fighting against the
insurgents. The resistance was bloody, but not as much as it could have
been given the weapons that Kronstadt had at its disposal. During the
final days the faith of victory had been shaken among the sailors and
most likely even faith in the justice of their cause. This was above
all because the counter-revolution, at first hidden in the background,
acted more and more openly. The SR Tchernov imposed on the sailors the
demand for the Constituent Assembly [&ldquo;la
Constituante&rdquo;]. From Finland arrived, as representatives of
the Red Cross, authentic Russian Whites, with the captain of the vessel
Wilkins at their head, whom the old sailors knew as a military tyrant
and who had only been able to escape their vengeance in 1917 by fleeing
abroad. All this enlightened the masses and sapped confidence in the
correctness of their cause. Kozlovsky&rsquo;s people demanded more
and more obedience to their orders, because without discipline the
defence of the positions could not be assured. Their spies in Petrograd
informed them that their uprising had not only failed to bring the mass
of the workers along with it, but on the contrary had singularly
repulsed them, such that the factories where dissension and ferment had
been strongest, had now gone back to work having heard the cannon from
Kronstadt.</p>

<p>
Thus was Kronstadt stormed. The dead were still being buried when White
newspapers arrived from Paris, Berlin and Prague, and it was seen then
just how well the Soviet government was right to not consider the
insurrection as the beginning of a third revolution but to brand it
simply as a new counter-revolutionary attack.</p>

<h3>2 &ndash; The New Plan of the Counter-revolution</h3>

<p>
Once the Russian counter-revolutionaries received news of the uprising,
they forgot about the abyss separating them from Kronstadt. Savinkov,
aide to Kerensky, who had had 10,000 peasants shot on the Galician
front when they refused to take part in the murderous June Offensive of
1917, Savinkov, who in his Warsaw newspaper Svoboda, printed on Polish
government money, boasts (24th February) "I fight against the
Bolsheviks, I fight alongside those who have already struggled with
Kolchak, Denikin, Wrangel and even Petlioura, strange as that may
seem.", Savinkov, friend of Balakhovitch, the hero of the anti-Jewish
pogroms of White Russia, wrote in his paper that the sailors of
Kronstadt had absolved their sins thanks to their latest rising. "when
the cruiser Aurora fired on Petrograd [an imaginary event] it was an
expression of repentance for the sin committed on the 25th of October
1917 with the bombardment of the Winter Palace, the seat of Kerensky's
ministry." The Roul of Berlin, the organ of the right wing of the Cadet
Party, wrote "The uprising of Kronstadt is scared, because it is an
uprising against the idea of the November revolution". The Society of
Russian Industrialists and Financiers of Paris, when they heard the
news from Kronstadt, decided to not worry about the extremist demands
or the primitive cause of the mutiny ["les revendications extremistes
cause primitive de la mutinerie"] because its essential point was that
"the sailors were for the overthrow of the Communist government"
[<span style="font-style: italic;">Derni&egrave;res
Nouvelles de Paris</span>, 8th March]. </p>

<p>
The Russian banks, with the former Tsarist minister of finance
Kokovtsev at their head, began to collect money for Kronstadt.
Goutchkov, the head of the Russian imperialist party, got in contact
with the English and American governments to obtain food supplies. </p>

<p>
The American and French governments immediately asked their agents in
Helsingfors and Estonia to do all they could to provision the rioters
of Kronstadt.</p>

<p>
The counter-revolutionaries understood with an extraordinary clarity
and breadth of mind the deeper significance of the events of Kronstadt.
Milyukov's paper <span style="font-style: italic;">Derni&egrave;res
Nouvelles</span> as well as Bourtzev's
Cause Commune did not stop at offering immediate and categorical
support for the sailors at Kronstadt, they also elaborated a tactical
plan regarding the [acceptation] adoption of the demands of Kronstadt.
This tactic was based on the recognition that every
counter-revolutionary attack was doomed to failure as soon as it began
to operate openly with the forces of the Entente and the old regime and
had representatives of large landowners and capitalism at its head. The
popular masses would not believe in the pure and disinterested
intentions of the allies; they know very well that when these allies
march against Soviet Russia it is with the intention of making her into
a colony. The reason for the defeat of Denikin, Kolchak, etc.,
consisted, according to Milyukov, above all in that as representatives
of the nobility they disgusted the peasants. The first conclusion that
Milyukov draws from this fact is that the counter-revolutionary
movement in Russia would only be able to win if it came from within and
if it was purged (in appearance at least) of any feudal tendency. But,
based on the events at Kronstadt, Milyukov has made a second
theoretical step: he recognises that for neither the peasants, nor the
workers, nor the soldiers of the Red Army, is the demand for a
Constituent Assembly attractive. The sailors had risen up in the name
of real Soviet power, but at the same time they cried: Down with the
Communists! This "Down with the Communists!" was the reason Milykov
accepted "real Soviet power".</p>

<p>
When the Communist government falls, so will the only force which
supports Soviet Russia in the fight against global capitalism, the only
force capable, at present above all because it has won peace, of
reconstructing normal life, the only force capable, as the most mature
party of the revolutionary peasant and workers, of steering a course
between all the rocks and guaranteeing the achievements of the
Revolution. Soviets without Communists would represent nothing more
than masses of hesitant workers, tired and dispersed; and they would be
obliged to allow freedom of operations to all those bourgeois forces
and organisations which were severely controlled under the government
of Communist Soviets. The counter-revolutionary diaspora would begin to
flow back into Russia, it would flood the organisations of the
partyless Soviets with its own people, and would effectively take
power. And so the moment would have arrived when real power was handed
over to the juridical forms of the counter-revolution, when it judged
this necessary. Milyukov's organ is even engaged in polemic with a
doctrinaire SR, defending the Soviets not merely as administrative
organs, but as governmental power: "The Soviets are not just
consultative or legislative organs, they are the organs of state power
in its entirety. And it is not the case that they could replace the
Bolshevik state and form the base of a more normal organisation of
provinces without breaking with the population. It goes without saying
that they will be unable to fulfil this role reliably until after their
re-election (8th March 1921). Milyukov, founder and ideological leader
of the liberal Cadet Party, who appeared to be a blind and doctrinaire
supporter of European parliamentarism, has understood that the
destruction of the Communist Party would have been the destruction of
the only force which allows Russia to persist as a major
world-revolutionary force. Soviet Russia without the dictatorship of
the Communists would be prey to the counter-revolution. He thus shows
the annihilation of the Communist Party to be a decisive goal of the
counter-revolution, while saying "Do not repel the masses of peasants
and workers by raising demands for a return to bourgeois state forms.
The form doesn't matter - only the content does."</p>

<p>
In peasant Russia, after the annihilation of the Communist Party, [les
travailleurs des campagnes] the toilers of the countryside would
consolidate their power under the Soviet form as a conservative and
bourgeois force, and the rest would follow on its own.</p>

<h3>
3 - The Lessons of the Kronstadt uprising</h3>

<p>
The tactic of the Russian counter-revolution which aims to break the
power of Soviet Russia and overthrow the Communist Party, which seeks
to lead the petit-bourgeois, semi-proletarian and peasant masses into
struggle against the Communist Party, this plan of the Russian
counter-revolution which is rushing to triumph in the name of a truly
Soviet government and a "third revolution" will not succeed. The
Communist Party is sufficiently supple and prudent, it is sufficiently
in contact with the masses that it can thwart this tactic. In profiting
from external respite [/respite from war] to diminish the size of the
Red Army and reduce the demands upon the peasant, in contenting him at
the same time with the produce of industry and foreign trade, the Party
will re-forge links with the peasant. It will excite the initiative of
the proletarian masses, to improve their material situation and to
bring up to the front, into the Party, the most backward layers. From
the present moment, several weeks after the Congress of the Communist
Party, before all the consequences of its new policy can be seen, we
can already feel a new wind blowing which is animating the popular
masses, we can really feel that the Soviet government has ruined the
counter-revolutionary plan to return on the back of the
petite-bourgeoisie. But the fact that the Russian counter-revolution,
in its struggle for power, has managed to use the demand for Soviets,
Soviets under which it was earlier crushed, against the Communist
Party, that is a fact of universal historic significance.</p>

<p>
It is an expression of the revolutionary instinct of the Western
proletariat that, in solidarity with Soviet Russia, which is seen to be
the centre of the world revolution, it cried, "My country, right or
wrong!", without allowing itself to be influenced by any idle gossip
about the Communist Party's "terrorism", or its "opportunism". It has
understood that the question was not to what degree communism could be
realised in Russia - because communism cannot be established either
promptly or in isolation in an agrarian country - but that the only
important thing is that Russia was taken out of the hands of the
counter-revolution, and that 100 million peasants and the economic
forces of the largest country in Europe can no longer be used to
economically or militarily support capitalism as it fights for its
life, but on the contrary, they are being put to use in supporting the
world proletariat fighting for a new social order. The global
proletariat has thus understood, [s'il en etait ainsi, le Parti
Communiste aura toujours raison s'il conserve le pouvoir entre ses
mains] that insofar as this is the case, the Communist Party will
always be in the right so long as it retains power. All of its acts
must be judged from this point of view, including when, in order to win
out against the counter-revolution's military assaults, the Party
implacably rallies all of the resources of the country, including
making certain concessions to petit-bourgeois elements, in order to
break them from landlords and capitalists, agents of
counter-revolution. The advanced sections of the proletariat, with
their revolutionary instinct, have understood all this and they can now
see how right those were who said "it is impossible to simultaneously
support the Russian Revolution and fight the Communist Party". What
Hilferding, Dittmann, Longuet, Bauer, have tried to do, i.e. to adopt
one attitude towards the Communist Party and a different one towards
the Russian Revolution - this in the context of the tactic adopted by
the Russian counter-revolution during the Kronstadt events - appears
like a deception, or, seen in the most favourable light, a
self-deception. "Long live the Russian Revolution! Long live Soviet
Russia! Down with the Russian Communists! Down with the dictators of
Moscow!", cried Hilferding and Bauer, Longuet and Grimm. "Down with the
dictators of Moscow!", replied the Tsarist finance minister Kokovsev,
Milyukov the hero of the Dardanelles, the Paris stock exchange and
General Wrangel. And they add: "Once the Russian Communist Party is
beaten, the counter-revolution will, for a while at least, be able to
dress itself up in the clothing of the Soviets". It's not the clothing
that counts, but the person who wears it, and "Paris is worth a mass"
[i.e. one should be prepared to cynically take part in a ritual in
order to benefit politically]. The Hilferdings and Dittmanns, the
Adlers, the Bauers, the Longuets and all these heroes of the
two-and-a-half international appear here not as the right wing of the
workers' revolution, but as the left wing of the global capitalist
counter-revolution. The future historian of this great struggle to free
the global proletariat will not omit to underline this fact, that when
the Russian Communists filled with their bodies the breach made in the
walls of Petrograd by the Kronstadt sailors, Freiheit wrote "Zinoviev,
the corrupter of the Russian proletariat"; that Longuet and Bauer
expressed their sympathies not with the Communists who were making a
new rampart around Petrograd with their bodies on the ice of the Gulf
of Finland - but with the unthinking tools of the world
counter-revolution at Kronstadt.</p>

<p>
The events of Kronstadt obliged the Western proletariat to draw other
conclusions as well. They drew to a conclusion our discussions with
that section of Communists who wished to oppose the Russian
dictatorship, the dictatorship of the Communist Party, and the idea of
the proletarian dictatorship altogether. The Laufenbergs and the
Wolfheims who thought in 1919 that they could counterpose the
dictatorship of the masses to the dictatorship of the Communist Party
have explicitly passed over into the camp of counter-revolution. In
their last brochure, Moscow and the German Revolution, they openly
declare themselves to be enemies not only of the Communist Party but of
Soviet Russia, denouncing the Soviet government before the German
working masses, as a bad new version of Tsarism. The Ruhles and company
have taken their hatred of the idea of a revolutionary party so far as
to ally with Dittmann and Cie to fight against the so-called
'despotism' of the Russian Communist Party. They have even been
denounced by the German Communist elements who had previously been
morally in agreement with them, as counter-revolutionaries. But this
evolution could only be led to a full conclusion if the Communist
International, in all of its sections, could grasp the universally
valid lessons of Kronstadt and of the new tactic of the Russian
counter-revolution. </p>

<p>
That which is specifically Russian in these events is that, firstly,
the proletarian layer is much thinner in Russia than in the West;
secondly, the petit-bourgeois layers are much more powerful in Russia
than in England or Germany, and consequently their influence on the
working class is stronger than it would be elsewhere, and for this
reason, the petit-bourgeois oscillations of the working class are much
greater in Russia than in Europe. In the West, the struggle will be
more difficult because the bourgeoisie is better organised than in
Russia. Logistical difficulties will be ten times greater than in
Russia, and there will arise situations where large masses of workers
hesitate, and even consider capitulating before the bourgeoisie, or
where the dictatorship of the proletariat will only be able to be
sustained as the steel-hard dictatorship of its Communist vanguard.
For, as with the declaration of the centrists that they are for the
proletarian dictatorship but against terrorism, which simply shows that
these elements are not prepared to use all possible methods of struggle
for the victory of the working masses and that they are ready to flee
or betray; so in all difficult situations the cry of "For the
dictatorship of the entire working class, against the dictatorship of
the Communist Party!" is an indication that these elements are not
ready to fight until even the most backward layers of the working class
are already joining battle, i.e. when the struggle is already easy,
when it is not necessary to spill blood or suffer hunger and cold. In
our brochure, Dictatorship of the Working Class and the Dictatorship of
the Communist Party, oublished in the summer of 1919, in response to
Laufenberg and Wolfheim, we wrote, </p>

<p>
"The Communist Party will not renounce, after the conquest of power,
its combat organs. It will strictly concentrate its members, the best
representatives of the dictatorship; it will always consult them on the
question of which measures the organs of power must take. The Communist
Party will always march at the head of the masses and their
organisations in order to guarantee the dictatorship. For the
dictatorship of the proletariat will not be conquered once and for all:
until the definitive victory, it will have to be conquered and
reconquered every day. The working mass, today divided into layers of
unequal ability to struggle, must be animated with the firm intention
of fighting, in the course of the progress of the revolution, to make
the dictatorship possible. But this combative spirit is very relative
in its generality. Certain parts of the proletariat will always have,
during the organisation of the proletarian dictatorship, a hostile or
indifferent attitude. And the mass, which will celebrate on the day of
victory, may well hesitate in the days of great difficulties, defeats,
and it may even despair of victory and long to capitulate. The
proletarian revolution does not bring with it an immediate relief of
poverty, and in certain circumstances, it may even temporarily worsen
the situation of the proletariat. The adversaries of the proletarian
will take advantage of this opportunity to demand the government of the
workers themselves; it is for this reason that it will be necessary to
have a centralised Communist Party, powerful, armed with the means of
the proletarian government and determined to conserve power for a
certain time, even only as the Party of the revolutionary minority,
while waiting for the conditions of the struggle to improve and for the
morale of the masses to rise.</p>

<p>
"Naturally, if the majority of the working class is taken in by
illusions that it would be better off even in the chains of capitalist
slavery than in fighting for its freedom, and if this majority becomes
active in a difficult situation, in fighting against the dictatorship
of the proletariat which the Communist Party is upholding, then the
latter will be incapable of retaining its position. But for as long as
the an improvement in the situation can be hoped for, the Party must
steadfastly defend its position. When conditions improve, the working
class will once again back the Communist Party and it will be able to
fight on and achieve its decisive victory. The liberation of the
working class can only be won by the workers themselves, by the
fighting majority of the working class; but, in its struggle for
liberation, there can arise situations where the revolutionary minority
of the working class must shoulder the full weight of the struggle and
where the dictatorship of the proletariat can only be maintained,
provisionally at least, as the dictatorship of the Communist Party. And
this situation has arisen more than once in Russia."</p>

<p>
We are convinced that in the light of the events at Kronstadt, the
Communist elements which have so far not understood the role of the
Party during the revolution, will at last learn the true value of these
explanations, as well as the resolution of the 2nd Congress of the
Communist International on the subject of the role of the Party. We
will not draw the full benefit of this lesson - that the Party of the
proletariat has been able to preserve power in its hands in the face of
a petit-bourgeois counter-revolutionary uprising, even when that
uprising bases itself on working-class discontent - if it is only
understood in Russia. It must be realised that, if the Communist Party
can only triumph when it has the support of the mass of workers, there
will nevertheless arise situations in the West where it will have to,
for a certain period, keep power using solely the forces of the
vanguard.</p>

<p>
It must be understood at all times that the Communist Party is the soul
of the revolution and the keystone of the dictatorship of the
proletariat.</p>

<p>
The struggle which the Communist Party of Russia is currently fighting
to strengthen its influence over the working masses who are not yet
communists, for the awakening of initiative in these masses, is the
complement of its firm decision to retain power by all possible means.
And this decision must serve as an example to Communists in all other
countries. That is the greatest lesson of the Kronstadt events, the
international lesson.</p>
