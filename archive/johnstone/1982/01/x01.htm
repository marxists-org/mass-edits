<p class="fst">The declaration of martial law in Poland on December 13 dashed the hopes for a historic compromise discussed in this issue in the article on Poland, which went to press on December 1. The analysis of Poland&#8217;s political and economic crisis made in it still retains its validity. The authoritarian scenario outlined there has now come about with power passing into the hands of a Military Council. With the introduction of draconian penalties for strikers, the suppression of trade union rights and activities, and the imprisonment without charge of a considerable number of Solidarity leaders, the process of democratisation initiated by the workers&#8217; struggles of August 1980 has been rolled back.</p>

<p>The escalation of social tensions immediately preceding this was ushered in by the decision of the PUWP leadership to introduce emergency legislation including a temporary ban on strikes. Faced with the loss of gains granted in the Gdansk Agreement, the Solidarity leadership responded with a policy of confrontation, threatening to organise a national stoppage and a national referendum about establishing a provisional government.</p>

<p>Poland, tragically, has now entered a new and dangerous stage of military rule, the consenquences of which will become clearer in the following days and weeks, and which will require analysis in a subsequent issue of <em>Marxism Today</em>.</p>
