<p class="fst">Messrs. Capitalists have looked the American working class, 1946
edition, in the eye. What they have seen they have not liked. They
have not liked it at all, and now they are beating a retreat,
particularly on the ideological front:</p>

<p class="fst"><em>When the strikes began, the journalists of the capitalist press
made no bones about the fact that these were no ordinary strikes. The
most expansive was Mr. Louis Stark of <strong>The New York Times</strong>. In a
Sunday issue of the paper he said that the strikes were not strikes
merely for wages, but for &ldquo;universality.&rdquo; It is a long
word, but a good one. It is a philosophical term which we can roughly
translate as follows: The worker does not want merely to be a worker
who goes to the factory, produces profits, goes home to sleep, goes
back to the factory, produces profits and so on, indefinitely. He
wants to live a truly rounded life, to take advantage of the
innumerable opportunities for educated, cultured living which are
afforded by the vast discoveries and products of modern capitalism.
The worker enslaved to capital lives a poor, narrow, limited life.
For him to aim at universality (in the words of Mr. Stark) means to
aim at a full, broad, complete existence, what Karl Marx called the
existence of a truly social being. In seeing that the worker was
asking for more than a mere 30% Mr. Stark in our opinion showed great
perception.</em></p>

<p>Victor Riesel of <strong>The New York Post</strong> spent column after
column day after day proving that the workers had all sorts of
extreme social and political ideas which were imperfectly concealed
behind the demand for increased wages.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Mr. Luce Sees a Point</h4>

<p class="fst">Perhaps the most distinctive contribution to this analysis was
made by the press of Mr. Henry Luce, millionaire owner of <strong>Life</strong>
and <strong>Time</strong> and <strong>Fortune</strong>, friend of Chiang Kai Shek and his
semi-fascist regime, agitator for America to become the dominant
imperialism of the 20th century, and husband of Congresswoman Luce,
that enemy of the working class. In his publication, <strong>Time</strong>,
December 3, 1945, Luce&rsquo;s journalists wrote as follows of the
GM-UAW strike:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;It was not a strike for union recognition; it was
not a strike of desperation. It was not a strike against outrageous
working conditions or starvation pay; no one was starving.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;It was a new kind of strike ... what made it new
was that Walter Reuther has based his arguments on the sweeping
effect an increase in pay in the vast motor industry would have on
the economy of the country ...&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">But it was not only in the demand of Reuther that Luce saw the
unprecedented quality of these strikes. In his other publication,
<strong>Life</strong>, of November 26, 1945, he had already given some
indication of what the workers thought:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Neither selfishness nor strikes are anything new
under the American sun. Yet it is hard to resist a feeling that there
is something new about the current flavor of many familiar American
phenomena. It is as though man&rsquo;s motives had changed or clouded
while their acts and words followed the same old pattern from habit.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">In our opinion an absolutely wonderful analysis. Men are repeating
the old phrases, but they mean different things in the advanced
social relations of American society. Luce&rsquo;s editorial sounds
almost like Marxism. Nor are we stretching a point. Listen to this:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Labor does not seem so genuinely interested in
wages, nor management in profits, as both do in something undefined.
Power, perhaps ...&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Elsewhere in his publication, Mr. Luce says the same thing, but
does not hesitate to add, as he does in this editorial, that the way
to bring America out of the crisis is to work hard. &ldquo;The zeal,
sweat and collaboration of a lot of individuals ...&rdquo; The
workers of course will provide the sweat and collaboration on the
assembly line and the capitalists will show the zeal in raking in the
profits.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A Threatening Situation</h4>

<p class="fst">No less than President Truman analyzed the conflict as a conflict
for power. But it was left for General Motors to go to the American
public with their case. The UAW, they said, means socialism. It is
the end of the American way of life as we have known it. They
implied, if they did not say, that if it had been a question of wages
alone, they would have been more sympathetic. But they felt that
their vital privileges as masters of the American economy were
threatened. They complained bitterly to the union leaders and to the
general public that the union papers continually vilified them. They
resented being called fascist-minded, monopolistic cliques, enemies
of democracy, and other unpleasant terms by which class-conscious
workers usually express their detestation of capitalist society.</p>

<p>But after the UAW strike was well on the way and the capitalist
journalists had expressed themselves thus freely, the situation began
to assume more threatening proportions. Truck drivers, meat packers,
steel workers, electrical workers, telephone operators, oil workers &ndash;
Messrs. Capitalists realized that the great masses of workers in the
nation had similar ideas to the UAW workers.</p>

<p><em>Now imagine if two or three million workers were made to
understand by the capitalist press that they were striking for
universality, that it was, a question of power, that they wished to
change the American way of life, etc. If even the workers thought so,
it was not the business of capitalism to encourage them in these
subversive notions and to set them thinking in concrete, precise
terms about matters that they would feel more as an instinct or an
aspiration than as a set program.</em></p>

<p>Somebody may have sounded the alarm. Or, on the other hand, the
capitalistic instinct of keeping the workers dumb may have reasserted
itself. That is as it may be. At any rate during the last week or two
a noticeable change has come over the press.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Sing a Different Tune</h4>

<p class="fst">Victor Riesel now writes a bookkeeper&rsquo;s column. It is all a
question of wages. Workers are interested in nothing more than
dollars and cents. C.F. Hughes of the <strong>New York Times</strong>, giving
<em>The Merchant&rsquo;s Point of View</em>, proves that it is a mere
question of wages and prices. Some months ago this same Hughes was
writing bitter sentences about the extremists on the side of capital
and the extremists on the side of labor who were itching to have a
showdown as to the future of American society.</p>

<p>But, best of all, is our friend, Mr. Luce. <strong>Life</strong> magazine of
February 4 heads its editorial:</p>

<p class="quotecent"><strong>Mr. Fairless Should Pay 18&frac12;&cent;</strong></p>

<p class="fst">Note the first three words in the subhead:</p>

<p class="quotecent"><em>Right or Wrong, the President Picked It and We Have
Got to Get On with the Job</em></p>

<p class="fst">&ldquo;Mr. Fairless has a case, but
it is not good enough.&rdquo; Thus says Mr. Luce in his editorial.
But, as for labor, &ldquo;labor must work hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luce declares that &ldquo;right or wrong&rdquo; Fairless must pay
up. Luce actually writes that when Fairless says that he can pay 15&cent;
but not 18&frac12;&cent;, it &ldquo;smells fishy.&rdquo; That is a
capitalist way of saying that it stinks. Fairless himself beat a
public retreat in asking the President to save his face by calling a
conference. The <strong>Daily News</strong>, every page of which smells of
fascism, denounced Fairless openly, told him that he could not
continue to buck public opinion, in this way, and even predicted that
if he continued to be obstinate he would lose his job.</p>

<p><em>What has happened? Merely this: The determination, the
confidence, the refusal to be scared which labor has shown, have made
all these gentlemen realize that they had better bring this business
to a close as quickly as possible and above all play down labor&rsquo;s
desire for universality, and power, and all the other indefinable
demands. Philip Murray, who had begun by throwing some fierce words
at Truman, showed soon that he at any rate had no sympathy with
universality. He let everybody know that as far as he was concerned,
he wanted a little money for the workers, and that was all. He
denounced sympathy strikes.</em></p>

<p>The capitalists are bringing pressure to bear on Truman to raise
prices, that is to say, to take away with the right hand what they
give to the workers with the left. But one thing is certain. They
have all had a glimpse that, to put it very mildly, by an increase in
wages, labor means far more than the difference between 15&cent; and 18&frac12;&cent;.
They have looked the post-war American worker in the eye, and they do
not like what they see.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Larger Question Posed</h4>

<p class="fst">Labor should ponder well over this development. The capitalists
have shouted socialism, universality, struggle for power &ndash; <em>and
they have frightened nobody</em>. An aspect of great importance is
that large numbers of the middle classes have stood firmly by labor.
History has shown us that when the two fundamental classes,
capitalists and workers, meet in head-on collision, the intermediate
classes are, by and large, ready to go with labor just so long as
labor shows clearly that it means business and is not afraid.</p>

<p><em>We are now seeing the first round of the post-war social
crisis. The later stages will pose question even more fundamentally.
As Philip Murray said before the war was ended: These years are &ldquo;the
years of decision.&rdquo; They are. They will decide whether the
United States will be socialist or fascist.</em></p>

<p>That decision will depend to a large degree on who can win the
middle classes, capital or labor. And labor will win them, not by
hesitation, vacillation or retreat, but by saying boldly:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Yes, people of the United States, we mean
socialism. We mean to control production for the interests of the
whole nation and not for the interests of the fascistic, monopolistic
cliques. We mean universality. We mean everything the capitalists say
and more. For we are convinced that only by the abolition of this
system will we be able to have a genuine democracy and a truly social
existence for the vast majority of the American people.&rdquo;</p>
