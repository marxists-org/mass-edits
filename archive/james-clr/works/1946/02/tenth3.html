<p class="fst">Negro veterans in Alabama have made an organized
demand for their voting rights. They marched through the streets of
Birmingham and to the Jefferson County Court House for registration.
They presented their discharge papers. Whereupon the three-man board
asked them questions like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the Constitution made of?<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Can you repeat the Constitution?<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>How does the government of the U.S. operate?<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>How many departments are there in the U.S.
government?</li>
</ul>

<p class="fst"><em>The majority of the veterans were rejected as
being unfit to exercise their vote, because they were unable to
answer these and similar questions.</em></p>

<p>The demonstration is one of a series being organized
by the Southern Negro Youth Congress. It was headed by a chaplain,
Captain H.C. Tesser, a U.S. Army chaplain wearing his uniform. He was
arrested and told not to use the army uniform for any political
purposes. He replied diplomatically that the aim of the movement was
to increase the number of registered voters and to stimulate the
interests of the Negro veterans in government. He was released.</p>

<p>The veterans have given notice that they intend to
file suit in support of their claims.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Bilbo&rsquo;s Voting Base</h4>

<p class="fst">It is by procedure of this kind that Senator Bilbo
and other members of the Democratic Patty are able to get themselves
elected to Congress year after year; to filibuster against the fights
of the Negro people, and oppose all progressive labor legislation.
Where maneuvers of this kind are not sufficient to keep away the
Negroes the Southerners use threats and, if necessary, violence. For
the most part, however, in the smaller towns and counties in
particular, the Negroes keep away from the registration boards and
the polling booths. They know that they have to live with their
oppressors for 364 days in the year besides voting day. To insist on
voting on Monday could easily mean arrest on Wednesday on some flimsy
charge for which conviction and a heavy sentence would automatically
follow.</p>

<p>Even this prostitution of the law is not necessary. A
Negro who wishes to exercise the revolutionary privilege of casting
the vote and insists upon registration can be told to get out of
town. And if he is &ldquo;wise,&rdquo; he packs up his wife,
children, and baggage and gets out as fast as he can. The veterans of
Birmingham may win their suit in the courts. That will not mean
anything but some more publicity for the Negro cause. Congress and
the courts are always giving the Negro rights in theory which he does
not dare exercise in practice. At a certain stage, the passing of
such legislation becomes a mockery of the Negro people.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Negro Soldiers</h4>

<p class="fst">Yet this demonstration and the similar ones that are
planned hold immense possibilities. Never before have Negroes been so
organized as the U.S. government organized them in the army. Negroes
from all over the U.S. have been segregated in Jim Crow regiments.
Their degraded status has been concretized to themselves on a
national scale hitherto unknown. It has been demonstrated to some ten
million white fellow citizens who were brought face to face by law
and order with this most brutal manifestation of the Negro&rsquo;s
official position in American life. The degradation of the Negroes
has been carried to every quarter of the globe, civilized and
uncivilized.</p>

<p>The Negro soldier has seen himself as he is. To this
has been added the bitterness that the whole world now knows him as
an outcast and a pariah in his own country. The Negroes have
responded by fighting some of their bitterest battles not against the
enemy abroad, but against the enemy at home. Their concentration in
regiments and divisions, the common consciousness of strength in
unity, the sense of common humiliation, en</p>

<p>abled them to demonstrate their resentment wherever
Negro troops were stationed. The story of their battle for their
rights and their self-respect, particularly against the American
troops, will certainly, be told and soon. But with discharge from the
army they have lost the sense of cohesive action.</p>

<p>In many areas of the South, however, they have been
getting together as veterans, determined to fight with the vigor and
the coordination that they have learned in the army.</p>

<p><em>It is too early to speak with any precision of
these Negro veterans in the. South. One thing, however, seems
certain. In the year of the great strikes and the mass upsurge of
labor, the Negro veteran in the South is ready to go the limit in
defense of his rights as a citizen. Over and over again during the
last five years this common thought has emerged from all discussions
on the. Negro question:</em></p>

<table width="50%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="c">THE COLORED BOYS, WHEN THEY GO BACK TO THE SOUTH,
WILL NOT STAND FOR IT ANY LONGER.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">The white Southerners themselves are aware of this.
Rumors, and not all of them wild, have come from the South showing
that the upholders of white supremacy ar e aware of the challenge and
are preparing to meet it. Filibusters in Congress will not diminish,
but will accentuate the tension.</p>

<p>Among these Negroes are some of the forces for the
socialist revolution in the United States. For the moment their
consciousness may be circumscribed within the limits of their own
special problem, but they are men who have seen the world and have
been trained and disciplined in a hard school. With flexibility and
understanding the revolutionary movement will not find it difficult
to share the trials which await them and bring them to the knowledge
that nothing but the overthrow of bourgeois society will give them
their democratic rights.</p>
