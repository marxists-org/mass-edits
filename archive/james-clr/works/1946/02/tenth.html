<p class="fst">The great strikes have shaken the thinking of the whole country
and certainly the thinking of the Negro masses.</p>

<p>This can be seen in the new tone of the Negro press. As is usual
with it, the conflict between capital and labor is viewed from the
point of view of Negro interest. Their conclusions, however, go far
beyond wage increases for Negroes.</p>

<p>The following is from an editorial in <strong>The Pittsburgh Courier</strong>
of January 26:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>Negroes are on the picket lines and around the
conference tables, and every news photograph of massed workers shows
a large number of black faces.</em></p>

<p class="quote"><em>The implications of this development are terrific when
viewed from the standpoint of race relations.</em></p>

<p class="quote"><em>It means that the working masses, black and white, are
comrades in a sense that they have never been before, with identical
interests and equal participation and understanding.</em></p>

<p class="quote"><em>Since economic considerations are always basic, it
stands to reason that from the broader social aspect the antagonisms
that have characterized relations between the two groups are bound to
be undermined.</em></p>

<p class="quote"><em>If it can be brought home to all workers, regardless
of color or creed, that their interests are identical, a tremendous
gain has been made which the most extreme anti-Negro propaganda will
be unable to erase.</em></p>

<p class="fst">The method of argument is important. The editorial does not argue
from any theoretical necessity of white and black unity. It is
concerned with bettering the status of Negroes. There is a strike of
national importance and the writer&rsquo;s heart swells with pride to
see Negroes on the picket lines and taking part in conferences at
which great national decisions are being made. Seeing black faces in
photographs of the American masses is of great significance for him.</p>

<p>From such a basis the enthusiastic recognition of white and black
solidarity is completely genuine. We accept it on that basis. We do
not criticize but welcome the editorial&rsquo;s conclusion that this
common action and common publicity are good for race relations.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Only in Labor&rsquo;s Ranks Can Negroes Be Equal</h4>

<p class="fst">But there are deeper implications even on the strictly Negro basis
of the editorial.</p>

<p>Where else in American life have Negroes ever played, or will they
ever play, a role among the ranks and in the leadership, the kind of
role that they are playing today? In the army they are segregated by
the government. Brigadier-General Davis, the highest ranking Negro
officer, is a kind of show-piece. He goes round the world seeing
after the welfare of Negro troops. In the U.S. government Negroes
participate on the higher levels, and not too high either, as
representatives of Negroes.</p>

<p>Ralph Bunche, the solitary Negro in the State Department, is
paraded at international conferences by the U.S. government. &ldquo;See,&rdquo;
they say, &ldquo;we have a Negro to deal with Negro and colonial
problems.&rdquo; Judge Hastie is proposed as Governor of the Virgin
Islands because of their predominantly Negro population. At all
conferences of big business in the U.S., Negroes are conspicuously
absent.</p>

<p><em>It is in organized labor and labor alone that the Negroes can
play a full part either in the ranks or in the leadership. If today
the Negroes do not get full and complete representation in labor
activities, it is because the dominant class in society is the
capitalist class which is anti-Negro. Where labor ruled and the
working class was dominant, Negroes would at last be free and equal.
A working class society would have to transfer to the new social and
political relations that fundamental equality which, rooted in
production, even today drives labor towards equality in race
relations.</em></p>

<p>The <strong>Pittsburgh Courier</strong> likes to see Negroes in photographs
of the masses and at conference tables. So do we. But the only
society where this will be the rule and not the exception is the
society of organized labor &ndash; Socialism. We do not wish merely
to improve race relations. <em>We wish to abolish the whole idea of
race relations and substitute HUMAN RELATIONS.</em> That&rsquo;s what
the <strong>Courier</strong> wants too. Experience and thought, but above all
experience, will convince Negroes that the road to the achievement of
equality in all spheres is the road to labor&rsquo;s power, the road
to Socialism.</p>
