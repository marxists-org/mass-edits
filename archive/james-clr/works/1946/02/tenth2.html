<p class="fst">The struggle for the FEPC bill, like every working class struggle,
has two sides. The first is the pressure that is brought against the
capitalist class and its political agents in Congress. If that
struggle is not successful, it exposes their reactionary character to
the public at large, and clarifies important political issues.</p>

<p>The second aspect of the struggle is the fact that it mobilizes
the masses of the people, sets them in motion, gives them a
consciousness of direct participation in the solution of social
problems and gives them experience in organization. The two aspects
are not separated. To the degree that the enemy is unambiguously
exposed and the terms and conditions of the struggle made clear, the
greater is the mobilization and clarification of the masses.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Whose Is the Blame?</h4>

<p class="fst">That is precisely what is at stake in the present struggles! for
the FEPC bill. The Southern senators and the opponents of the bill in
the House are the main enemy. Of that there is no doubt. The main
fire must be concentrated against them. But the mass struggle, the
petitions, the protests, the demonstrations, mass meetings lose half
their force and add confusion where they should enlighten. That is so
because it is not consistently made clear that the Southern senators
are only the open enemy, while Congress as a whole is a concealed
enemy and carries on only a token resistance.</p>

<p><em>If President Truman and the large body of the Democratic Party
wanted the FEPC bill to get through Congress they could get it
through. They do not do it for the same reason that they do not force
through federal legislation against lynching. To take steps in
Congress to improve the situation of the Negro in the Southern states
means the splitting of the Democratic Party. They arc not prepared to
split the Democratic Party for the benefit of Negroes. In this
respect Truman carries on faithfully ip the tradition set by the late
President Roosevelt. This is what should be made known to the masses
of the Negro people so that they would be able to carry on an
effective struggle for the FEPC insofar as this struggle is directed
against obstructionism in Congress.</em></p>

<p>The Republican Party made a permanent FEPC bill one of the planks
of its platform in the 1944 elections. The Democratic Party passed
the original FEPC bill. There are only two major political parties in
Congress. Isn&rsquo;t it ridiculous to lay all the blame on some
Southern senators for obstructing a bill which is sponsored by the
two parties, which between them control 99.9 per cent of the votes of
the House?</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, the concentration upon the Southern
senators and the Southern Democrats as a whole actually gives
prestige to those fakers (including Senator Chavez). They rake in
publicity as liberals and genuine democrats for carrying on a
struggle which they more than anyone else know will end in the
victory of the Southern reactionaries.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Road to Victory</h4>

<p class="fst">On Saturday, February 9, when a bill was brought in to substitute
an appropriation bill for FEPC, S-101, only twelve people voted
against. There were 71 voting for. <em>And from the beginning every
single member of the Senate knew that this was going to happen.</em></p>

<p><em>What is the way out? It should be obvious after all these years
that the telegrams, meetings, deputations, etc., which have been
tried year after year to change the vote in Congress are not
sufficient. New York State today has a permanent FEPC. Every
intelligent person knows that Dewey supported this bill because of
the great mass demonstration of the Negroes in Harlem in the summer
of 1943. Every intelligent person knows that this mass demonstration
made the labor organizations as well-as the Democratic and Republican
Parties realize that the situation had reached a breaking point and
that something had to be done.</em></p>

<p>Congress must be made to feel that the masses of the Negro people
and organized labor are sick to death of their saying one thing and
meaning something else, which year after year is practiced by the
so-called liberal senators and congressmen. The road to victory is
the road to Washington, taken not by speechifying delegations, but by
the masses of the Negro people themselves as was threatened in the
March on Washington movement. If the mere threat, of such a movement
made Roosevelt rush through the temporary FEPC bill, we can be
certain that the presence of some thousands of Negroes in Washington
will make Truman realize, as Roosevelt was made to realize, that all
this tomfoolery must stop. Thus while the main fire would be
concentrated on the Southern reactionaries, Congress as a whole would
be made to feel that tire masses of the people meant business.
Nothing else will stop this annual bluff which is being played around
the FEPC as it has been played with the federal anti-lynching bill.</p>

<p><em>It is time also for the Negroes to promote the movement to take
the initiative for a Labor Party. At present their energies are
directed to the fruitless task of making the Democratic Party or the
Republican Party keep its promises to the Negroes. Add up the results
over the past years. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if the Negro people
offered their support to organized labor and agitated the labor
organizations to form a new and independent labor political party?
Inside and outside Congress it would mobilize a united attack against
the common enemy of the laboring people in the United States.</em></p>

<p>If half the energy and time and trouble which have been spent
during the last ten years in trying to convince Congressional
politicians had been directed toward organized labor, that fact
alone, in addition to the great perspective that it would have
opened, would have scared the living daylights out of capitalist
politicians. They would have realized that the Negro people could not
be trifled with any longer.</p>
