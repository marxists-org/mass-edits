<p class="fst">Ben Davis, Jr., Negro Councilman and Stalinist faker, has written
a fierce article against the crimes in Freeport, Long Island, and
Columbia, Tennessee. Ben Davis blames capitalism.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;These conditions,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;have
their roots in capitalism which grows fat on suffering, strife,
disunity and low wages, all of which evils become most acute during
conditions of economic stress and crises.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">And then he ends:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;How our country needs socialism!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Stalinist Record</h4>

<p class="fst">Yes, that is perfectly true. The United States and above all
others, the Negroes, need socialism. But who have been the bitterest
enemies of the social revolution and socialism but the Communist
party, the party of Benjamin Davis, Jr.? In this very article of his,
he calls upon the workers to send a stinging protest to &ldquo;the
second Mississippi Compromise, Harry Truman.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>And how did Harry Truman get into the White House? Wasn&rsquo;t
Harry Truman, second in command and chosen heir of Franklin D.
Roosevelt? The capitalism which grows fat on suffering didn't begin
yesterday. It was there growing fat in 1944 when Ben Davis and his
Communist party rooted for Franklin Roosevelt as President of the
United States. This capitalism was there, growing fat on disunity and
low wages when Roosevelt and Stalin signed the Teheran Pact. During
those days Ben Davis, Jr. did not find that our country needed
socialism so terribly.</em></p>

<p>However, the Stalinist Empire finds the United States in the way
of its expansion. Hitler is defeated. Competition for world
domination is now on the order of the day between Russian imperialism
and American imperialism. Behold, Ben Davis rediscovers how our
country, how badly our country needs socialism.</p>

<p><em>The Workers Party and <strong>Labor Action</strong> from the beginning of
their existence to the present day have been, in the vanguard of the
struggle for socialism. We believe that the first condition for the
overthrow of bourgeois society is a clear recognition by the workers
of all trade union bureaucrats, labor fakers and pseudo-socialists as
the agents of capitalism in the working class movement. Of these, Ben
Davis, Jr. is a notorious example. He and his party practice a
calculated manipulation of Negro suffering and Negro militancy in the
interests of Stalinist politics. One of their most potent weapons of
corruption is the <strong>People&rsquo;s Voice</strong> where Doxey Wilkerson,
its general manager, organizes the weekly outpouring of Stalinist
corruption. Closely associated with him is Adam Clayton Powell, a
slick Negro Congressman, who in addition to his maneuvers in
Washington, writes a weekly article in <strong>People&rsquo;s Voice</strong>.
The National Negro Congress, formerly led by Max Yergan, is now under
the leadership of Revels Cayton, a notorious Stalinist from the West
Coast. These Negroes and quite a few others take advantage of their
color to put across the Stalinist line among the Negro people.</em></p>

<p>It is pernicious at all times but when it takes the form of
perverting the struggle for socialism, then above all, it is
necessary for revolutionary socialists to call these people to
account and to expose them.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Workers Are Learning</h4>

<p class="fst">The father of revolutionary socialism is Karl Marx. His greatest
disciple was Lenin. It is inconceivable that Marx or Lenin would have
condoned in any way the brutal robberies of which the Stalinist
Empire is guilty in Eastern Europe and Western Asia. Marx and Lenin
were the enemies of imperialism in any shape or form. It is possible
to support imperialist banditry in Europe and Asia and preach
socialism in the United States only by a brazen hypocrisy.</p>

<p><em>Marx and Lenin spent their lives in educating the working class
to the evils and crimes of capitalism. Never were they found boosting
a Roosevelt and a Truman on one day and then denouncing them as
enemies of the working class on the next. They made mistakes and they
changed their policies but such mistakes neither they nor any sincere
socialist could possibly make. Such &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; are the
result of conscious deception and deliberate political maneuvers in
the interests of an imperialist power.</em></p>

<p>Why is it so necessary, why is it so urgent today that the
doctrine of revolutionary socialism be presented to the working class
without contamination and without corruption. Why is it so necessary
that revolutionary socialists maintain a vigilant exposure of these
enemies of socialism?</p>

<p>It is because the workers of this country, whites and Negroes, are
deeply conscious of the crimes of capitalism. They cannot formulate
in scientific terms the ills to which they are subjected but they
fight against them and little by little they learn.</p>

<p>A few days ago a general strike took place in the important city
of Houston, Texas. The majority of the original strikers were
Negroes. Yet the entire labor movement in Houston rallied to their
support. On the eve of the general strike, a meeting was held by the
South Side Civic Council to support the strikers. In the courthouse
where the meeting was held, Negroes are prohibited. But the white
workers insisted fhat this rule be broken and more than a third of
the audience were Negroes.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dallas Morning News</strong>, which recognized the significance
of this action wrote an editorial entitled: <em>Houston and Karl Marx</em>.
Here is an extract:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;There is a theory that working for a living is a
sort of economic war between the boss and the worker. That is Karl
Marx theory. To Karl Marx, the employer is the natural enemy of the
worker and the worker is the natural enemy of the employer. That
theory can have only one outcome &ndash; war ... Most of the Houston
employees, of course, never gave Karl Marx a thought. But they are
testing out the Marx theory, whether they so intended or not. They
are learning the hard way.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>The <strong>Dallas Morning News</strong> is perfectly right. Millions of
American workers including Negroes are learning the hard way. They
are testing out the Marxist theory whether they consciously intend it
or not. What they need is a clear consistent exposition of the
doctrines of revolutionary socialism. By this means they will be able
to draw to the end their practical experiences and thus in time
mobilize themselves to overthrow this rotten society.</em></p>

<p>But for many years now the Communist Party with its army of white
and Negro bureaucrats descends upon just such groups as these
splendid Houston fighters and corrupt and mislead them with Stalinist
maneuvers represented as Marxism and social revolution.</p>

<p><em>We of the Workers Party warn the Negro workers in particular
not to be caught by these glib facile time-servers. For the working
class to fulfill its destiny and lead the nation in the social
revolution, it must not only be prepared to struggle and sacrifice.
It must be prepared to examine scrupulously the claims of all parties
which present themselves for leadership. Any serious examination of
the past of the Communist Party and Ben Davis will show that
repudiation of them and all that they stand for is one of the first
lessons that the revolutionary workers must learn.</em></p>
