<p class="fst">The American working class is not yet as familiar as the European
working class with the history and traditions of the revolutionary
socialist movement. March 14, anniversary of the death of Karl Marx
and March 18, the anniversary of the Paris Commune will be celebrated
only by a small minority.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>U.S. Workers and Marx&rsquo;s Heritage</h4>

<p class="fst">As the international crisis deepens, the American proletariat will
rapidly increase its interest in the great thinker whose whole work
was based upon the proletariat as the most progressive force in
modern society and the irreconcilable enemy of capitalist barbarism.
As the class struggle sharpens in the U.S. Marxism will come into
its own as a great popular study. The American proletariat will then
learn to celebrate in its own vigorous style the anniversary of those
workers in Paris who in 1871, to use Marx&rsquo;s phrase, stormed the
heavens. They gave to the world for the first time, the &ldquo;political
form at last discovered under which to work out the economic
emancipation of labor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Karl Marx&rsquo;s life was all of a piece. He devoted himself to a
scientific demonstration cf the inevitable decline of capitalist
society. But side by side with this decline there emerged the
socialist proletariat, the class destined to overthrow capitalism,
establish the socialist society and wipe away for good and all the
exploitation of man by man.</p>

<p><em>In Marx there was not the slightest trace of mysticism. He was
a master of English political economy, German philosophy, and French
political science. These he used in his monumental labors to
establish that the social movement had the inevitability, of a
process of natural history, that it was &ldquo;governed by laws not
only independent of human will, consciousness and intelligence, but
rather on the contrary determining that will, consciousness and
intelligence.&rdquo; By this he did not mean to say that the future
of human society was predestined in all its events and occurrences.
He knew that men made their own history. He knew that social life
proceeded by the conflict of interests and passions, complicated by
all the bewildering phenomena which attend the daily activity of
hundreds of millions of human beings. But he, more than any other
thinker, established the fact that all these multitudinous actions
took place according to certain laws. For him the most important law
was the organic movement of the proletariat to overthrow bourgeois
society.</em></p>

<p>Perhaps today it would be as well to recall an aspect of his
doctrine too often forgotten. No man had a more elevated conception
of the destiny of the human race. This for him was the greatest crime
of capitalism, that while on the one hand, it created the possibility
of a truly human existence for all mankind, by the very nature of the
process of capitalist production, it degraded the individual worker
to the level of being merely an appendage to a machine.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A New Vision for the Working People</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>In his great work, <a href="../../../../marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm"><strong>Capital</strong></a>, over and over again, he
pointed out that as capitalist production became more scientific, the
actual labor of the worker was more and more deprived of intellectual
content and educational potentiality. So far was Marx from being a
vulgar materialist that in his denunciation of the evils of
capitalist production, he did not hesitate (for the moment) to brush
aside the wages of the worker. &ldquo;In proportion as capital
accumulates,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;the lot of the laborer, BE
HIS PAYMENT HIGH OR LOW, must grow worse.&rdquo; On the basis of
economic analysis he drew the conclusion that modern society would
perish if it did not replace the worker of today, condemned to
automatic repetition of mechanical movement, by the highly developed
individual. Such a man, according to Marx, would be fit for a variety
of labors, ready to face any change of production, a man to whom the
different social functions he performed were but so many means of
giving free scope to his own natural and acquired powers. This for
him would be a worker in a civilized society but that could come only
by the destruction of capital.</em></p>

<p>Such was his vision that this student of political economy and the
labor process has unfolded perhaps the most poetic and far- seeing
perspective for human society ever propounded by any philosopher or
poet. According to him it was only with the creation of the socialist
society that the real history of humanity would begin. Thus at a
single stroke, he thrust into insignificance the painfully acquired
knowledge and culture of thousands of years of civilization, which
he, more than most other men had studied and understood. All this, he
said, would be as nothing in comparison with the perspective which
would be opened to human society by the abolition of the exploitation
of classes on the basis of a worldwide cooperation.</p>

<p><em>Yet scientist and philosopher as he was, with an unquenchable
faith in the inevitability of socialism, Marx was no mere man of the
study. He took part in the German revolution of 1848, was active in
the preparations of the French revolution of that year, and to the
end of his. days participated, whenever possible, in the workers&rsquo;
struggles against capitalism which he always knew as preparation for
social revolution.</em></p>

<p>In 1871, when the workers of Paris established the Commune, Marx
hailed it as one of the greatest events in human history. Let us
briefly recall the circumstances.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The First Working-Class Government</h4>

<p class="fst">France had been defeated by the armies of Germany which stood at
Versailles, a few miles away from Paris. The leaders of French
capitalism, statesmen and soldiers, were on their knees before the
German conquerors, anxious to save their hides and the plunder that
they had accumulated during the war. They were ready to sell out
France, to the conqueror. The French people had proclaimed the French
republic, and these capitalist politicians knew that one great
obstacle Stood in the way of their conspiracy with Bismarck. This
obstacle was the armed republicans of Paris.</p>

<p>Working in the closest association, with the German invaders, the
French ruling class attempted to disarm the Parisians but the workers
of Paris, emaciated by a five month&rsquo;s famine, did not hesitate
for a single moment. They seized the power in Paris and established
the Paris Commune.</p>

<p>What exactly was this Commune?? There have been many
interpretations. The interpretation of Karl Marx remains unchallenged
in its simplicity and its penetration.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;It was essentially a working class government, the
product of the producing against the appropriating class, the
political form at last discovered under which to work out the
economic emancipation of man.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What the Paris Commune Symbolized</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>The Paris Commune was first and foremost a democracy. The
government was a body elected by universal suffrage. None of its
functionaries was paid more than the wages of a skilled worker. It
did not expropriate the property of the bourgeoisie, but it handed to
associations of workingmen all closed workshops and factories,
whether the capitalist owners had run away or simply had decided to
stop work.</em></p>

<p>It lasted for 71 days. It was destroyed by a combination of its
own weaknesses, chiefly a lack of decision, and the treacheries of
the French bourgeoisie in shameless alliance with the German army.
The murderous brutality with which the fighters of the Commune were
shot, tortured and deported, remained a landmark in European
civilization, until the days of Hitler and Stalin.</p>

<p>Today, to the American proletariat, there are many lessons to be
drawn from the history of the Commune. Perhaps the most important for
the advanced workers are the methods by which Marx approached its
study and the conclusions which he drew. For him, the Commune,
despite its failure, was a symbol of inestimable value.</p>

<p>It was a symbol in that it showed the real women of Paris &ndash; 
heroic, noble and devoted like the women of antiquity. It was a
symbol in that it showed to the world: &ldquo;working, thinking,
fighting, bleeding Paris &ndash; almost forgetful in its incubation
of a new society, of the cannibals at its gates &ndash; radiant in
the enthusiasm of its historical initiative.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>It was a symbol in that it admitted all foreigners to the honor
of dying for the immortal cause.</em></p>

<p><em>It was a symbol because even before peace had been signed with
Germany, the Commune made a German working man the Minister of Labor.</em></p>

<p><em>It was a symbol because under the eyes of the conquering
Prussians on the one hand, and the Bonapartist army on the other, it
pulled down the great Vend&ocirc;me column which stood as a monument
to the martial glory of the first Napoleon. Marx saw in these actions
not accidental gestures but organic responses of the revolutionary
proletariat to the barbarous practices and ideology of bourgeois
society.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Important Conclusion</h4>

<p class="fst">Most important, however, Marx drew a great theoretical conclusion
from the experience of the Commune. He showed that the capitalist
army, the capitalist state, the capitalist bureaucracy, cannot be
seized by the revolutionary proletariat and used for its own
purposes. It had to be smashed completely and a new state organized,
based upon the organization of the working class. In 1871, he drew
this as a theoretical conclusion. In 1905, and later in 1917, the
Russian working class, by the formation of Soviets, or workers
councils, laid the basis of a new type of social organization. It was
by his studies of Marx&rsquo;s analysis of the Commune that Lenin was
able to recognize so quickly the significance of the Soviets and to
establish them as the basis of the new workers&rsquo; state.</p>

<p><em>Today the advanced American worker needs to know the history of
the international struggles of the proletariat. From these he will
most quickly learn to understand his own. Marx&rsquo;s pamphlet on
the Commune, <a href="../../../../marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm"><strong>The Civil War in France</strong></a>, is a profound and moving
piece of writing. The worker who has not yet begun the study of
Marxism will never forget this double anniversary if he celebrates it
by reading what Karl Marx had to say about the great revolution of
the Paris working-class.</em></p>
