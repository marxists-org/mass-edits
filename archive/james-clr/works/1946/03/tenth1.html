<p class="fst"><strong>On February 4, in Freeport, Long Island, a boom town of the war
industries, a policeman killed two Negro boys and wounded a third.
They were brothers and all either at present in the armed forces or
recently discharged. It was cold-blooded, deliberate murder. The
consequence was an explosion of social tension. Immediately after the
shootings, the police found it necessary to throw a cordon around the
Freeport bus terminal, and men with tommy guns and tear gas were
placed at strategic points to &quot;await a possible uprising of
local Negroes.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Today the nation as a whole is further startled by what has taken
place in Columbia, Tenn. A Negro woman and her son, Jimmy Stevenson,
a Navy veteran, resisted slander and attack by a white man. Word
spread in the Negro community (known as Mink Slide) that the whites
were coming to the settlement to get Stevenson. Stevenson took
shelter in the home of neighbors and the rest of the Negro community
mobilized to resist the arrest, which they feared would end in a
lynching. The police came to Mink Slide with pistols blazing.</p>

<p><em>Between 8&nbsp;p.m. Monday, February 25, and 8&nbsp;a.m.
Tuesday, a bloody riot raged in Columbia. Armed Negroes swarmed to
the defense of the Negro district, barricading their stores and
homes. Policemen, National Guardsmen and State Guardsmen not only
raided the homes and businesses of the Negroes, but riddled them with
machine guns. Among the arms used by the Negroes were many which had
been brought back from Europe by discharged Negro veterans. Captured
were six double-barreled shotguns, nine single barreled shotguns, one
German machine gun, several knives and many hundred rounds of
ammunition.</em></p>

<p>When the toll was taken Tuesday morning, there had been ten
persons wounded, four policemen, four white townsmen and two Negroes.
Over 65 persons were arrested, all Negroes. Armed bands of whites
rambled through the town. Five hundred guardsmen patrolled the
streets. While the white administration of Columbia was promising the
Negroes that these guardsmen were for their protection as well as for
that of the whites, two of the Negro prisoners were murdered in the
jail.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What They Signify</h4>

<p class="fst">I want to draw attention here not only to these incidents
themselves but to what they signify. It is clear that such explosions
are evidence of a tremendous underlying social tension revolving
around the race question. Observers in Harlem and in other towns
report that evidences of the feeling which preceded the explosions in
1943 are once more noticeable. This time, however, the presence of
Negro veterans, trained in the use of arms, some of which they have
brought with them, creates the possibility of bloody conflicts on a
scale exceeding those which took place when the soldiers were away
from home.</p>

<p><em>It must not be thought that the incidents and their
repercussions are confined to Freeport or Columbia. Negro communities
all over the country are seething with indignation. The NAACP and
other Negro organizations are as usual protesting mightily but doing
nothing to mobilize the great masses of the Negro people in
demonstrations which can give effective force to the rage which
consumes them.</em></p>

<p>The Workers Party joins in the protests which have arisen from all
party of the country among whites and Negroes alike at these examples
of American capitalist vandalism. For the time being I shall quote
the last paragraph of my column of February 25 which dealt with the
attempts of Negro veterans in Alabama to exercise their voting
rights.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;Among these Negroes are some of the forces for
the socialist revolution in the United States. For the moment their
consciousness may be circumscribed within the limits of their own
special problems, but they are men who have seen the world and have
been trained and disciplined in a hard school. With flexibility and
understanding, the revolutionary movement will not find it difficult
to share the trials which await them and bring them to the knowledge
that nothing but the overthrow of bourgeois society will give them
full democratic rights.&rdquo;</em></p>
