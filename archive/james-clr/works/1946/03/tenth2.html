<p class="fst">The Negroes in Columbia, Tenn., were insulted, shot up, murdered,
arrested, their property destroyed and some of it looted.</p>

<p>Now, however, comes the final injustice. The Negroes are going to
be tried by the same government whose official storm troopers led the
mob in the pogrom.</p>

<p><em>It is alleged, and powerful evidence given, that patrolmen and
members of the state militia had stolen Negro property. In the
business establishment of Julius Blair the clock was shot from the
wall, the juke box was wrecked, the cloth was cut from the billiard
table. But in addition all cigarettes, cigars and ice cream were
missing. Now, during the time that these were lost, all civilians
were barred from the Negro area. Who committed this vandalism and
this theft?</em></p>

<p>Negroes are being charged with having concealed weapons. Yet these
concealed weapons, so called, were taken by the police without any
warrant.</p>

<p>Thirteen of the defendants are held in $5,000 bond on an
attempt-to-commit-murder charge. <em>Thus it is the persecuted Negroes who are
in the dock.</em></p>

<p>On the other hand, nothing was being said by law and order in
Columbia about the wrecking of the Negro community. Nothing is being
said about the two Negroes killed by the police in an alleged jail
break. The Negroes have been attacked but only two white arrests have
been made in the case.</p>

<p><strong>Labor Action</strong> and the Workers Party call upon organized
labor in particular to demonstrate in every way its solidarity with
these persecuted American citizens. Their troubles are not over. The
more unwarranted has been the attack upon them, the more shameless
will be the brutality and ferocity of the Columbia authorities in
constructing a gigantic frameup of their victims.</p>

<p><em>Organized labor, however, must not only act. Organized labor
must take note of the political behavior of the Washington
government.</em></p>

<p>President Truman has a certain procedure, perfected by his
predecessor, President Roosevelt. It works as follows: Organized
labor demands higher wages. Truman, recognizing that labor means
business, declares himself in favor of 19&frac12; cents? But, at the
same time, he grants price increases to capital which nullify the
rising wages.</p>

<p><em>The nation as a whole demands a permanent FEPC bill. Truman
sends a resounding message to Congress in favor of the bill. But his
followers in Congress sit back and allow the Southern senators to
talk the bill out of existence.</em></p>

<p>Now comes the Columbia pogrom. This is a matter for the Attorney
General, Tom Clark. Last week he issued a solemn statement. As you
read it, bear in mind the equally solemn statements issued by Truman
about the necessity of raising labor&rsquo;s wages and of passing an
FEPC bill. This is Clark:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;We have come thus far in the unsettled postwar
period without great disorder. However, symptoms of increasing
intolerance have been noted recently.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;It is my desire that you immediately devote
special attention and investigation to protection of all Americans in
their civil liberties, regardless of their race or color. Special
attention should be paid to laxity or inefficiency of peace officers
of any category.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;I am seeking to determine the causes of potential
disorders no matter how minor they seem. In these days of rapid
transmission of information, an outbreak in one locality might well
inspire similar conditions in another.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Patience Exhausted</h4>

<p class="fst">Attorney General Clark knows the danger in which the Negroes
stand. He puts himself on record as recognizing the explosive
situation in the country today. But he, more than</p>

<p>anyone in the country, knows that his statement is mere talk,
designed for the record and to give the nation and the Negroes the
impression that the Department of Justice will punish these official
persecutors of the Negro people.</p>

<p><em>It is merely the Roosevelt-Truman technique repeated in
relation to the Negroes in Columbia. And if its hypocrisy stands out
with exceptional crudeness in this case, it is because the Negro
people are not sufficiently organized to make their resentment
Sufficiently felt in the offices of government.</em></p>

<p>When faced with the result of Negro resistance to persecution in
Detroit, Roosevelt&rsquo;s Attorney General, Biddle, made the
following proposal: Prevent Negroes from going North. He believed
obviously that in the South the combination of federal and state
terrorism was sufficient to keep them subdued. Having thus
demonstrated his conception of democracy, Biddle is now in Europe
helping to try Nazis for, among other things, persecution of the Jews
and violation of civil liberties!</p>

<p><em>There is no end to the shamelessness, of these two-faced
liberals in regard to the century-old persecution and humiliation of
the Negro people. But, thank goodness, there are signs that there is
a very definite limit to the patience of all persecuted people,
Negroes included.</em></p>
