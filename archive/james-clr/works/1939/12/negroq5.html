<p class="fst">Hoover has already sent $100,000 to the Finnish bourgeoisie. Let
no Negro give one red cent to this counter-revolutionary campaign on
behalf of the enemies of the Finnish workers&rsquo; movement. The
road for the workers is a different road &ndash; the road that should
have been followed in regard to Ethiopia. That road was pointed.
Preparations were made. But the working class and the Ethiopian
leaders made the fatal mistake of putting their trust in
imperialists.</p>

<p>When Italian fascism began its attack on Ethiopia, workers all
over Europe felt great sympathy with Ethiopia.</p>

<p>In 1935, as in 1914 and 1939, the leaders of the big labor
parties, Blum in France, Attlee in Britain, and the leaders of the
trade unions, Jouhaux in France, Sir Walter Citrine and Ernest Bevin
in Britain, Lewis and Green in America, were completely reactionary.
They always support their capitalist government in any really serious
struggle.</p>

<p>But in Britain, France, Belgium, Spain, among the second and third
ranks of the leadership, and especially among the class conscious
workers, there arose a strong feeling for working class action on
behalf of Ethiopia. All the capitalists and the labor fakers were
babbling about League of Nations &ndash; in other words, looking to
the League of Bandits to arrest another bandit for doing what all the
bandits wanted to do themselves. But the rank and file workers, and
the leaders nearest to them, were saying that the seamen, who were
carrying oil to Italy should, supported by the International
Federation of Trade Unions, stop carrying that oil.</p>

<p>If the workers stopped carrying it, both Mussolini and his brother
bandits would be in serious difficulty, for these gentlemen fear
nothing so much as the independent action of the working class.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Why Mussolini Got Oil</h4>

<p class="fst">Eugene Jagot, official of the War Resisters International, a small
political organization, went to the Brussels meeting of the
International Federation of Trade Unions, to urge the trade union
bureaucrats to sanction this international workers&rsquo; boycott.
Naturally, Citrine, Bevin, Jouhaux, did not want any such thing. But
the pressure was strong, the workers were aroused. There was some
possibility of at least a partial success, or even, given certain
circumstances, of a great victory.</p>

<p>What certain circumstances? The Soviet Union had been clamoring
for both action by the League of Nations and independent action of
the workers. Now you cannot do both. Either the workers act by
themselves, or they support some action by the ruling class or by
some section of it. But the Stalinists claimed that they could
support the League of Bandits and at the same time have independent
workers&rsquo; action. If, at this critical moment, when the
Federation of Trade Unions was actually meeting, not the Soviet
Government but the Soviet trade unions had decided on a boycott and
called on all seamen, railwaymen, miners, to refuse to ship any
materials to Italy, then those who were fighting at Brussels to break
the resistance of the European Lewises and Greens would have been
enormously strengthened. What happened was exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>The Stalinist bureaucracy is today and has been for many years the
most dangerous enemy of the workers&rsquo; revolution. Stalin and the
Stalinists had been calling for this independent working class
action. This was for the record. But the moment there was a
possibility of getting the millions of trade unionists moving, they
sacrificed this to their alliance with Britain and France. A hasty
telegram came from Moscow to Brussels, stating that under no
circumstances would the Soviet Union support independent action. They
would support the League of Nations, and the League alone.</p>

<p>With this blow from Moscow, the movement for working class option
was killed.</p>

<p>The masses of the workers, especially in Europe, meant well toward
Ethiopia, but they were misled by the labor fakers, assisted by the
Stalinist bureaucracy.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Try to Save Ethiopia Again</h4>

<p class="fst">There was another attempt made to save Ethiopia by the masses of
the people. As soon as the war broke out, thousands of young men
black and white, volunteered to form an international brigade, to
fight with the Ethiopians against Italian fascism. Mr. G.T. Garratt,
a British official in India and a correspondent of the <strong>Manchester
Guardian</strong>, states in his book <strong>Mussolini Over Spain </strong>that in
the list of names sent into the Ethiopian embassy there were, after
all necessary deductions, five thousand men who could have been
organized into a powerful corps, ready to stiffen Ethiopian
resistance in those early difficult days.</p>

<p>Why did it not materialize? Because the Emperor of Ethiopia and
particularly Mr. Martin, the Ethiopian Minister in London, were tied
up with the British Foreign Office officials those imperialist
bandits, and were looking to them for assistance and not to the
masses of the workers. The result was that this splendid beginning,
which could have been the nucleus of tens of thousands of volunteers
and millions of dollars, was rejected by the Ethiopian Government in
order not to offend the imperialists, those same imperialists who
were plotting its downfall.</p>

<p>So that today when these same rascals start talking about &ldquo;poor
little Finland,&rdquo; or poor little anybody, let every Negro ponder
over the lesson of Ethiopia. Imperialism is on one side. We are on
the other. We look always to ourselves. What was needed, what we need
today, is an international revolutionary organization, which will
agitate in the working class movement for international working class
action for working class aims, &ndash; actions such as Eugene Jagot
proposed. Such an organization as it grows stronger will organize
international brigades, not to carry out the counter-revolutionary
Stalinist policy, as was done in Spain, but to fight for the
socialist revolution and the independence of the colonial countries.
Such today is the Fourth International. Join it.</p>
