<h2>J.R. Johnson</h2>

<h1>The Negro Question</h1>

<h3>(16 December 1939)</h3>

<hr class="infotop" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>, <a href="../../../../../history/etol/newspape/themilitant/socialist-appeal-1939/index.htm#sa03_93" target="new">Vol. III No. 93</a>, 16 December 1939, p.&nbsp;3.<br />

<p class="fst">Periodically one comes across statements in the Negro press, more
often one hears remarks from individual Negroes, which betray with
what facility some Negro politicians slip into racial chauvinism to
cover political bankruptcy. The latest addition to the list is Roy
Wilkins.</p>

<p>Roy Wilkins is the editor of <strong>The Crisis</strong>, writes a weekly
column in the <strong>Amsterdam News</strong>, and is known everywhere as a
&ldquo;progressive&rdquo; person. He, with other Negro
intellectuals, was a great friend of the Stalinists in the days when
they were rooting for &ldquo;F.D.R.,&rdquo; throwing their cloaks in
the mud for Eleanor Roosevelt to walk on, and fraternizing with Negro
bishops and Father Divine as the future leaders of Negro
emancipation. All these rascally tools of Stalin were after was to
get America into war with Hitler, then Stalin&rsquo;s enemy. The
moment Stalin came to terms with Hitler, the Stalinists began to see
that the war against Hitler was not so good after all, that in fact
it was a very bad war &ndash; it was an imperialist war. They opened
fire on F.D.R., Eleanor, Murphy, and all their old friends, and sure
as day they are going to instruct Ford, Patterson, Richard Moore and
the other Negro Browders to pour a special stream of abuse on Walter
White, Roy Wilkins, and the other Negro New Dealers, whom not four
months ago the Stalinists flattered and fawned upon.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Bedfellows Part</h4>

<p class="fst">Now the New Dealers are bitter. Eleanor, in particular, is very
bitter. She says the Stalinists &ldquo;ought to go to Russia.&rdquo;
One day she will, even send a letter to David Lasser of the Workers
Alliance, resigning her honorary membership, unless Dave Lasser first
expels her. All the liberals, once friends of the Stalinists, are now
howling for their blood. And high among them is Roy Wilkins. He
cursed the Hitler-Stalin pact and now, in his column in the <strong>Amsterdam
News</strong> of November 9th, he denounces the invasion of Finland and
the lies of Molotov.</p>

<p>The Fourth International denounces and will continue to denounce
the policies of Moscow, which remain the chief obstacle in the
working class on the road of the world revolution and the
emancipation of the workers. But we are no supporters of Mannerheim
and the Finnish bourgeoisie, who in 1918-1919 massacred Finnish
workers by the thousands. No word of this appears in Wilkins&rsquo;
comment. He is for Mannerheim against Stalin. Wilkins is no
revolutionary and has the same ideas about politics as the
Roosevelts, Attorney-General Murphy, and the whole gang of New
Dealers, white and black.</p>

<p>What, however, is most revealing is the last paragraph of his
column. In it he says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Aside from everything else, this means that the
dark brother in America, who had been hoping for the emergence of
some international leadership sympathetic to his problems, must turn
elsewhere, for the opportunism of the Stalinites is on a par with the
opportunism of the Republican party. Both have tossed the brother
overboard as soon as they got what they wanted from him.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Wilkins Deceives the Negroes</h4>

<p class="fst">This is one of the most mischievous and despicable misstatements
that could be made by a man in Wilkins&rsquo; position. In what way
have the Stalinists, scoundrels though they are, tossed the black
brother overboard when they got what they wanted from him? Stalin and
the bureaucrats exiled Trotsky, a white man, and murdered nearly
every member of his family. They shot Zinoviev, Kamenev, Rykov,
Tomsky, Bucharin, Yagoda, and thousands upon thousands of other
Russians, all white men. As Wilkins knows, they massacred the Spanish
revolutionists, white people all. When they wanted to push America
into war against Hitler, they became New Dealers, they praised the
&ldquo;democracies,&rdquo; they said they would make capitalism work,
they shook hands with Wilkins and presented their foreheads to be
blessed by Father Divine and the behinds to be kicked by Walter
White.</p>

<p>Now that they want to keep America from going to war with Hitler,
they abuse Roosevelt, they curse the New Deal, they condemn
capitalism, they use phrases about socialism, and they open up a big
drive in Harlem to recapture the natural militancy of the Negroes.
All this is part of the Stalinist policy.</p>

<p>But how can Wilkins say that they have specifically used the black
man and now want to drop him when they have no more use for him?
Wilkins has committed a great crime against the Negro people.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Why Wilkins Raises the Race Issue</h4>

<p class="fst">Today, in the world crisis we face, we need unity in the working
class, particularly between black and white. The workers may differ
among themselves, this one Stalinist, the other one Socialist,
another Trotskyite, etc. But against the capitalist class and their
capitalist war we must be united. We of the Fourth International know
the Stalinists for the treacherous corruption that they are. We point
out their political crimes, the political reasons for them, and we
ask the workers to break with them.</p>

<p>But Wilkins, who ought to know better, says to the Negroes, &ldquo;It
is merely some more whites fooling the Negroes again.&rdquo; While
some Detroit Negroes printed leaflets and distributed them to the
Negro workers telling them not to scab on the white workers, thereby
building up class solidarity, Wilkins goes out of his way to make the
Stalinist crimes a race question and thus accentuate racial
differences.</p>

<p>Every Negro worker, with three hundred years of oppression behind
him, is naturally inclined to see race prejudice in every political
move. That is understandable. We must explain, Wilkins deliberately
confuses. And why? Because he is not a Marxist; he is not a
revolutionary. He is bourgeois to the bone. He, like so many others,
wanted to be imperialist with Roosevelt and play at being
revolutionary with the Stalinists. But the Stalinists have only one
god &ndash; Stalin. They get their orders and they leave all the New
Dealers naked. Wilkins has nothing to fall back on. But he knows one
cry which will always catch the ears of Negroes &ndash; &ldquo;Race.
They do it because we are black.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>In reality the racial traitor is not the Stalinist, who twists his
policy for reactionary political reasons, but Wilkins himself. Yes,
Wilkins himself, who uses the race issue to cover up his political
bankruptcy.</p>
