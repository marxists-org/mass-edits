<p class="fst">For once the publisher&#8217;s blurb is no exaggeration: &#8216;CLR James
is one of the twentieth century&#8217;s most remarkable individuals.&#8217;
Nobody could argue with that. Born in 1901, James was a leading
literary figure in his native Trinidad well before he came to
Britain. From Nelson, Lancashire, he became cricket correspondent for
the <strong>Manchester Guardian</strong> and other papers. In 1938 he published
<strong>The Black Jacobins: Toussaint L&#8217;Ouverture and the San Domingo
Revolution</strong>, a landmark study of slave revolt. He has written
extensively on politics, dialectics, literature and sport. <strong>Beyond
a Boundary</strong>, his remarkable study of what cricket meant to him,
and should mean to us, came out in 1963.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Sensitive portrait</h4>

<p class="fst">He lectured for years in the USA and in Africa, and acted as
<em>eminence grise</em> to such leaders of Pan-Africanism as Ghana&#8217;s
Kwame Nkrumah. He was also a relentless political activist, a leading
figure in British Trotskyism in the Thirties in the Marxist Group and
the Independent Labour Party; and in the Forties, a leading figure in
and out of the American Trotskyist organisation, the Socialist
Workers Party. In the Sixties he entered the fray in Trinidad with
his Workers and Farmers Party.</p>

<p>Paul Buhle&#8217;s book <strong>CLR James: The Artist as Revolutionary</strong>
is an intellectual, political and cultural biography, a sensitive
portrait by a man who has been an editorial collaborator with James
for years. Himself an historian of American Marxism and former
activist of the New Left, as well as cultural critic, Buhle is
steeped in many of the concerns and the personalities close to his
subject&#8217;s heart. If he sometimes makes inflated claims for his
hero, it is not simply out of affection for the man and regard for
his achievements. Buhle sees James as the nearest thing yet to an
ideal reconciliation of the multiple identities of a sundered human
nature, which is the fragmented condition of every man and woman in
late capitalist society. It is an almost mystical theme, seeking
redemption within the individual personality for problems which are
social in nature and origin. It is consistent with the over-emphasis
on ideology and the anti-Leninist bent of Buhle&#8217;s earlier work.
Nevertheless, the story of James&#8217; life, and the detail and the
connections which Buhle brings to bear from his own wide learning,
make this a book worth reading.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Holding: how fast?</h4>

<p class="fst">CLR James, not far from 90, is now ensconced in a second-floor
garret in Brixton. Perched above the offices of <strong>Race Today</strong>,
with a view down Railton Road, he sits in an armchair flanked by
shelves of books (a cricket ball is wedged among them). He gets the
first question in: &#8216;Are you Irish? I thought you might have some
whiskey in your pocket. No whiskey? Irish in name only.&#8217;</p>

<p>He is frail, but he talked for over an hour before tiring. Lucid
and serious, but with a spry wit, he often checked after a long
answer, &#8216;Is that clear? Good&#8217;. He was quick to rebuke any hint of
a lazy or patronising question, and careful in all his replies. When
towards the end I asked if he had ever seen anybody bowl as fast and
straight as Michael Holding, he weighed the question up: &#8216;I
couldn&#8217;t compare the pace of bowlers. I have known bowlers who were
as fast as anything when they were playing. I will say this much.
Holding ranks with the greatest fast bowlers there have ever been.
I&#8217;m not going to compare him with George John or Statham, but he&#8217;s
in that rank. There is no perhaps or maybe about it. He is one of the
great fast bowlers. You want to know more, ask the great batsmen of
the day.&#8217;</p>

<p>What did he think of the biography? &#8216;I thought it was a very
good book, and a hard book to write, a biography. I haven&#8217;t killed
anybody, but he made it interesting. A successful piece of work.&#8217;
The political climate in which the book has been published is very
different from the times that it describes, when James rubbed
shoulders with Leon Trotsky, and baulked at the latter&#8217;s advice to
enter the Labour Party in the Thirties. How would he compare
political work in Britain then and now? &#8216;In those days independent
revolutionary work was quite an adventure. Today things are more
organised. It&#8217;s harder in a way, but you know what you&#8217;re doing.
In the Thirties the whole thing was wide open. You were in an open
sea, and you worked hard or you sank. Today, it isn&#8217;t so. The
organisations are pretty much set and now you join this or you join that.&#8217;</p>

<p>He had been in many organisations, and often in none: did he still
believe in the importance of a revolutionary party? &#8216;I believe you
must have an organisation, but I don&#8217;t believe that means you have
to join something that&#8217;s there. Maybe you have to fight against an
organisation to get a clear policy. In the old days an organisation
meant a certain political and philosophical orientation. Today it is
that in theory, but in reality it is a structure. In the old days the
political line and the philosophical basis of it was dominant, not
today.&#8217; So he hadn&#8217;t moved away from Leninism? &#8216;No, I have
always felt that I was a Leninist. I believe Lenin was the greatest
political leader, theoretician and organiser that we have known.&#8217;</p>

<p>James took great pains to distinguish Leninism from Trotskyism.
&#8216;Trotskyism and Leninism are not the same. Leninism &#8211; you are for
the Leninist revolution; Trotskyism &#8211; you are for the Trotskyist
party. Lenin had a philosophical view of the revolution. He was not
on the surface. He was fundamentally opposed to bourgeois society and
unless you are aware that every step that he took had that in mind
you will go wrong with Lenin. Trotsky began to be for the party,
quoting Lenin for the party, but in reality his conception of the
party was different. Trotsky in the end was swept away by his
followers into having, I wouldn&#8217;t say a superficial, but a
conception of the party that was not fundamentally connected with the
state of society. Lenin never lost sight of the party and its
relation to the people.&#8217;</p>

<p>How would Lenin have dealt with Margaret Thatcher? &#8216;Lenin would
have said, &#8220;She has won three times. Something happens once, that
is an accident. The second time, maybe it is a coincidence. But the
third time, that is an orientation. She has won three times, let me
see why.&#8221; He wouldn&#8217;t rush into agitation to put up somebody
against her. He would have said, &#8220;Bring me all her books and
everything she has said&#8221;. He would have analysed them all and he
would have said &#8220;She represents this and this today is stronger
than it was, and she sticks to that, and that is why she wins; and
now to defeat her we have to get down to these fundamentals&#8221;.&#8217;</p>

<p>James is a mine of rare first-hand reflections, not just on
international revolutionaries but on the people who made the history
of the British left &#8211; men like Red Clydeside MP James Maxton of the
ILP. &#8216;Maxton was an orator. He had a fine voice and a rhetorical
manner, and he said all the things that everybody agrees with. Maxton
would get up and say &#8220;We are against these enemies. They support
king and country. They support the army. But we are with the people
and the ordinary soldier and the rank and file.&#8221; All these
abstractions. Maxton, he was a marvellous man for making the
abstraction revolutionary.&#8217;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">$64,000 question</h4>

<p class="fst">What of the issues for the left in Britain today, like the race
question? &#8216;I don&#8217;t see the race question in Britain as the race
question in the vast colonial areas. The dominant question in Britain
today is this: are you for the Labour Party or are you for the
revolution? And the race question has to fit itself into that. That
is the question in Britain.</p>

<p>&#8216;When black people raise the race question it means to them a
lot more than when the Labour Party votes in favour of their
struggle. For them, that&#8217;s something in the paper. It means little.
Only coloured people in Britain really feel race. An Englishman in
Manchester or Salisbury or Dorset voting in favour of the black
struggle, to him that is something abstract.&#8217; <br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Battling Stalinism</h4>

<p class="fst">What, then, of the colonial world, and the problems which beset
African states like Nkrumah&#8217;s Ghana after independence? &#8216;I
believe that in many an African country there was ultimately no
distinction between the party and the state. At first the development
of a party that had Marxism as its policy was undoubtedly valuable. I
want to make it clear, in many a formerly undeveloped country the
organisation of a party is a tremendous step forward. They leave the
tribe, they leave the religious structure and they make a political
structure. But if that political structure becomes a representation
of the politics of the advanced country, there is a hell of a mess.
That happened in Trinidad and it happened in many colonial
territories because the Communist Party, the Stalinists, picked up
these things and went to the colonial territories and said the party
is what makes politics, and the party is our party ... and once the
struggle began as to which party, the organisation became dominant.&#8217;</p>

<p>The battle which James had with Stalinism was clearly the ongoing
political fight of his life. He feels that it was a job well done.
&#8216;Today it is becoming more clear that Stalinism is mainly a
projection of the need of certain sections of the movement for
political power. I wouldn&#8217;t say that the back of Stalinism is
broken, but there is a movement against them [Stalinists], not just a
few intellectuals or writers. People don&#8217;t rush to them as the hope
of the future as they used to do.</p>

<p>&#8216;And if you will allow me to say so, and this is particularly
true in the former colonial territories, they understand Stalinism
owing to the fact that James and other colonial writers not only
spoke of independence but pointed out the evils of Stalinism. It was
a tremendous struggle, you know, to make people understand that the
Soviet Union, and the Communist Party it influenced, was the enemy of
the revolutionary movement, but it was done and the theoretical
foundations have been laid. We made clear that the things which
happened were not the mistakes of leaders or the weaknesses of
individuals, but were the result of the structure and system which
grew up to produce them. I think that is one of the most important
things we left behind.&#8217;</p>

<p>I asked about his fiction; does he have any favourite pieces now?</p>

<p>&#8216;No. For this reason. I began by expecting to write fiction and
to write literature and about society in a traditional way. But I
came to Britain, joined the movement and became a political analyst
and writer.&#8217; &#8216;And activist?&#8217; I suggested. &#8216;Yes, activist.
Good. I left fiction behind. I don&#8217;t think anything should be made
about my fiction. I hadn&#8217;t really become soaked in the Marxist
movement. I was still on the surface.&#8217;</p>

<p>On the surface today, I put it to him finally, there is much
pessimism about the prospects for revolution. &#8216;Well my friend, I
want to say something about this. When I look at the revolutionary
movement over the ages, over the decades, for me emerges one thing.</p>

<p>&#8216;You never know when it is going to explode. The revolutionary
movement is a series of explosions when the regular routine of things
reaches a pitch where it cannot go on. To me that&#8217;s a philosophical
question based on history and I am never in any doubt &#8211; I am in
doubt for tomorrow, maybe &#8211; but I am never in any doubt for the day
after tomorrow. It has been a fundamental part of my outlook, a
statement of Marx early on, that the revolution comes like a thief in
the night.</p>

<p>&#8216;I believe, you know, that the Marxist theory is a scientific,
intellectual theory such as the world has never seen before, and
properly used, properly thought of, always with the feeling that
history brings things new, that you didn&#8217;t see before &#8211; with the
basic Marxist guide you can manage. On the whole we can view the
future with a certain confidence; we have a method that is aware of
the past, but open to the future.&#8217;</p>
