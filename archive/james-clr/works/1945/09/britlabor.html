<p class="fst">The American Negro press in particular has come out in very
gratifying jubilation over the victory of the British Labor Party in
the elections. The victory &ndash; and a very great, victory it is &ndash;
seems to herald independence or self-government for colonial peoples.
And in recent years the Negro people in the United States have shown
a serious interest in the fate of the hundreds of millions oppressed
and exploited by British imperialism.</p>

<p>True, some of the more experienced journalists, like George
Schuyler of the <strong>Pittsburgh Courier</strong>, are skeptical. Schuyler,
in fact, states bluntly: &ldquo;After all, British Labor has a stake
in imperialism.&rdquo; This is the crux of the matter and illustrates
a fundamental problem in all Labor politics.</p>

<p>Has British Labor got at stake in imperialism? The answer depends
upon the definition of the term British Labor.</p>

<p><em>The British working class, in the majority of its millions, has
no stake in imperialism. A very small section has shared in the
profits that British capital sucked out of the Empire. These few
received higher wages than the average and formed the British
aristocracy of labor. They were the social basis of the parliamentary
Labor Party and dominated it.</em></p>

<p>The British labor leaders and the trade union bureaucrats express
the aims, wishes and ideas of this section of labor. In alliance with
them are the parliamentarians, municipal councillors, journalists,
school teachers and other white collar workers who turn away from the
regular capitalist parties and embrace the labor movement.</p>

<p>All these form a tight caucus sitting on top of the labor
movement. They certainly have a stake in imperialism. They cannot
help it. They</p>

<p>do not want any radical change in the Britain of today. Despite
their socialistic words, they have much the same type of political
mentality as Hillman and Murray. Their socialism is merely a
decoration, for a program of large public works, government
intervention in or control of banks and bankrupt industries, more
social security, better educational facilities for workers, etc.</p>

<p>This means <em>reforming</em> the capitalist system in Britain, but
giving it a new name &ndash; socialism. It sounds better.</p>

<p><em>Every child knows that capitalist Britain is bound tight to the
Empire. Without India and the African colonies the present economic
structure of Britain would fly apart into a million pieces. So that
the Labor leaders by leaving capitalist Britain virtually intact are
thereby compelled to retain all the links of empire.</em></p>

<p>But the large majority of the British workers, eighty per cent at
least, if not more, would support freedom for India and the African
colonies tomorrow. They want a new Britain &ndash; a socialist
Britain. They are not very clear in their own minds as to how this
socialist Britain will function. Roughly, they think that if
capitalist property were taken over by a socialist government, if the
land, were nationalized, and if the economy was planned, Britain
would get a new-start.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Real Change Needed</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>They are perfectly right.</em></p>

<p>What is required is a total reorganization of the economy of Great
Britain AND a total reorganization of the economy of the colonies.
Instead of a relationship ox exploitation between capitalist Britain
and the colonies, what is required is a relationship of co-operation
between socialist Britain and emancipated colonies.</p>

<p><em>But so long as the Labor leaders hold on to the essentials of a
capitalistic Britain, with a camouflage of socialism, so long they
are going, to hold on to the colonial Empire, with a camouflage of
freedom.</em></p>

<p><em>Fortunately, the crisis in all fields is so sharp, today that
camouflage is on its last legs. The British masses are on the alert.
They mean business. The. colonial masses are on the alert also. They
also mean business.</em></p>

<p>The struggle for a socialist Britain and emancipated colonies has
just begun. It is not going to be easy. When the Workers Party and
revolutionary socialists celebrate the great victory of Labor in the
elections, we do so because we rejoice at the fact that the great
body of the people have placed the power in the hands of their own
party. There can be no more excuses. The Labor leaders have the
power. The masses are waiting impatiently. The leaders either must
act or expose themselves.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Support the Masses</h4>

<p class="fst">The American Negroes, therefore, must cultivate no illusions about
immediate emancipation for the colonies. At the same time they must
not encourage the slightest cynicism. The thing to do now is to
encourage both the working masses of Britain and the colonial peoples
to demand genuine socialist politics from the Labor leaders. If
American Negroes, through their organizations, can make their desires
for colonial freedom known to the colonial peoples, to the Labor
government <em>and to the British masses</em> they would be doing a
valuable work.</p>

<p><em>Britain and the colonies are in a ferment over the great
victory. The progressive intervention of American Negroes could add
to the ferment, would: have a dramatic effect and push the whole
movement forward.</em></p>
