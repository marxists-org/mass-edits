<p class="fst">On the ground that their confessions were extorted by torture, the
U.S. Supreme Court upheld the petition of four young Negroes against
sentence of death by the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>

<p>In May 1933 an elderly white man was murdered in Pompano, Florida.
Immediately the murder was discovered, between 25 and 40 Negroes were
arrested, among them the petitioners. From May 14 to May 20, the 25
to 40 Negro suspects were subjected to questioning and
cross-questioning, resulting in the &ldquo;confessions of the four
accused.&rdquo; The evidence compels Justice Black to state that &ldquo;the
prisoners at no time during the week were permitted to see or confer
with counsel or a single friend or relative. When carried singly from
his cell and subjected to questioning, each found himself, a single
prisoner, surrounded in a fourth floor jail room by four to ten men,
the County Sheriff, his deputies, a convict guard, and other white
officers and citizens of the community. As an ex-Ku Klux Klanner and
a Southerner, Black understood well the significance of the fourth
floor. A Negro knows that at any time in these proceedings he is
liable to be thrown out of the window, after which his questioners
would unitedly swear that he had jumped.</p>

<p>The necessary confessions were obtained. Justice Black quotes,
&ldquo;They bring one of them at a time backwards and forwards until
they confessed.&rdquo; They were tried and sentenced on no other
evidence than these confessions.</p>

<p>Here is a tale, one of ten thousand, of the organized terror
against Negroes, by citizens, Ku Klux Klanners, lynch mobs, judges,
sheriffs, policemen, state governors, and Federal authorities, by
which the millions of Negroes are kept in economic and political
subjection for the greater glory of capitalist profits and the
maintenance of American &ldquo;democracy.&rdquo; Every year there are
hundreds of similar cases, most of which do not reach the Supreme
Court at all.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Justice Black Prepares for War</h4>

<p class="fst">Today, however, there is a war in Europe, in which the American
capitalists are planning to intervene. British and German imperialism
are at each other&rsquo;s throats for the redivision of the world,
and American capitalism seeks to become the dominant world power. The
American people must be mobilized for war, and such is the bankruptcy
of the capitalist system, that in its mad pursuit of imperialist
aims, it has to fall back on the tattered, torn, and blood-stained
slogan of the &ldquo;defense of democracy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Supreme Court therefore takes this case as a platform from
which to pontificate on the evils of totalitarianism and the benefits
of &ldquo;democracy,&rdquo; as exemplified in the Supreme Court of
the United States. Justice Black has the impudence to make more than
one reference to the Fourteenth Amendment, which was thrown into the
waste-paper basket by many Southern states the day after it was
passed and has remained there since. He speaks of &ldquo;liberty-loving
people,&rdquo; pictures the Supreme Court as defender of the rights
of &ldquo;the poor, the ignorant, the numerically weak, the
friendless and the powerless,&rdquo; and contrasts the American way
with the &ldquo;rack, the thumbscrew, the wheel, solitary
confinement,&rdquo; and the exalted power of &ldquo;some governments
to punish manufactured crime dictatorially.&rdquo; He concludes on a
high note: &ldquo;Under our constitutional system, courts stand
against any winds that blow as havens of refuge ...&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Negro People Know Better!</h4>

<p class="fst">Some of the Scottsboro boys are still in jail. Every year Negroes
are lynched, not only those that are listed in the press but the
quiet, well-organized doing-away with Negroes who in one way or
another threaten &ldquo;white supremacy.&rdquo; In state after state
Negroes cannot vote. They are deprived of their social and political
rights by brute force. The decisions of all courts in their favor are
ignored or flouted. They are constantly insulted, beaten up,
terrorized. Their groans and protests, sometimes subdued, now flaring
up as the persecution becomes intolerable, are the permanent
accompaniment of American life. And yet this ex-member of the Klan,
with his eyes on his script and his mind on imperialist war, reads
his piece about American courts being a haven of refuge against winds
that blow.</p>

<p>The press has taken its cue and has repeated in swelling chorus
the theme of the distinguished soloist. &ldquo;We are not as they.&rdquo;
And if &ldquo;we,&rdquo; whose courts are a haven against all the
winds that blow, are not as &ldquo;they,&rdquo; the dictatorships,
shouldn&rsquo;t we be ready to die for these privileges? The fifteen
million cheated Negroes, the millions of unemployed and their
starving families, will know how to treat this impudent piece of war
propaganda, this blatant self-justification, this stupid attempt to
throw dust into the eyes of the Negro people.</p>

<p>Justice Black has lifted the case of these unfortunate Negroes
(for if there was any evidence against them it would have been heard)
from its place as one of a never-ending list of tyranny and injustice
into a plea for the support of American and its imperialistic
adventures aboard. But the tyranny and violence of three hundred
years are not pushed aside so easily. They will be pushed aside not
by rosy-hued lies from a war-monger&rsquo;s loud-speaker, but by the
united voice of millions of workers, black and white, shouting the
slogans of socialism. They will be destroyed only when the system
which breeds them is destroyed. Our aim is the destruction not only
of the naked dictatorships abroad but of the thinly veiled
dictatorships at home.</p>
