<p class="fst">The Republican Party has issued a statement on its policy for the
election in 1940. It is not too early for the Negroes to begin a
careful consideration of the programs and candidates at the coming
election.</p>

<p>The Republican party for years masqueraded as the friend of the
Negro. To quote Frederick Douglas&rsquo; famous words, &ldquo;The
Republican Party is the deck and all else is the sea.&rdquo; People
have claimed that the adherence of the Negro to this particular
position for so many years is proof of the Negro&rsquo;s
backwardness, stupidity, and ineptitude for politics. It was nothing
of the kind. Here again the Negro has been vilely slandered.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Why Negroes Backed Republicans</h4>

<p class="fst">After the Civil War, the Negroes, contrary to the general belief,
flocked to the polls and lived an intense political life. Naturally
they supported the Republican Party. The Republican party was the
party of Lincoln; in it were revolutionary radicals like Thaddeus
Stevens and Sumner who agitated for expropriation of the Southern
landlords and &ldquo;forty acres and a mule&rdquo; for the Negroes.</p>

<p>Within their limits, the Republicans, anxious to crush their
rivals, played a progressive role &ndash; small wonder that the
Negroes voted for them. This they did in unusually large numbers.</p>

<p>Not that they were not tempted. In Virginia, for instance, the
Southern landowners embraced the doctrine of Negro suffrage, and made
an attempt to win the Negro vote. They posed as friends of the
Negroes and in addition to promises they made threats: If the Negroes
would not vote as their Southern employers wished, they swore to
drive them from employment. This was a very real threat, carried out
without mercy. But in those early days the Negroes would not be
coerced. Some few Negroes were bribed and even won elections against
Republicans with the support of the Southerners. But the majority of
the Negroes voted solidly for the Republican Party.</p>

<p>In fact, far from being apathetic about politics, it was the
political energy of the Negroes that drove the old Southern
landowning class into suppressing the Negro vote at all costs.</p>

<p>In Virginia the whites outnumbered the Negroes. Soon after the Civil War they gained a
political majority and controlled the government. They would not vote
funds for public education and insisted on the full payment of the
interest on a huge public debt. William Malone led a split from the
government party and rallied the poor farmers and the middle-classes
against the reactionaries. <em>The Negroes voted in great numbers for Malone.</em></p>

<p>His party, the Readjusters, was returned with a majority and,
backed by the middle classes, and the poor, white and black, Malone
reduced the public debt and raised the appropriations for public
education. The Southern landowners saw that this combination of the
poorer classes, both black and white, meant death for them. They
sought for the weakest link in the chain of their enemies and found
it in the slogan against &ldquo;Black Domination.&rdquo; With this
slogan, and by intimidation and terror, they split the ranks of their
enemies and regained power.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Active in Populist Movement</h4>

<p class="fst">Near the end of the century, the Populist movement asserted
itself. Once again the Negro farmers rallied to it. The reactionaries
used the old tactics of &ldquo;Black Domination&rdquo; allied with
violence. In vain the white farmers in the South protested that this
new struggle had nothing to do with the conflicts of the Civil War.
Once more their ranks were disrupted. It was then that in despair the
poor and middle-class whites decided that to have the Negroes with
them meant the ruin of their course and finally acquiesced in the
exclusion of the Negroes from politics. Under the powerful pressure
of legalized lynching, the Negroes gradually sank into political
apathy.</p>

<p>The Southerners rallied round the Democratic Party. The Negroes,
when they voted at all, were driven into the Republican camp. In the
days when the Democrats were systematically excluding them from
participation in politics, the Negro&rsquo;s only hope for salvation
seemed the Republican Party. In many respects the Republican Party
was indeed the deck, a very small and slippery deck it is true, but a
drowning man catches at much less than the Republican Party, and the
Negroes were drowning.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Broke with Republicans in 1932</h4>

<p class="fst">With the coming of the New Deal, however, the Negroes sat up and
took notice. A New Deal. If any group of people in this country need
a New Deal the Negroes did! They rallied to Roosevelt in 1936 and
carried consternation into the ranks of the Republicans. The
Republican High Command appointed Dr. Bunche of Howard University to
make a special investigation into the reasons for the desertion of
the Negroes, though why they should have needed a special
investigation to find out what everybody knew, passes ordinary
comprehension. But the New Deal has failed. It is now a corpse. The
Negroes have begun to realize that there is nothing in it for them.
The result is the beginning of a swing back to the Republicans, as
seen in a Philadelphia election some months ago.</p>

<p>Swing back to what, however? What have the Republicans to offer?
In their new draft program, the Republicans make a strong plea for
the Negro vote. What they offer we must examine closely. But this
much is already clear. 1940 is a great turning point for the large
masses of Negro voters. They know that the Republican Party has
nothing to offer, and after eight years of the New Deal they are in
as much misery as ever they were. They form one-third of the ten
million unemployed in the country. Roosevelt slashes at WPA and
relief. He says not a word about the Anti-Lynch Bill. It seems to be
a case of either the Devil or the Deep Blue Sea.</p>

<p>But in 1940 there is a way out. There is no need to limit oneself
to the reactionary Republicans or the hypocritical New Dealers. Why
must the workers continually trail behind the bosses? What we want
is a Labor Party, a party of the workers and the farmers, white and
black. If we are to form it, however, we must start laying the basis
for it now.</p>
