<p class="fst">The sharecropper was one of the particular darlings of Roosevelt&rsquo;s
fireside chats. He was really <em>the</em> forgotten man. He was at the
bottom of the one-third of a nation. How has he fared under the
benevolent (in words) rule of the defunct New Deal? Let us hear again
from the man on the spot:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;I am afraid it is getting monotonous to write of
the nauseating poverty of the cotton sharecroppers, tenants and day
laborers. So much has been written about it that it seems that
everyone should know all the details. Yet it has to be seen and lived
to really understand to what degradation human beings have fallen
under the system of landlordism and capitalist exploitation. I found
one family of nine with one fork for the whole family. I leave the
scene at mealtime to your imagination. For a solid week I did not
once get a chance to sit down comfortably simply because the few
chairs the croppers posses are generally of the cane seat variety
with the seat missing.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;To understand the bitter wrath under the surface
of their feelings you must realize that grievances are piling, up
because of little economic advantages which croppers used to enjoy
are one by one being eliminated. It used to be, for instance, that
wood for cooking and heating was free. But the rapid clearing of the
land has finally resulted in the cropper having to buy coal. Hunting
and fishing used to be counted on to supplement their scanty fare.
But fish and game laws and license requirements have stopped a
practically free source of food. The landlord seems unconcerned about
these things. He stops his croppers from having pigs and chickens for
fear that croppers will steal his com for feed. The cropper would be
quite willing to grow his own corn but that is not permitted because
it would take time away from the cotton crop. The same thing goes for
a vegetable garden. And so an accumulation of grievances builds up
and makes the cropper eager for the message of unionism as a partial
answer to his economic problems ...</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;I wonder how those people survive the winter.
Pneumonia is bound to get them. Tuberculosis has gotten two of them
in the &rsquo;Lost Colony&rsquo; camp in the last six weeks. The
tuberculosis was not contracted in &lsquo;Lost Colony&rsquo; camp. It
was contracted in their work as sharecroppers, living in houses unfit
for habitation and eating food unfit for consumption.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&ldquo;No Bosses After Awhile&rdquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">Although their state has been getting worse with the general
decline of the capitalist system, it is nothing new. What is new is a
united attempt among the croppers to fight for something approaching
human living standards. The croppers are organizing. Into two unions,
the, STFU and the UCAPAWA (the Southern Tenant Farmers Union and the
United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing and Allied Workers of America),
they are organizing. Black and white, they are organizing.</p>

<p>And in spite of all repressions, they are organizing. When they
meet at a cropper&rsquo;s cabin, there are defense guards posted up
and down the road. But the morale is good, whether at a local meeting
in a cabin or a district meeting. They begin ordinarily by singing
<em>Freedom</em>, their own song, two of the many stanzas of which go
as follows:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center" width="380">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">Oh Freedom, Oh Freedom,<br />
There&rsquo;ll be freedom after a while,<br />
&rsquo;Cause before I&rsquo;ll be a slave<br />
I&rsquo;ll be buried in my grave,<br />
So there&rsquo;ll be some freedom after a while.<br />
Boss&rsquo;ll miss me, Bossl&rsquo;ll miss me,<br />
Boss&rsquo;ll miss me after a while,<br />
&rsquo;Cause before I&rsquo;ll be a slave<br />
I&rsquo;ll be buried in my grave,<br />
So there&rsquo;ll be no bosses after a while.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
</td>

<h4>Watch January 10th</h4>

<p class="fst">Our correspondent attended the meeting of the leaders of the
southeast Missouri locals of the UCAPAWA.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;108 leaders arrived in time for the meeting.
Several dozen more didn&rsquo;t get there because of breakdowns in
their dilapidated cars. The camp is from 60 to 140 miles from the
cotton district, as a meeting in the cotton district cannot take
place in our free country.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;The meeting was for the purpose of instructing
leaders as to the correct steps to take in the imminent crisis.
Evictees are already being notified to vacate their land by January
1st, which, with ten days&rsquo; grace, will mean January 10th.
Usually the planters do not give this notice until after Christmas
... They are that kind-hearted. But this year they just can&rsquo;t
wait. Their greed for the government payment, in which the cropper
won&rsquo;t share if the landowner switches to day labor, is so
strong that they won&rsquo;t take a chance on a last minute ruling by
the AAA which may upset their plans of getting their mitts on that
government check. It is known by now that if the landowner gets the
entire AAA check his labor cost for making a cotton crop is entirely
absorbed by the government, so that his cotton crop costs the
landowner nothing, neither effort nor money. The situation is
comparable to the government meeting a factory payroll and permitting
the owner of the factory to have the product &hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&ldquo;This Ain&rsquo;t Our Government&rdquo;</h4>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;A social explosion may take place on January 10th
... There is no place for these landless, homeless people to go
except their 93 acre camp near Poplar Bluff. We are looking for
thousands of families to start marching towards the camp. The Chamber
of Commerce of Poplar Bluff has already passed a motion refusing them
access to their own land, in order to keep them out of &lsquo;their
county&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Croppers are not yet strong. They are in two unions instead of
one. They are opposed by the united strength of reaction. But they
are gaining one advantage that must eventually sweep everything
before it &ndash; the realization of their own strength, the
knowledge that they must fight, black and white, together. As one
cropper put it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t our government. The sheriff ain&rsquo;t
our sheriff, the governor ain&rsquo;t our governor, the president
ain&rsquo;t our president. Some day we&rsquo;ll change that.&rdquo;</p>
