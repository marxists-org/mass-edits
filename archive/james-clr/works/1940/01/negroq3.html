<p class="fst">Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and
the other a publican. This famous tale of the holy scripture was
reenacted once more in 1932. You remember what happened in the
Gospels. The Pharisee was the man who boasted of what he had done. He
had paid his dues, he fasted so many days a week. He thanked God that
he was a righteous man and not a scoundrel like the damned publican.
But the publican didn&rsquo;t pretend, he didn&rsquo;t say he had
done this and that and the other. He said he was a sinner. That&rsquo;s
all. He begged for mercy, it is true, but that isn&rsquo;t important
for us.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Twentieth-Century Pharisees</h4>

<p class="fst">Look at the New Dealers. These Pharisees have for years been
telling the whole world and Negroes what fine fellows they are. The
Negroes should love them. They are the men for &ldquo;true&rdquo;
democracy; they want to build a new world of righteousness and peace,
in which the lion will lie down with the lamb, in which the Southern
plantation-owner will give a square deal to the sharecropper. They
say, &ldquo;Discriminate against the Negro? Not we. Look how many
Negroes there are in the WPA white-collar jobs and working in relief
bureaus, etc. We thank God,&rdquo; say the New Dealers, &ldquo;that
we are not like other men, even as these Republicans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now comes a fine exposure of these righteous rascals. A few days
ago Miles Paige, a Negro Magistrate in Harlem, was named by Mayor
LaGuardia for a seat on the Special Sessions bench at $12,000 a year.
The Negro press as usual hails this as proof of the &ldquo;great
progress&rdquo; of Negroes. It is proof of nothing of the kind. No
Negro who knows the history of his race needs any proof of its
capacity to fill any office in this country. Furthermore, Paige&rsquo;s
appointment does not raise the income of one Negro sharecropper or
one Negro factory worker or one Negro unemployed. And these are the
people with whom we are chiefly concerned. Appointments like this one
of Paige cannot lift the great mass of oppressed Negroes. When the
great masses of Negroes move, they will create opportunities for ten
thousand Paiges. That is not to say that such appointments are not to
be supported not only by Negroes but by the whole labor movement. The
Negroes have a right to posts everywhere. The Socialist Workers
Party, for instance, condemns those who join the bourgeois army. But
as for the right of Negroes to join the army if they want to, and on
equal terms with the whites &ndash; that we support.</p>

<h4>Where&rsquo;s the Catch?</h4>

<p class="fst">But now comes a mystery. Paige was to be seated on Tuesday,
January 2nd, but the ceremony was postponed indefinitely. The
<strong>Amsterdam News</strong> of January 13 gives us some indication why.</p>

<p>LaGuardia is flirting with the New Dealers, with an eye to the
presidential elections. He is typical of them, with his large words
and small concessions. But since the Harlem riots of 1935, La Guardia
has a wholesome respect for Harlem Negroes. And since Lehman defeated
Dewey only by the aid of the Negroes&rsquo; vote, all these
progressive fakers are at their wits&rsquo; end to keep the Negro
vote. So LaGuardia runs around in Harlem, he has lunch with Bill
Robinson sitting near him, he builds a housing project or two (where
fifty are needed), and he appoints Negroes to posts they have not
held before. First Justice Bolin. And now Paige.</p>

<p>But behold! Roosevelt in Washington lives only by grace of those
Southern landlords, without whom the Democratic Party is nothing.
These fellows are not going to stand for any vice-president or
cabinet minister who is a &ldquo;nigger-lover.&rdquo; So Washington
warns LaGuardia. He is leaning too heavily towards the Negro race.
You cannot discriminate in favor of Negroes, you know. One judge
every twenty years or so is enough. If you go on like that you
discredit yourself, and your future with us of the Democratic Party
is gloomy. Hence, says the <strong>Amsterdam News</strong>, Paige&rsquo;s
appointment still awaits confirmation.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Tweedledum and ...</h4>

<p class="fst">So here we are, my friends, the &ldquo;little flower&rdquo; of
&ldquo;democracy&rdquo; and the New Deal, herald angels of equality
between man and man, conspiring to save their immortal souls and to
placate the viciousness of Southern reactionaries at the expense of
one Negro being made a judge &ndash; one Negro, be it noted.</p>

<p>Here and there a Negro may squeeze into an appointment. But
salvation for the race from any of these Republicans or Democrats who
have systematically deceived the Negro people for seventy-five years?
No. The Republicans make no promises. The New Dealers make them but
do not mean it. And that is the only difference between them.</p>
