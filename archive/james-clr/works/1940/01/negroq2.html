<p class="fst">The Stalinists are new whipping up a furious campaign on <em>Gone
With the Wind</em>. Their methods are an exact replica of the methods
of the Moscow bureaucracy. When Stalin decides to shoot some
thousands of Old Bolsheviks, or to denounce Germany (or to praise
Germany), or to invade Finland, there suddenly appear in the Moscow
press, letters, resolutions, exhortations, praising the particular
move, extolling it as the highest wisdom, and pointing out that this
is exactly what the Soviet workers have been waiting for. Similarly
with the Communist Party in every country.</p>

<p>In its issue of January 5th, the <strong>Daily Worker</strong> prints nearly
two columns of letters, of which the following quotation
characterizes the tone: &ldquo;Well, I simply can&rsquo;t hold it
back any longer. Your excellent and Marxist handling of that smelly
film <em>Gone With the Wind</em> was a sparkling ...&rdquo; The whole
Stalinist community, we are made to understand, is simply boding with
rage at the slanders against the Negro people embodied in the film.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Recalling Another Film!</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>Gone With the Wind</em>, however, is not the first film that
deals with Negro conditions in the Old South, and a little knowledge
will be sufficient to show that, behind all this noisy parade, the
Stalinists, here as elsewhere, are deceiving the Negro people, and
serving exclusively the interests of their paymasters in the Kremlin.</p>

<p>Some ten years ago, when the Moscow bureaucracy had not yet
entirely broken with the revolutionary doctrines of Lenin and
Trotsky, it invited some Negroes to Moscow to make a film which would
depict lynching and the other features of Negro life in America. The
company was selected and reached Moscow. American capitalism,
however, realizes that, although it can deceive the people at home,
it would be difficult for it to pose abroad as the friend of
democracy, if its treatment of Negroes were exposed in so popular a
medium as a film. Washington was at that time engaged in negotiations
with Moscow over recognition of the Soviet Government, and Washington
made it quite clear, that if the Russians made any such film it would
be regarded as a serious obstacle in the way of an understanding.</p>

<p>The Moscow bureaucracy reacted in characteristic fashion. It
capitulated before the capitalists. It sought to deceive and browbeat
the workers. The Negroes who had gone to Moscow were told that it was
impossible for the Soviet production studios to find time and room to
make the film. When some of the Negroes protested, several attempts
were made to frame them as drunkards, disorderly persons, etc. in
order to discredit in advance any protest that they might make when
they returned home. In all this the <strong>Daily Worker</strong>, that now
cannot contain its rage at Hollywood&rsquo;s crimes, played its usual
obedient and servile role as tout for the Kremlin&rsquo;s crimes.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Langston Hughes&rsquo; Role</h4>

<p class="fst">Among the Negroes who went to Moscow to &ldquo;help in the making
of the film was Langston Hughes, the Negro poet. Hughes is one of the
most pertinacious fellow-travelers of the Stalinists. He is, or was,
vice-president of their stooge organization, the American Writers
Congress. He has represented the Stalinist point of view at
international congresses in Europe. Some of his works are published
by Stalinist publishing houses. When the Moscow bureaucracy tried to
impose its lies on the Negroes who had gone to Moscow to make the
Negro film, Hughes accepted the &ldquo;explanation&rdquo; entirely
and cooperated with the Moscow bureaucrats, to smash down the
opposition of those who refused to accept this transparent lie.</p>

<p>But the Kremlin&rsquo;s policy changes, and with it changes
everything, from the clothes the Stalinists wear to their attitude to
Negro films. Not so long ago Hollywood wanted to produce a film on
the Old South. This film, <em>Way Down South</em>, portrayed the old
Southern slaveowners as fine and gallant gentlemen, and showed the
slaves as being contented with their slavery. One of the writers of
the script was no other than Langston Hughes. Of this the Stalinists,
who must have known it, had nothing whatever to say.</p>

<p>Now the line of the Kremlin changes once more. Their reviewer,
Howard Rushmore, writes a review of <em>Gone With the Wind</em>, which,
in the opinion of this column, was infinitely less iniquitous than
the actual preparation of a pro-slavery script. But the Stalinists
become consumed with virtuous rage, dismiss him, and are now carrying
on their phoney campaign. This deceives nobody who knows them.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&ldquo;Rediscovers&rdquo; Negro Question</h4>

<p class="fst">In 1929 it was the policy of Moscow to carry on a vicious campaign
against all capitalists, and every section of the labor movement that
was not Stalinist. That was their notorious third period. In
accordance with this line, they were prepared to make the film
exposing American capitalism. As soon, however, as the capitalists
gave any indication that they opposed it, the Moscow bureaucrats, as
usual, capitulated. From 1934, on the other hand, they began their
new policy of support to the &ldquo;democracies&rdquo; against the
fascist imperialists. During this period, behind all their noisy
talk, they capitulated on every front to what they called the
&ldquo;democratic forces.&rdquo; Roosevelt was their hero, Eleanor
Roosevelt their heroine, and their chief care was to penetrate as far
as possible into those elements of capitalist &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;
which they thought might be useful in furthering the alliance between
America and Russia. They shoved the Negro movement as far as possible
into the Negro National Congress.</p>

<p>With the Hitler-Stalin pact this &ldquo;fourth period&rdquo; came
to an end. Stalin now wishes them to build as much opposition as
possible in the camp of the &ldquo;democracies&rdquo; in order to
assist the victory of the Hitler-Stalin camp. Therefore they
rediscover the revolutionary instincts of the Negro people; they
begin a great drive in Harlem. And they tear their hair and gnash
their teeth at the crimes of <em>Gone With the Wind</em>.</p>

<p>To conclude, the film is dangerous and must be exposed and
boycotted. But infinitely more dangerous, and therefore to be exposed
and boycotted to an infinitely greater degree, is this mischievous
manipulation of Negro militancy in the interest of Moscow
bureaucrats.</p>
