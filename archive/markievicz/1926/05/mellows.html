<P class="fst">Liam Mellows joined the Fianna in its very early days. Colbert and
Heuston belonged to the same group of boys and were his comrades.</P>
<P>Liam always had faith in its ultimate success, and, through all
our difficulties, his steadfastness, courage and gaiety influenced
all he met, and made us lean on him, and as time went on put more and
more confidence in him.</P>
<P>He loved the young people and believed in them. He believed, too,
that the Republic would be finally established and recognised
internationally through the self-sacrifice and courage of the youth
of Ireland.</P>
<P>One little scene between Liam and myself always rises before my
vision when his name is mentioned. It was one of the unforgettable
things that showed the greatness of his growing soul. I would like
all our young patriots to know it, too, and to think of Liam when
they are starting out on the road of life, and the crossroads are
reached. One road leads into the darkness. It is only lit by the
starry crowns of martyrs and by the lights of Heaven in the far, far
distance. The other road is bright and gay, and leads to worldly
success, to pleasure and money; the darkness at the end is hardly
seen. Liam knew instinctively that the dark road led to a happy
death, to comradeship with the noble dead and to immortality, while
the bright and sunny path he scorned had brought many a confident and
clever lad to die in the end the death of a Judas or of Carey, or
Castlereagh or MacNally.</P>
<P>It was during the very early days of the Fianna, and we of the
Executive Council were very depressed. There were hardly any branches
of the Fianna outside Dublin, few workers and little money. Liam came
to me one day and said to me, very quietly and humbly, but with a
twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of giving up my job,
and I&rsquo;m wondering if you&rsquo;ll approve.&rdquo; He went on to
tell me that his job was a poor one, and that he did not care about
it, and that he proposed chucking it for something that he would like
better, and that though it would not be worth much at the beginning
he believed he would be able to work it up all right.</P>
<P>He then made the amazing statement that he contemplated going on
the road to organise the Fianna. He went on to tell me that he had a
bicycle and a good new coat, and that once he got clear of Dublin it
would be very cheap work for he need never take a train, and he was
sure that in most places he would be able to find sympathisers and
friends who would give him a bed, and save hotel expenses. He asked
us to raise 3O shillings for him, to give him a start and if possible
10 shillings a week. With this he cheerfully declared he would be
alright; indeed, money was hardly necessary, for he was sure that the
movement would always find friends who would put him up. But he would
just like to know that the 10 shillings was there all right in case
of emergencies. Very soon, he explained, he would cease to be a
burden to us, for he believed that soon he would be able to provide
the money for his own expenses, with something over for the
&ldquo;Executive from the affiliation fees of the branches he would
establish&rdquo;. Of course, it was all nonsense about his job, but
it was Liam&rsquo;s way of putting off and always belittling the
sacrifices he was prepared to make.</P>
<P>Headquarters thought it over and hesitated. Some thought it too
great a sacrifice, as if he gave up his job he would probably not be
able to get another, and the risk of failure was great. A boy going
out alone into the unknown to try and induce boys to take on their
young shoulders that which the men had shirked for more than a
generation sounded like some story out of the far off, glorious days
of Gaelic greatness, it didn&rsquo;t sound like a business
proposition for an organisation in the twentieth century. And yet it
was our Liam, the wisest of us all, who was expounding the scheme, a
merry twinkle in his blue eyes when he saw some of the boyish faces
of amazement listening to him.</P>
<P>Most of the Headquarters&rsquo; staff shared with me the belief
that it is wrong to prevent or dissuade anyone sacrificing themselves
for Ireland, if that is their wish, and so it came about that Liam
got his way, gave up his job, and took up his cross for Ireland.</P>
<P>From that day his life was one of striving and struggling along
the Calvary of his own choosing, his eyes fixed on the ultimate goal,
never looking back. He had that faith in God, which opens the
spiritual eyes of a pure soul, and so he knew instinctively that
sacrifice alone is the coin in which we must pay for the things
beyond and above material value that we would attain to and give to
our country. So Liam, with a boyish faith, sacrificed himself, his
life, every hour of it, for Ireland, to obtain freedom for her.</P>
<P>We, his friends, know just a little of what he sacrificed. Love
smiled at him and he bade her wait; ambition courted him at every
turn, he scarcely glanced her way; friendship pulled at his
heartstrings; rest, comfort, peace, with inviting eyes, mocked him as
he gently passed them by. Every joy of life that tempted him to pause
and turn aside from the path of his choosing was but one more of the
golden coins of sacrifice offered by him &ldquo;for the glory of God
and the honour of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
<P>His death was but the culmination of a life of sacrifice, the
payment of the last golden coin.</P>
<P>We may weep for the happy memory of him, but no tears may be shed
in sorrow and pity for the great death he died. They would be an
unworthy tribute to one who we know found that higher peace and
ecstasy that is only found in complete sacrifice, and that is God&rsquo;s
great gift to his martyrs.</P>
<P>In the Fianna all his comrades loved him. He was so ambitious for
them and for Ireland and so forgetful of himself, never seeking
position, power or honours. He was full of sympathy and kindness and
always ready for a bit of fun, steadfast, reliable and honourable.</P>
<P>His fight in Galway in 1916, his work in America after his escape,
his return and the great work he did on the Headquarters&rsquo; staff
of the IRA during the Anglo-Irish War, his great speech against the
&ldquo;Treaty&rdquo; in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, his fight in the
Four Courts and his execution are public property, they belong to
Ireland and to all patriots the world over. But to his comrades of
the Fianna belong his boyish years of quiet work and training, and
the unfolding of the great character and brain that made him the man
he was and earned for him the fear and hatred of Mulcahy, who knew
that in the end Ireland must stand for Liam and the honourable and
courageous, who cared for honour and integrity more than life; and so
he had him killed.</P>
<P>Death has given immortality to Liam, immortality and power, and
Liam dead will conquer, and the Republic for which he died prevail
against her enemies.</P>
