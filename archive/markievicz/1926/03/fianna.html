<P class="fst">&ldquo;The most dangerous form of animal is a Fianna boy&rdquo;.
This quaint remark caught my ear as I entered the ruined courthouse
in Wexford. Surprised, I turned and asked, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The
answer came in a chorus, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear they brought
them handcuffed together in pairs from Waterford?&rdquo; Scarcely
credible, but true.</P>
<P>The GHQ of Na Fianna &Eacute;ireann had decided to fight the two
cases that the British Free State police had brought against the
&ldquo;boys of Wexford&rdquo; and I had come down with Mr Alec Lynn,
whom we had chosen to be our champion.</P>
<P>The trial was to be held in a small court in the half-ruined
courthouse, and we passed through the roofless hall where the British
had formerly sat to jail patriots into the meaner hall where those
who were today doing their dirty work were to sit.</P>
<P>We asked to see the boys. They were grouped together in the
gallery. At Alec Lynn&rsquo;s demand that we should have privacy, the
bayoneted soldiers and police guarding them were moved on one side,
and they were all shaking us by the hand and giving us a warm
welcome. I explained to them why we were there and told them that GHQ
were fighting this case in the interest of the organisation, and to
show up the Free State in its persecution of a boys&rsquo;
organisation. I told them that the order for individuals if arrested
not to recognise the court still stood, and if disobeyed would be
considered to be a grave offence against discipline, that I knew the
boys who had defied the Justices in the lower court would be prepared
to do so here and now, and that I knew that they were ready to go
back to jail and suffer anything that they might be made to suffer
for the Republic.</P>
<P>They asked if they might state that they pleaded in obedience to
orders from GHQ. I was delighted with the suggestion. It was arranged
that the first put up should state this for all. I told them, too,
that we were almost certain of winning, and that if we were beaten
that day, it would not matter, as we were sure to win on appeal, and
we should gain more publicity. Also, I assured them that it was not
to save them from prison that we had decided to fight the case, but
that we could win a great victory for the Fianna over the British in
spite of their allies, the Staters, and their Treason Act, by, as it
were, ambushing them from a new and unexpected quarter.</P>
<P>The fun began when the judge realised that we were putting up a
fight and that we had the redoubtable Alec Lynn to champion us. He
nearly jumped to the floor when Lynn stood up. The next shock his
nerves got was when P. Connic said that he pleaded not guilty because
he was instructed to do so by his own governing body. The Judge, to
use a descriptive phrase, &ldquo;let a roar&rdquo;. But the words
were said and he could do nothing.</P>
<P>The CID gave great sport. Alec Lynn made one of them declare on
oath that he could not swear that he, Alec Lynn, was not an Adjutant
of the Wexford Brigade IRA.</P>
<P>It was awfully funny, too, when he tried to force one of them to
read the letter found on P&aacute;draig Mac Connaicain (P. Connic).
The man stuttered and stammered, and it seemed as if he couldn&rsquo;t
read the Irish heading. Perhaps it was that he was nervous, but
however it was he made a show of the enemy he represented.</P>
<P>The judge&rsquo;s charge to the jury was the speech of a bitter
prosecuting counsel, so biased that it must have helped to get us a
just verdict. He also exhibited the careless manner in which he had
been listening to the case, as in spite of the emphasis laid on the
letter in Lynn&rsquo;s cross-examination of the CID man, the judge
referred to it so inaccurately that Lynn was able to prove it to him,
force him to bring the jury back and to explain to them that he had
been wrong in his charge, and that our counsel had been right. This
all helped to bring out the truth and a jury of clever, thoughtful
Wexford men were not going to be fooled into giving a wrong verdict.</P>
<P>The next case went as merrily. he first bit of fun was when the
police witness declared on oath that the orders were given to &ldquo;stand
at ease&rdquo;, &ldquo;right turn&rdquo;, omitting &ldquo;Attention&rdquo;
and making nonsense of the whole proceeding. Our counsel made great
fun over this. The judge strongly opposed us quoting from the British
Boy Scouts books to show that they were a military organisation run
in the interests of England, and in which the boys as part of their
routine were instructed in musketry. But Lynn got it out somehow,
also that some of their number had been guilty of robbery. He did not
mind Lynn alluding to the drilling of school children in the national
schools nor the drilling and the military names of the officers in
the Salvation Army.</P>
<P>The judge again did his best for the prosecution, and, again,
greatly assisted by us by his obvious partisanship. He omitted to
tell the jury that if there was any doubt in their minds they were
bound to give the boys the benefit of the doubt. Alec Lynn made him
bring the jury back and tell them this.</P>
<P>By the time this second victory had been gained a wildly
enthusiastic crowd had gathered in the pouring rain and ankle deep in
mud outside. Nothing mattered, only this &ndash; the Fianna had
scored a victory. Cries of &ldquo;Up the Republic!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Up
de Valera!&rdquo; echoed from every side and followed us as we walked
back to the hotel.</P>
<P>The boys told us that the best of the joke was that three loads of
timber had been brought into Waterford Jail the day before, for them
to work at, so sure had the enemy been of a conviction.</P>
