<P class="fst">Simplicity and directness of vision and love of the true and noble
are part of the attributes of youth. Our Headquarters&rsquo; staff
instinctively took the straight, hard road, and when the &ldquo;treaty&rdquo;
was signed, reaffirmed their allegiance to the Republic. Since then
the Fianna &Eacute;ireann have carried on the fight, and many a noble
boy stood true in spite of the soul-stifling misery of prison and the
horror of torture. Some, alas, went wrong and threw in their lot with
those who sold their honour to the British Government, and became
part of the English king&rsquo;s garrison in Ireland. These renegades
did England&rsquo;s dirty work, spying on their comrades who stood
true and often sending them to a cruel death. But this must not
discourage us; it must remind us that human nature is weak and
foolish, and that there are traitors everywhere, and that even among
the Twelve Disciples there was one traitor. But our faith tells us
that human nature is redeemed by the blood of those who die and
through our martyrs our cause remains holy and clean. We remember
with reverence the lads who were kidnapped or taken in battle in
every part of Ireland to be tortured and murdered because they
refused to betray their comrades and their country. It is well that
we bear in mind the message sent out by Liam Mellows, just a short
time before he faced a &ldquo;Free State&rdquo; firing squad, and
take to heart those words written by one of the wisest and greatest
of the sons of Ireland, whose death has crowned our motherland with
glory. He says,</P>
<P class="quoteb">&ldquo;The Fianna ideal can save the future. The reason
for so many young soldiers going wrong is that they never had a
proper grip of the fundamentals. They were absorbed into the movement
and fight, not educated into it. Hence no real convictions.&rdquo;</p>
<P class="fst">So I would call on the young officers of the Fianna to rally to
Liam Mellows&rsquo; last command and start on a great campaign of
education. Teach young Ireland what the English conquest is; that it
is more than a military and political one, it has a deeper and much
more dangerous significance. It stands for the conquest of the will
and the soul of the Irish people.</P>
<P>An English constitution is forced on us to impose the English
social, economic, and educational systems on us. Therefore to
reconquer Ireland for the Irish we must have complete separation from
England. The whole island must always remain one country with all the
powers of a sovereign nation.</P>
<P>Teach the boys that it rests with them to see that the rising
generation has both the power and the will to build up an Irish
civilisation, and to draw up an Irish constitution, with an Irish
system of education which will train our youth to be free,
spiritually, mentally and bodily. Let the Fianna learn that Ireland
to be really free must be, as Pearse says, &ldquo;Not free merely,
but Gaelic as well.&rdquo; Gaelic in soul, spirit, thought, and
language. This only is freedom, and it can never be attained while
Ireland is an integral part of the British Empire. To obtain this
freedom they must understand the horrors of the British civilisation
and the beauties of the old Irish civilisation which is the
foundation on which we must develop our newly-awakened self-conscious
Republic, and the Fianna must lead the way.</P>
