<P class="fst">Comrades in the Republican Army and friends, fellow Republicans,
we meet here today to do honour to two young lads who gave their
lives for Ireland two years ago.</P>
<P>Standing by their graves today, where the green grass and flowers
hold up their heads, I thought of that sad day two short years ago
when I stood by the side of their two poor mutilated bodies lying in
the mortuary of the Mater Hospital, and when we followed them &ndash;
just a few of us &ndash; followed their bodies up to this graveyard
and heard the sods falling, one by one, like drops of lead, on the
bright hopes, courageous hearts, and noble characters of these two
young lads.</P>
<P>Somehow it seemed so tragic as we stood there and the same prayer
rose to the lips of all, the prayer to worthily carry on &ndash;
carry on what these boys had died to accomplish.</P>
<P>At this anniversary we who honour them, who love them, who knew
them, renew that prayer to God in our hearts; and we will be given
the courage to dare if we must dare, to stand by if we must stand by,
and the courage to undergo death and torture even as Cole and Colley
underwent it.</P>
<P>May we be worthy to be followers of these noble boys. May their
deaths rally this generation as Emmet&rsquo;s death rallied the
generations that followed him.</P>
<P>Today we look back over the two blackest years Irish history has
ever known. Men of our own Republican Army deserted us, were bought,
tricked and cajoled by England, took up the British fight, and
carried on the treacherous part at the bidding of England. It is the
noble deaths of lads like these that have cleansed Ireland from this
sin and given us hope for the future. The green grass and flowers
that spring from their graves shows us how hope springs even from
death, tells us that all duty, love and courage, spring from the
graves of dead heroes.</P>
<P>Today, just two years after their deaths, we see a grand rally of
young lads in Ireland who are carrying on their work in the Fianna.
The courage of many of them has been tried in jail; many went out in
the flying columns taking their lives in their hands.</P>
<P>So today let us carry from these graves a message of hope to
Ireland. We will carry no bitterness for their murderers. We of the
Fianna still stand by the old chivalrous ideals of the Gael. We will
say, as our two martyrs would say, in the words of Christ, &ldquo;Father
forgive them, for they know not what they do.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The men who murdered these boys did not know what they did it for.
We pity them, we despise them &ndash; we abhor the qualities that
made them do such a deed, but we must not on an occasion like this
think of them bitterly.</P>
<P>The honouring of the two martyrs that lie here has today marked
another turning point, and we of the Fianna stand pledged to go out
and work and devote our lives to the full ratification of the Irish
Republic. That pledge we renew here today, and we in the names of the
dead heroes and martyrs, pray God to give us strength to act as they
did, and if needs be to fight as they did, and to die as they died,
in defence of the Republic of Ireland.</P>
