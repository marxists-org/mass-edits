<P class="fst">Written for Fianna &Eacute;ireann in her capacity as chief scout</P>
<P class="quoteb">&ldquo;A good citizen is a man or a woman every action of
whose life is based on the dictates of a strong Civic Conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<P class="fst">A baby when born into the world is like any other animal, in so
much as it is quite helpless and has no sense. As time passes, it
begins to notice and get in touch with other people; first with its
mother who cares for it, then with its little brothers and sisters,
its father and other members of the household. As it gets to
understand and be understood, it is forced to live in its family as
part of the family, suffering when the family suffers, mourning when
one of the family dies, going hungry when the breadwinner is idle,
and enjoying family life happily when all goes well with the
family.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Family Life The Beginning of Citizenship</H4>
<P class="fst">Some children learn quickly to live the common family life, and to
help and do their share in making the family life happy and
comfortable. Other children are selfish, wanting more than their
share of everything pleasant and shirking their share of work. Or
perhaps, they are given to telling tales on their brothers and
sisters; maybe they are untruthful or dishonest or prepared to push
all their brothers and sisters aside and into the gutter as long as
they get on.</P>
<P>This family life is the beginning of citizenship. It is
citizenship on a tiny scale, and the good citizen is the man or woman
who looks upon himself or herself as part of a big family that he
loves and wants to do his duty by. His big family is the whole
nation.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Joining the Fianna</H4>
<P class="fst">We begin life then as citizens of our family, but the first real
step in citizenship that we take is when we join the Fianna. We can
be good or bad members of the Fianna, just as we can be good or bad
members of our family or of our nation. It is that our brotherhood is
growing with our growth. We have already found new brethren in our
schoolmates, girls as well as boys, and now we find ourselves in a
still closer and deeper brotherhood within our nation. It is of
deeper significance for us, because we were not born into it as we
were into our family, nor were we sent there, as we were sent to
school. We joined the Fianna because we chose to of our own free
will. We made this choice because we wanted to work for Ireland, and
we wanted to take up the task of training ourselves. I say &ldquo;training
ourselves&rdquo; because we put ourselves voluntarily under our
officers, and accept their discipline and guidance.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Training the Young Citizen</H4>
<P class="fst">In the Fianna you learn to obey laws by obeying rules. You learn
how to govern and how to change laws by taking an interest in the
working of the organisation. You may not agree with all the rules,
but you will obey them and at the same time think over how you could
change them for the better, and discuss your ideas in your sluagh,
and later, if you are appointed a delegate at the Convention, you can
bring forward your suggestions as motions and discuss them there.</P>
<P>You elect delegates, too, just as later on you will be one of
those who elect TDs and councillors, and you will learn in the Fianna
to try and make up your mind who is the best man &ndash; that is, who
is the straightest and has the noblest ideals &ndash; and back him.
If you yourself are chosen to fill a position, you will learn to look
on it as a duty that you have been given, and not an empty honour.
You will learn, too, to stand down if you know you are not fitted for
a position, or if you feel that some other fellow is more fitted for
a position than you yourself are, for you will have learnt that you
are all brothers working for a glorious mother, Caitlin ni
h-Uallachain, and you are proud of having a noble, clever brother,
even cleverer than yourself, who will do great work, who will help
you and lead you on the road to make Ireland great. Each little lad
who drills beside you may have in him the making of a soul like Liam
Mellows, or Colbert or Heuston, or many another of our lads whose
memory is dear to us, and whose name will ive as long as Ireland
lives; not only for their noble deaths, but also for their noble,
unselfish lives. The honour of your organisation and the welfare of
your brother will become as dear to you as your own honour and
welfare, and as you grow, your love will include Ireland and your
fellow men.</P>
<P>And, after all, to be a good citizen is nothing more than to live
up to the command to love your neighbour as yourself. This sounds so
easy, and it is so hard. It is so hard not to grab all one can for
oneself, without caring who goes without; it is so easy just to shut
one&rsquo;s eyes and not to see how others suffer for one&rsquo;s
selfishness, and just to go on blindly taking what one considers to
be one&rsquo;s rights and enjoying oneself. But that is not good
citizenship, and it is this spirit of bad citizenship, of
competition, greed and selfishness that is at the bottom of
empire-building, and of the oppression of the weak by the strong the
world over. No men who loved their neighbour as themselves could
conspire together to conquer in their own greedy interests a weaker
neighbour and oppress them, as England conquered and oppressed
Ireland for centuries.</P>
<P>No-one who loved his neighbour as himself could bear to see people
living in squalor and misery, overworked and underfed, while others
are idle and have more money than they know how to spend.</P>
<P>This is wrong amongst brothers and sisters, and wrong in a nation.
It would not be possible in a land where people were trained to be
good citizens.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>The Duty of a Citizen</H4>
<P class="fst">If you understand this, when you come to be a man you will know
that your duty as a good citizen is to try and change all the tyranny
and misery you see around you. There is one weapon to your hand, your
vote, and it is your first duty on reaching the age of 21 to see that
your name is on the register. A careless bad citizen often neglects
to do this, and so cuts himself off from taking part in the
government of his country. You have been trained in the Fianna,
&ldquo;mentally and physically&rdquo;, to free Ireland and the people
of Ireland; let no opportunity be missed, no weapon be carelessly
left aside. The Fianna are the men of the future, who in their turn
will have the happiness of the nation in their hands. A good Fianna
boy who does his duty to his organisation and to his comrades will be
a good citizen.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Questions for Fianna Boys</H4>
<P class="fst">To conclude, I would like to ask you to set yourselves to learn
everything you can that you may help to serve your country. The way
to do this is to be very inquisitive. Ask yourself, before all, and
anyone who will listen to you, all these questions I am setting you,
and as many more as you can think of:</P>
<UL>
	<li>What is freedom?<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Why does Ireland want freedom?<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Why did England partition her?<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Why did the English make us speak English instead of our own
	language?<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Why do the people who work hardest have the smallest and most
	miserable homes?<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Why do the idlers have big houses and own great stretches of
	land?<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Is a country free when foreigners own all the big factories
	and business houses in it?</li>
</UL>
