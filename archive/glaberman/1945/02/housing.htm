<p class="fst">DETROIT &#8211; The Negro housing situation is still simmering in this
city. The most recent development was the attempt of the Detroit
Housing Commission to throw cold water into the pot to keep the
housing situation from boiling over.</p>

<p>On February 15 the Housing Commission approved a resolution
recommending the immediate construction of 1,000 Negro housing units
in the Oakwood section of Detroit. The previous day Charles F.
Edgecomb, secretary and director of the Housing Commission, had told
the City Council that the commission had no real solution to the
Negro housing problem &#8220;and is not likely to have one.&#8221; At the
same, time he said that the commission would recommend the
construction of 4,000 units in the Oakwood section.</p>

<p><em>Despite the fact that Edgecomb had told the Council that 4,000
units would not materially affect the 14,000 applications for Negro
housing now on file, the figure was finally cut to 1,000 units. The
14,000 applications are being increased by 600 every month.</em></p>

<p>This decision of the Housing Commission, which can only be
considered as a face-saving gesture, is just another episode in the
continual buck-passing that has attended the discussions of the
housing situation. Edgecomb had previously dumped the housing problem
into the lap of the City Council. The august city fathers immediately
dumped it right out again into the lap of Mayor Jeffries.</p>

<p>The Mayor was even quicker than the Council and passed it right
back. Now the Council has it right back where it started from &#8211; in
the Detroit Housing Commission. The net result of all this simulated
activity? One thousand units recommended.</p>

<p>The president of the City Council, John C. Lodge, remarked that
<em>&#8220;We will never solve the problem. At least there will be no
solution in our lifetime.&#8221;</em> If the Negroes of Detroit will wait
for a solution to the housing crisis from Lodge and his brother
politicians, they will find no solution &#8220;in their lifetime.&#8221; The
answer is to sweep these gentlemen out. They have had their
opportunity. They have had many long years to talk and to act. In all
those years the crisis only grew until today it threatens the social
and physical life of the city.</p>

<p><em>It remains only for the Negro people to unite with the labor
movement, the UAW-CIO, and challenge the control of these capitalist
politicians. It is time for the workers of Detroit to stop playing
around with Democratic and Republican politicians. Let the working
class try its hand at running the city.</em></p>
