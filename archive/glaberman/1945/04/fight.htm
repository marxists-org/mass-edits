<p class="fst">DETROIT &#8211; May Day 1945 marks a turning point for the Detroit
labor movement. For the UAW-CIO in Detroit, this May Day is V-E Day
and the immediate problem it faces is reconversion and mass unemployment.</p>

<p>During the years of war the primary object of the workers of
Detroit was to maintain their living standards and their union
against the dual onslaught of the auto corporations and the
government. To do this they had to fight the vicious regulations and
restrictions of the Roosevelt war government and the power of the
profit-swollen corporations.</p>

<p>They were aided in this fight by the serious shortage of labor for
war production, a shortage which labor could have used to excellent
advantage. This favorable strategic position, however, was more than
wiped out by the sell-out policies of the labor leadership &#8211; R.J.
Thomas, George Addes, Walter Reuther and Richard Frankensteen. The
struggle during the war years turned naturally, because of this,
against the leadership which voluntarily surrendered the right to
strike and accepted compulsory arbitration from an employer-packed
War Labor Board, the leadership which voluntarily retreated from the
most favorable bargaining position labor had ever held.</p>

<p><em>Out of this struggle was born a new rank and file leadership,
the UAW Rank &amp; File Committee, which organized and led the fight
for a militant and fighting UAW. It was this committee which pressed
for and won a membership referendum on the no-strike pledge and
rallied over thirty-five per cent of the vote against the pledge. It
was this committee which obviously reflected the interests and
desires of the rank and file of the union, a rank and file which
established a stirring record of strike action against the anti-union
offensive. There was hardly a day that one or more Detroit plants,
large or small, was not shut down by strike action.</em></p>

<p>This fighting spirit reached its peak in the recent Dodge and
Briggs strikes and the Kelsey-Hayes strike just ended which won
substantial concessions from the corporations and the WLB.</p>

<p>With the war in Europe reaching its end, however, a new and more
threatening enemy is faced by the auto workers. The Army has
announced that the contracts for the huge Willow Run bomber plant
will not be renewed. This means the dumping into the streets of over
21,000 workers from that plant alone. Affected in addition are
substantial numbers of workers on aircraft engines at the Ford
Highland Park and Rouge plants, and aircraft workers at Hudson,
Murray Body and Buick in Flint. The minimum layoff, in the Detroit
area from this one contract cancellation will surpass 50,000 workers.</p>

<p>Add to this the tens of thousands already laid off and the layoffs
to follow and a rough idea is presented of the seriousness of the
situation and the urgency of the problem.</p>

<p>The auto workers can take two roads in the coming period. They can
follow the timid, vacillating program of the UAW leadership &#8211; and
achieve nothing. Or they can for a bold, uncompromising program that
will meet their needs.</p>

<p>The minimum that is required in the present situation is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>An immediate reduction in working hours to thirty hours
per week with no reduction in weekly pay.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><em>A minimum annual guaranteed wage of $2,500 for each worker.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><em>All government owned plants that are not needed for war
production must be continued in operation with the production of
needed peacetime goods. These plants must remain government owned
and their management turned over to the union, which is the only
organization interested in the maintenance of peak production.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><em>All privately owned plants which shut down in whole or
in part must be taken over by the government and operated under
trade union control.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><em>Any deficits which arise out of such operation to be met
by taxation of current or previously accumulated war profits of the
big corporations.</em></li>
</ol>
