<p class="fst">DETROIT &#8211; The smear campaign against the rank and file auto
workers in Detroit in connection with the UAW-CIO no-strike pledge
referendum is going full blast. Every conceivable propaganda device
is being used to fool of scare the auto workers into voting to keep
their infamous pledge.</p>

<p>The arguments that are being used are, of course, not new. They
are a stale rehash of everything ever said by the labor-baiters in
industry, government and the labor movement. These arguments, from
&#8220;the boys in the foxholes&#8221; to &#8220;protect the UAW,&#8221; have been
reviewed in <strong>Labor Action</strong> many times and their essential
falseness exposed. What every auto worker should examine, whether he
has already voted in the referendum or not, is WHO is backing the
drive to keep the no-strike pledge.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Enemies</h4>

<p class="fst">Most obvious of all in the pro-pledge line-up is the reactionary
daily press. The <strong>Detroit News</strong> and the <strong>Detroit Free Press</strong>
have each featured two editorials attacking the rank and file
elements in the UAW who wish to see the pledge rescinded. The <strong>Free
Press</strong> reached the height of labor-baiting in a full dress
editorial and cartoon attacking Larry Yost, chairman of the National
Rank and File Steering Committee, spearhead of the movement to scrap
the pledge.</p>

<p><em>Screaming in impotent rage, the <strong>Free Press</strong> calls Yost
and the Rank and File Committee everything from demagogues and
hypocrites to lunatics. The real object of their hate is the Detroit
labor movement &#8211; the thousands upon thousands of workers who have
been forced to take strike action to protect themselves during the
war and their union brothers who have rallied to their defense.</em></p>

<p>The Detroit press &#8211; from the Hearst <strong>Detroit Times</strong> to the
self-appointed &#8220;liberal&#8221; <strong>Free Press</strong> &#8211; have consistently
been found in opposition to anything and everything that would
benefit labor. From their opposition to the CIO in the early days of
industrial unionism to their united support of Dewey and a labor
draft, the big business press has been sniping directly or indirectly
at the UAW and the things it stands for.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they have never failed to say a kind word for
the feudal-minded auto magnates. Ford, Kettering, Knudson, Sloan &#8211;
all the big and little dictators of industry, the bitterest enemies
of the workers of Detroit &#8211; receive nothing but praise in the kept press.</p>

<p>The record of the Detroit press is clear: <em>it is against
militant, fighting unionism. Therefore, it is FOR the no-strike pledge.</em></p>

<p>Lined up side by side with the big daily papers is the federal
government; lending its power and prestige to the campaign to keep
the pledge. The political representatives of big business know who
their masters are and act accordingly. Their record, too, is clear.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Government, Too</h4>

<p class="fst">The strike-breaking, anti-labor program of the government is
not as obvious today as it was in the days of the anti-labor
injunction and the use of troops to break strikes. But that is only
because the program has been modernized. Today the government goes in
for wage-freezing, job-freezing, a War Labor Board stacked against
labor, a Little Steel formula and the latest improvement &#8211; the
labor draft.</p>

<p>It is understandable, therefore, why the Roosevelt Administration
should want to keep labor&#8217;s straight-jacket, the no-strike pledge.
With a no-strike pledge, troops are no longer necessary to do the
dirty work of strike-breaking. R.J. Thomas, Phil Murray, Addes,
Reuther, Frankensteen &#8211; these are now the strike-breakers. It saves
the government a lot of money and directs the resentment of the rank
and file against their own leaders.</p>

<p><em>Why, then, this campaign of lies, sponsored and carried out by
the government? It has two purposes, both aimed at delivering what
they hope will be a death blow at the unions: One is to force through
a labor-draft bill. The other is to intimidate the workers into
keeping the no-strike pledge.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>No-Strike Diehards</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>In the UAW the Communists and their supporters are running the
show for the leadership in trying to get the pledge upheld. Stalinist
stooge W.G. Grant, president of Ford Local 600, is heading the
Committee to Uphold the No-Strike Pledge and every CPer in the UAW is
doing leg-work for him &#8211; not least of all Nat Ganley, business
agent of Local 155, who is spewing forth in the columns of the <strong>Daily
Worker</strong> about how everyone who strikes or wants to rescind
the no-strike pledge is nothing less than a Trotskyite, a Norman
Thomasite and a Hitlerite all rolled into one.</em></p>

<p>The pro-pledge gang began to smell so bad that Walter Reuther, UAW
vice-president and strong supporter of the pledge, was forced to
refuse an honorary post on Grant committee on the grounds that it was
controlled by the Communists.</p>

<p>The allies of the UAW top leaders in their fight to keep the
no-strike pledge are powerful and unscrupulous. But their very power
will prove to be their undoing. An auto worker has only to look them
over to see that he belongs on the other side of the fence. They are
not fit company for anyone who calls himself a labor leader and still
less for a worker. Their money, their power, their radios and
newspapers are all additional arguments for voting to scrap the
no-strike pledge.</p>
