<p class="fst">DETROIT &#8211; Following on the heels of the reactionary decision of
the Dearborn city administration to exclude a Negro housing project
from that city comes another slap in the face of the Negro citizens
of the Detroit area. This time it is his lordship, Mayor Jeffries,
and the Detroit city council who completely reveal the inability of
the politicians to offer any sort of decent solution to a housing
problem that has been plaguing this city since before the war.</p>

<p><em>Back in May of 1943, the Detroit City Council, pressed with
demands for expanding the housing facilities available to Negroes,
turned a deaf ear to all proposals and ruled that any new housing
must not change the existing racial composition of neighborhoods.
Reduced to cold facts this decision meant &#8211; no new Negro housing.
There was no room for expansion in the already tragically overcrowded
sections where Negroes are segregated in Detroit.</em></p>

<p>Since that time, of course, the housing situation has become
increasingly intolerable. Hardest hit, as always, are the Negroes.
Figures from the War Manpower commission and the U.S. census Bureau
reveal that there has been an increase in the Negro population of
62,000 in 1944. At the same time the white population decreased by
82,000. These figures, unfortunately, do not reveal the results in
terms of overcrowding, disease, juvenile delinquency and the other
ills that find a fruitful breeding place in rundown tenements and
unpainted shacks.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Political Buck Passing</h4>

<p class="fst">The situation finally reached a stage where it seemed that action
could be delayed no longer. But this was not reckoning with.
Detroit&#8217;s two-bit politicians. Blundering as they are, they are
past masters of the art of delay and deception. It started with the
Detroit Housing Commission which, presumably, is responsible for such
things as seeing to it that adequate housing is available. The
director-secretary of the commission, Charles F. Edgecomb, announced
publicly that new neighborhoods would have to be opened up to Negro
housing to meet the problem.</p>

<p>Did this mean that the Housing commission would finally DO
something? Heaven forbid! This was merely a recommendation, you see.</p>

<p><em>Did the Housing Commission have the power to act on its
recommendation? Of course it did. But action which would in any way
improve the conditions of the Negroes living in Detroit (and might,
incidentally, antagonize the powerful real estate interests) is what
the august commission is least interested in. Why, in a couple of
years the war might end and with it the problem of providing homes
for the workers in Detroit&#8217;s armament factories. And in the
meantime? In the meantime we&#8217;ll pass the buck to the City Council.</em></p>

<p>The Council, which is best known as a home for worn-out athletes,
was not at all pleased with this decision. Polled by the press on
their reactions to this new proposal on Negro housing, the eminent
councilmen waxed eloquent with such comments as: &#8220;Well, er, you see
...&#8221; &#8220;This, matter deserves careful consideration ...&#8221; &#8220;We
will study this recommendation closely ...&#8221; One courageous lawmaker
is even rumored to have gone so far as to say: &#8220;When we have
reached a decision, we must act on it.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Mayor and the Athletes</h4>

<p class="fst">Crowning this statesmanlike discussion was the decision to wait
until the Mayor made a recommendation. <em>The ex-football players on
the Council remembered enough about passing to know what to do with
the buck that was passed to them?</em></p>

<p>Everyone waited for the Mayor&#8217;s decision. Mayor Jeffries is one
who does not shirk responsibility nor hesitate to take a firm stand.
His firmness, however, seems, invariably, to be directed AGAINST
Negroes. The last time Jeffries was firm was in backing ex-Prosecutor
Dowling in his ruthless anti-Negro campaign during and after the
Detroit race riots. This time the lion suddenly turned into a lamb.</p>

<p><em>The Mayor failed to appear at the Council meeting at which he
was to present his recommendations. Instead he sent a letter. He bad
no recommendation on the Housing Commission proposals, he told the
Council. He suggested &#8211; further discussion! He proposed that the
subject be discussed by representatives of the Housing Commission,
the Mayor&#8217;s Interracial Committee (a body set up to cover Jeffries&#8217;
vicious role in the riots), the Council and Jeffries himself.</em></p>

<p>The final scene in this farce is the short line in the newspapers:
<em>&#8220;No date was suggested for the discussion.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>In this swamp of double-talk and double-dealing only one thing
stands out clearly. Jeffries and his dirty crew of peanut politicians
do not intend to lift a finger for decent Negro housing &#8211; or decent
housing for anyone. Decent housing means modern homes, means air and
light, means rents that fit a worker&#8217;s paycheck. Looked at through
the insane mirror of capitalism, decent housing means smaller profits
for the landlord? The two are incompatible.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A Way Out</h4>

<p class="fst">There are also two ways to fight for adequate housing. There is
the landlords&#8217; way, the politicians&#8217; way. This is based first and
foremost on the sacred right of private property. This is the way of
endless discussions, of buck-passing, of begging. This is the
crawling, segregated, Jim Crow way.</p>

<p>And there is the workers&#8217; way. This is based on need and on the
proven ability of the country&#8217;s industry to provide ample housing
for everyone. This is the way of workers&#8217; action, of a militant
struggle for the right of workers to control the kind of homes they
live in. It is in the interest of all workers to provide modern homes
for ALL and, by ending the competition for living space between black
and white, root out Jim Crow and segregation.</p>

<p>Does anyone have more right to ample housing that the workers who
produce all that is built?</p>

<p>Is anyone better able to fight for such a program than the labor
movement, uniting Negro and white?</p>
