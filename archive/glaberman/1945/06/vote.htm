<p class="fst">DETROIT &#8211; The mass pressure of the rank and file auto and
aircraft workers for militant action to meet the growing problem of
unemployment and cutbacks was reflected in a call for a national
UAW-CIO strike vote to enforce the union&#8217;s demands. The call was
contained in a resolution carried by a three-to-one vote at a Detroit
regional conference composed of the four top officers of all UAW
locals in the area.</p>

<p><em>The conference was held at the insistence of local UAW
presidents who were tired of the inaction of the International
Executive Board and top officers of the union in the face of mass
layoffs and pay cuts. At a meeting the day before the conference the
local presidents demanded an end to all manpower restrictions, a
thirty-hour week and, as the first step in that direction, the
forty-hour week with forty-eight hours&#8217; pay. As the means to carry
out these demands, they called for a national strike vote under the
Smith-Connally Act.</em></p>

<p>These proposals were presented to the conference the following
day, representing 400,000 UAW members, by a steering committee headed
by Brendon Sexton, president of Local 50, and Matthew Hammond,
president of Local 157.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Thomas Empty-Handed</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>UAW President R.J. Thomas, who admitted that he returned from
Washington empty-handed and that no one in the government had any
idea of what to do about reconversion unemployment, pleaded with the
delegates not to ask for strike action. He called those who favored
strike action &#8220;rabble-rousers&#8221; but could offer no program at all
which would protect the workers from unemployment and lower wages.
The complete failure of Thomas&#8217;s policy of running after government
officials and industrialists, such as Henry J. Kaiser, and begging
them to do something was so obvious from Thomas&#8217; own remarks that
they only served to sharpen the demand for militant union action.</em></p>

<p>Richard T. Leonard, regional director, who presided over the
conference, attempted in his usual blundering, bureaucratic way to
prevent discussion of the strike question. He ruled the minority
report of the resolutions committee out of order on the ground that
it violated the UAW constitution ... Hammond thereupon introduced the
demand for a strike vote as an amendment to the majority report. This
was also ruled out of order by Leonard amid the boos and catcalls of
the delegates. Leonard&#8217;s ruling was appealed from the floor and in
the vote he was overwhelmingly defeated.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Strike Vote Carries</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>The strike vote amendment was then carried, three to one. It
was an indication of the disgust of the membership with the so-called
labor statesmanship of the union bureaucrats, which consists in
hanging around the servants&#8217; entrance of the White House, waiting
for crumbs to be tossed out. The conference, unfortunately, does not
have the power to institute the strike vote itself. The resolution
was in the form of a demand upon the Executive Board which the board
will undoubtedly try to ignore or water down beyond recognition.</em></p>

<p>The chief danger is that the proposals of Vice-President Walter
Reuther will be accepted in order to sidetrack the militancy apd
fighting spirit of the union. Reuther, who is the UAW expert in
emasculating fighting proposals, is calling for the rescinding of the
no-strike pledge only in plants that are reconverted to peacetime production.</p>

<p>This means, of course, that strike action is prevented until <em>after</em>
reconversion has taken place and is prevented even then if one
machine in the plant is producing some inconsequential item for the
war with Japan.</p>

<p>The need is for strike action NOW when the workers&#8217; living
standards and the unions are being most bitterly attacked.</p>

<p><em>Progressives in the UAW must take care, however, that they
don&#8217;t jump from one extreme to the other on the question of
political action. The completely justified resentment against the
alliance between Thomas, Addes and Reuther and the capitalist
politicians in the government and in the Democratic Party can result
in a movement away from any kind of political action and toward
purely union action and wage and hour demands.</em></p>

<p>Militant union action is essential but it is not enough. The
problem of unemployment and reconversion can be lessened by the
thirty-hour week and increased wages, but it cannot be solved without
nation-wide planning by the government in the interest of the
workers. This in turn requires the most active intervention of the
workers and their organizations in the field of government and
politics, but intervention as as independent class force, not as the
tail to the Democratic Party.</p>

<p><em>To the capitalist politics of R.J. Thomas there must be opposed
not &#8220;no politics&#8221; but workers&#8217; politics, the political
organization of the working class.</em></p>
