<h1>Employment in Detroit Area<br/>
Decreased by 107,000 Workers</h1>

<p class="info">From <strong>Labor Action</strong>, <a href="../../../../history/etol/newspape/laboraction-ny/1945/index.htm#la09_19" target="new">Vol.&nbsp;9 No.&nbsp;19</a>, 7 May 1945, pp.&nbsp;1 &amp;&nbsp;3.<br />

<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">DETROIT &#8211; Accompanying an announcement by the Army that the huge
Willow Run Bomber plant is to be shut down by mid-summer upon
completion of current contracts, a re-port was issued by the Michigan
War Manpower Commission that in the year ending March 31 employment
in war plants in the Detroit area decreased 107,000.</p>

<p>This report has a double significance &#8211; for the past and for the
future. It points out the deliberate falsehood of the attacks on
militant unionists by government officials, corporation executives
and the UAW-CIO top leadership. In their campaign to weaken the
unions and keep the no-strike pledge they shouted constantly about
production needs at the same time that, workers were being laid off
in every auto plant.</p>

<p>But the lesson for the future is even more serious. The crucial
problem of reconversion and post-war unemployment can be put off no
longer. It is here now. The State WMC director, Edward L. Cushman,
tried to pretty up the picture of 107,000 fewer jobs by insisting
that only 35,000 were unemployed. 35,000 unemployed, of course, is a
fact which only a WMC director can brush aside with a casual remark.
To those who are out of work in a time of fantastically high prices,
the problem demands an immediate solution.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Labor Officials &#8220;Fight&#8221;</h4>

<p class="fst">But what of the rest whose jobs have disappeared? Have they
retired on their &#8220;fabulous earnings?&#8221; Have they vanished into
thin air? Not at all. They are all here, big as life, and working &#8211;
BUT, they are working on worked-out farms which they left a couple of
years ago to make a more decent living at union wages or they are
working in the low-paid non-war industries such as restaurants,
laundries and the like. Those few who are not working at all have
given up the search for a decent job and are forced to make a go of
it on the wages of another member of the family.</p>

<p>In other words, 35,000 Detroit workers have lost their income
altogether and 72,000 workers have had their living standards reduced.</p>

<p>For Detroit, this is only the beginning. In the next few months
these figures will be doubled, tripled and quadrupled.</p>

<p>With this immediate threat against the welfare of the auto and
aircraft workers the leadership of the UAW-CIO was galvanized into
action. To be specific, two kinds of &#8220;action.&#8221; First they poured
their hearts out &#8211; in words, which are cheap &#8211; about the sad
plight of the auto worker during reconversion and how the government,
the wonderful New Deal government (the same government which ordered
Willow Run shut down), ought to do something about it. When they used
up their words, they acted again--this time with results.</p>

<p>They figured out that fewer jobs means fewer union members and
less dues. So they clapped extra assessment on the membership so
that, no matter what happened to the auto workers, the payrolls of
the union could still be padded with porkchoppers whose main function
is to keep in power the two cliques which run the union.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether they can get away with this. The
rank and file of the union, through its spokesmen, the Rank and File
Committee, should demand a realistic, fighting program for
reconversion. And they must demand that this program be fought for &#8211;
not begged for at the servant&#8217;s entrance to the White House.</p>

<p>The barest minimum to take care of the needs of the workers is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>A guaranteed annual wage of $2,500 for each worker. Let
the corporations pay for any idleness which they force upon the workers.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><em>Any plant which private industry cannot operate at full
production for peace time goods must be taken over by the government
and operated under trade union control.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><em>The government-owned plants must not be parcelled out to
private industry to do with as they please. They must remain
government owned and operated at full production under trade union control.</em></li>
</ul>
