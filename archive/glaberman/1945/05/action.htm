<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">DETROIT &#8211; At a special mass meeting of workers at the Ford Rouge
plant the membership of Local 600, UAW-CIO, scotched the attempts of
their local and international leadership to talk away the layoffs and
cutbacks that are taking place and voted unanimously in favor of
rescinding the no-strike pledge and calling a National Labor Holiday.</p>

<p>The meeting, held on Saturday afternoon, May 5, had been called by
Local President W.G. Grant, leading member of the
Communist-controlled clique that had just suffered a severe setback
in the local&#8217;s primary elections. It was advertised as a meeting to
protest the recent announcements of further layoffs and cutbacks at
the Rouge and other Ford plants and the wage cuts resulting from a
reduction to a forty-hour week.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Local Leaders Stall</h4>

<p class="fst">In reality, Grant and his cohorts had two purposes in calling the
meeting. One was to increase his chances of re-election in the
local&#8217;s runoff election which will be held soon. Grant had come out
second best in the primaries, running after a Reuther supporter, J.
McCusker. Shelton Tappes, recording secretary, and other Communist
Party stalwarts had been defeated in the primaries. A meeting of this
kind looked like a good opportunity to revive the wan-ing popularity
of their sell-out administration.</p>

<p><em>Their second purpose in calling the meeting was to forestall
any militant struggle against layoffs and unemployment by big talk
and little action. For this purpose, International President R.J.
Thomas, Ford Director Richard T. Leonard and Carsten Tiedeman,
Detroit chairman for the War Production Board, were presented as
speakers. The whole tenor of their remarks was that unemployment and
wage cuts could only be prevented by the kindness and good nature of
the government and private industry in providing jobs. The fact that
it was this same government, allied with private industry, that was
announcing cutback after cutback just as soon as production could no
longer yield profits to industry, that it was this government which
was completely ignoring the needs and welfare of the workers during
the reconversion period and after, did not seem to teach these people
anything.</em></p>

<p>It was clear, however, that the membership of the local understood
that only a militant fight against the corporations and the
government would get them anywhere. Over 4,000 members packed the
hall, with 3,000 more having to be turned away. They waited patiently
throughout the meeting for some indication that their leadership was
prepared to put up a struggle in their behalf but got none.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Rank and File Acts</h4>

<p class="fst">Toward the end of the meeting, Larry Yost, chairman of the
aircraft unit at the Rouge plant and national chairman of the Rank
and File Steering Committee, introduced a fighting resolution on the
Little Steel formula. It resolved:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;That this meeting of Ford Local 600 calls upon the
Congress of the United States to abandon the Little Steel formula and
the area bracket system which have served to undermine the real
earnings of war workers,</em></p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;2. That a realistic reconversion wage policy be
instituted without delay, which will</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoteb"><em>(a) Maintain immediately the present levels of weekly
take-home pay as hours of work are reduced from forty-eight to forty
hours per week, without sacrificing in one iota our three-year fight
to overcome the unfairness of the differential that already had
existed between wages and cost of living while we were yet on a
forty-eight hour week.</em></p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>(b) Allow for industry-wide equal pay for equal work
in place of the vicious area bracket system ...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;Be it finally resolved that unless immediate steps
are made to meet these demands, that this assemblage favors immediate
revocation of our union no-strike pledge and the calling of a
National Labor Holiday.&#8221;</em></p>

<p class="fst">This resolution threw the leadership into consternation. This was
not what they had planned. They had wanted the meeting limited to
long-winded speeches and cut-and-dried resolutions with no discussion
from the floor. When the resolution was put to a vote, however, it
was passed unanimously. Its passage was greeted by the membership
with a huge ovation.</p>

<p><em>Grant sheepishly remarked after the vote that this was not the
resolution that the membership had intended to pass. But he was
immediately answered with loud cries of &#8220;Oh, yes we did!&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Once again the Ford workers have shown the way. They have
demonstrated the only way in which labor&#8217;s program for jobs and
security can be won &#8211; through militant, determined struggle.</p>
