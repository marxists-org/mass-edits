<p class="fst"><strong>DETROIT</strong> &#8211; <em>The tense labor situation here, resulting
from on unceasing anti-union campaign by management, exploded with
two major strikes against the Chrysler and Briggs Body corporations
by UAW-CIO members.</em></p>

<p><em>The Chrysler strike, which began at the Dodge main plant of the
company, ended with a partial victory for the union. The Briggs
strike is still continuing at the time of this writing.</em></p>

<p><em>The 13,500 members of Dodge Local 3 walked out an Friday,
February 23, in protest against the company's discharge of eight men
for their failure to meet a production speed-up. They returned to
work on Monday, March 5, with the fallowing results:</em></p>

<p class="fst"><em><strong>Gained:</strong></em></p>

<ol>
<li>They forced the National War Labor Board to act on the
issues before the strike was ended, which the WLB has always
insisted they would not do.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Their militant and united action, plus the lesson that was
learned during similar strikes at Chrysler Highland Park and
Chevrolet Gear and Axle here recently, forestalled any disciplinary
action by the international union.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The raised production schedule will not be introduced until
after it has been arbitrated by the umpire under the Chrysler-UAW contract.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst"><em><strong>Lost:</strong></em></p>

<ol>
<li>The local retreated from its position on the key issue of
whether the men would be reinstated before the termination of the
strike. Their reinstatement is also referred to the umpire for
future settlement.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">The Dodge walkout, which was supported by the inter-plant drivers
of the company, resulted in the shutting down of the Dodge truck
plant with 3,000 workers, the Chrysler Windsor plant with 1,500
workers, and the partial stoppage of the Chrysler tank arsenal, the
Highland Park and other plants. The DeSoto-Warren plant walked out in
support of the strike because they refused to work on parts delivered
by non-UAW members.</p>

<p>The Briggs strike was also the result of planned company
provocation to break the union. It began on March 1 when the company
discharged seven minor union officers for allegedly &#8220;instigating&#8221;
a recent strike. In addition, four to seven more were discharged for
participating in the current strike.</p>

<p>The beginning of the Dodge strike let loose a vicious barrage of
anti-union propaganda and intimidation by the reactionary daily
press, the bureaucrats at the head of the UAW, the corporations, the
WLB and the Communist Party. The papers went wild at the idea that
workers were striking to defend their rights arid their union. They
spewed out charges of &#8220;near treason,&#8221; hurting the war effort and
demanded that &#8216;the draft boards reclassify and induct into the army
striking unionists.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Strike-Breaker Addes</h4>

<p class="fst">George F. Addes, acting president of the UAW, headed the slander
campaign of the bureaucrats. Despite the fact that he had to admit
the justification of the union&#8217;s case, he demanded in his best
strike-breaking manner that the men go back to work without a
settlement of their just grievances. At a meeting of the Dodge
workers on February 27, Addes and Norman Matthews, Chrysler director
of the union, were vigorously booed for their anti-union stand and
their attacks on Mike Novak, president of Local 3, and the local
officers who supported the membership in their demands.</p>

<p>Addes attempted to justify his stand by claiming that the February
27 meeting was unrepresentative and was dominated by &#8220;hot-heads.&#8221;
After the meeting Addes announced that the international was
withdrawing all support from Local 3. He was reported to have said
that <em>&#8220;they are on their own now. The international union will
not help them to get discharged workers reinstated and will not aid
the local if more strikers are dismissed by the company.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>This statement was both a lie and a threat. It was a lie because
the international union never lifted a finger to help the Dodge
workers. They did their best to prevent a victorious settlement of
the Dodge grievances. In other words, there was no aid they could
have withdrawn.</p>

<p>It was a threat because it was an open invitation to the Chrysler
Corporation to fire militant workers at their pleasure.</p>

<p>Addes&#8217; charge that the local meeting was not representative of
the men was also shown to be a lie when a later meeting, held on
March 1 and attended by 2,200 members of the local, voted
overwhelmingly to stay out until the men were reinstated. The
combined efforts of Addes, Vice-Presidents Walter Reuther and Richard
Frankensteen and Chrysler Director Matthews to sell out the workers
proved unavailing.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Company Provocation</h4>

<p class="fst">The extent of the betrayal by Addes and his fellow bureaucrats is
shown by their own admission of the bitter anti-union drive of the
corporations. Frankensteen charged before the WLB hearing in
Washington that the Chrysler Corporation was out to break the union.
<em>&#8220;Detroit employers,&#8221;</em> he said, <em>&#8220;are deliberately
seeking the creation of industrial unrest and work stoppages. The
object appears to be to gain public hatred toward the whole
institution of collective bargaining and, specifically, to destroy
the UAW-CIO.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Frankensteen charged, in addition, that Chrysler has spent
thousands of dollars for labor spies in preparation for the post-war
period and referred to a speech made by John W. Scoville, a Chrysler
spokesman, in which Scoville demanded an end to all collective bargaining.</p>

<p><em>This, of course, is not news to Chrysler workers. This
union-busting offensive has been going on for a long time and the
object is not to break the union after the. war but NOW, if it is at
all possible. Frankensteen and his brother misleaders have known
about this too but have not done anything about it. When the Dodge
workers take concrete action against this very anti-labor offensive
all Frankensteen can think of is to demand an investigation! In the
meantime, he and Addes and Reuther sell out the strike.</em></p>

<p>Franksteen, however, did make one excellent suggestion &#8211;
although this also came a little late. He demanded that in the future
no workers be fired until AFTER the case has gone through the
grievance procedure. This should be adopted throughout the UAW and
the labor movement. It is obvious that if workers who are fired have
to remain out of work for many months, sometimes a year or more,
before their grievances are settled &#8211; and they are usually settled
unfavorably by the WLB &#8211; they have no real protection from the
bargaining procedure. Often the company has achieved its objective
even if the worker is reinstated because he has been out of the plant
for so long. Militant workers who are candidates for union office
have been fired on trumped-up charges only so they will not be
eligible for election. It is time the unions put a stop to this
procedure and provide a real defense for militant stewards, rank and
filers and local officers.</p>

<p>Frankensteen, however, did not make this proposal because of any
concern over defending the rights of auto workers. He made it purely
to cover up his own strike-breaking activities during the Dodge and
Briggs walkouts. You can be sure that once these walkouts are settled
he will conveniently forget the whole thing. The rank and file of the
union must not let him forget.</p>

<p>The role of the top UAW leaders in this situation points again to
the fact that they are concerned essentially not with defending the
membership of their union but with supporting their boss, Franklin
&#8220;Slave Labor Law&#8221; Roosevelt. To support Roosevelt, the political
representative of the corporations, it is only natural that the labor
leaders will appease the corporations. Any genuine fight against the
corporations &#8220;embarrasses&#8221; Roosevelt. And since the last thing
in the world these misleaders want to see is Roosevelt embarrassed,
they lash out bitterly against their rank and file, which is
concerned not with any embarrassment of Roosevelt but with their own
&#8220;embarrassment,&#8221; that is, the rising cost of living.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>FDR&#8217;s WLB</h4>

<p class="fst">What Roosevelt has done for the workers was indicated at the
hearings before the WLB in Washington. When Frankensteen pointed to
the union-busting speech of Chrysler's John W. Scoville, William H.
Davis, Roosevelt's representative at the head of the WLB, could only
say that the speech was out of place and that Scoville ought to keep
his mouth shut!</p>

<p>Did he oppose Chrysler&#8217;s open attacks on the union? Not at all.
They can break the union all they want provided they don&#8217;t talk
about it in public. That, you see, makes it a little harder for Davis
and the other Roosevelt bureaucrats to seem impartial when they sell
labor down the river.</p>

<p>when Mike Novak appeared before the WLB, Davis angrily told him to
<em>&#8220;Get this clear. You&#8217;re calling your union together, and
you&#8217;re telling the members to return to work Monday.&#8221;</em> When
Novak accepts the majority decision of his membership and supports
their grievance &#8211; that makes Davis angry, when Scoville announces
that Chrysler wants to break the union &#8211; Davis meekly calls that
&#8220;out of place.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Workers More Militant</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>That more and more workers are beginning to realize that the
top union leadership represents not them but the Roosevelt
government, the government of America&#8217;s Sixty Families, is
indicated by the action taken by the Briggs strikers, led by their
past president, Jess Ferrazza. Three hundred of them picketed the
international office of the UAW at the same time that they were
picketing the Briggs plants. They carried slogans such as &#8220;One
Homer Martin Is Enough&#8221; and &#8220;Let an Administrator Take Over the
International.&#8221; The last slogan referred to the dictatorial
practice of the international of taking over militant locals and
trying to hatchet the progressive members by appointing an
administration hatchet man over the local.</em></p>

<p>Ferrazza also proposed the organization of all stewards and
committeemen in Detroit shops to act on such questions as speed-up
and firing of unionists. This proposal is discussed elsewhere in this issue.</p>

<p>The Briggs workers understood that to settle their grievances and
protect their union they faced not only the corporations and the
government but also the sell-out leadership of their union. Thereby
is indicated the road that progressive UAW members must follow to
take the union out of the hands of the Thomases, the Addeses, the
Frankensteens and the Reuthers. They must join with the Rank and File
Committee of the union and unite against the two old power caucuses
around the Rank and File program:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Rescind the no-strike pledge.</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Break the WLB by getting the labor members off the board.</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Smash the Little Steel formula.</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Build a Labor Party.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">The fact that the Chrysler workers have walked back does not end
the problem. The demands of the Briggs strikers have not yet been
met. And reprisals against the Chrysler workers and Briggs workers
are possible. The WLB promised that no Dodge workers would be fired
as a result of the strike but it is a weasel-worded promise which
does not include other Chrysler plants. Action against President Mike
Novak has been threatened by the international.</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>UAW workers: remain on guard.</strong></p>

<p class="fst"><strong>Organize to defeat the anti-union offensive of the corporations
and the sell-out policies of the international leadership.</strong></p>
