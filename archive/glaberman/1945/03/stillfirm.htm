<p class="fst">DETROIT &#8211; The Dodge main plant of the Chrysler Corporation was
shut down by a strike of the more than 17,000 workers which began on
Feb. 23. The strikers, members of Local 3, UAW-CIO, were protesting
an attempt of the company to reintroduce the vicious speed-up for
which Detroit was noted before the advent of the UAW.</p>

<p>The Chrysler Corporation had attempted to raise the production
rate in the gear department from 108 to 184 pieces per hour. The
workers were unable to meet this rate, and eight employees, including
one with twenty years&#8217; seniority, were fired. The walkout was the result.</p>

<p>George F. Addes, acting president of the UAW, immediately entered
the picture in his usual role of strike-breaker. Knowing that his
words would not affect he results of the recently concluded no-strike
pledge referendum, Addes &#8220;ordered&#8221; the Dodge workers back to work
and threatened &#8220;immediate action on the part of the executive board
of the union&#8221; if the workers failed to heed his dictatorial edict.</p>

<p>In contrast to the position of Addes and the international, Mike
Novak, president of the Dodge Local, announced that the local
executive board was in full sympathy with the striking workers. At a
membership meeting held on Sunday, February 25, to consider going
back to work, the local voted overwhelmingly to stay out and called
out the 600 maintenance men and tool and die workers to add support
to the strike.</p>

<p><em>At this meeting, at which Norman Matthews, Chrysler director of
the UAW, represented the International Union, all references to
himself and George Addes were heartily booed. The same fate was
suffered by the one or two proposals that were made to compromise the
issue with the company. The membership was for staying out until
their point was won.</em></p>

<p>In this they had the support of the workers in most of the
thirteen Chrysler plants in the Detroit area, all of whom have been
victims in recent months of company attempts to speed up production
in preparation for auto production. The addition of the interplant
drivers to the ranks of the strikers made a further spread of the
strike seem likely.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say at this writing what action the
International Union and the War Labor Board will take. In past
situations of this kind the international has suspended local
executive boards for backing up the membership. However, in every
case of this kind the international was repudiated and the local
board upheld by being voted back into office by overwhelming votes of
the membership.</p>

<p>The usual government action, if the strike lasts for some time, is
to &#8220;seize&#8221; the plant. Local President Novak has already asked
that the government take over the plant. The danger to the workers in
this is that any nominal seizure by the government will be to PREVENT
settlement of the grievance. <em>The workers must not accept federal
seizure of the plant as a substitute for the elimination of the
speed-up; and the reinstatement of the fired workers.</em></p>
