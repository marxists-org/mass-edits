<p class="fst"><strong>The Philosophy of Hegel</strong><br />
G.R.G. Mure<br />
<em>Oxford, 12s 6d</em></p>

<p class="fst">Lenin wrote in his philosophical notebooks: &#8216;It is impossible completely to understand Marx&#8217;s <strong>Capital</strong>, and especially its first chapter, without having thoroughly studied and understood the <em>whole</em> of Hegel&#8217;s <strong>Logic</strong>, Consequently, half a century later none of the Marxists understood Marx!!&#8217; Another half a century later the situation is not one bit improved. That would be reason enough for socialists to welcome a good introduction to a difficult philosopher. An added concern is that dialectical materialism has been left as a monopoly of the Stalinists; which is to say that it has become rigid, formalistic, dogmatic, in snort: undialectical idealism. It is a pity that this little book by Mure does not fill the need. It is possible that 207 pages is simply too small a space in which to do justice to the totality of Hegel&#8217;s system. But the limitations of space are joined by limitations of conception. Mure&#8217;s views are much too old-fashioned and too technically &#8216;philosophical&#8217; to bring Hegel to life for a modern reader. In both of these respects, J.N. Findlay&#8217;s book, <strong>Hegel: a Re-examination</strong>, is considerably better (and is available in paperback).</p>

<p>Lenin could say of Hegel&#8217;s <strong>Science of Logic</strong>, &#8216;in this most idealistic of Hegel&#8217;s works there is the <em>least</em> idealism and the <em>most materialism</em>. &#8220;Contradictory,&#8221; but a fact&#8217;! Findlay recognises the sense of this in his statement that there is &#8216;as much materialism in Hegel as in Marx ...&#8217; Such conceptions, however, have great difficulty forcing their way past Mure&#8217;s concern with Spirit and spirituality.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that Marx stood Hegel on his head. This has served for too long as an excuse to ignore Hegel. Mure makes that excuse too easy to accept. A far better road to Hegel would be through Findlay, through Herbert Marcuse&#8217;s <strong>Reason and Revolution</strong>, and through Lenin&#8217;s <strong>Philosophical Notebooks</strong>, now available in English &#8211; all, of course, as prelude to the master who gave to Marx his method.</p>
