<p class="information">Ida Mett's history of the Kronstadt uprising 1921 highlights 
one of the most important yet neglected events of the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p class="information">The suppression of the most revolutionary section of the 
Navy by the Bolsheviks was the final blow to any hope of a genuine revolution 
based on democratic workers' control. Mett dispels many of the contemporary 
mistruths put forward by Bolshevik propagandists and includes a number of 
original sources from the commune.</p>

<h2><a name="h2">Introduction to the French Edition</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The time seems ripe for us to seek a better understanding of 
Kronstadt, although no new facts have emerged since 1921. The archives of the 
Russian Government and of the Red Army remain closed to any kind of objective 
analysis. However statements in some official publications seem to reflect some 
of these events, albeit in a distorted light. But what was known at the time was 
already sufficient to allow one to grasp the political significance of this 
symptomatic and crucial episode of the Russian Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">Working class militants in the West had absolute confidence in 
the Bolshevik Government. This government had just headed an immense effort of 
the working class in its struggle against feudal and bourgeois reaction. In the 
eyes of these workers it incarnated the Revolution itself.</p>

<p class="fst">People could just not believe that this same government could 
have cruelly put down a revolutionary insurrection. That is why it was easy for 
the Bolsheviks to label the (Kronstadt) movement as a reactionary one and to 
denounce it as organized and supported by the Russian and European bourgeoisies.</p>

<p class="fst">"An insurrection of White generals, with ex-general Kazlovski at 
its head" proclaimed the papers at the time. Meanwhile the Kronstadt sailors 
were broadcasting the following appeal to the whole world:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Comrade workers, red soldiers and sailors. We are for the 
power of the Soviets and not that of the parties. We are for free representation 
of all who toil. Comrades, you are being misled. At Kronstadt all power is in 
the hands of revolutionary sailors, of red soldiers and of workers. It is not in 
the hands of White Guards, allegedly headed by a general Kozlovski, as Moscow 
Radio tells you."</p>

<p class="fst">Such were the conflicting interpretations of the Kronstadt 
sailors and of the Kremlin Government. As we wish to serve the vital interests 
of the working class by an objective analysis of historical events, we propose 
to examine these contradictory theses, in the light of facts and documents, and 
of the events that almost immediately followed the crushing of Kronstadt.</p>

<p class="fst">"The workers of the world will judge us" said the Kronstaders in 
their broadcast.</p>

<p class="fst">"The blood of the innocents will fall on the heads of those who 
have become drunk with power." Was it a prophecy?</p>

<p class="fst">Here is a list of prominent communists having played an active 
part in the suppression of the insurrection. Readers will see their fate:</p>

the implacable struggle against both strikers and sailors. <i>SHOT.</i></p>

<h3><a name="h4">1. Background to the Kronstadt insurrection</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The Kronstadt insurrection broke out three months after the 
conclusion of the civil war on the European front.</p>

<p class="fst">As the Civil War drew to a victorious end the working masses of 
Russia were in a state of chronic famine. They were also increasingly dominated 
by a ruthless regime, ruled by a single party. The generation which had made 
October still remembered the promise of the social revolution and the hopes they 
had of building a new kind of society.</p>

<p class="fst">This generation had comprised a very remarkable section of the 
working class. It had reluctantly abandoned its demands for equality and for 
real freedom, believing them to be, if not incompatible with war, at least 
difficult to achieve under wartime conditions. But once victory was assured, the 
workers in the towns, the sailors, the Red Army men, and the peasants, all those 
who had shed their blood during the Civil War, could see no further 
justification for their hardships and for blind submission to a ferocious 
discipline. Even if these might have had some reason in wartime, such reasons no 
longer applied.</p>

<p class="fst">While many had been fighting at the front, others&#8212;those enjoying 
dominant positions in the State apparatus&#8212;had been consolidating their power and 
detaching themselves more and more from the workers. The bureaucracy was already 
assuming alarming proportions. The State machine was in the hands of a single 
Party, itself more and more permeated by careerist elements. A non Party worker 
was worth less, on the scale of everyday life, than an ex bourgeois or nobleman, 
who had belatedly rallied to the Party. Free criticism no longer existed. Any 
Party member could denounce as 'counter revolutionary' any worker simply 
defending his class rights and his dignity as a worker.</p>

<p class="fst">Industrial and agricultural production were declining rapidly. 
There were virtually no raw materials for the factories. Machinery was worn and 
neglected. The main concern of the proletariat was the bitter fight against 
famine. Thefts from the factories had become a sort of compensation for 
miserably paid labour. Such thefts continued despite the repeated searches 
carried out by the Cheka at the factory gates.</p>

<p class="fst">Workers who still had connections with the countryside would go 
there to barter old clothes, matches or salt in exchange for food. The trains 
were crammed with such people (the <i>Mechotchniki</i>). Despite a thousand 
difficulties, they would try to bring food to the famished cities. Working class 
anger would break out repeatedly, as barrages of militia confiscated the paltry 
loads of flour or potatoes workers would be carrying on their backs to prevent 
their children from starving.</p>

<p class="fst">The peasants were submitted to compulsory requisitions. They were 
sowing less, despite the danger of famine that now resulted from bad crops. Bad 
crops had been common. Under ordinary conditions such crops had not 
automatically had these disastrous effects. The cultivated areas were larger and 
the peasants would usually set something aside for more difficult times.</p>

<p class="fst">The situation preceding the Kronstadt uprising can be summed up 
as a fantastic discrepancy between promise and achievement. There were harsh 
economic difficulties. But as important was the fact that the generation in 
question had not forgotten the meaning of the rights it had struggled for during 
the Revolution. This was to provide the real psychological background to the 
uprising.</p>

<p class="fst">The Red Navy had problems of its own. Since the Brest Litovsk 
peace, the Government had undertaken a complete reorganisation of the armed 
forces. on the basis of a rigid discipline, a discipline quite incompatible with 
the erstwhile principle of election of officers by the men. A whole hierarchical 
structure had been introduced. This had gradually stifled the democratic 
tendencies which had prevailed at the onset of the Revolution. For purely 
technical reasons such a reorganisation had not been possible in the Navy, where 
revolutionary traditions had strong roots. Most of the naval officers had gone 
over to the Whites, and the sailors still retained many of the democratic rights 
they had won in 1917. It had not been possible completely to dismantle their 
organisations.</p>

<p class="fst">This state of affairs was in striking contrast with what 
pertained in the rest of the armed forces. It could not last. Differences 
between the rank and file sailors and the higher command of the armed forces 
steadily increased. With the end of the Civil War in European Russia these 
differences became explosive.</p>

<p class="fst">Discontent was rampant not only among the non Party sailors. It 
also affected Communist sailors. Attempts to "discipline" the Fleet by 
introducing "Army customs" met with stiff resistance from 1920 on. Zef, a 
leading Party member and a member of the Revolutionary War Committee for the 
Baltic Fleet, was officially denounced by the Communist sailors for his 
"dictatorial attitudes." The enormous gap developing between the rank and file 
and the leadership was shown up during the elections to the Eighth Congress of 
Soviets, held in December 1920. At the naval base of Petrograd large numbers of 
sailors had noisily left the electoral meeting, openly protesting against the 
dispatch there as official delegates of people from Politotdiel and from Comflot 
(i.e., from the very organisations monopolising political control of the Navy).</p>

<p class="fst">On 15th. February 1921, the Second Conference of Communist 
Sailors of the Baltic Fleet had met. It had assembled 300 delegates who had 
voted for the following resolutions:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"This Second Conference of Communist Sailors condemns the work of 
Poubalt (Political Section of the Baltic Fleet).</p>

<p class="quoteb">1. Poubalt has not only separated itself from the masses but also 
from the active functionaries. It has become transformed into a bureaucratic 
organ enjoying no authority among the sailors.</p>

<p class="quoteb">2. There is total absence of plan or method in the work of 
Poubalt. There is also a lack of agreement between its actions and the 
resolutions adopted at the Ninth Party Congress.</p>

<p class="quoteb">3. Poubalt, having totally detached itself from the Party masses, 
has destroyed all local initiative. It has transformed all political work into 
paper work. This has had harmful repercussions on the organisation of the masses 
in the Fleet. Between June and November last year, 20 per cent of the (sailor 
Party members have left the Party. This can be explained by the wrong methods of 
the work of Poubalt.</p>

<p class="quoteb">4. The cause is to be found in the very principles of Poubalts 
organisation. These principles must be changed in the direction of greater 
democracy."</p>

<p class="fst">Several delegates demanded in their speeches the total abolition 
of the 'political sections' in the Navy, a demand we will find voiced again in 
the sailors' resolutions during the Kronstadt uprising. This was the frame of 
mind in which the famous discussion on the trade union question preceding the 
Tenth Party Congress took place.</p>

<p class="fst">In the documents of the period one can clearly perceive the will 
of certain Bolshevik leaders (amongst whom Trotsky) not only to ignore the great 
discontent affecting the workers and all those who had fought in the previous 
period, but also to apply military methods to the problems of everyday life, 
particularly to industry and to the trade unions.</p>

<p class="fst">In these heated discussions, the sailors of the Baltic Fleet 
adopted a viewpoint very different from Trotsky's. At the elections to the Tenth 
Party Congress, the Baltic Fleet voted solidly against its leaders: Trotsky, 
Peoples Commissar of War (under whose authority the Navy came), and Raskolnikov, 
Chief of the Baltic Fleet. Trotsky and Raskolnikov were in agreement on the 
Trade Union question.</p>

<p class="fst">The sailors sought to protest against the developing situation by 
abandoning the Party en masse. According to information released by Sorine, 
Commissar for Petrograd, 5,000 sailors left the Party in January 1921 alone.</p>

<p class="fst">There is no doubt that the discussion taking place within the 
Party at this time had profound effects on the masses. It overflowed the narrow 
limits the Party sought to impose on it. It spread to the working class as a 
whole, to the solders and to the sailors. Heated local criticism acted as a 
general catalyst. The proletariat had reasoned quite logically: if discussion 
and criticism were permitted to Party members, why should they not be permitted 
to the masses themselves who had endured all the hardships of the Civil War?</p>

<p class="fst">In his speech to the Tenth Congress&#8212;published in the Congress 
Proceedings&#8212;Lenin voiced his regret at having 'permitted' such a discussion. 'We 
have certainly committed an error,' he said, 'in having authorised this debate. 
Such a discussion was harmful just before the Spring months that would be loaded 
with such difficulties.'</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">2. Petrograd on the Eve of Kronstadt</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Despite the fact that the population of Petrograd had diminished 
by two thirds, the winter of 1920-21 proved to be a particularly hard one.</p>

<p class="fst">Food in the city had been scarce since February 1917 and the 
situation had deteriorated from month to month. The town had always relied on 
food stuffs brought in from other parts of the country. During the Revolution 
the rural economy was in crisis in many of these regions. The countryside could 
only feed the capital to a very small extent. The catastrophic condition of the 
railways made things even worse. The ever increasing antagonisms between town 
and country created further difficulties everywhere.</p>

<p class="fst">To these partly unavoidable factors must be added the 
bureaucratic degeneration of the administration and the rapacity of the State 
organs for food supply. Their role in feeding the population was actually a 
negative one. If the population of Petrograd did not die of hunger during this 
period, it was above all thanks to its own adaptability and initiative. It got 
food wherever it could!</p>

<p class="fst">Barter was practised on a large scale. There was still some food 
to be had in the countryside, despite the smaller area under cultivation. The 
peasant would exchange this produce for the goods he lacked: boots, petrol, 
salt, matches. The population of the towns would try and get hold of these 
commodities in any way it could. They alone had real value. It would take them 
to the country side. In exchange people would carry back a few pounds of flour 
or potatoes. As we have mentioned before, the few trains, unheated, would be 
packed with men carrying bags on their shoulders. En root, the trains would 
often have to stop because they had run out of fuel. Passengers would get off 
and cut logs for the boilers.</p>

<p class="fst">Market places had officially been abolished. But in nearly all 
towns there were semi tolerated illegal markets, where barter was carried out. 
Such markets existed in Petrograd. Suddenly, in the Summer of 1920, Zinoviev 
issued a decree forbidding any kind of commercial transaction. The few small 
shops still open were closed and their doors sealed. However, the State 
apparatus was in no position to supply the towns. From this moment on, famine 
could no longer be attenuated by the initiative of the population. It became 
extreme. In January 1921, according to information published by Petrokommouns 
(the State Supplies of the town of Petrograd), workers in metal smelting 
factories were allocated rations of 800 grams of black bread a day; shock 
workers in other factories 600 grams; workers with A.V. cards: 400 grams; other 
workers: 200 grams. Black bread was the staple diet of the Russian people at 
this time.</p>

<p class="fst">But even these official rations were distributed irregularly and 
in even smaller amounts than those stipulated. Transport workers would receive, 
at irregular intervals, the equivalent of 700 to 1,000 calories a day. Lodgings 
were unheated. There was a great shortage of both clothing and footwear. 
According to official statistics, working class wages in 1920 in Petrograd were 
only 9 per cent. of those in 1913.</p>

<p class="fst">The population was drifting away from the capital. All who had 
relatives in the country had rejoined them. The authentic proletariat remained 
till the end, having the most slender connections with the countryside.</p>

<p class="fst">This fact must be emphasised, in order to nail the official lies 
seeking to attribute the Petrograd strikes that were soon to break out to 
peasant elements, 'insufficiently steeled in proletarian ideas.' The real 
situation was the very opposite. A few workers were seeking refuge in the 
countryside. The bulk remained. There was certainly no exodus of peasants into 
the starving towns! A few thousand 'Troudarmeitzys' (soldiers of the labour 
armies), then in Petrograd, did not modify the picture. It was the famous 
Petrograd proletariat, the proletariat which had played such a leading role in 
both previous revolutions, that was finally to resort to the classical weapon of 
the class struggle: the strike.</p>

<p class="fst">The first strike broke out at the Troubotchny factory, on 23rd 
February 1921. On the 24th, the strikers organised a mass demonstration in the 
street. Zinovlev sent detachments of 'Koursanty' (student officers) against 
them. The strikers tried to contact the Finnish Barracks. Meanwhile, the strikes 
were spreading. The Baltisky factory stopped work. Then the Laferma factory and 
a number of others: the Skorokhod shoe factory, the Admiralteiski factory, the 
Bormann and Metalischeski plants, and finally, on 28th February, the great 
Putilov works itself.</p>

<p class="fst">The strikers were demanding measures to assist food supplies. 
Some factories were demanding the re-establishment of the local markets, freedom 
to travel within a radius of thirty miles of the city, and the withdrawal of the 
militia detachments holding the road around the town. But side by side with 
these economic demands. several factories were putting forward more political 
demands freedom of speech and of the Press, the freeing of working class 
political prisoners. In several big factories, Party spokesmen were refused a 
hearing.</p>

<p class="fst">Confronted with the misery of the Russian workers who were 
seeking an outlet to their intolerable conditions, the servile Party Committee 
and Zinoviev, (who according to numerous accounts was behaving in Petrograd like 
a real tyrant), could find no better methods of persuasion than brute force.</p>

<p class="fst">Poukhov<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a>, 'official' historian of the Kronstadt revolt, wrote 
that 'decisive class measures were needed to overcome the enemies of the 
revolution who were using a non class conscious section of the proletariat, in 
order to wrench power from the working class and its vanguard, the Communist 
Party.'</p>

<p class="fst">On 24th. February, the Party leaders set up a special General 
Staff, called the Committee of Defence. It was composed of three people: 
Lachevitch, Anzelovitch and Avrov. They were to be supported by a number of 
technical assistants. In each district of the town, a similar Committee of Three 
('troika') was to be set up, composed of the local Party organiser, the 
commander of the Party battalion of the local territorial brigade and of a 
Commissar from the Officers' Training Corps. Similar Committees were organised 
in the outlying districts. These were composed of the local Party organiser, the 
President of the Executive of the local Soviet and the military Commissar for 
the District.</p>

<p class="fst">On 24th February the Committee of Defence proclaimed a state of 
siege in Petrograd. All circulation on the streets was forbidden after 11 PM, as 
were all meetings and gatherings, both out of doors and indoors, that had not 
been specifically permitted by the Defence Committee. 'All infringements would 
be dealt with according to military law.' The decree was signed by Avrov (later 
shot by the Stalinists), Commander of the Petrograd military region, by 
Lachevitch (who later committed suicide), a member of the War Council, and by 
Bouline (later shot by the Stalinists), Commander of the fortified Petrograd 
District.</p>

<p class="fst">A general mobilisation of party members was decreed. Special 
detachments were created, to be sent to "special destinations". At the same 
time, the militia detachments guarding the roads in and out of the town were 
withdrawn. Then the strike leaders were arrested.</p>

<p class="fst">On 26th February the Kronstadt sailors, naturally interested in 
all that was going on in Petrograd, sent delegates to find out about the 
strikes. The delegation visited a number factories. It returned to Kronstadt on 
the 28th. That same day, the crew of the battleship 'Petropavlovsk,' having 
discussed the situation, voted the following resolution:<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Having heard the reports of the representatives sent by the 
General Assembly of the Fleet to find out about the situation in Petrograd, the 
sailors demand:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"1. immediate new elections to the Soviets. The present Soviets no 
longer express the wishes of the workers and peasants. The new elections should 
be by secret ballot, and should be preceded by free electoral propaganda.</p>

<p class="quoteb">2. 
Freedom of speech and of the press for workers and peasants, for the Anarchists, 
and for the Left Socialist parties.</p>

<p class="quoteb">3. The right of assembly, and freedom for 
trade union and peasant organisations.</p>

<p class="quoteb">4. The organisation, at the latest on 
10th March 1921, of a Conference of non-Party workers, solders and sailors of 
Petrograd, Kronstadt and the Petrograd District.</p>

<p class="quoteb">5. The liberation of all 
political prisoners of the Socialist parties, and of all imprisoned workers and 
peasants, soldiers and sailors belonging to working class and peasant 
organisations.</p>

<p class="quoteb">6. The election of a commission to look into the dossiers of all 
those detained in prisons and concentration camps.</p>

<p class="quoteb">7. The abolition of all 
political sections in the armed forces. No political party should have 
privileges for the propagation of its ideas, or receive State subsidies to this 
end. In the place of the political sections various cultural groups should be 
set up, deriving resources from the State</p>

<p class="quoteb">8. The immediate abolition of the 
militia detachments set up between towns and countryside.</p>

<p class="quoteb">9. The equalisation of 
rations for all workers, except those engaged in dangerous or unhealthy jobs.</p>

<p class="quoteb">10. The abolition of Party combat detachments in all military groups. The 
abolition of Party guards in factories and enterprises. If guards are required, 
they should be nominated, taking into account the views of the workers.</p>

<p class="quoteb">11. The 
granting to the peasants of freedom of action on their own soil, and of the 
right to own cattle, provided they look after them themselves and do not employ 
hired labour.</p>

<p class="quoteb">12. We request that all military units and officer trainee groups 
associate themselves with this resolution.</p>

<p class="quoteb">13. We demand that the Press give 
proper publicity to this resolution.</p>

<p class="quoteb">14. We demand the institution of mobile 
workers' control groups.</p>

<p class="quoteb">15. We demand that handicraft production be authorised 
provided it does not utilise wage labour."</p>

<p class="fst">The Kronstadt sailors and the Petrograd strikers knew quite well 
that Russia's economic status was at the root of the political crisis. Their 
discontent was caused both by the famine and by the whole evolution of the 
political situation. The Russian workers were increasingly disillusioned in 
their greatest hope: the Soviets. Daily they saw the power of a single Party 
substituting itself for that of the Soviets. A Party, moreover, which was 
degenerating rapidly through the exercise of absolute power, and which was 
already riddled with careerists. It was against the monopoly exercised by this 
Party in all fields of life that the working class sought to react.</p>

<p class="fst">Point one of the Kronstadt resolution expressed an idea shared by 
the best elements of the Russian working class. Totally 'bolshevised' Soviets no 
longer reflected the wishes of the workers and peasants. Hence the demand for 
new elections, to be carried out according to the principal of full equality for 
all working class political tendencies.</p>

<p class="fst">Such a regeneration of the Soviets would imply the granting to 
all working class tendencies of the possibility for expressing themselves 
freely, without fear of calumny or extermination. Hence, quite naturally, there 
followed the idea of freedom of expression, of the Press, of Assembly and of 
organisation, contained in Point two.</p>

<p class="fst">We must stress that by 1921 the class struggle in the countryside 
had been fought to a virtual standstill. The vast majority of the kulaks had 
been dispossessed. It is quite wrong to claim that the granting of basic 
freedoms to the peasants&#8212;as demanded in Point three&#8212;would have meant restoring 
political rights to the kulaks. It was only a few years later that the peasants 
were exhorted to 'enrich themselves'&#8212;and this by Bukharin, then an official 
Party spokesman.</p>

<p class="fst">The Kronstadt revolution had the merit of stating things openly 
and clearly. But it was breaking no new ground. Its main ideas were being 
discussed everywhere. For having, in one way or another, put forward precisely 
such ideas, workers and peasants were already filling the prisons and the 
recently set up concentration camps. The men of Kronstadt did not desert their 
comrades. Point six of their resolution shows that they intended to look into 
the whole juridical apparatus. They already had serious doubts as to its 
objectivity as an organ of their rule. The Kronstadt sailors were thereby 
showing a spirit of solidarity in the best working class tradition. In July 
1917, Kerensky had arrested a deputation of the Baltic Fleet that had come to 
Petrograd. Kronstadt had immediately sent a further deputation to insist on 
their release. In 1921, this tradition was being spontaneously renewed.</p>

<p class="fst">Points seven and ten of the resolution attacked the political 
monopoly being exercised by the ruling Party. The Party was using State funds in 
an exclusive and uncontrolled manner to extend its influence both in the Army 
and in the police.</p>

<p class="fst">Point nine of their resolution demanded equal rations for all 
workers This destroys Trotsky's accusation of 1938<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> according to which 'the 
men of Kronstadt wanted privileges, while the country was hungry.'</p>

<p class="fst">Point fourteen clearly raised the question of workers control. 
Both before and during the October Revolution this demand had provoked powerful 
echo among the working class. The Kronstadt sailors understood quite clearly 
that real control had escaped from the hands of the rank and file. They sought 
to bring it back. The Bolshevik meanwhile sought to vest all control in the 
hands of a special Commissariat, the Rabkrin&#8212;Workers and Peasants inspection<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a>.</p>

<p class="fst">Point eleven reflected the demands of the peasants to whom the 
Kronstadt sailors had remained linked&#8212;as had, as a matter of fact, the whole of 
the Russian proletariat. The basis of this link is to be found in the specific 
history of Russian industry. Because of feudal backwardness, Russian industry 
did not find its roots in petty handicraft. In their great majority, the Russian 
workers came directly from the peasantry. This must be stressed. The Baltic 
sailors of 1921 were, it is true, closely linked with the peasantry. But neither 
more so nor less than had been the sailors of 1917.</p>

<p class="fst">In their resolution, the Kronstadt sailors were taking up once 
again one of the big demands of October. They were supporting those peasant 
claims demanding the land and the right to own cattle for those peasants who did 
not exploit the labour of others. In 1921, moreover, there was another aspect to 
this particular demand. It was an attempt to solve the food question, which was 
becoming desperate. Under the system of forced requisition, the population of 
the towns was literally dying of hunger. Why, incidentally, should the 
satisfaction of these demands be deemed 'tactically correct' when advocated by 
Lenin, in March 1921, and 'counter revolutionary' when put forward by the 
peasants themselves a few weeks earlier?</p>

<p class="fst">What was so counter revolutionary about the Kronstadt programme. 
What could justify the crusade launched by the Party against Kronstadt? A 
workers and peasants' regime that did not wish to base itself exclusively on 
lies and terror, had to take account of the peasantry. It need not thereby have 
lost its revolutionary character. The men of Kronstadt were not alone, moreover, 
in putting forward such demands in 1921, Makhnos followers were still active in 
the Ukraine. This revolutionary peasant movement was evolving its own ideas and 
methods of struggle. The Ukrainian peasantry had played a predominant role in 
chasing out the feudal hordes. It had earned the right itself to determine the 
forms of its social life.</p>

<p class="fst">Despite Trotsky s categorical and unsubstantiated assertions, the 
Makhno movement was in no sense whatsoever a kulak movement. Koubanin, the 
official Bolshevik historian of the Makhno movement, shows statistically, in a 
book edited by the Party's Historical institute, that the Makhno movement at 
first appeared and developed most rapidly, in precisely those areas where the 
peasants were poorest. The Makhno movement was crushed before it had a chance of 
showing in practice its full creative abilities. The fact that during the Civil 
War it had been capable of creating its own specific forms of struggle, leads 
one to guess that it could have been capable of a lot more.</p>

<p class="fst">As a matter of fact, in relation to agrarian policy, nothing was 
to prove more disastrous than the zig zags of the Bolsheviks. In 1931, ten years 
after Kronstadt, Stalin was to decree his famous 'liquidation of the kulaks.' 
This resulted in an atrocious famine and in the loss of millions of human lives.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us finally consider Point fifteen of the Kronstadt 
resolution, demanding freedom for handicraft production. This was not a question 
of principle. For the workers of Kronstadt, handicraft production was to 
compensate for an industrial production that had fallen to nought. Through this 
demand they were seeking a way out of their intolerable economic plight.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h7">3. Mass meetings and Bolshevik slanders</a></h3>

<h4><a name="h8">Mass Meetings</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The Kronstadt Soviet was due to be renewed on 2nd. March.</p>

<p class="fst">A meeting of the First and Second Battleship Sections had been 
planned for 1st. March. The notification had been published in the official 
journal of the city of Kronstadt. The speakers were to include Kalinin, 
President of the All Russian Executive of Soviets, and Kouzmin, political 
commissar to the Baltic Fleet. When Kalinin arrived, he was received with music 
and flags. All military honours were accorded him.</p>

<p class="fst">Sixteen thousand people attended the meeting. Party member 
Vassiliev, president of the local soviet, took the chair. The delegates who had 
visited Petrograd the previous day gave their reports. The resolution adopted on 
28th. February by the crew of the battleship 'Petropavlovsk' was distributed. 
Kalinin and Kouzmin opposed the resolution. They proclaimed that 'Kronstadt did 
not represent the whole of Russia.'</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, the mass assembly adopted the Petropavlovsk 
resolution. In fact only two people voted against it: Kalinin and Kouzmin!</p>

<p class="fst">The mass assembly decided to send a delegation of 30 workers to 
Petrograd to study the situation on the spot. It was also decided to invite 
delegates from Petrograd to visit Kronstadt, so that they would get to know what 
the sailors were really thinking. A further mass meeting was planned for the 
following day, grouping delegates from ships' crews, from the Red Army groups, 
from State institutions, from the dockyards and factories, and from the trade 
unions, to decide on the procedure of new elections to the local soviet. At the 
end of the meeting, Kalinin was allowed to regain Petrograd in all safety.</p>

<p class="fst">The following day, 2nd. March, the delegates meeting took place 
in the House of Culture. According to the official Kronstadt '<a href="../../../history/ussr/events/kronstadt/izvestia/index.htm">Izvestia</a>', the 
appointment of delegates had taken place properly. The delegates all insisted 
that the elections be carried out in a loyal and correct manner. Kouzmin and 
Vassiliev spoke first. Kouzmin stated that the Party would not relinquish power 
without a fight. Their speeches were so aggressive and provocative that the 
assembly ordered them to leave the meeting and put them under arrest. Other 
Party members were, however, allowed to speak at length during the debate.</p>

<p class="fst">The meeting of delegates endorsed by an overwhelming majority the 
Petropavlovsk resolution. It then got down to examining in detail the question 
of elections to the new soviet. These elections were to 'prepare the peaceful 
reconstruction of the Soviet regime.' The work was constantly interrupted by 
rumours, spreading through the assembly, to the effect that the Party was 
preparing to disperse the meeting by force. The situation was extremely tense.</p>

<h4><a name="h9">The Provisional Committee</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Because of the threatening speeches of the representatives of the 
State power&#8212;Kouzmin and Vassiliev&#8212;and fearing retaliation, the assembly decided 
to form a Provisional Revolutionary Committee, to which it entrusted the 
administration of the town and the fortress. The Committee held its first 
session aboard the 'Petropavlovsk', the Battle ship in which Kouzmin and 
Vassiliev were being detained.</p>

<p class="fst">The leading body of the assembly of delegates all became members 
of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee. They were:</p>

<p class="indentb">- Petritchenko, chief quartermaster of the battleship 
'Petropavlovsk',<br>
- Yakovenko, liaison telephonist to the Kronstadt section,<br>
- Ossossov, boiler man in the battleship 'Sebastopol',<br>
- Arkhipov, chief engineer,<br>
- Perepelkin, electrician in the battleship 'Sebastopol',<br>
- Patrouchev, chief electrician in the 'Petropavlovsk',<br>
- Koupolov, head male nurse,<br>
- Verchinin, sailor in the 'Sebastopol',<br>
- Toukin, worker in the 'Electrotechnical' factory,<br>
- Romanenko, docks maintenance worker,<br>
- Orechin, headmaster of the Third labour School,<br>
- Valk, sawmill worker,<br>
- Pavlov, worker in a marine mining shop,<br>
- Boikev, head of the building section of the Kronstadt fortress,<br>
- Kilgast, harbour pilot.</p>

<p class="fst">The majority of the members of the Provisional Revolutionary 
Committee were sailors with a long service. This contradicts the official 
version of the Kronstadt events, which seeks to attribute the leadership of the 
revolt to elements recently joining the Navy and having nothing in common with 
the heroic sailors of 1917-1919.</p>

<p class="fst">The first proclamation of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee 
stated: 'We are concerned to avoid bloodshed. Our aim is to create through the 
joint efforts of town and fortress the proper conditions for regular and honest 
elections to the new soviet.'</p>

<p class="fst">Later that day, under the leadership of the Provisional 
Revolutionary Committee, the inhabitants of Kronstadt occupied all strategic 
points in the town, taking over the State establishments, the Staff 
Headquarters, and the telephone and wireless buildings. Committees were elected 
in all battleships and regiments. At about 9:00 p.m., most of the forts and most 
detachments of the Red Army had rallied. Delegates coming from Oranienbaum had 
also declared their support for the Provisional Revolutionary Committee. That 
same day the '<a href="../../../history/ussr/events/kronstadt/izvestia/index.htm">Izvestia</a>' printshops were occupied.</p>

<p class="fst">On the morrow, 3rd. March, the men of Kronstadt published the 
first issue of the '<i>Izvestia of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee</i>'.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> 
In it one read: 'The Communist Party, master of the State, has detached itself 
from the masses. It has shown itself incapable of getting the country out of its 
mess. Countless incidents have recently occurred in Petrograd and Moscow which 
show clearly that the Party has lost the confidence of the working masses. The 
Party is ignoring working class demands because it believes that these demands 
are the result of counter revolutionary activity. In this the Party is making a 
profound mistake. '</p>

<h4><a name="h10">Bolshevik Slanders</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile, Moscow Radio was broadcasting as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Struggle against the White Guard Plot." And, "Just like other 
White Guard insurrections, the mutiny of ex General Kozlovsky and the crew of 
the battle ship 'Petropavlovsk' has been organised by Entente spies. This is 
clear from the fact that the French paper 'Le Monde' published the following 
message from Helsingfors two weeks before the revolt of General Kozlovsky: 'We 
are informed from Petrograd that as the result of the recent Kronstadt revolt, 
the Bolshevik military authorities have taken a whole series of measures to 
isolate the town and to prevent the soldiers and sailors of Kronstadt from 
entering Petrograd.' "</p>

<p class="quoteb">"It is therefore clear that the Kronstadt revolt is being led 
from Paris. The French counter espionage is mixed up in the whole affair. 
History is repeating itself. The Socialist Revolutionaries, who have their 
headquarters in Paris, are preparing the ground for an insurrection against the 
Soviet power. The ground prepared, their real master, the Tsarist general 
appeared. The history of Koltchak, installing his power in the wake of that of 
the Socialist Revolutionaries, is being repeated." (Radio Stanzia Moskva and 
Radio Vestnik Rosta Moskva, 3rd. March 1921.)</p>

<p class="fst">The two antagonists saw the facts differently. Their outlooks 
were poles apart.</p>

<p class="fst">The call issued by Moscow's Radio was obviously coming from the 
Politbureau's top leaders. It had Lenin's approval, who must have been fully 
aware of what was happening at Kronstadt. Even assuming that he had to rely on 
Zinoviev for information, whom he knew to be cowardly and liable to panic, it is 
difficult to believe that Lenin misunderstood the real state of affairs. On 2nd. 
March, Kronstadt had sent an official delegation to see him. It would have been 
enough to cross question it in order to ascertain the true situation.</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin, Trotsky, and the whole Party leadership knew quite well 
that this was no mere 'generals' revolt'. Why then invent this legend about 
General Kozlovsky, leader of the mutiny? The answer lies in the Bolshevik 
outlook, an outlook at times so blind that it could not see that lies were as 
likely to prove nefarious as to prove helpful. The legend of General Kozlovsky 
opened the path to another legend: that of the Wrangel officer allegedly 
conspiring with Trotsky in 1928-29. It in fact opened the path to the massive 
lying of the whole Stalin era.</p>

<p class="fst">Anyway, who was this General Kozlovsky, denounced by the official 
radio as the leader of the insurrection? He was an artillery general, and had 
been one of the first to defect to the Bolsheviks. He seemed devoid of any 
capacity as a leader. At the time of the insurrection he happened to be in 
command of the artillery at Kronstadt. The communist commander of the fortress 
had defected. Kozlovsky, according to the rules prevailing in the fortress, had 
to replace him. He, in fact, refused, claiming that as the fortress was now 
under the jurisdiction of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee, the old rules 
no longer applied. Kozlovsky remained, it is true, in Kronstadt, but only as an 
artillery specialist. Moreover, after the fall of Kronstadt, in certain 
interviews granted to the Finnish press, Kozlovsky accused the sailors of having 
wasted precious time on issues other than the defence of the fortress. He 
explained this in terms of their reluctance to resort to bloodshed. Later, other 
officers of the garrison were also to accuse the sailors of military 
incompetence, and of complete lack of confidence in their technical advisers. 
Kozlovsky was the only general to have been present at Kronstadt. This was 
enough for the Government to make use of his name.</p>

<p class="fst">The men of Kronstadt did, up to a point, make use of the military 
know how of certain officers in the fortress at the time. Some of these officers 
may have given the men advice out of sheer hostility to the Bolsheviks. But in 
their attack on Kronstadt, the Government forces were also making use of ex 
Tsarist officers. On the one side there were Kozlovsky, Salomianov, and 
Arkannihov; On the other, ex Tsarist officers and specialists of the old regime, 
such as Toukhatchevsky. Kamenev, and Avrov. On neither side were these officers 
an independent force.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h11">4. Effects on the Party Rank and File</a></h3>

<p class="fst">On 2nd. March, the Kronstadt sailors, aware of their rights, 
their duties and the moral authority vested in them by their revolutionary past, 
attempted to set the soviets on a better path. They saw how distorted they had 
become through the dictatorship of a single party.</p>

<p class="fst">On 7th. March, the Central Government launched its military 
onslaught against Kronstadt.</p>

<p class="fst">What had happened between these two dates?</p>

<p class="fst">In Kronstadt, the Provisional Revolutionary Committee, enlarged 
during a mass meeting by the co-option of five new members, had started to 
reorganise social life in both town and fortress. It decided to arm the workers 
of Kronstadt to ensure the internal protection of the town. It decreed the 
compulsory re-election, within three days, of the leading trade union committees 
and of the Congress of Trade Unions, in which bodies it wished to vest 
considerable powers.</p>

<p class="fst">Rank and file members of the Communist Party were showing their 
confidence in the Provisional Revolutionary Committee by a mass desertion from 
the Party. A number of them formed a Provisional Party Bureau which issued the 
following appeal:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Give no credence to the absurd rumours spread by provocateurs 
seeking bloodshed according to which responsible Party comrades are being shot 
or to rumours alleging that the Party is preparing an attack against Kronstadt. 
This is an absurd lie, spread by agents of the Entente, seeking to overthrow the 
power of the Soviets.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Provisional Party Bureau considers re-elections to the 
Kronstadt Soviet to be indispensable. It calls on all its supporters to take 
part in these elections.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Provisional Party Bureau calls on all its supporters to 
remain at their posts and to create no obstacles to the measures taken by the 
Provisional Revolutionary Committee. Long live the power of the Soviets! Long 
live international working class unity!</p>

<p class="quoteb">Signed (on behalf of the Provisional Party Bureau of Kronstadt): 
Iline (ex commissar for supplies), Pervouchin (ex President of the local 
Executive Committee), Kabanov (ex President of the Regional Trade Union 
Bureau)".</p>

<p class="fst">The Stalinist historian Poukhov referring to this appeal, 
declared that "it can only be considered a treasonable act and an opportunist 
step towards an agreement with the leaders of the insurrection, who are 
obviously playing a counter revolutionary role"<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a>. Poukhov admits that this 
document had "a certain effect" on the rank and file of the Party. According to 
him, 780 Party members in Kronstadt left the Party at this time!</p>

<p class="fst">Some of those resigning from the Party sent letters to the 
Kronstadt '<a href="../../../history/ussr/events/kronstadt/izvestia/index.htm">Izvestia</a>', giving reasons for their action. The teacher Denissov 
wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"I openly declare to the Provisional Revolutionary Committee 
that as from gunfire directed at Kronstadt, I no longer consider myself a member 
of the Party. I support the call issued by the workers of Kronstadt. All power 
to the Soviets, not to the Party!"</p>

<p class="fst">A military group assigned to the special company dealing with 
discipline also issued a declaration:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"We, the undersigned, joined the Party believing it to express 
the wishes of the working masses. In fact the Party has proved itself an 
executioner of workers and peasants. This is revealed quite clearly by recent 
events in Petrograd. These events show up the face of the Party leaders. The 
recent broadcasts from Moscow show clearly that the Party leaders are prepared 
to resort to any means in order to retain power.</p>

<p class="quoteb">We ask that henceforth, we no longer be considered Party 
members. We rally to the call issued by the Kronstadt garrison in its resolution 
of 2nd. March. We invite other comrades who have become aware of the error of 
their ways, publicly to recognise the fact.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Signed: <i>Gutman, Yefimov</i>, <i>Koudriatzev, Andreev</i>. ('<a href="../../../history/ussr/events/kronstadt/izvestia/index.htm">Izvestia</a>' of 
the Provisional Revolutionary Committee, 7th. March 1921)".</p>

<p class="fst">The Communist Party members in the 'Rif' fort published the 
following resolution:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"During the last three years, many greedy careerists have flocked 
to our Party. This has given rise to bureaucracy and has gravely hampered the 
struggle for economic reconstruction.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Our Party has always faced up to the problem of the struggle 
against the enemies of the proletariat and of the working masses. We publicly 
declare that we intend to continue in the future our defence of the rights 
secured by the working class. We will allow no White Guard to take advantage of 
this difficult situation confronting the Republic of Soviets. At the first 
attempt directed against its power we will know how to retaliate.</p>

<p class="quoteb">We fully accept the authority of the Provisional Revolutionary 
Committee, which is setting itself the objective of creating soviets genuinely 
representing the proletarian and working masses.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Long live the power of the Soviets, the real defenders of 
working class rights.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Signed: the Chairman and Secretary of the meeting of Communists 
in Fort Rif" ('<a href="../../../history/ussr/events/kronstadt/izvestia/index.htm">Izvestia</a>' of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee. 7th. March 
1921.</p>

<p class="fst">Were such declarations forcibly extracted from Party members by 
the regime of terror directed against Party members allegedly reigning in 
Kronstadt at the time? Not a shred of evidence has been produced to this effect. 
<i>Throughout the whole insurrection not a single imprisoned Communist was shot</i>. 
And this despite the fact that among the prisoners were men responsible for the 
fleet such as Kouzmin and Batys. The vast majority of Communist Party members 
were in fact left entirely free.</p>

<p class="fst">In the '<a href="../../../history/ussr/events/kronstadt/izvestia/index.htm">Izvestia</a>' of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee for 
7th. March, one can read under the heading 'We are not seeking revenge', the 
following note:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The prolonged oppression to which the Party dictatorship has 
submitted the workers has provoked a natural indignation among the masses. This 
has led, in certain places, to boycotts and sackings directed against the 
relatives of Party members. This must not take place. We are not seeking 
revenge. We are only defending our interests as workers. We must act cautiously. 
We must only take action against those who sabotage or those who through lying 
propaganda seek to prevent a reassertion of working class power and rights".</p>

<p class="fst">In Petrograd, however, humanist ideas of rather a different kind 
were prevailing. As soon as the arrests of Kouzmin and Vassiliev were learned, 
the Defence Committee ordered the arrests of the families of all Kronstadt 
sailors known to be living in Petrograd. A Government plane showered Kronstadt 
with leaflets saying:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The Defence Committee an announces that it has arrested and 
imprisoned the families of the sailors as hostages for the safety of communist 
comrades arrested by the Kronstadt mutineers. We refer specifically to the 
safety of Fleet Commissar Kouzmin, and Vassiliev, President of the Kronstadt 
Soviet. If a hair of their heads is touched, the hostages will pay with their 
lives". ('<a href="../../../history/ussr/events/kronstadt/izvestia/index.htm">Izvestia</a>' of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee, 5th. 
March 1921).</p>

<p class="fst">The Provisional Revolutionary Committee replied with the 
following radio message:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In the name of the Kronstadt garrison, the Provisional 
Revolutionary Committee of Kronstadt insists on the liberation, within 24 hours, 
of the families of the workers, sailors and red soldiers arrested as hostages by 
the Petrograd Soviet.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Kronstadt garrison assures you that in the city of 
Kronstadt, Party members are entirely free and that their families enjoy 
absolute immunity. We refuse to follow the example of the Petrograd Soviet. We 
consider such methods, even when conducted by ferocious hatred, as utterly 
shameful and degrading.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Signed: Petritchenko, sailor, President of the Provisional 
Revolutionary Committee; Kilgast, Secretary".</p>

<p class="fst">To refute rumours according to which Party members were being 
ill-treated, the Provisional Revolutionary Committee set up a special Commission 
to investigate the cases of the imprisoned communists. In its issue of 4th. 
March, the '<a href="../../../history/ussr/events/kronstadt/izvestia/index.htm">Izvestia</a>' of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee announced that 
a Party member would be attached to the Commission. It is doubtful if this body 
ever got to work, as two days later the bombardment of Kronstadt began. The 
Provisional Revolutionary Committee did, however, receive a Party delegation. It 
granted it permission to visit the prisoners in the 'Petropavlovsk'. The 
prisoners had even been allowed to hold meetings among themselves, and to edit a 
wall newspaper. (Zaikovski: 'Kronstadt from 1917 to 1921')</p>

<p class="fst">There was no terror in Kronstadt. Under very difficult and tragic 
circumstances, the 'rebels had done their utmost to apply the basic principles 
of working class democracy. If many rank and file communists decided to support 
the Provisional Revolutionary Committee, it was because this body expressed the 
wishes and aspirations of the working people. In retrospect, this democratic 
self assertion of Kronstadt may appear surprising. It certainly contrasted with 
the actions and frame of mind prevailing among the Party leaders in Petrograd 
and Moscow. They remained blind, deaf and totally lacking in understanding of 
what Kronstadt and the working masses of the whole of Russia really wanted.</p>

<p class="fst">Catastrophe could still have been averted during those tragic 
days: Why then did the Petrograd Defence Committee use such abusive language? 
The only conclusion an objective observer can come to is that it was done with 
the deliberate intention of provoking bloodshed, thereby 'teaching everyone a 
lesson' as to the need for absolute submission to the central power.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h12">5. Threats, Bribes and Skirmishes</a></h3>
<h4><a name="h13">Threats and Bribes</a></h4>

<p class="fst">On 5th. March, the Petrograd Defence Committee issued a call to 
the rebels.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"You are being told fairy tales when they tell you that Petrograd 
is with you or that the Ukraine supports you. These are impertinent lies. The 
last sailor in Petrograd abandoned you when he learned that you were led by 
generals like Kozlovskv. Siberia and the Ukraine support the Soviet power. Red 
Petrograd laughs at the miserable efforts of a handful of White Guards and 
Socialist Revolutionaries. You are surrounded on all sides. A few hours more 
will lapse and then you will he compelled to surrender. Kronstadt has neither 
bread nor fuel. <i>If you insist, we will shoot you like partridges</i>.</p>

<p class="quoteb">At the last minute, all those generals, the Kozlovskvs, the 
Bourksers, and all that riff raff, the Petrichenkos, and the Tourins will flee 
to Finland, to the White guards. And you, rank and file soldiers and sailors, 
where will you go then? Don't believe them when they promise to feed you in 
Finland. Haven't you heard what happened to Wrangel's supporters? They were 
transported to Constantinople. There they are dying like flies, in their 
thousands, of hunger and disease. This is the fate that awaits you, unless you 
immediately take a grip of yourselves. Surrender Immediately! Don't waste a 
minute. Collect your weapons and come over to us. Disarm and arrest your 
criminal leaders, and in particular the Tsarist generals. Whoever surrenders 
immediately will be forgiven. Surrender now.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Signed: The Defence Committee".</p>

<p class="fst">In reply to these threats from Petrograd, the Provisional 
Revolutionary Committee Issued a final appeal.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"TO ALL, TO ALL, TO ALL.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Comrades, workers, red soldiers and sailors. Here in Kronstadt we 
know full well how much you and your wives and your children are suffering under 
the iron rule of the Party. We have overthrown the Party dominated Soviet. The 
Provisional Revolutionary Committee is today starting elections to a new Soviet. 
It will be freely elected, and it will reflect the wishes of the whole working 
population, and of the garrison&#8212;and not just those of a handful of Party 
members.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Our cause is just. We stand for the power of the Soviets, not 
for that of the Party. We stand for freely elected representatives of the 
toiling masses. Deformed Soviets, dominated by the Party, have remained deaf to 
our pleas. Our appeals have been answered with bullets.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The workers' patience is becoming exhausted. So now they are 
seeking to pacify you with crumbs. On Zinoviev's orders the militia barrages 
have been withdrawn. Moscow has allocated ten million gold roubles for the 
purchase abroad of food stuffs and other articles of first necessity. But we 
know that the Petrograd proletariat will not be bought over in this way. Over 
the heads of the Party, we hold out to you the fraternal hand of revolutionary 
Kronstadt.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Comrades, you are being deceived. And truth is being distorted 
by the basest of calumnies.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Comrades, don't allow yourselves to be misled.</p>

<p class="quoteb">In Kronstadt, power is in the hands of the sailors, of the red 
soldiers and of the revolutionary workers. It is not in the hands of white 
Guards commanded by General Kozlovsky, as Moscow Radio Iyingly asserts.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Signed: The Provisional Revolutionary Committee".</p>

<p class="fst">Foreign communists were in Moscow and Petrograd at the time of 
the revolt. They were in close contact with leading Party circles. They 
confirmed that the Government had made hasty purchases abroad (even chocolate 
was bought, which had always been a luxury in Russia). Moscow and Petrograd had 
suddenly changed their tactics. The Government had a better grasp of 
psychological war than had the men of Kronstadt. It understood the corrupting 
influence of white bread on a starving population. It was in vain that Kronstadt 
asserted that crumbs would not buy the Petrograd proletariat. The Government's 
methods had undoubted effect, especially when combined with vicious repression 
directed against the strikers.</p>

<h4><a name="h14">Support in Petrograd</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Part of the Petrograd proletariat continued to strike during the 
Kronstadt events. Poukhov, the Party historian, himself admits this. The workers 
were demanding the liberation of the prisoners. In certain factories, copies of 
the 'Ivestia' of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee were found plastered on 
the walls. A lorry even drove through the street of Petrograd scattering 
leaflets from Kronstadt. In certain enterprises (for instance, the State 
Printing Works No. 26), the workers refused to adopt a resolution condemning the 
Kronstadt sailors. At the 'Arsenal' factory, the workers organised a mass 
meeting on 7th. March, (the day the bombardment of Kronstadt began). This 
meeting adopted a resolution of the mutinous sailors! It elected a commission 
which was to go from factory to factory, agitating for a general strike.</p>

<p class="fst">Strikes were continuing in the biggest factories of Petrograd: 
Poutilov, Baltisky, Oboukhov, Nievskaia Manoufactura, etc. The authorities 
sacked the striking workers, transferred the factories to the authority of the 
local troikas (three men committees), who proceeded to selective rehiring of 
workers. Other repressive measures were also taken against the strikers.</p>

<p class="fst">Strikes were also starting in Moscow, in Nijni Novgorod and In 
other cities. But here too, the prompt delivery of foodstuffs, combined with 
calumnies to the effect that Tsarist generals were in command at Kronstadt had 
succeeded in sowing doubts among the workers.</p>

<p class="fst">The Bolsheviks' aim had been achieved. The proletariat of 
Petrograd and of the other industrial cities was in a state of confusion. The 
Kronstadt sailors, who had been hoping for the support of the whole of working 
class Russia, remained isolated, confronting a Government determined to 
annihilate them, whatever the cost.</p>

<h4><a name="h15">First Skirmishes</a></h4>

<p class="fst">On 6th. March, Trotsky addressed an appeal by radio to the 
Kronstadt garrison:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The Workers' and Peasants' Government has decided to reassert 
its authority without delay, both over Kronstadt and over the mutinous 
battleships, and to put them at the disposal of the Soviet Republic. I therefore 
order all those who have raised a hand against the Socialist Fatherland, 
immediately to lay down their weapons. Those who resist will be disarmed and put 
at the disposal of the Soviet Command. The arrested commissars and other 
representatives of the Government must be freed immediately. Only those who 
surrender unconditionally will be able to count on the clemency of the Soviet 
Republic. I am meanwhile giving orders that everything be prepared to smash the 
revolt and the rebels by force of arms. The responsibility for the disasters 
which will effect the civilian population must fall squarely on the heads of the 
White Guard insurgents.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Signed: Trotsky, President of the Military Revolutionary Council 
of the Soviet Republic, KAMENEV,<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> Glavkom (Commanding Officer)".</p>

<p class="fst">On 8th. March, a plane flew over Kronstadt and dropped a bomb. On 
the following days, Government artillery continued to shell the fortress and 
neighbouring forts, but met with stiff resistance. Aircraft dropped bombs which 
provoked such fury among the civilian population that they started firing back. 
The Provisional Revolutionary Committee had to order the defenders not to waste 
their ammunition.</p>

<p class="fst">By 1921 the Kronstadt garrison had been markedly reduced. Figures 
issued by the General Staff of the defenders put the number at 3,000. Gaps 
between infantrymen defending the perimeter were at least 32 feet wide. Stocks 
of ammunition and shells were also limited.</p>

<p class="fst">During the afternoon of 3rd. March, the Revolutionary Committee 
had met in conference together with certain military specialists. A Military 
Defence Committee was set up which prepared a plan to defend the fortress. But 
when the military advisers proposed an assault in the direction of Oranienbaum 
(where there were food stocks, at Spassatelnaia), the Provisional Revolutionary 
Committee refused. It was not putting its faith in the military capacity of the 
sailors; but in the moral support of the whole of proletarian Russia. Until the 
first shot had been fired, the men of Kronstadt refused to believe that the 
Government would militarily attack them. This is no doubt why the Provisional 
Revolutionary Committee had not set out to prevent the approach of the Red Army 
by breaking the ice around the foot of the fortress. For much the same reasons, 
fortified barrages were not set up along the probable line of attack.</p>

<p class="fst">Kronstadt was right. Militarily they could not win. At best, they 
could have held a fortnight. This might have been important, for once the ice 
had melted, Kronstadt could have become a real fortress, capable of defending 
itself. Nor must we forget that their human reserves were infinitesimal, 
compared with the numbers the Red Army could throw into battle.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h16">6. Demoralisation in the Red Army</a></h3>

<p class="fst">What was morale like in the Red Army at this time? In an 
interview given to '<i>Krasnaia Gazeta</i>', Dybenko<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> described how all the 
military units participating in the assault on Kronstadt had to be reorganised. 
This was an absolute necessity. During the first day of military operations, the 
Red Army had shown that it did not wish to fight against the sailors, against 
the 'bratichki' (little brothers), as they were known at the time. Amongst the 
advanced workers, the Kronstadt sailors were known as people most devoted to the 
Revolution. And anyway, the very motives that were driving Kronstadt to revolt, 
existed among the ranks of the Red Army. Both were hungry and cold, poorly clad 
and poorly shod and this was no mean burden in the Russian winter, especially 
when what was asked of them was to march and fight on ice and snow.</p>

<p class="fst">During the night of 8th. March, when the Red Army attack against 
Kronstadt started, a terrible snow storm was blowing over the Baltic. Thick fog 
made the tracks almost invisible. The Red Army soldiers wore long white blouses 
which hid them well against the snow. This is how Poukhov<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> described morale in 
Infantry Regiment 561 in an official communiqui. The regiment was approaching 
Kronstadt from the Oranienbaum side.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"At the beginning of the operation the second battalion had 
refused to march. With much difficulty and thanks to the presence of communists, 
it was persuaded to venture on the ice. As soon as it reached the first south 
battery, a company of the 2nd. battalion surrendered. The officers had to return 
alone. The regiment stopped. Dawn was breaking. We were without news of the 3rd. 
battalion, which was advancing towards south batteries 1 and 2. The battalion 
was marching in file and was being shelled by artillery from the forts. It then 
spread out and veered to the left of Fort Milioutine, from which red flags were 
being waved. Having advanced a further short distance, it noticed that the 
rebels had fitted machine guns on the forts, and were offering them the choice 
of surrendering or being massacred. Everybody surrendered, except the battalion 
commissar and three or four soldiers who turned back on their steps".</p>

<p class="fst">On 8th. March, Oublanov, Commissar for the Northern Sector, wrote 
to the Petrograd Party:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"I consider it my revolutionary duty to clarify you as to the 
state of affairs on the northern sector. It is impossible to send the Army into 
a second attack on the forts. I have already spoken to Comrades Lachevitch, 
Avrov and Trotsky about the morale of the Koursantys (cadet officers, deemed 
most fit for battle). I have to report the following tendencies. The men wish to 
know the demands of Kronstadt. They want to send delegates to Kronstadt. The 
number of political commissars in this sector is far from sufficient".</p>

<p class="fst">Army morale was also revealed in the case of the 79th. Brigade of 
the 27th Omsk Division. The Division comprised three regiments. It had shown its 
fighting capacities in the struggle against Koltchak. On 12th. March, the 
division was brought to the Kronstadt front. The Orchane regiment refused to 
fight against Kronstadt. The following day, in the two other regiments of the 
same division, the soldiers organised impromptu meetings where they discussed 
what attitude to take. Two of the regiments had to be disarmed by force, and the 
'revolutionary' tribunal posed heavy sentences.</p>

<p class="fst">There were many similar cases. Not only were the soldiers 
unwilling to fight against their class brothers, but they were not prepared to 
fight on the ice in the month of March. Units had been brought in from other 
regions of the country, where by mid March the ice was melting already. They had 
little confidence in the solidity of the Baltic ice. Those who had taken part in 
the first assault, had seen that the shells from Kronstadt were opening up 
enormous holes in its surface, in which the unfortunate Government troops were 
being engulfed. These were hardly encouraging scenes. All this contributed to 
the failure of the first assaults against Kronstadt.</p>

<h4><a name="h17">Reorganisation</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The regiments to be used in the final assault against Kronstadt 
were thoroughly reorganised. Groups that had shown any sympathy towards 
Kronstadt were disarmed and transferred to other units. Some were severely 
punished by the Revolutionary Tribunal. Party members were mobilised and 
allocated to various battalions for purposes of propaganda and for reporting 
back on unsure elements.</p>

<p class="fst">Between 8th. and 15th. of March, while the cannons exchanged fire 
over the ice at Kronstadt, the Tenth Party Congress was held in Moscow. The 
Congress despatched 300 delegates to the front, among them Vorochilov, Boubnov, 
Zatousky, Roukhimovitch and Piatakov. The 'delegates' were nominated 'political 
commissars' and appointed to the military section of the Tcheka, or to 'special 
commissions for the struggle against desertion'. Some just fought in the ranks.</p>

<p class="fst">The Revolutionary Tribunals were working overtime. Poukhov 
describes how 'they would vigorously react to all unhealthy tendencies. 
Troublemakers and provocateurs were punished according to their deserts'. The 
sentences would immediately be made known to the soldiers. Some times they would 
even be published in the papers.</p>

<p class="fst">But despite all the propaganda, all the reorganisation, and all 
the repression, the soldiers retained their doubts. On 14th. March, there were 
further acts of insubordination. Regiment 561, reorganised on 8th. March, still 
refused to march. 'We will not fight against our brothers from the same 
"stanltsas"<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a>', they proclaimed.</p>

<p class="fst">Small groups of Red Army men surrendered to the rebels and 
started fighting on their side. Witnesses described how some units lost half 
their men before even entering the line of fire of the insurgents. They were 
being machined gunned from the rear 'to prevent them surrendering to the 
rebels'.</p>

<p class="fst">Official sources described how issues of the Kronstadt '<a href="../../../history/ussr/events/kronstadt/izvestia/index.htm">Izvestia</a>' 
were being read with great interest in the Red Army. So were the leaflets 
distributed by the Kronstadt rebels. Special political commissions were set up 
to prevent such material from entering the barracks. But this had an opposite 
effect from the one expected.</p>

<p class="fst">Party organisations throughout the country were mobilised. 
Intensive propaganda was carried out among the troops in the rear. The human and 
material resources available to the Government were far greater than those 
available to Kronstadt. Trains were daily bringing new troops to Petrograd. Many 
were being sent from the Kirghiz and Bachkir lands (i.e., were composed of men 
as far removed as possible from the 'Kronstadt frame of mind'). As to the 
defenders of Kronstadt, their forces were not only diminishing numerically 
(through losses sustained in fighting), but they were more and more exhausted. 
Badly clad and half starving, the Kronstadt rebels remained at their guns, 
almost without relief, for just over a week. At the end of this period, many of 
them could hardly stand.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h18">7. The Final Assault</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Aware of these facts and having taken all necessary measures in 
relation to organisation, supplies and improvement in morale Toukhatchevsky, 
commander of the 7th. Army, issued his famous proclamation of 15th. March. He 
ordered that Kronstadt be taken by all out assault in the night of 16th-17th 
March. Entire regiments of the 7th. Army were equipped with hand grenades, white 
blouses, shears for cutting barbed wire and with small sleighs for carrying 
machine guns.</p>

<p class="fst">Toukhatchevsky's plan was to launch a decisive attack from the 
south, and then to capture Kronstadt by a massive simultaneous assault from 
three different directions.</p>

<p class="fst">On 16th. March, the Southern Group opened its artillery barrage 
at 14.20 hrs. At 17.00 hrs. the Northern Group also started shelling Kronstadt. 
The Kronstadt guns answered back. The bombardment lasted four hours. Aircraft 
then bombed the city, with a view to creating panic among the civilian 
population. In the evening, the artillery bombardment ceased. The Kronstadt 
searchlights swept over the ice looking for the invaders.</p>

<p class="fst">Towards midnight, the Government troops had taken up their 
position and started to advance. At 2:45 a.m., the Northern Force had occupied 
Fort 7, abandoned by the Kronstadt defenders. At 4:30 a.m., Government troops 
attacked Forts 4 and 6, but suffered very heavy losses from the Kronstadt 
artillery. At 6:40 a.m., Government officer cadets finally captured Fort 6.</p>

<p class="fst">At 5:00 a.m., the Southern Force launched an attack on the forts 
facing them. The defenders, overwhelmed, fell back towards the city. A fierce 
and bloody battle then broke out in the streets. Machine guns were used, at very 
close range. The sailors defended each house, each attic, each shed. In the town 
itself, they were reinforced by the workers' militias. The attacking troops 
were, for a few hours, thrown back towards the forts and suburbs. The sailors 
reoccupied the Mechanical Institute, which had been captured early by the 80th 
government Brigade.</p>

<p class="fst">The street fighting was terrible. Red Army soldiers were losing 
their officers, Red Army men and defending troops were mixing in indescribable 
confusion. No one quite knew who was on which side. The civilian population of 
the town tried to fraternise with the Government troops, despite the shooting. 
Leaflets of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee were still being 
distributed. To the bitter end the sailors were trying to fraternise.</p>

<p class="fst">Throughout 17th. March the fighting raged on. By the evening the 
Northern Group had occupied most of the forts. Street fighting continued 
throughout the night and well into the following morning. One by one the last 
forts&#8212;Milioutine, Constantine and Obroutchev&#8212;fell. Even after the last one had 
been occupied, isolated groups of defenders were still desperately fighting back 
with machine guns. Near the Tolbukhin light house, a final group of 150 sailors 
put up a desperate resistance.</p>

<h4><a name="h19">The Balance Sheet</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Figures Issued by the Military Health Authorities of the 
Petrograd District&#8212;and relating to the period between 3rd. and 21st. March&#8212;spoke 
of 4,127 wounded and 527 killed. These figures do not include the drowned, or 
the numerous wounded left to die on the ice.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> Nor do they include the victims 
of the Revolutionary Tribunals.</p>

<p class="fst">We do not even have approximate figures as to the losses on the 
Kronstadt side. They were enormous, even without the reprisal massacres that 
later took place. Perhaps one day the archives of the Tcheka and of the 
Revolutionary Tribunals will reveal the full and terrible truth.</p>

<p class="fst">This is what Poukhov, 'official' Stalinist historian of the 
revolt, says on the matter: 'While steps were being taken to re-establish normal 
life, and as the struggle against rebel remnants was being pursued, the 
Revolutionary Tribunals of the Petrograd Military District were carrying out 
their work in many areas'.....' Severe proletarian justice was being meted out 
to all traitors to the Cause '.....' The sentences were given much publicity in 
the press and played a great educational role'. These quotations from official 
sources refute Trotskyist lies that 'the fortress was surrounded and captured 
with insignificant losses.'<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the night of 17th-18th March, part of the Provisional 
Revolutionary Committee left Kronstadt. Some 8,000 people (some sailors and the 
most active part of the civilian population), moved towards Finland and 
permanent exile. When the Red Army&#8212;defenders of the 'soviet' power&#8212;finally 
entered Kronstadt, they did not re-establish the Kronstadt soviet. Its functions 
were taken over by the Political Section of the Secretariat of the new Assistant 
Commander of the Fortress.</p>

<p class="fst">The whole Red Fleet was profoundly reorganised. Thousands of 
Baltic sailors were sent to serve in the Black Sea, in the Caspian and in 
Siberian naval stations. According to Poukhov: 'the less reliable elements, 
those infected with the Kronstadt spirit, were transferred. Many only went 
reluctantly. This measure contributed to the purification of an unhealthy 
atmosphere'.</p>

<p class="fst">In April, the new Naval Command started an individual check. 'A 
special commission dismissed 15,000 sailors in "non essential" (i.e., non 
specialised) categories V, G, and D&#8212;as well as sailors not considered reliable 
from a political point of view'.</p>

<p class="fst">After the physical annihilation of Kronstadt, its very spirit had 
to be eradicated from the Fleet.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<h3><a name="h20">8. What they said at the time</a></h3>

<p class="quoteb">"Revolts by workers and peasants have shown that their 
patience has come to an end. The uprising of the workers is near at hand. The 
time has come to overthrow the bureaucracy... Kronstadt has raised for the first 
time the banner of the Third Revolution of the toilers... The autocracy has 
fallen. The Constituent Assembly has departed to the region of the damned. The 
bureaucracy is crumbling..." Isvestia of the Kronstadt Provisional Revolutionary Committee. 
Etapy Revoliutsi (Stages of the Revolution), March 12, 1921.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In the bourgeois newspapers you can read that we brought up 
Chinese, Kalmuk and other regiments against Yudemitch and Kronstadt. This is, of 
course, a lie. We brought up our youth. The storming of Kronstadt was indeed 
symbolic. Kronstadt, as I said, was about to pass into the hands of French and 
English imperialism." L. Trotsky. Speech delivered at 2nd Congress of Communist Youtb International, July 14, 1921. The First Five Years of The Communist 
International (Pioneer Publishers, 1945), p. 312.</p>

<h4><a name="h21">The Anarchists</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Did the Kronstadt sailors put forward their demands and 
resolutions by themselves? Or were they acting under the influence of political 
groups, which might have suggested slogans to them? Anarchist influence is often 
incriminated when this subject is described. How sure can one be of the matter? 
Among members of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee, as among the 
Kronstadters in general, there were certainly individuals claiming to be 
anarchists. But if one bases oneself on documentary evidence, as we have sought 
to do throughout this study, one must conclude that there was no direct 
intervention by anarchist groups.</p>

<p class="fst">The Menshevik Dan, who was in prison for a while in Petrograd 
with a group of Kronstadt rebels, tells us in his memoirs<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> that Perepelkin, 
one of the members of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee, was close to 
anarchism. He also tells us that the Kronstadt sailors were both disillusioned 
and fed up with Communist Party policy and that they spoke with hatred about 
political parties in general. In their eyes, the Mensheviks and the Socialist 
Revolutionaries were as bad as the Bolsheviks. All were out to seize power and 
would later betray the people who had vested their confidence in them. According 
to Dan, the conclusion of the sailors, disappointed with political parties was: 
"You are all the same. What we need is anarchism, not a power structure!".</p>

<p class="fst">The anarchists of course defend the Kronstadt rebels. It seems 
likely to us that had any of their organisations really lent a hand in the 
insurrection the anarchist press would have mentioned the fact. In the anarchist 
press of the time, however, there is no mention of such help. For instance 
Yartchouk, an old anarcho-syndicalist<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> who before October had enjoyed 
considerable authority amongst the population and sailors of Kronstadt, mentions 
no such anarchist role in his pamphlet devoted to the 1921 uprising<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a>, written 
immediately after the events. We must consider his judgement as fairly 
conclusive evidence.</p>

<p class="fst">At the time of the insurrection the anarchists were already being 
persecuted all over the country. Isolated libertarians and the few remaining 
anarchist groupings were undoubtedly 'morally' on the side of the insurgents. 
This is shown for instance in the following leaflet, addressed to the working 
class of Petrograd:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The Kronstadt revolt is a revolution. Day and night you can hear 
the sound of the cannon. You hesitate to intervene directly against the 
Government to divert its forces from Kronstadt, although the cause of Kronstadt 
is your cause... The men of Kronstadt are always in the forefront of rebellion. 
After the Kronstadt revolt let us see the revolt of Petrograd. And after you, 
let anarchism prevail."</p>

<p class="fst">Four anarchists then in Petrograd (Emma Goldmann, Alexander 
Berkman, Perkous and Petrovsky) foresaw a bloody outcome to events. On March 5, 
they sent the following letter to the Petrograd Council for Labour and Defence:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"It Is not only impossible but in fact criminal to keep quiet at 
the present time. Recent developments compel us anarchists to give our opinion 
on the present situation. The discontent and ferment in the minds of the workers 
and sailors are the result of circumstances which deserve serious attention from 
us. Cold and famine have provoked discontent, while the absence of any 
possibility of discussion or criticism drive the workers and sailors to seek an 
outlet to this discontent. The fact that a workers' and peasants' government 
uses force against workers and sailors is even more important. It will create a 
reactionary impression in the international labour movement and will therefore 
harm the cause of the social revolution. Bolshevik comrades, think while there 
is still time. Don't play with fire. You are about to take a decisive step. We 
propose the following to you: nominate a commission of six, of which two should 
be anarchists, to go to Kronstadt to solve the differences peacefully. In the 
present circumstances this is the most rational way of doing things. It will 
have an international revolutionary significance."</p>

<p class="fst">These anarchists certainly did their duty. But they acted on 
their own and there is nothing to show that they were organisationally linked 
with the rebels in any way. Moreover the very fact that they proposed this kind 
of mediation suggests that they were not in direct contact with the sailors, who 
had themselves sent a deputation to Petrograd through which it would have been 
possible to negotiate. And if, in the "Petropavlovsk" resolution, we find the 
demand of freedom of speech and freedom of publication for the anarchists, this 
merely shows that the Kronstadters of 1921 had retained their ideas and 
traditions of before October.</p>

<p class="fst">Before October both Bolsheviks and Anarchists had considerable 
influence at Kronstadt<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a>. In the summer of 1917, at a meeting of the Petrograd 
Soviet, Trotsky had been able to answer the Menshevik leader Tseretelli:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Yes, the Kronstadters are anarchists. But during the final stage 
of the Revolution the reactionaries who are now inciting you to exterminate 
Kronstadt will be preparing ropes to hang both you and us. And it will be the 
Kronstadters who will fight to the last to defend us."</p>

<p class="fst">The anarchists were well-known in Kronstadt as revolutionaries. 
That is why the rebels, when they spoke of opening the doors of the Soviets to 
different socialist tendencies, had first thought of the anarchists as well as 
of the left Socialist Revolutionaries.</p>

<p class="fst">The most important of the demands of the Petropavlovsk resolution 
were those calling for democratic rights for the workers and those peasants not 
exploiting the labour of others and the demand calling for the abolition of the 
monopoly of Party influence. These demands were part of the programme of other 
socialist tendencies, already reduced to illegality. The anarchists agreed with 
these demands and were not the only ones to be putting them forward.</p>

<p class="fst">On the other hand the Kronstadters repeatedly insisted that they 
were "for soviet power". A small minority of Russian libertarians (the 'soviet 
anarchists') were known to support the idea of close collaboration with the 
soviets, which were already integrated into the state machine. The Makhnovist 
movement on the other hand (which was not exclusively anarchist although under 
the strong personal influence of Makhno, an anarchist since the age of 16) did 
not speak of 'soviet power' as some thing to be defended. Its slogan was 'free 
soviets', i.e. soviets where different political tendencies might coexist, 
without being vested with state power.</p>

<p class="fst">The Kronstadters believed that the trade unions had an important 
role to play. This idea was by no means an exclusively anarchist one. It was 
shared by the left Socialist Revolutionaries and by the Workers' Opposition 
(Kollontal and Chliapnikov) in the Communist Party Itself. Later other 
oppositional communist tendencies (like the Sapronovites) were to espouse it. In 
short the idea was the hallmark of all those who sought to save the Russian 
Revolution through proletarian democracy and through an opposition to the 
one-party monopoly which had started dominating and was now replacing all other 
tendencies.</p>

<p class="fst">We may conclude by saying that anarchism had an influence on the 
Kronstadt insurrection to the extent that it advocated the idea of proletarian 
democracy.</p>

<h4><a name="h22">The Mensheviks</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The Mensheviks had never carried much weight among the sailors. 
The number of Menshevik deputies to the Kronstadt Soviet bore no real relation 
to their influence in the Fleet. The anarchists, who after the second election 
only had three or four deputies to the Soviet, enjoyed a far greater popularity. 
This paradoxical situation arose from the lack of organisation among the 
anarchists and also from the fact that in 1917 the differences between 
bolshevism and anarchism were hardly perceptible to the masses. Many anarchists 
at that time saw bolshevism as a kind of Bakouninized Marxism<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a>.</p>

<p class="fst">The Mensheviks&#8212;at least their official faction&#8212;although 
fundamentally hostile to Bolshevism, were not in favour of an armed struggle 
against the State power. Because of this they were hostile to armed 
intervention<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a>. They tried to play the role of a legal opposition both in the 
Soviets and in the trade unions. Opposed both to the dictatorship of the 
proletariat and to the dictatorship of a single party and convinced that a stage 
of capitalist development still confronted Russia, they felt that armed 
interventions would only prevent the democratic forces in Russia from 
establishing themselves. They hoped that once the armed struggle had come to an 
end the regime would be compelled to follow a course of democratic 
transformation.</p>

<p class="fst">On March 7, 1921, during the Kronstadt insurrection, the 
underground Petrograd Committee of the Mensheviks published the following 
leaflet:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"To the workers, red soldiers and Koursantys of Petrograd.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Stop the slaughter! The guns are thundering and the Communists who claim to be a 
Workers Party are shooting the sailors of Kronstadt.</p>

<p class="quoteb">We don't know all the details about what has happened at 
Kronstadt. But we do know that the Kronstadters have called for free elections 
to the soviets and for the release of arrested socialists and of arrested 
non-party workers and soldiers. They have called for the convening, on March 10, 
of a non-party conference of workers, red soldiers and sailors to discuss the 
critical situation of Soviet Russia.</p>

<p class="quoteb">A genuine workers' power should have been able to clarify the 
real causes of the Kronstadt events. It should have discussed things openly with 
the workers and sailors of Kronstadt, in front of the whole of working class 
Russia. Instead, the Bolsheviks have proclaimed a state of siege and have 
machine-gunned the soldiers and sailors.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Comrades, we cannot, we must not just sit and listen to the sound 
of the guns. Each salvo may destroy dozens of human lives. We must intervene and 
put an end to this massacre.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Insist that military operations against the sailors and workers 
of Kronstadt be ended immediately. Insist that the Government start immediate 
negotiations with Kronstadt, with the participation of Petrograd factory 
delegates. Elect delegates forthwith to participate in these discussions. Stop 
the slaughter!"</p>

<p class="fst">The Central Committee of the Mensheviks had also published a 
leaflet. This proclaimed that "what was necessary was not a policy of violence 
towards the peasantry but a policy of conciliation towards it. Power should 
really be in the hands of the working masses. To this end new and free elections 
to the soviets were essential. What was needed was that Workers' Democracy, much 
talked about but of which one couldn't see the slightest trace."</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Sozialistitchenski Vestnik</i>, the official organ of Russian 
Social Democracy (published abroad) assessed the Kronstadt insurrection as 
follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"It is precisely the masses themselves, who until now had 
supported bolshevism, who have now taken the initiative in a decisive struggle 
against the present regime". The paper considered the Kronstadt slogans to be 
Menshevik ones and added that Mensheviks "had all the greater right to be 
pleased about it, in view of the fact that their party had played no role in the 
insurrection, given the total lack of any Menshevik organisation in the Fleet".</p>

<p class="fst">Martov, the leader of Russian Menshevism was already out of 
Russia. In an article in <i>Freiheit</i>, published on May 1st 1921, he denied 
that either Mensheviks or Social Revolutionaries had played any part in the 
insurrection. The initiative, he felt, was coming from the sailors who were 
breaking with the Communist Party at the organisational level, but not at the 
level of principles.</p>

<p class="fst">Poukhov quotes another leaflet signed by one of the numerous 
groups of Mensheviks. It said: "Down with the lies of the Counter Revolution! 
Where are the real counter-revolutionaries? They are the Bolsheviks, the 
commissars. those who speak of 'soviet power'. Against them the real Revolution 
is rising up. We must support it. We must come to the rescue of Kronstadt. Our 
duty is to help Kronstadt. long live the Revolution. Long live the Constituent 
Assembly!" The Menshevik Central Committee declined all responsibility for 
slogans put forward by such dissident groupings.</p>

<h4><a name="h23">The right S.R.S.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">The call for the convening of the Constituent Assembly was the 
central theme of the propaganda of the Right wing Socialist Revolutionaries. In 
<i>Revolutzionaia Rossia</i>, their Party organ (which in March 1921 was being 
published abroad) Victor Tchernov. ex-president of the dissolved Constituent 
Assembly and leader of the Right S.R.s. wrote: "All those who want to find a way 
out of the disgusting, bloodstained Bolshevik dictatorship, all those who wish 
to tread the path of freedom must stand up around Kronstadt and come to its 
help. The crown of democracy must be the Constituent Assembly".</p>

<p class="fst">Now Tchernov was fully aware that in No. 6 of the <i>Kronstadt 
Isvestia</i> the rebel sailors had written "The workers and peasants will go 
forward. <i>They will leave behind them the Utchred-Nika</i> (pejorative form 
for the Constituent Assembly) <i>and its bourgeois regime</i>. <i>They will also 
leave behind them the Communist Party dictatorship with its tchekas and its 
State Capitalism</i>, which has seized the masses by the throat and is 
threatening to throttle them". When Tchernov discussed these lines of the 
Kronstadters he attributed them to an ideological survival of past Bolshevik 
influence.</p>

<p class="fst">By personal and political temperament, Tchernov was diametrically 
opposed to the Mensheviks. With his political friends he launched a passionate 
appeal to the sailors.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The Bolsheviks killed the cause of liberty and democracy when 
they counterpoised, in the popular mind, the idea of soviets to the idea of the 
Constituent Assembly. Instead of seeing the soviets as a support for the 
Constituent Assembly, as a powerful link between the Assembly and the country, 
they raised the soviets against the Assembly and thereby killed both the soviets 
and the Assembly. This is what you must understand, deceived workers, soldiers, 
and sailors. Let your slogan 'free elections to the soviets' reverberate, as a 
call to a march from the soviets to the Constituent Assembly."</p>

<p class="fst">Tchernov went even further. From a private ship he sent the 
following radio message to the Provisional Revolutionary Committee:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The President of the Constituent Assembly, Victor Tchernov, 
sends fraternal greetings to the heroic sailor, soldier and worker comrades who, 
for the third time since 1905, are shaking off the yoke of tyranny. Acting as an 
intermediary, he proposes, with the help of Russian co-operative organisations 
now abroad, to send men to ensure the feeding of Kronstadt. Let me know what you 
need and how much you need. I am prepared to come personally and to place both 
my forces and my authority at the disposal of the popular revolution. I have 
confidence in the final victory of the working people. From every corner we are 
receiving news that the masses are ready and willing to rise in the name of the 
Constituent Assembly. Don't be trapped into negotiations with the Bolsheviks. 
They will only enter into such negotiations in order to gain time and to 
concentrate around Kronstadt those formations of the privileged soviet military 
corps of which they can be sure. Glory to those who were the first to raise the 
flag of popular liberation. Down with the despotism of both right and left. Long 
live liberty and democracy."</p>

<p class="quoteb">At the same time a second appeal was sent to Kronstadt by special 
courier, from the 'deputation abroad of the Socialist Revolutionary Party':</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The Party has abstained from any type of putchism. In Russia it 
has lately put the brakes on the upsurges of popular anger while frequently 
trying, through the pressure of worker and peasant opinion, to compel the 
Kremlin dictators to concede to the demands of the people. But now that popular 
anger has overflowed, now that the flag of popular revolution has been proudly 
hoisted over Kronstadt, our Party is offering the rebels the help of all the 
forces it can muster in the struggle for liberty and democracy. The S.R.s are 
prepared to share your fate and to win or die in your ranks. Let us know how we 
can help you. Long live the people's revolution. Long live free soviets and the 
Constituent Assembly!"</p>

<p class="fst">To these concrete proposals, Tchernov received, on March 3 1921, 
the following answer by radio:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The Provisional Revolutionary Committee of the city of Kronstadt 
has received the greetings of comrade Tchernov, despatched from Reval. To all 
our brothers abroad we express our gratitude for their sympathy. We thank 
Comrade Tchernov for suggestions but ask him not to come for the time being 
until the matter has been clarified. For the time being we are noting his 
proposal.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Signed: Petrichenko President of the Provisional Revolutionary 
Committee."</p>

<p class="fst">The Bolsheviks claim that the Provisional Revolutionary Committee 
consented in principle to Tchernov's arrival. They also claim that Tchernov made 
his offer to send provisions to Kronstadt conditional on the rebels launching 
the slogan of the Constituent Assembly. On March 20, 1921 the communist Komarov 
declared at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet that the Provisional Revolutionary 
Committee had asked Tchernov to wait for 12 days during which time the food 
situation in Kronstadt would have become such that it would be possible to 
launch the slogan asked for by the S.R.s. Komarov claimed that this information 
had been obtained in the course of the cross-questioning of Perepelkin a member 
of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee who had fallen into Bolshevik hands. 
Perepelkin was even alleged to have said that the President of the Provisional 
Revolutionary Committee had secretly sent a positive answer to Tchernov.</p>

<p class="fst">The sailor Perepelkin was shot and his 'confessions' cannot be 
verified. But in prison, just before, he had met the Menshevik Dan and had 
mentioned no such thing to him although during their joint exercise periods 
Perepelkin had provided Dan with many details concerning the insurrection. One 
is led to believe that already in 1921, Bolshevik 'justice' knew how to concoct 
confessions.</p>

<p class="fst">In an article published in January 1926, in <i>Znamia Borby</i>, 
organ of the left S.R.s, Petrichenko, President of the Provisional Revolutionary 
Committee, confirms the answer given to Tchernov by the committee. He explains 
that the Committee itself could not deal with this question. It proposed to hand 
the problem over to the newly elected soviet. Petrichenko adds "I am describing 
things as they took place in reality and independent of my own political 
opinion". As for Tchernov, he denies having posed conditions for the rebels. He 
claims openly to have supported the slogan of the Constituent Assembly, 
"convinced that sooner or later the rebels would have adopted it".</p>

<h4><a name="h24">The left S.R.S.</a></h4>

<p class="fst">In the June 1921 issue of their paper <i>Znamia</i> published 
abroad, this is how the left S.R.s. outlined their programme:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The essential aim of the left (internationalist) S.R. Party is 
the reconstitution of the soviets and the restoration of genuine Soviet 
power.... We are aiming at the permanent re-establishment of the violated 
Constitution of the Soviet Republic, as adopted on June 10, 1918, at the Fifth 
All-Russian Congress of Soviets.... the peasantry, which is the backbone of the 
working population in Russia, should have the right to dispose of its fate.... 
another essential demand is the re-establishment of the self-activity and of the 
free initiative of the workers in the cities. Intensive labour cannot be 
demanded of men who are starving and half dead. First they must be fed and to 
this end it is essential to co-ordinate the interests of workers and peasants."</p>

<p class="fst">The spirit of the "<i>Petropavlovsk</i>" Resolution is 
undoubtedly very close to that of the left S.R. programme. The left S.R.s, 
however, deny participation in the insurrection. In the same issue of <i>Znamia</i> 
one of their Moscow correspondents writes: "At Kronstadt, there wasn't a single 
responsible representative of left populism. The whole movement developed 
without our participation. At the onset we were outside of it but it was 
nevertheless essentially left populist in outlook. Its slogans and its moral 
objectives are very close to our own".</p>

<p class="fst">In the wish to establish historical truth we will now quote two 
further authorised testimonies, that of Lenin and that of the sailor 
Petrichenko, one of the leaders of the insurrection.</p>

<h4><a name="h25">Lenin's Views</a></h4>

<p class="fst">In his article "The Tax in Kind"<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> this is what Lenin has to 
say about Kronstadt:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In the spring of 1921, mainly as a result of the failure of the 
harvest and the dying of cattle, the condition of the peasantry, which was 
extremely bad already as a consequence of the war and blockade, became very much 
worse. This resulted in political vacillation which, generally speaking, 
expresses the very 'nature' of the small producer. The most striking expression 
of this vacillation was the Kronstadt mutiny.... There was very little of 
anything that was fully formed, clear and definite. We heard nebulous slogans 
about 'liberty', 'free trade', 'emancipation from serfdom', 'Soviets without the 
Bolsheviks', or new elections to the Soviets, or relief from 'party 
dictatorship", and so on and so forth. Both the Mensheviks and the 
Socialist-Revolutionaries declared the Kronstadt movement to be 'their own'.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Victor Chernov sent a runner to Kronstadt: on the proposal of 
this runner, the Menshevik Valk, one of the Kronstadt leaders, voted for the '<i>Constituent</i>.' 
In a flash, with radio-telegraphic speed, one might say, the White Guards 
mobilised all their forces '<i>for Kronstadt</i>'. The White Guard military 
experts in Kronstadt, a number of experts, and not Kozlovsky alone, drew up a 
plan for a landing of forces at Oranienbaum, a plan which frightened the 
vacillating Menshevik-Socialist-Revolutionary non-party masses.</p>

<p class="quoteb">More than fifty Russian White Guard newspapers published abroad 
are conducting a furious campaign 'for Kronstadt'. The big banks, all the forces 
of finance capital, are collecting funds to assist Kronstadt. The wise leader of 
the bourgeoisie and the landlords, the Cadet Milyukov, is patiently explaining 
to the fool Victor Chernov directly (and to Dan and Rozhkov who are in Petrograd 
jail for their connection with the Kronstadt Mensheviks, indirectly) that they 
need be in no hurry with their Constituent, and that they <i>can and must 
support the Soviets only without the Bolsheviks</i>.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Of course, it is easy to be cleverer than conceited fools like 
Chernov, the hero of petty-bourgeois phrases, or like Martov, the knight of 
philistine reformism painted to look like 'Marxism'. Properly speaking, the 
point is not that Milyukov, as an individual, is cleverer, but that because of 
his class position the party leader of the big bourgeoisie sees, understands the 
class essence and political interaction of things more clearly than the leaders 
of the petty bourgeoisie, the Chernovs and Martovs. The bourgeoisie is really a 
class force which inevitably rules under capitalism, both under a monarchy and 
in the most democratic republic, and which also inevitably enjoys the support of 
the world bourgeoisie.</p>

<p class="quoteb">But the petty bourgeoisie. i.e.. all the heroes of the Second 
International and of the 'Two-and-a-Half' International, cannot, by the very 
economic nature of the case, be anything else than the expression of class 
impotence; hence the vacillation, phrases and helplessness....</p>

<p class="quoteb">When in his Berlin Journal Martov declared that Kronstadt not 
only adopted Menshevik slogans but also proved that an anti-Bolshevik movement 
was possible which did not entirely serve the interests of the White Guards, the 
capitalists and the landlords, he served as an example of a conceited philistine 
Narcissus. He said in effect: 'Let us close our eyes to the fact that all the 
real White Guards greeted the Kronstadt mutineers and through the banks 
collected funds in aid of Kronstadt!' Kilyukov is right compared with the 
Chernovs and Martovs, for he proposes real tactics for a real White Guard Force, 
the force of the capitalists and landlords. He says in effect: 'It does not 
matter whom we support, even the anarchists, any sort of Soviet government, 
<i>as long as</i> the Bolsheviks are overthrown, <i>as long as shifting of power</i> 
can be brought about! It makes no difference, to the Right or to the Left, to 
the Mensheviks or to the anarchists, as long as power shifts away from the 
Bolsheviks.' As for the rest&#8212;'we', the Milyukovs, we shall give the anarchists, 
the Chernovs and the Martovs a good slapping and kick them out as was done to 
Chernov and Maisky in Siberia, to the Hungarian Chernovs and Martovs in Hungary, 
to Kautsky in Germany and Friedrich Adler and Co. in Vienna. The real, practical 
bourgeoisie fooled hundreds of these philistine Narcissuses: the Mensheviks, 
Socialist-Revolutionaries and non-party people, and kicked them out scores of 
times in all revolutions in all countries. This is proved by history. It is 
corroborated by facts. The Narcissuses will chatter; the Milyukovs and White 
Guards will act....</p>

<p class="quoteb">The events of the spring of 1921 once again revealed the role of 
the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks: they are helping the vacillating 
petty-bourgeois element to recoil from the Bolsheviks, to cause a 'shifting of 
power' for the benefit of the capitalists and landlords. The Mensheviks and 
Socialist-Revolutionaries have now learnt to disguise themselves as 
'non-party'."</p>

<h4><a name="h26">Petrichenko's Evidence</a></h4>

<p class="fst">We will finally quote the main passages of Petrichenko's 
evidence, as published in his article in the left S.R. paper <i>Znamia Borby</i>, 
In January 1926:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"I have read the letters exchanged between the left S.R. 
organisation and the British Communists. In this correspondence the question of 
the Kronstadt insurrection of 1921 is raised...</p>

<p class="quoteb">As I was the President [of the Provisional Revolutionary 
Committee] I feel it a moral obligation briefly to throw some light on these 
events for the benefit of the Political Bureau of the British Communist Party. I 
know you get your information from Moscow. I also know that this information is 
one-sided and biased. It wouldn't be a bad thing if you were shown the other 
side of the coin....</p>

<p class="quoteb">You have yourselves admitted that the Kronstadt insurrection of 
1921 was not inspired from the outside. This recognition implies that the 
patience of the working masses, sailors, red soldiers, workers and peasants had 
reached its final limit.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Popular anger against the dictatorship of the Communist Party&#8212;or 
rather against its bureaucracy&#8212;took the form of an insurrection. This is how 
precious blood came to be spilt. There was no question of class or caste 
differences. There were workers on both sides of the barricades. The difference 
lay in the fact that the men of Kronstadt marched forward consciously and of 
their own free will, while those who were attacking them had been misled by the 
Communist Party leaders and some were even acting against their own wishes. I 
can tell you even more: the Kronstadters didn't enjoy taking up arms and 
spilling blood!</p>

<p class="quoteb">What happened then to force the Kronstadters to speak the 
language of guns with the Communist Party bosses, daring to call themselves a 
'Workers and Peasants Government'?</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Kronstadt sailors had taken an active part in the creation 
of such a government. They had protected it against all the attacks of the 
Counter-revolution. They not only protected the gates of Petrograd&#8212;the heart of 
the world revolution&#8212;but they also formed military detachments for the 
innumerable fronts against the White Guards, starting with Kornilov and 
finishing with Generals Youdienitch and Neklioudov.</p>

<p class="quoteb">You are asked to believe that these same Kronstadters had 
suddenly become the enemies of the Revolution. The 'Workers and Peasants' 
Government denounced the Kronstadt rebels as agents of the Entente, as French 
spies, as supporters of the bourgeoisie, as S.R.s, as Mensheviks, etc., etc. It 
is astounding that the men of Kronstadt should suddenly have become dangerous 
enemies just when real danger from the generals of the armed counter-revolution 
had disappeared&#8212;just when the rebuilding of the country had to be tackled&#8212;just 
when people were thinking of tasting the fruits of October&#8212;just when it was a 
question of showing the goods in their true colour, of showing one's political 
baggage (i.e. when it was no longer a question of making promises but of 
sticking to them). People were beginning to draw up a balance sheet of 
revolutionary achievements. We hadn't dared dream about this during the Civil 
War. Yet it is just at this point in time that the men of Kronstadt were found 
to be enemies. What crime had Kronstadt, therefore, committed against the 
revolution?</p>

<p class="quoteb">As the Civil War subsided, the Petrograd workers thought it 
their right to remind the Soviet of that town that the time had come to remember 
their economic plight and to pass from a war regime to a regime of peace.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Petrograd Soviet considered this harmless and essential 
demand to be counter-revolutionary. It not only remained deaf and dumb to these 
claim but it started resorting to home searches and arrests of workers, 
declaring them spies and agents of the Entente. These bureaucrats became corrupt 
during the Civil War at a time when no one dared resist them. They hadn't 
noticed that the situation had changed.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The workers answered by resorting to strikes. The fury of the 
Petrograd Soviet then became like the fury of a wild animal. Assisted by Its 
Opritchniks<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> it kept the workers hungry and exhausted. It held them in an 
iron grip, driving them to work by all kinds of constraint. The Red soldiers and 
sailors, despite their sympathy with the workers, didn't dare rise in their 
defence. But this time the 'workers' and 'peasants' Government came unstuck 
about Kronstadt. Somewhat belatedly Kronstadt had learned about the true state 
of affairs in Petrograd.</p>

<p class="quoteb">You are therefore right, British comrades, when you say that the 
Kronstadt revolt was not the result of the activities of any one particular 
person.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Furthermore I would like you to know more about the alleged 
support to Kronstadt of counter-revolutionary foreign and Russian organisations! 
I repeat again that the uprising was not provoked by any political organisation. 
I doubt they even existed at Kronstadt. The revolt broke out spontaneously. It 
expressed the wishes of the masses themselves, both the civilian population and 
the garrison. This is seen in the resolutions adopted and in the composition of 
the Provisional Revolutionary Committee, where one cannot detect the dominant 
influence of any anti-soviet party. According to the Kronstadters any thing that 
happened or was done there was dictated by the circumstances of the moment. The 
rebels didn't place their faith in anyone. They didn't even place it in the 
hands of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee or in the hands of the 
assemblies of delegates, or in the hands of meetings, or anywhere else. There 
was no question about this. The Provisional Revolutionary Committee never 
attempted anything in this direction, although it could have done. The 
Committee's only concern was strictly to implement the wishes of the people. Was 
that a good thing or a bad thing? I cannot pass judgement.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The truth is that the masses led the Committee and not the other 
way round. Among us there were no well-known political figures, of the kind who 
see everything three archines<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> deep and know all that needs to be done, and 
how to get the most out of every situation. The Kronstadters acted without 
predetermined plans or programme, feeling their way according to circumstances 
and within the context of the resolutions they had adopted. We were cut off from 
the entire world. We didn't know what was going on outside Kronstadt, either in 
Russia or abroad. Some may possibly have drawn up their own blueprints for our 
insurrection as usually happens. They were wasting their time. It is fruitless 
to speculate as to what would have happened if things had evolved differently, 
for the turn of events itself might have been quite different from what we were 
anticipating. One thing is certain, the Kronstadters didn't want the initiative 
to pass out of their hands.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In their publications the Communists accuse us of accepting an 
offer of food and medicine from the Russian Red Cross, in Finland. We admit we 
saw nothing wrong in accepting such an offer. Both the Provisional Revolutionary 
Committee and the assembly of delegates agreed to it. We felt that the Red Cross 
was a philanthropic organisation, offering us disinterested help that could do 
us no harm. When we decided to allow the Red Cross delegation to enter Kronstadt 
we lead them blindfolded to our head-quarters. At our first meeting we informed 
them that we gratefully accepted their offer of help as coming from a 
philanthropic organisation, but that we considered ourselves free of any 
undertakings towards them. We accepted their request to leave a permanent 
representative in Kronstadt, to watch over the regular distribution to women and 
children of the rations which they were proposing to send us.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Their representative, a retired naval officer called Vilken, 
remained in Kronstadt. He was put in a permanently guarded flat and couldn't 
even step outside without our permission. What danger could this man have 
represented? All he could see was the resolve of the garrison and of the 
civilian population of Kronstadt.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Was this the 'aid of the international bourgeoisie'? Or did this 
aid perhaps lie in the fact that Victor Tchernov had sent us his greetings? Was 
this the 'support of both the Russian and international counter-revolution'? Can 
you really believe that the men of Kronstadt were ready to throw themselves into 
the embrace of any anti-soviet party? Remember that when the rebels learned that 
the right wing was beginning to devise plans about their insurrection they 
didn't hesitate to warn the workers about it. Remember the article of March 6 in 
the Kronstadt Isvestia, entitled 'gentlemen or comrades'."</p>

<h3><a name="h27">9. Kronstadt: last upsurge of the Soviets</a></h3>

<p class="quoteb">"... this luxury was really absolutely impermissible. By 
permitting (sic!) such a discussion (on the trade unions) we undoubtedly made a 
mistake and failed to see that in this discussion a question came to the 
forefront which, because of the objective conditions, should not have been in 
the forefront ..." Lenin. Report to 10th Party Congress, March 8, 1921. Selected 
Works, Vol. IX, p. 90.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"What the rebels of Kronstadt demanded was only what Trotsky had 
promised their elder brothers and what he and the Party had been unable to give. 
Once again a bitter and hostile echo of his own voice came back to him from the 
lips of other people, and once again he had to suppressed it." Isaac Deutscher, 
The Prophet Armed, p. 512-3</p>

<h4><a name="h28">Trotsky's Accusations</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Taking everything into account, what was the Kronstadt uprising? 
Was it a counter-revolutionary insurrection? Was it a revolt without conscious 
counter-revolutionary objectives, but which was bound to open the doors to the 
counter-revolution? Or was it simply an attempt by the working masses to 
materialise some of the promise of October? Was the revolt inevitable? And was 
the bloody end to which it came also inevitable? We will conclude by trying to 
answer these questions.</p>

<p class="fst">The accusations made against Kronstadt by the Bolsheviks in 1921 
are exactly the same as those mentioned later by the Stalinist historian 
Poukhov, in his book published in 1931. Trotsky repeated them. The trotskyists 
still repeat them today.</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky's attitude on this question was however always somewhat 
embarrassed and awkward. He would issue his accusations by the dropper instead 
of proclaiming them once and for all. In 1937, when he discussed Kronstadt for 
the first time in writing (in his books on the Russian Revolution he hardly ever 
dealt with the subject) he starts by saying that "The country was hungry, and 
the Kronstadt sailors were demanding privileges. The mutiny was motivated by 
their wish for privileged nations."<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> Such a demand was never put forward by 
the men of Kronstadt. In his later writings Trotsky, having doubtless taken care 
to read more on the matter, was to abandon this particular accusation. What 
remains, however, is that he started his public accusations with a lie.</p>

<p class="fst">In an article in the Belgian paper Lutte Ouvriere (February 26, 
1938) Trotsky wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"From a class point of view, which&#8212;no offence to the 
eclectics&#8212;remains the fundamental criterion both in politics and in history, it 
is extremely important to compare the conduct of Kronstadt with that of 
Petrograd during these critical days. In Petrograd too the whole leading stratum 
of the working class had been skimmed off. Famine and cold reigned in the 
abandoned capital, even more cruelly than in Moscow... The paper of the 
Kronstadt rebels spoke of barricades in Petrograd, of thousands of people 
killed.<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> The Press of the whole world was announcing the same thing. In fact 
the exact opposite took place. The Kronstadt uprising did not attract the 
workers of Petrograd. It repelled them. The demarcation took place along class 
lines. The workers immediately felt that the Kronstadt rebels were on the other 
side of the barricade and they gave their support to the Government."</p>

<p class="fst">Here again Trotsky is saying things which are quite untrue. 
Earlier on we showed how the wave of strikes had started in Petrograd and how 
Kronstadt had followed suit. It was against the strikers of Petrograd that the 
Government had to organise a special General Staff: the Committee of Defence. 
The repression was first directed against the Petrograd workers and against 
their demonstrations, by the despatch of armed detachments of Koursantys.<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But the workers of Petrograd had no weapons. They could not 
defend themselves as could the Kronstadt sailors. The military repression 
directed against Kronstadt certainly intimidated the Petrograd workers. The 
demarcation did not take place "along class lines" but according to the 
respective strengths of the organs of repression. The fact that the workers of 
Petrograd did not follow those of Kronstadt does not prove that they did not 
sympathise with them. Nor, at a later date, when the Russian proletariat failed 
to follow the various "oppositions" did this prove that they were in agreement 
with Stalin! In such instances it was a question of the respective strengths of 
the forces confronting one another.</p>

<p class="fst">In the same article Trotsky repeats his points concerning the 
exhaustion of Kronstadt, from the revolutionary point of view. He claims that, 
whereas the Kronstadt sailors of 1917 and 1918 were ideologically at a much 
higher level than the Red Army, the contrary was the case by 1921. This argument 
is refuted by official Red Army documents. These admit that the frame of mind of 
Kronstadt had infected large layers of the army.</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky denounces those who attack him over Kronstadt over the 
belatedness of their strictures. "The campaign around Kronstadt" he says "is 
conducted, in certain places, with unrelenting energy. One might imagine that 
events took place yesterday and not seventeen years ago" But seventeen years is 
a very short period, on any historical scale. We don't accept that to speak of 
Kronstadt is to "evoke the days of the Egyptian Pharaohs". Moreover it appears 
logical to us to seek some of the roots of the great Russian catastrophe in this 
striking and symptomatic episode. After all it took place at a time when the 
repression of the Russian workers was not being perpetrated by some Stalin or 
other but by the flower of Bolshevism, by Lenin and Trotsky themselves. 
Seriously to discuss the Kronstadt revolt is therefore not, as Trotsky claims, 
"to be interested in discrediting the only genuinely revolutionary tendency, the 
only tendency never to have reneged its flag, never to have compromised with the 
enemy, the only tendency to represent the future".</p>

<p class="fst">During the subsequent seventeen years Trotsky shed none of his 
hostility towards the rebels. Lacking arguments he resorts to gossip. He tells 
us that "at Kronstadt, where the garrison was doing nothing and only living on 
its past, demoralisation had reached important proportions. When the situation 
became particularly difficult in famished Petrograd, the Political Bureau 
discussed several times whether to raise an internal loan in Kronstadt, where 
there still remained old stores of all sorts. But the Petrograd delegates would 
answer: 'They will give us nothing of their own free will. They speculate on 
cloth, coal, bread, for in Kronstadt all the old scum has raised its head 
again!".</p>

<p class="fst">This argument concerning "old stores of all sorts" is in bad 
faith. One need only recall the ultimatum to the Kronstadters issued by the 
Petrograd Defence Committee on March 5th (referred to elsewhere): "You will be 
obliged to surrender. Kronstadt has neither bread nor fuel". What had happened 
in the meantime to the said old stories</p>

<p class="fst">Further information on this topic comes from the <i>Kronstadt Ivestia</i>. It describes the distribution to children of one pound of dried 
potatoes on presentation of ration vouchers 5 and 6. On March 8th, four litres 
of oats were distributed to last four days&#8212;and on March 9th a quarter of a pound 
of black biscuit made of flour and dried potato powder. On March 10th the 
Regional Committee of Metalworkers decided to place at the disposal of the 
community the horse meat to which its members were entitled. During the 
insurrection there was also distributed a tin of condensed milk per person, on 
one occasion some meat preserves, and finally (to children only), half a pound 
of butter.</p>

<p class="fst">That no doubt is what Trotsky refers to as "old stores of all 
sorts"! According to him these might have been borrowed to alleviate the great 
Russian famine. We should add that before the insurrection these "stores" were 
in the hands of communist functionaries and that it was upon these people alone 
that consent to the proposed "loan" depended. The rank and file sailor, who took 
part in the insurrection, had no means open to him whereby he could have opposed 
the loan, even if he had wanted to. So much for the question of "stores"&#8212;which 
in passing shows the worth of some of the accusations used against Kronstadt.</p>

<p class="fst">To resort to such arguments in the course of a serious discussion 
(and consciously to substitute for such a discussion a polemic about the Spanish 
Revolution) shows up a serious flaw: the absence of valid arguments on the 
matter among the Bolsheviks (for Trotsky isn't the central figure in the 
repression of Kronstadt. Lenin and the Politbureau directed the whole operation. 
The Workers' Opposition must also shoulder its share of responsibility. 
According to the personal testimony of foreign Communists residing in Russia at 
the time, the Workers' Opposition didn't agree with the measures being taken 
against the rebels. But neither did it dare open its mouth for the defence of 
Kronstadt. At the 10th Party Congress no one protested at the butchery of the 
rebels. The worker Lutovinov, a well known member of the Central Executive 
Committee of the Soviets and one of the leaders of the Workers Opposition, was 
sent to Berlin in March 1921 on a diplomatic mission (in reality this was a form 
of political exile). He declared that: 'The news published abroad concerning the 
Kronstadt events was greatly exaggerated. The Soviet Government is strong enough 
to finish off the rebels. The slowness of the operation is to be explained by 
the fact that we wish to spare the population of Kronstadt". ('L'Humanite'. 
March 18, 1921)<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky uses yet another argument against the rebels: he accuses 
them of seeking to take advantage of their revolutionary past. This is a most 
dangerous argument for anyone in opposition. Stalin was to use it against 
Trotsky and the old Bolshevik. It was only later that Stalin accused them of 
having been, from the very beginning of the Revolution, the agents of the 
international bourgeoisie. During the first years of the struggle he conceded 
that Trotsky had rendered great services to the Revolution but he would add that 
Trotsky had subsequently passed into the ranks of the counter-revolution. One 
had to judge a man on what he did now. The example of Mussolini was constantly 
mentioned.</p>

<p class="fst">However, there are many things that Trotsky is unable to explain. 
He cannot explain how Kronstadt and the whole Red Fleet came to renounce their 
ideological support for the Government. He cannot explain the frame of mind of 
the communist elements in the Fleet during the discussions on the Trade Union 
question. He cannot explain their attitude during the 8th All-Russian Soviet 
Congress elections or during the Second Communist Conference of the Baltic 
Fleet, which took place on the eve of the insurrection. These are, however, key 
points around which the discussion should centre. When Trotsky asserts that all 
those supporting the government were genuinely proletarian and progressive, 
whereas all others represented the peasant counterrevolution, we have a right to 
ask of him that he present us with a serious factual analysis in support of his 
contention. The unfurling of subsequent events showed that the Revolution was 
being shunted onto a disastrously wrong track. This was first to compromise then 
to destroy all its social, political, and moral conquests. Did the Kronstadt 
revolt really represent an attempt to guide the Revolution along new lines? That 
is the crucial question one has to ask. Other problems should be seen as of 
secondary importance and flowing from this serious concern.</p>

<p class="fst">It is certainly not the smashing of the Kronstadt revolt that put 
a brake to the course of the Revolution. On the contrary, in our opinion, it was 
the political methods used against Kronstadt and widely practised throughout 
Russia which contributed to the setting up, on the ruins of the Social 
Revolution, of an oligarchic regime which had nothing in common with the 
original ideas of the Revolution.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a></p>

<h4><a name="h29">The Bolshevik interpretations</a></h4>

<p class="fst">In 1921 the Bolshevik Government claimed that Kronstadt had 
rebelled according to a preconceived plan. This particular interpretation was 
based on a note published in certain French newspapers (Le Matin, L'Echo de 
Paris) on February 15th. This note announced the uprising and led to the claim 
that the uprising was led by the Entente.</p>

<p class="fst">This was the argument which enabled Lenin to claim, at the 10th 
Party Congress:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The transfer of political power from the hands of the Bolsheviks 
to a vague conglomeration or alliance of heterogeneous elements who seem to be 
only a little to the Right of the Bolsheviks, and perhaps even to the 'Left' of 
the Bolsheviks&#8212;so indefinite is the sum of political groupings which tried to 
seize power in Kronstadt. Undoubtedly, at the same time, White generals&#8212;you all 
know it&#8212;played a great part in this. This is fully proved. The Paris newspapers 
reported a mutiny in Kronstadt two weeks before the events in Kronstadt took 
place."<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The publication of false news about Russia was nothing 
exceptional. Such news was published before, during, and after the Kronstadt 
events. It is undeniable that the bourgeoisie throughout the world was hostile 
to the Russian Revolution and would exaggerate any bad news emanating from that 
country. The Second Communist Conference of the Baltic Fleet had just voted a 
resounding resolution, critical of the political leadership of the Fleet. This 
fact could easily have been exaggerated by the bourgeois press, once again 
confusing the wishes with reality. To base an accusation on a 'proof' of this 
kind is inadmissible and immoral.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1938 Trotsky himself was to drop this accusation. But in the 
article we have already mentioned he refers his readers to a study of the 
Kronstadt rebellion undertaken by an American trotskyst John G Wright. In an 
article published in the New International (in February 1938) Mr Wright takes up 
once again the claim that the revolt must have been planned before-hand. In view 
of the fact the press had announced it on February 15th. He says: "the 
connection between Kronstadt and the counterrevolution can be established not 
only out of the mouths of the enemies of Bolshevism but also on the basis of 
irrefutable facts". What irrefutable facts? Again, quotations from the bourgeois 
press (Le Matin, Vossische Zeitung, The Times) giving false news before and 
during the insurrection.</p>

<p class="fst">It is interesting that these arguments were not much used at the 
time, durinq the battle itself, but only years later. If, at the time the 
Bolshevik Government had proofs of these alleged contacts between Kronstadt and 
the counter-revolutionaries why did it not try the rebels publicly? Why did it 
not show the working masses of Russia the 'real' reasons for the uprising? If 
this wasn't done it was because no such proofs existed.</p>

<p class="fst">We are also told that if the New Economic policy had been 
introduced in time the insurrection would have been avoided. But as we have just 
shown the uprising did not take place according to a preconceived plan. No one 
knew that it was necessarily going to take place. We have no theory as to the 
exact timing and development of popular movements and it is quite possible that 
under economic and political conditions different from those prevailing in the 
spring of 1921 the insurrection might never have taken place. On the other hand 
the uprising might have occurred in a different form, or in a different place, 
for instance in Nijni Novgorod where an important strike movement took place, 
coinciding with the great strike wave in Petrograd. The particular conditions 
relating to the Fleet and to Kronstadt's revolutionary past certainly had an 
effect, but one can't be certain just exactly how significant this effect was. 
Much the same applies to the statement that "if the N.E.P. had been introduced a 
few months earlier there would have been no Kronstadt revolt".</p>

<p class="fst">The N.E P. was admittedly proclaimed at the same time as the 
rebels were being massacred. But it doesn't follow in any way that the N.E.P. 
corresponded to the demands put forward by the sailors. In the Kronstadt 
Isvestia of March 14th we find a characteristic passage on this subject. The 
rebels proclaimed that "Kronstadt is not asking for freedom of trade but for 
genuine power to the Soviets". The Petrograd strikers were also demanding the 
reopening of the markets and the abolition of the road blocks set up by the 
militia. But they too were stating that freedom of trade by itself would not 
solve their problems.</p>

<p class="fst">Insofar as the N.E.P. replaced the forced requisition of 
foodstuffs by the tax in kind and insofar as it re-established internal trade it 
certainly satisfied some of the demands of the men of Kronstadt and of the 
striking Petrograd workers. With the N.E.P. rationing and arbitrary seizures 
ceased. Petty owners were able to sell their goods on the open markets, 
lessening the effects on the great famine. The N.E.P. appeared to be first and 
foremost a safety measure.</p>

<p class="fst">But the N.E.P. unleashed the capitalist elements in the country 
just at a time when the one party dictatorship was leaving the proletariat and 
working peasants without means of defence against these capitalist forces. "The 
class exerting the dictatorship is in fact deprived of the most elementary 
political rights" proclaimed the Worker's Truth, an oppositional communist group 
in 1922. The Worker's Group, another oppositlonal tendency, characterised the 
situation as follows: "The working class is totally deprived of rights, the 
trade unions being a blind instrument in the hands of the functionaries".</p>

<p class="fst">This was certainly not what the Kronstadt rebels were asking for! 
On the contrary. They were proposing measures which would have restored to the 
working class and working peasantry their true place in the new regime. The 
Bolsheviks only implemented the least important demands of the Kronstadt 
programme (those coming in eleventh place in the resolution of the rebels!). 
They totally ignored the basic demand, the demand for workers' democracy!</p>

<p class="fst">This demand, put forward in the Petropavlovsky resolution was 
neither utopian nor dangerous. We here take issue with Victor Serge. In 
Revolution Proletarienne (of September 10th, 1937) Serge stated that "while the 
sailors were engaged in mortal combat, they put forward a demand which, at that 
particular moment, was extremely dangerous&#8212;although quite genuine and sincerely 
revolutionary: the demand for freely elected soviets... they wished to unleash a 
cleansing tornado but in practice they could only have opened the doors to the 
peasant counterrevolution, of which the Whites and foreign intervention would 
have taken advantage... Insurgent Kronstadt was not counterrevolutionary, but 
its victory would inevitably have led to the counterrevolution." Contrary to 
Serge's assertion we believe that the political demands of the sailors were full 
of a deep political wisdom. They were not derived from any abstract theory but 
from a profound awareness of the conditions of Russian life. They were in no way 
counterrevolutionary.</p>

<h4><a name="h30">Rosa Luxembourg's view's</a></h4>

<p class="fst">It is worth recalling what Rosa Luxemburg, a political 
personality respected throughout the world as a great socialist militant, had 
written about the lack of democracy in the leadership of the Russian Revolution, 
as early as 1918.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"It is an incontestable fact", she wrote, "that the rule of the 
broad, popular masses is inconceivable without unlimited freedom of the press, 
without absolute freedom of meeting and of association... the gigantic tasks 
which the Bolsheviks have tackled with courage and resolution require the most 
intensive political education of the masses and accumulation of experience which 
is impossible without political freedom. Freedom restricted to those who support 
the Government or to Party members only, however numerous they may be, is not 
real freedom. Freedom is always freedom for the one who thinks differently. This 
is not because of fanaticism for abstract justice but because everything that is 
instructive, healthy and cleansing in political liberty hinges on this and 
because political liberty loses its value when freedom becomes a privilege."</p>

<p class="quoteb">"We have never worshipped at the altar of formal democracy," she 
continued. "We have always distinguished between the social content end the 
political form of bourgeois democracy. The historical task facing the 
proletariat after its accession to power is to replace bourgeois democracy by 
proletarian democracy, not to abolish all democracy... The dictatorship (of the 
proletariat) consists in the way democracy is applied, not in its abolition. It 
must be the action of the class and not of a small minority, managing things in 
the name of the class.... If political life throughout the country is stifled it 
must fatally follow that life in the soviets themselves will be paralysed. 
Without general elections, without unlimited freedom of the press and of 
assembly, without free confrontation of opinions, life will dry up in all public 
institutions&#8212;or it will be only a sham life, where the bureaucracy is the only 
active element."</p>

<p class="fst">We have dwelt on these quotations to show that Rosa Luxembourg, 
in her statements about the need for democracy, went much further than the 
Kronstadt rebels. They restricted their comments about democracy to matters of 
interest to the proletariat and to the working peasantry. Moreover Rosa 
Luxemburg formulated her criticisms of the Russian Revolution in 1918, in a 
period of full civil war, whereas the Petropavlovsk resolution was voted at a 
time when the armed struggle had virtually come to an end.</p>

<p class="fst">Would anyone dare accuse Rosa, on the basis of her criticisms, of 
having been in collusion with the international bourgeoisie? Why then are the 
demands of the Kronstadt sailors denounced as 'dangerous' and as inevitably 
leading to the counterrevolution? Has not the subsequent evolution of events 
amply vindicated both the Kronstadt rebels and Rosa Luxemburg? Was Rosa 
Luxemburg not right when she asserted that the task of the working class was to 
exercise working class power and not the dictatorship of a party or of a clique? 
For Rosa Luxemburg working class power was defined as "the achievement in a 
contest of the widest discussion, of the most active and unlimited participation 
of the popular masses in an unrestricted democracy."</p>

<h4><a name="h31">A third Soviet Revolution</a></h4>

<p class="fst">When putting forward their democratic demands, the Kronstadt 
rebels had probably never heard of the writings of Rosa Luxemburg. What they had 
heard of, however, was the first Constitution of the Soviet Republic, voted on 
July 10, 1918, by the 5th All Russian Congress of Soviets. Article 13, 14, 15 
and 16 of the Constitution assured all workers of certain democratic rights 
(freedom of worship, freedom of assembly, freedom of union, freedom of the 
press). These articles sought to prevent the allocation of special privileges to 
any specific group or Party (articles 22 and 23).</p>

<p class="fst">The same Constitution proclaimed that no worker could be deprived 
of the right to vote or of the right to stand as a candidate, provided he 
satisfied the conditions stipulated in articles 64 and 65, that is to say 
provided he did not exploit the labour of others or live off income other than 
that which he had earned.</p>

<p class="fst">The central demand of the Kronstadt insurrection&#8212;all power to the 
Soviets and not to the Party)&#8212;was in fact based on an article of the 
Constitution. This proclaimed that all central and local power would henceforth 
be precisely in the hands of the soviets!</p>

<p class="fst">From the very beginning this Constitution was violated by the 
Bolsheviks&#8212;or rather its provisions were never put into effect. It is worth 
recalling that Rosa Luxemburg's criticisms were formulated a few months after 
the vote of this new constitution charter. When in 1921 the sailors were to 
insist on a genuine application of the rights they had acquired in 1918 they 
were called 'counterrevolutionaries' and denounced as 'agents of the 
international bourgeoisie'. Sixteen years later Victor Serge was to say that the 
demands of the rebels would necessarily have led to the counterrevolution. This 
shows how deep-going were Bolshevik attitudes concerning the dangers of 
democracy.</p>

<p class="fst">The basic laws of the Soviet Republic constitute a juridical 
summary of the ideology of the October Revolution. By the end of the Civil War 
these ideas had been pushed so far back that a third revolution would have been 
necessary to reinstate them and have them applied in everyday life. This is what 
the Kronstadt rebels meant when they spoke of the Third Revolution. In the 
Kronstadt Isvestia of March 8 they wrote: "At Kronstadt the foundation stone has 
been laid of the Third Revolution. This wall break the final chains which still 
bind the working masses and wall open up new paths of socialist creation".</p>

<p class="fst">We do not know if it would have been possible to save the 
conquests of October by democratic methods. We do not know if the economic 
situation of the country and its markedly peasant character were really suitable 
for the first attempt at building socialism. These problems should be discussed. 
But the task of those seeking truth is to proclaim the facts without 
embellishments. It is not good enough to take a superciliously scientific air to 
explain away historical phenomena.</p>

<p class="fst">When Trotsky sought to explain the development of the bureaucracy 
which had strangled all real life in the institutions of the Soviet State he 
found no difficulty in outlining his conception. In The Revolution Betrayed he 
states that one of the important causes was the fact that demobilised Red Army 
officers had come to occupy leading positions in the local soviets and had 
introduced military methods into them&#8212;at a time when the proletariat was 
exhausted following the prolonged revolutionary upheaval. This apperarently led 
to the birth of the bureaucracy. Trotsky omits to recall how he himself sought 
to introduce precisely these methods into the trade unions. Was it to save the 
proletariat further fatigue? And if the proletariat was that exhausted how come 
it was still capable of waging virtually total general strikes in the largest 
and most heavily industrialised cities? And if the Party was still really the 
driving force of the social revolution how come it did not help the proletariat 
in the struggle against the nascent, but already powerful, bureaucracy&#8212;instead 
of shooting the workers down, at a time when their energy had been sapped by 
three years of imperialist war followed by three years of civil war.</p>

<p class="fst">Why did the Communist Party identify itself with the 
authoritarian state? The answer is that the Party was no longer revolutionary. 
It was no longer proletarian. And this is precisely what the men of Kronstadt 
were blaming the Party for. Their merit is to have said all this in 1921&#8212;when it 
might still have been possible to change the situation&#8212;and not to have waited 15 
years, by which time the defeat had become irrevocable.</p>

<p class="fst">Bureaucracy is almost an hereditary hallmark in Russia. It is as 
old as the Russian state itself. The Bolsheviks in power not only inherited the 
Tsarist bureaucracy itself, but its very spirit. Its very atmosphere. They 
should have realised that as the state enlarged its functions to encompass 
economic affairs, as it became the owner of all natural wealth and of industry, 
an immediate danger would arise of the rebirth and rapid development of the 
bureaucratic frame of mind.</p>

<p class="fst">A doctor treating a patient with a bad heredity takes this into 
account and advises certain precautions. What precautions did the Bolsheviks 
take to combat the bureaucratic tendencies which were obvious, in the very first 
years of the Revolution? What methods could they have used other than to allow a 
powerful democratic draught to blow through the whole atmosphere, and to 
encourage a rigorous and effective control to be exerted by the working masses?</p>

<p class="fst">True enough, some form of control was envisaged. The trouble was 
that the Commissariat of the Workers and Peasants inspection was to entrust this 
control to the very same type of bureaucrat whose power it was seeking to 
thwart. One need not seek far to find the causes of the bureaucratisation. Its 
roots lay deeply in the Bolshevik concept of the State commanded and controlled 
by a single Party, itself organised along absolutist and bureaucratic lines. 
These causes were of course aggravated by Russia's own bureaucratic traditions.</p>

<p class="fst">It is wrong to blame the peasantry for the defeat of the 
Revolution and for its degeneration into a bureaucratic regime. It would be too 
easy to explain all Russia's difficulties by the agrarian character of her 
economy. Some people seem to say at one and the same time that the Kronstadt 
revolt against the bureaucracy was a peasant revolt and that the bureaucracy 
itself was of peasant origin. With such a concept of the role of the peasantry 
one may ask how the Bolsheviks dared advocate the idea of the socialist 
revolution? How did they dare struggle for it in an agrarian country?</p>

<p class="fst">Some claim that the Bolsheviks allowed themselves such actions 
(as the suppression of Kronstadt) in the hope of a forthcoming world revolution, 
of which they considered themselves the vanguard. But would not a revolution in 
another country have been influenced by the spirit of the Russian Revolution? 
When one considers the enormous moral authority of the Russian Revolution 
throughout the world one may ask oneself whether the deviations of this 
Revolution would not eventually have left an imprint on other countries. Many 
historical facts allow such a judgement. One may recognise the impossibility of 
genuine socialist construction in a single country, yet have doubts as to 
whether the bureaucratic deformations of the Bolshevik regime would have been 
straightened out by the winds coming from revolutions in other countries.</p>

<p class="fst">The fascist experience in countries like Germany shows that an 
advanced stage of capitalist development is an insufficient guarantee against 
the growth of absolutist and autocratic tendencies. Although this is not the 
place to explain the phenomenon, we must note the powerful wave of 
authoritarianism coming from economically advanced countries and threatening to 
engulf old ideas and traditions. It is incontestable that Bolshevism is morally 
related to this absolutist frame of mind. It had in fact set a precedent for 
subsequent tendencies. No one can be sure that had another revolution occurred 
elsewhere following the one in Russia, Bolshevism would have democratised 
itself. It might again have revealed its absolutist features.</p>

<p class="fst">Were there not real dangers in the democratic way? Was there no 
reason to fear reformist influences in the soviets, if democracy had been given 
free rein? We accept that this was a real danger. But it was no more of a danger 
than what inevitably followed the uncontrolled dictatorship of a single party, 
whose General Secretary was already Stalin.<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">We are told that the country was at the end of its tether, that 
it had lost its ability to resist. True, the country was weary of war. But on 
the other hand it was full of constructive forces, ardently seeking to learn and 
to educate themselves. The end of the Civil War saw a surge of workers and 
peasants towards schools, workers' universities and institutes of technical 
education. Wasn't this yearning the best testimony to the vitality and 
resistance of these classes? In a country with a very high level of illiteracy, 
such an education could greatly have helped the working masses in the genuine 
exercise of real power.</p>

<p class="fst">But by its very essence a dictatorship destroys the creative 
capacities of a people. Despite the undoubted attempts of the Government to 
educate workers, education soon became the privilege of Party members loyal to 
the leading faction. From 1921 on, workers' faculties and higher educational 
establishments were purged of their more independent minded elements. This 
process gained tempo with the development of oppositional tendencies within the 
Party. The attempt at a genuine mass education was increasingly compromised. 
Lenin's wish that every cook should be able to govern the state became less and 
less likely to be implemented.</p>

<p class="fst">The revolutionary conquest could only be deepened through a 
genuine participation of the masses. Any attempt to substitute an 'elite' for 
those masses could only be profoundly reactionary.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1921 the Russian Revolution stood at the cross roads. The 
democratic or the dictatorial way, that was the question. By lumping together 
bourgeois and proletarian democracy the Bolsheviks were in fact condemning both. 
They sought to build socialism from above, throughskill ful manoeuvres of the 
Revolutionary General Staff. While waiting for a world revolution that was not 
round the corner, they built a state capitalist society, where the working class 
no longer had the right to make the decisions most intimately concerning it.</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin was not alone in perceiving that the Kronstadt rebellion 
was a challenge to this plan. Both he and the Bolsheviks were fully aware that 
what was at stake was the monopoly of their Party. Kronstadt might have opened 
the way to a genuine proletarian democracy, incompatible with the Party's 
monopoly of power. That is why Lenin preferred to destroy Kronstadt. He chose an 
ignoble but sure way: the calumny that Kronstadt was allied to the bourgeoisie 
and to the agrarian counterrevolution.</p>

<p class="fst">When Kouzmin, Commissar to the Baltic Fleet, had stated at the 
Kronstadt meeting of March 2nd that the Bolsheviks would not surrender power 
without a fight, he was saying the truth. Lenin must have laughed at this 
Commissar who obviously didn't understand the ABC of Bolshevik morality or 
tactics. Politically and morally one had to destroy the opponent&#8212;not argue with 
him using real arguments. And destroy its revolutionary opponents is exactly 
what the Bolshevik government did.</p>

<p class="fst">The Kronstadt rebels were a grey, amorphous mass. But such masses 
occasionally show an incredible level of political awareness. If there had been 
among them a number of men of 'higher' political understanding the insurrection 
might well never have taken place, for those men would have understood firstly 
that the demands of the rebels were in flagrant conflict with the policies of 
the Kremlin&#8212;and secondly that, at that particular moment in time, the government 
felt itself firmly enough in the saddle to shoot down, without pity or mercy, 
any tendency daring seriously to oppose its views or plans.</p>

<p class="fst">The men of Kronstadt were sincere but naive. Believing in the 
justness of their cause they did not foresee the tactics of their opponents. 
They waited for help from the rest of the country, whose demands they knew they 
were voicing. They lost sight of the fact that the rest of the country was 
already in the iron grip of a dictatorship which no longer allowed the people 
the free expression of its wishes and the free choice of its institutions.</p>

<p class="fst">The great ideological and political discussion between 'realists' 
and 'dreamers' between 'scientific socialists' and the 'revolutionary 
volnitza'<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> was fought out, weapons in hand. It ended, in 1921, with the 
political and military defeat of the 'dreamers'. But Stalin was to prove to the 
whole world that this defeat was also the defeat of socialism, over a sixth of 
the earth's surface.</p>

was also endorsed by the whole working population of Kronstadt in General 
Assembly. It became the political programme of the insurrection. It therefore 
deserves a careful analysis.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n3" href="#fn3">[3]</a> The accusation was made in answer to a question put to Trotsky 
by Wedelin Thomas, a member of the New York Commission of Enquiry into the 
Moscow Trials.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n4" href="#fn4">[4]</a> Whom has history vindicated in this matter? Shortly before his 
second stroke, Lenin was to write (<i>Pravda</i>, 28th January, 1923): "Let us 
speak frankly. The Inspection now enjoys no authority whatsoever. Everybody 
knows that there is no worse institution than our Inspection". This was said a 
bare eighteen months after the suppression of Kronstadt. (It is worth pointing 
out that Stalin had been the chief of the Rabkrin from 1919 till the spring of 
1922, when he became General Secretary of the Party. He continued to exercise a 
strong influence over Rabkrin even after he had formally left it. Lenin, 
incidentally, had voiced no objection to Stalin's appointment or activities in 
this post. That only came later. Lenin had in fact defended both Stalin and 
Rabkrin against some of Trotsky's more far-sighted criticisms&#8212;see. I. Deutscher,

<p class="endnote"><a name="n26" href="#fn26">[26]</a> In his last book, written in the tragic context of an unequal 
struggle with his mortal enemy, Trotsky made what was for him a great effort at 
being objective. This is what he says about Kronstadt: "The Stalinist school of 
falsification is not the only one that flourishes today in the field of Russian 
history. Indeed, it derives a measure of sustenance from certain legends built 
on ignorance and sentimentalism, such as the lurid tales concerning Kronstadt, 
Makhno and other episodes of the Revolution. Suffice it to say that what the 
Soviet Government did reluctantly at Kronstadt was a tragic necessity; naturally 
the revolutionary government could not have 'presented' the fortress that 
protected Petrograd to the insurgent sailors only because a few dubious 
Anarchists and S.R:s were sponsoring a handful of reactionary peasants and 
soldiers in rebellion. Similar considerations were involved in the case of 
Makhno and other potentially revolutionary elements that were perhaps 
well-meaning but definitely ill-acting." Stalin by Trotsky. Hollis and Carter

Lenin and Trotsky)&#8212;only took place in 1922. (Ed. Solidarity).</p>
