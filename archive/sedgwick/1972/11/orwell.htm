<p class="fst"><strong>The Unknown Orwell</strong>, by Peter Stansky and William Abrahams (Constable, three quid), is a disappointment. Orwell&#8217;s widow has made their work impossible by denying them the right to quote from his published work or the Orwell Archives.</p>

<p>We get a lot of paraphrasing of Orwell&#8217;s autobiographical bits, and some extra interviews with people who remember Orwell in different phases up to 1933.</p>

<p>Some of the new witnesses of Eric Blair (Orwell&#8217;s real name, dropped for purposes of book-authorship) are good: Note especially that Orwell&#8217;s fine essay, <em>A Hanging</em>, written as though it were a personal report, is actually fiction, since Orwell confided in a friend that he had never attended an execution.</p>

<p>The authors tend to make over-sweeping judgments which are then partly withdrawn: for example, that Blair&#8217;s prime intention in becoming a down-and-out in London and Paris was literary (to gather writing material) rather than political (to purge his guilt after serving imperialism in Burma; or that his marriage in 1936 was &#8216;the first time in his life he entered a deep and passionate bond&#8217; &#8211; when for a start there are two meaningful emotional involvements with prostitutes on record.</p>

<p>And they do go on about the trappings of Eton and the parish register of Blairs, rather in the vein of heavy-footed tourists in Oldie England. Orwell remains more unknown than before in these lifeless pages.</p>

<hr class="section" />
<p class="fst">On to Imperial College Department of Mechanical Engineering, where a Conference of Radical Scholars of Soviet and East European Studies fills a biggish lecture theatre.</p>

<p>The title may evoke images of beardies in mortarboards and academic robes sporting the <strong>New Statesman</strong> as they discuss who&#8217;s &#8216;in&#8217; this year at the Kremlin. But it is a young, unestablished audience: to judge from the attendance, the Russian Question is rearing its ugly head again, as another politicised horde looks for some theory to get under its belt after a diet of demonstrations.</p>

<p>Other signs that the Russian Question mark is at it once more: the lousy (no misprint) movie about Trotsky&#8217;s murder; the new-found interest in oppositional currents surfacing in Russia; and somebody in the interval tells me that a playwright friend is writing a drama all about the Kronstadt rising of 1921. I can only add my hopes that it will be written for performance on ice.</p>
