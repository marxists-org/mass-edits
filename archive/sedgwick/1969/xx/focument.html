<p class="quoteb"><em><strong>The following document was handed around during the
course of a National Conference of the International Socialists in
1969. Although naturally it bore no name, there was no doubt that the
author was Peter Sedgwick. Following the IS unity proposals of 1968 a
small group known as Workers Fight joined the International
Socialists and claimed rights of representation on the National
Committee as a &#8220;tendency&#8221;. There were a number of complex and
tortuous discussions as to how the tendency&#8217;s representatives
should be elected, and this was a comment on the debates.</strong></em></p>

<h4>IS INTERNAL FOCUMENT<br/>
DEFINITION OF FOCUMENT: A FORGED DOCUMENT</h4>

<p class="fst">1. In the remote Bogland township of Ballycaucus the results of
the Dail election were awaited with frenzied eagerness. Well past
midnight, the Returning Officer appeared on the balcony with a piece
of paper in his hand, the two candidates following him to face the
throng. When the expectant commotion had died down, the Returning
Officer read out, in a firm authoritative voice: &#8220;Here are the
results of the Ballycaucus election. F. Nourke (General-List
Democrat): two thousand and three votes. S. O&#8217;trotsky (Faction-List
Centralist Democrat): one thousand and five votes. I therefore
declare Seamus O&#8217;trotsky duly elected.&#8221; The citizens of
Ballycaucus, whose loyalties to factionalist principles far exceeded
any mere political considerations, went delirious with joy. Francis
Nourke wept at the result, but extended his hand to his opponent, and
said: &#8220;Obviously I am disappointed at my vote &#8211; I blame the fine
weather for that. However the electorate&#8217;s verdict is clear and I
am content to abide by it. I must, however, point out that the swing
is against O&#8217;trotsky: last time he got only three votes fewer than
me. If enough of my supporters abstain next time, he may get more
voters than I do and I shall join with all the other runner-up
candidates to claim our due quota of minority representation. Next
time, in that case, Ballycaucus will be ours!&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">2. Jean-Baptiste Marat Smith, an earnest student of the world and
its revolutionary past, had made an exhaustive study of the French
Revolution: its causes, its progress, its factions, its ultimate
betrayal. He devoted many years to the study of the original
documents, the suppressed history of liquidated rebels, the disputes
among rival historians of the period: he could dismiss whole schools
of thought on the subject with a measured aside &#8211; &#8220;Girondin
rubbish!&#8221;, &#8220;Infantile Babeufism!&#8221;, and so on. He argued with
his friends late into many nights, each time coming up with an
ignored piece of evidence, a crucial item in the biography of the
leaders&#8217; treachery: &#8220;Read this,&#8221; he would exclaim, &#8220;on the
massacre of the sans-culottes at Marseilles in 1793! There&#8217;s your
Jacobinism for you!&#8221; Crisp, merciless ripostes came from the
opposing circles of students who denied Smith&#8217;s theses on the
Revolution: <em>Once more on the Marseilles Massacre</em>, <em>Hue and
Cry over Sans-culottes!</em> followed in rapid succession from their
pens. &#8220;Smith is basically a voluntaristic sans-culotte populist&#8221;,
the rumour went round.</p>

<p>Smith went deeper and deeper into the history of the period, and
decided that a firm stand must be made. The traitor Robespierre must
be definitely exposed before the new generation of cadres, who were
still under the influence of the Jacobin traditions that had been so
assiduously fostered by the dominant camp. At the next conference of
the International Revolutionary Alliance (to which all contending
schools of thought belonged, as a matter of course), he stood at the
microphone and denounced Robespierre and all his works, to the jeers
and boos of the assembled Jacobins. He continued: &#8220;We, the
Libertarian Proletarian Faction, claim proportional rights. The
organisational and political heritage of the Jacobins must be
challenged! Remember Marseilles!&#8221; The speaker that followed him
poured scorn on Smith&#8217;s contribution: &#8220;The degeneracy of the
French Revolution has nothing to do with Robespierre, as the most
elementary Marxist analysis will show! It was entirely due to the
weakness &#8211; to the point of actual non-existence &#8211; of the French
proletariat after the wars against the Holy Alliance, and the failure
of the revolutionary upsurge to spread beyond France. Smith lacks the
most elementary conceptions of the dialectic. The Jacobin conception
of organisation must enter the consciousness of all our members:
without it, victory is impossible. The Robespierrist Faction stands
before you for election!&#8221; The applause was tumultuous.</p>

<p>The situation became more complicated when the entire Libertarian
Proletarian Faction read another book of French revolutionary history
and decided that something was to be said for Robespierre after all.
Three of them could not stand the strain any longer, and went
straight out of politics. The others joined the Robespierrist
faction, as even more ardent Jacobins than the rest. At the nest
elections of the International Revolutionary Alliance they stood as
Jacobins, having desired election as anti-Jacobins only six months
earlier. They were elected to the leadership, displacing several
candidates who over many years had been engaged in consistent
revolutionary activity in the twentieth century, rather than in the
eighteenth, and whose absence from leading committees henceforth
seriously handicapped the group.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Robespierre looked up into the world from his place in
an outer circle of purgatory, and smiled at the goings-on among his
heirs and descendants. &#8220;These British have no revolutionary
tradition whatsoever,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;They are completely clueless
about the business. After all, whatever else I did, right or wrong, I
did refrain from one cardinal error: I never quoted Robespierre.&#8221;<br/>

<h4>3. O B I T U A R Y</h4>

<p class="fst">It is with a heaving heart, and a profound sense of grief, that we
announce the death of Nikolai Davidovich Krapotkin, the leading
theoretician of International Factionalism.</p>

<p>Nikolai Davidovich was converted to Marxism at the age of seven,
when he led the first infant sit-in against the pedagogic
gerontocracy of the Junior Kids at Aberystwyth County Primary School.
Even at this tender age his teachers noted the stamp of leadership in
the lad, as he drew around him noisy bands of infants in active
combat against other small factions, who at this stage were
distinguished only by the differently-coloured ribbons that had been
thoughtfully provided for them by their elders. &#8220;The Blues, the
Blues, <em>they never lose</em>!&#8221; Nikolai would yell as he led his
small troop, and &#8220;The Reds, the Reds, <em>they wet their beds</em>!&#8221;
These qualities of aggressive combination, personal dominance and
sharp differentiation from rivals were to remain with Nikolai for
life, ensuring him a leading place in the deliberations of any
assembly that he chose to enter.</p>

<p>His rise to political fame was meteoric. Educated with distinction
at Ruskin College and Yale, Nikolai Davidovich threw in a promising
career as Professor of Structural-Functionalist Algebra at Harvard,
to become a full-time worker in the great revolutionary-factionalist
movement that in the late nineteen-sixties swept the world, from
Britain as far as China (and vice versa). It was Krapotkin who
brought to fruition the stupendous Struggle Against Localism that
culminated in the campaign of 1973, when he personally led urban
guerrilla teams in nightly assaults against what he correctly saw to
be the objective social basis of Localism: the localities. He had
even got through dismantling some half of the Liverpool docks, and
most of Spitalfields Market (carefully replacing each brick with a
volume of the <strong>Works of V.I. Lenin</strong>), when it was fraternally
pointed out to him that his attitude implied a one-sided exaggeration
of the correct dialectical position, confusing the respective roles
of the Party and the Class (i.e., it was tantamount to &#8211;
Substitutionism!) The working class, owing to the Uneven Development
of Life Itself, could not be expected to give up its localities: thus
it could and should retain its boozers on the corner, its
dominoes-teams, its regional accents and vulgarities, and even its
Fragmentary Struggles (though there was some doubt as to how useful
these last really were). It was only The Party, as a superior form of
organisation to the working class, which had to be transformed
thoroughly from Localism into Factionalism. Nikolai corrected his
error energetically: within six months, all the local,
particularistic features that had so blighted The Party (as he and
his friends liked to call themselves) were eradicated. Instead of the
old names of branches, Grays and Tilbury, Glasgow, Tower Hamlets, and
Merseyside, there sprang up new forms of organisation, based not on
the unprincipled accident of <em>place</em>, but on <em>ideas</em>: the
Neo-Leninist Fraction, the Guevarist-Libertarians, the True
Trotskyites, etc. The process of transformation was still not quite
complete: years later the Workers International Tendency (formerly
the Bootle Branch) had still not got rid of their scouser twang while
making factional speeches, and the Bakuninist-Communist Trend (lately
the East London Branch) had to be restrained by threats of expulsion
from making for the nearest eel-stall when they went out leafleting.</p>
<p>However, by 1977 the new structure was sufficiently advanced to
enable the next stage of Party-building to take place: the election
of a factionally-based leadership. This at first presented unexpected
difficulties. Scholars of late 20th-Century Socialism have fully
recorded the Great Factional Binge (alias Cultural Revolution) of
1966&#8211;9: less well-known is Krapotkin&#8217;s personal contribution in the
later years of mature growth in the factional world. The crisis in
Nikolai Davidovich&#8217;s own organisation came during a long, hot
summer of debate when the phase of Laissez-Faire Factionalism was at
its peak of expansion. Proportional representation of minorities had
reached such a pitch that there were no longer any majorities in the
group left to be proportionally represented against. The final crunch
came when the group&#8217;s Homosexual Tendency, then engaged in an
unprincipled (and, as it turned out, short-lived) fusion with the
Bloc of Bolshevik-Lesbianism, demanded their due of representation on
the Central Committee in the proportion of 1 in 4 of delegates, on
the grounds that all social surveys from the Kinsey Report onwards
had revealed that this was their incidence in any sample of the
population.</p>

<p>This demand would have split the organisation irrevocably, had not
Nikolai proposed the essential theoretical distinction which was to
govern all factional methodology in the next three decades.
Krapotkin&#8217;s First Law of Groupuscular Dynamics states, in terms
that were at once accepted by all owing to their sheer, blinding
simplicity: in deciding whether a faction is really a faction, one
must distinguish between a faction and a bloc. A faction is a genuine
object, distinguished by a clear line as manifested in its internal
documents, use of jargon, etc. A bloc, on the other hand, is nothing
of the kind: it is a pseudo-object, an unprincipled conglomeration or
swamp of confused elements, with nothing in common except spleen,
careerism, Menshevism, substitutionism or capitulationism. The
distinction having been agreed, it still took some time for it to be
got working in practical terms: for all subsequent Conferences of the
organisation were rent by battles in which each minority claimed to
be an authentic Faction, and was denounced as a mere Bloc by its
competitors.</p>

<p>Once again, the organisational brilliance of Nikolai Davidovich
came to the rescue. Since it was clearly improper for the majority to
adjudicate on the status of the minority, and no minority could
accept the claims of any other, the task of faction-classification
could no longer be left to the pitfalls of human error. Only a
specially programmed computer could be entrusted with the delicate
task of determining the eligibility of a given minority; indeed, only
such an automaton would now have the time and the I.Q. to read and
assimilate the huge piles of bumph (&#8220;documents&#8221;) that dropped on
the doormats of branch secretaries with the frequency and volume of
tranquilliser advertisements beamed at family G.P.s. On Nikolai&#8217;s
motion, it was resolved to set up a &#163;70,000 Fighting Fund for the
purchase of a suitable computer. The target was reached inside five
weeks, and the FACTION ANALYSIS, RETRIEVAL AND STORAGE SYSTEM (FARSS
for short) which was personally programmed by Krapotkin&#8217;s genius,
came into operation, manned by six full-time workers at Centre.</p>

<p>The basic principle upon which FARSS operated was simple and
uncontroversial. A vast store of information drawn from the archives
of Marxism and related trends was processed and fed into the
computer&#8217;s memory-bank: thus, FARSS was initially equipped with
documentation on the innumerable factional splits of the First,
Second, Third and Fourth Internationals from the Bakuninite Alliance
down to the Cliff breakaway of 1951. This monumental tank of
factional history, reeking with such an accumulation of corrosive
bitterness that the metal elements of the computer had to be changed
every week before they disappeared, formed the criterion against
which all incoming claimants for factional identity had to be tested.
Each new internal document was tested for length, unreadability,
aridity and monomania against the rich legacy of the factional past:
and the decision of FARSS, reached in a matter of milliseconds, was
final and binding. In a few months, the amount of fresh and original
factional deposit that had passed the test and penetrated the core of
the computer (there to form part of the criteria for all later
claimants) greatly exceeded the entire factional ingoings of the
preceding 150 years. The work of the Party was thus greatly facilitated.</p>

<p>Nikolai Davidovich&#8217;s next stroke of organisation was also
superb. The period from 1978 to 1981 is generally chronicled by Party
historians as the Age of the Factional Suffragettes. These years were
exclusively taken up, in the councils of the Party, by disputes over
the merits of different systems of factional representation. Even
though factions as such had now been rigorously defined by FARSS, the
precise meaning of Democratic Centralism still left many a comrade
with sleepless nights: the Twenty-Vote system, the Factional
Aldermanic System, The Property-Qualification Faction System (where
property was defined in terms of reams of duplicated bumph), all were
canvassed without any consensus (that old, almost forgotten word)
being reached. Krapotkin again proposed, in a paper appearing in the
<strong>Journal of Factional Mathematics</strong> for 1982, the definitive
solution: a new computer program, written by himself, and termed
&#8220;Program for Immediate Solution of Optimum Faction Formation&#8221;
(abbreviated immediately to PISOFF). The greatest merit of PISOFF was
that nobody could understand how it worked except Krapotkin:
electoral arrangements under it were so complicated that none of the
voting strategies open to delegates under other factional systems
could ever be used. Since each delegate could be quite certain that
none of the other factions were trying to fiddle the ballot,
everybody could vote freely for the candidates he actually wanted to
see elected on to the Central Committee : something which had not
happened for many, many years.</p>

<p>Yet, in the end, it was through this very brilliance that Nikolai
Davidovich came to his downfall. One night, as the voting returns
were being printed out in the usual utterly incomprehensible form
provided by the Program (another great advantage, since nobody could
now allege that any faction was over-, under-, or even correctly
represented) Nikolai Davidovich became aware of a crucial
mathematical error in one of the Program&#8217;s equations, which
hitherto he had not noticed. This realisation caused an event to take
place which was quite uncharacteristic of the man: Nikolai did the
one thing that no factional leader should ever, under any
circumstances, do:</p>

<p class="c">HE CHANGED HIS MIND.</p>

<p class="fst">The consequences were immediate and fateful. For Nikolai
Davidovich occupied all his positions in the Party in virtue of his
delegation to them from his own faction (i.e., the original faction
or Factional Faction that went back as far as 1968&#8211;9). Since the
Faction was committed to PISOFF as one of its basic list of
transitional demands, Krapotkin would now have no alternative but to
resign from it. This meant that he would also have to resign from the
Party&#8217;s Central Committee, its Central Political Bureau, its
Administrative Policy Sub-Committee, its Organisational Credentials
Committee, its Probationary Members Scrutineering Department, the
Editorial Board of <strong>Theoretical Organ</strong>, and the fraternal
delegations to the Spanish and Polish underground: for he held all
these offices, not as an individual but as a faction member. He knew
that the work of the organisation would be paralysed if he left his
duties. He could not resign; yet, in all revolutionary honour, he
could not avoid resigning. Thus did Nikolai Davidovich confront the
classic dilemma of the revolutionary factionalist of our age.</p>

<p>There was only one way out for him. Nikolai Davidovich turned to
the large iron safe in which he kept his great <em>Archive of
Factionalism</em>: the duplicated memoranda with the arguments of his
opponents, cross-indexed for future reference; the pile of his own
masterly contributions to the internal press; his most prized
possession, the collected works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Gramsci and
Trotsky, in a specially prepared edition with each page of each
volume perforated every three lines and gummed on the reverse side,
for ease of quotation. From this collection Krapotkin extracted the
entire record of his factional thinking, and laid it on a table,
along with a knife, a fork and a plate.</p>

<p>His duty was plain, and he undertook it unflinchingly.</p>

<p>He ate his words.</p>

<p>The effect was instantaneous.</p>

<p>Nikolai Davidovich, our beloved theoretician, is no more.</p>
