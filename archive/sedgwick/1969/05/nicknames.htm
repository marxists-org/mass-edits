<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, 8 May 1969. (letter)<br />
Transcribed by Ted Crawford.<br />
Marked up by <a href="../../../../admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Marxists&#8217; Internet Archive</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">In the May Day issue, Martin Shaw, reporting from LSE, writes of &#8216;marxist&#8217; (Martin Shaw&#8217;s quotes) &#8216;Ralph Miliband (known to the students as Moribund).&#8217;</p>

<p>May we inform you that a number of socialist students have also been given curious nicknames by their counterparts on the teaching staff? However in the midst of a common struggle, we would regard it as sectarian to follow comrade Shaw&#8217;s example by providing details: in most cases, anyway, it would be libellous.</p>

<p>It is interesting that your writer feels it necessary to question Ralph Miliband&#8217;s standing as a marxist. We can only say that, on the evidence of past statistics, if 1 per of today&#8217;s militant students make as serious a contribution to marxist exposition and analysis as Ralph Miliband has, we shall be very lucky indeed.</p>

<p>If as many as 3 per cent stick to socialism after they graduate for as long as he has done, then we shall know the revolution is on its way.</p>
