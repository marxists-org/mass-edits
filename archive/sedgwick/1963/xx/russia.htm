<p class="fst"><strong>War and the Soviet Union</strong>, Revised Edition, H.S. Dinerstein, Praeger, Paperbacks 14s6d.</p>

<p class="fst">Dinerstein&#8217;s study of the evolution of Soviet nuclear strategy first appeared in 1959 and provided useful source material on the &#8216;workers&#8217; bomb&#8217; (see Raymond Challinor&#8217;s article <em>Zig-Zag</em> in <strong>IS3</strong>). The present edition makes no attempt to up-date the text to take in more recent developments. There is however a fairly useful but cursory introduction of less than a dozen pages, commenting upon such topics as the Soviet lag in ICBMs in 1960-61 and (more importantly for ourselves) the renovation in leading Soviet circles of an earlier emphasis on the &#8216;pre-emptive strike&#8217;.</p>

<p>Previous Soviet discussion of pre-emption had, as Dinerstein establishes in the main text, erupted painfully over 1955-6 with the shedding of Stalinist military dogmatics (which were essentially pre-nuclear). The author&#8217;s skillful dissection, clean through the pulp of successive Red Army magazine-numbers, displays a process of gradual calcification, from the tender tooth-buds of the first nuclears into the horrendous fangs of amateur H-bomb strategy. Dinerstein&#8217;s approach to his subject-matter may be described as technological or simply amoral. That is, he does not stop to denounce the Soviet &#8216;first-strike&#8217; theorists, but exhibits their ideas as a fact of the modern world. And yet the strategy of the pre-emptive strike (like its near relative or even twin, the doctrine of &#8216;preventive war&#8217;) surely makes nonsense of many of the broader political rationalisations which habitually bolster military science; if the doctrine of the first strike follows so closely upon the evolution of modern weapons, how any longer can a distinction be maintained, at least by the nuclear powers, between &#8216;aggressive&#8217; and &#8216;non-aggressive&#8217;, &#8216;just&#8217; and &#8216;unjust&#8217; wars? But then it would have been odd to find such considerations looming large in a study (quote from the preface) &#8216;prepared as part of the research undertaken for the US Air Force by the RAND Corporation&#8217;.</p>
