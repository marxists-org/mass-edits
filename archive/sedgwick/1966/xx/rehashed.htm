<p class="fst"><strong>Marxism and Psychoanalysis</strong><br />
Reuben Osborn<br />
<em>Barrie &amp; Rockcliff 21s.</em></p>

<p class="fst">This is a revised edition of the author&#8217;s <strong>Freud and Marx</strong> (Gollancz 1937). The first edition provoked in reply one of the best short books on Freud, Francis Bartlett&#8217;s <strong>Sigmund Freud</strong>. Bartlett (who has also recently published a withering Marxist attack on Pavlov) quite rightly emphasised the irreconcilability of Freud&#8217;s thought with a socialist standpoint, and pointed out the culture-determined and speculative character of much of its content.</p>

<p>The new edition of Osborn is the same mechanical amalgam of odds and ends from Freud with the Hegelian &#8216;dialectical categories&#8217;: repression is an instance of quantity-into-quality, for instance. Osborn is totally uncritical of Morgan&#8217;s and Freud&#8217;s reconstructions of ancient societies, even accepting Freud&#8217;s myth of the slaying of the primal father by the sons of the original horde. There are starry-eyed references to questionable psychological systems such as &#8216;motivational research&#8217; and Eysenck&#8217;s psychology of politics. Osborn&#8217;s exegesis of Marxism has some useful popularisation, but it seems that &#8216;Freudo-Marxism&#8217; (Osborn&#8217;s coinage) is to be welcomed because both Freud and Marx treated consciousness in terms of social causality. Unfortunately that is about all they have iii common: in any case the concept of the unconscious as a province of the psyche is an unnecessary one in the discussion of human irrationality.</p>

<p>Most curious of all, Osborn refers us to his <strong>The Psychology of Reaction</strong> (1938) in support of his view that a better acquaintance with Freud would have alerted Marxists to the dangers of Stalin&#8217;s personality. The late John Strachey, in his introduction to the present edition, looks back to his original preface to <strong>Freud and Marx</strong> (reprinted here in full) and feels glad to be reminded too that he was a premature Freudo-Marxist in the Thirties. Like Osborn, he blames the vices of Stalinism partly on the failure of Marxists to learn from Freud.</p>

<p>While one may agree that psychological naivete has been all too common on the Left, the relevant areas of psychology for socialists are not particularly Freudian. Attention to common-sense observation about the dangers of fanaticism, the dynamics of in-groups and committees, and the strategies and sources of rationalisation are a more powerful antidote to degeneracy than speculation drawn from the dreams of emotionally disturbed people. In any case, as Brian Pearce reported in a study of British Stalinism in the old <strong>Labour Review</strong>, Osborn&#8217;s <strong>The Psychology of Reaction</strong> actually &#8216;tried to identify fascism and Trotskyism psychologically (&#8220;A knowledge of the psychology of fascist leaders is at the same time a knowledge of the psychology of the Trotskyists&#8221;) and this was reviewed enthusiastically by John Strachey&#8217; who &#8216;offered as his own view that &#8220;Trotskyists&#8221; were recruited mainly from &#8220;insufficiently sensitive,&#8221; &#8220;inhuman&#8221; types.&#8217;</p>

<p>It seems that this is another case of Freudian error.</p>
