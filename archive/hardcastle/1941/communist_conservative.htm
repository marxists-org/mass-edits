<p>The Communists have a simple faith : Whatever the Russian Government does is right, whether it be Pacts with Hitler or war with Hitler. Whatever helps the Russian Government is right, whether it be denouncing the Labour Party for associating with Conservatives or voting for Conservatives.</p>

<p>Viewed thus there is no inconstancy in the recent Communist support for Conservative candidates at Lancaster and Hampstead. At Lancaster, where the National Conservative candidate was opposed by an Independent Liberal and by Mr. Fenner Brockway of the I.L.P., "a Communist deputation visited the Conservative campaign headquarters in Lancaster this afternoon and offered to work for the return of Mr. Maclean, the National Government candidate."&#8212;(<em>Daily Telegraph</em>, October 14th, 1941.)</p>

<p>At Hampstead there were four candidates, all with the same policy, vigorous prosecution of the war and aid for Russia. The Communists supported the official Conservative candidate, Flying Officer Charles Challen, who won the seat.</p>

<p>An interesting sidelight on the Lancaster election was the statement made by the I.L.P. candidate to the <em>Manchester Guardian</em> : &#8212;</p>
<p class="quoteb">Mr. Brockway himself told the writer that a number of Labour voters who did not wholly accept his views about the war had told him they would vote for him for "old acquaintance sake" and as a protest against "too much Toryism in the House of Commons."</p>
