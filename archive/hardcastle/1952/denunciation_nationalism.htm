<p>The Indian, M. N. Roy, who was at one time prominent in the Communist 
International, but later broke away and took a line of his own, recently wrote 
for the <em>Manchester Guardian</em> (21/6/52) an article "Asian Nationalism. 
Its Roots in Race Hatred."</p>

<p>In it he puts the case that the Asiatic nationalist movements are not just 
movements to secure independence from the foreign governments that kept them in 
colonial subjection, for even after achieving independence they continue to 
preach the same anti-foreign doctrines as before. He quotes Mr. Nehru, Prime 
Minister of India, and advocate of Indian nationalism, as having admitted that 
he does not know what nationalism is:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"What exactly is nationalism? I do not know, and it is 
extremely difficult to define. In the case of a country under foreign domination 
it is easy to define what nationalism is. It is anti-foreign power. But in a 
free country it is something positive. Even so, I think that a large element of 
it is negative or anti-, and so sometimes we find that nationalism, which is a 
healthy force, becomes-maybe after liberation-unhealthy, retrogressive, 
reactionary, or expansive."</p>

<p>Yet though Mr. Nehru could not define nationalism he went on to declare that 
it "warms the heart of every Asian" and that "any other force that may seek to 
function must define itself in terms of this nationalism."</p>

<p>Mr. Roy says this is nonsense and that what Mr. Nehru&#39;s explanation really 
means is that nationalism is "race hatred kept alive artificially."</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Asia nationalism is an unmixed evil. It has not got the 
saving grace of a cultural and idealist origin as in the case of earlier 
European nationalism."</p>

<p>Although Mr. Roy notices that between the wars European nationalism developed 
into fascism, and quotes the statement of the late Lord Acton that nationality 
sacrifices everything "to the imperative necessity of making the nation the 
mould and measure of the State," he does not appreciate the simple fact that 
nationalism has been and is everywhere the form in which each capitalist group 
tries to carve out a place for itself in the world of warring capitalist states. 
If he did he would not be at all surprised that the politicians who have used 
nationalism to gain independence from a colonial power need it just as much 
afterwards in order to persuade the workers to go on fighting capitalism&#39;s 
battles.</p>

<p>If it is an illusion to think that nations can be friendly in a capitalist 
world provided that they are all "independent," it is equally an illusion on the 
part of Mr. Roy to think that the Powers, great and small could dispense with 
nationalism.</p>

<p>At least one thing Mr. Roy has correctly summed up. Discussing the 
disappointing results of national independence from the worker&#39;s point of view, 
he says that when India and other countries achieved independence, "absolutely 
nothing changed except the personnel of the State machinery."</p>

<p>On one thing we can put Mr. Roy right. He says of the "reforming Liberals and 
the revolutionary Left: in the Western countries" that, disregarding the bitter 
experience and irony of history which had shown them nationalist movements 
starting with men like Mazzini and ending with regimes like Mussolini&#39;s, they 
"vied with each other in patronising colonial nationalism." Whatever the 
Liberals and Labourites did, the S.P.G.B. certainly did not fall into this error 
but always condemned nationalist propaganda whether at home or abroad, in Europe 
or in Asia.</p>
