<p class="fst">The problems of the social system in Russia have often been 
compared with those created by revolutionary France more than a century and a 
half ago. An understanding of both, it is said, requires perspective. Historians 
are reminded that the years have dissolved the acrimony heaped on the events of 
the Great French Revolution &#8212; that more 'good' than 'harm' was done. Much the 
same is implied for Russia. Supporters, even mild critics, of the Stalin regime 
tell us that so 'new' a phenomenon requires the test of many generations, that 
the judgement nourished by immediate events, by 'passing' abuses, must be 
suspended until lasting outlines appear. In place of the years and of abuses 
engendered by 'expediency', a vast theoretical corpus has been brought to the 
support of the Russian social system. We are invited to equate the 
nationalization of industry to progress; economic planning to the elimination of 
crises; mounting indices in steel, coal and petroleum production to the 
well-being of the Russian people. In the meantime, fact progressively 
contravenes theory. The nationalization of Russian industry has not been marked 
by any sort of social progress. Russian economic planning &#8212; such as it is &#8212; has 
sharpened crises known to the capitalist world. And the mounting indices in 
heavy industry (little as we are actually permitted to know about them) have 
been accompanied by abject misery and worsening of conditions for the Russian 
people. To anyone informed of Russian social life, the contradiction between 
theory and reality has reached nightmarish proportions.</p>

<p class="fst">Moreover, just as theory has been used to distort the meaning of 
events, so events have revenged themselves on theory. The most vulgar prattling 
has been employed to override Russian reality from one aspect or another, and 
with it, the means for social analysis itself. One has only to examine the 
tortured ideas of Stalinism and its supporters on economic theory, aesthetics, 
and, often enough, even science, to judge the wholesale misapplication of 
thinking to all questions. The shoe is invariably placed on the wrong foot and 
the adherent is invited to limp through a host of broad economic, political, and 
cultural, as well as specifically Russian, problems. It becomes a social 
responsibility in every sense of the term to bring fact and theory into accord.</p>

<p class="fst">Although objective and systematic accounts have been available 
for some time, there has been a marked failure to employ them adequately for the 
purposes of generalization. By contrast, Stalinist theory was given the 
semblance of a certain unity and comprehensiveness. The rather popular notion 
that Russia is a 'managerial society' is unsatisfactory and starts from the same 
premises as the Stalinist approach. Both assume that Russia represents a 
historically-new social formation. The 'managerial theory', it is true, poses a 
significant issue: if the state exercises full control over the economy, it is 
necessary to ask &#8212; 'Who controls the state?' To this question, Stalinist 
apologists have no reply; unless we are to give serious credence to the benign 
'intentions' of the Russian leaders or to the claim that Russia has the most 
democratic constitution in the world. On the other hand, the 'managerial theory' 
explains little of the energizing forces of the Russian economy: of its dynamics 
and of Russian expansion abroad. From so purely negative a definition, developed 
in reaction to the incredibility of the Stalinist view rather than from a 
positive elucidation of the conditions of Russian material life, it would be 
difficult to find serious points of difference between a 'managerial society' 
and, for example, Ptolemaic Egypt. The position fails to bring anything into 
relief &#8212; it lacks an explanation of anything that is socially distinctive.</p>

<p class="fst">But if Russian society is not to be regarded as a 'new' 
historical stage, what does it represent?</p>

<p class="fst">The contention made here is that Russia is integrally tied to 
capitalist development, that its social system may be called state capitalism. 
Such a judgement follows from two considerations. The first and most general is 
the entire process of world capitalist development. The barbarization of 
society, so graphically represented by Fascism and its Stalinist predecessor, is 
anchored in the bourgeois mode of production. It requires absolutely no 
departure from an analysis of capitalist retrogression to explain all the 
phenomena of Stalinism. In point of fact, <i>Russia reflects this decline in 
every feature</i>. The second and more specific consideration is the 
backwardness of Russia. This historically-retarded development, suffice to say 
for the present, cannot be regarded as a bag of excuses for justifying 
'contemporary excesses' or, what amounts to the same thing, for keeping Russian 
society in suspended animation &#8212; free from the compulsion of social law. The 
'intentions' or wishes of the Stalin leadership &#8212; whatever they may be &#8212; may be 
disregarded. Under capitalism, backwardness has its own laws, by which Russia, 
like Germany, Italy and Spain (each in a certain sense) are relentlessly 
governed.</p>

<p class="fst">A discussion of Russia as a state capitalist system, therefore, 
presents the challenge of large issues. At every point, the analysis lends 
itself to homologous developments in England, America &#8212; indeed, in the entirety 
of capitalist society. Concretely, there is almost no special starting place. 
Developments in western Europe, among the 'democracies', suggest the same 
problems that in Russia have achieved only greater poignancy.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">Nationalization and the Background of Russian Capitalism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Russia to-day has a nationalized and, allegedly, planned economy. 
This has, by common consent, been regarded as the unique characteristic of 
Stalinist society; at once its point of departure from capitalism and its most 
'progressive' feature. Planning is, at most, a claim and may, for the moment, be 
put aside. The nationalization of industry, however, remains indisputable. The 
question at issue is: why is industrial nationalization, <i>per se</i>, 
non-capitalist or progressive?</p>

<p class="fst">It is true that nationalization, at least juridically, precludes 
the individual ownership of industrial enterprises. And such individual 
ownership has been associated with capitalism and its consequences &#8212; more 
generally, with private property in the means of production. But many 
civilizations have been known where state ownership of the productive forces, 
for one reason or another, became the dominant economic institution without in 
any conceivable sense eliminating problems engendered by individual property. 
Private property remained in the real sense that the control of the productive 
forces yielded the relatively autonomous decisions that characterize individual 
ownership.</p>

<p class="fst">The point to be made is that the apparent economic relationship 
of men to the productive forces must be explained by the economic relationship <i>
between</i> men. At all times, of course, a certain technological level is 
presupposed. Hunters, for example, cannot be expected to establish feudal social 
relations. But to borrow again from the fruitful analogy of the ancient world, 
the feudal social relations of Egypt dominated the transitions from the 
centralized, state-owned lands of the Old Kingdom, through the somewhat atomized 
Middle Kingdom, into the Empire and completely centralized economy of the 
Hellenistic Age. Throughout, the relationship between the broad mass of serfs 
and the ruling nobility and priesthood remained same. Although these changes met 
many real needs, feudal problems and relations persisted and dominated Egyptian 
society.</p>

<p class="fst">The point behind this analogy can be verified in the history of 
Russian capitalist development. </p>

<p class="fst">If European capitalism of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 
had room for development, Russian capitalism, due to its belated appearance, 
could find little sustenance in a precarious world market overcrowded by 
superior rivals, and in an internal market inhibited by feudal relations. True, 
Russian capitalism did not recapitulate the industrial and political history of 
Europe. From the start, it was in possession of a technically-advanced and 
highly concentrated plant. But from the nature of the situation, this contained 
as many disadvantages as advantages. Alongside the peasant, hungering for land 
of his own, was added the ferment of the new labouring classes, to which the 
insecure, restricted bourgeoisie was incapable of granting reforms. Fearing its 
own masses, confined by world imperialism which clung desperately (as the 
general situation worsened) to privileges acquired in an earlier period, 
incapable as a result of its weakness of effectively forcing its way into the 
perpetual race for markets, the Russian bourgeoisie was compelled to cement many 
of its ties with the Czarist regime. More often than not, this was a source of 
extreme frustration. The regime and nobility had its own fish to fry, and the 
relationship often presented the character of two dogs sharing a bone. But if 
the bourgeoisie <i>generally</i> strives to secure itself by concentration and 
monopolistic practices, the narrow margin of industrial survival imperatively <i>
dictated</i> the formation of great combines in Russia that increasingly 
paralleled and merged with the state. The two acted upon each other: as 
conditions worsened in the respective sphere of each, an interpenetration tended 
to occur.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">These were the tendencies of pre-revolutionary capitalist 
development. They must not be mistaken for a <i>fait accompli</i>. Quarrels, 
differences as to ways and means, eternal exasperation with the inefficiency of 
Czarism precipitated bitter and often violent controversies. Lurking behind 
these differences lay the prospect of an internal market, free from feudal 
restrictions. But lurking behind this market was the fear of a Jacquerie and an 
urban uprising which variously &#8212; but, on the whole, negatively &#8212; coloured the 
political activity of Russian capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">The focus of all Russian political activity, of course, was the 
countryside. Could the bourgeoisie 'imitate' its French brethren and give the 
land to the peasants? In point of fact, the French bourgeoisie had not 
liquidated the land problem. The breakdown of the feudal estates was consummated 
by the Jacobins at the cost of bloody conflicts with the capitalist class. Under 
the leadership of Robespierre, Danton and Hébert, the revolution had 
over-extended itself, gaining an indispensable margin for the play of radical 
social forces. In so doing, it managed to override the fears, rural interests 
and narrow conservatism of the bourgeoisie. But afterward the revolution 
retrenched, retreating to the only forms possible at the time.</p>

<p class="fst">This, it might be supposed, could also provide a model for the 
Russian Revolution. The parties of the Russian 'sans-culottes' would endeavour 
to establish a radical democracy, largely over and against the reactionary 
summits of Russian capitalism. Land would be distributed among the peasants and 
improved working conditions introduced in industry. The bourgeoisie, no doubt, 
would fume and storm. It might endeavour to raise another Lyons and the 
nobility, certainly, another Vendée. But the economic axis of such a revolution 
could only be the full extension of capitalist relations to the countryside. Its 
most obvious result: the creation of a firm peasantry at the expense of the 
feudal elements.</p>

<p class="fst">Certain sharp differences, however, are evident. The French 
Revolution occurred in 1789: the Russian Revolution, in 1917. The two were 
separated by a century and a quarter of capitalist development. The French 
Revolution coincided with the first upswing of the development; the Russian 
Revolution with its decline and retrogression. Both aspects of the cycle were 
planted in these events. In consequence, the Russian Revolution might give an 
initial &#8212; perhaps not inconsiderable &#8212; impetus to industrial activity. At worst, 
conditions would portend the tug-of-war and instability following the overthrow 
of the Spanish monarchy in 1931. But under bourgeois conditions, instability in 
Russia was inevitable. The whole character of world economic conditions nurtured 
the persistence and eventual growth of conditions that were already clearly in 
focus during the last years of Czarism. In effect, this meant increasing 
monopolization, state intervention to support sagging industries and, finally, 
the nationalization of industry and totalitarian policing of the standard of 
living.</p>

<p class="fst">This is essentially the gamut of Russian events after 1917. The 
conditions of the war precipitated a long standing crisis, pushing the feudal 
system into the abyss. They served to arouse hopes in the Lenin group that the 
inevitable over-extension of the democratic revolution would be consolidated 
economically by a different type of revolution in Europe. The ebb of the 
European revolution, however, left the Bolshevists with little more than what 
they had in any case: namely, a capitalist economy rounded out by land seizures 
in the countryside. The fact was clearly acknowledged by the New Economic Policy 
of 1921. An open market was not only recognized, but there is every indication 
to believe that a policy of tolerating small merchant and individual peasant 
enterprises was calculated for a length of time greater than permitted it by the 
Stalin regime.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> The nationalization of industry, while precipitately 
introduced on the strength of other, more radical hopes &#8212; as well, it may be 
agreed, as many immediate expediencies accelerated &#8212; an economic development 
which confronted Russian capitalism in any case.</p>

<p class="fst">There can be no question that we are simplifying events which 
might have at least retarded the depth of totalitarian development in Russia had 
a different insight prevailed. In England, for example, we are witnessing much 
the same line of development for industry. Left to itself, British capitalism is 
apparently moving with less of an edge than did the Stalinist reaction of 
1925-7. The possibilities for intervention are more pronounced than for Russia 
during those years. Further speculation as to the course of the Russian 
Revolution, however, can be left to those who are living with, rather than 
learning from, the past. It is only necessary to stress, here, the full 
coincidence of industrial nationalization with the entire background of Russian 
capitalist development. The presence of capitalism in Russia depends not on 
nationalization <i>per se</i> &#8212; which may reflect reaction and retrogression as 
well as progress &#8212; but on other factors, which accordingly make for one or the 
other.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">Capitalism in Russia</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The burden of any discussion of Russia as a state capitalist 
society devolves upon three issues: the existence and weight of competition, the 
anarchy bred by the 'Plan', and the difficulties, disproportions and crises in 
reproduction created by competition for sources of raw material and skilled 
labour. The consequences of these problems, even if considered only by 
themselves, are ramified through all channels of the economy with growing 
intensity and reach their summit in 'factional' struggles, disputes, 
liquidations and regroupings that &#8212; like the incessant jockeying for power among 
capitalist groups in Europe and America &#8212; have become characteristic of Russian 
life. The state, supporting the economy as a whole, reflecting by its function 
the weakness of the entire economic structure, becomes the arena in which the 
maladjustments of the system take form. It is not so much a 'Plan' that passes 
between the managers, supply agencies, Glavks (Glavks are administrative boards 
directly below People's Commissariats). and People's Commissariats, as 
antagonisms and rivalries between individual capitalists and blocs of 
capitalists attempting to secure and advance their positions.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In theory, the Russian manager is supposed to have very little 
independence. Dr. Marshak describes the position of the manager as follows:</p>

<p class="fst">'The Soviet manager is unable to manipulate freely the size of 
his plant or his inventories. Nor can he take advantage of market situations, 
current or prospective, by bargaining with sources of supplies or with customers 
for better prices, or by winning customers through low prices, and sources of 
supplies through high ones. To be sure, with supply chronically lagging behind 
demand, it would in any case be pointless for a manager to reduce prices in 
order to win customers. On the other hand, to win preference for a source of 
supplies by bidding up prices for raw materials would not be pointless. &#8212; But it 
is forbidden.'<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Russian law, or the official administration of industry, suggests 
an even more severe picture. Sales contracts, plant property, production and 
labour efficiency norms, the number of workers to be employed, average earnings 
and the annual payroll &#8212; in fact, nearly every detail of the industrial process 
is supposed to require state approval. Where this is not pure juridical fiction, 
it affords a restricted picture. It would be surprising to conclude that all 
elements in Russian capitalism reflect a homogeneous pattern of status and 
economic control. The capitalists of Russia, like those elsewhere, maintain 
variegated relationships among themselves. Many are subject to the crass 
authority of higher elements. Others, probably managers of large, heavy 
industrial enterprises, are relatively independent. Assuredly, the People's 
Commissars, the Ministers and those who are so situated as seriously to 
influence the power relationships between competing blocs, correspond to the 
monopolists and commanding bourgeois elements of western capitalist states. 
Different 'frames of reference', therefore, exhibit different views. To a purely 
juridical mind, German and Russian economic regulations seem to agree point by 
point. If we were not familiar with the clearly capitalistic nature of the 
German economy under Hitler, Nazi law would engender the belief that the German 
economy reflects some sort of 'managerial society'. From the standpoint of 
lesser managers, or those who have not ferreted out the possibilities inherent 
in any given situation, the full burden of the totalitarian regulations descends 
on their shoulders. To be sure, Stalinist society is more centralized than 
elsewhere. But by the same token, influence, power, exploitation and competition 
is more severe.</p>

<p class="fst">It would be absolutely unpardonable and superficial to discount 
the influence of the plant manager as a member of the Party, his connections in 
the government, and, above all, the countless tricks and manoeuvres included in 
such relationships. But even according to juridical arrangements, the manager is 
no mere automaton of the planning bodies and state. Bienstock, discussing the 
growth and recognition of managerial independence, writes: 'Most important, the 
manager became the only person responsible for the operation of the plant in all 
its subdivisions. The manager's authority within the plant has increased. He 
rules the whole production process, bears responsibility for the technological 
process, for quantitative fulfilment of the plan, and for the quality of the 
goods produced. ... '<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> Since 1938, a sinking fund is withdrawn from plant 
output &#8212; estimated at about 5 per cent. of initial capital value &#8212; 40 to 60 per 
cent. of which is at the manager's disposal for capital replacement as well as 
repairs. The manager, even according to economic regulations, disposes of 
considerable resources at any given plant level. It is obvious that the lure of 
a more commanding position, in a country where disproportions in income are 
matched only by the extremities of want, creates and even necessitates bitter 
competition for further access to such resources.</p>

<p class="fst">The position of the Russian manager gains greater reality when 
the authority he possesses is dynamized by the actual relationship of plant 
production to the 'Plan'.</p>

<p class="fst">Planning in Russia has either been grossly exaggerated or totally 
misunderstood. This has, in so many words, been admitted in the day to day 
reports of the Russian press itself &#8212; all theoretical pronunciamentos and 
considerations aside. 'Our planning is still to a great extent clerical and 
statistical work', reports Meizenberg, 'absolutely divorced from economic 
practice.'<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> In this connection, Bienstock observes: 'The practice of planning 
has gradually brought the leaders of Soviet economy to the conclusion that tasks 
set by plan must be adjusted in accordance with practice, that planning cannot 
be confined to orders but requires continual checking in every phase of 
production. In theory, these rules were formulated unequivocally, long ago. As a 
matter of fact, principles were not applied until the outbreak of war in the 
summer of 1941.'<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> The remark gains significance because it is now known that, 
if anything, planning was considerably relaxed during the war conditions. On an 
earlier page, the same writer notes that 'Many plants have been given the 
initiative in working out their own production programmes in line with 
directives of the previous years, without waiting for new orders from above; 
they transmit their programmes to the Glavk or directly to the People's 
Commissariat. The Glavk checks and, if necessary changes plans, taking into 
account supply possibilities unknown to the plant, the possibility of 
co-operation between plants, financial resources, regional needs, etc.'<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Russian manager must operate outside the 'Plan'. 'Commodity 
funds (stocks) are often apportioned only five or six days before the beginning 
of a quarter: &quot;realization&quot; (delivery) is sometimes greatly delayed. Ordinarily, 
delivery is obtained only towards the end of a quarter, say in its last three or 
four weeks. The amount of goods apportioned for a quarter is almost below a 
plant's real needs, <i>because the People's Commissariat and Glavk usually fear 
that the manager's application for goods</i>, <i>especially scarce materials</i>, <i>
is exaggerated</i>.' (Bienstock &#8212; our emphasis, M.S.)<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> Again: 'To obtain 
goods, he (the manager) must often send representatives to supplying factories 
or to agencies of People's Commissariats and Glavks. Many plants have permanent 
representatives in Moscow or other supply centres with the special task of 
securing the timely supply of goods, of &quot;pushing&quot; orders for materials, of 
arranging shipments, etc. And, of course, the plant management must maintain a 
storage organization. A plant manager who does not get needed goods in time is 
often compelled to break rules and seek new ways to supply his plant. There is 
thus a contradiction between theory and practice. Theory has, recently taken a 
few steps toward practice, e.g., the direct agreements.'<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> The author cites 
several examples to illustrate the magnitude of these problems (and, we may add, 
operations). ' &quot;During the first eight months of 1940, the Tractor Works spent 
200,000 roubles on telegrams and 250,000 roubles on travelling expenses.&quot; The 
same story was told half a year later of another giant plant, the Rostov Works 
for Agricultural Engineering. ...'<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> In the course of several articles on 
Russia in the <i>Herald Tribune</i>, Newman cites <i>Izvestia</i> to the effect 
that <i>one third</i> of the ten thousand daily arrivals in Moscow by railway 
and plane were on 'unnecessary' government business. <i>Izvestia</i> makes the 
accusation that these arrivals waste millions of rubles in sprees and 
excursions.</p>

<p class="fst">An entire body of market relations underlies the reproductive 
mechanism of Russian industry. According to Bienstock, the '... turn-over of 
many supply organizations, particularly local offices, is so insignificant that 
they are compelled to transgress their jurisdiction to justify their existence. 
They buy materials and equipment not needed in their own branch of industry and 
sell to plants of other branches. They become, in a sense, ordinary 
dealers.'<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> The reports that consistently appear in the Russian Press are only 
a surface picture of idle plants or factories working far under capacity, while 
goods and raw materials circulate throughout the country without any apparent 
destination ... other, undoubtedly, than a profitable buyer. The incidents are 
notorious, frequently embracing some of the most important industrial projects 
of the Stalinist regime. An example cited by Bienstock is worth quoting in full: 
'On 3rd June, 1938, the Council of People's Commissars issued a decree 
concentrating sale of ferrous metals in a new Board. Some six months later, the 
head of this board, S. Volikov, complained about &quot;individualistic methods&quot; of 
procuring metals. Metals were sent from one end of the Union to the other 
without reason or plan. Often large quantities were brought from the Urals or 
Krivoi Rog (Ukraine) to Moscow as a storage and supply centre, only to retrace a 
portion of the original route to get to a consumer.'<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> How often? How 'large' 
were the quantities? Volikov, apparently, did not say. But like the daily 
'sprees' to Moscow (and only to Moscow?) there is good reason to believe that 
such 'infractions' are enormous; in our opinion, decisive. Harry Schwartz, for 
example, recently reported in the <i>N.Y. Times</i> that complaints in the 
Russian Press indicate one-third (another third) of the secretaries of 
collective farms in the Ukraine were transgressing the rights of collective farm 
members in 'violation' of the law. Newman, again, reports charges in <i>Pravda</i> 
that 'heaps' of vegetables and fruits were spoiling on railway platforms of the 
South Western, North Caucasian, Moscow-Kiev, Tashkent, Askhabad and 
Turkestan-Siberian lines in 1947. At the same time, it is indicated, the 
periodical <i>Bolshevik</i> claimed that <i>20 per cent.</i> of railway stock 
was idle and an even higher proportion was the case for motor transport!</p>

<p class="fst">Throughout, profit reigns supreme. 'The government ...' writes 
Yugow, 'fixes the factory price for some item at 20 roubles, viz., 14 roubles 
production costs, 2 roubles planned profit, and 4 roubles (20 per cent.) 
turnover tax. If plant management reduces the cost from 14 to, say, 10 roubles, 
the profit becomes 6 roubles, of which 2 are planned profit and 4 &quot;above the 
Plan&quot;.'<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> From this it follows: 'The desire to increase profits has become a 
real incentive to more responsible, active, and careful management.'<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> Yugow 
provides us with examples from heavy industry: 'In coal mining, for each per 
cent. of reduction of real cost of production below planned cost, the manager, 
assistant manager, chief and assistant engineers get a bonus of 15 per cent. of 
monthly salary. In iron and steel industry, the figure is 10 per cent. 
Furthermore, for each per cent. of overfulfilment of planned output, the bonus 
for a coal-mine manager and his immediate assistants is 4 per cent. of salary. 
In iron and steel, bonuses for extra output are calculated progressively. If 
pig-iron production exceeds Plan by 5 per cent., the monthly salaries of a 
section head, assistant section head, engineer and electrical engineer are 
raised 10 per cent., for each per cent. of excess output. If the production 
excess is 10 per cent., the bonus for each per cent. of excess output is 15 per 
cent. of monthly salary, etc. ... No less important is the effect of plant 
profits on managerial influence, prestige and power.'<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The distinction between managers and capitalists or between 
bonuses and profits seems to be blurred by the information at our disposal. Does 
it mean, as the 'managerial theory' implies, that all capitalists become 
managers; that profits, in the socially-significant sense of the term, become 
mere bonuses?</p>

<p class="fst">Actually, this is only a pseudo-problem. Between the extremes of 
an industrial manager in a small, circumscribed shoe-factory and a People's 
Commissar, the distinction is quite clear. It is necessary that the 'spectrum' 
of Russian industrial authority be viewed under the aspect of qualitative 
differences rather than similarities that blend one shade of control into 
another. If the premises of competition, disproportions, direct agreements, 
etc., are granted, we need only compare the historical effect of Stalinist 
society with those produced in known capitalist sectors of the world. Should 
they coincide, the ostensible 'chain' of authority that juridical fiction 
reduces to the common denominator of 'manager' <i>requires</i> the assumption of 
differentiation between managers and capitalists. The presence of specific 
social forces and their effects summons, as it were, the ruling class and its 
capitalistic character &#8212; concealed (at most only to economic theoreticians) by 
the impersonality of the system and the anonymity of the regime &#8212; into real 
life. Neither the propaganda of the apologists nor the 'intentions' of their 
leaders can alter such indispensable distinctions.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">Russia and the Retrogression of Capitalism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">At first glance, a comparison between Russia and trends in world 
capitalism presents many divergencies. Among these, the most conspicuous are:</p>

<p class="fst">First, the decline in the standard of living ,on an international 
scale. Stalinist propaganda, on the other hand, celebrates a steady rise in the 
well-being of the Russian masses. The comparison, we are reminded, must be made 
between pre-revolutionary and contemporary Russia rather than between Russia and 
advanced capitalist states. Once this criterion is adopted, we are assured, 
there can be 'no doubt' that the material conditions of the people have improved 
steadily.</p>

<p class="fst">Second, since imperialism is characterized by the export of 
capital, Russia cannot be viewed as an imperialist state. This, once stated, 
often seems to suffice. Russian expansion is ascribed to military exigencies, 
the fear of war, the desire to spread 'communism', etc. &#8212; but not to imperialism 
in the scientific sense of the term.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, all accounts of Russia never cease to point to the 
continual, 'unprecedented' growth of industry at a time when the tendency 
elsewhere has long been toward industrial contraction. The endless panegyrics, 
at least, indicate mounting, swollen statistics in every field of production. 
Each five year plan is completed in four years, and every plan is made to mark a 
milestone over earlier conditions. This has even impressed opponents of the 
regime &#8212; so we are told by friends of the regime.</p>

<p class="fst">By separating crass fact from pure fiction and qualitative 
analysis from the blinding storm of meaningless statistics, a second glance 
discloses basic similarities between Russia and world capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">1. <i>The standard of living in Russia</i>. Now on this question, 
there are sound reasons for believing that if the material conditions of the 
masses have shown a steady improvement, Russia is a striking exception to the 
trends in world capitalism. In an economy based on competition, only a 
cold-blooded selection by destruction operates. To exist, in effect, means to 
survive; and to survive means to absorb rival capitals. The 'ideal' of bourgeois 
'enterprise' is full control over the productive process and market. This alone, 
the system dictates, can assure survival, and provide the security and stability 
which all elements of the system continually endeavour to achieve. In time, the 
elements of the system change their character. Numerous capitalists are 
transformed into a handful of large capitalists, commanding whole branches of 
industry, national monopolies and international cartels. The growth of 
monopolies and cartels only serves to intensify the degree of rivalry and 
instability. Huge masses of capital, formerly controlled by many individuals, 
are now pitted against each other by a few monopolists. The system must increase 
its demands upon all the means at its disposal; demands, in turn, which are 
always insufficient to meet the growing dimensions of the struggle. Reforms, 
permissible in an earlier context, are withdrawn; exploitation is intensified; 
living standards are depressed.</p>

<p class="fst">Oddly enough, the Stalinist regime has maintained a statistical 
conspiracy against the apprehension of facts concerning the standard of living 
in Russia. Despite much official propaganda, photography and guided tours of 
pre-war vintage, we are aware of no official indices tracing the material 
conditions of the people in any way comparable to the information provided by 
most, if not all, capitalist countries. So far as direct analysis admits, the 
economic position of the masses is shrouded in mystery; cast in vague 
proportionate accounts and classified into statistically-useless categories. The 
indirect analysis of Russian data, however, is of remarkable interest. On the 
basis of Hubbard's data comparing the average food consumption of Petrograd 
textile families during Czarist days with later periods, Peter Meyer has 
demonstrated that between 1929 and 1937 the average standard of living declined 
to 34 per cent. below pre-revolutionary days. The same analysis shows an 
increase of 54 per cent. from the Revolution to 1929.<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Material in Colin Clark's studies of Russian statistics show a 
decrease of around 20 per cent. in food consumption per head between 1913 and 
1934.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> Whatever the differences between both analyses, the depth of the 
downward trend is unmistakable. To bring matters as much up to date as is 
possible, Vera Micheles Dean observes &#8212; again, on the basis of an indirect 
analysis of Russian <i>nominal</i> wages (!) &#8212; that 'if 1938 is taken as a 100, 
the index of increase in nominal wages is 165 and 175, depending on the 
categories of work. Owing to the continuance of high prices, however, and to 
various curbs recently [1947 &#8212; M.S.] placed on individual purchases real wages 
have actually undergone a sharp decline.'<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Recent Press reports from Russia indicate that the regime has 
placed the monetary policy on the Gold Standard, accompanied by 'drastic' price 
reductions. We must confess that on the basis of previous 'price reduction' 
policies, we view this latest 'achievement' with considerable scepticism. On 
16th September, 1945, for example, the price structure was also overhauled. Miss 
Dean observes: 'The price of certain essential rationed goods were sharply 
raised on an average of 180 per cent. over previous prices &#8212; with the effect of 
further draining off money in circulation. By contrast, prices of unrationed 
goods in commercial government stores were reduced by 30 to 55 per cent. While 
the upward revision of prices of rationed goods and the downward revision of 
unrationed goods were intended to close the gap between the two sets of prices 
[an incredible explanation by the regime! - M.S.] the gap remains 
substantial.&quot;<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> It is reasonable to question if the gap is being closed by 
lowering or raising the price of commodities within the purchasing range of the 
masses. Thus, on 17th July, 1948, the Stalinist government announced a 10 to 20 
per cent. reduction of prices in state stores. The reduction was confined to 
such items as bicycles, phonographs, watches, caviar, Moskvich automobiles, 
hunting guns, cameras, perfumes, cosmetics, stoves and ... beer and vodka.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the infamous currency 'reform' of December, 1947, prices 
remained essentially the same as before except for bread and a few staple items. 
W. Bedell Smith notes that the tremendous hardships imposed by the production 
norms established for 1950 led to such demoralization that the Government had to 
change 'its production plans to increase the amount of consumer goods available 
for purchases. ... These measures gradually improved the production situation 
to the point where the Government finally felt able to act drastically to lower 
the purchasing power of the Soviet people in order to reduce the general demand 
for consumers' goods and relieve the pressure on light industry. The currency 
reform undertaken in December, 1947, accomplished this. The existing ruble 
currency was declared obsolete without warning and new currency was issued that 
was exchanged at the rate of one new ruble for ten old rubles. State bonds were 
devaluated by two thirds. Bank deposits, however, were exchangeable at equal 
value, but only up to 3,000 rubles with a smaller return on larger amounts. Food 
rationing was removed at the same time.</p>

<p class="fst">'The farmers were wiped out, as their money was not in banks but 
in state bonds and currency. To pay taxes and meet current expenses, they sold 
food, so that for a brief period immediately after the monetary change there was 
a flood of food in city markets for the first time in years. This lasted only a 
short time, and thereafter the industrial workers found that an even more 
drastic form of rationing actually existed, as only a limited quantity of each 
kind of food was sold to one person.'<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> The same 'rationing' apparently did 
not apply, so far as we know, in the commercial government stores catering to 
the Stalinist millionaires, where white bread was easily obtainable at 7.5 times 
the value of the same type of bread 'for sale' in regular stores. But is it 
necessary to enter into the income differentials of an economy which bountifully 
provides for the few who are privileged with truly astronomical incomes?</p>

<p class="fst">2. <i>Imperialism and the export of capital</i>. In this 
connection, there has been so much misunderstanding, that a number of general 
remarks are in order.</p>

<p class="fst">The course of capitalist development evokes many contradictions 
that shape and give it form. Since competition requires the steady replacement 
of labour by machinery, at least two simultaneous effects are evident. The rate 
of profit declines and millions are deprived of employment. As the internal 
market contracts, the entire productive process tends to follow in its wake.</p>

<p class="fst">Attempts to compensate for this contraction turn the bourgeoisie 
to the international market particularly the super-profits of colonial trade and 
industry. It is apparent, of course, that capitalism always endeavoured to reap 
these imperial profits. The wealth derived from colonial exploitation was a 
prerequisite for the primitive accumulation that launched capitalist development 
in the modern era. The point to be made, however, is that when the internal 
market contracts, imperialism comes into its own as an imperative force, an 
absolute precondition for the very life of the system. For a while, imperialism 
yields a spurt to the economy, extending the limits of the internal market and 
providing new bases for industrial expansion. But in time this engenders further 
contradictions: the obstacle of new, rival imperialisms and of entrenched 
predecessors; increasing exhaustion due to frequent conflicts, etc.</p>

<p class="fst">In its 'classic' period, imperialism was characterized by the 
export of capital.<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> This, perhaps, more than the paeans of Kipling, 
encouraged many liberal economists to believe that the 'white man's burden' 
could only mean the full industrial development of the colonial world. Actually, 
capital export was invariably one-sided, calculated not to develop a competitor 
but so to upset aboriginal social relations that dependence, rather than 
independence, was emphasized. The effect of imperialism, therefore, has always 
been to create so much misery and discontent, that national uprisings (of one 
degree or another) continually follow in its wake. As the contradictions of 
capitalist imperialism converge into a general crisis, the export of capital is 
subordinated entirely to the needs of colonial regimentation, policing and 
control. A sort of Roman parasitism prevails. All the material and spiritual 
sources of resistance are numbed by planned starvation and terror. Masses of 
population created by the capitalist mode of production are reduced, enslaved or 
exterminated. Industrial activity is rendered more and more one-sided and 
dependent, or &#8212; in many cases &#8212; comes to a virtual standstill.</p>

<p class="fst">Many colonies have long since travelled part of the road to this 
new barbarism. Indeed, the prototype of contemporary enslavement and 
exploitation was nurtured for generations on the continents of Asia, Africa, 
South America and in the archipelagoes of the Orient. But the colonial countries 
do not stand alone. Under the heightened conditions of present-day rivalry and 
instability, even the industrially-advanced nations of Europe face oppression 
and reduction to a colonial status. Europe enjoys the 'special status' wherein 
her stabilization involves no less than the physical destruction of much of her 
industry. Thus, the 'Iron Heel' German capitalism prepared for Europe now 
descends upon Germany. Industries are destroyed, millions bombed out and 
permanently uprooted. The country is dismembered and occupied by foreign 
imperialist armies. The 'loser' of the last war, however, is only the harbinger 
of conditions that await nearly all the 'victors' of to-day. Eastern Europe 
already shares the fate of Germany; England, France, Belgium &#8212; all progressively 
become the economic and political instruments of American policy. The economic 
one-sidedness and dependency that are imposed on the colonial world eventually 
face the earlier colonial oppressors themselves. The international market, like 
the internal market, contracts; all social existence threatens to shrivel and 
decline.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is in this milieu &#8212; that is, under the conditions and 
possibilities created by the second World War &#8212; that Russia definitely embarked 
upon an imperialist course. Initially, this took form in collaboration with 
fascist Germany, If the seizure of territory from Finland, Poland and Rumania is 
often excused by military 'expediency', further negotiations with the Nazis 
concerning the hinterlands of Asia leave absolutely no doubt as to the 
imperialist character of Russian expansion. Ribbentrop's appreciation of Russian 
'natural spheres of influence' is very concise:</p>

<p class="fst">'The focal points in the territorial aspiration of the Soviet 
Union would presumably be centred south of the territory of the Soviet Union in 
the direction of the Indian Ocean.'<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">To-day, the imperialist activities of the Stalinist regime occur, 
as is the case with the rest of Europe, under the shadow cast by the polarized, 
concentrated power of the United States. Beside this 'American colossus', 
rivalry must generally find circuitous routes: infiltrate into weak positions; 
operate in the crevices and around the fringes of American control. The 
phenomenal privileges allocated to Russia, however, are explicable only in terms 
of the political limitations of the United States. The Stalinist regime largely 
holds those positions where the need for the naked application of force places 
the bourgeois-democracy of the United States at a current disadvantage. To 
employ the more precise formulation of Ernst Zander: 'The secret of the 
situation, as of America's weakness, consists in Russia having become her most 
reliable and indispensable policeman in Europe and Asia. It is predominantly 
from this that Russia derives her 'astounding' strength in the haggling with 
other Powers &#8212; no other country can be entrusted with the ruthless police 
function once the Stalin regime collapses.'<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a> In effect, the Stalinist regime 
complements and is, for the present, <i>indispensable</i> to American 
imperialism. As in 1939, Stalinism remains a precondition for world reaction and 
retrogression; in the first case, precipitating World War II, and to-day, 
assuming the functions of Hitler during the thirties.</p>

<p class="fst">In this context, where expansion goes hand-in-hand with total 
parasitism dictated by rivalry and survival, where the dismemberment and 
exploitation of advanced capitalist countries makes its appearance, the export 
of excess capital resources becomes an ancillary feature of imperialism.</p>

<p class="fst">3. <i>The growth of Russian industry.</i> If Russian industrial 
development means anything, it refers first and foremost to armaments 
industries. Much the same can be said for the entire capitalist world. The 
armament industry is, to-day, the lubricant of the entire system and growingly 
extends over consumer goods production precisely because it, alone, can co-exist 
with a falling standard of living. Guns, tanks, aircraft &#8212; weapons of all kind &#8212; 
explode in waste. They require only the intervention of the state as a 
purchaser. The state, on the other hand, becomes a buyer by virtue of the 
revenue it exacts from the system as a whole; principally, by milking the masses 
dry in true publican fashion. In the United States, this essentially takes the 
form of taxation; in England, rationing and wage fixing; finally, in Russia and 
Germany, naked police supervision over the living standards of the people. The 
poverty of the masses is 'planned' &#8212; and this, by far, is the major function of 
planning.</p>

<p class="fst">As greater recourse is had to direct measures, the more armaments 
are required to keep the masses in subjugation. These operations occur on a 
world scale: occupation armies, arms for docile elements abroad, etc. To be 
sure, profits too require distribution (again: 'planning') to sustain the state 
as the essential agent for, and market of, the system. In this rule, the state 
frequently appears as the disciplinarian of contending bourgeois blocs. Although 
by no means the most desirable situation for elements accustomed to a 
laissez-faire economy, choices cease to exist. The system must be sustained as a 
whole.</p>

<p class="fst">Despite the fact that the Stalinist regime came very close to 
defeat in 1941-42, it compared only with Germany as a producer of armaments 
during pre-war years. Between 1934-39, Russian armament expenditure was twice 
that of England. 'It seems likely,' writes Prof. A. J. Brown, '... that the 
Soviet Union spent at least as much on military purposes in the five years or so 
before she was attacked as Germany had spent in the corresponding period leading 
up to her aggression against Poland. Germany's two-year lead in this race, 
however, gave her a formidable advantage; at the time of her attack on the USSR 
her military expenditure was probably still at least twice that of Russia though 
not all of it &#8212; perhaps little more than two thirds, could be applied on the 
eastern front. ... Whatever the margin of error in the calculation, it is 
clear that the real cost of military preparation to the Soviet Union was, like 
the subsequent burden which it bore in battle casualties, the heaviest carried 
by any nation.'<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">By examination of mere surface facts, economists judge that 
expenditures on armaments comprised 6 per cent. of Russian national income in 
1934; 12 per cent. in 1937; 25 per cent. shortly before the German invasion; and 
&#8212; according to recent estimates in <i>Life</i> magazine &#8212; 25 per cent. 
to-day.<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> These assumptions are much too cordial. We submit that the Russian 
economy, from the very logic of the system, is oriented as a whole toward 
armament production; that proportions, estimates and statistical juggling are 
entirely meaningless. This situation gestates in capitalist development itself &#8212; 
even in such bastions of industry as the United States. Armament production is 
the life fluid of the bourgeois mode of production, the co-efficient of all 
industrial output, the one dollar that keeps the other three, four, five or ten 
in motion. In Russia, however, such determinations are already fruitless. 
Armaments are the absolute foundation of the economy itself; the Moloch to which 
all resources are delivered &#8212; the sacrificial altar of all industrial 
development.</p>

<p class="fst">It becomes absurd, from this standpoint, to regard the index of 
Russian production as any hopeful sign of progressive possibilities. Steel, in 
Russia, means guns or the means for making guns. If supporters of the Stalin 
regime hope that perhaps (and not without a revolution against the regime) the 
Russian people can be induced to use bayonets for buttering bread, then it may 
be supposed that they will dwell in cities of tanks, wear the drab grey of the 
army uniform and use helmets for toilet bowls. ...</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">The Slave State</a></h3>

<p class="fst">During the depths of the economic crisis, almost two decades ago, 
letters to the American Press opined that the unemployed should be placed on 
unseaworthy rafts and set adrift. In principle, the suggestion was not original. 
Although required by German fascism ten years later (efficiency often dictating 
crematoria), it was long anticipated in the slave labour camps of Stalinist 
Russia.<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a> For more than a quarter century, Russian capitalism has followed the 
relentless logic inherent in contemporary world development. Through countless 
purges, 'liquidations' and 'collectivization' drives, it has literally 
appropriated the bodies of millions of men, women and children whom the 
contracting system can no longer support on the basis of anything remotely 
resembling a free labour market. Like chained gangs on ancient latifundia, they 
are placed to work in the bleak hells of Siberia, in mines and on wastes where 
life is scarcely maintainable and quickly passes out of existence. From the 
Caspian Sea to the Solovietsky Islands on the White Sea, hopeless masses of 
human beings, living and dying under unbearable conditions, are devoured by the 
camp system. Whole areas like the gold-mining region of Kolyma, are entirely 
'populated' by chattel slaves, comprising every profession and vocation, 
occupying camps on the dimensions of cities (Magadan, for example), serviced, 
maintained and renewed by the system. The law of population under moribund 
capitalism dictates that millions, pushed outside society by the general 
contraction, must be worked to death.</p>

<p class="fst">But the individual merely perpetuates the species which, 
locust-like, slowly consumes all before it. For each who perishes, two appear. 
Slave workers recruit slave technicians; the technicians recruit slave 
engineers; these, in turn, are followed by guards, factories and more camps. The 
new mode of labour reproduces itself not only from the inner crisis of 
capitalism, but from the division of labour in modern industry. It recreates the 
entire juridical, political and economic fabric &#8212; adapting all institutions to 
its needs and, by giving rise to its own qualitative forms, threatens to negate 
the capitalist mode of production itself.</p>

<p class="fst">Slave labour already germinates in every phase of the Russian 
economy. The internal passport, the work-book, countless labour regulations 
ranging from 'job lateness' to 'sabotage', compulsory vocational training, etc., 
etc. &#8212; all reduce the industrial worker to a captive of his specific job.<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a> On 
the 'collective' farms, practically every pretence is cast to the winds. Yugow 
makes the following significant observation of the Russian kolkhoz system:</p>

<p class="fst">'Productive machinery, with the exception of small tools, belongs 
as already mentioned to the government, which, by agreement, works the land and 
harvests for the kolkhozes. Labour is furnished by the kolkhoz, which, in 
addition, is obliged to assign a specified percentage of its manpower to certain 
compulsory tasks (road work, transportation, felling timber, etc.) and to work 
in urban factories.'<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Centuries ago, capitalism took form in mediaeval Europe. By 
developing the instruments of production, the possibility was poised for a 
historic solution to want and exploitation. With the first World War, the curve 
of capitalist development took a downward turn; and here, history has reached 
the heights of irony. Alongside the most remarkable technological achievements, 
undreamed of advances in electronics, servo-mechanisms, turbo-engines and 
nuclear physics (in a word, all the means of lightening human labour) reappear 
the institutions, want, and exploitation of the past, infinitely intensified. 
Literally: moribund capitalism generates its own negation in the forms of a 
dark, barbaric past, when the material bases of mankind lay at the threshold of 
pre-history. The system converges toward stability on the shambles of whole 
cultures. Industry, as it were, 'thrives' in laboratories surrounded by a desert 
of human agony and hunger, only to achieve florescence in ... armaments. All the 
ingenuity of mankind &#8212; from science, communications and technology to the 
products of the printing press and the paint-brush &#8212; conspire to suck every 
isolated or remote community into the rising slave state. Indeed, as compared 
with the Stalinist regime, which can be considered no more than a mirror of 
relentless developments in Europe and America (if authentic democratic forces 
fail to intervene), the particularness of past mediaevalism will appear as a 
veritable haven for the human spirit.</p>

<h3><a name="h5">Footnotes:</a></h3>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1]</a> Although Czarist Russia ranked far behind the West 
industrially, the concentration of Russian industry exceeded the United States' 
during corresponding periods. In 1910 for example, enterprises employing 500 
workers or more comprised 53 per cent. of the number of workers in industry, as 
compared with 33 per cent. in the United States. During the first decade of the 
century, such concerns increased from 46.7 per cent. to 53.5 per cent., while 
factories employing up to 50 workers, and others from 50 to 500, declined from 
14.3 percent. to 11.6 per cent., and from 39 per cent. to 34 per cent. 
respectively. The specific weight of larger enterprises showed greater gains 
between 1901 and 1910. Enterprises employing over 500 workers jumped from 3.5 
per cent. to 5 per cent. of Russian industry. Those ranging up to 50 workers 
dropped from 70.5 per cent. to 65.7 per cent. </p>

<p class="endnote">Monopolies definitely appeared in the career of Russian industry 
as early as the 'eighties (the sugar industry), although precedents had been 
established by life insurance companies about a decade earlier. After the turn 
of the century, 70 to 75 per cent. of all sheet metal works were in the hands of 
a metallurgical monopoly: 'Prodamet'. By 1908 'Prodamet' held a dozen of the 
major metallurgical plants in its grasp, having expanded in the meantime into 
many metal products. Along with the 'Trubopradazha' syndicate (pipes) and the 
'Prodarud' syndicate (ores), nearly all of south Russian metallurgy was 
monopolized in less than ten years.</p>

<p class="endnote">Monopolies spread all over the country and to all branches of 
industry and transport. The 'Committee of Ural Ore and Metal Plants' syndicated 
80 per cent. of roofing iron. Farm machinery concerns combined in 1907 to 
regulate at least 72 per cent. of many agricultural implements. Ninety-five per 
cent. of railway cars were produced by the 'Prodvagon' syndicate in 1907, to be 
matched by 90 per cent. of locomotive production from another syndicate. The 
'Med' syndicate controlled 97 percent. of copper production (1913); 'Produgul' 
(1906) accounted for 75 per cent. of southern coal output; a petroleum syndicate 
encompassed 65 per cent oil production, etc. Monopolies appeared in light 
industry as well as heavy industry; in commerce as well as transport.</p>

<p class="endnote">Although many Russian syndicates were interlocked with, and often 
controlled by, foreign capital, there can be no question that the Czarist regime 
was the major support of industrial monopoly. Russian petroleum combines leaned 
on, and were aided enormously by, the state in competitive struggles with 
Standard Oil. In the person of Bunge, Vyshnegradsky and Witte, the government 
consciously abetted the development and concentration of industry. Heavy orders, 
for all practical purposes, formed so many subsidies to every branch of 
metallurgy. Correspondingly, direct intervention by the state formed a 
conspicuous part of Russian economic operations. Alcoholic beverages were a 
near-monopoly of the regime. The government owned and processed the output of 
many mines in Siberia, the Altai and the Urals. State activity was felt in 
communications (railway and telegraph), credit (the major banking concerns were 
owned by the state), forestry, large-scale agriculture, etc. By the time of the 
Revolution, the state and the bourgeoisie were interlinked in every phase of 
industry.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n2" href="#fn2">[2]</a> The remarks of Lenin, in this connection, are of interest: 'We 
are no longer attempting to break up the old social economic order, with its 
trade, its small scale economy and private initiative, its capitalism, but we 
are now trying to revive trade, private enterprise and capitalism, at the same 
time gradually and cautiously subjecting them to state regulation just as far as 
they revive.' (Lenin, <i>Pravda</i>, 7th November, 1921.)</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n3" href="#fn3">[3]</a> Naturally, this also applies to Britain, where the Labour 
Party presents its nationalization programme as a step toward social progress. 
This programme, there can be no question, abets the introduction of many 
totalitarian features, first adopted in Russia.</p>

business-like standpoint. ... Take, for example, Comrades Mirzoyan and Vainov.

<p class="endnote"><a name="n12" href="#fn12">[12]</a> Ibid., p. 64. Under the headline, 'Supply Woes Cut Soviet 
Production', Mr. Harry Schwartz (not to be confused with Solomon Schwarz of the 
work cited in the foregoing) gives the following report:</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%">'Leningradskaya Pravda recently printed an article by a factory 
director in Leningrad complaining of the harm done to production by supply 
difficulties. Needed materials often arrive late, forcing factories to cease or 
partly curtail output. ... In Leningrad alone, the article reports, hundreds of 
government officials employ thousands of persons who are supposed to facilitate 
necessary transactions between different enterprises. But these work so poorly 
and are of so little help that many factories have to spend large sums foraging 
for themselves so that their work can continue.</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%">'The situation is so bad, the director writes, that to meet its 
needs for electric lamps, motors, transformers, optical equipment and forgings, 
his factory has had to institute production of these items itself. At the same 
time, he says, Leningrad has large factories producing all these items, 
factories that are by no means always working at capacity.</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%">'At the root of the situation, he declares, is the overly 
bureaucratic organization of the Soviet industrial supply system. Factories 
adjacent to each other are not allowed to make arrangements directly to supply 
each other's needs if they belong to different ministries. These and other 
restrictions on enterprise managers' initiative tie them hand and foot, he 
complains, and must be removed if matters are to be improved.</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%">'A similar situation exists in the local consumer goods industry 
in Moscow, the newspaper Moscovskaya Pravda reports.</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%">'The supply system for these enterprises is working so badly that 
it is estimated that they will fail to receive about 600,000,000 rubles worth of 
raw materials that they require, about one-third their total needs. Because of 
the lack of materials, these enterprises will not be able to achieve this year's 
output plans for such goods as furniture, phonographs, children's bicycles, 
aluminium utensils and knitted goods.</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%">'To get around supply difficulties, some factories in Moscow do 
not produce articles for which they are best fitted, but only such goods for 
which they are able to obtain materials.</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%">'Another consequence of the materials shortage, Moskovskaya 
Pravda reveals, has been the development of large scale illegal barter trade 
between enterprises. Hundreds of middlemen &#8212; known colloquially as &quot;clever lads&quot; 
or &quot;tipsters&quot; &#8212; swarm around enterprises and ministries to find out what 
surpluses and deficits each has. They arrange trades between factories so 
desperate for needed goods that they are willing to pay any price.' (<i>N.Y. 
Times</i>, 11th June, 1950.)</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n13" href="#fn13">[13]</a> Ibid., p. 63. In 1940, Russian supply organizations numbered 
some 5,000 agencies, employing 126,000 workers and involving costs of service 
equal to 11 per cent. of turnover.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n18" href="#fn18">[18]</a> Peter Meyer, 'USSR: A New Class Society', <i>Politics</i>, 
March, 1944. Meyer establishes a table on the basis of Hubbard's data showing 
that if the cost of one week's food for 1913, 1929 and 1937 is taken at 3.40, 
5.90 and 49.60 rubles respectively (Hubbard's data is 3.42, 5.89 and 49.56 
rubles); and if industrial wages are taken at R25, R66 and R245 (Hubbard's data 
for the same period are R25, R77 and R245 &#8212; Meyer claims that Hubbard 'gives the 
monthly wages for 1929 as 77 rubles, but he has made an error, having taken the 
figure for 1930.'), the conclusions are quite obvious. The index of food prices 
will be 172 and 1,449 for 1929 and 1937, respectively (with 1913 taken as 100); 
and the index of real wages will be 154 and 68 for 1929 and 1937, respectively 
(with 1913 taken as 100). Mr. Hubbard's conclusions, however, are not too clear. 
He writes:</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%">'On an average, the 1937 prices of essential clothing and 
foodstuffs were at least five times the 1929 prices, while the average wage was 
only slightly more than three times the 1929 level. In other words, the 
purchasing power of the worker's income in 1937 was about 65 per cent. of 1929. 
The retail price index for all consumers' goods in 1929 was about 200 (1913, 
100) and the wage index about 308. This would seem to indicate that the 1929 
wage purchased about half as much again as in 1913; but as the 1937 wage had 
only about two-thirds of the purchasing power in 1929, it looks as though real 
wages in 1913 and 1937 were pretty well at the same level.' L. E. Hubbard, <i>
Soviet Labour and Industry</i>, MacMillan, London, p. 165, 1942.)</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n24" href="#fn24">[24]</a> The emphasis placed on the export of capital, in discussions 
around imperialism, has often been at the expense of other features of equal &#8212; 
and, under present circumstances, greater &#8212; importance; viz., industrial 
concentration, monopoly, the re-division of the world, etc.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n25" href="#fn25">[25]</a> The process, to be sure, is uneven and combined. Repressions

<p class="endnote"><a name="n30" href="#fn30">[30]</a> Slave labour was undoubtedly intended as a permanent feature 
of German fascism. It is not through regard for, but in disregard of, the 
interests of German capitalism that the 'surplus' population of East Germany is 
permitted to exist (at Allied sufferance) 'only' as ... a starving mass of 
refugees. The destruction of 4,000,000 Jews comprises no more than the form of 
selecting 4,000,000 human beings who had to perish under capitalism. The list 
was later to include: Gypsies, Poles, Russians, Ukrainians, etc.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n31" href="#fn31">[31]</a> These features, of course, extend to areas under Russian 
occupation. Mr. MacCormac of the <i>N.Y. Times</i> (19th June, 1950), for 
example, reports offhandedly:</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%">'Like Russia the satellites now are experimenting with prison 
labour as a solution to their difficulties. New legal codes are being adopted 
after the Soviet model to provide for the &quot;reform&quot; of certain classes of 
prisoners by sentencing them to labour for one month to two years at &quot;reduced 
wages&quot;.'</p>
