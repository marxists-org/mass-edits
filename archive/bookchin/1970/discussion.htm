<hr>

<p class="fst">Robert B. Carson, in an article published in the April 1970 issue 
of <i>Monthly Review</i>, writes that the "major thrust" of 'Listen, Marxist!' 
is to "destroy a class-based analysis of society and revolutionary activity." 
This criticism has been made by many Marxists who read the article.<a href="#r1" name="rn1" target="_self">[1*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Carson's accusation is quite absurd. I seriously doubt if he did 
more than skim the article. Carson goes on to say that my approach is 
"ahistorical" and that I try to promote a "crude kind of individualistic 
anarchism"&#8212;this despite the fact that a large portion of the article attempts to 
draw important historical lessons from earlier revolutions and despite the fact 
that the article is unequivocally committed to anarcho-communism.</p>

<p class="fst">The most interesting thing about Carson's criticism is what it 
reveals about the theoretical level of many Marxists. Apparently Carson regards 
a <i>futuristic</i> approach as "ahistorical." He also seems to regard my belief 
that freedom exists only when each individual controls his daily life as "a 
crude kind of individualistic anarchism." Here we get to the nub of the problem. 
Futurism and individual freedom are indeed the "main thrust" of the pamphlet. 
Carson's reply confirms <i>precisely</i> what the pamphlet set out to prove 
about Marxism today, namely that Marxism (I do not speak of Marx here) is <i>not</i> 
futuristic and that its perspectives are oriented not toward concrete, 
existential freedom, but toward an abstract freedom&#8212;freedom for "Society," for 
the "Proletariat," for <i>categories</i> rather than for people. Carson's first 
charge, I might emphasize, should be leveled not only at me but at Marx&#8212;at his 
futurism in the <i>Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">As to the charge that I am opposed to a "class-based analysis of 
society and revolutionary activity," need I say that a "class analysis" 
permeates the pamphlet? Is it conceivable that I could have terms like 
"capitalist" and "bourgeois" without working with a "class-based analysis"? 
Originally I thought there could have been no doubt about the matter. I have 
since changed the expression "class analysis" in the text to "class line," and 
perhaps I had better explain the difference this change is meant to convey.</p>

<p class="fst">What Carson is <i>really</i> saying is that I do not have a <i>
Marxist</i> "class analysis"&#8212;a "class analysis" in which the industrial 
proletariat is driven to revolution by destitution and immiseration. Carson 
apparently assumes that Marx's traditional "class <i>line</i>" exhausts all 
there is to say about the class struggle. And in this respect, he assumes far 
too much. One need only turn to Bakunin, for example, to find a class analysis 
that was quite different from Marx's&#8212;and more relevant today. Bakunin believed 
that the industrial proletariat by no means constitutes the most revolutionary 
class in society. He never received the credit due him for predicting the <i>
embourgeoisement</i> of the industrial working class with the development of 
capitalist industry. In Bakunin's view, the most revolutionary class was not the 
industrial proletariat&#8212;"a class always increasing in numbers, and disciplined, 
united, organized by the very mechanisms of capitalist production itself" 
(Marx)&#8212;but the uprooted peasantry and urban <i>declasses</i>, the rural and 
urban lumpen elements Marx so heartily despised. We need go no further than the 
urban centers of America&#8212;not to speak of the rice paddies of Asia&#8212;to find how 
accurate Bakunin was by comparison with Marx.</p>

<p class="fst">As it turned out, the development of capitalist industry not only 
"disciplined," "united" and "organized" the working class but, <i>by these very 
measures</i>, denatured the proletariat for generations. By contrast, the 
transitional and lumpenized classes of society today (such as blacks, dropout 
youth, people like students, intellectuals and artists who are not rooted in the 
factory system, and young workers whose allegiance to the work ethic has been 
shaken by cultural factors) are the most radical elements in the world today.</p>

<p class="fst">A "class analysis" does not necessarily begin and end with Marx's 
nineteenth-century version, a version I regard as grossly inaccurate. The class 
struggle, moreover, does not begin and end at the point of production. It may 
emerge from the poverty of the unemployed and unemployables, many of whom have 
never done a day's work in industry; it may emerge from a new sense of 
possibility that slowly pervades society&#8212;the tension between "what is" and "what 
could be"&#8212;which percolates through virtually all traditional classes; it may 
emerge from the cultural and physical decomposition of the traditional class 
structure on which the social stability of capitalism was based. Finally, every 
class struggle is not necessarily revolutionary. The class struggle between the 
original Roman <i>proletarius</i> and <i>patricius</i> was decidedly reactionary 
and eventually ended, as Marx observed in the opening lines of the <i>Communist 
Manifesto</i>, "in the common ruin of the contending classes."<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Today, not only poverty but also a relative degree of affluence 
is causing revolutionary unrest&#8212;a factor Marx never anticipated. Capitalism, 
having started out by proletarianizing the urban <i>declasses</i>, is now ending 
its life-cycle by creating new urban <i>declasses</i>, including "shiftless" 
young industrial workers who no longer take the jobs, the factory discipline or 
the work ethic seriously. This stratum of <i>declasses</i> rests on a new 
economic base&#8212;a post-scarcity technology, automation, a relative degree of 
material abundance&#8212;and it prefigures culturally the classless society the 
Marxists so devoutly envision as humanity's future. One would have thought that 
this remarkable dialectic, this "negation of the negation," would have stirred a 
flicker of understanding in the heavy thinkers of the Marxist movement.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>It would be difficult to conceive of a revolution in any 
industrially advanced capitalist country without the support of the industrial 
proletariat</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course. And "Listen, Marxist!" makes no claim that a social 
revolution is possible without the participation of the industrial proletariat. 
The article, in fact, tries to show how the proletariat can be won to the 
revolutionary movement by stressing issues that concern the quality of life and 
work. I agree, of course, with the libertarian Marxists and 
anarcho-syndicalists, who raise the slogan "workers' management of production." 
I wonder, however, if this slogan goes far enough now. My suspicion is that the 
workers, when they get into revolutionary motion, will demand even more than 
control of the factories. I think they will demand the elimination of toil, or, 
what amounts to the same thing, freedom from work. Certainly a dropout outlook 
is growing among kids from working-class families&#8212;high school kids who are being 
influenced by the youth culture.</p>

<p class="fst">Although many other factors may contribute to the situation, it 
remains true that the workers will develop revolutionary views to the degree 
that they shed their traditional working-class traits. Young workers, I think, 
will increasingly demand leisure and the abolition of alienated labor. The young 
Marx, I might add, was not indifferent to the development of unconventional 
values in the proletariat. In <i>The Holy Family</i>, he cites with obvious 
favor a Parisian working-class girl in Eugene Sue's <i>The Wandering Jew</i> who 
gives of her love and loyalty spontaneously, disdaining marriage and bourgeois 
conventions. He notes, "she constitutes a really human contrast to the 
hypocritical, narrow-hearted, self-seeking wife of the bourgeois, to the whole 
circle of the bourgeoisie, that is, to the official circle."<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> The working 
class, in the young Marx's view, is the negation of capitalism not only in that 
it suffers total alienation, abasement and dehumanization, but also in that it 
affirms life forces and human values. Unfortunately, observations of this kind 
tend to fade away as Marx's socialism becomes increasingly "objectivist" and 
"scientific" (the admirers of Marx's famous&#8212;but untranslated and little-read&#8212;<i>Grundrisse</i> 
notwithstanding). The later Marx begins to prize the bourgeois traits of the 
worker&#8212;the worker's "discipline," "practicality," and "realism"&#8212;as the 
characteristics necessary for a revolutionary class.</p>

<p class="fst">The approach which Marx followed in <i>The Holy Family</i> was, I 
think, the correct one. Trapped by the notion that the working class, <i>qua</i> 
class, implied the liquidation of class society, Marx failed to see that this 
class was the alter ego of the bourgeoisie. Only a new cultural movement could 
rework the outlook of the proletariat&#8212;and deproletarianize it. Ironically, the 
Parisian working-class girls of Marx's youth were not industrial workers, but 
rather people of transitional classes who straddled small- and large-scale 
production. They were largely lumpenized elements, like the <i>sans-culottes</i> 
of the French Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>If the analysis in</i> "<i>Listen, Marxist!</i>" <i>is</i> "<i>class-based</i>," <i>
what is the nature of the class struggle</i>?</p>

<p class="fst">The class struggle does not center around material exploitation 
alone but also around spiritual exploitation. In addition, entirely new issues 
emerge: coercive attitudes, the quality of work, ecology (or, stated in more 
general terms, psychological and environmental oppression). Moreover, the 
alienated and oppressed sectors of society are now the <i>majority of</i> the 
people, not a single class defined by its relationship to the means of 
production; the more radical as well as more liberatory sensibilities appear in 
the younger, not in the more "mature," age groups. Terms like "classes" and 
"class struggle," conceived of almost entirely as economic categories and 
relations, are too one-sided to express the <i>universalization</i> of the 
struggle. Use these limited expressions if you like (the target is still a 
ruling class and a class society), but this terminology, with its traditional 
connotations, does not reflect the sweep and the multi-dimensional nature of the 
struggle. Words like "class struggle" fail to encompass the cultural and 
spiritual revolt that is taking place along with the economic struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">"<i>Listen, Marxist!</i>" <i>speaks a great deal about the 
potentialities of a post-scarcity society</i>, <i>but what of the actualities</i>? <i>
There is still a great deal of poverty and hunger in the U.S. Inflation is a 
growing problem</i>, <i>not to speak of unemployment</i>, <i>bad housing</i>, <i>
racial discrimination</i>, <i>work speed-ups</i>, <i>trade union bureaucracy</i>, <i>
and the danger of fascism</i>, <i>imperialism and war</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">"Listen, Marxist!" was written to deal with the simplifications 
of social problems (the economic and Third World-oriented "either/or" notions) 
that were developing in the "New Left." The post-scarcity viewpoint advanced in 
the pamphlet was not designed to replace one simplification (class struggle) by 
another (utopia). Yes, these economic, racial and bureaucratic actualities exist 
for millions of people in the U.S. and abroad. Any revolutionary movement that 
fails to deal energetically and militantly with them will be as distorted as a 
movement that deals with them, singly or severally, to the exclusion of all 
others. My writings on post-scarcity possibilities, ecology, utopia, the youth 
culture and alienation are intended to help fill a major gap in radical theory 
and praxis, not to create another gap.</p>

<p class="fst">The really important problem we face is how the actualities of 
the present scarcity society are related to&#8212;and conditioned by&#8212;the 
potentialities for a future post-scarcity society. So far as this really 
dialectical problem is concerned, the heavy thinkers of the "left" show 
themselves to be incredibly light-minded and narrowly empirical. In the 
industrialized Western world, scarcity has to be enforced, so great is the 
productive potential of technology. Today economic planning has one basic 
purpose: to confine a highly advanced technology within a commodity framework. 
Many of the social problems which were endured almost passively a generation ago 
are now regarded as intolerable because the tension between "what is" and "what 
could be" has reached a point where "what is" seems utterly irrational. This 
tension adds an explosive character to many actualities that evoked only a 
flicker of protest a quarter of a century ago. Moreover, the tension between 
"what is" and "what could be" conditions all the traditional economic and social 
issues that have occupied radical movements for generations. We can no longer 
deal with these issues adequately unless we view them in the light of the 
economic, social and cultural possibilities of post-scarcity.</p>

<p class="fst">Let me present a concrete example. Assume there is a struggle by 
welfare mothers to increase their allotments. In the past, the mothers were 
organized by liberal groups or Stalinists; petitions were drawn up, 
demonstrations were organized, and <i>perhaps</i> a welfare center or two was 
occupied. Almost invariably, one of the groups or parties trotted out a "reform 
candidate" who promised that, if elected, he would fight "unflinchingly" for 
higher welfare expenditures. The entire struggle was contained within the 
organizational forms and institutions of the system: formal meetings of the 
mothers (with the patronizing "organizers" pulling the strings), formal modes of 
actions (petitions, demonstrations, elections for public office), and maybe a 
modest amount of direct action. The issue pretty much came to an end with a 
compromise on allotment increases and perhaps a lingering formal organization to 
oversee (and later sell out) future struggles around welfare issues.</p>

<p class="fst">Here actuality triumphed completely over potentiality. At best, a 
few mothers might be "radicalized," which meant that they joined (or were 
shamelessly used by) organizations such as the Communist Party to promote their 
political influence. For the rest, most of the welfare mothers returned to the 
shabbiness of their daily lives and to varying degrees of passivity as human 
beings. Nothing was really changed for those who did not ego trip as "leaders," 
"politicals" and "organizers."</p>

<p class="fst">To revolutionaries with a "post-scarcity consciousness" (to use 
Todd Gitlin's phrase), this kind of situation would be intolerable. Without 
losing sight of the concrete issues that initially motivated the struggle, 
revolutionaries would try to catalyze an order of relationships between the 
mothers entirely different from relationships the usual organizational format 
imposes. They would try to foster a deep sense of community, a rounded human 
relationship that would transform the very subjectivity of the people involved. 
Groups would be small, in order to achieve the full participation of everyone 
involved. Personal relationships would be intimate, not merely issue-oriented. 
People would get to <i>know</i> each other, to <i>confront</i> each other; they 
would <i>explore</i> each other with a view toward achieving the most complete, 
unalienated relationships. Women would discuss sexism as well as their welfare 
allotments, child-rearing as well as harassment by landlords, their dreams and 
hopes as human beings as well as the cost of living.</p>

<p class="fst">From this intimacy there would grow, hopefully, a supportive 
system of kinship, mutual aid, sympathy and solidarity in daily life. The women 
might collaborate to establish a rotating system of baby sitters and child-care 
attendants, the cooperative buying of good food at greatly reduced prices, the 
common cooking and partaking of meals, the mutual learning of survival skills 
and new social ideas, the fostering of creative talents, and many other shared 
experiences. Every aspect of life that could be explored and changed would be 
one part of the new kinds of relationships. This "extended family"&#8212;based on 
explored affinities and collective activities&#8212;would replace relationships 
mediated by "organizers," "chairmen," an "executive committee," <i>Robert's 
Rules of Order</i>, elites, and political manipulators.</p>

<p class="fst">The struggle for increased allotments would expand beyond the 
welfare system to the schools, the hospitals, the police, the physical, 
cultural, aesthetic and recreational resources of the neighborhood, the stores, 
the houses, the doctors and lawyers in the area, and so on&#8212;into the very ecology 
of the district.</p>

<p class="fst">What I have said on this issue could be applied to every 
issue&#8212;unemployment, bad housing, racism, work conditions&#8212;in which an insidious 
assimilation of bourgeois modes of functioning is masked as "realism" and 
"actuality." The new order of relationships that could be developed from a 
welfare struggle is Utopian only in the sense that actuality is informed and 
conditioned by post-scarcity consciousness. The future penetrates the present; 
it recasts the way people "organize" and the goals for which they strive.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Perhaps a post-scarcity perspective is possible in the U.S. 
and Europe</i>, <i>but it is hard to see how a post-scarcity</i> <i>approach has 
any relevance for the Third World</i>, <i>where technological development is 
grossly inadequate to meet the most elementary needs of the people</i>. <i>It 
would seem that the libertarian revolution and the non-coercive</i>, <i>
unmediated social forms that are possible for the U.S. and Europe would have to 
be supplanted by the rigorous planning of highly centralized</i>, <i>coercive 
institutions in Asia</i>, <i>Africa and Latin America</i>. <i>Carl Oglesby has 
even argued that to help these continents catch up with the U.S.</i>, <i>it will 
be necessary for Americans to work ten or twelve hours daily to produce the 
goods needed</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">I think we must dispel the confusion that exists about the Third 
World. This confusion, due partly to the superficiality of knowledge about the 
Third World, has done enormous harm to radical movements in the First World. 
"Third World" ideology in the U.S., by promoting a mindless imitation of 
movements in Asia and Latin America, leads to a bypassing of the social tasks in 
the First World. The result is that American radicals have often eased the tasks 
of American imperialism by creating an alien movement that does not speak to 
issues at home. The "Movement" (whatever <i>that</i> is) is isolated and the 
American people are fair game for every tendency, reactionary as well as 
liberal, that speaks to their problems.</p>

<p class="fst">I think we should begin with some essentials. The Third World is <i>
not</i> engaged in a "socialist revolution." One must be grossly ignorant of 
Marxism&#8212;the favored ideology of the Third World fetishists&#8212;in order to overlook 
the <i>real</i> nature of the struggle in Asia, Africa and Latin America. These 
areas are still taking up the tasks that capitalism resolved for the U.S. and 
Europe more than a century ago&#8212;national unification, national independence and 
industrial development. The Third World takes up these tasks in an era when 
state capitalism is becoming predominant in the U.S. and Europe, with the result 
that its own social forces have a highly statified character. Socialism and 
advanced forms of state capitalism are not easy to distinguish from each other, 
especially if one's conception of "socialism" is highly schematic. Drape 
hierarchy with a red flag, submerge the crudest system of primitive accumulation 
and forced collectivization in rhetoric about the interests of "the People" or 
"the "Proletariat," cover up hierarchy, elitism and a police state with huge 
portraits of Marx, Engels and Lenin, print little "Red Books" that invite the 
most authoritarian adulation and preach the most inane banalities in the name of 
"dialectics" and "socialism"&#8212;and any gullible liberal who is becoming 
disenchanted with his ideology, yet is totally unconscious of the bourgeois 
conditioning he has acquired from the patriarchal family and authoritarian 
school, can suddenly become a flaming "revolutionary" socialist.</p>

<p class="fst">The whole process is disgusting&#8212;all the more so because it stands 
at odds with every aspect of reality. One is tempted to scream: "Look, 
motherfucker! Help the Third World by fighting capitalism at home! Don't cop out 
by hiding under Ho's and Mao's skirts when your real job is to overthrow 
domestic capitalism by dealing with the real possibilities of an American 
revolution! Develop a revolutionary project at home because every revolutionary 
project here is <i>necessarily</i> internationalist and anti-imperialist, no 
matter how much its goals and language are limited to the American condition." 
Oglesby's hostility to a post-scarcity approach on the grounds that we will have 
to work ten or twelve hours daily to meet the Third World's needs is simply 
preposterous. To assume that the working day will be increased by an American 
revolution is to invite its defeat before the first blow is struck. If, in some 
miraculous way, Oglesby's "revolution" were to be victorious, surely he doesn't 
think that the American people would accept an increased working day without a 
strong, centralized state apparatus cracking its whip over the entire 
population. In which case, one wonders what kind of "aid" such a regime would 
"offer" to the Third World?</p>

<p class="fst">Like many of the "Third World" zealots, Oglesby seems to have an 
incomplete knowledge of America's industrial capacity and the real needs of the 
Third World. Roughly seventy percent of the American labor force does absolutely 
no productive work that could be translated into terms of real output or the 
maintenance of a rational system of distribution. Their work is largely limited 
to servicing the commodity economy&#8212;filing, billing, bookkeeping for a profit and 
loss statement, sales promotion, advertising, retailing, finance, the stock 
market, government work, military work, police work, etc., <i>ad nauseam</i>. 
Roughly the same percentage of the goods produced is such pure garbage that 
people would voluntarily stop consuming it in a rational society. Working hours 
could be reduced enormously after a revolution without losing high productive 
output, provided that the available labor supply and raw materials were used 
rationally. The quality of the productive output, moreover, could be so improved 
that its durability and usefulness would more than cancel out any reduction in 
productive capacity.</p>

<p class="fst">On the other side, let us look more closely at the material needs 
of the Third World. As Westerners, "we" tend to assume out of hand that "they" 
want or need the same kind of technologies and commodities that capitalism 
produced in America and Europe. This crude assumption is bolstered by the fear 
consciously generated by imperialist ideology, that millions of black, brown, 
and yellow people are hungrily eyeing "our" vast resources and standard of 
living. This ideology reminds us how lucky "we" are to be Americans or 
Europeans, enjoying the blessings of "free enterprise," and how menacing "they" 
are, festering in poverty, misery and the ills of overpopulation. Ironically, 
the "Third World" zealots share this ideology in the sense that they, too, 
conceive of Asian, African and Latin American needs in Western terms&#8212;an approach 
that might be called the Nkrumah mentality of technological gigantism. Whatever 
is living and vital in the pre-capitalist society of the Third World is 
sacrificed to industrial <i>machismo</i>, oozing with the egomaniacal elitism of 
the newly converted male radical.</p>

<p class="fst">Perhaps no area of the world is more suitable for an 
eco-technology than the Third World.<a href="#r2" name="rn2" target="_self">[2*]</a> Most of Asia, Africa and Latin America 
lie in the "solar belt," between latitudes 40 degrees north and south, where 
solar energy can be used with the greatest effectiveness for industrial and 
domestic purposes. New, small-scale technologies are more easily adapted for use 
in the underdeveloped areas than elsewhere. The small-scale gardening 
technologies, in fact, are indispensable for the productive use of the soil 
types that are prevalent in semi-tropical, tropical, and highland biomes. The 
peasantry in these areas have a long tradition of technological know-how in 
terracing and horticulture, for which small machines are already available or 
easily designable. Great strides have been made in developing an irrigation 
technology to provide year-round water resources for agriculture and industry. A 
unique combination could be made of machine and handcrafts, crafts in which 
these areas still excel. With advances in the standard of living and in 
education, the population of these areas could be expected to stabilize 
sufficiently to remove pressure on the land. What the Third World needs above 
all is a rational, sophisticated communications network to redistribute food and 
manufactures from areas of plentiful supply to those in need.</p>

<p class="fst">A technology of this kind could be developed for the Third World 
fairly rapidly by American and European industry without placing undue strain on 
the resources of the West. The rational use of such a technology presupposes a 
sweeping social revolution in the Third World itself&#8212;a revolution, I believe, 
that would almost immediately follow a social revolution in the U.S. With the 
removal of imperialism's mailed fist, a new perspective could open for the Third 
World. The village would acquire a new sense of unity with the elimination of 
the local hierarchies appointed by the central governments which have so heavily 
parasitized the regions. An exchange economy would continue to exist in the 
Third World, although its base would probably be collectivist. In any case, the 
exploitation of labor and the domination of women by men would be eliminated, 
thus imposing severe restrictions on the use of income differentials for 
exploitative purposes.<a href="#r3" name="rn3" target="_self">[3*]</a> The resources of the First World could be used to 
promote the most revolutionary social alternatives&#8212;a people's movement as 
against an authoritarian one, decentralized, immediate relations as against 
centralized mediated institutions.</p>

<p class="fst">It would be difficult to say what kind of institutional structure 
would emerge from revolutionary changes in the Third World following a complete 
social revolution in the First World. Until now, the Third World has been 
obliged to fight imperialism largely on its own. Although there has been a great 
deal of international solidarity from millions of people in Europe and the U.S. 
for Third World struggles, there has been no real, disinterested material 
support from these key industrial areas. One wonders what will happen when a 
revolutionary United States and Europe begin to aid the Third World fully and 
disinterestedly, with nothing but the well being of the African, Asian and Latin 
American peoples at issue. I believe that the social development in the Third 
World will take a more benign and libertarian form than we suspect; and that 
surprisingly little coercion will be needed to deal with material scarcity in 
these areas.</p>

<p class="fst">In any case, there is no reason to fear that a quasi-statist 
development in the Third World would be more than temporary or that it would 
affect the world development. If the U.S. and Europe took a libertarian 
direction, their strategic industrial position in the world economy would, I 
think, favor a libertarian alternative for the world as a whole. Revolution is 
contagious, even when it occurs in a relatively small and economically 
insignificant country. I cannot imagine that Eastern Europe could withstand the 
effects of a libertarian revolution in Western Europe and the U.S. The 
revolution would almost certainly engulf the Soviet Union, where massive 
dissatisfaction exists, and finally the entire Asian continent. If one doubts 
the fulfillment of this possibility, let him consider the impact of the French 
Revolution on Europe at a time when the world economy was far less 
interdependent than it is today.</p>

<p class="fst">After the revolution the planet would be dealt with as a whole. 
The relocation of populations in areas of high density, the development of 
rational, humanistic birth control programs oriented toward improving the 
quality of life, and the modification of technology along ecological lines&#8212;all 
of these programs would be on the agenda of history. Aside from suggesting some 
basic guidelines drawn from ecology, I can do no more than speculate about how 
the resources and land areas of the world could be used to improve life in a 
post-revolutionary period. These programs will be solved in practice and by 
human communities that stand on a far higher level, culturally, psychologically 
and materially, than any community that exists today.</p>

<p class="fst">"<i>Listen, Marxist!</i>" <i>seems to be quite relevant as a 
critique of the vulgar Marxists&#8212;Progressive Labor</i>, <i>the Trotskyists</i>, <i>
and other</i> "<i>Old Left</i>" <i>movements</i>. <i>But what of the more 
sophisticated Marxists&#8212;people such as Marcuse</i>, <i>Gorz and the admirers of 
Gramsci</i>? <i>Surely</i> "<i>Listen, Marxist!</i>" <i>imputes too much to the</i> 
"<i>Old Left</i>" <i>in taking it as the point of departure for a critique of 
Marxism</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Marcuse is the most original of the thinkers who still call 
themselves Marxists, and I must confess that even on those points where I may 
have disagreements with him, I am stimulated by what he has to say.</p>

<p class="fst">With this exception, I would differ with the claim that "Listen, 
Marxist!" is relevant only as a critique of the "Old Left." The article is 
relevant to all types of Marxist ideology. Two things trouble me about Marx's 
mature writings: their pseudo-objectivity and the obstacles they raise to 
Utopian thinking. The Marxian project, as it was formulated by Marx himself, 
deepened the early socialist tradition but also narrowed it, and in the long run 
this has produced a net setback rather than a net gain.</p>

<p class="fst">By Marx's pseudo-objectivity I mean the astonishing extent to 
which Marx identified "scientific socialism" with the scientism of the 
nineteenth century. Although there is a tendency today for the more 
sophisticated "neo-Marxists" to cast the Marxian project in terms of alienation, 
the project (as it developed in Marx's hands) was above all an attempt to make 
socialism "scientific," to provide it with the authority of a scientific 
critique. This led to an emphasis on "objectivity" that increasingly subverted 
the humanistic goals of socialism. Freedom and Eros (where the latter was taken 
up at all) were anchored so completely in the material preconditions for freedom 
that even the loss of freedom, if it promoted the material development, was 
viewed as an "advance" of freedom. Marx, for example, welcomed state 
centralization as a step in the development of the productive forces without 
once considering how this process enhanced the capacity of the bourgeoisie to 
resist revolution. He disclaimed any moral evaluation of society and in his 
later years became increasingly captive to scientism and to mathematical 
criteria of truth.</p>

<p class="fst">The result of this development has been a major loss for the 
humanistic and imaginative elements of socialism. Marxism has damaged the left 
enormously by anchoring it in a pseudo-objectivity that is almost 
indistinguishable from the juridical mentality. Whenever I hear "New Left" 
Marxists denounce a position as "objectively counter-revolutionary," 
"objectively racist," or "objectively sexist," my flesh crawls. The charge, 
flung randomly against all opponents, circumvents the need for an analytic or a 
dialectical critique. One simply traces "counterrevolution," "racism" or 
"sexism" to be the preconceived "objective effects." Marx rarely exhibited the 
crudity of the "Old Left" and "New Left" in his use of this approach, but he 
used the approach often enough&#8212;and often as a substitute for a multidimensional 
analysis of phenomena.</p>

<p class="fst">You must see how consequential this is. Freedom is divested of 
its autonomy, of its sovereignty over the human condition. It is turned into a 
means instead of an end. Whether freedom is desirable or not depends upon 
whether it furthers the "objective" development. Accordingly, any authoritarian 
organization, any system of repression, any manipulatory tactic can become 
acceptable, indeed admirable, if it favors the "building of socialism" or 
"resistance to imperialism"&#8212;as though "socialism" or "anti-imperialism" is 
meaningful when it is poisoned by manipulation, repression, and authoritarian 
forms of organization. Categories replace realities; abstract goals replace real 
goals; "History" replaces everyday life. The universal, which requires a 
complex, many-sided analysis to be grasped, is replaced by the particular; the 
total, by the one-sided.</p>

<p class="fst">No less serious is the rejection of Utopian thought&#8212;the 
imaginative forays of Charles Fourier and William Morris. What Martin Buber 
called the "utopian element in socialism" is rejected for a "hardheaded" and 
"objective" treatment of "reality." But, in fact, this approach shrivels reality 
by limiting one's purview of social experience and data. The hidden potential of 
a given reality is either subverted by an emphasis on the "objective" 
actualities or, at least, diminished by a one-sided treatment. The revolutionary 
becomes a captive to experience not as it exists dialectically, in <i>all</i> 
its actualities and potentialities, but as it is defined in advance by 
"scientific socialism." Not surprisingly, the New Left, like the Old Left, has 
never grasped the revolutionary potential of the ecology issue, nor has it used 
ecology as a basis for understanding the problems of communist reconstruction 
and Utopia. At best the issue is given lip service, with some drivel about how 
"pollution is profitable"; at worst it is denounced as spurious, diversionary 
and "objectively counterrevolutionary." Most of the sophisticated Marxists are 
as captive to these limiting features of Marxism as their New Left brethren. The 
difference is that they are simply more sophisticated.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>In contrast to most radical works</i>, "<i>Listen, Marxist!</i>" <i>
continually speaks of</i> "<i>hierarchical society</i>" <i>instead of</i> "<i>class 
society</i>," <i>of</i> "<i>domination</i>" <i>instead of</i> "<i>exploitation</i>." <i>
What significance do these differences in language have</i>?</p>

<p class="fst">A difference is definitely intended. Pre-Marxian socialism was, 
in many ways, much broader than the Marxian variety. Not only was it more 
utopian, it was also occupied more with the general than the particular. Varlet, 
the last of the great <i>enrages</i>, who survived the death of his comrade 
Jacques Roux and Robespierre's purge of the left, concluded that government and 
revolution are utterly "incompatible." What a splendid insight! In this one 
observation revolutionary consciousness expanded from a critique of a specific 
class society to a critique of hierarchical society as such. The pre-Marxian 
socialist and radical theorists began to occupy themselves with domination, not 
only exploitation; with hierarchy, not only class rule. With Fourier, 
consciousness advanced to the point where the goal of society was viewed as 
pleasure, not simply happiness.</p>

<p class="fst">You must see what an enormous gain this was. Exploitation, class 
rule and happiness are the <i>particular</i> within the more <i>generalized</i> 
concepts of domination, hierarchy and pleasure. It is theoretically&#8212;and, in 
great part, actually-possible to eliminate exploitation and class rule or to 
achieve happiness, as these concepts are defined by Marxism, without achieving a 
life of pleasure or eliminating domination and hierarchy. Marx, by 
"scientifically" anchoring exploitation, classes, and happiness in the economic 
domain, actually provided the rationale for a theoretical regression from the 
original socialist values. Marxian economic solutions, such as nationalization 
of property, may even create the illusion that hierarchy has disappeared. One 
has only to study the torment of the Trotskyist movement over the nature of the 
Russian state to see how obfuscating Marxian theory can be.</p>

<p class="fst">This particularization of the general is precisely what Marxism 
achieved. As I noted in reply to the previous question, socialism was given 
greater theoretical depth by the acquisition of dialectical philosophy, but it 
was narrowed disastrously by Marx's economic emphasis. Even Marx's writings 
shrivel in content as the man "matures." They increasingly center on the 
"objective" economic elements of society, until Marx sinks into a grotesque 
fetishization of economic theory of the kind we find in volume two of <i>Capital</i>. 
With Marx's death, an immense exegetical literature emerges on capitalist 
circulation, accumulation and "realization theory." Even Rosa Luxemburg was 
caught in this swamp, not to speak of the Keynesian Marxists who churn out their 
papers for the <i>American Economic Review</i> and <i>Science and Society</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Marxism created a stupendous intellectual furniture that one must 
clear away to make contact with reality. The field abounds with "experts" and 
heavies, with academics and authorities whose bullshit makes original, indeed 
dialectical, thought virtually impossible. Once we rescue the essentials, this 
theoretical garbage must be junked. It is vitally necessary that we return to 
the generalized terrain that pre-Marxian socialism established, and then go 
forward again.</p>

<p class="fst">The youth culture has already posed the "social question" in its 
richest and most meaningful terms&#8212;"Life versus death." I would say, with an eye 
towards the insights of Marxism, "Life versus survival." In any case, we have to 
get away from the one-sided, repressive jargon of Marxism, which defines our 
perspective in a limiting manner. I am reminded of a fine passage from Paul 
Avrich's recent book, <i>Kronstadt 1921</i>, in which the language of the 
revolutionary Kronstadt sailors is contrasted with that of the Bolsheviks. 
"Rebel agitators," Avrich notes, speaking of the sailors, "wrote and spoke (as 
an interviewer later noted) in a homespun language free of Marxist jargon and 
foreign-sounding expressions. Eschewing the word 'proletariat,' they called, in 
true populist fashion, for a society in which all the 'toilers'&#8212;peasants, 
workers and the 'toiling intelligentsia'&#8212;would play a dominant role. They were 
inclined to speak of a 'social' rather than a 'socialist' revolution, viewing 
class conflict not in the narrow sense of industrial workers versus bourgeoisie, 
but in the traditional <i>narodnik</i> sense of the laboring masses as a whole 
pitted against all who throve on their misery and exploitation, including 
politicians and bureaucrats as well as landlords and capitalists. Western 
ideologies&#8212;Marxism and liberalism alike&#8212;had little place in their mental 
outlook."<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The point, of course, is not Western ideologies versus Russian, 
or "homespun" versus "foreign-sounding" language. The real point is the <i>
broader</i> concepts with which the "masses" worked almost intuitively&#8212;concepts 
drawn from the experience of their own oppression. Note how the sailors had a 
broader view of the "laboring masses" and their "oppressors" than the 
Bolsheviks, a view that included the elitist Bolsheviks among the oppressors. 
Note well, too, how Marxist jargon made it possible for the Bolsheviks to 
exclude themselves as oppressors in flat denial of the real situation. For my 
part, I am delighted that the New Left in America has replaced the words 
"workers and "proletariat" by "people." Indeed, it is significant that even 
professedly Marxian groups like the Panthers and Weathermen have been obliged to 
use a populist language, for this language reflects the changed reality and 
problems of our times.</p>

<p class="fst">To sum up: what I am talking about is a human condition reflected 
by the word "power." We must finally resolve the historic and everyday 
dichotomies: man's power over woman, man's power over man, and man's power over 
nature. For inherent in the issue of power&#8212;of domination&#8212;are the contradictory, 
destructive effects of power: the corruption of life-giving sexuality, of a 
life-nourishing society, of a life-orienting ego, and of a life-sustaining 
ecology. The statement "power corrupts" is not a truism because it has never 
been fully understood. It may yet become understood because power now <i>
destroys</i>. No amount of theoretical exegesis can place power in the service 
of history or of a revolutionary organization. The only act of power that is 
excusable any longer is that one act&#8212;<i>popular</i> revolution&#8212;that will finally 
dissolve power as such by giving each individual power over his or her everyday 
life.</p>

<h3>Footnotes:</h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="r1" href="#rn1">[1*]</a> This is an edited summary of several discussions on "<a href="../1969/listen-marxist.htm">Listen, 
Marxist!</a>," most of which occurred at my anarcho-communism class at Alternate U, 
New York's liberation school. I have selected the most representative and 
recurrent questions raised by readers of the pamphlet.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r2" href="#rn2">[2*]</a> The alternatives to a "Western"-type technology for the Third 
World and the resolution of the "population problem" in this area will be 
discussed in some detail in my forthcoming book, <i>The Ecology of Freedom</i>, 
to be published by Alfred A. Knopf and as a Vintage paperback.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r3" href="#rn3">[3*]</a> More can be learned, I think, from the impact the Spanish 
anarchist movement had on the village economy than from Mao or Ho and the 
movements they spoke for. Unfortunately, very little information on this 
development is available in English. The spontaneous takeover and 
collectivization of the land by Spanish <i>pueblos</i> during the early weeks of 
Franco's rebellion provides us with one of the most remarkable accounts of how 
the peasantry can respond to libertarian influence.</p>
