<hr>

<p class="fst">In the morning hours of July 18, 1936, General Francisco Franco 
issued the <i>pronunciamiento</i> from Las Palmas in Spanish North Africa that 
openly launched the struggle of Spain's reactionary military officers against 
the legally elected Popular Front government in Madrid.</p>

<p class="fst">The Franco <i>pronunciamiento</i> left little doubt that, in the 
event of victory by the Spanish generals, the parliamentary republic would be 
replaced by a clearly authoritarian state, modeled institutionally on similar 
regimes in Germany and Italy. The Francoist forces or "Nationalists," as they 
were to call themselves, exhibited all the trappings and ideologies of the 
fascist movements of the day: the raised open-palm salute, the appeals to a 
"folk-soil" philosophy of order, duty, and obedience, and the avowed commitments 
to smash the labor movement and end all political dissidence. To the world, the 
conflict initiated by the Spanish generals seemed like another of the classic 
struggles waged between the "forces of fascism" and the "forces of democracy" 
that reached such acute proportions in the thirties. What distinguished the 
Spanish conflict from similar struggles in Italy, Germany, and Austria, however, 
was the massive resistance with which the "forces of democracy" seemed to oppose 
to the Spanish military. Franco and his military co-conspirators, despite the 
wide support they enjoyed among the officer cadres in the army, grossly 
miscalculated the popular opposition they would encounter. The so-called 
"Spanish Civil War" lasted nearly three years&#8212;from July 1936 to March 1939&#8212;and 
claimed an estimated million lives.</p>

<p class="fst">For the first time, so it seemed to many of us in the thirties, 
an entire people with dazzling courage had arrested the terrifying success of 
fascist movements in central and southern Europe. Scarcely three years earlier, 
Hitler had pocketed Germany without a shred of resistance from the massive 
Marxist-dominated German labor movement. Austria, two years before, had 
succumbed to an essentially authoritarian state after a week of futile 
street-fighting by Socialist workers in Vienna. Everywhere fascism seemed "on 
the march" and "democracy" in retreat. But Spain had seriously resisted&#8212;and 
continued to resist for years despite the armaments, aircraft, and troops which 
Franco acquired from Italy and Germany. To radicals and liberals alike, the 
Spanish Civil War was being waged not only on the Iberian Peninsula but in every 
country where "democracy" seemed threatened by the rising tide of domestic and 
international fascist movements. The Spanish Civil War, we were led to believe, 
was a struggle between a liberal republic that was valiantly and with popular 
support trying to defend a democratic parliamentary state against authoritarian 
generals&#8212;an imagery that is conveyed to this very day by most books on the 
subject and by that shabby cinematic documentary <i>To Die in Madrid</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">What so few of us knew outside Spain, however, was that the 
Spanish Civil War was in fact a sweeping social revolution by millions of 
workers and peasants who were concerned not to rescue a treacherous republican 
regime but to reconstruct Spanish society along revolutionary lines. We would 
scarcely have learned from the press that these workers and peasants viewed the 
Republic almost with as much animosity as they did the Francoists. Indeed, 
acting largely on their own initiative against "republican" ministers who were 
trying to betray them to the generals, they had raided arsenals and 
sporting-goods stores for weapons and with incredible valor had aborted military 
conspiracies in most of the cities and towns of Spain. We were almost totally 
oblivious to the fact that these workers and peasants had seized and 
collectivized most of the factories and land in republican-held areas, 
establishing a new social order based on direct control of the country's 
productive resources by workers' committees and peasant assemblies. While the 
republic's institutions lay in debris, abandoned by most of its military and 
police forces, the workers and peasants had created their own institutions to 
administer the cities in Republican Spain, formed their own armed workers' 
squads to patrol the streets, and established a remarkable revolutionary militia 
force with which to fight the Francoist forces&#8212;a voluntaristic militia in which 
men and women elected their own commanders and in which military rank conferred 
no social, material, or symbolic distinctions. Largely unknown to us at that 
time, the Spanish workers and peasants had made a sweeping social revolution. 
They had created their own revolutionary social forms to administer the country 
as well as to wage war against a well-trained and well-supplied army. The 
"Spanish Civil War" was not a political conflict between a liberal democracy and 
a fascist military corps but a deeply socio-economic conflict between the 
workers and peasants of Spain and their historic class enemies, ranging from the 
landowning grandees and clerical overlords inherited from the past to the rising 
industrial bourgeoisie and bankers of more recent times.</p>

<p class="fst">The revolutionary scope of this conflict was concealed from us&#8212;by 
"us" I refer to the many thousands of largely Communist-influenced radicals of 
the "red" thirties who responded to the struggle in Spain with the same fervor 
and agony that young people of the sixties responded to the struggle in 
Indochina. We need not turn to Orwell or Borkenau, radicals of obviously strong 
anti-Stalinist convictions, for an explanation of this fervor. Burnett Bolloten, 
a rather politically innocent United Press reporter who happened to be stationed 
in Madrid at the time, conveys his own sense of moral outrage at the 
misrepresentation of the Spanish conflict in the opening lines of his superbly 
documented study, <i>The Grand Camouflage</i>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Although the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July, 1936, was 
followed by a far-reaching social-revolution in the anti-Franco camp&#8212;more 
profound in some respects than the Bolshevik Revolution in its early 
stages&#8212;millions of discerning people outside of Spain were kept in ignorance, 
not only of its depth and range, but even of its existence, by virtue of a 
policy of duplicity and dissimulation of which there is no parallel in history.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Foremost in practicing this deception upon the world, and in 
misrepresenting in Spain itself the character of the revolution, were the 
Communists, who, although but an exiguous minority when the Civil War began, 
used so effectually the manifold opportunities which that very upheaval 
presented that before the close of the conflict in 1939 they became, behind a 
democratic frontispiece, the ruling force in the left camp."</p>

<p class="fst">The details of this deception could fill several large volumes. 
The silence that gathers around Spain, like a bad conscience, attests to the 
fact that the events are very much alive&#8212;as are the efforts to misrepresent 
them. After nearly forty years the wounds have not healed. In fact, as the 
recent revival of Stalinism suggests, the disease that produced the purulence of 
counterrevolution in Spain still lingers on in the American left. But to deal 
with the Stalinist counterrevolution in Spain is beyond the scope of these 
remarks. It might be useful, however, to examine the revolutionary tendencies 
that unfolded prior to July 1936 and explore the influence they exercised on the 
Spanish working class and peasantry. Their collectives were not the results of 
virginal popular spontaneity, important as popular spontaneity was, nor were 
they nourished exclusively by the collectivist legacy of traditional Spanish 
village society. Revolutionary ideas and movements played a crucial role of 
their own and their influence deserves the closest examination.</p>

<p class="fst">The Spanish generals started a military rebellion in July 1936; 
the Spanish workers and peasants answered them with a social revolution&#8212;and this 
revolution was largely anarchist in character. I say this provocatively even 
though the Socialist UGT was numerically as large as the anarchosyndicalist CNT.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
During the first few months of the military rebellion, Socialist workers in 
Madrid often acted as radically as anarchosyndicalist workers in Barcelona. They 
established their own militias, formed street patrols, and expropriated a number 
of strategic factories, placing them under the control of workers' committees. 
Similarly, Socialist peasants in Castile and Estramadura formed collectives, 
many of which were as libertarian as those created by anarchist peasants in 
Aragon and the Levant. In the opening "anarchic" phase of the revolution, so 
similar to the opening phases of earlier revolutions, the "masses" tried to 
assume direct control over society and exhibited a remarkable élan in 
improvising their own libertarian forms of social administration.</p>

<p class="fst">Looking back beyond this opening phase, however, it is fair to 
say that the durability of the collectives in Spain, their social scope, and the 
resistance they offered to the Stalinist counterrevolution, depended largely on 
the extent to which they were under anarchist influence. What distinguishes the 
Spanish Revolution from those which preceded it is not only the fact that it 
placed much of Spain's economy in the hands of workers' committees and peasant 
assemblies or that it established a democratically elected militia system. These 
social forms, in varying degrees, had emerged during the Paris Commune and in 
the early period of the Russian Revolution. What made the Spanish Revolution 
unique was its workers' control and collectives which had been advocated for 
nearly three generations by a massive libertarian movement and which became one 
of the most serious issues to divide the so-called "republican" camp (together 
with the fate of the militia system). Owing to the scope of its libertarian 
social forms, not only did the Spanish Revolution prove to be "more profound" 
(to borrow Bolloten's phrase) than the Bolshevik Revolution, but the influence 
of a deeply rooted anarchist ideology and the intrepidity of anarchist militants 
virtually produced a civil war within the civil war.</p>

<p class="fst">Indeed, in many respects, the revolution of 1936 marked the 
culmination of more than sixty years of anarchist agitation and activity in 
Spain. To understand this, we must go back to the early 1870s, when the Italian 
anarchist Giuseppi Fanelli introduced Bakunin's ideas to groups of workers and 
intellectuals in Madrid and Barcelona. Fanelli's encounter with young workers of 
the <i>Fomento de las Artes</i> in Madrid, a story told with great relish by 
Gerald Brenan is almost legendary: the volatile speech that the tall bearded 
Italian anarchist who hardly knew a word of Spanish delivered to a small but 
enthusiastic audience that scarcely understood his free-wheeling mixture of 
French and Italian. By dint of sheer mimicry, tonal inflections, and a generous 
use of cognates, Fanelli managed to convey enough of Bakunin's ideals to gain 
the group's adherence and to establish the founding Spanish section of the 
International Working Men's Association or so-called "First International." 
Thereafter, the "Internationalists," as the early Spanish anarchists were known, 
expanded rapidly from their circles in Madrid and Barcelona to Spain as a whole, 
taking strong root especially in Catalonia and Andalusia. Following the 
definitive split between the Marxists and Bakuninists at the Hague Congress of 
the IWMA in September 1872, the Spanish section remained predominantly 
Bakuninist in its general outlook. Marxism did not become a significant movement 
in Spain until the turn of the century, and even after it became an appreciable 
force in the labor movement, it remained largely reformist until well into the 
thirties. During much of its early history, the strength of the Spanish 
Socialist Party and the UGT lay in administrative areas such as Madrid rather 
than in predominantly working-class cities like Barcelona.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> 
Marxism tended to appeal to the highly skilled, pragmatic, rather authoritarian 
Castilian; anarchism, to the unskilled, idealistic Catalans and the independent, 
liberty-loving mountain villagers of Andalusia and the Levant. The great rural 
masses of Andalusian day-workers or <i>braceros</i>, who remain to this day 
among the most oppressed and impoverished strata of European society, tended to 
follow the anarchists. But their allegiances varied with the fortunes of the 
day. In periods of upheaval, they swelled the ranks of the Bakuninist IWMA and 
its successor organizations in Spain, only to leave it in equally large numbers 
in periods of reaction.</p>

<p class="fst">Yet however much the fortunes of Spanish anarchism varied from 
region to region and from period to period, whatever revolutionary movement 
existed in Spain during this sixty-year period was essentially anarchist. Even 
as anarchism began to ebb before Marxian social-democratic and later Bolshevik 
organizations after the First World War, Spanish anarchism retained its enormous 
influence and its revolutionary élan. Viewed from a radical standpoint, the 
history of the Spanish labor movement remained libertarian and often served to 
define the contours of the Marxist movements in Spain. "Generally speaking, a 
small but well-organized group of Anarchists in a Socialist area drove the 
Socialists to the Left," observes Brenan, "whereas in predominantly Anarchist 
areas, Socialists were outstandingly reformist." It was not socialism but rather 
anarchism that determined the metabolism of the Spanish labor movement&#8212;the great 
general strikes that swept repeatedly over Spain, the recurring insurrections in 
Barcelona and in the towns and villages of Andalusia, and the gun battles 
between labor militants and employer-hired thugs in the Mediterranean coastal 
cities.</p>

<p class="fst">It is essential to emphasize that Spanish anarchism was not 
merely a program embedded in a dense theoretical matrix. It was a way of life: 
partly the life of the Spanish people as it was lived in the closely knit 
villages of the countryside and the intense neighborhood life of the working 
class barrios; partly, too, the theoretical articulation of that life as 
projected by Bakunin's concepts of decentralization, mutual aid, and popular 
organs of self-management. That Spain had a long tradition of agrarian 
collectivism is discussed in this book and examined in some detail in Joaquin 
Costa's <i>Colectivismo Agrario en Espagna</i>. Inasmuch as this tradition was 
distinctly precapitalist, Spanish Marxism regarded it as anachronistic, in fact 
as "historically reactionary." Spanish socialism built its agrarian program 
around the Marxist tenet that the peasantry and its social forms could have no 
lasting revolutionary value until they were "proletarianized" and 
"industrialized." Indeed, the sooner the village decayed the better, and the 
more rapidly the peasantry became a hereditary proletariat, "disciplined, 
united, organized by the very mechanism of the process of capitalist production 
itself" (Marx)&#8212;a distinctly hierarchical and authoritarian "mechanism"&#8212;the more 
rapidly Spain would advance to the tasks of socialism.</p>

<p class="fst">Spanish anarchism, by contrast, followed a decisively different 
approach. It sought out the precapitalist collectivist traditions of the 
village, nourished what was living and vital in them, evoked their revolutionary 
potentialities as liberatory modes of mutual aid and self-management, and 
deployed them to vitiate the obedience, hierarchical mentality, and 
authoritarian outlook fostered by the factory system. Ever mindful of the 
"embourgeoisment" of the proletariat (a term continually on Bakunin's lips in 
the later years of his life), the Spanish anarchists tried to use the 
precapitalist traditions of the a peasantry and working class against the 
assimilation of the workers' outlook to an authoritarian industrial rationality. 
In this respect, their efforts were favored by the continuous fertilization of 
the Spanish proletariat by rural workers who renewed these traditions daily as 
they migrated to the cities. The revolutionary élan of the Barcelona 
proletariat&#8212;like that of the Petrograd and Parisian proletariats&#8212;was due in no 
small measure to the fact that these workers never solidly sedimented into a 
hereditary working class, totally removed from precapitalist traditions, whether 
of the peasant or the craftsman. Along the Mediterranean coastal cities of 
Spain, many workers retained a living memory of a noncapitalist culture&#8212;one in 
which each moment of life was not strictly regulated by the punch clock, the 
factory whistle, the foreman, the machine, the highly regulated work day, and 
the atomizing world of the large city. Spanish anarchism flourished within a 
tension created by these antagonistic traditions and sensibilities. Indeed, 
where a "Germanic proletariat" (to use another of Bakunin's cutting phrases) 
emerged in Spain, it drifted either toward the UGT or toward the Catholic 
unions. Its political outlook, reformist when not overtly conservative, often 
clashed with the more <i>déclassé</i> working class of Catalonia and the 
Mediterranean coast, leading to conflicting tendencies within the Spanish 
proletariat as a whole.</p>

<p class="fst">Ultimately, in my view, the destiny of Spanish anarchism depended 
upon its ability to create libertarian organizational forms that could 
synthesize as the precapitalist collectivist traditions of the village with an 
industrial economy and a highly urbanized society. I speak here of no mere 
programmatic "alliance" between the Spanish peasantry and proletariat but more 
organically, of new organizational forms and sensibilities that imparted a 
revolutionary libertarian character to two social classes who lived in 
conflicting cultures. That Spain required a well-organized libertarian movement 
was hardly a matter of doubt among the majority of Spanish anarchists. But would 
this movement reflect a village society or a factory society? Where a conflict 
existed, could the two be melded in the same movement without violating the 
libertarian tenets of decentralization, mutual aid, and self-administration? In 
the classical era of "proletarian socialism" between 1848 and 1939, an era that 
stressed the "hegemony" of the industrial proletariat in all social struggles, 
Spanish anarchism followed a historic trajectory that revealed at once the 
limitations of the era itself and the creative possibilities for anarchic forms 
of organization.</p>

<p class="fst">By comparison with the cities, the Spanish villages that were 
committed to anarchism raised very few organizational problems. Brenan's 
emphasis on the braceros notwithstanding, the strength of agrarian anarchism in 
the south and the Levant lay in the mountain villages, not among the rural 
proletariat that worked the great plantations of Andalusia. In these relatively 
isolated villages, a fierce sense of independence and personal dignity whetted 
the bitter social hatreds engendered by poverty, creating the rural "patriarchs" 
of anarchism whose entire families were devoted almost apostolically to "the 
Idea." For these sharply etched and rigorously ascetic individuals, defiance of 
the State, the Church, and conventional authority in general was almost a way of 
life. Knitted together by the local press&#8212;and at various times there were 
hundreds of anarchist periodicals in Spain&#8212;they formed the sinews of agrarian 
anarchism from the 1870s onwards and, to a large extent, the moral conscience of 
Spanish anarchism throughout its history.</p>

<p class="fst">Their agrarian collectives reflected to a remarkable extent the 
organizational forms which the anarchists fostered among all the villages under 
their influence before the 1936 revolution. The revolution in rural communities 
essentially enlarged the old IWMA and later CNT nuclei, membership groups, or 
quite simply clans of closely knit anarchist families into popular assemblies. 
These usually met weekly and formulated the policy decisions of the community as 
a whole. The assembly form comprised the organizational ideal of village 
anarchism from the days of the first truly Bakuninist congress of the Spanish 
IWMA in Córdoba in 1872, stressing the libertarian traditions of Spanish village 
life.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> Where such popular 
assemblies were possible, their decisions were executed by a committee elected 
from the assembly. Apparently, the right to recall committee members was taken 
for granted and they certainly enjoyed no privileges, emoluments, or 
institutional power. Their influence was a function of their obvious dedication 
and capabilities. It remained a cardinal principle of Spanish anarchists never 
to pay their delegates, even when the CNT numbered a million members.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> 
Normally, the responsibilities of elected delegates had to be discharged after 
working hours. Almost all the evenings of anarchist militants were occupied with 
meetings of one sort or another. Whether at assemblies or committees, they 
argued, debated, voted, and administered, and when time afforded, they read and 
passionately discussed "the Idea" to which they dedicated not only their leisure 
hours but their very lives. For the greater part of the day, they were working 
men and women, <i>obrera consciente</i>, who abjured smoking and drinking, 
avoided brothels and the bloody bull ring, purged their talk of "foul" language, 
and by their probity, dignity, respect for knowledge, and militancy tried to set 
a moral example for their entire class. They never used the word "god" in their 
daily conversations (<i>salud</i> was preferred over <i>adios</i>) and avoided 
all official contact with clerical and state authorities, indeed, to the point 
where they refused to legally validate their lifelong "free unions" with marital 
documents and never baptized or confirmed their children. One must know Catholic 
Spain to realize how far-reaching were these self-imposed mores&#8212;and how 
quixotically consistent some of them were with the puritanical traditions of the 
country.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is appropriate to note at this point that the myth, widely 
disseminated by the current sociological literature on the subject, that 
agrarian anarchism in Spain was antitechnological in spirit and atavistically 
sought to restore a neolithic "Golden Age" can be quite effectively refuted by a 
close study of the unique educational role played by the anarchists. Indeed, it 
was the anarchists, with inexpensive, simply written brochures, who brought the 
French enlightenment and modern scientific theory to the peasantry, not the 
arrogant liberals or the disdainful Socialists. Together with pamphlets on 
Bakunin and Kropotkin, the anarchist press published simple accounts of the 
theories of natural and social evolution and elementary introductions to the 
secular culture of Europe. They tried to instruct the peasants in advanced 
techniques of land management and earnestly favored the use of agricultural 
machinery to lighten the burdens of toil and provide more leisure for 
self-development. Far from being an atavistic trend in Spanish society, as 
Hobsbawm (in his <i>Primitive Rebels</i>) and even Brenan would have us believe, 
I can say with certainty from a careful review of the issue that anarchism more 
closely approximated a radical popular enlightenment.</p>

<p class="fst">In their personal qualities, dedicated urban anarchists were not 
substantially different from their rural comrades. But in the towns and cities 
of Spain, these urban anarchists faced more difficult organizational problems. 
Their efforts to create libertarian forms of organization were favored, of 
course, by the fact that many Spanish workers were either former villagers or 
were only a generation or so removed from the countryside.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> 
Yet the prospect for libertarian organization in the cities and factories could 
not depend upon the long tradition of village collectivism&#8212;the strong sense of 
community&#8212;that existed in rural anarchist areas. For within the factory 
itself&#8212;the realm of toil, hierarchy, industrial discipline, and brute material 
necessity&#8212;"community" was more a function of the bourgeois division of labor 
with its exploitative, even competitive connotations, than of humanistic 
cooperation, playfully creative work, and mutual aid. Working-class solidarity 
depended less upon a shared meaningful life nourished by self-fulfilling work 
than the common enemy&#8212;the boss&#8212;who exploded any illusion that under capitalism 
the worker was more than an industrial resource, an object to be coldly 
manipulated and ruthlessly exploited. If anarchism can be partly regarded as a 
revolt of the individual against the industrial system, the profound truth that 
lies at the heart of that revolt is that the factory routine not only blunts the 
sensibility of the worker to the rich feast of life; it degrades the worker's 
image of his or her human potentialities, of his or her capacities to take 
direct control of the means for administering social life.</p>

<p class="fst">One of the unique virtues that distinguished the Spanish 
anarchists from socialists was their attempt to <i>transform</i> the factory 
domain itself&#8212;a transformation that was to be effected in the long run by their 
demand for workers' self-management of production, and more immediately, by 
their attempt to form libertarian organizations that culminated in the formation 
of the syndicalist CNT. However, the extent to which workers' self-management 
can actually <i>eliminate</i> alienated labor and <i>alter</i> the impact of the 
factory system on the worker's sensibilities requires, in my view, a more 
probing analysis than it has hitherto received. The problem of the impact of the 
factory system on workers became crucial as the proletarian element in the CNT 
grew, while the anarchists sought to develop characteristics of initiative and 
self-management that were directly opposed to the characteristics inculcated by 
the factory system.</p>

<p class="fst">No sizable radical movement in modern times had seriously asked 
itself if organizational forms had to be developed which promoted changes in the 
most fundamental behavior patterns of its members. How could the libertarian 
movement vitiate the spirit of obedience, of hierarchical organization, of 
leader-and-led relationships, of authority and command instilled by capitalist 
industry? It is to the lasting credit of Spanish anarchism&#8212;and of anarchism 
generally&#8212;that it posed this question.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> 
The term "integral personality" appears repeatedly in Spanish anarchist 
documents and tireless efforts were made to develop individuals who not only 
cerebrally accepted libertarian principles but tried to practice them. 
Accordingly, the organizational framework of the movement (as expressed in the 
IWMA, the CNT, and the FAI) was meant to be decentralized, to allow for the 
greatest degree of initiative and decision-making at the base, and to provide 
structural guarantees against the formation of a bureaucracy. These 
requirements, on the other hand, had to be balanced against the need for 
coordination, mobilized common action, and effective planning. The 
organizational history of anarchism in the cities and towns of Spain&#8212;the forms 
the anarchists created and those which they discarded&#8212;is largely an account of 
the pull between these two requirements and the extent to which one prevailed 
over the other. This tension was not merely a matter of experience and 
structural improvisation. In the long run, the outcome of the pull between 
decentralization and coordination depended on the ability of the most dedicated 
anarchists to affect the consciousness of the workers who entered anarchist 
influenced unions&#8212;specifically unions of a syndicalist character whose aims were 
not only to fight for immediate material gains but also to provide the 
infrastructure for a libertarian society.</p>

<p class="fst">Long before syndicalism became a popular term in the French labor 
movement of the late 1890s, it already existed in the early Spanish labor 
movement. The anarchist influenced Spanish Federation of the old IWMA, in my 
opinion, was distinctly syndicalist. At the founding congress of the Spanish 
Federation at Barcelona in June 1870, the "commission on the theme of the social 
organization of the workers" proposed a structure that would form a model for 
all later anarchosyndicalist labor unions in Spain, including the CNT. The 
commission suggested a typical syndicalist dual structure: organization by trade 
and organization by locality. Local trade organizations (<i>Secciones de oficio</i>) 
grouped together all workers from a common enterprise and vocation into large 
occupational federations (<i>Uniones de oficio</i>) whose primary function was 
to struggle around economic grievances and working conditions. A local 
organization of a miscellaneous trades gathered up all those workers from 
different vocations whose numbers were too small to constitute effective 
organizations along vocational lines. Paralleling these vocational 
organizations, in every community and region where the IWMA was represented, the 
different local <i>Secciones</i> were grouped together, irrespective of trade, 
into local geographic bodies (<i>Federaciones locales</i>) whose function was 
avowedly revolutionary&#8212;the administration of social and economic life on a 
decentralized libertarian basis.</p>

<p class="fst">This dual structure forms the bedrock of all syndicalist forms of 
organization. In Spain, as elsewhere, the structure was knitted together by 
workers' committees, which originated in individual shops, factories, and 
agricultural communities. Gathering together in assemblies, the workers elected 
from their midst the committees that presided over the affairs of the vocational <i>
Secciones de oficio</i> and the geographic <i>Federaciones locales</i>. They 
were federated into regional committees for nearly every large area of Spain. 
Every year, when possible, the workers elected the delegates to the annual 
congresses of the Spanish Federation of the IWMA, which in turn elected a 
national Federal Council. With the decline of the IWMA, syndicalist union 
federations surfaced and disappeared in different regions of Spain, especially 
Catalonia and Andalusia. The first was the rather considerable Workers' 
Federation of the 1880s. Following its suppression, Spanish anarchism contracted 
either to nonunion ideological groups such as the Anarchist Organization of the 
Spanish Region or to essentially regional union federations like the 
Catalan-based Pact of Union and Solidarity of the 1890s and Workers' Solidarity 
of the early 1900s. Except for the short-lived Federation of Workers' Societies 
of the Spanish Region, established in 1900 on the initiative of a Madrid 
bricklayers' union, no major national syndicalist federation appeared in Spain 
until the organization of the CNT in 1911. With the establishment of the CNT, 
Spanish syndicalism entered its most mature and decisive period. Considerably 
larger than its rival, the UGT, the CNT became the essential arena for anarchist 
agitation in Spain.</p>

<p class="fst">The CNT was not merely "founded"; it developed organically out 
of the Catalan Workers' Solidarity and its most consolidated regional 
federation, the Catalan federation (<i>Confederación Regional del Trabajo de 
Cataluña</i>.) Later, other regional federations were established from local 
unions in each province&#8212;many of them lingering on from the Federation of 
Workers' Societies of the Spanish Region&#8212;until there were eight by the early 
1930s. The national organization, in effect, was a loose collection of regional 
federations which were broken down into local and district federations and 
finally into <i>sindicatos</i>, or individual unions. These <i>sindicatos</i> 
(earlier, they were known by the dramatic name of <i>sociedades de resistancia 
al capital</i>&#8212;resistance societies to capital) were established on a vocational 
basis and, in typical syndicalist fashion, grouped into geographic and trade 
federations (<i>federaciones locales and sindicatos de oficio</i>) . To 
coordinate this structure, the annual congresses of the CNT elected a National 
Committee which was expected to occupy itself primarily with correspondence, the 
collection of statistics, and aid to prisoners.</p>

<p class="fst">The statutes of the Catalan regional federation provide us with 
the guidelines used for the national movement as a whole. According to these 
statutes, the organization was committed to "direct action," rejecting all 
"political and religious interference." Affiliated district and local 
federations were to be "governed by the greatest autonomy possible, it being 
understood by this that they have complete freedom in all the professional 
matters relating to the individual trades which integrate them." Each member was 
expected to pay monthly dues of ten centimes (a trifling sum) which was to be 
divided equally among the local organization, the Regional Confederation, the 
National Confederation, the union newspaper (<i>Solidaridad Obrera</i>&#8212;"Workers' 
Solidarity"), and the all-important special fund for "social prisoners."</p>

<p class="fst">By statute, the Regional Committee&#8212;the regional equivalent of the 
CNT's National Committee&#8212;was expected to be merely an administrative body. 
Although it clearly played a directive role in coordinating action, its 
activities were bound by policies established by the annual regional congress. 
In unusual situations, the Committee could consult local bodies, either by 
referendums or by written queries. In addition to the annual regional congresses 
at which the Regional Committee was elected, the Committee was obliged to call 
extraordinary congresses at the request of the majority of the local 
federations. The local federations, in turn, were given three months' notice 
before a regular congress so that they could "prepare the themes for 
discussion." Within a month before the congress, the Regional Committee was 
required to publish the submitted "themes" in the union newspaper, leaving 
sufficient time for the workers to define their attitudes toward the topics to 
be discussed and instruct their delegates accordingly. The delegations to the 
congress, whose voting power was determined by the num-ber of members they 
represented, were elected by general assemblies of workers convened by the local 
and district federations.</p>

<p class="fst">These statutes formed the basis for the CNT's practice up to the 
revolution of 1936. Although they notably lacked any provision for the recall of 
the committee members, the organization in its heroic period was more democratic 
than the statutes would seem to indicate. A throbbing vitality existed at the 
base of this immense organization, marked by active interest in the CNT's 
problems and considerable individual initiative. The workers' centers (<i>centros 
obreros</i>), which the anarchists had established in the days of the IWMA, were 
not only the local offices of the union; they were also meeting places and 
cultural centers where members went to exchange ideas and attend lectures. All 
the affairs of the local CNT were managed by committees of ordinary unpaid 
workers. Although the official union meetings were held only once in three 
months, there were "conferences of an instructive character" every Saturday 
night and Sunday afternoon. The solidarity of the <i>sindicatos</i> was so 
intense that it was not always possible to maintain an isolated strike. There 
was always a tendency for a strike to trigger off others in its support and 
generate active aid by other <i>sindicatos</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">In any case, this is the way the CNT tried to carry on its 
affairs and during favorable periods actually functioned. But there were periods 
when repression and sudden, often crucial, turns in events made it necessary to 
suspend annual or regional congresses and confine important policy-making 
decisions to plenums of leading committees or to "congresses" that were little 
more than patchwork conferences. Charismatic leaders at all levels of the 
organization came very close to acting in a bureaucratic manner. Nor is the 
syndicalist structure itself immune to bureaucratic deformations. It was not 
very difficult for an elaborate network of committees, building up to regional 
and national bodies, to assume all the features of a centralized organization 
and circumvent the wishes of the workers' assemblies at the base.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, the CNT, despite its programmatic commitment to 
libertarian communism and its attempt to function in a libertarian manner, was 
primarily a large trade union federation rather than a purely anarchist 
organization. Angel Pestaña, one of its most pragmatic leaders, recognized that 
roughly a third of the CNT membership could be regarded as anarchists. Many were 
militants rather than revolutionaries; others simply joined the CNT because it 
was the dominant union in their area or shop. And by the 1930s, the great 
majority of CNT members were workers rather than peasants. Andalusians, once the 
largest percentage of members in the anarchist-influenced unions of the previous 
century, had dwindled to a minority, a fact which is not noted by such writers 
as Brenan and Hobsbawm who overemphasize the importance of the rural element in 
the anarchosyndicalist trade unions.</p>

<p class="fst">With the slow change in the social composition of the CNT and the 
growing supremacy of industrial over village values in its leadership and 
membership, it is my view that the confederation would have eventually turned 
into a fairly conventional Latin-type of trade union. The Spanish anarchists 
were not oblivious to these developments. Although syndicalist unions formed the 
major arena of anarchist activity in Europe, anarchist theorists were mindful 
that it would not be too difficult for reformist leaders in syndicalist unions 
to shift organizational control from the bottom to the top. They viewed 
syndicalism as a change in focus from the commune to the trade union, from all 
the oppressed to the industrial proletariat, from the streets to the factories, 
and, in emphasis at least, from insurrection to the general strike.</p>

<p class="fst">Malatesta, fearing the emergence of a bureaucracy in the 
syndicalist unions, warned that "the official is to the working class a danger 
only comparable to that provided by the parliamentarian; both lead to corruption 
and from corruption to death is but a short step." Although he was to change his 
attitude toward syndicalism, he accepted the movement with many reservations and 
never ceased to emphasize that "trade unions are, by their very nature, 
reformist and never revolutionary." To this warning he added that the 
"revolutionary spirit must be introduced, developed and maintained by the 
constant actions of revolutionaries who work from within their ranks as well as 
from outside, but it cannot be the normal, natural definition of the Trade 
Union's function."</p>

<p class="fst">Syndicalism had divided the Spanish anarchist movement without 
really splitting it. Indeed, until the establishment of the FAI, there was 
rarely a national anarchist organization to split.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> 
Yet a Spanish anarchist movement held together on two levels: by means of 
well-known periodicals like <i>
La Revista Blanca and Tierra y Libertad</i>, and in the form of small circles of 
dedicated anarchists, both inside and outside the syndicalist unions. Dating as 
far back as the 1880s these typically Hispanic groups of intimates, 
traditionally known as <i>tertulias</i>, met at favorite cafes to discuss ideas 
and plan actions. They gave themselves colorful names expressive of their 
high-minded ideals (<i>Ni Rey ni patria</i>) or their revolutionary spirit (<i>Los 
Rebeldes</i>) or quite simply their sense of fraternity (<i>Los Afines</i>) . 
The Anarchist Organization of the Spanish Region to which I have already 
alluded, founded in Valencia in 1888, consciously made these <i>tertulias</i> 
the strands from which it tried to weave a coherent movement. Decades later, 
they were to reappear in the FAI as <i>grupos de afinidad</i> (affinity groups) 
with a more formal local and national structure.</p>

<p class="fst">Although Spanish anarchism did not produce an effective national 
movement until the founding of the FAI, the divisions between the 
anarchosyndicalists and anarchocommunists were highly significant. The two 
tendencies of Spanish anarchism worked in very different ways and were mutually 
disdainful of each other. The anarchosyndicalists functioned directly in the 
unions. They accepted key union positions and placed their emphasis on 
organizing, often at the expense of propaganda and ideological commitment. As 
"practical men," Catalan anarchosyndicalists such as José Rodríguez Romero and 
Tomás Herreros were ready to make compromises, more precisely, to form alliances 
with "pure-and-simple" trade unionists.</p>

<p class="fst">The anarchocommunists were the "fanatics over there" in the 
editorial offices of <i>Tierra y Libertad</i>&#8212;"purists" like Juan Barón and 
Francisco Cardenal, who regarded the anarchosyndicalists as deserters to 
reformism and held faithfully to the communist doctrines that formed the basis 
of the old Anarchist Organization of the Spanish Region. They were not disposed 
to trade union activism and stressed commitment to libertarian communist 
principles. It was not their goal to produce a large "mass movement" of workers 
who wore lightly the trappings of libertarian ideals, but to help create 
dedicated anarchists in an authentically revolutionary movement, however small 
its size or influence. Once fairly influential, their terrorist tactics at the 
turn of the century and the ensuing repression had greatly depleted their 
numbers.</p>

<p class="fst">The founding of the FAI in the summer of 1927 was expected to 
unite these two tendencies. Anarchosyndicalist needs were met by requiring that 
every <i>faísta</i> become a member of the CNT and by making the union the 
principal arena of anarchist activity in Spain. The needs of the 
anarchocommunists were met by the very fact that an avowedly anarchist 
organization was established nationally, apart from the CNT, and by making the 
affinity group the basis for a vanguard movement avowedly dedicated to the 
achievement of libertarian communism.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> <i>
Tierra y Libertad</i> was adopted as the FAI's organ. But by establishing an 
anarchist organization for the express purpose of controlling the CNT, or at 
least to keep it from falling into the hands of reformists or infiltrators from 
the newly founded Spanish Communist Party, the anarchosyndicalists had 
essentially enveloped the anarchocommunists in syndicalist activity. By 1933, 
the FAI's control over the CNT was fairly complete. Systematic organizational 
work had purged the union of Communists, while its reformist leaders either left 
on their own accord or had defensively camouflaged themselves with revolutionary 
rhetoric. No illusion should exist that this success was achieved with an overly 
sensitive regard for democratic niceties, although the militancy of the <i>
faístas</i> unquestionably attracted the greatest majority of CNT workers. But 
the FAI's most well-known militants&#8212;Durruti, the Ascaso brothers, García 
Oliver&#8212;included terrorism in their repertory of direct action. Gunplay, 
especially in "expropriations" and in dealing with recalcitrant employers, 
police agents, and blacklegs, was not frowned upon. These <i>atentados</i> 
almost certainly intimidated the FAI's less prominent opponents in the CNT, 
although "reformists" like Pestaña and Peiró did not hesitate to publicly 
criticize the FAI in the harshest terms.</p>

<p class="fst">Despite its influence in the CNT, this remarkable anarchist 
organization remained semisecret up to 1936 and its membership probably did not 
exceed 30,000. Structurally, it formed a near-model of libertarian organization. 
Affinity groups were small nuclei of intimate friends which generally numbered a 
dozen or so men and women. Wherever several of these affinity groups existed, 
they were coordinated by a local federation and met, when possible, in monthly 
assemblies. The national movement, in turn, was coordinated by a Peninsular 
Committee, which ostensibly exercised very little directive power. Its role was 
meant to be strictly administrative in typical Bakuninist fashion. Affinity 
groups were in fact remarkably autonomous during the early thirties and often 
exhibited exceptional initiative. The intimacy shared by the <i>faístas</i> in 
each group made the movement very difficult for police agents to infiltrate and 
the FAI as a whole managed to survive the most severe repression with 
surprisingly little damage to its organization. As time passed, however, the 
Peninsular Committee began to grow in prestige. Its periodic statements on 
events and problems often served as directives to the entire movement. Although 
by no means an authoritarian body, it eventually began to function as a central 
committee whose policy decisions, while not binding in the organization, served 
as more than mere suggestions. Indeed, it would have been very difficult for the 
Peninsular Committee to operate by fiat; the average <i>faísta</i> was a strong 
personality who would have readily voiced disagreement with any decision that he 
or she found particularly unpalatable. But the FAI increasingly became an end in 
itself and loyalty to the organization, particularly when it was under attack or 
confronted with severe difficulties, tended to mute criticism.</p>

<p class="fst">There can be no question that the FAI raised enormously the 
social consciousness of the average <i>ceneteista</i>. More than any single 
force apart from employer recalcitrance, it made the CNT into a revolutionary 
syndicalist organization, if not a truly anarchosyndicalist one. The FAI 
stressed a commitment to revolution and to libertarian communism and gained a 
considerable following within the CNT (a more dedicated following in anarchist 
Saragossa than in syndicalist Barcelona). But the FAI was not able to completely 
rid the CNT of reformist elements (the union attracted many workers by its 
militant fight for improved economic conditions) and the sedimentation of the 
CNT along hierarchical lines continued.</p>

<p class="fst">In its attempt to control the CNT, the FAI in fact became a 
victim of the less developed elements in the union. Peirats quite rightly 
emphasizes that the CNT took its own toll on the FAI. Just as reformists inside 
the union were predisposed to compromise with the bourgeoisie and the State, so 
the FAI was compelled to compromise with the reformists in order to retain its 
control over the CNT. Among the younger, less experienced <i>faístas</i>, the 
situation was sometimes worse. Extravagant militancy which fetishized action 
over theory and daring over insight rebounded, after failure, in the crudest 
opportunism.</p>

<p class="fst">In the balance: the CNT had provided a remarkably democratic 
arena for the most militant working class in Europe; the FAI added the leavening 
of a libertarian orientation and revolutionary deeds within the limits that a 
trade union could provide. By 1936, both organizations had created authentically 
libertarian structures to the extent that any strictly proletarian class 
movement could be truly libertarian. If only by dint of sheer rhetoric&#8212;and 
doubtless, considerable conviction and daring actions&#8212;they had keyed the 
expectations of their memberships to a revolution that would yield workers' 
control of the economy and syndicalist forms of social administration. This 
process of education and class organization, more than any single factor in 
Spain, produced the collectives. And to the degree that the CNT-FAI (for the two 
organizations became fatally coupled after July 1936) exercised the major 
influence in an area, the collectives proved to be generally more durable, 
communist and resistant to Stalinist counterrevolution than other 
republican-held areas of Spain.</p>

<p class="fst">Moreover, in the CNT-FAI areas, workers and peasants tended to 
show the greatest degree of popular initiative in resisting the military 
uprising. It was not Socialist Madrid that first took matters into its own hands 
and defeated its rebellious garrison: it was anarchosyndicalist Barcelona that 
can lay claim to this distinction among all the large cities of Spain. Madrid 
rose against the Montana barracks only after sound trucks broadcast the news 
that the army had been defeated in the streets and squares of Barcelona. And 
even in Madrid, perhaps the greatest initiative was shown by the local CNT 
organization, which enjoyed the allegiance of the city's militant construction 
workers.</p>

<p class="fst">The CNT-FAI, in effect, revealed all the possibilities of a 
highly organized and extremely militant working class&#8212;a "classical" proletariat, 
if you will, whose basic economic interests were repeatedly frustrated by a 
myopic intransigent bourgeoisie. It was out of such "irreconcilable" struggles 
that anarchosyndicalism and revolutionary Marxism had developed their entire 
tactical and theoretical armamentorium.</p>

<p class="fst">But the CNT-FAI also revealed the limitations of that type of 
classical struggle&#8212;and it is fair to say that the Spanish Revolution marked the 
end of a century-long era of so-called "proletarian revolutions" which began 
with the June uprising of the Parisian workers in 1848. The era has passed into 
history and, in my view, will never again be revived. It was marked by bitter, 
often uncompromising struggles between the proletariat and bourgeoisie, an era 
in which the working class had not been admitted into its "share" of economic 
life and had been virtually denied the right to form its own protective 
institutions. Industrial capitalism in Spain was still a relatively new 
phenomenon, neither affluent enough to mitigate working class unrest nor sure of 
its place in political life&#8212;yet still asserting an unqualified right to 
ruthlessly exploit its "hired hands." But this new phenomenon was already 
beginning to find its way if not toward traditional European liberal political 
forms, then toward authoritarian ones which would give it the breathing space to 
develop.</p>

<p class="fst">The economic crisis of the thirties (which radicals throughout 
the world viewed as the final "chronic crisis" of capitalism), coupled with the 
myopic policies of the Spanish liberals and ruling classes, turned the class 
struggle in Spain into an explosive class war. The agrarian reform policies of 
the early thirties republic turned out to be farcical. The liberals were more 
preoccupied with baiting the Church than dealing seriously with the long-range 
or even short-range economic problems of the peninsula. The Socialists, who 
joined the liberals in governing the country, were more concerned with promoting 
the growth of the UGT at the expense of the CNT than in improving the material 
conditions of the working class as a whole. The CNT, strongly influenced by 
volatile the <i>faístas</i> whose radical education had been acquired in the <i>
pistolero</i> battles of the early twenties, exploded into repeated 
insurrections&#8212;uprisings which its leaders probably knew were futile, but were 
meant to stimulate the revolutionary spirit of the working class. These failures 
by all the elements of Spain in the early republican years to meet the promise 
of reform left no recourse but revolution and civil war. Except for the most 
dedicated anarchists, it was a conflict that no one really wanted. But between 
1931, when the monarchy was overthrown, and 1936, when the generals rebelled, 
everyone was sleep-walking into the last of the great proletarian 
revolutions&#8212;perhaps the greatest in terms of its short-lived social programs and 
the initiative shown by the oppressed. The era seemed to have collected all its 
energies, its traditions, and its dreams for its last great confrontation&#8212;and 
thereafter was to disappear.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not surprising that the most communistic collectives in the 
Spanish Revolution appeared in the countryside rather than the cities, among 
villagers who were still influenced by archaic collectivistic traditions and 
were less ensnared in a market economy than their urban cousins. The ascetic 
values which so greatly influenced these highly communistic collectives often 
reflected the extreme poverty of the areas in which they were rooted. 
Cooperation and mutual aid in such cases formed the preconditions for survival 
of the community. Elsewhere, in the more arid areas of Spain, the need for 
sharing water and maintaining irrigation works was an added inducement to 
collective farming. Here, collectivization was also a technological necessity, 
but one which even the republic did not interfere with. What makes these rural 
collectives important is not only that many of them practiced communism, but 
that they functioned so effectively under a system of popular self-management. 
This belies the notion held by so many authoritarian Marxists that economic life 
must be scrupulously "planned" by a highly centralized state power and the 
odious canard that popular collectivization, as distinguished from statist 
nationalization, necessarily pits collectivized enterprises against each other 
in competition for profits and resources.</p>

<p class="fst">In the cities, however, collectivization of the factories, 
communications systems, and transport facilities took a very different form. 
Initially nearly the entire economy in CNT-FAI areas had been taken over by 
committees elected from among the workers and were loosely coordinated by higher 
union committees. As time went on this system was increasingly tightened. The 
higher committee began to preempt the initiative to the lower although their 
decisions still had to be ratified by the workers of the facilities involved. 
The effect of this process was to tend to centralize the economy of CNT-FAI 
areas in the hands of the union. The extent to which this process unfolded 
varied greatly from industry to industry and area to area, and with the limited 
knowledge we have at hand, generalizations are very difficult to formulate. With 
the entry of the CNT-FAI into the Catalan government in 1936, the process of 
centralization continued and the union-controlled facilities became wedded to 
the state. By early 1938 a political bureaucracy had largely supplanted the 
authority of the workers' committees in all "republican"-held cities. Although 
workers' control existed in theory, it had virtually disappeared in fact.</p>

<p class="fst">If the commune formed the basis for the rural collectives, the 
committee formed the basis for the industrial collectives. Indeed, apart from 
the rural communes, the committee system predominated wherever the State power 
had collapsed&#8212;in villages and towns as well as factories and urban 
neighborhoods. "All had been set up in the heat of action to direct the popular 
response to the military coup d'état," observe Pierre Broué and Emile Témime:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"They had been appointed in an infinite number of ways. In the 
villages, the factories, and on the work sites, time had sometimes been taken to 
elect them, at least summarily, at a general meeting. At all events, care had 
been taken to see that all parties and unions were represented on them, even if 
they did not exist before the Revolution, because the Committee represented at 
one and the same time as the workers a whole and the sum total of their 
organizations: in more than one place those elected came to an understanding as 
to who was to represent one or another union, who would be the 'Republican' and 
who the 'Socialist.' Very often, in the towns, the most active elements 
appointed themselves. It was sometimes the electors as a whole who chose the men 
to sit on the Committee of each organization, but more often the members of the 
Committee were elected either by a vote within their own organization or were 
quite simply appointed by the local governing committees of the parties and 
unions."</p>

<p class="fst">The nearly forty years that separate our own time from the 
Spanish revolution have produced sweeping changes in Western Europe and America, 
changes that are also reflected in Spain's present social development. The 
classical proletariat that fought so desperately for the minimal means of life 
is giving way to a more affluent worker whose main concern is not material 
survival and employment, but a more human way of life and meaningful work. The 
social composition of the labor force is changing as well&#8212;proportionately, more 
toward commercial, service, and professional vocations than unskilled labor in 
mass manufacturing industries. Spain, like the rest of Western Europe, is no 
longer predominantly an agricultural country; the majority of its people live in 
towns and cities, not in the relatively isolated villages that nourished rural 
collectivism. In a visit to working class Barcelona during the late sixties, I 
seemed to see as many American-style attaché cases as lunch boxes.</p>

<p class="fst">These changes in the goals and traits of the nonbourgeois classes 
in capitalist society are the products of the sweeping industrial revolution 
that followed the Second World War and of the relative affluence or expectations 
of affluence that have brought all the values of material scarcity into question 
They have introduced a historic tension between the irrationality of present 
lifeways and the utopian promise of a liberated society. The young workers of 
the late sixties and early seventies tend to borrow their values from relatively 
affluent middle-class youth, who no longer hypostasize the work ethic, 
puritanical mores, hierarchical obedience, and material security, but rather 
free time for self-development, sexual liberation in the broadest sense of the 
term, creative or stimulating work as distinguished from mindless labor, and an 
almost libidinal disdain for all authority. In Spain it is significant that 
privileged university students, who tended to play a reactionary role in the 
thirties, are among the most radical elements of society in the sixties and 
seventies. Together with young workers and intellectuals in all fields, they are 
beginning to accept in varying degrees the personalistic and utopistic goals 
that make the puritanical and overly institutionalized anarchosyndicalism of the 
CNT-FAI seem anachronistic.</p>

<p class="fst">The limitations of the trade union movement, even in its 
anarchosyndicalist form, have become manifestly clear. To see in trade unions 
(whether syndicalist or not) an inherent potentiality for revolutionary struggle 
is to assume that the interests of workers and capitalists, <i>merely as classes</i>, 
are intrinsically incompatible. This is demonstrably untrue if one is willing to 
acknowledge the obvious capacity of the system to remake or to literally create 
the worker in the image of a repressive industrial culture and rationality. From 
the family, through the school and religious institutions, the mass media, to 
the factory and finally trade union and "revolutionary" party, capitalist 
society conspires to foster obedience, hierarchy, the work ethic, and 
authoritarian discipline in the working class as a whole; indeed, in many of its 
"emancipatory" movements as well.</p>

<p class="fst">The factory and the class organizations that spring from it play 
the most the compelling role in promoting a well-regulated, almost unconscious 
docility in mature workers&#8212;a docility that manifests itself not so much in 
characterless passivity as in a pragmatic commitment to hierarchical 
organizations and authoritarian leaders. Workers can be very militant and 
exhibit strong, even powerful character traits in the most demanding social 
situations; but these traits can be brought as much, if not more readily, to the 
service of a reformist labor bureaucracy as to a libertarian revolutionary 
movement. They must break with the hold of bourgeois culture on their 
sensibilities&#8212;specifically, with the hold of the factory, the locus of the 
workers' very <i>class</i> existence&#8212;before they can move into that supreme form 
of direct action called "revolution," and further, construct a society they will <i>
directly</i> control in their workshops and communities.</p>

<p class="fst">This amounts to saying that workers must see themselves as human 
beings, not as class beings; as creative personalities, not as "proletarians"; 
as self-affirming individuals, not as "masses." And the destiny of a liberated 
society must be the free commune, not the confederation of factories, however 
self-administered; for such a confederation takes a part of society&#8212;its economic 
component&#8212;and reifies it into the totality of society. Indeed, even that 
economic component must be humanized precisely by our bringing an "affinity of 
friendship" to the work process, by diminishing the role of onerous work in the 
lives of the producers, indeed, by a total "transvaluation of values" (to use 
Nietzsche's phrase) as it applies to production and consumption as well as 
social and personal life.</p>

<p class="fst">Even though certain aspects of the libertarian revolution in 
Spain have lost their relevance, anarchist concepts themselves that can 
encompass and fully express a "post-scarcity mentality" can be much more 
relevant to the present than the authoritarian ideologies of the 1930s, despite 
the tendency of these ideologies to fill the vacuum left by the absence of 
meaningful libertarian alternatives and organizations. Such anarchist concepts 
could no longer rely in practical terms on the collectivist traditions of the 
countryside; these traditions are virtually gone as living forces although 
perhaps the memory of the old collectivist traditions lives among Spanish youth 
in the same sense that American youth have turned to the tribal traditions of 
the American Indians for cultural inspiration. With the decline of the nuclear 
family and in reaction to urban atomization, the commune has everywhere acquired 
a new relevance for young and even older people&#8212;a shared, mutually supportive 
way of life based on <i>selective</i> affinity rather than kinship ties. 
Burgeoning urbanization has posed more sharply than ever the need for 
decentralistic alternatives to the megalopolis; the gigantism of the city, the 
need for the human scale. The grotesque bureaucratization of life, which in 
Camus's words reduces everyone to a functionary, has placed a new value on 
nonauthoritarian institutions and direct action. Slowly, even amidst the 
setbacks of our time, a new self is being forged. Potentially, this is a 
libertarian self that could intervene directly in the changing and 
administration of society&#8212;a self that could engage in the self-discipline, 
self-activity, and self-management so crucial to the development of a truly free 
society. Here the values prized so highly by traditional anarchocommunism 
establish direct continuity with a contemporary form of anarchocommunism that 
gives consciousness and coherence to the intuitive impulses of this new 
sensibility.</p>

<p class="fst">But if these goals are to be achieved, contemporary 
anarchocommunism cannot remain a mere mood or tendency, wafting in the air like 
a cultural ambiance It must be organized&#8212;indeed, <i>well</i>-organized&#8212;if it is 
to effectively articulate and spread this new sensibility; it must have a 
coherent theory and extensive literature; it must be capable of dueling with the 
authoritarian movements that try to denature the intuitive libertarian impulses 
of our time and channel social unrest into hierarchical forms of organization. 
On this score, Spanish anarchism is profoundly relevant for our time, and the 
Spanish Revolution still provides the most valuable lessons in the problem of 
self-management that we can cull from the past.</p>

<p class="fst">To deal with these problems, perhaps I can best begin by saying 
that there is little, in fact, to criticize in the structural forms that the CNT 
and the FAI tried to establish. The CNT, almost from the outset, organized its 
locals as factory rather than craft unions, and the nationwide occupational 
federations (the <i>Uniones de oficio</i>, or "internationals" as we would call 
them) which emerged with the IWMA were abandoned for local federations (the <i>
Federaciones locales</i>). This structure situated the factory in the community, 
where it really belonged if the "commune" concept was to be realistic, rather 
than in an easily manipulatable industrial network that easily lent itself to 
statist nationalization The <i>centros obreros</i>, the local federations, the 
careful mandating of delegates to congresses, the elimination of paid officials, 
the establishment of regional federations, regional committees, and even a 
National Committee, would all have been in conformity with libertarian 
principles had all of these institutions lived up their intentions. Where the 
CNT structure failed most seriously was in the need to convene frequent 
assemblies of workers at the local level, and similarly, frequent national and 
regional conferences to continually reevaluate CNT policies and prevent power 
from collecting in the higher committees. For as frequent as meetings may have 
been&#8212;committees, subcommittees, and regional and national committee meetings&#8212;the 
regular and close communication between workers and the "influential militants" 
did tend to become ruptured.</p>

<p class="fst">Confusion developed over the crucial problem of the locus for 
making policy decisions. The real place for this process should have been shop 
assemblies, regular congresses, or when events and circumstances required rapid 
decisions, conferences of clearly mandated and recallable delegates elected for 
this purpose by the membership. The sole responsibility of the regional and 
national committees should have been administrative&#8212;that is, the coordination 
and execution of policy decisions formulated by membership meetings and 
conference or congress delegates.</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, the structure of the CNT as a syndicalist union and 
that of the FAI as an anarchist federation was, in many respects, quite 
admirable. Indeed, my principal criticisms in the pages above have been not so 
much of the forms themselves, but of the departures the CNT and the FAI made 
from them. Perhaps even more significantly, I've tried to explain the social 
limitations of the period&#8212;including the mystique about the classical 
proletariat&#8212;that vitiated the realization of these structural forms.</p>

<p class="fst">Another issue that was a crucial problem for the FAI and which is 
still a source of confusion for anarchists at the present time is the problem of 
the "influential militant"&#8212;the more informed, experienced, "strong," and 
oratorically gifted individuals who tended to formulate policy at all levels of 
the organization.</p>

<p class="fst">It will never be possible to eliminate the fact that human beings 
have different levels of knowledge and consciousness. Our prolonged period of 
dependence as children, the fact that we are largely the products of an acquired 
culture and that experience tends to confer knowledge on the older person would 
lead to such differences even in the most liberated society. In hierarchical 
societies, the dependence of the less-informed on the more-informed is commonly 
a means of manipulation and power. The older, more experienced person, like the 
parent, has this privilege at his or her disposal and, with it, an alternative: 
to use knowledge, experience, and oratorical gifts as means of domination and to 
induce adulation&#8212;or for the goal of lovingly imparting knowledge and experience, 
for equalizing the relationship between teacher and taught, and always leaving 
the less experienced and informed individual free to make his or her decisions.</p>

<p class="fst">Hegel brilliantly draws the distinction between Socrates and 
Jesus: the former was a teacher who sought to arouse a quest for knowledge in 
anyone who was prepared to discuss; the latter, an oracle who pronounced for 
adoring disciples to interpret exegetically. The difference, as Hegel points 
out, lay not only in the character of the two men but in that of their 
"followers." Socrates' friends had been reared in a social tradition that 
"developed their powers in many directions. They had absorbed that democratic 
spirit which gives an individual a greater measure of independence and makes it 
impossible for any tolerably good head to depend wholly and absolutely on one 
person. ... They loved Socrates because of his virtue and his philosophy, not 
virtue and his philosophy because of him." The followers of Jesus, on the other 
hand, were submissive acolytes: "Lacking any great store of spiritual energy of 
their own, they had found the basis of their conviction about the teaching of 
Jesus principally in their friendship with him and dependence on him. They had 
not attained truth and freedom by their own exertions; only by laborious 
learning had they acquired a dim sense of them and certain formulas about them. 
Their ambition was to grasp and keep this doctrine faithfully and to transmit it 
equally faithfully to others without any addition, without letting it acquire 
any variations in detail by working on it themselves."</p>

<p class="fst">The FAI&#8212;illegal by choice, sometimes terrorist in its tactics, 
and aggressively "macho" in its almost competitive daring&#8212;developed deeply 
personal ties within its affinity groups. Durruti's grief for the death of 
Francisco Ascaso revealed real love, not merely the friendship that stems from 
organizational collaboration. But in the FAI both friendship and love were often 
based on a demanding association, one that implicitly required conformity to the 
most "heroic" standards established by the most "daring" militants in the group. 
Such relationships are not likely to shatter over doctrinal disagreements or 
what often seem like "mere" points of theory. Eventually these relationships 
produce leaders and led; worse, the leaders tended to patronize the led and 
finally manipulate them.</p>

<p class="fst">To escape this process of devolution, an anarchist organization 
must be aware of the fact that the process can occur, and it must be vigilant 
against its occurrence. To be effective, the vigilance must eventually express 
itself in more positive terms. It cannot coexist with an adulation of violence, 
competitive daring, and mindless aggressiveness, not to speak of an equally 
mindless worship of activism and "strong characters." The organization must 
recognize that differences in experiences and consciousness <i>do</i> exist 
among its members and handle these differences with a wary consciousness&#8212;not 
conceal them with euphemisms like "influential militant." The taught as well as 
the teacher must first ask himself or herself whether domination and 
manipulation is being practiced&#8212;and not to deny that a systematic teaching 
process is taking place. Moreover, everyone must be fully aware that this 
teaching process is unavoidable within the movement if relationships are 
eventually to be equalized by imparted knowledge and the fruits of experience. 
To a large extent, the conclusions one arrives about the nature of this process 
are almost intuitively determinable by the behavior patterns that develop 
between comrades. Ultimately, under conditions of freedom, social intercourse, 
friendship, and love would be of the "free-giving" kind that Jacob Bachofen 
imputed to "matriarchal" society, not the demanding censorious type he 
associated with patriarchy. Here, the affinity group or commune would achieve 
the most advanced and libertarian expression of its humanity. Merely to strive 
for this goal among its own brothers and sisters would qualitatively distinguish 
it from other movements and provide the most assurable guarantee that it would 
remain true to its libertarian principles.</p>

<p class="fst">Our period, which stresses the development of the individual self 
as well as social self-management, stands in a highly advantageous position to 
assess the authentic nature of libertarian organization and relationships. A 
European or American civil war of the kind that wasted Spain in the thirties is 
no longer conceivable in an epoch that can deploy nuclear weapons, supersonic 
aircraft, nerve gas, and a terrifying firepower against revolutionaries. 
Capitalist institutions must be hollowed out by a molecular historical process 
of disengagement and disloyalty to a point where any popular majoritarian 
movement can cause them to collapse for want of support and moral authority. But 
the kind of development such a change will produce&#8212;whether it will occur 
consciously or not, whether it will have an authoritarian outcome or one based 
on self-management&#8212;will depend very much upon whether a conscious, 
well-organized libertarian movement can emerge.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1]</a> Both the UGT and the CNT probably numbered more than a million 
members each by the summer of 1936. The officious, highly bureaucratic UGT 
tended to overstate its membership figures. The more amorphous decentralized 
CNT&#8212;the more persecuted of the two labor federations&#8212;often exercised much 
greater influence on the Spanish working class than its membership statistics 
would seem to indicate.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n2" href="#fn2">[2]</a> Madrid, although with a largely Socialist labor movement, was 
the home of an intensely active anarchist movement. Not only were the Madrid 
construction workers strongly anarchosyndicalist, but at the turn of the 
century, many Madrid intellectuals were committed to anarchism and established a 
renowned theoretical tradition for the movement that lingered on long after 
anarchist workers had cut their ties with the Spanish intelligentsia.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n3" href="#fn3">[3]</a> I would not want to argue here, that the Spanish village 
formed a <i>paradigm</i> for a libertarian society. Village society differed 
greatly from one region of Spain to another&#8212;some areas retaining undisturbed 
their local democratic traditions, others ruled tyrannically by the Church, the 
nobility, <i>caciques</i>, and custom. Quite often, both tendencies coexisted in 
a very uneasy equilibrium, the democratic still vital but submerged by the 
authoritarian.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n4" href="#fn4">[4]</a> In the case of the CNT there were exceptions to this rule. The 
National Secretary was paid an average worker's salary, as was the clerical 
staff of the National Committee and the editors and staffs of daily newspapers. 
But delegates to the national, regional, and local committees of the CNT were 
not paid and were obliged to work at their own trades except when they lost time 
during working hours on union business. This is not to say that there were no 
individuals who devoted most of their time to the dissemination of anarchist 
ideas. "Traveling about from place to place, on foot or mule or on the hard 
seats of third-class railway carriages, or even like tramps or ambulant 
bullfighters under the tarpaulins of goods wagons," observes Brenan, "whilst 
they organized new groups or carried on propagandist campaigns, these 'apostles 
of the idea,' as they were called, lived like mendicant friars on the 
hospitality of the more prosperous workers"&#8212;and, I would add, "villagers." This 
tradition of organizing, which refers to the 1870s, did not disappear in later 
decades; to the contrary, it became more systematic and perhaps more securely 
financed as the CNT began to compete with the UGT for the allegiance of the 
Spanish workers and peasants.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n5" href="#fn5">[5]</a> Yet here I must add that to abstain from smoking, to live by 
high moral standards, and especially to abjure the consumption of alcohol was 
very important at the time. Spain was going through her own belated industrial 
revolution during the period of anarchist ascendancy with all its demoralizing 
features. The collapse of morale among the proletariat, with rampant drunkenness 
and venereal diseases, and the collapse of sanitary facilities, was the foremost 
problem which Spanish revolutionaries had to deal with, just as black radicals 
today must deal with similar problems in the ghetto. On this score, the Spanish 
anarchists were eminently successful. Few CNT workers, much less committed 
anarchists, would have dared to show up drunk at meetings or misbehave overtly 
among their comrades. If one considers the terrible working and living 
conditions of the period, alcoholism was not as serious a problem in Spain as it 
was in England during the industrial revolution.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> In "black" (purely anarchistic) Saragossa, where the working 
class was even more firmly committed to anarchist principles than the Barcelona 
proletariat, Raymond Carr quite accurately emphasizes that "strikes were 
characterized by their scorn for economic demands and the toughness of their 
revolutionary solidarity: strikes for comrades in prison were more popular than 
strikes for better conditions."</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n7" href="#fn7">[7]</a> For Marx and Engels, organizational forms to change the 
behavioral patterns of the proletariat were not a problem. This question could 
be postponed until "after the revolution." Indeed, Marx viewed the authoritarian 
impact of the factory ("the very mechanism of the process of capitalist 
production itself") as a positive factor in producing a disciplined, united 
proletariat. Engels, in an atrocious diatribe against the anarchists titled "On 
Authority," explicitly used the factory structure&#8212;its hierarchical forms and the 
obedience it demanded&#8212;to justify his commitment to authority and centralization 
in working-class organizations. What is of interest here is not whether Marx and 
Engels were "authoritarians" but the way in which they thought out the problem 
of proletarian organization&#8212;the extent to which the matrix for their 
organizational concepts was the very economy which the social revolution was 
meant to revolutionize.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n8" href="#fn8">[8]</a> The disappearance of Bakunin's Alliance of Social Democracy in 
Spain scattered the forces of Spanish anarchism into small local nuclei which 
related on a regional basis through conferences, periodicals, and 
correspondence. Several regional federations of these nuclei were formed, mainly 
in Catalonia and Andalusia, only to disappear as rapidly as they emerged.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n9" href="#fn9">[9]</a> I employ the word "vanguard" provocatively, despite its 
unpopularity in many libertarian circles today, because this term was widely 
used in the traditional anarchist movement. Some anarchist publications even 
adopted it as a name. There can be no doubt that an anarchist <i>obrera 
consciente</i> regarded himself or herself as an "advanced person" and part of a 
small <i>avant-garde</i> in society. In its most innocuous sense, the use of 
this term meant that such a person merely enjoyed a more advanced social 
consciousness than the majority of less developed workers and peasants, a 
distinction that had to be overcome by education. In a less innocuous sense, the 
word provided a rationale for elitism and manipulation, to which some anarchist 
leaders were no more immune than their authoritarian Socialist opponents. The 
word "leader," on the other hand, was eschewed for the euphemism "influential 
militant," although in fact the more well-known anarchist "influential 
militants" were certainly leaders. This self-deception was not as trifling as it 
may seem. It prevented the Spanish anarchists from working out the serious 
problems that emerged from real differences in consciousness among themselves or 
between themselves and the great majority of undeveloped <i>ceneteistas</i>.</p>
