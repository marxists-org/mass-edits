<hr>

<p class="information"><i>Root &amp; Branch</i> No. 4 (1973), pp. 23-29. In reply to Jeremy Brecher's review of 
<i>Post-Scarcity Anarchism</i>.</p>

<hr>

<p class="fst">I take Jeremy Brecher to be a decent, intelligent, and honest guy 
whom I know personally and like very much. Hence when Jeremy comes out with a 
37-page (typescript) review of my book, <i>Post-Scarcity Anarchism</i>, that 
misinterprets important aspects of the book, I must work with the assumption 
that he wears blinders that restrict his vision and is burdened by prejudgements 
that make it difficult for him to evaluate its contents. The review is one of 
those shot-gun blasts that scatters pellets all over the place. To pick out each 
pellet and examine it carefully would require a work at least five times the 
size of Jeremy's, which time (and I suspect, space) make prohibitive. So I shall 
have to content myself with a critical overall evaluation of the review and cite 
a few examples of Jeremy's misinterpretations.</p>

<p class="fst">The review in high Marxist fashion begins with an attempt to 
locate the "social origins" of my outlook&#8212;the youth revolt and the 
counterculture of the sixties&#8212;which for Jeremy is already pretty much of a "dead 
dog." "By the end of the 1960s," we are told, "the discontent remained, but much 
of the opportunity for experimentation vanished. Students began to knuckle down 
for grades and eschewed political activities that might get them thrown out of 
school; dropouts, no longer able to live off the scraps of a booming economy, 
were forced to look for work and face the problems of any other workers. The 
romantic exuberence and sense of possibility that marked the 1960s became a 
matter of history."</p>

<p class="fst">This shallow treatment of what is happening today among students 
and dropouts could easily be culled from Time and Life articles on the demise of 
the sixties. I would hate to explode Jeremy's illusions, but the majority of 
students even in the sixties were always looking for good grades and "eschewed 
political activity that might get them thrown out of school." As to the radical 
minority of students who fomented most of the activity on the campuses, the 
"romantic exuberence and sense of possibility" they created was built on a 
suicidal, arrogant polarization politics that, in turn, was based on the myth 
that the "revolution" was a year or two away. That the majority of students did 
not fall for this political insanity is much to their credit. That many radical 
students have now returned to school to do some serious thinking about the role 
of campuses, education, and theory generally after a career of guilting students 
with the sickening insult that "students are shit" is also creditable. What the 
seventies have learned from the "radical" politics of the sixties is that the 
revolution is not around the corner with each trashing of an ROTC building and 
that some serious theory had better be learned&#8212;whether on campuses or off 
them&#8212;to deal with the decades-long development that lies ahead. What should be 
regarded as a very important aspect of a larger development, one which opens new 
potentialities for the future, is treated by Jeremy as the demise of a period 
and development he never understood in the first place.</p>

<p class="fst">As to dropout youth, I would remind Jeremy that the 
counterculture as a whole has been a much more complex development than he cares 
to think. Having lived it to a large extent, I can remember when it survived 
during the mid-sixties on a diet of candy bars (literally!) in two small urban 
enclaves (N.Y.'s Lower Eastside and San Francisco's Haight district), when it 
shared a rabidly anti-technological outlook, and when it lived in an ambience of 
apolitical adolescent irresponsibility. Since them, I've seen it spread all over 
the country, graduate from candy bars to organic foods and farming, turn from 
political indifference to almost impatient political action, replace its 
anti-technological attitude by a serious ecotechnological one, learn skills that 
would have amazed its middle-class progenitors, increasingly acquire a new sense 
of responsibility, maturity, and self-respect, and most importantly, raise 
problems of subjective relationships that far and away overshadow the anemic, 
economistic "class consciousness" fostered by the Marxian sects with such 
notable lack of success for over a half century among the proletariat. For once, 
these dropouts have posed the problems of self-management and self-activity so 
intrinsic to a communist consciousness not merely as issues of "management" and 
"activity" but of the new self that could make management and activity 
existentially and humanly meaningful. I have emphasized repeatedly that the 
forging of this new self that will be capable of self-management and 
self-activity occurs very unevenly and cannot be fully actualized under 
conditions of unfreedom. But to struggle for the development of this new self, 
and to attempt to raise the subjective issues it must deal with, are vitally 
important even in advance of the communist revolution we all seek&#8212;or else the 
revolution will never be a communist one. In raising the issues of a new self 
and in struggling to actualize it, the counterculture stands head and shoulders 
over the arid sects of the Marxian "left" whose "class consciousness" has never 
left the factory domain at best or the ballot box at worst. And I deeply resent 
their denunciatory attitude toward a development that they never anticipated, 
that they preyed on like vultures to fill the ranks of their demonstrations and 
cadres, and on whose presumed "grave" they now gleefully dance.</p>

<p class="fst">I'm not much concerned with whether Post-Scarcity Anarchism is a 
"product" or a dialectical superimposition "on a number of themes that were &#8216;in 
the air&#8217; during the 1960s" (as Jeremy puts it) or an anticipation of many of the 
counterculture's essential elements. I would simply remind Jeremy that I was 
writing on ecology, post-scarcity, and utopian problems of social reconstruction 
and decentralization in the early 1950s in Contemporary Issues, long before such 
"themes" were taken up by Galbraith, Reich, and Carson. The publication of my 
book, Our Synthetic Environment, which already deals with all the issues raised 
by "Ecology and Revolutionary Thought" precedes Silent Spring by half a year. 
What seriously concerns me is the fact that the student movement and the 
counterculture of the sixties fell on the Marxist sects (including the Council 
Communists) like a ton of bricks and left them completely bewildered. <i>Root and 
Branch</i> has not been around long enough for me to assess the degree to which it 
shares in the poverty of this attitude. But I feel it shares the economistic 
bias of most Marxian groups and what I have to say applies at least partly to it 
as to other Marxian groups.</p>

<p class="fst">The Marxists of the early sixties never expected white 
middle-class suburban kids, "overgorged" by "affluence," to do precisely what 
they had predicted workers would do owing to "immiseration" and "pauperization." 
And I'll be damned if they know what to do with it yet, all their 
re-interpretations of Marx's theory of alienation notwithstanding. Saddled with 
a perspective that was hot news in 1848, they were "prepared" for a growing 
unemployed reserve army, for the "relative" pauperization of the proletariat, 
for a "chronic economic crisis" (as we called it in the thirties), for an 
increasingly politicized and revolutionary proletariat, all of which was to 
culminate in a proletarian revolution. This is no mere "vulgarization" of 
Marxism; it formed the foundations of proletarian socialism, an epochal 
perspective that cannot be erased with incidental quotations from Marx's "early" 
or "middle" writings. With the sixties, the Marxists found not factory workers 
but rather moderately well-to-do "privileged" kids moving into rebellion on a 
wide cultural, humanistic, and even personalistic front against all aspects of 
the established system&#8212;not merely against class society but hierarchical 
society; not merely against economic exploitation, but domination in every form; 
not merely for happiness but for pleasure; not merely for "social justice" but 
for freedom on a multidimensional scale (women's liberation, sexual liberation, 
children's liberation, control from below in every phase of life, communal 
living, mutual aid, counterinstitutions to the existing ones, etc., as well as 
economic and social liberation.) Where Marxism had led its disciples to expect a 
social upheaval to stem primarily from the struggle of wage labor against 
capital motivated by the material immiseration of the proletariat, they found 
themselves face-to-face with a rebellious movement of "petty bourgeois" youth 
who had tasted of the "American Dream" and rejected it as odious. The truth must 
be stated: every Marxist group, to my knowledge, alternately castigated this 
movement, downgraded it with Olympian arrogance, later parasitized and divided 
it, and now is trying to bury it. First, the movement was condemned as "petty 
bourgeois hedonosm" or "middle-class escapism." When it began to get serious, it 
was arrogantly described as a "children's crusade" (to use Marcuse's memorable 
words). As it grew even more serious, it was characterized as "co-optable." At 
every point in its complex development, the movement was taken by Marxists for 
what it was at the given time and either condemned or shrugged off. But as 
"flower power" gave way to "student power," as "student power" gave way to 
"control over the streets," and as immense street demonstrations and campus 
uprisings began to shout "power to the people" and raise clenched fists, our 
beloved Marxists began to search into the sacred texts&#8212;to the "early writings" 
and "middle writings" of the Holy One&#8212;to ferret out a formula that would explain 
how it all happened. Today we are in the <i>Grundrisse</i> stage; yesterday, it was the 
1844 <i>Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts</i>; and if I read Jeremy's views 
accurately, tomorrow it will be the <i>Capital</i> stage.</p>

<p class="fst">Well, it's turning into a deathly bore. And with the latest 
developments in "praxis Marxism," into academic scholasticism&#8212;as the current 
Gramsci and Lukacs craze seems to indicate. The real issue between Jeremy and 
myself is that, in my view, none of these neo-Marxian or orthodox Marxian stages 
suffices&#8212;that we must transcend Marxism itself in Hegel's sense of aufhebung. 
This means that we must incorporate the best of Marx (as we have the best of 
Hegel and others)&#8212;and go further. My Post-Scarcity Anarchism makes a stab in 
this direction. People who are interested in following the same direction would 
do well to read the book itself without Jeremy's blinders. And I would ask that 
they read not only Post-Scarcity Anarchism but my essay "On Organization and 
Spontaneity" which appears in the current issue of <i>Anarchos</i> and my "Toward a 
Philosophy of Spirit" in a forthcoming issue of <i>Telos</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">For the rest, my dispute with Jeremy's review boils down to a 
host of logistical and administrative problems&#8212;incredibly, as though these 
problems could be discussed merely as matters of "management" without dealing 
with the changed self that must be hyphenated by the term. Accordingly, Jeremy 
gets involved in the preposterous problem of who would dump the garbage in Troy 
that people in Perth Amboy will drink. I would have expected this kind of 
"problem" from the laissez-faire "anarchists" of the Murray Rothbard school, but 
hardly from a Council Communist who professes to carry on the 
Organizationsgeists tradition of Anton Pannekoek.</p>

<p class="fst">I will not get into this kind of nonsense. Considering the level 
of this order of criticism, Jeremy will have to deal in his own mind with 
whether he has merely assimilated a structure from Pannekoek (i.e. a mechanism 
called "workers councils" which, if my memory serves me well, Pannekoek never 
regarded as the permanent form of a communist society) or the problem of 
geistige relations (which, in my view, represents Pannekoek's noblest 
contribution to communist theory.) It is the discussion of the latter problem&#8212;of 
communist subjectivity and relations&#8212;that I find so notably absent in Jeremy's 
review. And until this problem is seriously taken up in the full recognition 
that Pannekoek was one of the earliest Marxists to open it in the dismal history 
of European socialism, Jeremy and I are simply talking away from each other.</p>

<p class="fst">As to the details of Jeremy's review, I'd like to bring into 
question the polemical methods that seem to guide it. Jeremy is obviously out to 
establish that, as a "product" of the counterculture, I am a 
crypto-"naturalist," who would prefer to a lost Golden Age of isolated, 
self-sufficient autarchical communities. Only from this perspective can I 
explain the outright distortion in Jeremy's presentation of my views. He 
unerringly fails to note that when I speak of a "self-sufficient community" in 
"Ecology and Revolutionary Thought" (p. 80), I precede it with the adjective 
"relatively." Obviously, I mean more than autarchy when I use the adjective, but 
Jeremy is out to nail me as an "autarchist." Having committed this distortion, 
Jeremy proceeds to compound it by viewing my thesis in support of regional 
integration as something I "concede." You see, it is not that I believe in 
regional integration, but rather that I "concede" it is necessary. I must, alas, 
abide with it. Unless the reader goes beyond Jeremy's rather shady account, 
here, and reads <i>Post-Scarcity Anarchism</i>, she or he would never know that for 
several pages of my essay on "Toward a Liberatory Technology" I argue for 
regional integration and the need to interlink resources between ecocommunities. 
Jeremy's entire treatment of this area of discussion is tinged by a certain 
intellectual dishonesty. But Jeremy doesn't know when to stop. Having turned an 
argument for integration into a mere "concession," he proceeds still further to 
compound his distortion by inverting my very view of the relationship between 
work and technology to the point of utter absurdity. "Bookchin," he declares 
with a grand flourish, "takes his final dive into science fiction when he 
envisions &#8216;humans of the future&#8217; who simply forget about technology and &#8216;stand 
at the end of cybernated assembly line with baskets to cart the goods home." (p. 
133)</p>

<p class="fst">Now, this could be called the art of "selective quoting" that 
verges on lying in one's teeth. The reader of <i>Post-Scarcity Anarchism</i> who 
consults pp. 133-35 will find that "Bookchin," in fact, regards such a notion&#8212;so 
popular in many circles when the essay was written&#8212;is exactly what must be 
avoided, quite aside from whether it is possible or not, if the "fracture 
separating man from machine" is to be healed. "Bookchin" is arguing against the 
very mentality that yields this sort of "science fiction." Indeed, in the 
ensuing page "Bookchin" proceeds to argue as forcefully as he can that a 
balanced relationship must be established between work and the machine, and the 
machine must be assimilated to artistic craftsmanship.</p>

<p class="fst">Frankly, what am I to make of this kind of "misreading"? I 
don't want to think that Jeremy is a liar or a distorter&#8212;merely, that he reads 
what he wants to believe. This mode of "reading," in effect, is a mode of 
thinking. Were I to critically examine Jeremy's review line by line, I could 
demonstrate that far from overstating the possibilities at hand&#8212;technologically, 
culturally, and socially&#8212;I have understated them. The amount of material I have 
amassed on ecotechnologies alone since "Toward a Liberatory Technology" was 
written would boggle Jeremy's rather limited imagination. The fact is that 
Jeremy is singularly conservative&#8212;and this conservatism permeates his entire 
review. He takes things as they are&#8212;from the relations of Troy and Perth Amboy 
to the national division of labor&#8212;and merely adds a different structure 
("workers councils") to the established order of things. He sees no significant 
change in the self that is to achieve this different structure of 
self-management nor does he see any changes that people will make in their needs 
as they change themselves and society. Jeremy, in short, reasons like a 
bourgeois sociologist who has bought communism as a good ideological product but 
never assimilated it dialectically or permitted it to change his outlook toward 
life.</p>

<p class="fst">One could go on indefinitely unraveling the skein of hodgepodge 
criticism that Jeremy inflicts on <i>Post-Scarcity Anarchism</i>. I will not enter into 
Jeremy's attempt to dissolve ecological microenvironments into "worldwide" macroenvironments (surely Jeremy must know something about the ecosystem concept 
in ecology which stresses the need for a recognition of local uniqueness), nor 
will I deal with his silly analogy for the fascinating projections Jacob Rosin 
presents for molecular industrial chemistry. In my opinion, Jeremy just doesn't 
know what he is talking about. His observations on classical Athens and the work 
"citizen" are also silly. I would have hoped that Jeremy understood the whole 
thrust of my argument: namely, that Athens must be understood not merely in 
terms of its social limitations (limitations which I would hope we all 
understood) but as a polis whose attainments were all the more remarkable 
inspite of its limitations. Jeremy's attempt to link my attitude toward the 
working class with that of the "end of ideology" people and Tom Hayden is as 
crude as the Lower East Side "revolutionary" scenario he seems to impute to me. 
As a person who has spent ten years in heavy industry as a shop steward and 
union activist, I don't need a sermon about my "moral contempt" for the 
proletariat. Having acquired my knowledge of the proletariat from shops rather 
than university libraries, I know workers to be neither inferior nor superior to 
any other dominated section of the population. In addressing myself to the 
dubious "privileges" of the middle classes, I was not trying to say that they 
were more oppressed than workers but that both classes were now being oppressed 
in new ways and in a new social context.</p>

<p class="fst">Another point is worth clarifying. My pamphlet "<a href="../1969/listen-marxist.htm">Listen, Marxist!</a>" 
(of which some 40,000 copies have been published in separate printings and in 
anthologies) was the first sixties work that, to my knowledge, posed and 
predicted the changes that would occur in young workers' attitudes toward the 
work ethic and hierarchy. I did not suck this viewpoint from my thumb. It came 
from a personal knowledge of traditional working class attitudes toward work and 
hierarchy, and from a knowledge of the impact that the counterculture was having 
on present-day working class youth. Now that this prediction is being harvested 
in real life, I find it rather amusing that this view is being ripped off 
(without acknowledgement, of course) by many Marxists as evidence of an 
"upsurge" by "new" working class "types." I would be quite disturbed, however, 
to find that this viewpoint is used to re-establish the archaic cult of 
ouvrierisme and to vitiate the impact of the counterculture as a social force. 
There are signs that this is occurring. Let me make it clear, however, that I am 
not leveling this accusation against Jeremy; in fact, I wish I could. For Jeremy 
there seems to be no problem about the proletariat's psyche inasmuch as the 
issue hardly exists for him. Apparently, little has changed among workers since 
the 1860s, when Marx wrote Capital&#8212;merely that they have become more or less 
"class conscious" during different periods of history.</p>

<p class="fst">As to Marx's writings on the Paris Commune as evidence of his 
attitude toward a "proletarian dictatorship," the less said, the better. It is a 
notorious fact that Marx's <i>Civil War in France</i>, from which Marxists cull the 
most libertarian conceptions of the "proletarian dictatorship," was a 
"theoretical lapse" (shall we say an "anarchist deviation"?) which he 
"rectified" with very snide remarks about the Commune and the Communards in the 
last years of his life. (For a comprehensive discussion of this "theoretical 
lapse," see Ron Suny's <i>The Baku Commune</i>, which I think was published by 
Princeton University Press a year or two ago.) Marx's comments on the state in 
the <i>Critique of the Gotha Program</i> are much too spotty to be taken as definitive 
statements of his views. For reasons I explain in "<a href="../1969/listen-marxist.htm">Listen, Marxist!</a>" Marx was 
essentially a centralist and more often than not modeled his views of a 
post-revolutionary period on the Jacobin dictatorship&#8212;that is, in moments when 
he did not concede that socialism in England and America (Engels later added 
France and might just as well have added Germany) could be introduced by 
parliamentary means. The truth is that Marx's views were guided by the 
"opportunity" at hand: preferably a Jacobin-type dictatorship in his more 
revolutionary moments, a Commune-type "state" between 1871-75, and when he 
conceived it possible, a socialist republic led by a workers' party and based on 
a nationalized economy.</p>

<p class="fst">But all of this is secondary to what concerns me even more 
deeply&#8212;the mentality that permeates Jeremy's review. Marx, owing to his attempt 
to produce a "scientific" socialism, at once devalued and denatured the 
libertarian and imaginative elements of early European socialism. Martin Buber 
discusses this regressive development with considerable insight and sensitivity 
in his Paths in Utopia. But at least Marx and Engels retained the high tradition 
of Hegelian thought and the French utopists in their vision of communism. One 
can still find in Engels' <i>Anti-Dühring</i>, for all its shortcomings, the concept of 
the rounded individual in a rounded society, based on decentralized communities 
and on a transcendence of the contradiction between town and country, mental and 
physical work, and humanity and nature. Engels does not accept urban life, the 
national division of labor, and the industrial structure as it is. He radically 
challenges the entire ensemble&#8212;not, like Jeremy, offers cutsy modifications that 
will "improve" things once workers' councils take over. Engels retains the love 
of the polis-type society that so profoundly influenced Hegel and German 
classical philosophy. One senses in <i>Anti-Dühring</i> the influence of the best in 
Hellenism and Fourierism, the desire for a new sensibility and for new geistige 
relations between human beings.</p>

<p class="fst">In the years following the death of Marx and Engels, we have seen 
the emergence of a new type of "Marxist": one whose outlook is operational 
rather than speculative, sociological (and "socialist") rather than communist, 
structural rather than dialectical, intellectually colorless rather than 
imaginative. I'm sorry to say that the thinking of this type of "Marxist" is 
typified by Jeremy's review. Perhaps the kindest name I can give it is 
"assembly-line socialism." Jeremy, to tell the truth, writes like a social 
engineer. He is basically concerned not with self-management but with 
"management," and workers councils happen to be the most democratic way of 
"administering" the what-is. He raises virtually every mediocre argument that 
one could expect from a street heckler or a bourgeois sociologist&#8212;and the two 
are merely the opposite sides of the same "commonsensical" coin. Who will clean 
up the garbage? Who will do the dirty work? Won't "self-sufficient communities" 
behave like parochial small towns in Indiana? Won't people be greedy? How will 
the majority be prevented from oppressing the minority. Won't Peoria try to 
oppress Oshkosh by withholding materials from it&#8212;or whatever ad nauseum? It 
matters little that Jeremy raises all of these questions as such, but this is 
the way he thinks.</p>

<p class="fst">I find this mentality all the more disquieting when it appears in 
a comrade and a friend who is likely to invoke the name of Anton Pannekoek as a 
teacher. It is only recently in an article by Russell Jacoby (see <i>Telos</i> No. 10, 
Winter 1971) that I learned how earnestly Pannekoek had occupied himself as far 
back as 1912 with the geistige nature of the proletariat and its 
organizations&#8212;how he attempted to uproot bourgeois subjectivity not only from 
the socialist movement but from the working class as a whole. As one who feels 
closer to the Council Communists than any other organized group in the Marxist 
movement, I would even more earnestly ask them to explore the emergence of the 
geistige issue as it appears today&#8212;to advance the work which Pannekoek began 
into their own era, not to denature it with an economistic sensibility. We have 
had enough of this sensibility in the dismal seventy years that have poisoned 
European socialism and led to so many tragic defeats. The work Geist (Spirit) is 
a good one. As a comrade and friend, I would hope that it is taken seriously by 
the <i>Root and Branch</i> people with due respect to the memory of Pannekoek as well 
as to the issues he raised.</p>
