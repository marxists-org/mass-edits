<hr>

<p class="fst">On March 1, 1921, the Kronstadt naval base on Kotlin Island, some 
twenty-five miles offshore from Petrograd adopted a fifteen-point program of 
political and economic demands &#8211; a program in open defiance of the Bolshevik Party&#700;s control of the Soviet state.</p>

<p class="fst">Almost immediately the Bolsheviks denounced the uprising as a 
&#8220;White Guard plot,&#8221; ostensibly another the series of counterrevolutionary 
conspiracies that had beleaguered the Soviet regime during the three preceding 
years of civil war. Less than three weeks later, on March 17, Kronstadt was 
subdued in a bloody assault by select Red Army units. The Kronstadt uprising, to 
all appearances, had been little more than a passing episode in the bitter 
history of the civil war.</p>

<p class="fst">We can now say, however, that the Kronstadt uprising marked the 
definitive end of the Russian Revolution itself. Indeed, the character and 
importance of the uprising were destined to become issues of acrimonious dispute 
within the international Left for years to come. Today, although an entirely new 
generation of revolutionaries has emerged &#8211; a generation almost totally 
uninformed of the events &#8220;the problem of Kronstadt&#8221; has lost none of its 
relevance and poignancy. For the Kronstadt uprising posed very far-reaching 
issues: the relationship between the so-called &#8220;masses&#8221; and the parties which 
profess to speak in their name, and the nature of the social system in the 
modern Soviet Union. The Kronstadt uprising, in effect, remains as a lasting 
challenge to the Bolshevik concept of a party&#700;s historical function and the 
notion of the Soviet Union as a &#8220;workers&#8221; or &#8220;socialist&#8221; state.</p>

<p class="fst">The Kronstadt sailors were no ordinary military body. They were 
the famous &#8220;Red Sailors&#8221; of 1905, 1917, and the civil war. By common consent 
(until the Bolsheviks began to revise history after the uprising) the Kronstadt 
sailors were regarded as the most reliable and politicised military elements of 
the newly established Soviet regime. Trotsky&#700;s feeble attempt in later years to 
debase their reputation by alluding to &#8220;new&#8221; social strata (presumably 
&#8220;peasants&#8221;) that had replaced the &#8220;original&#8221; Red Sailors (presumably &#8220;workers&#8221;) 
in Kronstadt during the civil war is beneath contempt. Whether &#8220;peasants&#8221; or 
&#8220;workers&#8221; &#8211; and both existed in varying numbers in the naval base &#8211; Kronstadt 
had long been the furnace of the revolution. Its living traditions and its close 
contact with &#8220;Red Petrograd&#8221; served to anneal men of nearly all strata into 
revolutionaries.</p>

<p class="fst">In fact, Kronstadt had risen as a result of a strike movement in 
Petrograd, a near uprising by the Petrograd proletariat. It cannot be emphasized 
too strongly that the demands of the Kronstadt sailors were not formulated in 
the fastness of an isolated island in the Gulf of Finland: they were developed 
as a result of the close contact between the naval base and the restless 
Petrograd workers, whose demands the fifteen-point program essentially 
articulated. As Isaac Deutscher was obliged to acknowledge, the Bolshevik 
denunciations of the Kronstadt uprising as a &#8220;White Guard plot&#8221; were simply 
groundless.</p>

<p class="fst">What were these demands? Ida Mett discusses them in detail in <a href="../../mett/1938/kronstadt.htm">her 
book</a>. A glance shows that the political demands centered around soviet 
democracy: new elections to the soviets, freedom of speech for Anarchists and 
Left Socialist parties, free trade unions and peasant organizations, the 
liberation of Anarchist and Socialist political prisoners. Economic and 
institutional demands focused on a loosening of the stringent trade restrictions 
imposed by the period of &#8220;War Communism.&#8221; The demands of the Kronstadt sailors 
were the very minimum needed to rescue the revolution from bureaucratic decay 
and economic strangulation.</p>

<p class="fst">Ordinarily, there are two histories of revolutions. The first 
comprises the official history, a history which turns around the conflicts of 
parties, factions, and &#8220;leaders.&#8221; The other, in the words of the Russian 
Anarchist, Volíne, may be called the &#8220;unknown revolution&#8221; &#8211; the rarely written 
accounts of independent, creative action by the revolutionary people. Marxian 
accounts, to a surprising extent, fall into the official form of historiography: 
popular aspects of the revolution are often distorted to accord with a 
predetermined social framework. The workers invariably have their assigned 
historical &#8220;role&#8221;; the peasants a &#8220;role&#8221; of their own; the intellectuals and 
Party, still other &#8220;roles.&#8221; The vital, often decisive activity of so-called 
&#8220;transitional classes,&#8221; such as workers of peasant origin or <i>déclassé</i> 
elements, are usually ignored. Owing to its simplistic mauling of social 
reality, this type of historiography leaves many crucial aspects of past and 
present-day revolutions completely unexplained.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
Events acquire an academic form that is pieced together by programs, ideological 
clashes, and, of course, the ubiquitous &#8220;leaders.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">In the Kronstadt uprising, the &#8220;masses&#8221; had the effrontery to 
enter the historic stage again, as they did in February and October, four years 
earlier. In fact, the uprising marked the culmination and the end of the popular 
movement in the Russian Revolution &#8211; a movement the Bolshevik party basically 
mistrusted and shamelessly manipulated. The overthrow of Czarism in February, 
1917 &#8211; a spontaneous revolution in which none of the Socialist parties and 
factions played a significant role &#8211; opened the way to a sweeping popular 
movement. Having shattered centuries-old institutions in a matter of days, the 
workers and peasants began <i>on their own initiative</i> to create new, 
entirely revolutionary social forms. Historical accounts of the revolution 
rarely tell us that in the cities, the most significant of these were not the 
soviets but rather the factory committees: bodies of workers established and 
controlled by workers&#8221; assemblies in the shops. In the villages, what has 
usually been designated as &#8220;soviets&#8221; more closely corresponded to local 
committees of peasants, based on popular assemblies. In both cases, the 
committees were truly <i>organic</i> social bodies, wedded to direct, 
face-to-face democratic forms. By contrast, the regional soviets were 
essentially parliamentary bodies, structured as indirect or so-called 
&#8220;representative&#8221; political hierarchies. These culminated in remote national 
congresses of soviets, controlled by a select executive committee.</p>

<p class="fst">The social history of the Revolution turned around the fate of 
the factory committees and village assemblies, not simply around conflicting 
armies and duels between the Bolsheviks and their political opponents. The 
factory committees demanded and, for a brief period, acquired full control over 
industrial operations. Lenin distrusted them completely after October. As early 
as January, 1919, only two months after &#8220;decreeing&#8221; workers&#700; control of the 
factories, the Bolshevik leader moved into open opposition to the committees. In 
Lenin&#700;s view, the revolution demanded &#8220;precisely in the interests of socialism 
that the masses <i>unquestionably obey the single will</i> of the leaders of the 
labour process.&#8221; The committees were thereupon increasingly divested of any 
function in industrial operations their powers were transferred to the trade 
union and finally the powers of the unions delivered almost entirely to state 
appointed managers. Workers control was sharply denounced not only as 
&#8220;inefficient&#8221;, &#8220;chaotic&#8221;, and &#8220;impractical&#8221; but as &#8220;petit-bourgeois&#8221; 
and as &#8220;anarcho-syndicalist deviation.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">In the countryside, Bolshevik policy was marked by a distrust of 
cooperatives and communes &#8211; and by expanding the use of forced requisitions of 
food. As I have indicated elsewhere, to Lenin the preferred, more &#8220;socialist&#8221; 
form of agricultural enterprise was represented by the State Farm literally, an 
agricultural factory in which the state owned the land and farming equipment, 
appointing managers who hire peasants on a wage basis.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> 
By 1920, the Bolsheviks had isolated themselves completely from the working 
class an peasantry, a fact which Lenin openly acknowledged. Eve: the soviets had 
been hollowed into a political shell, divested of all content. Political life, 
public expression, and popular activity had come to a standstill; the Cheka, a 
secret police established under Dzerzhinsky, herded revolutionary oppositionists 
into jails and concentration camps. In increa8i&#8221; numbers, the more articulate 
spokesmen of independent soviet parties and groups were shot merely for the 
expression of dissident views. The policies formulated under the rubric of &#8220;War 
Communism&#8221; created near famine conditions in the cities by blocking virtually 
all exchange between town and country and by imposing more demanding 
requisitions upon the peasantry. The workers and peasants may have won the civil 
war, but this much is certain: they had lost the revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">Only in this political and economic context can we understand the 
strikes that swept Petrograd in February, 1921, and the uprising of the 
Kronstadt sailors. From Kronstadt the cry went up for a &#8220;Third Revolution of the 
toilers,&#8221; not a counterrevolution to restore the past. By crushing the uprising, 
the Bolsheviks succeeded not only in blocking a third revolution, but in paving 
the way for the Stalinist regime. Later, history was to take its own savage 
revenge: many of the Bolsheviks who had played a role in putting down Kronstadt 
were to pay with their lives In the bloody purges of the thirties.</p>

<p class="fst">The main value of Ida Mett&#700;s work is the glimpse it gives us into 
the popular movement, a movement on which depends the outcome of all 
revolutionary upheavals. We are drawn away from the Party and soviet congresses, 
from the &#8220;leaders&#8221; and the political factions, into the very soul of the 
revolutionary process. We gain a sense of the political insights evolved in the 
streets and barracks; we are brought into the molecular processes of the 
movement below; we establish contact with the remarkable spirit of popular 
improvisation, the enthusiasm and energy, that marks the revolutionary people in 
motion. For these reasons alone Mett&#700;s short work deserves the closest reading, 
for what is at stake in her account of Kronstadt is not the Russian Revolution 
alone, but the very concept of revolution itself.</p>

<p class="fst">The Bolshevik party did not &#8220;make&#8221; the Russian Revolution; it <i>
dominated</i> the revolution and thereby strangled it. It played no role 
whatever in February, 1917, when Czarism was overthrown; in October, eight 
months later, the party took power for itself, not on behalf of the Soviets or 
the factory committees. Doubtless, conscious revolutionary organizations were 
necessary in 1917, or, at least, active groups of revolutionaries. The real 
issue, however, was whether these revolutionary groups were capable of 
dissolving into the social forms created by the revolutionary people (be they 
factory committees or Soviets) or whether they turned into a separate power over 
these social forms, manipulation and finally destroying them. The Bolshevik 
party was constitutionally incapable of taking the first direction; its 
hierarchical, centralized structure, not to speak of the mentality of its 
leaders, had simply converted the party into a mirror image of the bourgeois 
state apparatus it claimed to overthrow.</p>

<p class="fst">During the debates that were to determine the fate of the factory 
committees, the Left Communist, Ossinsky warned his party: &#8220;Socialism and 
socialist organization mum he set up by the proletariat itself, or they will not 
be set up at all; something else will be set up &#8211; state capitalism.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The warning, delivered in the early days of the revolution, was 
prophetic. It would he an utter absurdity to claim that a state apparatus which 
divests the workers or any control over society can be regarded as a &#8220;workers&#700; 
state.&#8221; Actually, until 1917, all the major factions of the Russian Marxist 
movement believed that Russia was face with a bourgeois revolution. Aside from 
organizations considerations, the disagreements between the Bolsheviks and 
Mensheviks centred primarily around the <i>political</i> role of the workers and 
peasants in the coming upheaval. By demanding a &#8220;democratic dictatorship of the 
proletariat and peasantry,&#8221; the Bolsheviks were essentially calling for a 
politically dominant role by the oppressed. The Mensheviks, in turn, adhered 
essentially to the view that Russia required a democratic, parliamentary 
republic, governed by bourgeois parties. Neither of the two social-democratic 
factions were so naive as to believe that backward, agrarian Russia was prepared 
for a &#8220;proletarian dictatorship,&#8221; much less for socialism.</p>

<p class="fst">The success of the February Revolution, however, caused Lenin to 
veer toward a &#8220;proletarian dictatorship, a position spelled out in the famous 
slogan: &#8220;All power to the soviets!&#8221; Significant as this shift may have been, it 
was not rooted in any conviction on Lenin&#700;s part that Russia was suddenly 
prepared for a &#8220;workers&#700; state.&#8221; Quite to the contrary: Lenin viewed a 
&#8220;proletarian revolution&#8221; in Russia primarily as a stimulus to socialist 
revolutions in the industrialised, war-torn countries of the West, notably 
Germany. To Lenin, the war had opened the prospect of revolutions abroad &#8211; 
revolutions that could be ignited by a &#8220;proletarian revolution&#8221; in Russia. At no 
point did he deceive himself that a &#8220;workers&#700; state&#8221; or &#8220;socialism&#8221; could be 
established within the confines of a predominantly peasant country.</p>

<p class="fst">The defeat of the Spartakus uprising in Berlin in January, 1919, 
left the Russian Revolution completely isolated. Despite the Marxian jargon of 
the new Soviet regime, despite its red flags and the obvious hostility of the 
traditional ruling classes at home and abroad, the fact remains that the 
revolution increasingly fell back to a bourgeois level, for it was inconceivable 
that an isolated, economically backward country, besieged by political enemies 
on every side, could advance beyond capitalist social relations.</p>

<p class="fst">But what type of capitalist social relations were created by the 
October Revolution? This was to remain a very knotty question. The revolution 
had eliminated the traditional Russian bourgeoisie and many of its political 
institutions. It had nationalized the land and all of industry, an unprecedented 
act in the modern history of Europe. Later, the Soviet regime was to institute 
&#8220;planned production.&#8221; All of these changes in the early decades of the twentieth 
century were regarded as incompatible with capitalism, although Engels in 
<i>Anti-Dühring</i> had toyed with the theoretical possibility that they could occur 
within a bourgeois framework.</p>

<p class="fst">The problems created by the October Revolution were further 
complicated by the terminology of the Bolsheviks themselves. Lenin had variously 
described the Soviet state as &#8220;state capitalist&#8221;, &#8220;a workers&#700; state,&#8221; and 
&#8220;peasants&#700; state with bureaucratic deformations,&#8221; to he followed by Trotsky&#700;s 
nonsensical description of the Stalinist dictatorship as &#8220;degenerated workers&#700; 
state.&#8221; Lenin also complicated the problem by crudely describing socialism as 
&#8220;nothing but a state capitalist monopoly <i>made to benefit the whole people</i>.&#8221; 
Thus, in the early years of the Soviet regime, it was difficult not only to find 
parallels for state capitalism in any existing capitalist country, but to 
distinguish it from &#8220;socialism.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Today, after a half century of capitalist development we occupy a 
better vantage point. We can see that, excel for the few months when the factory 
committees controlled Industry, the Russian Revolution had by no means 
transcended a bourgeois social and economic framework. Commodity production and 
economic exploitation were destined to he as prevalent after the October 
Revolution as before. The workers and peasants were to be denied control over 
Soviet society as surely as they had been denied over Czarist society. We also 
know that nationalization of industry and planned production are perfectly 
compatible with bourgeois social relations. The historic trend of industrial 
capitalism has always been in the direction of the centralization capital, the 
development of monopoly, the merging Industry with the state, economic planning, 
and finally the increasing power of a bureaucratic apparatus over economic and 
political life.</p>

<p class="fst">Ironically, Trotsky might have understood how this trend 
developed in Russia had he simply followed through his own concept of &#8220;combined 
development&#8221; to its logic conclusion. He saw (quite correctly) that Czarist 
Russia, latecomer in the European bourgeois development, necessarily acquired 
the most advanced industrial and class forms, instead of recapitulating the 
entire bourgeois development from its beginnings. He neglected to consider that 
Russia torn by a tremendous internal upheaval which dispossessed the <i>
traditional</i> bourgeois and land-owning classes, might have thereby <i>run 
ahead</i> of the capitalist development elsewhere in the world &#8211; certainly, 
after the workers and peasants were dispossessed of their control over the 
factories and land by the new bureaucracy. Hypnotized by the preposterous 
formula, &#8220;nationalized property is antithetical to capitalism,&#8221; Trotsky failed 
to recognize that monopoly capitalism itself <i>tends to amalgamate with the 
state by its own inner dialectic, that involves the concentration of capital 
into fewer and fewer enterprises</i>. Lenin&#700;s analogy between &#8220;socialism&#8221; and 
state capitalism thus became a terrifying reality under Stalin &#8211; a form of state 
capitalism that does not &#8220;benefit the whole people.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Fundamentally, the source of the confusion concerning the 
&#8220;nature&#8221; of the social system in Russia &#8211; the famous &#8220;Russian question&#8221; 
&#8211; lay in 
the incompleteness of the Marxian economic analysis. Writing in the 
mid-nineteenth century, Marx was familiar only with two phases of the capitalist 
development: mercantilism and &#8220;laissez-faire&#8221; industrial capitalism. Although <i>
Capital</i> brilliantly delineates the emergence of industrial from mercantile 
capitalism, the discussion ends precisely where it must begin for us a century 
later. We can see that the concentration of capital advances into still another 
phase: the <i>statification</i> of capital. The &#8220;free market&#8221; passes into a 
monopolistic and finally a state-manipulated market. The &#8220;anarchy of 
production&#8221; (to use Engels&#700; phrase) passes into the managed, &#8220;planned&#8221; economy, 
a system of planning designed not only to avert economic crises but to promote 
capital accumulation. Capitalism follows through its dialectic in almost 
classical Hegelian terms: from the state-controlled economy initiated by 
mercantilism into the &#8220;free market&#8221; established by industrial capitalism and 
back again to neo-mercantilist forms, but on the new level created by 
technological and industrial growth. Marx could not be expected to follow this 
dialectic to its conclusion a century ago; for us to ignore it, a century later, 
would he theoretical myopia of the worst possible kind.</p>

<p class="fst">The development toward state capitalism appears as a <i>tendency</i> 
in the West primarily because early economic and political forms still exercise 
a powerful influence upon social institutions. Although waning rapidly, the 
notions of the &#8220;free market&#8221; and the &#8220;sovereign individual&#8221; continue to pervade 
economic relations in Europe and America. In Russia and many areas of the &#8220;Third 
World,&#8221; however, state capitalism assumes a complete form because revolution 
rupture the present from the past, leading to the destruction of the older 
ruling classes and institutions. &#8220;Socialism)&#8221; in its accepted Marxian form tends 
to become ideology in the narrowest sense of the term precisely because, as 
Lenin observed, so much of Marxian socialism can be identified with state 
capitalism. Marx&#700;s acceptance of the state &#8211; the &#8220;proletarian dictatorship,&#8221; the 
&#8220;socialist state&#8221; &#8211; becomes the vehicle for transmuting the great socialist 
vision into a totally reactionary spectacle: the red flags which drape the 
coffin of the popular revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">What might have happened had Kronstadt succeeded? We certainly 
would have been spared a Stalinist development, a development which turned the 
entire world Communist movement into an instrument of international 
counter-revolution. In the end, it was not only Russia that suffered brutally, 
but humanity as a whole. The legacy left to us by Bolshevism in the forms of 
Stalinism, Trotskyism, and Maoism, has burdened revolutionary thought and praxis 
as much as the betrayals of the reformist wings of the socialist movement.</p>

<p class="fst">A victory by the Kronstadt sailors might have also opened a new 
perspective for Russia &#8211; a hybrid social development combining workers&#700; control 
of factories with an open market in agricultural goods, based on a small-scale 
peasant economy and voluntary agrarian communes. Certainly, such a society in 
backward agrarian Russia could not have stabilized itself for very long without 
outside aid; but aid might have been forthcoming had the revolutionary movement 
of Europe and Asia developed freely, without interference from the Third 
International. Stalinism foreclosed this possibility completely. By the late 
twenties, virtually all sections of the Communist International had become 
instruments of Stalinist policy, to be marketed in exchange for diplomatic and 
military alliances with the capitalist powers.</p>

<p class="fst">The suppression of Kronstadt in March 1921, was an act of 
outright counterrevolution, the throttling of the popular movement at a time 
when Lenin, Trotsky, and other outstanding Bolsheviks stood at the helm of the 
Soviet regime. To speak as Trotsky does, of the &#8220;continuity&#8221; of the Russian 
Revolution into the thirties, to describe the bureaucracy as the guardian of the 
victories of October, to call Stalinism merely a &#8220;Thermidorean&#8221; reaction 
&#8211; all 
of this is sheer nonsense. There is neither continuity nor Thermidor; merely the 
window dressing for a vision that was throttled in 1921 and even earlier. 
Stalin&#700;s accession to power merely underscored a counterrevolution that had 
begun earlier. Long before 1927, when the Trotskyist opposition was expelled, 
all the social gains had been erased so far as the Russian people were 
concerned. Hence the indifference of the workers and peasants to the 
anti-Stalinist opposition movements within the Communist Party.</p>

<p class="fst">All the conditions for Stalinism were prepared by the defeat of 
the Kronstadt sailors and Petrograd strikers. We may choose to lament these 
popular movements, to honour the heroism of the victims, to inscribe their 
efforts in the annals of the revolution. But above all the Kronstadt revolt and 
the strike movement in Petrograd must be understood &#8211; as we would understand the 
lessons of all the great revolutions &#8211; if we are to grasp the content of the 
revolutionary process itself.</p>
