<h2><a name="h1">Preface</a></h2>

<p class="fst">These essays are less an analysis of the Spanish Revolution and 
Civil War of 1936-39 than an evocation of the greatest proletarian and peasant 
revolution to occur over the past two centuries. Although they contain a general 
overview and evaluation of the Anarchist and Anarchosyndicalist movements (the 
two should be clearly distinguished) in the three-year struggle at the end of 
the 1930s, they are not intended to be a full account of those complex events.</p>

<p class="fst">It is no exaggeration to say that the Spanish Revolution was the 
farthest-reaching movement that the Left ever produced, for reasons the essays 
that follow will make clear. The Spanish proletariat and peasantry, led largely 
by Anarchist militants whose names will never be known to us, strained the 
limits of what we in the 1930s called "proletarian socialism" and went 
appreciably beyond them. Far more than the leaders of the Anarchosyndicalist 
National Confederation of Labor and the Iberian Anarchist Federation (CNT-FAI) 
expected or apparently even wanted, Anarchists and Anarchosyndicalists 
spontaneously formed the famous industrial and agrarian collectives that so 
markedly distinguished the Spanish Revolution from any that had preceded it. 
They provided the militiamen and women who died by the thousands in the early 
fighting against the Francoist generals who led the military uprising of July 
1936 in behalf of the Spanish landlords, the industrial bourgeoisie, and the 
Church.</p>

<p class="fst">The endeavors of the Anarchists and their Left Socialist allies 
in the Spanish Revolution must never be forgotten, lest today's Left lose a 
sense of continuity with the revolutionary era&#8212;its idealism, principles, and 
ideas. The loss of this continuity would contribute to political opportunism and 
to a fashionable ideological pluralism that mingles reformist politics with 
radical rhetoric as the need arises.</p>

<p class="fst">The essays that follow attempt to reach a wider readership than 
do the more academic studies of the events. The first essay, retitled here "An 
Overview of the Spanish Libertarian Movement," consists of my September 1973 
introductory essay to Sam Dolgoff's <i>The Anarchist Collectives: Workers' 
Self-Management in the Spanish Revolution 1936-1939</i> (New York: Free Life 
Editions, 1974), which was more of a compendium of excerpts than a comprehensive 
work in its own right. The second essay, "After Fifty Years: The Spanish Civil 
War," published in <i>New Politics</i>, n.s., vol. 1, no. 1 (Summer 1986), was 
written to commemorate the half-century anniversary of the Spanish 
Revolution.<a href="#r1" name="rn1" target="_self">[1*]</a> I wish to thank my friends Phyllis and Julius Jacobson, the 
editors of <i>New Politics</i>, for their kind permission to reprint the essay 
here.</p>

<p class="fst">I dedicate this book to the CNT-FAI revolutionaries Gastón Leval 
and José Peirats&#8212;two astonishingly honest and committed comrades.</p>
