<h3><a name="h1">[Prologue]</a></h3>

<p class="fst">All the old crap of the thirties is coming back again&#8212;the shit 
about the "class line," the "role of the working class," the "trained cadres," 
the "vanguard party," and the "proletarian dictatorship." It's all back again, 
and in a more vulgarized form than ever. The Progressive Labor Party is not the 
only example, it is merely the worst. One smells the same shit in various 
offshoots of SDS, and in the Marxist and Socialist clubs on campuses, not to 
speak of the Trotskyist groups, the International Socialist Clubs, and Youth 
Against War and Fascism.</p>

<p class="fst">In the thirties, at least it was understandable. The United 
States was paralyzed by a chronic economic crisis, the deepest and longest in 
its history. The only living forces that seemed to be battering at the walls of 
capitalism were the great organizing drives of the CIO, with their dramatic 
sit-down strikes, their radical militancy, and their bloody clashes with the 
police. The political atmosphere throughout the entire world was charged by the 
electricity of the Spanish Civil War, the last of the classical workers' 
revolutions, when every radical sect in the American left could identify with 
its own militia columns in Madrid and Barcelona. That was thirty years ago. It 
was a time when anyone who cried out "Make love, not war" would have been 
regarded as a freak; the cry then was "Make jobs, not war"&#8212;the cry of an age 
burdened by scarcity, when the achievement of socialism entailed "sacrifices" 
and a "transition period" to an economy of material abundance. To an 
eighteen-year-old kid in 1937 the very concept of cybernation would have seemed 
like the wildest science fiction, a fantasy comparable to visions of space 
travel. That eighteen-year-old kid has now reached fifty years of age, and his 
roots are planted in an era so remote as to differ <i>qualitatively</i> from the 
realities of the present period in the United States. Capitalism itself has 
changed since then, taking on increasingly statified forms that could be 
anticipated only dimly thirty years ago. And now we are being asked to go back 
to the "class line," the "strategies," the "cadres" and the organizational forms 
of that distant period in almost blatant disregard of the new issues and 
possibilities that have emerged.</p>

<p class="fst">When the hell are we finally going to create a movement that 
looks to the future instead of to the past? When will we begin to learn from 
what is being born instead of what is dying? Marx, to his lasting credit, tried 
to do that in his own day; he tried to evoke a futuristic spirit in the 
revolutionary movement of the 1840s and 1850s. "The tradition of all the dead 
generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living," he wrote in <i>
The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</i>.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"And just when they seem to be engaged in revolutionizing 
themselves and things, in creating something entirely new, precisely in such 
epochs of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past 
to their service and borrow from them names, battle slogans and costumes in 
order to present the new scene of world history in this time-honored disguise 
and borrowed language. Thus Luther donned the mask of the Apostle Paul, the 
revolution of 1789 to 1814 draped itself alternately as the Roman Republic and 
the Roman Empire, and the revolution of 1848 knew nothing better than to parody, 
in turn, 1789 and the tradition of 1793 to 1795. ... The social revolution of 
the nineteenth century cannot draw its poetry from the past, but only from the 
future. It cannot begin with itself before it has stripped off all superstition 
in regard to the past. ... In order to arrive at its content, the revolution of 
the nineteenth century must let the dead bury their dead. There the phrase went 
beyond the content; here the content goes beyond the phrase."<a h
ref="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Is the problem any different today, as we approach the 
twenty-first century? Once again the dead are walking in our midst&#8212;ironically, 
draped in the name of Marx, the man who tried to bury the dead of the nineteenth 
century. So the revolution of our own day can do nothing better than parody, in 
turn, the October Revolution of 1917 and the civil war of 1918-1920, with its 
"class line," its Bolshevik Party, its "proletarian dictatorship," its 
puritanical morality, and even its slogan, "soviet power." The complete, 
all-sided revolution of our own day that can finally resolve the historic 
"social question," born of scarcity, domination and hierarchy, follows the 
tradition of the partial, the incomplete, the one-sided revolutions of the past, 
which merely changed the form of the "social question," replacing one system of 
domination and hierarchy by another. At a time when bourgeois society itself is 
in the process of disintegrating all the social classes that once gave it 
stability, we hear the hollow demands for a "class line." At a time when all the 
political institutions of hierarchical society are entering a period of profound 
decay, we hear the hollow demands for a "political party" and a "workers' 
state." At a time when hierarchy as such is being brought into question, we hear 
the hollow demands for "cadres," "vanguards" and "leaders." At a time when 
centralization and the state have been brought to the most explosive point of 
historical negativity, we hear the hollow demands for a "centralized movement" 
and a "proletarian dictatorship."</p>

<p class="fst">This pursuit of security in the past, this attempt to find a 
haven in a fixed dogma and an organizational hierarchy as substitutes for 
creative thought and praxis is bitter evidence of how little many 
revolutionaries are capable of "revolutionizing themselves and things," much 
less of revolutionizing society as a whole. The deep-rooted conservatism of the 
PLP<a href="#r1" name="rn1" target="_self">[1*]</a> "revolutionaries" is almost painfully evident; the authoritarian leader 
and hierarchy replace the patriarch and the school bureaucracy; the discipline 
of the Movement replaces the discipline of bourgeois society; the authoritarian 
code of political obedience replaces the state; the credo of "proletarian 
morality" replaces the mores of puritanism and the work ethic. The old substance 
of exploitative society reappears in new forms, draped in a red flag, decorated 
by portraits of Mao (or Castro or Che) and adorned with the little "Red Book" 
and other sacred litanies.</p>

<p class="fst">The majority of the people who remain in the PLP today deserve 
it. If they can live with a movement that cynically dubs its own slogans into 
photographs of DRUM pickets;<a href="#r2" name="rn2" target="_self">[2*]</a> if they can read a magazine that asks whether 
Marcuse is a "copout or cop"; if they can accept a "discipline" that reduces 
them to poker-faced, programmed automata; if they can use the most disgusting 
techniques (techniques borrowed from the cesspool of bourgeois business 
operations and parliamentarianism) to manipulate other organizations; if they 
can parasitize virtually every action and situation merely to promote the growth 
of their party&#8212;even if this means defeat for the action itself&#8212;then they are 
beneath contempt. For these people to call themselves reds and describe attacks 
upon them as red-baiting is a form of McCarthyism in reverse. To rephrase 
Trotsky's juicy description of Stalinism, they are the syphilis of the radical 
youth movement today. And for syphilis there is only one treatment&#8212;an 
antibiotic, not an argument.</p>

<p class="fst">Our concern here is with those honest revolutionaries who have 
turned to Marxism, Leninism or Trotskyism because they earnestly seek a coherent 
social outlook and an effective strategy of revolution. We are also concerned 
with those who are awed by the theoretical repertory of Marxist ideology and are 
disposed to flirt with it in the absence of more systematic alternatives. To 
these people we address ourselves as brothers and sisters and ask for a serious 
discussion and a comprehensive re-evaluation. We believe that Marxism has ceased 
to be applicable to our time not because it is too visionary or revolutionary, 
but because it is not visionary or revolutionary enough. We believe it was born 
of an era of scarcity and presented a brilliant critique of that era, 
specifically of industrial capitalism, and that a new era is in birth which 
Marxism does not adequately encompass and whose outlines it only partially and 
one-sidedly anticipated. We argue that the problem is not to "abandon" Marxism 
or to "annul" it, but to transcend it dialectically, just as Marx transcended 
Hegelian philosophy, Ricardian economics, and Blanquist tactics and modes of 
organization. We shall argue that in a more advanced stage of capitalism than 
Marx dealt with a century ago, and in a more advanced stage of technological 
development than Marx could have clearly anticipated, a new critique is 
necessary, which in turn yields new modes of struggle, of organization, of 
propaganda and of lifestyle. Call these new modes whatever you will, even 
"Marxism" if you wish. We have chosen to call this new approach post-scarcity 
anarchism, for a number of compelling reasons which will become evident in the 
pages that follow.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">The Historical Limits of Marxism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The idea that a man whose greatest theoretical contributions were 
made between 1840 and 1880 could "foresee" the entire dialectic of capitalism 
is, on the face of it, utterly preposterous. If we can still learn much from 
Marx's insights, we can learn even more from the unavoidable errors of a man who 
was limited by an era of material scarcity and a technology that barely involved 
the use of electric power. We can learn how different our own era is from that 
of <i>all</i> past history, how qualitatively new are the potentialities that 
confront us, how unique are the issues, analyses and praxis that stand before us 
if we are to make a revolution and not another historical abortion.</p>

<p class="fst">The problem is not that Marxism is a "method" which must be 
reapplied to "new situations" or that "neo-Marxism" has to be developed to 
overcome the limitations of "classical Marxism." The attempt to rescue the 
Marxian pedigree by emphasizing the method over the system or by adding "neo" to 
a sacred word is sheer mystification if all the <i>practical</i> conclusions of 
the system flatly contradict these efforts.<a href="#r3" name="rn3" target="_self">[3*]</a> Yet this is precisely the state 
of affairs in Marxian exegesis today. Marxists lean on the fact that the system 
provides a brilliant interpretation of the past while willfully ignoring its 
utterly misleading features in dealing with the present and future. They cite 
the coherence that historical materialism and the class analysis give to the 
interpretation of history, the economic insights of <i>Capital</i> provides into 
the development of industrial capitalism, and the brilliance of Marx's analysis 
of earlier revolutions and the tactical conclusions he established, without once 
recognizing that qualitatively new problems have arisen which never existed in 
his day. Is it conceivable that historical problems and methods of class 
analysis based entirely on unavoidable scarcity can be transplanted into a new 
era of potential abundance? Is it conceivable that an economic analysis focused 
primarily on a "freely competitive" system of industrial capitalism can be 
transferred to a managed system of capitalism, where state and monopolies 
combine to manipulate economic life? Is it conceivable that a strategic and 
tactical repertory formulated in a period when coal and steel constituted the 
basis of industrial technology can be transferred to an age based on radically 
new sources of energy, on electronics, on cybernation?</p>

<p class="fst">As a result of this transfer, a theoretical corpus which was 
liberating a century ago is turned into a straitjacket today. We are asked to 
focus on the working class as the "agent" of revolutionary change at a time when 
capitalism visibly antagonizes and produces revolutionaries among virtually all 
strata of society, particularly the young. We are asked to guide our tactical 
methods by the vision of a "chronic economic crisis" despite the fact that no 
such crisis has been in the offing for thirty years.<a href="#r4" name="rn4" target="_self">[4*]</a> We are asked to accept 
a "proletarian dictatorship"&#8212;a long "transitional period" whose function is not 
merely the suppression of counter-revolutionaries but above all the development 
of a technology of abundance&#8212;at a time when a technology of abundance is at 
hand. We are asked to orient our "strategies" and "tactics" around poverty and 
material immiseration at a time when revolutionary sentiment is being generated 
by the banality of life under conditions of material abundance. We are asked to 
establish political parties, centralized organizations, "revolutionary" 
hierarchies and elites, and a new state at a time when political institutions as 
such are decaying and when centralization, elitism and the state are being 
brought into question on a scale that has never occurred before in the history 
of hierarchical society.</p>

<p class="fst">We are asked, in short, to return to the past, to diminish 
instead of grow, to force the throbbing reality of our times, with its hopes and 
promises, into the deadening preconceptions of an outlived age. We are asked to 
operate with principles that have been transcended not only theoretically but by 
the very development of society itself. History has not stood still since Marx, 
Engels, Lenin and Trotsky died, nor has it followed the simplistic direction 
which was charted out by thinkers&#8212;however brilliant&#8212;whose minds were still 
rooted in the nineteenth century or in the opening years of the twentieth. We 
have seen capitalism itself perform many of the tasks (including the development 
of a technology of abundance) which were regarded as socialist; we have seen it 
"nationalize" property, merging the economy with the state wherever necessary. 
We have seen the working class neutralized as the "agent of revolutionary 
change," albeit still struggling within a <i>bourgeois</i> framework for more 
wages, shorter hours and "fringe" benefits. The class struggle in the <i>
classical</i> sense has not disappeared; it has suffered a more deadening fate 
by being co-opted into capitalism. The revolutionary struggle within the 
advanced capitalist countries has shifted to a historically new terrain: it has 
become a struggle between a generation of youth that has known no chronic 
economic crisis and the culture, values and institutions of an older, 
conservative generation whose perspective on life has been shaped by scarcity, 
guilt, renunciation, the work ethic and the pursuit of material security. Our 
enemies are not only the visibly entrenched bourgeoisie and the state apparatus 
but also an outlook which finds its support among liberals, social democrats, 
the minions of a corrupt mass media, the "revolutionary" parties of the past, 
and, painful as it may be to the acolytes of Marxism, the worker dominated by 
the factory hierarchy, by the industrial routine, and by the work ethic. The 
point is that the divisions now cut across virtually all the traditional class 
lines and they raise a spectrum of problems that none of the Marxists, leaning 
on analogies with scarcity societies, could foresee.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">The Myth of the Proletariat</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Let us cast aside all the ideological debris of the past and cut 
to the theoretical roots of the problem. For our age, Marx's greatest 
contribution to revolutionary thought is his dialectic of social development. 
Marx laid bare the great movement from primitive communism through private 
property to communism in its higher form&#8212;a communal society resting on a 
liberatory technology. In this movement, according to Marx, man passes on from 
the domination of man by nature, to the domination of man by man, and finally to 
the domination of nature by man<a href="#r5" name="rn5" target="_self">[5*]</a> and from social domination as such. Within 
this larger dialectic, Marx examines the dialectic of capitalism itself&#8212;a social 
system which constitutes the last historical "stage" in the domination of man by 
man. Here, Marx makes not only profound contributions to contemporary 
revolutionary thought (particularly in his brilliant analysis of the commodity 
relationship) but also exhibits those limitations of time and place that play so 
confining a role in our own time.</p>

<p class="fst">The most serious of these limitations emerges from Marx's attempt 
to explain the transition from capitalism to socialism, from a class society to 
a classless society. It is vitally important to emphasize that this explanation 
was reasoned out almost entirely by analogy with the transition of feudalism to 
capitalism&#8212;that is, <i>from one class society to another class society</i>, from 
one system of property to another. Accordingly, Marx points out that just as the 
bourgeoisie developed within feudalism as a result of the split between town and 
country (more precisely, between crafts and agriculture), so the modern 
proletariat developed within capitalism as a result of the advance of industrial 
technology. Both classes, we are told, develop social interests of their 
own&#8212;indeed, revolutionary social interests that throw them against the old 
society in which they were spawned. If the bourgeoisie gained control over 
economic life long before it overthrew feudal society, the proletariat, in turn, 
gains its own revolutionary power by the fact that it is "disciplined, united, 
organized" by the factory system.<a href="#r6" name="rn6" target="_self">[6*]</a> In both cases, the development of the 
productive forces becomes incompatible with the traditional system of social 
relations. "The integument is burst asunder." The old society is replaced by the 
new. The critical question we face is this: can we explain the transition from a 
class society to a classless society by means of the same dialectic that 
accounts for the transition of one class society to another? This is not a 
textbook problem that involves the juggling of logical abstractions but a very 
real and concrete issue for our time. There are profound differences between the 
development of the bourgeoisie under feudalism and the development of the 
proletariat under capitalism which Marx either failed to anticipate or never 
faced clearly. The bourgeoisie controlled economic life long before it took 
state power; it had become the dominant class materially, culturally and 
ideologically before it asserted its dominance politically. The proletariat does 
not control economic life. Despite its indispensable role in the industrial 
process, the industrial working class is not even a majority of the population, 
and its strategic economic position is being eroded by cybernation and other 
technological advances.<a href="#r7" name="rn7" target="_self">[7*]</a> Hence it requires an act of high consciousness for 
the proletariat to use its power to achieve a social revolution. Until now, the 
achievement of this consciousness has been blocked by the fact that the factory 
milieu is one of the most well-entrenched arenas of the work ethic, of 
hierarchical systems of management, of obedience to leaders, and in recent times 
of production committed to superfluous commodities and armaments. The factory 
serves not only to "discipline," "unite," and "organize" the workers, but also 
to do so in a thoroughly bourgeois fashion. In the factory, capitalistic 
production not only renews the social relations of capitalism with each working 
day, as Marx observed, it also renews the psyche, values and ideology of 
capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">Marx sensed this fact sufficiently to look for reasons more 
compelling than the mere fact of exploitation or conflicts over wages and hours 
to propel the proletariat into revolutionary action. In his general theory of 
capitalist accumulation he tried to delineate the harsh, objective laws that 
force the proletariat to assume a revolutionary role. Accordingly he developed 
his famous theory of immiseration: competition between capitalists compels them 
to undercut each others' prices, which in turn leads to a continual reduction of 
wages and the absolute impoverishment of the workers. The proletariat is 
compelled to revolt because with the process of competition and the 
centralization of capital there "grows the mass of misery, oppression, slavery, 
degradation."<a href="#r8" name="rn8" target="_self">[8*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But capitalism has not stood still since Marx's day. Writing in 
the middle years of the nineteenth century, Marx could not be expected to grasp 
the full consequences of his insights into the centralization of capital and the 
development of technology. He could not be expected to foresee that capitalism 
would develop not only from mercantilism into the dominant industrial form of 
his day&#8212;from state-aided trading monopolies into highly competitive industrial 
units&#8212;but further, that with the centralization of capital, capitalism returns 
to its mercantilist origins on a higher level of development and reassumes the 
state-aided monopolistic form. The economy tends to merge with the state and 
capitalism begins to "plan" its development instead of leaving it exclusively to 
the interplay of competition and market forces. To be sure, the system does not 
abolish the traditional class struggle, but manages to contain it, using its 
immense technological resources to assimilate the most strategic sections of the 
working class.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus the full thrust of the immiseration theory is blunted and in 
the United States the traditional class struggle fails to develop into the class 
war. It remains entirely within bourgeois dimensions. Marxism, in fact, becomes 
ideology. It is assimilated by the most advanced forms of the state capitalist 
movement&#8212;notably Russia. By an incredible irony of history, Marxian "socialism" 
turns out to be in large part the very state capitalism that Marx failed to 
anticipate in the dialectic of capitalism.<a href="#r9" name="rn9" target="_self">[9*]</a> The proletariat, instead of 
developing into a revolutionary class within the womb of capitalism, turns out 
to be an organ within the body of bourgeois society.</p>

<p class="fst">The question we must ask at this late date in history is whether 
a social revolution that seeks to achieve a classless society can emerge from a 
conflict between traditional classes in a class society, or whether such a 
social revolution can only emerge from the decomposition of the traditional 
classes, indeed from the emergence of an entirely new "class" <i>whose very 
essence is that it is a non-class</i>, a growing stratum of revolutionaries. In 
trying to answer this question, we can learn more by returning to the broader 
dialectic which Marx developed for human society as a whole than from the model 
he borrowed from the passage of feudal into capitalist society. Just as 
primitive kinship clans began to differentiate into classes, so in our own day 
there is a tendency for classes to decompose into entirely new subcultures which 
bear a resemblance to non-capitalist forms of relationships. These are not 
strictly economic groups any more; in fact, they reflect the tendency of the 
social development to transcend the economic categories of scarcity society. 
They constitute, in effect, a crude, ambiguous <i>cultural</i> preformation of 
the movement of scarcity into post-scarcity society.</p>

<p class="fst">The process of class decomposition must be understood in all its 
dimensions. The word "process" must be emphasized here: the traditional classes 
do not disappear, nor for that matter does the class struggle. Only a social 
revolution could remove the prevailing class structure and the conflicts it 
engenders. The point is the traditional class struggle ceases to have 
revolutionary implications; it reveals itself as the physiology of the 
prevailing society, not as the labor pains of birth. In fact the traditional 
class struggle stabilizes capitalist society by "correcting" its abuses (in 
wages, hours, inflation, employment, etc.). The unions in capitalist society 
constitute themselves into a counter-"monopoly" to the industrial monopolies and 
are incorporated into the neo-mercantile statified economy as an estate. Within 
this estate there are lesser or greater conflicts, but taken as a whole the 
unions strengthen the system and serve to perpetuate it.</p>

<p class="fst">To reinforce this class structure by babbling about the "role of 
the working class," to reinforce the traditional class struggle by imputing a 
"revolutionary" content to it, to infect the new revolutionary movement of our 
time with "workerists" is <i>reactionary to the core</i>. How often do the 
Marxian doctrinaires have to be reminded that the history of the class struggle 
is the history of a disease, of the wounds opened by the famous "social 
question," of man's one-sided development in trying to gain control over nature 
by dominating his fellow man? If the byproduct of this disease has been 
technological advance, the main products have been repression, a horrible 
shedding of human blood, and a terrifying distortion of the human psyche.</p>

<p class="fst">As the disease approaches its end, as the wounds begin to heal in 
their deepest recesses, the process now unfolds toward wholeness; the <i>
revolutionary</i> implications of the traditional class struggle lose their 
meaning as theoretical constructs and as social reality. The process of 
decomposition embraces not only the traditional class structure but also the 
patriarchal family, authoritarian modes of upbringing, the influence of 
religion, the institutions of the state, and the mores built around toil, 
renunciation, guilt and repressed sexuality. <i>The process of disintegration</i>, <i>
in short</i>, <i>now becomes generalized and cuts across virtually all the 
traditional classes</i>, <i>values and institutions</i>. <i>It creates entirely 
new issues</i>, <i>modes of struggle and forms of organization and calls for an 
entirely new approach to theory and praxis</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">What does this mean concretely? Let us contrast two approaches, 
the Marxian and the revolutionary. The Marxian doctrinaire would have us 
approach the worker&#8212;or better, "enter" the factory&#8212;and proselytize him in 
"preference" to anyone else. The purpose?&#8212;to make the worker "class conscious." 
To cite the most neanderthal examples from the old left, one cuts one's hair, 
grooms oneself in conventional sports clothing, abandons pot for cigarettes and 
beer, dances conventionally, affects "rough" mannerisms, and develops a 
humorless, deadpan and pompous mien.<a href="#r10" name="rn10" target="_self">[10*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One becomes, in short, what the worker is at his most 
caricaturized worst: not a "petty bourgeois degenerate," to be sure, but a <i>
bourgeois</i> degenerate. One becomes an imitation of the worker insofar as the 
worker is an imitation of his masters. Beneath this metamorphosis of the student 
into the "worker" lies a vicious cynicism. One tries to use the discipline 
inculcated by the factory milieu to discipline the worker to the party milieu. 
One tries to use the worker's respect for the industrial hierarchy to wed the 
worker to the party hierarchy. This disgusting process, which if successful 
could lead only to the substitution of one hierarchy for another, is achieved by 
pretending to be concerned with the worker's economic day-to-day demands. Even 
Marxian theory is degraded to accord with this debased image of the worker. (See 
almost any copy of <i>Challenge - the National Enquirer</i> of the left. Nothing 
bores the worker more than this kind of literature.) In the end, the worker is 
shrewd enough to know that he will get better results in the day-to-day class 
struggle through his union bureaucracy than through a Marxian party bureaucracy. 
The forties revealed this so dramatically that within a year or two, with hardly 
any protest from the rank-and-file, unions succeeded in kicking out by the 
thousands "Marxians" who had done spade-work in the labor movement for more than 
a decade, even rising to the top leadership of the old CIO internationals.</p>

<p class="fst">The worker becomes a <i>revolutionary</i> not by becoming more of 
a worker but by undoing his "workerness." And in this he is not alone; the same 
applies to the farmer, the student, the clerk, the soldier, the bureaucrat, the 
professional&#8212;and the Marxist. The worker is no less a "bourgeois" than the 
farmer, student, clerk, soldier, bureaucrat, professional&#8212;and Marxist. His 
"workerness" is the <i>disease</i> he is suffering from, the social affliction 
telescoped to individual dimensions. Lenin understood this in <i>What Is to Be 
Done?</i> but he smuggled in the old hierarchy under a red flag and some 
revolutionary verbiage. The worker begins to become a revolutionary when he 
undoes his "workerness," when he comes to detest his class status here and now, 
when he begins to shed exactly those features which the Marxists most prize in 
him&#8212;his work ethic, his character-structure derived from industrial discipline, 
his respect for hierarchy, his obedience to leaders, his consumerism, his 
vestiges of puritanism. In this sense, the worker becomes a revolutionary to the 
degree that he sheds his class status and achieves an <i>un</i>-class 
consciousness. He degenerates&#8212;and he degenerates magnificently. What he is 
shedding are precisely those <i>class</i> shackles that bind him to <i>all</i> 
systems of domination. He abandons those <i>class</i> interests that enslave him 
to consumerism, suburbia, and a bookkeeping conception of life.<a href="#r11" name="rn11" target="_self">[11*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The most promising development in the factories today is the 
emergence of young workers who smoke pot, fuck off on their jobs, drift into and 
out of factories, grow long or longish hair, demand more leisure time rather 
than more pay, steal, harass all authority figures, go on wildcats, and turn on 
their fellow workers. Even more promising is the emergence of this human type in 
trade schools and high schools, the reservoir of the industrial working class to 
come. To the degree that workers, vocational students and high school students 
link their lifestyles to various aspects of the anarchic youth culture, to that 
degree will the proletariat be transformed from a force for the conservation of 
the established order into a force for revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">A qualitatively new situation emerges when man is faced with a 
transformation from a repressive class society, based on material scarcity, into 
a liberatory classless society, based on material abundance. From the 
decomposing traditional class structure a new human type is created in 
ever-increasing numbers: the <i>revolutionary</i>. This revolutionary begins to 
challenge not only the economic and political premises of hierarchical society, 
but hierarchy as such. He not only raises the need for social revolution but 
also tries to <i>live</i> in a revolutionary manner to the degree that this is 
possible in the existing society.<a href="#r12" name="rn12" target="_self">[12*]</a> He not only attacks the forms created by 
the legacy of domination, but also improvises new forms of liberation which take 
their poetry from the future.</p>

<p class="fst">This preparation for the future, this experimentation with 
liberatory post-scarcity forms of social relations, may be illusory if the 
future involves a substitution of one class society by another; it is 
indispensable, however, if the future involves a classless society built on the <i>
ruins</i> of a class society. What, then, will be the "agent" of revolutionary 
change? It will be literally the great majority of society, drawn from all the 
different traditional classes and fused into a common revolutionary force by the 
decomposition of the institutions, social forms, values and lifestyles of the 
prevailing class structure. Typically, its most advanced elements are the 
youth&#8212;a generation that has known no chronic economic crisis and that is 
becoming less and less oriented toward the myth of material security so 
widespread among the generation of the thirties.</p>

<p class="fst">If it is true that a social revolution cannot be achieved without 
the active or passive support of the workers, it is no less true that it cannot 
be achieved without the active or passive support of the farmers, technicians 
and professionals. Above all, a social revolution cannot be achieved without the 
support of the youth, from which the ruling class recruits its armed forces. If 
the ruling class retains its armed might, the revolution is lost <i>no matter 
how many workers rally to its support</i>. This has been vividly demonstrated 
not only by Spain in the thirties but by Hungary in the fifties and 
Czechoslovakia in the sixties. The revolution of today&#8212;by its very nature, 
indeed, by its <i>pursuit of wholeness</i>&#8212;wins not only the soldier and the 
worker, <i>but the very generation from which soldiers</i>, <i>workers</i>, <i>
technicians</i>, <i>farmers</i>, <i>scientists</i>, <i>professionals and even 
bureaucrats have been recruited</i>. Discarding the tactical handbooks of the 
past, the revolution of the future follows the path of least resistance, eating 
its way into the most susceptible areas of the population irrespective of their 
"class position." It is nourished by <i>all</i> the contradictions in bourgeois 
society, not simply by the contradictions of the 1860s and 1917. Hence it 
attracts all those who feel the burdens of exploitation, poverty, racism, 
imperialism and, yes, those whose lives are frustrated by consumerism, suburbia, 
the mass media, the family, school, the supermarket and the prevailing system of 
repressed sexuality. Here the form of the revolution becomes as total as its 
content-classless, propertyless, hierarchyless, and <i>wholly</i> liberating. To 
barge into this revolutionary development with the worn recipes of Marxism, to 
babble about a "class line" and the "role of the working class," amounts to a 
subversion of the present and the future by the past. To elaborate this 
deadening ideology by babbling about "cadres," a "vanguard party," "democratic 
centralism" and the "proletarian dictatorship" is sheer counterrevolution. It is 
to this matter of the "organizational question"&#8212;this vital contribution of 
Leninism to Marxism&#8212;that we must now direct some attention.</p>

<h3><a name="h4">The Myth of the Party</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Social revolutions are not made by parties, groups or cadres, 
they occur as a result of deep-seated historic forces and contradictions that 
activate large sections of the population. They occur not merely because the 
"masses" find the existing society intolerable (as Trotsky argued) but also 
because of the tension between the actual and the possible, between what-is and 
what-could-be. Abject misery alone does not produce revolutions; more often than 
not, it produces an aimless demoralization, or worse, a private, personalized 
struggle to survive.</p>

<p class="fst">The Russian Revolution of 1917 weighs on the brain of the living 
like a nightmare because it was largely the product of "intolerable conditions," 
of a devastating imperialistic war. Whatever dreams it had were virtually 
destroyed by an even bloodier civil war, by famine, and by treachery. What 
emerged from the revolution were the ruins not of an old society but of whatever 
hopes existed to achieve a new one. The Russian Revolution failed miserably; it 
replaced czarism by state capitalism.<a href="#r13" name="rn13" target="_self">[13*]</a> The Bolsheviks were the tragic 
victims of their own ideology and paid with their lives in great numbers during 
the purges of the thirties. To attempt to acquire any unique wisdom from this 
scarcity revolution is ridiculous. What we can learn from the revolutions of the 
past is what all revolutions have in common and their profound limitations 
compared with the enormous possibilities that are now open to us. The most 
striking feature of the past revolutions is that they began spontaneously. 
Whether one chooses to examine the opening phases of the French Revolution of 
1789, the revolutions of 1848, the Paris Commune, the 1905 revolution in Russia, 
the overthrow of the czar in 1917, the Hungarian revolution of 1956, or the 
French general strike of 1968, the opening stages are generally the same: a 
period of ferment explodes spontaneously into a mass upsurge. Whether the 
upsurge is successful or not depends on its resoluteness and on whether the 
troops go over to the people.</p>

<p class="fst">The "glorious party," when there is one, almost invariably lags 
behind the events. In February 1917 the Petrograd organization of the Bolsheviks 
opposed the calling of strikes precisely on the eve of the revolution which was 
destined to overthrow the czar. Fortunately, the workers ignored the Bolshevik 
"directives" and went on strike anyway. In the events which followed, no one was 
more surprised by the revolution than the "revolutionary" parties, including the 
Bolsheviks. As the Bolshevik leader Kayurov recalled:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Absolutely no guiding initiatives from the party were 
felt...the Petrograd committee had been arrested and the representative from the 
Central Committee, Comrade Shliapnikov, was unable to give any directives for 
the coming day."<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Perhaps this was fortunate. Before the Petrograd committee was 
arrested, its evaluation of the situation and its own role had been so dismal 
that, had the workers followed its guidance, it is doubtful that the revolution 
would have occurred when it did.</p>

<p class="fst">The same kind of story could be told of the upsurges which 
preceded 1917 and those which followed&#8212;to cite only the most recent, the student 
uprising and general strike in France during May-June 1968. There is a 
convenient tendency to forget that close to a dozen "tightly centralized" 
Bolshevik-type organizations existed in Paris at this time. It is rarely 
mentioned that virtually every one of these "vanguard" groups disdained the 
student uprising up to May 7, when the street fighting broke out in earnest. The 
Trotskyist Jeunesse Communiste Révolutionnaire was a notable exception&#8212;and it 
merely coasted along, essentially following the initiatives of the March 22nd 
Movement.<a href="#r14" name="rn14" target="_self">[14*]</a> Up to May 7 all the Maoist groups criticized the student uprising 
as peripheral and unimportant; the Trotskyist Fédération des Étudiants 
Révolutionnaires regarded it as "adventuristic" and tried to get the students to 
leave the barricades on May 10; the Communist Party, of course, played a 
completely treacherous role. Far from leading the popular movement, the Maoists 
and Trotskyists were its captives throughout. Ironically, most of these 
Bolshevik groups used manipulative techniques shamelessly in the Sorbonne 
student assembly in an effort to "control" it, introducing a disruptive 
atmosphere that demoralized the entire body. Finally, to complete the irony, all 
of these Bolshevik groups were to babble about the need for "centralized 
leadership" when the popular movement collapsed&#8212;a movement that occurred despite 
their "directives" and often in opposition to them.</p>

<p class="fst">Revolutions and uprisings worthy of any note not only have an 
initial phase that is magnificently anarchic <i>but also tend spontaneously to 
create their own forms of revolutionary self-management</i>. The Parisian 
sections of 1793-94 were the most remarkable forms of self-management to be 
created by any of the social revolutions in history.<a href="#r15" name="rn15" target="_self">[15*]</a> More familiar in form 
were the councils or "soviets" which the Petrograd workers established in 1905. 
Although less democratic than the sections, the councils were to reappear in a 
number of later revolutions. Still another form of revolutionary self-management 
were the factory committees which the anarchists established in the Spanish 
Revolution of 1936. Finally, the sections reappeared as student assemblies and 
action committees in the May-June uprising and general strike in Paris in 
1968.<a href="#r16" name="rn16" target="_self">[16*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">At this point we must ask what role the "revolutionary" party 
plays in all these developments. In the beginning, as we have seen, it tends to 
have an inhibitory function, not a "vanguard" role. Where it exercises 
influence, it tends to slow down the flow of events, not "coordinate" the 
revolutionary forces. This is not accidental. The party is structured along 
hierarchical lines <i>that reflect the very society it professes to oppose</i>. 
Despite its theoretical pretensions, it is a bourgeois organism, a miniature 
state, with an apparatus and a cadre whose function it is to <i>seize</i> power, 
not <i>dissolve</i> power. Rooted in the prerevolutionary period, it assimilates 
all the forms, techniques and mentality of bureaucracy. Its membership is 
schooled in obedience and in the preconceptions of a rigid dogma and is taught 
to revere the leadership. The party's leadership, in turn, is schooled in habits 
born of command, authority, manipulation and egomania. This situation is 
worsened when the party participates in parliamentary elections. In election 
campaigns, the vanguard party models itself completely on existing bourgeois 
forms and even acquires the paraphernalia of the electoral party. The situation 
assumes truly critical proportions when the party acquires large presses, costly 
headquarters and a large inventory of centrally controlled periodicals, and 
develops a paid "apparatus"&#8212;in short, a bureaucracy with vested material 
interests.</p>

<p class="fst">As the party expands, the distance between the leadership and the 
ranks invariably increases. Its leaders not only become "personages," they lose 
contact with the living situation below. The local groups, which know their own 
immediate situation better than any remote leader, are obliged to subordinate 
their insights to directives from above. The leadership, lacking any direct 
knowledge of local problems, responds sluggishly and prudently. Although it 
stakes out a claim to the "larger view," to greater "theoretical competence," 
the competence of the leadership tends to diminish as one ascends the hierarchy 
of command. The more one approaches the level where the real decisions are made, 
the more conservative is the nature of the decision-making process, the more 
bureaucratic and extraneous are the factors which come into play, the more 
considerations of prestige and retrenchment supplant creativity, imagination, 
and a disinterested dedication to revolutionary goals.</p>

<p class="fst">The party becomes less efficient from a revolutionary point of 
view the more it seeks efficiency by means of hierarchy, cadres and 
centralization. Although everyone marches in step, the orders are usually wrong, 
especially when events begin to move rapidly and take unexpected turns&#8212;as they 
do in all revolutions. The party is efficient in only one respect&#8212;in molding 
society in its own hierarchical image if the revolution is successful. It 
recreates bureaucracy, centralization and the state. It fosters the bureaucracy, 
centralization and the state. It fosters the very social conditions which 
justify this kind of society. Hence, instead of "withering away," the state 
controlled by the "glorious party" preserves the very conditions which 
"necessitate" the existence of a state&#8212;and a party to "guard" it.</p>

<p class="fst">On the other hand, this kind of party is extremely vulnerable in 
periods of repression. The bourgeoisie has only to grab its leadership to 
destroy virtually the entire movement. With its leaders in prison or in hiding, 
the party becomes paralyzed; the obedient membership has no one to obey and 
tends to flounder. Demoralization sets in rapidly. The party decomposes not only 
because of the repressive atmosphere but also because of its poverty of inner 
resources.</p>

<p class="fst">The foregoing account is not a series of hypothetical inferences, 
it is a composite sketch of all the mass Marxian parties of the past century&#8212;the 
Social Democrats, the Communists, and the Trotskyist party of Ceylon (the only 
mass party of its kind). To claim that these parties failed to take their 
Marxian principles seriously merely conceals another question: why did this 
failure happen in the first place? The fact is, these parties were co-opted into 
bourgeois society because they were structured along bourgeois lines. The germ 
of treachery existed in them from birth.</p>

<p class="fst">The Bolshevik Party was spared this fate between 1904 and 1917 
for only one reason: it was an illegal organization during most of the years 
leading up to the revolution. The party was continually being shattered and 
reconstituted, with the result that until it took power it never really hardened 
into a fully centralized, bureaucratic, hierarchical machine. Moreover, it was 
riddled by factions; the intensely factional atmosphere persisted throughout 
1917 into the civil war. Nevertheless, the Bolshevik leadership was ordinarily 
extremely conservative, a trait that Lenin had to fight throughout 1917&#8212;first in 
his efforts to reorient the Central Committee against the provisional government 
(the famous conflict over the "April Theses"), later in driving the Central 
Committee toward insurrection in October. In both cases he threatened to resign 
from the Central Committee and bring his views to "the lower ranks of the 
party."</p>

<p class="fst">In 1918, factional disputes over the issue of the Brest-Litovsk 
treaty became so serious that the Bolsheviks nearly split into two warring 
communist parties. Oppositional Bolshevik groups like the Democratic Centralists 
and the Workers' Opposition waged bitter struggles within the party throughout 
1919 and 1920, not to speak of oppositional movements that developed within the 
Red Army over Trotsky's propensity for centralization. The complete 
centralization of the Bolshevik Party&#8212;the achievement of "Leninist unity," as it 
was to be called later&#8212;did not occur until 1921, when Lenin succeeded in 
persuading the Tenth Party Congress to ban factions. By this time, most of the 
White Guards had been crushed and the foreign interventionists had withdrawn 
their troops from Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">It cannot be stressed too strongly that the Bolsheviks tended to 
centralize their party to the degree that they became isolated from the working 
class. This relationship has rarely been investigated in latter-day Leninist 
circles, although Lenin was honest enough to admit it. The story of the Russian 
Revolution is not merely the story of the Bolshevik Party and its supporters. 
Beneath the veneer of official events described by Soviet historians there was 
another, more basic, development&#8212;the spontaneous movement of the workers and 
revolutionary peasants, which later clashed sharply with the bureaucratic 
policies of the Bolsheviks. With the overthrow of the czar in February 1917, 
workers in virtually all the factories of Russia spontaneously established 
factory committees, staking out an increasing claim on industrial operations. In 
June 1917 an all-Russian conference of factory committees was held in Petrograd 
which called for the "organization of thorough control by labor over production 
and distribution." The demands of this conference are rarely mentioned in 
Leninist accounts of the Russian Revolution, despite the fact that the 
conference aligned itself with the Bolsheviks. Trotsky, who describes the 
factory committees as "the most direct and indubitable representation of the 
proletariat in the whole country," deals with them peripherally in his massive 
three-volume history of the revolution. Yet so important were these spontaneous 
organisms of self-management that Lenin, despairing of winning the Soviets in 
the summer of 1917, was prepared to jettison the slogan "All Power to the 
Soviets" for "All Power to the Factory Committees." This demand would have 
catapulted the Bolsheviks into a completely anarcho-syndicalist position, 
although it is doubtful that they would have remained there very long.</p>

<p class="fst">With the October Revolution, all the factory committees seized 
control of the plants, ousting the bourgeoisie and completely taking control of 
industry. In accepting the concept of workers' control, Lenin's famous decree of 
November 14, 1917, merely acknowledged an accomplished fact; the Bolsheviks 
dared not oppose the workers at this early date. But they began to whittle down 
the power of the factory committees. In January 1918, a scant two months after 
"decreeing" workers' control, Lenin began to advocate that the administration of 
the factories be placed under trade union control. The story that the Bolsheviks 
"patiently" experimented with workers' control, only to find it "inefficient" 
and "chaotic," is a myth. Their "patience" did not last more than a few weeks. 
Not only did Lenin oppose direct workers' control within a matter of weeks after 
the decree of November 14, even union control came to an end shortly after it 
had been established. By the summer of 1918, almost all of Russian industry had 
been placed under bourgeois forms of management. As Lenin put it, the 
"revolution demands ... precisely in the interests of socialism that the masses <i>
unquestionably obey the single will</i> of the leaders of the labor 
process."<a href="#r17" name="rn17" target="_self">[17*]</a> Thereafter, workers' control was denounced not only as 
"inefficient," "chaotic" and "impractical," but also as "petty bourgeois"!</p>

<p class="fst">The Left Communist Osinsky bitterly attacked all of these 
spurious claims and warned the party: "Socialism and socialist organization must 
be set up by the proletariat itself, or they will not be set up at all; 
something else will be set up&#8212;state capitalism."<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> In the "interests of 
socialism" the Bolshevik party elbowed the proletariat out of every domain it 
had conquered by its own efforts and initiative. The party did not coordinate 
the revolution or even lead it; it dominated it. First workers' control and 
later union control were replaced by an elaborate hierarchy as monstrous as any 
structure that existed in pre-revolutionary times. As later years were to 
demonstrate, Osinsky's prophecy became reality.</p>

<p class="fst">The problem of "who is to prevail"&#8212;the Bolsheviks or the Russian 
"masses"&#8212;was by no means limited to the factories. The issue reappeared in the 
countryside as well as the cities. A sweeping peasant war had buoyed up the 
movement of the workers. Contrary to official Leninist accounts, the agrarian 
upsurge was by no means limited to a redistribution of the land into private 
plots. In the Ukraine, peasants influenced by the anarchist militias of Nestor 
Makhno and guided by the communist maxim "From each according to his ability; to 
each according to his needs," established a multitude of rural communes. 
Elsewhere, in the north and in Soviet Asia, several thousand of these organisms 
were established, partly on the initiative of the Left Social Revolutionaries 
and in large measure as a result of traditional collectivist impulses which 
stemmed from the Russian village, the <i>mir</i>. It matters little whether 
these communes were numerous or embraced large numbers of peasants; the point is 
that they were authentic popular organisms, the nuclei of a moral and social 
spirit that ranged far above the dehumanizing values of bourgeois society.</p>

<p class="fst">The Bolsheviks frowned upon these organisms from the very 
beginning and eventually condemned them. To Lenin, the preferred, the more 
"socialist," form of agricultural enterprise was represented by the state 
farm&#8212;an agricultural factory in which the state owned the land and farming 
equipment, appointing managers who hired peasants on a wage basis. One sees in 
these <i>attitudes</i> toward workers' control and agricultural communes the 
essentially bourgeois spirit and mentality that permeated the Bolshevik Party&#8212;a 
spirit and mentality that emanated not only from its theories, but also from its 
corporate mode of organization. In December 1918 Lenin launched an attack 
against the communes on the pretext that peasants were being "forced" to enter 
them. Actually, little if any coercion was used to organize these communistic 
forms of self-management. As Robert G. Wesson, who studied the Soviet communes 
in detail, concludes: "Those who went into communes must have done so largely of 
their own volition."<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> The communes were not suppressed but their growth was 
discouraged until Stalin merged the entire development into the forced 
collectivization drives of the late twenties and early thirties.</p>

<p class="fst">By 1920 the Bolsheviks had isolated themselves from the Russian 
working class and peasantry. Taken together, the elimination of workers' 
control, the suppression of the Makhnovtsy, the restrictive political atmosphere 
in the country, the inflated bureaucracy and the crushing material poverty 
inherited from the civil war years generated a deep hostility toward Bolshevik 
rule. With the end of hostilities, a movement surged up from the depths of 
Russian society for a "third revolution"&#8212;not to restore the past, as the 
Bolsheviks claimed, but to realize the very goals of freedom, economic as well 
as political, that had rallied the masses around the Bolshevik program of 1917. 
The new movement found its most conscious form in the Petrograd proletariat and 
among the Kronstadt sailors. It also found expression in the party: the growth 
of anti-centralist and anarcho-syndicalist tendencies among the Bolsheviks 
reached a point where a bloc of oppositional groups, oriented toward these 
issues, gained 124 seats at a Moscow provincial conference as against 154 for 
supporters of the Central Committee.</p>

<p class="fst">On March 2, 1921, the "red sailors" of Kronstadt rose in open 
rebellion, raising the banner of a "Third Revolution of the Toilers." The 
Kronstadt program centered around demands for free elections to the Soviets, 
freedom of speech and press for the anarchists and the left socialist parties, 
free trade unions, and the liberation of all prisoners who belonged to socialist 
parties. The most shameless stories were fabricated by the Bolsheviks to account 
for this uprising, acknowledged in later years as brazen lies. The revolt was 
characterized as a "White Guard plot" despite the fact that the great majority 
of Communist Party members in Kronstadt joined the sailors&#8212;<i>precisely as 
Communists</i>&#8212;in denouncing the party leaders as betrayers of the October 
Revolution. As Robert Vincent Daniels observes in his study of Bolshevik 
oppositional movements:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Ordinary Communists were indeed so unreliable...that the 
government did not depend upon them either in the assault on Kronstadt itself or 
in keeping order in Petrograd, where Kronstadt's hopes for support chiefly 
rested. The main body of troops employed were Chekists and officer cadets from 
Red Army training schools. The final assault on Kronstadt was led by the top 
officialdom of the Communist Party&#8212;a large group of delegates to the Tenth Party 
Congress was rushed from Moscow for this purpose."<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">So weak was the regime internally that the elite had to do its own 
dirty work.</p>

<p class="fst">Even more significant than the Kronstadt revolt was the strike 
movement that developed among the Petrograd workers, a movement that sparked the 
uprising of the sailors. Leninist histories do not recount this critically 
important development. The first strikes broke out in the Troubotchny factory on 
February 23, 1921. Within a matter of days the movement swept one factory after 
another, until by February 28 the famous Putilov works&#8212;the "crucible of the 
Revolution"&#8212;went on strike. Not only were economic demands raised, the workers 
raised distinctly political ones, anticipating all the demands that were to be 
raised by the Kronstadt sailors a few days later. On February 24, the Bolsheviks 
declared a "state of siege" in Petrograd and arrested the strike leaders, 
suppressing the workers' demonstrations with officer cadets. The fact is, the 
Bolsheviks did not merely suppress a "sailors' mutiny"; they crushed the working 
class itself. It was at this point that Lenin demanded the banning of factions 
in the Russian Communist Party. Centralization of the party was now complete&#8212;and 
the way was paved for Stalin.</p>

<p class="fst">We have discussed these events in detail because they lead to a 
conclusion that the latest crop of Marxist-Leninists tend to avoid: the 
Bolshevik Party reached its maximum degree of centralization in Lenin's day <i>
not to achieve a revolution or suppress a White Guard counterrevolution</i>, <i>
but to effect a counterrevolution of its own against the very social forces it 
professed to represent</i>. Factions were prohibited and a monolithic party 
created not to prevent a "capitalist restoration" but to contain a mass movement 
of workers for soviet democracy and social freedom. The Lenin of 1921 stood 
opposed to the Lenin of 1917.</p>

<p class="fst">Thereafter, Lenin simply floundered. This man who above all 
sought to anchor the problems of his party in social contradictions found 
himself literally playing an organizational "numbers game" in a last-ditch 
attempt to arrest the very bureaucratization he had himself created. There is 
nothing more pathetic and tragic than Lenin's last years. Paralyzed by a 
simplistic body of Marxist formulas, he can think of no better countermeasures 
than organizational ones. He proposes the formation of the Workers' and 
Peasants' Inspection to correct bureaucratic deformations in the party and 
state&#8212;and this body falls under Stalin's control and becomes highly bureaucratic 
in its own right. Lenin then suggests that the size of the Workers' and 
Peasants' Inspection be reduced and that it be merged with the Control 
Commission. He advocates enlarging the Central Committee. Thus it rolls along: 
this body to be enlarged, that one to be merged with another, still a third to 
be modified or abolished. The strange ballet of organizational forms continues 
up to his very death, as though the problem could be resolved by organizational 
means. As Mosche Lewin, an obvious admirer of Lenin, admits, the Bolshevik 
leader "approached the problems of government more like a chief executive of a 
strictly 'elitist' turn of mind. He did not apply methods of social analysis to 
the government and was content to consider it purely in terms of organizational 
methods."<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">If it is true that in the bourgeois revolutions the "phrase went 
beyond the content," in the Bolshevik revolution the forms replaced the content. 
The Soviets replaced the workers and their factory committees, the party 
replaced the Soviets, the Central Committee replaced the Party, and the 
Political Bureau replaced the Central Committee. In short, means replaced ends. 
This incredible substitution of form for content is one of the most 
characteristic traits of Marxism-Leninism. In France during the May-June events, 
all the Bolshevik organizations were prepared to destroy the Sorbonne student 
assembly in order to increase their influence and membership. Their principal 
concern was not the revolution or the authentic social forms created by the 
students, but the growth of their own parties.</p>

<p class="fst">Only one force could have arrested the growth of bureaucracy in 
Russia: a social force. Had the Russian proletariat and peasantry succeeded in 
increasing the domain of self-management through the development of viable 
factory committees, rural communes and free Soviets, the history of the country 
might have taken a dramatically different turn. There can be no question that 
the failure of socialist revolutions in Europe after the First World War led to 
the isolation of the revolution in Russia. The material poverty of Russia, 
coupled with the pressure of the surrounding capitalist world, clearly militated 
against the development of a socialist or a consistently libertarian society. 
But by no means was it ordained that Russia had to develop along state 
capitalist lines; contrary to Lenin's and Trotsky's initial expectations, the 
revolution was defeated by internal forces, not by invasion of armies from 
abroad. Had the movement from below restored the initial achievements of the 
revolution in 1917, a multifaceted social structure might have developed, based 
on workers' control of industry, on a freely developing peasant economy in 
agriculture, and on a living interplay of ideas, programs and political 
movements. At the very least, Russia would not have been imprisoned in 
totalitarian chains and Stalinism would not have poisoned the world 
revolutionary movement, paving the way for fascism and the Second World War.</p>

<p class="fst">The development of the Bolshevik Party, however, precluded this 
development&#8212;Lenin's or Trotsky's "good intentions" notwithstanding. By 
destroying the power of the factory committees in industry and by crushing the 
Makhnovtsy, the Petrograd workers and the Kronstadt sailors, the Bolsheviks 
virtually guaranteed the triumph of the Russian bureaucracy over Russian 
society. The centralized party&#8212;a completely bourgeois institution&#8212;became the 
refuge of counterrevolution in its most sinister form. This was covert 
counterrevolution that draped itself in the red flag and the terminology of 
Marx. Ultimately, what the Bolsheviks suppressed in 1921 was not an "ideology" 
or a "White Guard conspiracy," but an <i>elemental struggle of the Russian 
people</i> to free themselves of their shackles and take control of their own 
destiny.<a href="#r18" name="rn18" target="_self">[18*]</a> For Russia, this meant the nightmare of Stalinist dictatorship; 
for the generation of the thirties it meant the horror of fascism and the 
treachery of the Communist parties in Europe and the United States.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">The Two Traditions</a></h3>

<p class="fst">It would be incredibly naive to suppose that Leninism was the 
product of a single man. The disease lies much deeper, not only in the 
limitations of Marxian theory but in the limitations of the social era that 
produced Marxism. If this is not clearly understood, we will remain as blind to 
the dialectic of events today as Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky were in their 
own day. For us this blindness will be all the more reprehensible because behind 
us lies a wealth of experience that these men lacked in developing their 
theories.</p>

<p class="fst">Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were centralists&#8212;not only 
politically, but socially and economically. They never denied this fact and 
their writings are studded with glowing encomiums to political, organizational 
and economic centralization. As early as March 1850, in the famous "Address of 
the Central Council to the Communist League," they call upon the workers to 
strive not only for "the single and indivisible German republic, but also strive 
in it for the most decisive centralization of power in the hands of the state 
authority." Lest the demand be taken lightly, it is repeated continually in the 
same paragraph, which concludes: "As in France in 1793, so today in Germany the 
carrying through of the strictest centralization is the task of the really 
revolutionary party."</p>

<p class="fst">The same theme reappears continually in later years. With the 
outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, for example, Marx writes to Engels:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The French need a thrashing. If the Prussians win, the 
centralization of state power will be useful for the centralization of the 
German working class."<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Marx and Engels, however, were not centralists because they 
believed in the virtues of centralism per se. Quite the contrary: both Marxism 
and anarchism have always agreed that a liberated, communist society entails 
sweeping decentralization, the dissolution of bureaucracy, the abolition of the 
state, and the breakup of the large cities." Abolition of the antithesis between 
town and country is not merely possible," notes Engels in <i>Anti-Dühring</i>. 
"It has become a direct necessity...the present poisoning of the air, water and 
land can be put to an end only by the fusion of town and country. ..." To Engels 
this involves a "uniform distribution of the population over the whole 
country"<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a>&#8212;in short, the physical decentralization of the cities.</p>

<p class="fst">The origins of Marxian centralism are in problems arising from 
the formation of the national state. Until well into the latter half of the 
nineteenth century, Germany and Italy were divided into a multitude of 
independent duchies, principalities and kingdoms. The consolidation of these 
geographic units into unified nations, Marx and Engels believed, was a <i>sine 
qua non</i> for the development of modern industry and capitalism. Their praise 
of centralism was engendered not by any centralistic mystique but by the events 
of the period in which they lived&#8212;the development of technology, trade, a 
unified working class, and the national state. Their concern on this score, in 
short, is with the emergence of capitalism, with the tasks of the bourgeois 
revolution in an era of unavoidable material scarcity. Marx's approach to a 
"proletarian revolution," on the other hand, is markedly different. He 
enthusiastically praises the Paris Commune as a "model to all the industrial 
centers of France." "This regime," he writes, "once established in Paris and the 
secondary centers, the old centralized government would in the provinces, too, 
have to give way to the <i>self-government of the producers</i>." (Emphasis 
added.) The unity of the nation, to be sure, would not disappear, and a central 
government would exist during the transition to communism, but its functions 
would be limited.</p>

<p class="fst">Our object is not to bandy about quotations from Marx and Engels 
but to emphasize how key tenets of Marxism&#8212;which are accepted so uncritically 
today&#8212;were in fact the product of an era that has long been transcended by the 
development of capitalism in the United States and Western Europe. In his day 
Marx was occupied not only with the problems of the "proletarian revolution" but 
also with the problems of the bourgeois revolution, particularly in Germany, 
Spain, Italy and Eastern Europe. He dealt with the problems of transition from 
capitalism to socialism in capitalist countries which had not advanced much 
beyond the coal-steel technology of the Industrial Revolution, and with the 
problems of transition from feudalism to capitalism in countries which had 
scarcely advanced much beyond handicrafts and the guild system. To state these 
concerns broadly, Marx was occupied above all with the <i>preconditions</i> of 
freedom (technological development, national unification, material abundance) 
rather than with the <i>conditions</i> of freedom (decentralization, the 
formation of communities, the human scale, direct democracy). His theories were 
still anchored in the realm of <i>survival</i>, not the realm of <i>life</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Once this is grasped it is possible to place Marx's theoretical 
legacy in meaningful perspective&#8212;to separate its rich contributions from its 
historically limited, indeed paralyzing, shackles on our own time. The Marxian 
dialectic, the many seminal insights provided by historical materialism, the 
superb critique of the commodity relationship, many elements of the economic 
theories, the theory of alienation, and above all the notion that freedom has 
material preconditions&#8212;these are lasting contributions to revolutionary thought.</p>

<p class="fst">By the same token, Marx's emphasis on the industrial proletariat 
as the "agent" of revolutionary change, his "class analysis" in explaining the 
transition from a class to a classless society, his concept of the proletarian 
dictatorship, his emphasis on centralism, his theory of capitalist development 
(which tends to jumble state capitalism with socialism), his advocacy of 
political action through electoral parties&#8212;these and many related concepts are 
false in the context of our time and were misleading, as we shall see, even in 
his own day. They emerge from the limitations of his vision&#8212;more properly, from 
the limitations of his time. They make sense only if one remembers that Marx 
regarded capitalism as historically progressive, as an indispensable stage to 
the development of socialism, and they have practical applicability only to a 
time when Germany in particular was confronted by bourgeois-democratic tasks and 
national unification. (We are not trying to say that Marx was correct in holding 
this approach, merely that the approach makes sense when viewed in its time and 
place.) Just as the Russian Revolution included a subterranean movement of the 
"masses" which conflicted with Bolshevism, so there is a subterranean movement 
in history which conflicts with all systems of authority. This movement has 
entered into our time under the name of "anarchism," although it has never been 
encompassed by a single ideology or body of sacred texts. Anarchism is a 
libidinal movement of humanity against coercion in any form, reaching back in 
time to the very emergence of propertied society, class rule and the state. From 
this period onward, the oppressed have resisted all forms that seek to imprison 
the spontaneous development of social order. Anarchism has surged to the 
foreground of the social arena in periods of major transition from one 
historical era to another. The decline of the ancient and feudal world witnessed 
the upsurge of mass movements, in some cases wildly Dionysian in character, that 
demanded an end to all systems of authority, privilege and coercion.</p>

<p class="fst">The anarchic movements of the past failed largely because 
material scarcity, a function of the low level of technology, vitiated an 
organic harmonization of human interests. Any society that could promise little 
more materially than equality of poverty invariably engendered deep-seated 
tendencies to restore a new system of privilege. In the absence of a technology 
that could appreciably reduce the working day, the need to work vitiated social 
institutions based on self-management. The Girondins of the French Revolution 
shrewdly recognized that they could use the working day against revolutionary 
Paris. To exclude radical elements from the sections, they tried to enact 
legislation which would end all assembly meetings before 10 p.m., the hour when 
Parisian workers returned from their jobs. Indeed, it was not only the 
manipulative techniques and the treachery of the "vanguard" organizations that 
brought the anarchic phases of past revolutions to an end, it was also the 
material limits of past eras. The "masses" were always compelled to return to a 
lifetime of toil and rarely were they free to establish organs of 
self-management that could last beyond the revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">Anarchists such as Bakunin and Kropotkin, however, were by no 
means wrong in criticizing Marx for his emphasis on centralism and his elitist 
notions of organization. Was centralism absolutely necessary for technological 
advances in the past? Was the nation-state indispensable to the expansion of 
commerce? Did the workers' movement benefit by the emergence of highly 
centralized economic enterprises and the "indivisible" state? We tend to accept 
these tenets of Marxism too uncritically, largely because capitalism developed 
within a centralized political arena. The anarchists of the last century warned 
that Marx's centralistic approach, insofar as it affected the events of the 
time, would so strengthen the bourgeoisie and the state apparatus that the 
overthrow of capitalism would be extremely difficult. The revolutionary party, 
by duplicating these centralistic, hierarchical features, would reproduce 
hierarchy and centralism in the post-revolutionary society.</p>

<p class="fst">Bakunin, Kropotkin and Malatesta were not so naive as to believe 
that anarchism could be established overnight. In imputing this notion to 
Bakunin, Marx and Engels willfully distorted the Russian anarchist's views. Nor 
did the anarchists of the last century believe that the abolition of the state 
involved "laying down arms" immediately after the revolution, to use Marx's 
obscurantist choice of terms, thoughtlessly repeated by Lenin in <i>State and 
Revolution</i>. Indeed, much that passes for "Marxism" in <i>State and 
Revolution</i> is pure anarchism&#8212;for example, the substitution of revolutionary 
militias for professional armed bodies and the substitution of organs of 
self-management for parliamentary bodies. What is authentically Marxist in 
Lenin's pamphlet is the demand for "strict centralism," the acceptance of a 
"new" bureaucracy, and the identification of soviets with a state.</p>

<p class="fst">The anarchists of the last century were deeply preoccupied with 
the question of achieving industrialization without crushing the revolutionary 
spirit of the "masses" and rearing new obstacles to emancipation. They feared 
that centralization would reinforce the ability of the bourgeoisie to resist the 
revolution and instill in the workers a sense of obedience. They tried to rescue 
all those pre-capitalist communal forms (such as the Russian <i>mir</i> and the 
Spanish <i>pueblo</i>) which might provide a springboard to a free society, not 
only in a structural sense but also a spiritual one. Hence they emphasized the 
need for decentralization even under capitalism. In contrast to the Marxian 
parties, their organizations gave considerable attention to what they called 
"integral education"&#8212;the development of the <i>whole</i> man&#8212;to counteract the 
debasing and banalizing influence of bourgeois society. The anarchists tried to 
live by the values of the future to the extent that this was possible under 
capitalism. They believed in direct action to foster the initiative of the 
"masses," to preserve the spirit of revolt, to encourage spontaneity. They tried 
to develop organizations based on mutual aid and brotherhood, in which control 
would be exercised from below upward, not downward from above.</p>

<p class="fst">We must pause here to examine the nature of anarchist 
organizational forms in some detail, if only because the subject has been 
obscured by an appalling amount of rubbish. Anarchists, or at least 
anarcho-communists, accept the need for organization.<a href="#r19" name="rn19" target="_self">[19*]</a> It should be as 
absurd to have to repeat this point as to argue over whether Marx accepted the 
need for social revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The real question at issue here is not organization versus 
non-organization, but rather what <i>kind</i> of organization the 
anarcho-communists try to establish. What the different kinds of 
anarcho-communist organizations have in common is organic developments from 
below, not bodies engineered into existence from above. They are social 
movements, combining a creative revolutionary lifestyle with a creative 
revolutionary theory, not political parties whose mode of life is 
indistinguishable from the surrounding bourgeois environment and whose ideology 
is reduced to rigid "tried and tested programs." As much as is humanly possible, 
they try to reflect the liberated society they seek to achieve, not slavishly 
duplicate the prevailing system of hierarchy, class and authority. They are 
built around intimate groups of brothers and sisters&#8212;affinity groups&#8212;whose 
ability to act in common is based on initiative, on convictions freely arrived 
at, and on a deep personal involvement, not around a bureaucratic apparatus 
fleshed out by a docile membership and manipulated from above by a handful of 
all-knowing leaders.</p>

<p class="fst">The anarcho-communists do not deny the need for coordination 
between groups, for discipline, for meticulous planning, and for unity in 
action. But they believe that coordination, discipline, planning, and unity in 
action must be achieved <i>voluntarily</i>, by means of a self-discipline 
nourished by conviction and understanding, not by coercion and a mindless, 
unquestioning obedience to orders from above. They seek to achieve the 
effectiveness imputed to centralism by means of voluntarism and insight, not by 
establishing a hierarchical, centralized structure. Depending upon needs or 
circumstances, affinity groups can achieve this effectiveness through 
assemblies, action committees, and local, regional or national conferences. But 
they vigorously oppose the establishment of an organizational structure that 
becomes an end in itself, of committees that linger on after their practical 
tasks have been completed, of a "leadership" that reduces the "revolutionary" to 
a mindless robot.</p>

<p class="fst">These conclusions are not the result of flighty "individualist" 
impulses; quite to the contrary, they emerge from an exacting study of past 
revolutions, of the impact centralized parties have had on the revolutionary 
process, and of the nature of social change in an era of potential material 
abundance. Anarcho-communists <i>seek to preserve and extend the anarchic phase 
that opens all the great social revolutions</i>. Even more than Marxists, they 
recognize that revolutions are produced by deep historical processes. No central 
committee "makes" a social revolution; at best it can stage a <i>coup d</i>'<i>état</i>, 
replacing one hierarchy by another&#8212;or worse, arrest a revolutionary process if 
it exercises any widespread influence. A central committee is an organ for 
acquiring power, for <i>recreating</i> power, for gathering to itself what the 
"masses" have achieved by their own revolutionary efforts. One must be blind to 
all that has happened over the past two centuries not to recognize these 
essential facts.</p>

<p class="fst">In the past, Marxists could make an intelligible (although 
invalid) claim for the need for a centralized party, because the anarchic phase 
of the revolution was nullified by material scarcity. Economically, the "masses" 
were always compelled to return to a daily life of toil. The revolution closed 
at ten o'clock, quite aside from the reactionary intentions of the Girondins of 
1793; it was arrested by the low level of technology. Today even this excuse has 
been removed by the development of a post-scarcity technology, notably in the 
U.S. and Western Europe. A point has now been reached where the "masses" can 
begin, almost overnight, to expand drastically the "realm of freedom" in the 
Marxian sense&#8212;to acquire the leisure time needed to achieve the highest degree 
of self-management.</p>

<p class="fst">What the May-June events in France demonstrated was not the need 
for a Bolshevik-type party but the need for greater consciousness among the 
"masses." Paris demonstrated that an organization is needed to propagate ideas 
systematically&#8212;and not ideas alone, but <i>ideas which promote the concept of 
self-management</i>. What the French "masses" lacked was not a central committee 
or a Lenin to "organize" or "command" them, but the conviction that they could 
have <i>operated</i> the factories instead of merely occupying them. It is 
noteworthy that <i>not a single Bolshevik-type party in France raised the demand 
of self-management</i>. The demand was raised only by the anarchists and the 
Situationists.</p>

<p class="fst">There is a need for a revolutionary organization&#8212;but its function 
must always be kept clearly in mind. Its first task is propaganda, to "patiently 
explain," as Lenin put it. In a revolutionary situation, the revolutionary 
organization presents the most advanced demands: it is prepared at every turn of 
events to formulate&#8212;in the most concrete fashion&#8212;the immediate task that should 
be performed to advance the revolutionary process. It provides the boldest 
elements in action and in the decision-making organs of the revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">In what way, then, do anarcho-communist groups differ from the 
Bolshevik type of party? Certainly not on such issues as the need for 
organization, planning, coordination, propaganda in all its forms or the need 
for a social program. Fundamentally, they differ from the Bolshevik type of 
party in their belief that genuine revolutionaries must function <i>within the 
framework of the forms created by the revolution</i>, not within the forms 
created by the party. What this means is that their commitment is to the 
revolutionary organs of self-management, not to the revolutionary 
"organization"; to the <i>social</i> forms, not the <i>political</i> forms. 
Anarcho-communists seek to persuade the factory committees, assemblies or 
Soviets to make themselves into <i>genuine organs of popular self-management</i>, 
not to dominate them, manipulate them, or hitch them to an all-knowing political 
party. Anarcho-communists do not seek to rear a state structure over these 
popular revolutionary organs but, on the contrary, to dissolve all the 
organizational forms developed in the prerevolutionary period (including their 
own) into these genuine revolutionary organs.</p>

<p class="fst">These differences are decisive. Despite their rhetoric and 
slogans, the Russian Bolsheviks never believed in the soviets; they regarded 
them as instruments of the Bolshevik Party, an attitude which the French 
Trotskyists faithfully duplicated in their relations with the Sorbonne students' 
assembly, the French Maoists with the French labor unions, and the Old Left 
groups with SDS. By 1921, the Soviets were virtually dead, and all decisions 
were made by the Bolshevik Central Committee and Political Bureau. Not only do 
anarcho-communists seek to prevent Marxist parties from repeating this; they 
also wish to prevent their own organization from playing a similar role. 
Accordingly, they try to prevent bureaucracy, hierarchy and elites from emerging 
in their midst. No less important, they attempt to <i>remake themselves</i>; to 
root out from their own personalities those authoritarian traits and elitist 
propensities that are assimilated in hierarchical society almost from birth. The 
concern of the anarchist movement with lifestyle is not merely a preoccupation 
with its own integrity, but with the integrity of the revolution itself.<a href="#r20" name="rn20" target="_self">[20*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the midst of all the confusing ideological crosscurrents of 
our time, one question must always remain in the foreground: what the hell are 
we trying to make a revolution for? Are we trying to make a revolution to 
recreate hierarchy, dangling a shadowy dream of future freedom before the eyes 
of humanity? Is it to promote further technological advance, to create an even 
greater abundance of goods than exists today? It is to "get even" with the 
bourgeoisie? Is it to bring PL to power? Or the Communist Party? Or the 
Socialist Workers Party? Is it to emancipate abstractions such as "The 
Proletariat," "The People," "History," "Society"?</p>

<p class="fst">Or is it finally to dissolve hierarchy, class rule and coercion&#8212;<i>to 
make it possible for each individual to gain control of his everyday life</i>? 
Is it to make each moment as marvelous as it could be and the life span of each 
individual an utterly fulfilling experience? If the true purpose of revolution 
is to bring the neanderthal men of PL to power, it is not worth making. We need 
hardly argue the inane questions of whether individual development can be 
severed from social and communal development; obviously the two go together. The 
basis for a whole human being is a rounded society; the basis for a free human 
being is a free society.</p>

<p class="fst">These issues aside, we are still faced with the question that 
Marx raised in 1850: when will we begin to take our poetry from the future 
instead of the past? The dead must be permitted to bury the dead. Marxism is 
dead because it was rooted in an era of material scarcity, limited in its 
possibilities by material want. The most important social message of Marxism is 
that freedom has material preconditions&#8212;we must survive in order to live. With 
the development of a technology that could not have been conceived by the 
wildest science fiction of Marx's day, the possibility of a post-scarcity 
society now lies before us. All the institutions of propertied society&#8212;class 
rule, hierarchy, the patriarchal family, bureaucracy, the city, the state&#8212;have 
been exhausted. Today, decentralization is not only desirable as a means of 
restoring the human scale, it is necessary to recreate a viable ecology, to 
preserve life on this planet from destructive pollutants and soil erosion, to 
preserve a breathable atmosphere and the balance of nature. The promotion of 
spontaneity is necessary if the social revolution is to place each individual in 
control of his everyday life.</p>

<p class="fst">The old forms of struggle do not totally disappear with the 
decomposition of class society, but they are being transcended by the issues of 
a classless society. There can be no social revolution without winning the 
workers, hence they must have our active solidarity in every struggle they wage 
against exploitation. We fight against social crimes wherever they appear&#8212;and 
industrial exploitation is a profound social crime. But so are racism, the 
denial of the right to self-determination, imperialism and poverty profound 
social crimes&#8212;and for that matter so are pollution, rampant urbanization, the 
malignant socialization of the young, and sexual repression. As for the problem 
of winning the working class to the revolution, we must bear in mind that a 
precondition for the existence of the bourgeoisie is the development of the 
proletariat. Capitalism as a social system presupposes the existence of <i>both</i> 
classes and is perpetuated by the development of both classes. We begin to 
undermine the premises of class rule to the degree that we foster the 
declassifying of the non-bourgeois classes, at least institutionally, 
psychologically and culturally.</p>

<p class="fst">For the first time in history, the anarchic phase that opened all 
the great revolutions of the past can be preserved as a permanent condition by 
the advanced technology of our time. The anarchic institutions of that phase&#8212;the 
assemblies, the factory committees, the action committees&#8212;can be stabilized as 
the elements of a liberated society, as the elements of a new system of 
self-management. Will we build a movement that can defend them? Can we create an 
organization of affinity groups that is capable of dissolving into these 
revolutionary institutions? Or will we build a hierarchical, centralized, 
bureaucratic party that will try to dominate them, supplant them, and finally 
destroy them?</p>

<p class="fst">Listen, Marxist: The organization we try to build is the kind of 
society our revolution will create. Either we will shed the past&#8212;in ourselves as 
well as in our groups&#8212;or there will simply be no future to win.</p>

<h2>[Appendix]</h2>
<h3><a name="h6">A Note on Affinity Groups</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The term "affinity group" is the English translation of the 
Spanish <i>grupo de afinidad</i>, which was the name of an organizational form 
devised in pre-Franco days as the basis of the redoubtable Federación Anarquista 
Ibérica, the Iberian Anarchist Federation. (The FAI consisted of the most 
idealistic militants in the CNT, the immense anarcho-syndicalist labor union.) A 
slavish imitation of the FAI's forms of organization and methods would be 
neither possible nor desirable. The Spanish anarchists of the thirties were 
faced with entirely different social problems from those which confront American 
anarchists today. The affinity group form, however, has features that apply to 
any social situation, and these have often been intuitively adopted by American 
radicals, who call the resulting organizations "collectives," communes" or 
"families."</p>

<p class="fst">The affinity group could easily be regarded as a new type of 
extended family, in which kinship ties are replaced by deeply empathetic human 
relationships&#8212;relationships nourished by common revolutionary ideas and 
practice. Long before the word "tribe" gained popularity in the American 
counterculture, the Spanish anarchists called their congresses <i>asambleas de 
las tribus</i>&#8212;assemblies of the tribes. Each affinity group is deliberately 
kept small to allow for the greatest degree of intimacy between those who 
compose it. Autonomous, communal and directly democratic, the group combines 
revolutionary theory with revolutionary lifestyle in its everyday behavior. It 
creates a free space in which revolutionaries can remake themselves 
individually, and also as social beings.</p>

<p class="fst">Affinity groups are intended to function as catalysts within the 
popular movement, not as "vanguards"; they provide initiative and consciousness, 
not a "general staff" and a source of "command." The groups proliferate on a 
molecular level and they have their own "Brownian movement." Whether they link 
together or separate is determined by living situations, not by bureaucratic 
fiat from a distant center. Under conditions of political repression, affinity 
groups are highly resistant to police infiltration. Owing to the intimacy of the 
relationships between the participants, the groups are often difficult to 
penetrate and, even if penetration occurs, there is no centralized apparatus to 
provide the infiltrator with an overview of the movement as a whole. Even under 
such demanding conditions, affinity groups can still retain contact with each 
other through their periodicals and literature.</p>

<p class="fst">During periods of heightened activity, on the other hand, nothing 
prevents affinity groups from working together closely on any scale required by 
a living situation. They can easily federate by means of local, regional or 
national assemblies to formulate common policies and they can create temporary 
action committees (like those of the French students and workers in 1968) to 
coordinate specific tasks. Affinity groups, however, are always rooted in the 
popular movement. Their loyalties belong to the social forms created by the 
revolutionary people, not to an impersonal bureaucracy. As a result of their 
autonomy and localism, the groups can retain a sensitive appreciation of new 
possibilities. Intensely experimental and variegated in lifestyles, they act as 
a stimulus on each other as well as on the popular movement. Each group tries to 
acquire the resources needed to function largely on its own. Each group seeks a 
rounded body of knowledge and experience in order to overcome the social and 
psychological limitations imposed by bourgeois society on individual 
development. Each group, as a nucleus of consciousness and experience, tries to 
advance the spontaneous revolutionary movement of the people to a point where 
the group can finally disappear into the organic social forms created by the 
revolution.</p>

relationship in its correct perspective, a praxis of theory. This is the very 
meaning of Marx's transformation of dialectics, which took it from the 
subjective dimension (to which the Young Hegelians still tried to confine 
Hegel's outlook) into the objective, from philosophical critique into social 
action. If theory and praxis become divorced, Marxism is not killed, it commits 
suicide. This is its most admirable and noble feature. The attempts of the 
cretins who follow in Marx's wake to keep the system alive with a patchwork of 
emendations, exegesis, and half-assed "scholarship" a la Maurice Dobb and George

forms the focal point of Marx's economic theories.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r5" href="#rn5">[5*]</a> For ecological reasons, we do not accept the notion of the 
"domination of nature by man" in the simplistic sense that was passed on by Marx 
a century ago. For a discussion of this problem, see "Ecology and Revolutionary 
Thought."</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r6" href="#rn6">[6*]</a> It is ironic that Marxists who talk about the "economic 
power" of the proletariat are actually echoing the position of the 
anarcho-syndicalists, a position that Marx bitterly opposed. Marx was not 
concerned with the "economic power" of the proletariat but with its <i>political</i> 
power; notably the fact that it would become the majority of the population. He 
was convinced that the <i>industrial</i> workers would be driven to revolution 
primarily by material destitution which would follow from the tendency of 
capitalist accumulation; that, <i>organized</i> by the factory system and <i>
disciplined</i> by industrial routine, they would be able to constitute trade 
unions and, above all, political parties, which in some countries would be 
obliged to use insurrectionary methods and in others (England, the United 
States, and in later years Engels added France) might well come to power in 
elections and legislate socialism into existence. Characteristically, many 
Marxists have been as dishonest with their Marx and Engels as the Progressive 
Labor Party has been with the readers of <i>Challenge</i>, leaving important 
observations untranslated or grossly distorting Marx's meaning.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r7" href="#rn7">[7*]</a> This is as good a place as any to dispose of the notion that 
anyone is a "proletarian" who has nothing to sell but his labor power. It is 
true that Marx defined the proletariat in these terms, but he also worked out a 
historical dialectic in the development of the proletariat. The proletariat 
developed out of a propertyless exploited class, reaching its most advanced form 
in the <i>industrial</i> proletariat, which corresponded to the most advanced 
form of capital. In the later years of his life, Marx came to despise the 
Parisian workers, who were engaged preponderantly in the production of luxury 
goods, citing "our German workers"&#8212;the most robot-like in Europe&#8212;as the "model" 
proletariat of the world.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r8" href="#rn8">[8*]</a> The attempt to describe Marx's immiseration theory in 
international terms instead of national (as Marx did) is sheer subterfuge. In 
the first place, this theoretical legerdemain simply tries to sidestep the 
question of why immiseration has not occurred within the industrial strongholds 
of capitalism, the <i>only areas which form a technologically adequate point of 
departure for a classless society</i>. If we are to pin our hopes on the 
colonial world as "the proletariat," this position conceals a very real danger: 
genocide. America and her recent ally Russia have all the technical means to 
bomb the underdeveloped world into submission. A threat lurks on the historical 
horizon&#8212;the development of the United States into a truly fascist imperium of 
the nazi type. It is sheer rubbish to say that this country is a "paper tiger." 
It is a thermonuclear tiger and the American ruling class, lacking any cultural 
restraints, is capable of being even more vicious than the German.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r9" href="#rn9">[9*]</a> Lenin sensed this and described "socialism" as "nothing but 
state capitalist monopoly <i>made to benefit the whole people</i>. "<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> This is 
an extraordinary statement if one thinks out its implications, and a mouthful of 
contradictions.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r10" href="#rn10">[10*]</a> On this score, the Old Left projects its own neanderthal 
image on the American worker. Actually this image more closely approximates the 
character of the union bureaucrat or the Stalinist commissar.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r11" href="#rn11">[11*]</a> The worker, in this sense, begins to approximate the 
socially transitional human types who have provided history with its most 
revolutionary elements. Generally, the "proletariat" has been most revolutionary 
in transitional periods, when it was least "proletarianized" psychically by the 
industrial system. The great focuses of the classical workers' revolutions were 
Petrograd and Barcelona, where the workers had been directly uprooted from a 
peasant background, and Paris, where they were still anchored in crafts or came 
directly from a craft background. These workers had the greatest difficulty in 
acclimating themselves to industrial domination and became a continual source of 
social and revolutionary unrest. By contrast, the stable hereditary working 
class tended to be surprisingly non-revolutionary. Even in the case of the 
German workers who were cited by Marx and Engels as models for the European 
proletariat, the majority did not support the Spartacists in 1919. They returned 
large majorities of official Social Democrats to the Congress of Workers' 
Councils, and to the Reichstag in later years, and rallied consistently behind 
the Social Democratic Party right up to 1933.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r12" href="#rn12">[12*]</a> This revolutionary lifestyle may develop in the factories as 
well as on the streets, in schools as well as in crash-pads, in the suburbs as 
well as on the Bay Area-East Side axis. Its essence is defiance, and a personal 
"propaganda of the deed" that erodes all the mores, institutions and shibboleths 
of domination. As society begins to approach the threshold of the revolutionary 
period, the factories, schools and neighborhoods become the actual arena of 
revolutionary "play"&#8212;a "play" that has a very serious core. Strikes become a 
chronic condition and are called for their own sake to break the veneer of 
routine, to defy the society on an almost hourly basis, to shatter the mood of 
bourgeois normality. This new mood of the workers, students and neighborhood 
people is a vital precursor to the actual moment of revolutionary 
transformation. Its most conscious expression is the demand for 
"self-management"; the worker refuses to be a "managed" being, a <i>class</i> 
being. This process was most evident in Spain, on the eve of the 1936 
revolution, when workers in almost every city and town called strikes "for the 
hell of it"&#8212;to express their independence, their sense of awakening, their break 
with the social order and with bourgeois conditions of life. It was also an 
essential feature of the 1968 general strike in France.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r13" href="#rn13">[13*]</a> A fact which Trotsky never understood. He never followed 
through the consequences of his own concept of "combined development" to its 
logical conclusions. He saw (quite correctly) that czarist Russia, the latecomer 
in the European bourgeois development, necessarily acquired the most advanced 
industrial and class forms instead of recapitulating the entire bourgeois 
development from its beginnings. He neglected to consider that Russia, torn by 
tremendous internal upheaval, might even run ahead of the capitalist development 
elsewhere in Europe. Hypnotized by the formula "nationalized property equals 
socialism," he failed to recognize that monopoly capitalism itself tends to 
amalgamate with the state by its own inner dialectic. The Bolsheviks, having 
cleared away the traditional forms of bourgeois social organization (which still 
act as a rein on the state capitalist development in Europe and America), 
inadvertently prepared the ground for a "pure" state capitalist development in 
which the state finally becomes the ruling class. Lacking support from a 
technologically advanced Europe, the Russian Revolution became an internal 
counterrevolution; Soviet Russia became a form of state capitalism that does not 
"benefit the whole people." Lenin's analogy between "socialism" and state 
capitalism became a terrifying reality under Stalin. Despite its humanistic 
core, Marxism failed to comprehend how much its concept of "socialism" 
approximates a later stage of capitalism itself&#8212;the return to mercantile forms 
on a higher industrial level. The failure to understand this development led to 
devastating theoretical confusion in the contemporary revolutionary movement, as 
witness the splits among the Trotskyists over this question.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r14" href="#rn14">[14*]</a> The March 22nd Movement functioned as a catalytic agent in 
the events, not as a leadership. It did not command; it instigated, leaving a 
free play to the events. This free play, which allowed the students to push 
ahead on their own momentum, was indispensable to the dialectic of the uprising, 
for without it there would have been no barricades on May 10, which in turn 
triggered off the general strike of the workers.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r15" href="#rn15">[15*]</a> See "The Forms of Freedom" [New York, January 1968].</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r16" href="#rn16">[16*]</a> With a sublime arrogance that is attributable partly to 
ignorance, a number of Marxist groups were to dub virtually all of the above 
forms of self-management as "Soviets." The attempt to bring all of these 
different forms under a single rubric is not only misleading but willfully 
obscurantist. The actual Soviets were the least democratic of the revolutionary 
forms and the Bolsheviks shrewdly used them to transfer the power to their own 
party. The Soviets were not based on face-to-face democracy, like the Parisian 
sections or the student assemblies of 1968. Nor were they based on economic 
self-management, like the Spanish anarchist factory committees. The Soviets 
actually formed a workers' parliament, hierarchically organized, which drew its 
representation from factories and later from military units and peasant 
villages.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r17" href="#rn17">[17*]</a> V. I. Lenin, "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government," 
in <i>Selected Works</i>, vol. 7 (International Publishers; New York, 1943), p. 
342. In this harsh article, published in April 1918, Lenin completely abandoned 
the libertarian perspective he had advanced the year before in <i>State and 
Revolution</i>. The main themes of the article are the needs for "discipline," 
for authoritarian control over the factories, and for the institution of the 
Taylor system (a system Lenin had denounced before the revolution as enslaving 
men to the machine). The article was written during a comparatively peaceful 
period of Bolshevik rule some two months after the signing of the Brest-Litovsk 
Treaty and a month before the revolt of the Czech Legion in the Urals&#8212;the revolt 
that started the civil war on a wide scale and opened the period of direct 
Allied intervention in Russia. Finally, the article was written nearly a year 
before the defeat of the German revolution. It would be difficult to account for 
the "Immediate Tasks" merely in terms of the Russian civil war and the failure 
of the European revolution.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r18" href="#rn18">[18*]</a> In interpreting this elemental movement of the Russian 
workers and peasants as a series of "White Guard conspiracies," "acts of kulak 
resistance," and "plots of international capital," the Bolsheviks reached an 
incredible theoretical low and deceived no one but themselves. A spiritual 
erosion developed within the party that paved the way for the politics of the 
secret police, for character assassination, and finally for the Moscow trials 
and the annihilation of the Old Bolshevik cadre. One sees the return of this 
odious mentality in PL articles like "Marcuse: Cop-out or Cop?"&#8212;the theme of 
which is to establish Marcuse as an agent of the CIA. (See <i>Progressive Labor</i>, 
February 1969.) The article has a caption under a photograph of demonstrating 
Parisians which reads: "Marcuse got to Paris too late to stop the May action." 
Opponents of the PLP are invariably described by this rag as "redbaiters" and as 
"anti-worker." If the American left does not repudiate this police approach and 
character assassination it will pay bitterly in the years to come.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r19" href="#rn19">[19*]</a> The term "anarchist" is a generic word like the term 
"socialist," and there are probably as many different kinds of anarchists as 
there are socialists. In both cases, the spectrum ranges from individuals whose 
views derive from an extension of liberalism (the "individualist anarchists," 
the social-democrats) to revolutionary communists (the anarcho-communists, the 
revolutionary Marxists, Leninists and Trotskyists).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="r20" href="#rn20">[20*]</a> It is this goal, we may add, that motivates anarchist 
dadaism, the anarchist flipout that produces the creases of consternation on the 
wooden faces of PLP types. The anarchist flipout attempts to shatter the 
internal values inherited from hierarchical society, to explode the rigidities 
instilled by the bourgeois socialization process. In short, it is an attempt to 
break down the superego that exercises such a paralyzing effect upon 
spontaneity, imagination and sensibility and to restore a sense of desire, 
possibility and the marvelous&#8212;of revolution as a liberating, joyous festival.</p>
