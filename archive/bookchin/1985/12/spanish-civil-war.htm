<p class="fst">Between myth and reality there lies a precarious zone of 
transition that occasionally captures the truth of each. Spain, caught in a 
world-historic revolution fifty years ago, was exactly such an occasion&#8212;a rare 
moment when the most generous, almost mythic dreams of freedom seemed suddenly 
to become real for millions of Spanish workers, peasants, and intellectuals. For 
this brief period of time, this shimmering moment, as it were, the world stood 
breathlessly still, while the red banners of revolutionary socialism and the 
red-and-black banners of revolutionary anarchosyndicalism floated over most of 
Spain's major cities and thousands of her villages.</p>

<p class="fst">Taken together with the massive, spontaneous collectivization of 
factories, fields, even hotels and restaurants, the oppressed classes of Spain 
reclaimed history with a force and passion of an unprecedented scope and gave a 
stunning reality in many areas of the peninsula to the ageless dream of a free 
society. The Spanish Civil War of 1936-39 was, at its inception, the last of the 
classical European workers' and peasants' revolutions&#8212;not, let me make it clear, 
a short-lived "uprising," a cadre-controlled "guerrilla war," or a simple civil 
conflict between regions for national supremacy. And like so many life-forms 
that appear for the last time, before fading away forever, it was the most 
far-reaching and challenging of all such popular movements of the great 
revolutionary era that encompasses Cromwellian England of the late 1640s and the 
working-class uprisings of Vienna and Asturias of the early 1930s.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not a myth but a sheer lie&#8212;the cretinous perversion of 
history by its makers in the academy&#8212;to depict the Spanish Civil War as a mere 
prelude to World War II, an alleged conflict between "democracy and fascism." 
Not even World War II deserves the honor of this ideological characterization. 
Spain was seized by more than a civil war: it was in the throes of a profound 
social revolution. Nor was this revolution, like so many self-styled ones of 
recent years, simply the product of Spain's struggle for modernization. If 
anything, Spain was one of those very rare countries where problems of 
modernization helped inspire a <i>real</i> social revolution rather than a 
reaction or adaptation to Western and Eastern Europe's economic and social 
development. This seemingly "Third World" feature of the Spanish Civil War and, 
above all, the extraordinary alternatives it posed to capitalism and 
authoritarian forms of socialism make the revolution hauntingly relevant to 
liberation movements today. In modernizing the country, the Spanish working 
class and peasantry literally took over much of its economy and managed it 
directly in the form of collectives, cooperatives, and union-networked 
syndicalist structures. Democratically-run militias, free of all ranking 
distinctions and organized around a joint decision-making process that involved 
the soldiers as well as their elected "commanders," moved rapidly to the 
military fronts.</p>

<p class="fst">To have stopped Franco's "Army of Africa," composed of foreign 
legionnaires and Moorish mercenaries&#8212;perhaps the blood-thirstiest and certainly 
one of the most professionalized troops at the disposal of any European nation 
at the time&#8212;and its well-trained Civil Guards and police auxiliaries, would have 
been nothing less than miraculous once it established a strong base on the 
Spanish mainland. That hastily formed, untrained, and virtually unequipped 
militiamen and women slowed up Franco's army's advance on Madrid for four months 
and essentially stopped it on the outskirts of the capital is a feat for which 
they have rarely earned the proper tribute from writers on the civil war of the 
past half century.</p>

<p class="fst">Behind the "Republican" lines, power lay essentially in the hands 
of the trade unions and their political organizations: the million-member 
General Confederation of Workers (UGT), the labor federation of the Socialist 
Workers Party (PSOE), and the equally large General Confederation of Labor 
(CNT), strongly influenced by the semi-clandestine Iberian Anarchist Federation 
(FAI). Additionally, another leftist organization, the Workers Party of Marxist 
Unification (POUM), whose more radical members and leaders had been rooted in a 
Trotskyist tradition in earlier years, followed up the more influential 
socialists and anarchists. In Catalonia, the POUM outnumbered by far the 
Communist and Socialist Parties which united to form the predominantly 
Communist-controlled Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC). The Communist 
Party (PCE) at the inception of the revolution was inconsequential in numbers 
and influence, lagging far behind the three major left-wing organizations and 
their unions.</p>

<p class="fst">The wave of collectivizations that swept over Spain in the summer 
and autumn of 1936 has been described in a recent BBC-Granada documentary as 
"the greatest experiment in workers' self-management Western Europe has ever 
seen," a revolution more far-reaching than any which occurred in Russia during 
1917-21 and the years before and after it.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
In anarchist industrial areas like Catalonia, an estimated three-quarters of the 
economy was placed under workers' control, as it was in anarchist rural areas 
like Aragon. The figure tapers downward where the UGT shared power with the CNT 
or else predominated: 50 percent in anarchist and socialist Valencia, and 30 
percent in socialist and liberal Madrid. In the more thoroughly anarchist areas, 
particularly among the agrarian collectives, money was eliminated and the 
material means of life were allocated strictly according to need rather than 
work, following the traditional precepts of a libertarian communist society. As 
the BBC-Granada television documentary puts it: "The ancient dream of a 
collective society without profit or property was made reality in the villages 
of Aragon. ... All forms of production were owned by the community, run by 
their workers."</p>

<p class="fst">The administrative apparatus of "Republican" Spain belonged 
almost entirely to the unions and their political organizations. Police in many 
cities were replaced by armed workers' patrols. Militia units were formed 
everywhere&#8212;in factories, on farms, and in socialist and anarchist community 
centers and union halls, initially including women as well as men. A vast 
network of local revolutionary committees coordinated the feeding of the cities, 
the operations of the economy, and the meting out of justice, indeed, almost 
every facet of Spanish life from production to culture, bringing the whole of 
Spanish society in the "Republican" zone into a well-organized and coherent 
whole. This historically unprecedented appropriation of society by its most 
oppressed sectors&#8212;including women, who were liberated from all the constraints 
of a highly traditional Catholic country, be it the prohibition of abortion and 
divorce or a degraded status in the economy&#8212;was the work of the Spanish 
proletariat and peasantry. It was a movement from below that overwhelmed even 
the revolutionary organizations of the oppressed, including the CNT-FAI. 
"Significantly, no left organization issued calls for revolutionary takeovers of 
factories, workplaces or the land," observes Ronald Fraser in one of the most 
up-to-date accounts of the popular movement. "Indeed, the CNT leadership in 
Barcelona, epicenter of urban anarchosyndicalism, went further: rejecting the 
offer of power presented to it by President Companys <span class="inote">[the head of the Catalan 
government]</span>, it decided that the libertarian revolution must stand aside for 
collaboration with the Popular Front forces to defeat the common enemy. The 
revolution that transformed Barcelona in a matter of days into a city virtually 
run by the working class sprang initially from individual CNT unions, impelled 
by their most advanced militants; and as their example spread it was not only 
large enterprises but small workshops and businesses that were being taken over.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">I quote Fraser to emphasize the remarkable power of education and 
discussion, and the critical examination of experience in the development of 
many segments of the Spanish working class and peasantry. For Communists like 
Eric Hobsbawn to designate these segments, largely influenced by anarchist 
ideas, as "primitive rebels" is worse than prejudice; it represents ideology 
mechanically imposed on the flux of history, organizing it into "stages" of 
development in flat contradiction to real life and freezing it into categories 
that exist solely in the mind of the historian. Since Spain, as we are told, was 
a predominately agrarian country, in fact, "feudal" in its social structure, its 
proletariat must have been "undeveloped" and its peasantry caught in a fever of 
"millennarian" expectations. These "primitive" features of Spain's development 
somehow account, so the story goes, for the more than one million members of the 
anarchosyndicalist CNT out of a population of twenty-four million. Spain's 
bourgeoisie, it is further argued, was the cowed stepchild of the country's 
territorial grandees, its clerics, and its bloated officer corps; Spain needed a 
"bourgeois-democratic" revolution, akin to the French and American, as a 
"historical precondition" for a "socialist" one. This "stages theory," with its 
salad of "preconditions," was invoked with considerable effectiveness by the 
Communist International in the 1930s against the reality of an authentic 
workers' and peasants' revolution. Where it could not be completely concealed 
from the outside world, the revolution was denounced by the Communists as 
"premature" in a "balance of history" that was determined somewhere in the 
foreign commissariat of Stalinist Russia and resolutely assaulted by the PCE on 
a scale that brought "Republican" Spain to the edge of a civil war within the 
civil war.</p>

<p class="fst">Recent accounts of Spain and the revolution of 1936 give us a 
very different picture of the country's society from its portrayal by the 
Communists, their liberal allies, and even by such well-intentioned observers as 
Gerald Brenan and Franz Borkenau. Despite its outward trappings, Spain was not 
the overwhelmingly agrarian and "feudal" country we were taught it was two 
generations ago. From the turn of the century to the coming of the Second 
Republic in 1931, Spain had undergone enormous economic growth with major 
changes in the relative weight of the agricultural and nonagricultural sectors. 
From 1910 to 1930 the peasantry had declined from 66 percent to 45.5 percent of 
the working population, while industrial workers had soared from 15.8 percent to 
26.5 percent and those in services from 18.1 percent to 27.9 percent. Indeed, 
the peasantry now formed a minority of the population, not its traditional 
majority, and a substantial portion of the "peasantry" owned land, particularly 
in areas that adhered to the highly conservative "National Front" as against the 
liberal-socialist-communist coalition under the rubric of the "Popular Front." 
Indeed, omitting the Center parties the "Popular Front"&#8212;whose election in 
February 1936 precipitated the military plots that led to the Francoist 
rebellion six months later&#8212;received only 54 percent of the vote in a voting 
procedure and under circumstances that favored them. Moreover, as Edward 
Malefakis has shown in his thoroughly researched study of agrarian unrest in the 
period leading up to the civil war, the CNT had its greatest strength among the 
industrial working class of Catalonia, not among the "millennarian" agricultural 
day-workers of the South. Many of these <i>braceros</i> joined socialist unions 
in the 1930s, pushing the reformist Socialist party in an increasingly 
revolutionary direction.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Spain's rapid rate of industrialization and the shift of the 
country from "feudal" to essentially capitalist forms of agriculture occurred 
well in advance of the "Popular Front" victory. The decade of the 1920s under 
the fairly indulgent, Mussolini-type dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (a Spanish 
parody of Italian fascism in which leading Socialists like Largo Caballero 
actually held official positions as did other UGT chieftains), saw an economic 
modernization of the country that almost equaled and in some cases exceeded the 
boom years under Franco between 1960 and 1973. Illiteracy was substantially 
decreased, and economic expansion was accelerated; hence the very sizable middle 
class or service workers with middle-class values that could be played against 
the militant working class of Spain.</p>

<p class="fst">The greatest single reservoir of economic unrest was in the 
south: Andalusia's plantation or <i>latifundia</i> society, structured around 
the cultivation of olives, cereals, grapes&#8212;and the large workforce of 
desperately poor, half-starved landless day-laborers. Caught in the trammels of 
Spain's quasifeudal grandees, hundreds of thousands of <i>braceros</i> lived in 
bitter desperation, a way of life that contrasted with the opulence and cold 
arrogance of the royalist upper class of nobles and bourgeois who were to form 
the cutting edge of Franco's rebellion and were the principal beneficiaries of 
his victory.</p>

<p class="fst">Periodic uprisings of the <i>braceros</i> had culminated in an 
agrarian war in 1918-20 and were put down mercilessly, leaving a legacy of 
savage class hatred that expressed itself in the burning of crops, farm 
buildings, and rural mansions (many of which were turned into virtual fortresses 
during times of social unrest), and assassinations on both sides of the class 
barrier. Long before the 1930s, Andalusia became, for all practical purposes, an 
occupied territory where Civil Guards patrolled the countryside and, together 
with armed thugs hired by landowners, fired wantonly at striking <i>braceros</i> 
and created the endemic violence that claimed an appalling toll during the first 
weeks of the civil war. Yet here too, agriculture was largely capitalistic in 
its orientation toward the marketplace. Andalusia's produce was cultivated 
largely for international trade. Noble titles often concealed bourgeois avarice 
in its most unfeeling form, and upper-class references to the "tradition" of 
Spain barely camouflaged pernicious greed and privilege.</p>

<p class="fst">What cannot be ignored after presenting this tableau is the 
extent to which the crisis that led to the 1936 revolution was cultural as well 
as economic. Spain was a land of several nations: Basques and Catalans who 
sought autonomy for their respective cultures and viewed Spanish lifeways with a 
measure of disdain; Castilians who appeared as the collective oppressors of the 
peninsula, despite their own internal divisions; an arrogant nobility that fed 
on images of Spain's "golden era" and lived in almost parochial isolation from 
the real Spain that surrounded them; an incestuous officer caste that belonged 
to one of the country's lingering "orders" and for whom "national regeneration" 
had devolved from the values of liberalism and "modernity" to those of sheer 
reaction; finally, a virtually medieval Church that was excessively propertied, 
rigidly hierarchical, and often bitterly hated because of the contrast between 
its pious rhetoric of human "brotherhood" and its patent partisanship with the 
upper classes.</p>

<p class="fst">Above all, Spain was a land in which cultures were in dramatic 
transition between town and country, feudalism and capitalism&#8212;a nostalgic world 
that looked back to a past of aristocratic supremacy and forward to a future of 
plebeian egalitarianism that found its most radical form in a huge 
anarchosyndicalist movement. What made the Spanish working class so uniquely 
revolutionary, in my view, was its well-rooted ancestry in the countryside&#8212;in a 
relatively slow-paced, organic agrarian world that clashed sharply with the 
highly rationalized, mechanized industrial world of the cities. In the 
force-field of these two cultures, Spanish workers in the Mediterranean coastal 
cities retained an obduracy, a sense of moral tension, a feeling for 
preindustrial lifeways, and a commitment to community that cannot be conveyed to 
a generation immured in the received wisdom and prepackaged lifeways of a highly 
commodified, market-oriented era.</p>

<p class="fst">The intensity of this force-field was heightened by a Spanish 
heritage of strong sociability: urban <i>barrios</i> were actually intimate 
villages within the city, knitted together by cafes, community centers and union 
halls and energized by a vital outdoor public life that stood at sharp variance 
with the aristocratic mythos of the Spanish past and the hated Church which had 
abdicated all claims to public service. The elite classes of the country, so 
completely divorced from those who worked for them, were highly protective of 
the privileges conferred upon them by pedigree, status, and landed wealth, which 
often produced fissures as bourgeois parvenus began to enter a social terrain 
guarded for centuries by tradition and history.</p>

<p class="fst">Accordingly, one <i>always</i> "belonged" in a deeply social, 
cultural, regional, class, and economic sense&#8212;whether it was to a part of Spain, 
to a hierarchy, a caste, a clan, an institution (be it the army or a union), and 
finally, to a neighborhood, village, town, city, and province, precisely in that 
order of loyalty. In this cultural sense affiliations and antagonisms often 
overrode economic considerations to an extent that is now barely comprehensible 
To cite only one example, the workers of Saragossa, even more anarchist in their 
ideology than their syndicalistic comrades in Barcelona, disdained strikes for 
"paltry" economic demands; they normally put down their tools in behalf of their 
brothers and sisters in prisons or over issues of politics, human rights, and 
class solidarity. In one truly incredible instance, these "pure" anarchists 
declared a twenty-four-hour general-strike because the German Communist leader, 
Ernst Thälmann, had been arrested by Hitler.</p>

<p class="fst">Behind this vibrantly radical culture was a rich tradition of 
direct action, self-management, and confederal association. Spain had barely 
become a nation-state under Ferdinand and Isabella&#8212;the "Catholic monarchs" who 
conquered the last Moorish strongholds on the peninsula&#8212;when the monarchy was 
faced with a historic crisis. Under the <i>Comuneros</i> (translated literally, 
the Communards), Castile's major cities rose up in revolt to demand what was 
virtually a form of nationhood structured primarily around a confederation of 
municipalities. In this remarkable moment when a confederal political system 
hovered as an alternative to a centralized nation-state, Castilian cities 
created short-lived ward democracies and neighborhood assemblies and 
enfranchised people in the lowest ranks of the community on a scale that would 
have sent a shudder of fear through Europe's ruling elites, possibly comparable 
to the impact of the Paris Commune of 1871.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> 
Such confederal movements percolated through Spanish history for generations . 
They took real-life form in the extraordinary power of local society over 
centralized state institutions, exploding in movements like the Federalists of 
Pi y Margall of the early 1870s and the anarchists schooled in the writings of 
Bakunin. But Spanish localism and confederalism were not strictly an anarchist 
phenomenon: they were Spanish to the core and infused the most traditional 
socialists, even the Basque nationalists, who advanced municipalist notions of 
political control against the centralized state's authority well into the 1930s.</p>

<p class="fst">Spanish radicalism, in effect, raised questions and provided 
answers that have a unique relevance to the problems of our day: local autonomy, 
confederalism, collectivism, self-management, and base democracy in opposition 
to state centralism, nationalization, managerial control, and bureaucracy. The 
world did not know this in 1936, nor does it understood the scope of these 
issues adequately today. Indeed, Spanish radicalism also raised ideological 
images that history rendered obsolete in Europe: images of a classical 
proletarian insurrection, barricades, a syndicalist triumph of revolutionary 
trade unions, and inchoate notions of emancipation cloaked in a Bolshevik mantle 
claimed by Stalin rather than in Spain's own popular traditions. It was this 
swirling vortex of social dislocations that the Spanish army tried to still, a 
vortex of institutional relics, an agrarian crisis where large-scale 
agribusiness dressed in aristocratic vestments was pitted against a ragged, 
land-hungry, labor force of day-workers, and an arrogant nobility, an avaricious 
bourgeoisie, an inordinately materialistic Church, and a servile middle class 
against the most volatile proletariat and peasantry Europe had seen in a century 
of revolutionary anarchism and socialism.</p>

<p class="fst">The events leading to the outbreak of civil war can be dealt with 
summarily. In Spain, history seems to repeat itself first as farce and only 
later as tragedy. The social dislocations that followed World War I seem almost 
a comic anticipation of the developments that preceded Franco's uprising. A wave 
of revolutionary unrest gave way in 1923 to the military dictatorship of General 
Primo de Rivera, a pleasure-loving, rather dissolute Andalusian aristocrat who 
easily came to terms with the UGT and the Socialists at the expense of their 
anarchosyndicalist rivals and who essentially ignored the Spanish Communist 
Party because of its sheer insignificance. The boom years of the 1920s were 
followed by a rapid decline in Primo's authoritarian government, which pulled 
the props out from underneath the monarchy itself. In April 1931 Spain returned 
after some two generations to a republican political system, seemingly with 
almost universal enthusiasm&#8212;but the system's authority waned quickly when a 
liberal-Socialist coalition tried to address the crucial agrarian problems that 
had beleaguered all Spanish governments for generations. Hammered on the right 
by the attempted military coup of General Sanjurjo (August 1932) and by 
anarchosyndicalist insurrectionism on the left which culminated in the Casas 
Viejas massacre of Andalusian peasants (January 1933), the coalition lay in the 
debris of its own ill-starred reforms.</p>

<p class="fst">In the summer of 1933, Spain's multitude of parties and 
organizations began to regroup and polarize. In November of that year, a 
coalition of the right, the Spanish Confederation of Right Groups (CEDA) 
replaced the liberal-Socialist coalition headed by Manuel Azaña. The forces that 
consigned the first "Republican" government in some sixty years to the historic 
garbage heap now formed the impetus for a radical shift to the two extremes. 
Disenchanted with liberal ineptitude and subjected to increasing internal 
pressure by the influx of Andalusian <i>braceros</i>, the Socialist Party veered 
sharply from reformism to revolutionism in little more than a year. Just as the 
CEDA found the newly formed fascistic Falange on its far right, so Largo 
Cabellero (now styled the "Lenin of Spain") found the recent POUM, a melding of 
two independent revolutionary Marxist groups, on his far left and the 
anarchosyndicalists in a state of chronic revolution still further off on their 
own.</p>

<p class="fst">The barricades that the Viennese Socialist workers raised early 
in 1934 in the face of a reactionary assault on their very existence had their 
bloody Spanish counterpart eight months later in the "October Revolution" of 
1934, when Asturian miners, raising red and red-and-black flags over the 
mountain towns and cities of northern Spain, became the epicenter of a general 
uprising throughout the country. It was then that the increasingly well-known 
commander of the "Army of Africa," one Francisco Franco, brought Moorish troops 
as well as foreign legionnaires onto Spanish soil for the first time in five 
hundred years to defend "Christian Civilization" from "red barbarism." In a 
taste of the fierce counterrevolutionary retribution that was yet to come, two 
thousand miners were executed in the aftermath of the Asturias uprising and tens 
of thousands of Socialists, anarchosyndicalists, in smaller numbers Communists, 
and even some liberals found themselves in Spanish jails while the rest of the 
country smoldered in a savage class and regional hatred that found its full 
satisfaction two years later.</p>

<p class="fst">Under an ostensibly shared eagerness to free the October 
prisoners and in fear of growing rightist provocation of the kind that had 
finally brought the Viennese Socialists into insurrection, a "Popular Front" was 
slapped together from such widely disparate political groups as the Republican 
left, the Socialists, the Esquerra (Luis Companys's Catalan nationalists), the 
Communist Party, the Syndicalist Party (a political arm of the dissident 
anarchosyndicalist, Angel Pestaña), and the POUM (in Catalonia). The term 
"Popular Front" apparently originated in the French Communist Party and the 
Soviet-French Treaty of Mutual Assistance (May 1935) in which both countries 
vowed to aid each other if either was "threatened or in danger of aggression." 
With the Popular Front, all Western Communist Parties and all their front 
organizations made a sharp <i>volte face</i> from a previous totally insane 
policy of revolutionary adventurism, in which even the CNT was dubbed 
"reformist," to a queasy "line" of total accommodation to the "forces of 
democracy" and an abject surrender of all radical principles to reformism. That 
the new gospel of leftists joining with liberals was nothing less than Stalin's 
wholesale prostitution of the world's Communist Parties for "non-aggression" and 
preferably "mutual assistance" pacts between Russia and any power that was 
prepared to enter the Stalinist brothel became clear by 1936.</p>

<p class="fst">It is difficult today, when radical theory has retreated to the 
couloirs of the academy and radical practice to the smoke-filled rooms of 
liberal politicians, to recognize the crisis of conscience that "Popular 
Frontism" created in the Communist movement. Contrary to recent myths that the 
"Popular Front" was a welcome change of line, a waning generation from the era 
can still recall how American left-wing socialists taunted Communist Party 
members for the rapid desertion of their revolutionary ideals. In Spain, this 
took the form of the particularly cutting remark: "Vote Communist and Save 
Capitalism." The numbers who left "the Party" in bitterness were probably 
immense throughout the world. Yet neither "anti-fascism" nor a passion for 
"bourgeois democracy" can explain what kept thousands of revolutionary 
Communists in the Stalinist movement. That Communist parties were able to 
acquire more members in unprecedented numbers, many of whom were very tentative 
in their commitments, attests to the fact that even in the "red thirties," 
Western Europe and America contained more liberals than radicals. It also 
attests to the uncritical, often mindless loyalty of Communists to the Soviet 
Union as the "first Socialist country" in the world and to the legacy of the 
October Revolution&#8212;even as its leaders were being slaughtered en masse by 
Stalin's NKVD.</p>

<p class="fst">Equally fundamentally the "Popular Front" introduced a doctrinal 
crisis into the corpus of revolutionary Marxism. The very <i>raison d'être</i> 
for a Communist Party <i>anywhere</i> in the world had been Social Democracy's 
legacy of "betrayals," creating the need for a new revolutionary movement. 
"Betrayal," in the language of the day, meant the abandonment of Marx's basic, 
indeed unswerving strategy of revolutionary independence for all authentic 
"workers' parties." This precept, forcefully voiced by Marx and Engels in their 
famous "Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League" (March 1850), 
warned that "everywhere workers' candidates are put up alongside of the 
bourgeois-democratic candidates ... to preserve their independence." As if in 
anticipation of "popular frontism" a century later both men forbade Communists 
from allowing "themselves to be seduced by such arguments of the democrats as, 
for example, that by so doing they are splitting the democratic party and making 
it possible for the reactionaries to win."<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">To abandon these precepts was to assail the authenticity of 
Communism as such, indeed, to discard the most fundamental principles of 
Bolshevism as a truly Marxist politics. It had been on the strength of these 
strategic ideas that the Bolshevik Party had come to power in 1917 and defined 
itself as a revolutionary movement. For Stalin in the Popular Front to adopt 
exactly what Marx Engels, and Lenin had regarded as the most "treacherous" 
features of "bourgeois democracy" and Social Democracy reduced world Communist 
movements to mere guardians of the Soviet Union and an extension of Stalinist 
foreign policy. If anything could justify so abject a role for Communists, it 
was their belief&#8212;held consciously or not&#8212;that Russia was the main force for the 
achievement of world socialism. This doctrinal mystification essentially 
replaced the power of the oppressed to <i>change</i> society and thereby <i>
change themselves</i> in a supreme act of self-empowerment, with the power of a 
"workers' state" to instrumentally <i>redesign</i> society.</p>

<p class="fst">The logic of this mentality had disastrous ramifications, ones 
that exist today even as they did fifty years ago. This Popular Front 
mystification was to turn socialism from a <i>social</i> movement into a largely 
diplomatic one. World Communist Parties which had been spawned in a period of 
authentic revolution were to be denatured by the mythos of a socialism achieved 
by international power politics into mere tools for preserving or abetting the 
interests of a nation-state. The Popular Front, in effect, not only planted 
socialism in a geographical area and divested it of its ethical calling to 
redeem humanity; it rendered the "ideal," with all its visionary and critical 
meanings over the course of history, territorial and invested it with the fixity 
of the "real," notably as a mere instrument of national policy.*</p>

<p class="fst">The argument between the compromised Communist movement of the 
Popular Front and its leftist critics unfolded on a multitude of levels over the 
three tortured years that preceded the Stalin-Hitler pact of 1939. Left 
Socialists generally called it "class collaboration," with blunt clarity; the 
forfeiture of the very sense of revolutionary purpose that alone could defeat 
fascism, much less achieve socialism; the proclivity of liberals to deliver 
democratic liberties to fascists rather than yield power to an insurgent working 
class. Remote as the Popular Front era seems today, it is striking that leftist 
challenges to it have been supported by reality to an uncanny extent.</p>

<p class="fst">In Spain, the victory of the Popular Front in February 1936 
virtually unleashed a revolution by itself. The organizations that orchestrated 
its electoral success allowed a government of liberal mice, marked by timidity 
and a fear of the working class and peasantry, to preside over their destiny. 
The incongruity between the bumbling Azaña regime in Madrid and the wave of 
strikes, rural land seizures, and gun-battles that swept over Spain between 
February and July, when Franco finally "pronounced" against the "Republic," is 
so stark and the logic of events that left only two choices by the summer of 
1936&#8212;either libertarian revolution or bloody authoritarian reaction&#8212;is so 
compelling that Franco's easy success in transporting the "Army of Africa" from 
Spanish Morocco to the mainland was an act of governmental betrayal in its own 
right.</p>

<p class="fst">The CNT placed all its militants on alert and blanketed Barcelona 
with workers patrols, but the other leftist parties which had formed the 
"Popular Front" were essentially quiescent. Even after Franco rose and the 
government attempted to strike a deal with the military, causing people to fill 
the streets demanding arms, the Communist and Socialist Parties jointly 
declared: "It is a difficult, not a desperate time. The government is sure it 
has adequate means to crush this criminal move. Should its means prove 
inadequate, the Republic has the Popular Front's solemn promise. It is ready to 
intervene in the struggle if it is asked to help. The government commands and 
the Popular Front obeys."<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is not the case that no one knew early on that the army 
garrisons would rise&#8212;or, for that matter, when and where. Owing to its excellent 
intelligence service, which had penetrated the military, police, and security 
forces generally, the CNT had warned months in advance that the army was 
planning a coup in the summer of 1936 and that its base would be Spanish 
Morocco. Even more compelling, Colonel Escofet, the Republican police chief of 
Barcelona, had learned from informers and wiretaps that the rising would occur 
on July 19 at 5 A.M., exactly as the conspirators had originally planned, and he 
gave this information to the Catalan and Madrid governments. They met his 
information with disbelief&#8212;not because they regarded a coup as incredible but 
because they could not act upon the information without arming the people. That 
alternative was simply excluded. Indeed, as Escofet later frankly admitted, he 
blandly lied to CNT leaders who came to him demanding arms by "saying they could 
go home since the rising had been postponed."<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The very opposite, in fact, had happened: the rising was pushed 
forward by two days. As early as the morning of July 17, when Franco's aides 
broadcast news of the army rebellion, the naval station near Madrid intercepted 
the report and brought it to the Ministry of the Navy. The only decisive action 
the government took was to conceal it from the people&#8212;indeed, like Escofet, to 
lie by announcing the utterly false story that the uprising in Seville had been 
crushed. The lie was all the more horrendous because thousands of workers in the 
city were being systematically executed by the military after army rebels had 
vanquished them. It was only from popular initiative&#8212;first in Barcelona, where 
the army was defeated after two days of fighting by the combined action of the 
workers and sympathetic Civil Guards, and later in Madrid, Valencia, Málaga, and 
virtually all the major cities in central Spain&#8212;that coordinated resistance 
emerged from the political centers of the country.</p>

<p class="fst">There were no sensational victories by the army and no decisive 
failures by the people. Apart from the Andalusian cities which Franco and his 
generals quickly captured, as often by ruse as by arms, the <i>pronunciamiento</i> 
was essentially a military failure, and the conflict dragged on to its bloody 
conclusion for the greater part of three years. That Franco was able to 
establish himself on the mainland was due to the hesitation of the "Popular 
Front" regime which misled the people; partly because the leftist parties, 
fearful of challenging the government's authority, seemed to be sleepwalking 
through the opening days of the rebellion, and partly because this very 
government was negotiating with the military rather than arming the people. As a 
result, radical urban centers like Seville, Granada, and to the surprise of the 
army itself, Oviedo in Asturias and Saragossa in Aragon, fell to local military 
commanders by sheer ruse because the workers had been kept in ignorance of what 
was happening elsewhere in Spain. The slaughter that occurred in all these 
cities when the army took over initiated a terrible hemorrhaging of the Spanish 
working class and peasantry, a bloodletting that turned Spain into a cemetery 
for more than thirty-five years. As Pierre Broué and Emile Témime conclude in 
their excellent account of the revolution and civil war, "In effect, each time 
that the workers' organizations allowed themselves to be paralyzed by their 
anxiety to respect Republican legality and each time their leaders were 
satisfied with what was said by the officers, the latter prevailed. On the other 
hand, the <i>Movimiento</i> of the generals was repulsed where the workers had 
time to arm and whenever they set about the destruction of the Army as such, 
independently of their leaders' position or the attitude of 'legitimate' public 
authorities."<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There is nothing in this account that a revolutionary socialist 
or anarchist could not have predicted from the day the "Popular Front" came to 
power. The liberals played out their classical role with almost textbook 
exactness. The Socialist Party, divided between a cynical right and an 
irresolute left, was eaten away by indecision and a failure of nerve that 
brought its own conservative chieftains to the point of treachery. Finally, the 
anarchosyndicalist leaders, far less decisive than their rank-and-file 
militants, refused to take power in their Catalan stronghold as a matter of 
principle in the opening weeks of the revolution&#8212;only to compromise their most 
basic antistatist doctrines later by humbly entering the central government as 
ministerial fixtures. Harried by Communist and liberal assaults on the militia 
system and the collectivization, and by an increasingly deadly Stalinist terror, 
the CNT-FAI leadership withdrew into a posture of plaintive clients of the 
"Popular Front," whining rather than fighting against the rollback of the 
revolution that had been the result of a popular movement more than of their own 
efforts.</p>

<p class="fst">But what no one seems to have expected was the resoluteness with 
which the Spanish Communist Party played out its counterrevolutionary role, 
abetted by Soviet weapons, "Comintern" agents, NKVD experts, and in no small 
part, individual members of the "International Brigades," who provided the PCE 
with some of its best assassins. The initial response of the Communists to 
Franco's <i>pronunciamiento</i> was designed to bolster the reputation of the 
liberal government which was trying to come to terms with the insurgent 
generals. More than any organization that professed to be "leftist," the PCE 
opened its doors to the most conservative elements that found themselves behind 
the "Republican" lines, becoming the rallying point for domestic reaction, and 
steadily ate away at the revolution in the name of "antifascism." Not only did 
it try to arrest collectivization, it tried to reverse it , restoring hierarchy 
in the institutions that formed the infrastructure of Spanish life and speaking 
openly for the bourgeois interest in Spanish society. The files of <i>Mundo 
Obrero</i>, the PCE's principal organ, are filled with journalistic 
declamations, manifestos, and editorials that denounce the militias in favor of 
a fully officered "Popular Army," lend support to the liberals and right-wing 
Socialists against criticism by the Socialist left and the anarchists, and 
denounce any exercise of power by the unions and revolutionary committees with 
the cry, "The slogan today is all power and authority to the People's Front 
government" (<i>Daily Worker</i>, September 11, 1936).</p>

<p class="fst">To explain why any self-professed radicals remained in the PCE is 
almost impossible without analyzing the organization's sense of priorities: the 
wishful identification of "socialism" on the part of its more committed members 
with a nation-state, even at the expense of a popular movement that was actively 
emancipatory elsewhere. In this very real sense, the Spanish Communist Party was 
no more Spanish than its Soviet counterpart and as a result of its 
identification of "communism" with Stalin's national policies, no more communist 
than the Catholic Basque movements that opposed Franco.</p>

<p class="fst">The "leftist" government formed by Largo Cabellero in September 
1936 was aimed at mobilizing Socialist, anarchosyndicalist, and Communist 
leaders not only against the army but against the revolution initiated by their 
own rank-and-file. As Largo Caballero attested after he had been removed from 
office, Soviet intervention in Spanish affairs was brutally overt and demanding. 
The revolution was blemishing the Soviet Union's image as a respectable 
nation-state in the pursuit of diplomatic alliances. It had to be stopped. 
Caballero was anything but a revolutionary, but he had a real base in the 
Spanish Socialist Party which gave him enough freedom to act according to his 
own judgment, a fatal flaw in the eyes of the Communists.</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless it was under this regime that the revolution 
expired. On September 30, the "Popular Army" was proclaimed, to the delight of 
the liberals, Communists, and right-wing Socialists; indeed, nearly all parties 
and organizations on the left abetted the transformation of the militias into a 
conventional army. The distribution of weapons, equipment, and resources among 
different sectors of the front and to different regions of the country was 
scandalously governed by political considerations. They were even abandoned to 
Franco if the Communists and their allies suspected they would become available 
to the anarchosyndicalists. To cite one of many examples, Spain's only prewar 
cartridge factory in the "Republican" zone, at Toledo, was permitted to fall 
into the hands of Francoist forces rather than remove it to Barcelona which 
would have strengthened the revolutionary movement&#8212;this, despite pleas by José 
Tarradellas, the deputy of the Catalan premier Luis Companys, who personally 
visited Madrid to present his request for its removal. <a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">

<p class="fst">Reinforced by Soviet arms and the huge membership that it 
acquired largely from the middle classes, the PCE launched an outright assault 
on the collectives and the revolutionary committees, even purging the 
anarchosyndicalists, which <i>Pravda</i>, the organ of the Soviet Communist 
Party, declared "will be conducted with the same energy with which it was 
conducted in the U.S.S.R" (December 17, 1936). "Chekist organizations recently 
discovered in Madrid," warned the anarchosyndicalist newspaper <i>Solidaridad 
Obrera</i> on April 25, 1937, referring to NKVD-type secret prisons and police 
forces "... are directly linked with similar centers under a unified 
leadership and a preconceived plan of national scope." We do not have to go to 
George Orwell, a victim of these "Chekists" (the term applied to the Bolshevik 
secret police during the Russian Revolution), for personal verification of the 
charge. <i>Pravda</i> had already projected the formation of this network, and 
after the war, numerous anarchosyndicalists and POUMists gave detailed accounts 
of their own experiences at the hands of this Communist-controlled system of 
internal repression.</p>

<p class="fst">The decisive point in destroying the popular movement and 
reducing its militants to passivity came in early May 1937, when Catalan 
security forces under the personal command of the Communist commissioner of 
public safety, Salas, tried to seize the CNT-controlled telephone building in 
Barcelona. The attack triggered off a virtual insurrection by the Catalan 
working class, which had been nursing months of grievances against the 
Communists and liberals. Within hours, barricades were raised all over the city, 
and the "Lenin Barracks," the Communist military stronghold, was completely 
surrounded by armed workers. The insurrection spread beyond Barcelona to Lérida, 
where the Civil Guards surrendered their arms to the workers, to Tarragona, 
Gerona, and to militiamen on the Aragon front, who prepared to send detachments 
to the CNT urban centers. The dramatic five days between May 3 and 8, when CNT 
workers could have reclaimed their dwindling revolutionary conquests, were days 
not of defeat but of treachery&#8212;no less by the clique that led the CNT than the 
Communists, who were prepared to create a civil war within the civil war, 
irrespective of its toll on the struggle against the Francoists. Lacking even a 
modicum of this resoluteness, the "anarchist ministers," Montseny and García 
Oliver induced the CNT workers to lay down their arms and return to their homes. 
This self-inflicted defeat turned into an outright rout when superbly armed 
"Republican" assault guards entered Barcelona in force to contain its restive 
population. Barcelona had been turned from the center of the revolution into the 
cowed occupied zone of outright counterrevolution&#8212;at a cost in life, it may be 
noted, comparable to the losses the city had suffered in the army's uprising a 
year earlier.</p>

<p class="fst">The failure of the insurrection&#8212;the famous "May Days"&#8212;opened wide 
the gates of the Communist-led counterrevolution. Largo Caballero was forced to 
resign, replaced by Juan Negrín, who leaned heavily on PCE support up to the 
very end of the war. Two months later, the POUM was officially outlawed, and 
Andres Nín, its most gifted leader, murdered by Soviet agents in collusion with 
Thälmann Battalion members of the International Brigades. The 
anarchosyndicalists, too, suffered heavily, especially with the assassination of 
Carlo Bernieri, the authentic voice of Italian anarchism and a sharp critic of 
the CNT leadership. There is also compelling evidence that members of the 
Garibaldi Battalion of the International Brigades were implicated in his murder 
during the May Days. By August, the notorious Military Investigation Service 
(SIM) was formed under Negrín's premiership to intensify the Stalinist terror 
inflicted on militant anarchosyndicalists and POUM-ists. In the same month, the 
Moscow-trained thug Enrique Líster, led his Communist 11th Division into the 
last rural strongholds of anarchism, where he disbanded the Council of Aragon 
and an indeterminable number of collectives and cowed the revolutionary 
movement, under orders, by his own admission, to "shoot all the anarchists I had 
to."<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> The "Republican" 
government aimed the Belchite campaign, one of the bloodiest in the civil war," 
as much at demolishing the Council of Aragon, that anarchist 
state-within-the-state, as at achieving any significant results against the 
Nationalists," observes David Mitchell in his oral-history accounts of the civil 
war.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thereafter, the "Spanish war," as it was nonchalantly called by a 
bored world in the late 1930s, became nothing but a war&#8212;and a nightmare for the 
Spanish people. Army and people alike were now completely demoralized and 
"utterly pessimistic," observes Josep Costa, a CNT union leader who fought on 
the Aragon front. "The men were like lambs going to a slaughter. There was no 
longer an army, no longer anything. All the dynamic had been destroyed by the 
treachery of the Communist party in the May events. We went through the motions 
of fighting because there was an enemy in front of us. The trouble was that we 
had an enemy behind us too. I saw a comrade lying dead with a wound in the back 
of the neck that couldn't have been inflicted by the Nationalists. We were 
constantly urged to join the Communist party. If you didn't you were in trouble. 
Some men deserted to escape the bullying." That Communist execution squads were 
wandering over battlefields after the troops had pushed forward and were killing 
wounded anarchosyndicalists with their characteristic black-and-red insignia has 
also been told to me by CNT men who participated in the Battle of the Ebro, the 
last of the major "Republican" offensives in the civil war.</p>

<p class="fst">The end of the war on April 1, 1939, did not end the killings. 
Franco systematically slaughtered some 200,000 of his opponents between the time 
of his victory and the early 1940s in a carnage of genocidal proportions that 
was meant to physically uproot the living source of the revolution. No serious 
ideological efforts at conversion were made in the aftermath of the Francoist 
victory. Rather, it was a vindictive counterrevolution that had its only 
parallel, given the population and size of Spain, in Stalin's one-sided civil 
war against the Soviet people.</p>

<p class="fst">A revolutionary civil war of the kind that occurred in Spain is 
no longer possible, in my view, today&#8212;at least, not in the so-called "First 
World." Capitalism itself, as well as the classes that are said to oppose it, 
has changed significantly over the past fifty years. The Spanish workers were 
formed by a cultural clash in which a richly communal world, largely 
precapitalist, was brought into opposition to an industrial economy that had not 
yet pervaded the character structure of the Spanish people. Far from yielding a 
"backward" or "primitive" radical movement, these tensions between past and 
present created an enormously vital one in which the traditions of an older, 
more organic society heightened the critical perceptions and creative élan of a 
large worker-peasant population. The embourgeoisement of the present-day 
proletariat, not to speak of its loss of nerve in the face of a robotic and 
cybernetic technology, are merely evidence of the vastly changed social 
conditions and the overall commodification of society that has occurred since 
1936.</p>

<p class="fst">Military technology, too, has changed. The weapons with which the 
Franco forces and the "Republicans" fought each other seem like toys today, when 
neutron bombs can be at the service of a completely ruthless ruling class. Force 
alone can no longer oppose force with any hope of revolutionary success. On this 
score, the greatest power lies with the rulers of society, not with the ruled. 
Only the hollowing out of the coercive institutions in the prevailing society, 
such as occurred in Portugal fairly recently and certainly in the Great French 
Revolution of two centuries ago&#8212;where the old society, divested of all support, 
collapsed at the first thrust&#8212;can yield radical social change. The barricade is 
a symbol, not a physical bulwark. To raise it denotes resolute intent at best&#8212;it 
is not a means to achieve change by insurrection. Perhaps the most lasting 
physical resistance the Spanish workers and peasants could have organized, even 
with Franco's military successes, would have been guerrilla warfare, a form of 
struggle whose very name and greatest traditions during modern times are 
Spanish. Yet none of the parties and organizations in the "Republican" zone 
seriously contemplated guerrilla warfare. Instead, conventional armies opposed 
conventional armies largely in trenches and as columns, until Franco's plodding 
strategy and overwhelming superiority of supplies swept his opponents from the 
field.</p>

<p class="fst">Could revolutionary warfare have defeated Franco? By this I mean 
a truly political war which sought to capture the hearts of the Spanish people, 
even that of the international working class, which exhibited a measure of class 
consciousness and solidarity that seems monumental by present-day standards. 
This presupposes the existence of working-class organizations that minimally 
would not have been a burden on the awakened people of Spain&#8212;and hopefully, 
would have contributed to the popular impetus. Given these conditions, my answer 
would be yes, as proved to be the case in Barcelona at the beginning, where 
Franco's army was defeated earlier than elsewhere. Franco's forces, which failed 
to gain victories in central Spain's major cities, could have been kept from 
taking such key radical centers as Seville, Córdoba, Oviedo, and Saragossa&#8212;the 
latter two of strategic importance, linking the most industrialized urban 
regions of Spain, the Basque country, and Catalonia. But the regime temporized 
with the aid of the "Popular Front" parties&#8212;particularly the Communists and 
right-wing Socialists&#8212;while confused workers in these key cities fell victim in 
almost every case to military ruses, not combat. With far greater determination 
than its enemies, the military drove a wedge between the Basques and Catalans 
that the "Popular Army" never overcame.</p>

<p class="fst">Even so, Franco's forces stalled significantly at various times 
in the war, such that Hitler expected his "crusade" to fail.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> 
The death blow to popular resistance was delivered by the Communist Party, which 
was willing to risk the collapse of the entire war effort in its program to 
dissolve the largely libertarian revolution&#8212;one which had tried, faintheartedly 
enough, to come to a modus vivendi with its opponents on the "left." But no such 
understanding was possible: the PCE sought to make the "Spanish war" respectable 
primarily in the Soviet Union's interests and to cloak itself for all the 
democratic world to see in the trappings of bourgeois virtue. The revolution had 
tarnished this image and challenged the explicitly counterrevolutionary function 
which the entire Communist International had adopted in the service of Soviet 
diplomacy. Hence not only did the Spanish Revolution have to be exterminated, 
its exterminators had to be seen as such. The "Reds" had to be regarded as a 
safe bet by London, Paris, and Washington&#8212;and they gradually were as the 
conflict in Spain came to an end.</p>

<p class="fst">By the time the war was internationalized by unstinting German 
and Italian aid to Franco and the Soviet Union's highly conditional and limited 
assistance to the "Republicans"&#8212;in exchange, I may add, for Spain's sizable gold 
reserves&#8212;revolutionary victory was impossible. The May Days could have produced 
a "Catalan Commune," a sparkling legacy on which the Spanish people could have 
nourished their hopes for future struggles. It might even have become an 
inspiration for radical movements throughout the world. But the CNT, already 
partly bureaucratized in 1936, became appallingly so by 1937, with the 
acquisition of buildings, funds, presses, and other material goodies. This 
reinforced and rigidified the top-down hierarchical structure that is endemic to 
syndicalist organization. With the May Days, the union's ministerial elite 
completely arrested the revolution and acted as an outright obstacle to its 
advance in later moments of crisis.</p>

<p class="fst">The Communist Party of Spain won all its demands for an army, 
decollectivization, the extermination of its most dangerous opponents, the 
Stalinization of the internal security forces, and the conversion of the social 
revolution into a "war against fascism"&#8212;and it lost the war completely. Soviet 
aid, selective and unreliable at best, came to an end in November 1938, nearly a 
half-year before Franco's victory, while Italian and German aid continued up to 
the end. When Stalin moved toward a pact with Hitler, he found the "Spanish war" 
an embarrassment and simply denied it further support. The "Western democracies" 
did nothing for "Republican" Spain despite that regime's success in suppressing 
internal revolution and its Western-oriented policy in international affairs. 
Thus, it denied Spanish Morocco, a major reservoir of Franco's troops, the 
independence that might have turned it against the rebel army, despite promises 
by Moroccan nationalists of support.</p>

<p class="fst">What was lost in Spain was the most magnificent proletariat that 
radical movements had ever seen either before or after 1936-39&#8212;a classical 
working class in the finest socialist and anarchist sense of the term. It was a 
proletariat that was destroyed not by a growing material interest in bourgeois 
society but by physical extermination. This occurred largely amidst a conspiracy 
of silence by the international press in which the liberal establishment played 
no less a role than the Communist. It is appalling that Herbert M. Matthews, the <i>
New York Times's</i> principal correspondent on the so-called "Loyalist" side of 
the war, could write as recently as 1973,"I would say that there was a 
revolution of sorts, but it should not be exaggerated. In one basic sense, there 
was no revolution at all, since the republican government functioned much as it 
did before the war."<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> Whether 
this is stupidity or collusion with the forces that ended the "revolution of 
sorts," I shall leave for the reader to judge. But it was correspondents of this 
political temper who fed news of the "Spanish war" to the American people in the 
1930s.</p>

<p class="fst">The literature that deals with the conflict, generally more 
forthright than what was available for years after the war, has grown 
enormously, supported by oral historians of considerable ability. Has the 
American left learned from these accounts or from the Spanish collectives, 
industrial as well as agricultural, which offer dramatic alternative models of 
revolutionary modernization to the conventional ones based on nationalized 
economies and centralized, often totalitarian, control? My answer would have to 
be a depressing no. The decline of the "New Left" and the emergence of a more 
"orthodox" one threatens to create a new myth of the "Popular Front" as a golden 
era of radicalism. One would suppose that the new material on Spain, largely 
left-wing in orientation, has been read by no one. The "Spanish war" is no 
longer cloaked in silence, but the facts are being layered over with a sweet 
sentimentality for the aging survivors of the "Lincoln Battalion" and the 
Mom-Pop stereotypes in films like <i>Seeing Red</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The truth, indeed, is out&#8212;but the ears to hear it and the minds 
to learn from it seem to have been atrophied by a cultivated ignorance and a 
nearly total loss of critical insight. "Partyness" has replaced politics, 
mindless "loyalty" has replaced theory, "balance" in weighing the facts has 
replaced commitment, and an ecumenical "radicalism" that embraces Stalinists and 
reformists under the shredded banner of "unity" and "coalition" has replaced the 
integrity of ideas and practice. That the banner of "unity" and "coalition" 
became Spain's shroud and was used with impunity to destroy its revolution and 
risk delivering the country to Franco is as remote from the collective wisdom of 
the left today as it was fifty years ago in the cauldron of a bloody civil war.</p>

<p class="fst">Ultimately, the integrity of the Spanish left could be preserved 
only if it articulated the most deep-seated traditions of the Spanish people: 
their strong sense of community, their traditions of confederalism and local 
autonomy, and their profound mistrust of the state. Whether the American left 
shares with the Spanish left the popular legacy that the latter cleansed and 
rescued from the right is a crucial problem that cannot be discussed here. But 
insofar as the anarchists gave these traditions coherence and a radical thrust, 
converting them into a political <i>culture</i>, not merely a contrived 
"program," they survived generations of incredible persecution and repression. 
Indeed, only when the Socialists resolved the problem of the relationship 
between a political movement and a popular one by establishing their famous 
"houses of the people" or <i>casas del pueblo</i> in Spain's villages, 
neighborhoods, and cities did they become a vital movement in Spanish life and 
politics.</p>

<p class="fst">The "Popular Front" ruptured this relationship by replacing a 
popular culture with the "politics" of backroom "coalitions." The utterly 
disparate parties that entered into "coalitions" were united solely by their 
shared fear of the popular movement and of Franco. The left's need to deal with 
its own relationship to popular traditions which have a latent radical 
content&#8212;to cleanse these traditions and bring out their emancipatory 
aspirations&#8212;remains a legacy of the Spanish Civil War that has not been 
earnestly confronted, either by anarchists or by socialists. Until the need to 
form a political culture is clearly defined and given the centrality it 
deserves, the Spanish Revolution will remain not only one of the most 
inexplicable chapters of radical history but the conscience of the radical 
movement as a whole.</p>
