<h3>The Steps Toward World Trade Union Unity</h3>

<hr class="base" size="1">
<h5>Chapter V</h5>
<h2>The Red International of Labor Unions and World Trade Union Unity</h2>

<p class="indent">REGARDLESS of nationality, race, color and political and religious creeds, the working class has always been inspired by one idea&#8212;the overthrow of capitalist society, built on slavery, exploitation and violence. In this struggle of labor against capital, the working class can win only by mustering all their forces against the common enemy, bound in one strong proletarian organization. This is why for the working class, in order to save itself from economic enslavement and from the menace of war&#8212;unity is imperative.
</p>
<p class="indent">This is why the delegation of the trade unions of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, at the mutual conference with the British trade unions, not only understood the task before them, but showed such firm will for the establishment of unity in the international labor movement.
</p>
<p>
In these few words, M. Tomsky, secretary of the Central Council of the Russian Trade Unions, sets forth the objective of the movement for world trade union unity&#8212;against the economic enslavement of the workers by capital and new imperialist wars.
</p>
<p>
For this objective the 11,000,000 trade unionists of Britain and Russia have united in the movement for world trade union unity, thru the formation of the Anglo-Russian Unity Committee. This Anglo-Russian Unity Committee has become the organizing center of the movement for world trade union unity. The officialdoms of most of the other trade union movements, including the American trade union movement, are hostile to this movement, and fight it in co-operation with the bosses and their agencies.
</p>
<p>
Organizationally this movement demands the convocation of a world congress of trade unionists to establish a united trade union international and decide upon a program for combatting the economic enslavement of the workers by capitalism and against new imperialist wars. No preliminary conditions are laid down to which any trade union has to subscribe prior to this world congress provided that they want unity.
</p>
<p>
The self-evident facts of the present situation in which the working class finds itself will determine the program and tactics of this congress. That the program will be based on class warfare against capitalism is evident&#8212;if the right wing leaders of the Amsterdam International thought that such a world congress of trade unionists would support their policy of co-operation with the capitalists they would favor the holding of such a congress. But because they know that a world congress of trade unionists really representing the rank and file of the trade unions would reject their class-collaboration policy they do their utmost to prevent the holding of such a congress.
</p>
<p>
The first meeting of the Anglo-Russian Unity Committee was held in April, 1925, in London. There the unity of the British and Russian trade unionists was cemented in the movement for trade union unity. A joint declaration was drawn up at this conference which sets forth the real necessity for unity of the trade union movement of the world. Every honest and intelligent worker will admit that the following paragraphs strike at the root of the question of trade union unity&#8212;and establish the imperative necessity for the achievement of that unity:
</p>
<p class="indent">So long as the capitalist system continues there is danger of war. The merciless struggle for supremacy between the conflicting vested interests of competing groups of exploiters will, as in the past, eventually evoke a new crisis, plunging the workers of the world into another disastrous war.
</p>
<p class="indent">There is but one power that can save mankind from being plunged into another universal catastrophe. There is but one power which can defend the workers of all countries against political and economic oppression and tyranny. There is but one power which can bring freedom, welfare, happiness and peace to the working class and to humanity. That power is the working class if well organized, properly disciplined, self-devoted and determined to fight all who would oppose and prevent its complete emancipation.
</p>
<p>
The meeting of the Anglo-Russian Unity Committee held after the Scarborough meeting of the British Trades Union Congress constituted the committee as the organizing center for the movement for world trade union unity. No longer is it a question of attempting to force the reactionary right wing Amsterdam leaders to agree to trade union unity. They have shown plainly that they will agree to unity on one basis only&#8212;that the trade union movement shall not fight the capitalists on an international scale. Otherwise they fight unity.
</p>
<p>
The Anglo-Russian Unity Committee has the task of mobilizing the trade unionists of the world to achieve unity&#8212;the establishing of a single trade union international to combat the capitalists. This is being accomplished in no uncertain manner, and the growing number of unions that have endorsed the idea of trade union unity, and the Anglo-Russian Unity Committee, shows that the rank and file of the trade unions are for unity and are moving towards it in spite of reactionary leaders and all the agencies of capitalism.
</p>
<p>
The following partial list of trade unions, and mass meetings of workers that have endorsed trade union unity and the establishment of the Anglo-Russian Unity Committee will show to what an extent the movement for world trade union unity has grown:
</p>
<p>
<strong>France:</strong> The French trade union movement was split three years ago and the split has been maintained by the leaders of the General Confederation of Labor, Jouhaux and Merrheim, who are at the same time leaders of the right wing of the Amsterdam International. The left wing United General Confederation of Labor has repeatedly made overtures for unity of the movement but these have been rejected by the reactionaries of the General Confederation of Labor. Both federations have half a million workers organized. The United General Confederation of Labor, affiliated with the R. I. L. U., has endorsed international trade union unity and the formation of the Anglo-Russian Unity Committee. It is initiating joint meetings of workers of both federations on the unity question. Local unions of railroaders, metal workers, teachers, miners, butchers, civil servants, etc., have voiced the demand for unity both nationally and internationally.
</p>
<p>
Joint meetings of trade unionists belonging to both federations are being held. Such a meeting held at Lille is typical of this movement where, after endorsing the campaign of the left wing federation for unity in France, the resolution continues:
</p>
<p class="indent">Considering the praiseworthy efforts of the British trade unions which have resulted in an agreement with the Russian unions on the question of international unity, the meeting declares its approval of this action of the British trade unionists, and asks the C. G. T. trade unionists of France to adopt the same attitude as the British in the question of international unity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Germany:</strong> The German General Federation of Trade Unions (A. D. G. B.) had about 11,000,000 members at the time of the 1918 revolution. At the last congress held this year about 4,000,000 membership was reported. The leaders of the A. D. G. B. (Leipart, Grossman, Tarnow and Co.) are the finest servants the German capitalists have. They have preached and practiced co-operation between capital and labor both during the war and since. The workers&#8217; revolution of 1918-19 was defeated largely because of opposition of these leaders. The entire apparatus of the trade unions was placed at the disposal of the capitalists. The mighty struggles of the German workers have been opposed by the leaders, strikes broken and sold out, left wing workers and Communists betrayed to the police&#8212;all to help the German capitalists. The French invasion of the Ruhr in 1923 was not opposed by these leaders. The Dawes plan is supported by them even tho is has turned the German workers into European &#8220;coolies,&#8221; turned the eight-hour day into a 10- 12- and 14-hour day, and increased the exploitation of the German workers terribly with the result that in the western capitalist countries the bosses demand wage reductions because of the competition of &#8220;cheap German labor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Against these traitorous leaders the trade union members have revolted time and again with the result that individual and mass expulsions have been resorted to. The election of a worker to an office in a local union who does not bow the knee to the traitor policy of the leaders results in his expulsion. But in spite of this, and because of the compulsion of the terrible conditions under which the workers labor, trade union unity is supported by thousands of trade unionists. The metal workers, wood workers, municipal employes and transport workers have passed resolutions in many centers demanding unity. The Berlin local of the Metal Workers&#8217; Union, the largest union local in the city, unanimously passed a resolution at a general meeting held in July demanding that the German Trade Union Federation Executive Council
</p>
<p class="indent"> . . . propose to the I. F. T. U. that all trade union organizations of the world, regardless of whether they are at present affiliated to any trade union international or not, be united into a single trade union international. The executives of the I. F. T. U. (Amsterdam), and of the R. I. L. U. (Moscow), shall in joint conference decide upon the manner and composition of a world congress to be convened for that purpose.
</p>
<p>
The recent visit of a delegation of German workers to Soviet Russia has had the effect, not only of strengthening the bonds between the German workers and the workers&#8217; republic, but of increasing the movement for world trade union unity among the German trade unionists. This delegation of workers, not trade union officials, saw for themselves the power of the Soviet republic, the growing betterment of the conditions of the workers, and the strength of the Russian trade unions. They will enlighten their fellow workers to the lies of the trade union bureaucrats against the workers&#8217; republic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Belgium:</strong> The Belgian workers were used by the Allies in the first days of the world war to stop the German advance on Paris and the Channel ports. King Albert is praised for this, and Emil Vandervelde, leader of the Belgian labor party, has become a member of the Belgian cabinet. The leader of the Belgian Trades Union Commission is Mertens, prominent in the fight against unity led by the right wing Amsterdamers.
</p>
<p>
Last February the Belgian Clothing Workers&#8217; Union sent two fraternal delegates to the Russian Clothing Workers&#8217; Union convention. One of the delegates, Liebaerts, secretary of the union, writes:
</p>
<p class="indent">Like the British trade union delegation, we returned from the New Russia firmly convinced of the possibility and necessity of realizing trade union unity with our Russian comrades. Our report and conclusions have been unanimously approved (with one hostile vote only) by our national committee.
</p>
<p>
C. Mahlman, secretary of the Belgian Transport Workers&#8217; Union, writes:
</p>
<p class="indent">We are convinced that in Belgium also unity with the Russian trade unions would meet with approval and welcome.
</p>
<p>
The Brussels local of the Belgian Teachers&#8217; Union unanimously resolved that
</p>
<p class="indent"> . . . . We beg all working class organizations to work for the reestablishment of trade union unity, and with this in view, to support the efforts of the Anglo-Russian Council.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Norway:</strong> The Norwegian Federation of Trade Unions at its meeting in September approved of the movement for trade union unity, and decided to apply for admission to the Anglo-Russian Unity Committee to aid in the work. The National Conference of Trades Councils held in the same month passed a resolution which says is part:
</p>
<p class="indent">The conference entirely supports the endeavors of the British and Russian trade unions and of the R. I. L. U. for the summoning of an international trade union unity congress. . . The conference appeals to all organized workers to support these endeavors for a united trade union international.
</p>
<p>
From the other European countries the trade unionists are raising their voices demanding trade union unity. The Czecho-Slovak One Big Union with a membership of a quater of a million, affiliated with the R. I. L. U. supports world trade union unity. In Spain, Italy, Sweden, Denmark and Jugo-Slavia the trade unionists are rallying to the support of unity.
</p>
<p>
In South America unions in Brazil, Uruguay, and Mexico support unity. At Montevideo, Uruguay, the journal of the Printing Trades Unions, El Obrero Grafico says:
</p>
<p class="indent">The question of trade union unity is not simply a European question. It should also be discussed in other countries. To deny that the Uruguayan workers have any interest in this question would mean working against unity.
</p>
<p>
In Canada the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Employes, at its convention in October, went on record for international trade union unity. Local unions of machinists, etc., have also done likewise.
</p>
<p>
In the United States the Capmakers&#8217; International Union at its convention last April unanimously endorsed international trade union unity. Local unions of miners, painters, clothing workers have voiced their support for this movement. The officials of the A. F. of L. and the Railroad Brotherhoods are opposed to unity. Green &amp; Co. will support the right wing of the Amsterdam in the fight against unity. If the A. F. of L. affiliates with Amsterdam it will be to take over the leadership in the struggle against unity to protect the investments of American capital and aid the American imperialists to extend the Dawes plan to other European countries.
</p>
<p>
The rank and file trade unionists of this country are faced with the alternative of lining up with the trade unionists of other countries to fight the capitalists or to be led by Green &amp; Co. against their fellow workers who are fighting against the Dawes plan, against swelling the coffers of the House of Morgan.
