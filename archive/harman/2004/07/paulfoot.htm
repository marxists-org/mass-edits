<p class="fst">Paul was a brilliant socialist writer, a speaker more able than any other to make people see what was wrong with capitalism, a tireless campaigner against injustice, and an investigative journalist whose revelations caused the resignation of a Tory cabinet minister and exposed the corruption of businessmen, big and small.</p>

<p>He became a revolutionary socialist when he was a young journalist working on Scotland&#8217;s <strong>Daily Record</strong>.</p>

<p>He came from a privileged background. His father was governor of British-run Palestine and then British-run Cyprus, and Paul attended Shrewsbury public school, joining the Liberals when he was at Oxford University.</p>

<p>It was contact with the realities of working class life and the working class movement in Glasgow in the early 1960s that transformed his ideas. He was never to look back.</p>

<p>Within a couple of years he was editing the precursor of <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, <strong>Labour Worker</strong>, and then went on to write three devastating books.</p>

<p><strong>Immigration and Race in British Politics</strong> detailed the scapegoating of successive generations of immigrants, from East European Jews in the 1890s to Afro-Caribbeans and Asians in the early 1960s.</p>

<p><strong>The Politics of Harold Wilson</strong> tore apart the record of the Labour government elected in 1964. And <strong>The Rise of Enoch Powell</strong> showed how the political establishment &#8211; including Labour &#8211; capitulated to the racism of the far right.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Paul was also exposing the faulty evidence that had led to the hanging of James Hanratty for murder in 1961.</p>

<p>In his fortnightly column in <strong>Private Eye</strong> he began an investigation into the network of corruption around the systems-building of high rise flats.</p>

<p>This led to the jailing of Labour&#8217;s Newcastle supremo T. Dan Smith, and the resignation of Tory home secretary Reginald Maudling.</p>

<p>He was at the heart of the wave of struggle of the 1970s, from the occupation of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders in 1971 through the miners&#8217; strike of 1974.</p>

<p>It was then that he began a six-year spell working full time on <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>.</p>

<p>He used his journalistic skills to bring the spirit of the struggle into the paper, to show the machinations of the upper classes, and to convey socialist ideas in a language that was accessible to people who had never come across them before.</p>

<p>His book <strong>Why You Should Be a Socialist</strong> took the message to thousands of people.</p>

<p>His energy did not flag with the downturn of the struggle in the late 1970s.</p>

<p>He was with the miners when they were driven down to defeat in 1984-5 just as much as he had been with them when they were victorious ten years earlier.</p>

<p>His weekly page in the <strong>Daily Mirror</strong> of the 1980s became a beacon of light in the dark Thatcher years.</p>

<p>It ensured that the meetings he did in all parts of the country, often two or three times a week, always got an enthusiastic audience.</p>

<p>When a new management purged left wing journalists from the <strong>Daily Mirror</strong> in 1992, Paul was in the forefront of those putting up resistance and lost his job as a result.</p>

<p>His journalism in these years exposed one of the great miscarriages of justice &#8211; the case of four men convicted of &#8220;the murder on the farm&#8221; of Carl Bridgewater.</p>

<p>It also brought to light the amazing story of how Colin Wallace was used by British intelligence in Northern Ireland to smear the 1974 Labour government and then framed for a killing in a south coast town.</p>

<p>Paul was first taken ill five years ago, and that reduced his capacity to speak at meetings.</p>

<p>But his commitment continued, with a fortnightly political column in the <strong>Guardian</strong> and a fortnightly page in <strong>Private Eye</strong>.</p>

<p>He ran for mayor of Hackney as the Socialist Alliance candidate 18 months ago, and stood on the list for the London Assembly as a Respect candidate last month.</p>

<p>Just a fortnight ago he was promising to resume his regular column in <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, and just a week ago he had an audience spellbound at the Marxism festival of socialist ideas as he laid into New Labour.</p>

<p>He will be missed by everyone on the left, by every active trade unionist, by every opponent of racism, and by everyone who simply wants a better society.</p>
