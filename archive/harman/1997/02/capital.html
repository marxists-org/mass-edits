<p class="fst"><strong>Collected Works</strong>, Vol.35: <strong>Capital</strong>, Vol.1<br />
Karl Marx and Frederick Engels<br />
<em>Lawrence &amp; Wishart &#163;45</em></p>

<p class="fst">This volume brings closer to completion one of the most ambitious and rewarding publishing ventures of the century &#8211; the production in a uniform edition of everything that Marx and Engels ever wrote, for the first time enabling English speaking readers to study in depth the development and ramifications of their ideas.</p>

<p>But this particular volume is not the best buy if you simply want to get hold of <strong>Capital</strong>. It reprints a translation that has long been available, more cheaply, from Lawrence and Wishart, with the one addition of a chapter Marx himself decided not to publish but which is available elsewhere.</p>

<p>The translation was carried out just over a century ago under the personal supervision of Frederick Engels by his friend Samuel Moore, and Edward Aveling, for many years the partner of Marx&#8217;s daughter Eleanor. A second translation was made in the 1920s by Eden and Cedar Paul and published by Everyman, but was in no way an improvement on Moore/Aveling. Finally, in the 1970s, Penguin produced yet a third translation, by Ben Foulkes.</p>

<p>Foulkes claimed he produced his translation to update the English in the Moore/Aveling translations and to restore some of &#8216;the German philosophical terms repeatedly used by Marx&#8217;. Foulkes complains Moore and Aveling &#8216;watered down&#8217; these on the advice of Engels so as to make the work more popular with an English speaking readership.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Foulkes himself did not improve on the Moore/Aveling edition any more than the Pauls did. Comparing text for text, the Moore/Aveling one flows marginally better. As for Engels&#8217; alleged popularisation, it was Marx himself who amended the first German edition so as to make the work more accessible to workers intent on obtaining a serious scientific understanding. And some of Foulkes&#8217; translations in fact obscure rather than clarify &#8211; as when he translates the German verb meaning &#8216;to expand in value&#8217; by a French word which does not exist in English, &#8216;valorisation&#8217;, rather than the absolute clear expression used by Moore, with Engels&#8217; assistance, &#8216;the self expansion of value&#8217;. The issue is not trivial, since for Marx &#8216;self expansion of value&#8217; is the motive that leads capital to enter into production, and to translate this as &#8216;valorisation&#8217; is to mystify the process completely.</p>

<p>What is more, Foulkes&#8217;s habit of putting the original German in brackets at various points can simply add to the widespread prejudice that Capital is an intrinsically difficult work to understand &#8211; although, in fact, it is much easier to follow than virtually any standard textbook of bourgeois economics.</p>

<p>There are two abbreviated editions of <strong>Capital</strong> which attempt to make it easier still &#8211; an OUP paperback edition by the non-Marxist Marx expert David McLellan and a <strong>Student&#8217;s Capital</strong> from Lawrence and Wishart by the Marxist Chris Arthur. Both prune sections of the Moore/Aveling translation. Arthur also removes the footnotes, while McLellan puts them in an appendix.</p>

<p>Some people argue that any cutting back of Marx&#8217;s text is sacrilege and has to be opposed. The omitted passages and footnotes are important to anybody who wants to study the development of Marx&#8217;s thought in relation to the 18th and 19th century tradition of &#8216;classical&#8217; political economy. But they do tend to bog down readers not acquainted with a tradition that is rarely taught today.</p>

<p>Both editors do succeed in making the task of approaching <strong>Capital</strong> a little easier. But Arthur&#8217;s introduction is not for the first timer, since it adopts a philosophic language that many will find difficult to follow, whereas the non-Marxist McLellan does outline quite well what Marx attempted to do.</p>

<p>Welcome the Collected Works edition of <strong>Capital</strong> as part of a great scholarly enterprise. But shop elsewhere if you want to get hold of the book for the first time.</p>
