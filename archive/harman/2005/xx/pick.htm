<p class="fst">The last two issues of <strong>New Left Review</strong> have contained some unusually interesting material. Susan Watkins (<strong>NLR&nbsp;33</strong>, May&#8211;June) provides a very useful analysis of the background to the attempt to push through the neo-liberal European constitution. She explains what is at stake for Europe&#8217;s rulers, although in my view she is a bit dismissive of the contradictory interests of the European and US ruling classes. Giovanni Arrighi&#8217;s piece in the same issue, <em>Hegemony Unravelling &#8211; 2</em>, the second instalment in a two-part article, is more perceptive on this question. He highlights the importance of the rise of China for the world system despite (like many &#8216;world system&#8217; theorists) projecting the history of capitalism back into the middle ages by identifying it with finance, rather than the exploitation of waged labour at the point of production.</p>

<p>Readers who want to find out about the background to the crisis of the Lula government in Brazil should look at Emir Sadir&#8217;s <em>Taking Lula&#8217;s Measure</em> (<a href="http://www.newleftreview.net/NLR26706.shtml" target="new">www.newleftreview.net/NLR26706.shtml</a>) and Lecio Morais and Alfredo Saad-Filho&#8217;s <em>Lula and the Continuity of Neoliberalism in Brazil</em> in <strong>Historical Materialism 2005:1</strong> (available at <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/hm/2005/00000013/00000001/art00001" target="new">www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/hm/2005/00000013/00000001/art00001</a>).</p>

<p>Continuing its recent interesting coverage on China, <strong>NLR&nbsp;34</strong> contains an interview with Han Dongfang, a worker activist involved in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 who now broadcasts into China from Hong Kong on workers&#8217; struggles. He talks about his experiences and some of the struggles taking place today (<a href="http://www.newleftreview.net/NLR26803.shtml" target="new">www.newleftreview.net/NLR26803.shtml</a>). In the same issue Tsering Shakya offers a useful short review of the biography of the Tibetan Communist leader Phuntso Wangye by Melvyn Goldstein, Dawei Sherap and Sillian Siebenschuh. Phuntso Wangye was imprisoned for 18 years by Mao.</p>

<p>Also in this issue of <strong>NLR</strong>, Andrew Glyn provides a mass of information on the world economy in <em>Global Balances</em>. His figures on the relative productivity of European and US industry differ from those given elsewhere (for instance in the book by Levy and Dum&#233;nil reviewed earlier in this issue).</p>

<p>September&#8217;s <strong>Monthly Review</strong> contains two articles which readers might find a helpful complement to pieces in this journal &#8211; Ingo Schmidt on the crisis in Germany&#8217;s labour movement and Jeffery R. Weber on Bolivia.</p>

<p>Readers who enjoyed our articles on Africa in the last <strong>International Socialism</strong> will find very useful the piece by David Seddon and Leo Zeilig in the <strong>Review of African Political Economy</strong> entitled <em>Class and Protest in Africa</em>.</p>

<p>May&#8217;s <strong>Sociological Review</strong> contains an interesting attempt by Andrew Smith to locate the rise of &#8216;post-colonial&#8217; literature in the material conditions facing many Third World authors. Using examples from Nigeria, his <em>Bringing the Story Home</em> argues that the market for literature leads authors to seek acclaim from Western audiences and so become &#8216;alienated&#8217; from their local roots.</p>

<p>The summer issue of <strong>Capital and Class</strong> contains an interesting review of Michael Hardt and Toni Negri&#8217;s <strong>Empire</strong> from a strange source. The author, Paul Thompson, was a leading member of Britain&#8217;s own semi-autonomist organisation, Big Flame, in the 1970s. He moved via the Labour Coordinating Committee of the early 1980s to the New Labour magazine <strong>Renewal</strong> in the late 1990s, before recoiling faced with the reality of Blairism. He is able to make a number of coherent criticisms of the book (complete with a positive endorsement of points made by Alex Callinicos), despite continuing to find fault with revolutionary Marxism.</p>
