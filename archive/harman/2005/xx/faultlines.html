<p class="fst">This summer saw the clear emergence of another faultline in the
world system, alongside those caused by the Bush government&#8217;s
inability to crush the resistance in Iraq, and the rising wave of
revolt in Latin America. The new faultline is in Western Europe. It
is the subject of the opening section of this journal.</p>
<p>A decade ago a general swing to the left voted out conservative
governments in Italy, France, Britain and Germany, but brought to
power Third Way social democrats committed to a neo-liberalism that
soon disillusioned many of their most active supporters. Now there
are signs of new, widespread political dissent as the pressure on
European capitalism from competition in global markets is pushing
governments towards even harder versions of the neo-liberal agenda,
with attacks on pensions and unemployment benefits and demands for
longer working hours.</p>

<p>The &#8216;No&#8217; vote in the French referendum and the election
results in Germany have thrown their political establishments into
turmoil. In France the conservative right is split down the middle,
as former interior minister Sarkozy challenges Chirac, warning that
&#8216;I&#8217;m not going to quietly mend locks at Versailles while a revolt
is brewing in France.&#8217; The Socialist Party is as badly split,
caught between a majority leadership which wants to continue with the
policies of the past, and dissidents who know that 70 percent of the
party&#8217;s supporters voted no in the referendum. This, argues Stathis
Kouv&#233;lakis in our first article, constitutes a qualitative change in
the situation and an unparalleled opportunity for the revolutionary
left, not only in France but across the continent as a whole.</p>

<p>Germany is still the economic powerhouse of the continent &#8211; and
was a source of political stability at the time of eruption in
France, Italy, Portugal and Spain in the late 1960s and 1970s. Stefan
Bornost shows, in an article written on the eve of the 18 September
elections, how that stability has been undermined, with revolt from
within the ranks of social democracy giving birth to an electoral
intervention from a new left.</p>

<p>The faultline extends beyond France and Germany. Pepijn Brandon
points to similarities between the mood in the Dutch referendum and
that in France. Jane Hardy and Andy Zebrowski show that some of the
same feeling exists now even in Poland, the biggest of the &#8216;new
Europe&#8217; states aligned internationally with Bush and Blair. And we
recall the 25th anniversary of the Solidarity revolt, which dealt the
first stunning blow to the old Stalinist order throughout Eastern
Europe. Ian Taylor hears from activists in the working heartland of
London&#8217;s East End how the new Respect coalition was able to give
political expression to the bitterness against Tony Blair.</p>

<p>The Latin American faultline first came to light with the uprising
which drove out the Ecuadorian president in January 2001. Since then
further risings have removed presidents in Argentina, Ecuador (for a
second time) and Bolivia (twice), as well as thwarting the April 2002
coup against Ch√°vez in Venezuela. The recent uprising in Bolivia was
in some ways the most far-reaching yet. Mike Gonzalez provides an
exhaustive analysis of the forces involved in the revolt, showing how
at the key moment it raised the whole question of which class ruled
the country &#8211; a question which was not finally resolved in June and
which will return again in the months ahead.</p>

<p>Brazil, the biggest South American country, with half the
population and the most powerful economy, has so far avoided the
upsurge of militancy seen elsewhere. Until recently it seemed
stabilised as the Lula government, elected with working class votes
three years ago, followed ultraorthodox Third Way policies. Over the
summer that government has been much weakened, not by mass struggle,
but by a series of revelations about corruption going right to the
heart of the Workers&#8217; Party. Three revolutionary activists from Sao
Paulo analyse the political crisis and suggest the way forward for
the new left grouped in the PSOL party.</p>

<p>Finally, the Iraq faultline continues to threaten instability at
the very heart of the system. The Bush administration&#8217;s attempt to
reinforce US hegemony for the rest of the &#8216;new century&#8217; is
threatening to undermine that hegemony with consequences neither it
nor we can foresee. What is clear is that the war will produce
political explosions, often when they are least expected &#8211; as with
the impact of the suicide bombings in London, Bush&#8217;s new threats
against Iran, the revival of the US anti-war movement, and the way
the resources poured into the war deepened the anger over the New
Orleans floods. The way the war feeds into other issues is shown by
the perplexity of the Bush administration faced with the revolts in
US imperialism&#8217;s traditional bloody playground in Latin America,
and the way the German Social Democrats were able to use the war as a
weapon in an effort to regain ground in the elections.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Theory, clarity and practice</h4>

<p class="fst">Three faultlines do not make a revolutionary situation. For that
many other factors are necessary. One is clarity on the left about
its analyses of the world. On the left internationally there is
considerable confusion when it comes to analysing the motives that
drove the Bush administration to launch its &#8216;war on terror&#8217;. Alex
Callinicos follows up the arguments in his book, <b>The New Mandarins
of American Power</b>, with a critical discussion on some of the
other interpretations of imperialism today.</p>

<p>Among sections of the anti-imperialist movement there is still a
degree of suspicion of Marxism, fed by the postmodernist,
post-colonial academic currents of the 1980s and 1990s. One source of
the suspicion is the misreading of Marx by Edward Said in his
influential book <b>Orientalism</b>. The noted Indian historian Irfan
Habib challenges Said&#8217;s approach.</p>

<p>Another question about which clarity is all-important is that of
what socialism means in the aftermath of the collapse of Stalinism.
The Argentinian economist Claudio Katz (whose analysis of Latin
America&#8217;s centre-left governments was in our last issue) has
recently produced a book, <b>El Porvenir del Socialismo</b> (<b>The
Future of Socialism</b>) on this. Chris Harman takes a friendly but
critical look at it.</p>

<p>Finally, a central issue for all of us is how consciousness
changes in such a way that the mass of people who have gone along
with the system can turn against it. Pete Glatter looks at one of the
most important historical experiences, the transformation of working
class ideas during the Russian Revolution of 1905, while Neil
Davidson takes up some of the same issues in a long review of the
important work on the German Revolution of 1918&#8211;1923 by the French
historian Pierre Brou&#233;, who died this summer (and whose obituary is
written by Ian Birchall).</p>
