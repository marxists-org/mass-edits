<p class="fst">Pavel V. Maksakovsky<br/>
<strong>The Capitalist Cycle</strong><br/>
<em>Brill, Historical Materialism book series, 2004, Euro 59</em></p>

<p class="fst">There was a flourishing of Marxist intellectual life in the Russia
of the mid-1920s that was wiped out with the final triumph of
Stalinism in 1928&#8211;1929. Maksakovsky, a working class revolutionary
in 1917 and a Bolshevik activist in the civil war of 1918&#8211;1921, was
part of it, trying to clarify Marxist economic understanding in
critical confrontation with non-Marxists like Kondratev (best known
for his still fashionable notion of &#8216;long waves&#8217;). This is the
only book he completed before he died of natural causes in 1928
(almost all the other participants in the debates were victims of
Stalin&#8217;s Terror).</p>

<p>Maksakovsky&#8217;s concern was with what he called the &#8216;conjuncture&#8217;,
meaning the concrete development of the capitalist boom-slump cycle.
Marx, he argued, never turned his fragmented insights into a single
account of the cycle, while bourgeois economists looked at it only in
a superficial manner.</p>

<p>Maksakovsky insists on the need to abstract from immediate
appearances so as to locate the fundamental features of the
capitalist economy in the operation of the law of value.</p>

<p>Under capitalism, the rate at which goods exchange with each other
and for money (their &#8216;exchange value&#8217;) is determined by the
amount of labour required to produce them using the average level of
techniques and skill operating in the system as a whole (&#8216;abstract
labour&#8217;). But their production involves concrete human labour
bringing physical objects (&#8216;use values&#8217;) into interaction with
each other. The correct relations between different exchange values
and different use values must exist for production to take place.</p>

<p>The more industry develops, the more complicated these relations
become. Cars cannot be produced without steel; steel without iron ore
and coal; coal without cutting machinery, winding gear and so on. But
the chains of physical interactions depend on a chain of buying and
selling, in which coal firms sell to steel firms, steel firms to car
firms and car firms to consumers &#8211; people who get wages or profits
to spend from other firms so long as they can sell their goods.</p>

<p>Such long, intertwined chains linking acts of production to final
consumption only function if two completely different conditions are
fulfilled. There have to be the correct physical relations between
things that go to produce other things, determined by the laws of
physics, chemistry and biology. But, at the same time, each act of
production has to expand the amount of value (i.e. the amount of
average abstract labour) in the hands of the owners of the particular
firm. The physical organisation of the production of use values has
somehow to correspond with the capitalist determination of prices by
exchange values.</p>

<p>That is not all. Production will not take place at all unless
capitalists think they can sustain themselves in competition with
other capitalists by getting a rate of profit at least equal to the
average in the system as a whole. To guarantee this they have
repeatedly to reorganise production, using more advanced techniques
so as to increase productivity per worker. But as all the capitalists
try to do this, they continually reduce the average amount of labour
needed to produce goods &#8211; and therefore the value of the goods. The
physical quantity of goods produced by the system will tend to rise,
but the value of each individual goods to fall. The two things
necessary for the system to function, the physical organisation of
production and the flows of value through the system, both change
repeatedly &#8211; but without there being any automatic compatibility
between the changes taking place.</p>

<p>Firms undertake production by buying physical equipment (machines,
buildings, computers and so on) at prices dependent on the average
amount of labour needed to produce them at a particular moment in
time. But even as production is taking place, increases in
productivity elsewhere in the system are reducing the value of that
equipment and of the goods the firm is producing with it. The firm&#8217;s
profitability calculations were based on the amount it had to spend
on this equipment in the past, not on what its present value is
(attempts to refute Marx&#8217;s arguments by people like Okishio and
Steedman do not grasp this simple point): it is its initial
investment that the firm has to make a profit on.</p>

<p>Not only do the values of goods keep changing, but, Maksakovsky
shows, the reaction of capitalists to these changes leads to
calculation in terms of prices to diverge from those in terms of
values. As profits fall, some firms stop new investments for a
period. This reduces the demand for other firms that supplied them
previously; they try to maintain their sales by cutting their prices
below the levels as determined by value considerations, and to
protect their profits by sacking workers and cancelling their own
investments. A wave of contraction goes through the economy, and with
it a general reduction of prices below values.</p>

<p>The contraction does not last forever. Some firms go bankrupt,
allowing other firms to buy new plant and equipment on the cheap and
to cut the wages which workers are prepared to accept. Eventually, a
point is reached where they can expect to get higher than average
profits if they embark on a new round of investment; other firms to
sell them goods they have stockpiled; a new wave of expansion to take
off as capitalists rush to take advantage of the better business
conditions. Competition leads firms to undertake levels of investment
which, temporarily, exceed the existing output of new machinery,
components and raw materials. The &#8216;overproduction&#8217; of the
downturn is replaced by &#8216;underproduction&#8217; in the upturn, and just
as prices before were below values, now they are above values.</p>
<p>But this only lasts until all the new plant and machinery passes
into operation, increasing output at the same time as cutting values,
making some investment unprofitable and giving rise in time to yet
another downturn.</p>

<p>Maksakovsky&#8217;s central point is that the cycle is not a result of
mistaken decisions by individual capitalists or their governments,
but of the very way value expresses itself in prices. This takes
place through a continual oscillation, with prices rising above and
falling below values, not through some continuous equilibrium.</p>

<p>This cannot be grasped without starting with the objective
contradictions expressed in the notion of value. Only by
dialectically drawing out these contradictions was Marx able to
provide an overview of the system&#8217;s dynamic.</p>

<p>There is only one fault in Maksakovsky&#8217;s reasoning on these
matters. He sees overproduction in relation to demand as
precipitating the crisis, rather than overaccumulation of capital in
relation to the surplus value, as Marx does in Volume Three of <strong>Capital</strong>.
Overaccumulation expresses itself on the one side as a fall in the
rate of profit; on the other side as the production of more goods
than consumers can afford to buy. Hence the difficulties of getting
out of the crisis in the short term. Attempts to raise the rate of
profit by the classic means of wage-cutting reduce consumer demand
still more and deepen the crisis; attempts to increase demand
(through Keynesian-type measures) cut into profits and also deepen
the crisis. Not until some firms have gone broke, leaving room for
other firms to resume profitable expansion, can such measures be effective.</p>

<p>Maksakovsky recognises that the capitalist state or bankers can
prolong the phase of expansion through controls on credit although,
he insists, only to make the eventual eruption of crisis more
profound. He argues against economists who believed that state
capitalism was doing away with crises in the 1920s by pointing to the
international character of the system: &#8216;State capitalism, on the
scale of capitalist production in its totality and transcending
&#8220;national limitations&#8221;, is historically impossible.&#8217; He could
not, of course, foresee conditions in the aftermath of the crisis of
the 1930s when a collapse of international trade and historically
massively high levels of arms expenditure enabled states to intervene
to prevent overaccumulation (and &#8216;underproduction&#8217;) precipitating
a slide into slump. Not until the mid-1970s in the West and the late
1980s in the USSR did they find themselves unable to intervene.</p>

<p>There are some gems in Maksakovsky&#8217;s analysis. His devastating
onslaught on Kondratev&#8217;s long waves theory is still relevant today
when many economists, influenced by Ernest Mandel, somehow see this
theory as part of Marxist common sense.</p>

<p>The work limits itself to the cycle and so does not look at the
long term trends in the system: the impact of increased investment
per worker (the &#8216;rising organic composition of capital&#8217;) on
profit rates, and the impact of the concentration and centralisation
of capital on the crisis &#8211; questions which are important for anyone
trying to understand present-day capitalism. It is, however, very
useful within this limitation-and a reminder of how alive Soviet
Marxism was before Stalin strangled it.</p>
