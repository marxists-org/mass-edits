<p class="fst">The May issue of <strong>Monthly Review</strong> is the best for a long time. It contains an
outstanding article on Albert Einstein&#8217;s Marxist politics (by John
J. Simon and available at <a href="http://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/" target="new">http://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/</a>); a very useful piece commemorating the 20th anniversary of Levins&#8217; and Lewontin&#8217;s pathbreaking <strong>The Dialectical Biologist</strong> (by Brett Clark and Richard
York); an account of the international experience in organising
informal sector workers (by Fatma Ulku Selcuk); and an account of how
the US AFL-CIO union federation&#8217;s international department has
continued its long history of working for an agenda laid down by the
CIA and the State Department &#8211; which has had its effect on TUC
policy as regards Latin America.</p>

<p>In the previous issue Michael D. Yates provides a thoroughgoing <em>Statistical Portrait of the US Working Class</em> (available at <a href="http://monthlyreview.org/2005/04/01/a-statistical-portrait-of-the-u-s-working-class/" target="new">http://monthlyreview.org/2005/04/01/a-statistical-portrait-of-the-u-s-working-class/</a>)</p>
<p>Hidden away in the back end of the March&#8211;April <strong>New
Left Review</strong> (number 32) is an article which
complements very well Simon Gilbert&#8217;s piece on China&#8217;s workers in
this journal. Yan Lian reviews a survey of peasant life by Chen Guidi
and Wu Chuntao that has been banned by the Chinese government. It
provides a devastating account of the desperate plight and sporadic
rebellions of half the population as neo-liberals exalt the country&#8217;s
embrace of the market as the model for the whole third world.</p>

<p>Also of interest in this issue of <strong>NLR</strong>
are the first part of a long piece by Giovanni Arrighi arguing that
the US is losing its global hegemony, a piece by Wang Chaohua on
Taiwan and a review by John Newsinger of two recent books telling of
the barbarity of the British crushing of the Mao Mao movement in
Kenya half a century ago.</p>

<p>John Newsinger also appears in a debate with Andy Croft over
George Orwell in issue 26 of <strong>Socialist History</strong>.</p>

<p>A useful follow-on for readers of Claudio Katz&#8217;s article in this
issue will be the April <strong>Science and Society</strong>. It contains a symposium on left strategy
in Latin America, with pieces by the former Mexican foreign minister
Jorge Casta&#241;eda, the left wing academic specialist on Venezuela,
Steve Ellner, the Cuba-based Chilian activist and journalist Marta
Harnecker and veteran left wing commentator James Petras.</p>

<p>Recent issues of the <strong>Journal of Agrarian Change</strong> have carried a three part
book-length study of the rise of capitalist agriculture in Scotland
by Neil Davidson (whose review of Pierre Brou&#233;&#8217;s <strong>The
German Revolution</strong> will appear in our next journal).
It is very relevant to the debate over the rise of capitalism with
Bob Brenner which took place at the day school we organised with
<strong>Historical Materialism</strong> last year. The issues also contain what look like interesting
articles on the effect of the neo-liberal turn in Vietnam, Jamaica
and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Anyone interested in controversies in Marxist economics should
look at Rick Kuhn&#8217;s long piece (using previously unpublished and
untranslated material) on the German Marxist of the 1920s Henryk
Grossman in <strong>Research in Political Economy 21</strong>.</p>

<p>The <em>Marxists Internet Archive</em> have recently announced that
they have created and massively expanded their online Marxist writers
archive in Arabic, including a lot by Lenin and Trotsky (they say,
much of it for the first time). <a href="../../../../arabic/index.htm" target="new">www.marxists.org/arabic/index.htm</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the issue of <strong>Revolutionary History</strong> that comes out around the same time as this
journal looks to be a real treat. It is devoted to the Russian
Revolution of 1905, with translations of eyewitness reports and
workers&#8217; leaflets, accounts of the mass strikes and preparations
for uprisings, unpublished pieces by Rosa Luxemburg and much more.</p>
