<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="fst">The Tories are back. Five years after the ignominious defeat of
Tory Prime Minister Edward Heath at the hands of the miners, we again
have a right-wing Tory government. It has a substantial majority in
parliament and can pass into law virtually any measure it wants.</p>

<p>The measures the Tories are already promising include legal action
to make picketing and rank and file trade union organisation more
difficult, new laws to harass immigrants, increased spending on the
army and police, destruction of jobs in the civil service and local
government, and an increase in taxes on spending (which we all pay)
linked with a cut in the upper levels of income tax (which affect
chiefly the rich).</p>

<p>Many people who voted Labour are asking: &#8216;What went wrong?&#8217;
Was it the strikes? Was it the Labour Party? Was it us? Would things
have been different if it had been a <i>left-wing</i> Labour government?</p>

<p>Within ten days of the General Election, former education minister
Shirley Williams, whose 9,000 Labour majority in Stevenage was
transformed into a majority for the Tories of 1,296, was giving out
her own explanation for Labour&#8217;s failure in <b>The Observer</b>.</p>

<p>The blame lay, she said, with the strikes at the beginning of
1979: &#8216;Rubbish in the streets, disrupted hospitals, closed schools,
in some places the dead unburied ... Industrial action damaged the
whole community.&#8217; On top of this, she argued, there was the
presence within the Labour Party of elements who allowed the Tory cry
of &#8216;Reds under the bed&#8217; to stick: &#8216;The stew at Newham, the wild
&#8220;troops out&#8221; demonstrators, the bullying and intimidating tone of
some trade union leaders during the strikes ...&#8217;</p>

<p>Of course the strikes did weaken the government&#8217;s claim to have
the unions in its pocket. But they didn&#8217;t put people off joining
trade unions &#8211; the number of trade unionists has grown by more than
a million in the past five years. So Labour cannot blame its defeat
on the unions.</p>

<p>No, the election result was a vote of &#8216;no confidence&#8217; by
former Labour supporters in the performance of Labour in government &#8211;
in &#8216;Labour&#8217;s Britain&#8217;.</p>

<p>Shirley Williams half gives the game away when she admits: &#8216;We
were the party of the <i>status quo</i>. We had been in government
for 10 of the past 14 years.&#8217;</p>

<p>What <i>was</i> Labour&#8217;s Britain?</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<a name="pt1"></a>
<h3>Section 1.</h3>

<a name="pt1-1"></a>
<h4>Labour&#8217;s Britain</h4>

<p class="fst">The fact is that the five years of Labour government saw a
deterioration in virtually every aspect of the lives of working people:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>HOUSING:</b> By 1978 fewer council houses were being
built than in any year since the end of the Second World War.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>HEALTH:</b> The first two years of Labour government saw
the loss of 25,000 hospital beds.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>EDUCATION:</b> Shirley Williams herself was responsible
for making cuts in schools and colleges that put large numbers of
teachers on the dole for the first time in living memory.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>PRICES:</b> doubled between 1974 and 1979. Electricity,
gas, postal charges and bus and rail fares led the way as the
government withdrew subsidies to nationalised industries. Food
prices soared as food subsidies were taken away.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>JOBS:</b> During the first three years jobs disappeared
at the rate of <i>a thousand a day</i>. Since then the increase in
unemployment has been disguised by schemes such as Job Creation &#8211;
which created mostly short-term jobs anyway. Factory closures were
still being announced in the weeks before the election.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>WAGES:</b> Robert Sheldon, then financial secretary to
the Treasury, told the House of Commons on 30 January 1979 that a
family of four on average earnings were &#163;2.65 worse off <i>in real
terms</i> than in 1974, and their living standards were lower than
in 1972. The incomes of more than 200,000 workers with children are
<i>below</i> the social security poverty line.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>INEQUALITY</b> between the rich and the rest remained as
great as ever. As Professor Peter Townsend has noted: &#8216;Eleven
years of Labour government in the last 15 has not resulted in
greater equality.&#8217; Indeed, in the first two years under Labour,
the share of the nation&#8217;s wealth held by the richest 5 per cent of
the population <i>rose</i> from 43.1 per cent to 46.2 &#8211; while that
the bottom 50 per cent <i>fell</i> from 7.1 per cent to 5.6.</li>
</ul>

<p class="fst">No wonder the figures show that an increased number of the rich
voted Labour, while growing numbers of workers moved away!</p>

<p>These are not just figures on paper, they are the very framework
of people&#8217;s lives &#8211; lives that have become increasingly cramped
and restricted.</p>

<p>Former Labour ministers and TV pundits complain about the rubbish
in the streets during the election, but they generally ignored things
of greater importance to the people living in those streets &#8211; the
destruction of people&#8217;s lives by unemployment, the chronically sick
sent home as hospital wards are closed, the months of pain while
waiting for an operation, the nursery schools that never opened and
the old people&#8217;s homes that shut down, the worker on &#163;40 a week
who finds his rates have doubled, the car-worker who can no longer
afford a third-hand mini, the tenant who has abandoned hope of the
council doing repairs.</p>

<p>The <b>1974 Labour Party Manifesto</b> correctly told how, &#8216;for
the vast majority of families, the economic crisis takes the form of
fear for their jobs, ever-rising prices, particularly food prices,
and ever-rising housing costs, particularly council rents and
mortgage rates, coupled with the most drastic cuts in their income
which people have experienced since the 1930s.&#8217;</p>

<p>But five years of Labour government have not improved our lives in
<i>any</i> of these matters. So is it surprising that many former
Labour supporters were no longer prepared to support a government
committed to the <i>status quo</i> &#8211; committed to keeping things as
they were? Is it surprising that, in the south and Midlands at least,
many even preferred the spurious Tory promise of change?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The about-turn</h4>

<p class="quoteb"><i>&#8216;We will squeeze the rich until the pips squeak.&#8217;</i><br/>
Denis Healey, 1974.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>&#8216;It is our intention to bring about a fundamental
and irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour
of working people and their families.&#8217;</i><br/>
Labour election manifesto, 1974.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>&#8216;The crisis that we inherit when we come to power
will be the occasion for fundamental change and not the occasion for
postponing it.&#8217;</i><br/>
Anthony Wedgwood Benn, February 1974.</p>

<p class="fst">If the pronouncements of its ministers were to be believed, the
Labour government which took over in March 1974 was going to embark
on a series of reforms aimed at making Britain a fairer and better society.</p>

<p>Its policies were not <i>socialist</i> &#8211; in the sense that they
didn&#8217;t aim to destroy capitalism. But it was argued that it was
possible to do away with the worst excesses of the system by
government action. The Labour manifesto argued: &#8216;The British
people, both as workers and consumers, must have more control over
the powerful private forces that at present dominate our economic life.&#8217;</p>

<p>This was to be achieved by a series of measures:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;We shall create a powerful National Enterprise Board
... Land required for development will be taken into public ownership
... There will be majority public participation in North Sea oil
ownership and distribution ...&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">And, through &#8216;a new Industry Act and through a Planning
Agreement system&#8217;, the government would &#8216;plan with industry more effectively&#8217;.</p>

<p>At the same time Labour promised to &#8216;tackle rising prices&#8217; and
&#8216;strike at the roots of the worst poverty&#8217; through the extension
of &#8216;food subsidies, to be applied to those items bearing most
heavily on the family budget&#8217;, through moves &#8216;to revise and
expand the National Health Service&#8217; and to abolish prescription
charges, through moves to &#8216;expand the Education Service&#8217;, through
&#8216;special attention to the manpower needs of all public services
approaching breakdown&#8217;, and finally through moves to &#8216;create the
right climate for incomes to grow in line with production&#8217; and on
the basis of voluntary co-operation between unions and government.
Compulsory wage controls were ruled out.</p>

<p>Few, if any, of these promises had been fulfilled by May 1979.</p>

<p>The shift in wealth was, as we have already seen, <i>from</i> the
poor <i>to</i> the rich.</p>

<p>The National Enterprise Board certainly didn&#8217;t control private
industry &#8211; at best it stopped a few firms collapsing in return for
the acceptance of large scale redundancies by the workers, while
paying out large sums to former shareholders. It was part of what its
architect, Tony Wedgwood Benn, now calls &#8216;the life support system
of capitalism.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Planning Agreement system never got off the ground.</p>

<p>The great oil monopolies continue to dominate the production and
distribution of North Sea oil.</p>

<p>Food subsidies were <i>abolished</i>, and the nationalised
industries were forced to <i>raise</i> their prices.</p>

<p>Spending on health and education was slashed, not expanded.
Prescription charges remain untouched.</p>

<p>Government &#8216;attention to the manpower needs of all public
services&#8217; meant cutting the workforces, not increasing them.</p>

<p>The only &#8216;public service&#8217; to be expanded was military
spending. As Harold Wilson&#8217;s press secretary, Joe Haines, wrote
later: &#8216;Even after the defence cuts of 1976, the Labour government
was promising to spend more on defence than the Heath government
would have done ...&#8217;</p>

<p>Far from incomes growing, they were cut by a <i>compulsory</i> pay
policy. And far from the government controlling &#8216;the powerful
private forces that at present dominate our economic life&#8217;, by the
beginning of 1979 the situation had been reached where one
pro-government commentator, Peter Jenkins of <b>The Guardian</b>,
could write:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;One aspect of the situation worthy of note is the
extent to which what used to be called the &#8216;management of the
economy&#8217; has passed to the City of London. It is the market that
makes policies ...&#8217; (<b>Guardian</b>, 8 February 1979).</p>

<p class="fst">How is this complete abandonment of Labour&#8217;s manifesto promises
to be explained?</p>

<p>The simplest explanation is that they were betrayed by Labour&#8217;s
<i>right-wing</i> leaders. Betrayal there certainly was, but it would
hardly have been different under &#8216;left-wing&#8217; leaders. Closely
associated with the Labour government&#8217;s policies were the
&#8216;left-wing&#8217; leaders of the two biggest unions &#8211; Hugh Scanlon
and Jack Jones &#8211; and for the final three years Michael Foot was
actually deputy prime minister, while many other left-wingers happily
went along with Labour&#8217;s policies as ministers.</p>

<p>So why was it that right and left alike within the Parliamentary
Labour Party forgot their promises? Their own explanation is that
they were &#8216;blown off course&#8217;.</p>

<p>Thus, back in July 1975, Tony Wedgwood Benn told a conference of
the Institute for Workers&#8217; Control that the government had changed
course because &#8216;the problems it inherited had been much greater
than foreseen&#8217;.</p>

<p>What blew them off course?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<a name="pt1-3"></a>
<h4>&#8216;The Commanding Heights&#8217;</h4>

<p class="fst">It is usual to talk of a new government &#8216;taking power&#8217; after
an election. It is more accurate to say that it &#8216;takes office&#8217;.
For most of the power in our society in fact lies elsewhere.</p>

<p>This applies above all to <i>economic</i> power &#8211; the power to
decide what goods will be produced, who will work to produce these
goods, what they will be paid, what the prices of those goods will
be. Such decisions are not taken by the elected government, but by
those who own and control industry. And in Britain today, ownership
and control lies in the hands of a small and privileged class of people.</p>

<p><i>One per cent</i> of the population of Britain own <i>84 per
cent</i> of the country&#8217;s industrial wealth, through their
ownership of stocks and shares. 97 per cent of us own no shares at all.</p>

<p>Half the goods produced are turned out by the 100 largest
companies. Control over their operation lies in the hands of a small
board of directors in each case. Since it is usual for each director
to sit on the boards of at least three or four companies, that puts
half the production of the country in the hands of a very small
number of people, say 600 altogether.</p>

<p>These men have immense power.</p>

<p>If, for instance, they decide a factory is making insufficient
profit, they can close it without a thought, even though it means
unemployment and hardship for thousands of workers.</p>

<p>If they decide they can make an easy profit by investing in
property or commodity speculation, they can do so at will, even
though it will force up prices for the rest of us.</p>

<p>If they decide they can make a quick buck by moving their money
abroad, they can do so overnight, regardless of the chaos caused to
the country&#8217;s economy.</p>

<p>When Labour leaders say they were &#8216;blown off course&#8217;, it is
this economic power that raised the wind.</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that those 600 company directors met to plan a
campaign of chaos (although they do meet at company dinners and
business conferences and do on occasion plan campaigns of chaos). But
they act together without this, because each plans what his company
does according to how much profit he reckons can be made. If he does
not have &#8216;confidence&#8217; in the government&#8217;s willingness or
ability to provide <i>profitable</i> conditions, then he decides not
to invest in new production or to move company money abroad, and
economic chaos results.</p>

<p>One leading industrialist, Sir Frederick Catherwood, declared
early in the Labour government&#8217;s term of office that &#8216;an
investment strike&#8217; was taking place. In May 1975 Lord Watkinson,
former Tory minister, head of Cadbury-Schweppes and vice-president of
the employers&#8217; organisation, the CBI, boasted of the &#8216;industrial
muscle&#8217; of big business and talked of its ability to engage in
confrontation with the government.</p>

<p>That an investment strike did take place is shown by the following
figures for extra capital investment in manufacturing industry. In
1974 this had already fallen to 76 percent of the 1970 figure, but in
1975 it fell to 45.6 per cent, and in 1976 to 35.1 per cent &#8211; half
what it was when Labour took office.</p>

<p>At the end of February 1975 the <b>International Herald Tribune</b>
reported that after the big oil companies had &#8216;threatened an
investment strike which would hold back development&#8217; of North Sea
oil, the government had amended its Petroleum Revenue Tax to give the
companies an extra &#163;1000 million over the next five years.</p>

<p>The investment strike is not the sort of strike that gets Page One
treatment in <b>The Sun</b> and the <b>Daily Mirror</b>. It is not
denounced by ministers. The strike leaders are not witch-hunted from
one TV channel to the next. But its impact is far more damaging,
especially during an international economic crisis, destroying the
livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people as factories are
closed, others go on short-time, projected new factories fail to
open. This investment strike was the main reason why in 1977&#8211;78
less wealth was being created in Britain than during the three-day
week of January 1974.</p>

<p>The effect of this investment strike in forcing the government to
abandon its promises can easily be seen.</p>

<p>Soon after the formation of the Labour government in March 1974,
Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey boasted that his aim was &#8216;to
use the tax system to promote greater social and economic equality&#8217;.
The rich were to bear a greater share of the tax burden than they
have under the last government&#8217;, he told the House of Commons on 26
March 1974.</p>

<p>To do this he raised taxes on high income earners and on company profits.</p>

<p>In the weeks that followed the directors of the major companies
began to raise a tremendous hullaballoo, claiming they &#8216;couldn&#8217;t
afford to invest&#8217;. The investment strike began, and by November
1974 Healey had already changed his tune. In a special budget he
relaxed the tax rules for companies, giving them back &#163;800 million
profit a year, &#8216;so as to avert the real and immediate danger of a
cut in investment, stock-building and employment&#8217;.</p>

<p>The investment strike went on.</p>

<p>In Spring 1975 the dustcart drivers of Glasgow demanded modest
improvements in their wages. The government sent troops in to break
their strike. But no troops were used against the investment strike
that was by now pushing unemployment higher and higher. Instead in
1975 and 1976 further concessions were made in the company tax rules,
until experts suggested that no sensible company need pay any
Corporation Tax at all.</p>

<p>Taxation of companies had raised 7.4 per cent of total taxation in
1974&#8211;75. By the year 1975&#8211;76 it was &#8216;negligible&#8217;, according
to the <b>Financial Times</b> (31 March 1977). The Treasury admitted
that after Healey&#8217;s new allowances &#8216;the residual mainstream
Corporation Tax bill can be nil&#8217; (<b>Economic Progress Report</b>,
February 1977). The government&#8217;s Public Expenditure White Paper in
early 1979 estimated that these allowances had given companies an
extra &#163;6,100 million in profits per year.</p>

<p>There was more for the individual rich too. Higher tax rates were
cut in April 1976 and again in 1977. The CBI were overjoyed. &#8216;The
overall shape of the budget was bang in line with what we campaigned
for,&#8217; they declared.</p>

<p>Taxation was in fact being used to squeeze the poor in the
interests of the rich.</p>

<p>The investment strike brought a similarly rapid transformation of
the government&#8217;s price controls.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Price controls were progressively relaxed between
December 1974 and June 1976 ... These relaxations, in association
with tight wage controls, were accompanied by an increasing share of
the national income going to profit.&#8217; (R. Tarling and F. Wilkinson,
<b>Cambridge Journal of Economics</b>, 1977, no.&nbsp;4).</p>

<p>James Callaghan explained the reason behind all these moves when
he spoke at the Labour Party Conference in September 1976: &#8216;Industry
must have the confidence needed to invest. And that requires that
they must be able to earn a surplus, which is a euphemism for saying
they must be able to make a profit.&#8217;</p>

<p>Foreshadowing one of Thatcher&#8217;s slogans, he declared that
&#8216;Wealth must be created before it can be distributed&#8217;.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<a name="pt1-4"></a>
<h4>Industrialists rampage</h4>

<p class="fst">The investment strike was only one way big business dealt with a
government that was at first reluctant to dance to their every whim.
Another was the rapid movement of money abroad, clearly shown in the
summers of 1975 and 1976.</p>

<p>Throughout April 1975 the value of the pound had been steady. Then
in May it began to plunge, as vast sums in sterling were sold in
exchange for foreign currencies. Who was responsible and why?</p>

<p>Popular mythology was prone to blame &#8216;the gnomes of Zurich&#8217;,
foreign speculators. <b>The Financial Times</b> told a different
story. Sterling was being sold, it said in mid-June, not by foreign
speculators but by &#8216;big corporations, including UK corporations.&#8217;</p>
<p>The reason was described by the <b>Sunday Times</b>. They were out
to make the government abandon its repeated promises not to introduce
statutory wage controls:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;The sterling crisis is the logical climax to the mood
of hysteria, necessary to produce an agreed incomes policy ... As one
perspicacious follower of the exchange markets put it: &#8220;It looks as
if they are putting the frighteners on&#8221;.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">They were remarkably successful. On the morning of 30 June Prime
Minister Harold Wilson made a speech at Stoneleigh in which he
insisted: &#8216;We reject panic solutions&#8217;. While he was speaking,
sterling was being sold as never before and the pound dropped 5 cents
against the dollar. Wilson rushed back to London in a panic to an
emergency meeting with the Governor of the Bank of England.
Government policy was reversed. Within 24 hours a compulsory &#163;6
limit had been imposed on wage rises.</p>

<p>The same wholesale selling of sterling was repeated again and
again in 1976.</p>

<p>That April and May there was some argument between government and
union leaders over the exact terms of the next year of wage controls.
Every time there was a sign of hesitancy on the part of the trade
union movement about accepting further cuts in workers&#8217; living
standards, those with wealth &#8216;lost confidence&#8217; in the government
and the pound sagged.</p>

<p>When the Scottish TUC rejected a proposed 3 per cent limit,
massive selling of sterling followed immediately. When South Wales
miners&#8217; leader Emlyn Williams spoke against wage controls, the
value of the pound fell by a full cent in less than an hour. When it
seemed briefly that the National Union of Mineworkers would reject
wage controls, the pound plunged downwards again.</p>

<p>So open were the machinations of big business against sterling
that even Jack Jones, then general secretary of the Transport and
General Workers&#8217; Union, denounced &#8216;financial manipulation&#8217; &#8211;
but it didn&#8217;t prevent him declaring that &#8216;the time is not ripe&#8217;
for bringing forward increases in pensions to help old people cope
with raging inflation.</p>

<p>The investment strike and the repeated runs on the pound also
brought the reversal of Labour&#8217;s election commitment to improve
health, education, housing and all the other social services. Cuts
were imposed in 1976 on a scale the Tories had never dared contemplate.</p>

<p>Nationalised industry subsidies were cut, forcing prices up for
electricity, gas, rail and bus fares. Education was cut by &#163;618
million, the Health Service by &#163;300 million, housing subsidies by
&#163;300 million, food subsidies phased out altogether.</p>

<p>The <b>Financial Times</b> commented on &#8216;the final demise of
post-war social democratic orthodoxy&#8217;. He wrote: &#8216;The triple
pillars that have supported the Labour Party of Attlee, Gaitskell and
Wilson &#8211; the welfare state, full employment and the mixed economy &#8211;
have crumbled.&#8217;</p>

<p>Yet that was only the start. Another &#163;2,000 million in cuts followed.</p>

<p>It was still not enough to appease those who held financial power.
By December 1976 the price they exacted for laying off their attacks
on the pound was a government agreement with the International
Monetary Fund for another &#163;1,000 million in cuts, bringing the total
for the year to &#163;6,000 million.</p>
<p>Joe Haines has told how each set of cuts would be agreed: &#8216;The
Prime Minister would have been greeted by the Governor of the Bank of
England with the news that huge holders of sterling were about to
withdraw their deposits and that the only way to regain confidence
would be further drastic cuts in public expenditure. That has
happened in 1975 and 1976.&#8217;</p>

<p>The <b>New Statesman</b> has shown what that did to the
government&#8217;s election promises:</p>

<h4>Connivers in high places</h4>

<p class="fst">But, you may ask, why didn&#8217;t Labour ministers use their clear
majority in parliament (which was there until 1977, when they became
dependent on Liberal support) to stop such sabotage by big business?
Wasn&#8217;t it because right-wing Labour ministers were so closely tied
to business interests themselves &#8211; Jim Callaghan himself is a
former bank director &#8211; to turn against them? Wouldn&#8217;t things have
been different if there had been better people at the top of the
Labour Party?</p>

<p>No. Left-wing, <b>Tribune</b> group members such as Michael Foot
and Stanley Orme went along with these policies with hardly a
complaint. The reason was they felt powerless against the investment
strike and the selling of sterling. They saw the economy plunging
into chaos and could find no instruments to bring it under control.</p>

<p>For not only the &#8216;commanding heights&#8217; of the economy, but much
of the machinery of government too was operating beyond the
government&#8217;s control.</p>

<p>A government can get its decisions implemented only by relying on
the people who run the state machine &#8211; the heads of the civil
service, the Governor of the Bank of England, the directors of the
nationalised industries, the men who control the BBC and the
Independent Broadcasting Authority, the judges, the senior officers
of the police and armed forces. But these people, almost to a man,
come from the same small class of people who own and control
industry. Four-fifths of senior army officers, civil servants and
high court judges went to public schools and Oxbridge universities.
Indeed, they are interchangeable: retired civil servants and army
officers become directors of companies, and such directors receive
government posts and directorships of nationalised industries.</p>

<p>The men on whom the government depends move in the same circles as
the rich &#8211; indeed their salaries ensure that they are rich
themselves &#8211; and they accept the same ideas about society. They
impose these ideas on the government. Joe Haines tells how &#8216;from
1974, Defence fought to spend more against Labour&#8217;s commitment to
spend less; Environment waged war against the railway system when the
Labour Party was pro-railway; and the Treasury persuaded the
government in February 1976 to retreat from its commitment to a
Wealth Tax.&#8217;</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the people who control the state machine &#8216;lose
confidence&#8217; in government policies that seem likely to damage the
drive for profit and the wealth of their social circle. So they feel
it is their duty to obstruct such policies.</p>

<p>This was shown blatantly at least three times in 1974&#8211;79.</p>

<p>When the run on the pound was organised by top financial and
industrial circles in summer 1975 to &#8216;put the frighteners&#8217; on the
union leaders, the heads of the Treasury and the Bank, far from
taking immediate counter-action, encouraged this move. The <b>Financial
Times</b> reported at the time: &#8216;There are those in Whitehall who
argue that alarm about the pound is a necessary ingredient in
negotiating new wage guidelines.&#8217;</p>

<p>The <b>Sunday Times</b> made the same point:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Instead of the Treasury and the Bank of England
arguing violently the virtues of the pound, the authorities seem
anxious that no one should miss the gravity of the situation and the
need for action.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Peter Jenkins of <b>The Guardian</b> reported on 28 October 1976
what a &#8216;wholly authoritative foreign source&#8217; told him:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;One of the problems is the axis between your Treasury
and our Treasury. They seem to be agreed that the Labour manifesto is
a manual for suicide. They are constantly in touch with our people,
saying: &#8220;Don&#8217;t bail these bastards out&#8221;.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Reflecting on the experience of 1974&#8211;76, Joe Haines, by no means
a left-winger, wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;At times the determination of the Treasury to tell the
government of the day to accept policies is ruthless, even to the
point where it seeks to create conditions which make it impossible
for the Cabinet to spurn its advice.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">The same indifference to the &#8216;democratic process of elected
government&#8217; was shown by leading army officers in May 1974 when the
Loyalists of Northern Ireland staged a &#8216;strike&#8217;. Their aim was to
overthrow the Northern Ireland Executive, in which Catholic
politicians shared office with Protestants. Support for the strike
was at first lukewarm, but it was enforced by parliamentary Loyalists
with guns and clubs, who built barricades across the streets to bring
the movement of people and goods to a halt.</p>

<p>The Labour government in London wanted the army and the Northern
Ireland police to remove the barricades and bring the strike to an
end. The top army officers were unwilling. They even forced the then
prime minister, Harold Wilson, to remove from one of his speeches a
reference to &#8216;a rebellion against the Crown&#8217;.</p>

<p>A journalist on <b>The Times</b>, Robert Fisk, later described the
episode in a book:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Junior officers who came into the streets of East
Belfast to watch the Protestants patrolling the pavements conceded to
a number of journalists that Headquarters in Northern Ireland did not
want &#8220;punch-ups&#8221; with the Protestants ...&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">He concluded: &#8216;The army did play a political role in Ulster ...
The army did not trust the political judgment of the British
ministers...&#8217;</p>

<p>Finally, throughout 1974&#8211;79 the top judges both interpreted and
made the law in the interests of the rich and powerful.</p>

<p>When a conference of the local government workers&#8217; union NALGO
democratically called a one-day strike of the union&#8217;s Scottish
membership, the judges banned it. When branches of the postal
workers&#8217; union voted to black the mail for the anti-union firm
Grunwicks or the racist regime in South Africa, the judges made an
order preventing it.</p>

<p>They destroyed the power of Labour&#8217;s much-vaunted conciliation
service, ACAS, to make managements recognise unions. And one judge,
Lord Denning, even invented a new legal principle &#8211; &#8216;freedom of
the press&#8217; &#8211; to prevent journalists taking effective industrial action.</p>

<p>Government decisions that the judges do not like, they have simply
overturned. Thus the Law Lords in 1976 countermanded an order from
the Department of Education to the extreme right-wing Tory-controlled
Tameside Council to end the 11-plus.</p>

<p>It is easy to see how &#8216;impartial&#8217; were the five judges who
heard the case. Between them they held no fewer than 63,791 shares in
major companies such as British-American Tobacco, Cadbury-Schweppes,
Grand Metropolitan Hotels, ICI, RTZ, Allied Breweries, Shell,
Courtaulds. Four went to public schools and the fifth to a snob
&#8216;direct grant&#8217; school &#8211; so much for their qualification to pass
judgment on the education system they paid to avoid. Such a typical
cross-section of the British people naturally found that &#8216;justice&#8217;
was on the side of the right-wing Tories against an elected Labour government.</p>

<p>Now we can see why the honest as well as the corrupt, the left as
well as the right in the Labour government ended up placating the
rich and powerful at the expense of their own supporters. They were
faced with direct action by financial and industrial interests which
threatened to push the country over the edge into chaos.</p>

<p>They could perhaps get a Bill through parliament enabling them to
take counter-action, but it would take time, it could be delayed by
the House of Lords, and the chaos would grow. The heads of the civil
service would refuse to implement it if it threatened their own
wealthy class, and the judges would likely rule against it and in
favour of the right of those with property and wealth to do as they
liked with it, regardless of the effects for the rest of us.</p>

<p>Trying to deal with the investment strike and the run on the pound
through &#8216;constitutional&#8217;, parliamentary means is rather like
trying to bail the water out of a sinking boat with a sieve.</p>

<p>The only way the Labour government could have stopped the
wholesale sabotage of its plans would have been to take complete
control over the wealth that was being held back from investment, of
the funds that were being sold out of sterling. And since
parliamentary means of doing this could be prevented, the only way to
do it would be by urging Labour supporters in the factories and
workplaces to take control of the wealth where it is created, in the
factories and workplaces.</p>

<p>But the Labour leaders could not have done that without breaking
their most treasured principle &#8211; that change must be &#8216;gradual and
constitutional&#8217;, that the present system must be kept running while
they attempt to improve it.</p>

<p>So one after another the &#8216;left-wing&#8217; leaders of the labour
movement threw their weight behind the government. The alternative
was &#8216;the end of society as we know it&#8217;, warned Jack Jones. People
would have to be prepared to see an increase in unemployment of
200,000 to keep Labour in power, said Norman Atkinson, the
&#8216;left-wing&#8217; treasurer of the Labour Party. &#8216;We must sustain and
maintain the Labour government ... There is too much at stake if we
lose it,&#8217; insisted Tony Wedgwood Benn.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<a name="pt1-6"></a>
<h4>Swinging to the right</h4>

<p class="fst">Once the Labour Cabinet had begun trying to placate the rich by
squeezing the poor, they had to use every effort to get the poor to
accept their fate. They had to persuade the workers of the virtues of
profit, to insist again and again that &#8216;instant socialism&#8217; was no
answer, to extol inequalities as &#8216;incentives&#8217;, to blame rising
prices on those trade unionists who did try to defend their living
standards, even to give the impression that some of the unemployed
were responsible for their own fate.</p>

<p>So, at City of London banquets and union conferences, Labour
ministers campaigned for ideas that had traditionally been anathema
to their supporters. Already in January 1975 Harold Wilson was
warning that &#8216;government money will not be available for failing
sections of industry where workers have gone on strike&#8217;. From that
point on, every defence of living standards or working conditions by
those employed in companies such as British Leyland was the signal
for a government threat to withhold investment and sack workers &#8211;
until in early 1978 Leyland&#8217;s Speke plant was closed and the
workers blamed.</p>

<p>When the wages policy was imposed, those who opposed it were,
according to James Callaghan, &#8216;small bands of disrupters in industry&#8217;.</p>

<p>The TUC was only too willing to lend a hand in dealing with them.
In September 1976 the Seamen&#8217;s Union threatened strike action over
a wage award that had been agreed before the wage controls, and then
frozen. It would have raised their wages for a 40-hour week to &#163;34.
Murray of the TUC told them: &#8216;By God, we&#8217;ll make sure no union
supports you. We&#8217;ll cripple you.&#8217;</p>

<p>At the end of 1977 it was the turn of the firemen. While the
government ordered troops in to break the strike, the TUC General
Council voted not to organise solidarity.</p>

<p>When, early in Labour&#8217;s term of office, the Appeal Court refused
to free the Shrewsbury pickets who had been jailed for &#8216;conspiring&#8217;
to struggle for improved wages under the Tory government in 1972,
Labour ministers refused to pardon them because this would &#8216;interfere
with the rule of law&#8217;. The same excuse was used to avoid fulfilling
the demand of the Labour Party Conference for an end to legal
proceedings against the Clay Cross councillors who had defied Tory
orders to put up council rents.</p>

<p>Increasingly Labour ministers were preaching ideas no different to
those traditionally preached by the Tories. Labour was now pouring
scorn on the idea that there was a better way to run society than
that based on the greed for profit. Labour was telling people that
the poor were to blame for their plight: they weren&#8217;t working hard
enough. Labour was telling people the capitalist way was the only way.</p>

<p>The party&#8217;s supporters throughout the country were thrown into
confusion. They could no longer oppose right-wing ideas in the
factories and workplaces, because these ideas were being put out by
the Labour leaders every day. Inevitably the mood in the factories,
workplaces and estates moved rightwards too.</p>

<p>This applied not only to wages and jobs, but also to other ideas &#8211;
such as racism. The Tories and the National Front saw that there were
gains to be made for them by turning the discontent of working people
at their falling living standards against black people. They
campaigned for more vicious measures against immigrants &#8211; and the
Labour Home Secretaries, first Roy Jenkins then Merlyn Rees, hastened
to comply.</p>

<p>After <b>The Sun</b> and Enoch Powell had campaigned against the
entry into Britain of a few Malawi Asians, National Front Nazis
carried out three racist murders &#8211; and Jenkins told the Commons
there was &#8216;a need for limitation on immigration&#8217; and this meant
&#8216;occasional harsh decisions&#8217;.</p>

<p>As the Labour leaders preached more and more Tory ideas, it was
not surprising that a growing number of people came to think that
perhaps the Tories had been right all along. At a series of
by-elections the Tories romped home.</p>

<p>Yet Labour leaders did not change their tune. How could they? They
were dancing to someone else&#8217;s tune.</p>

<p>In August 1978 the Labour government imposed a fourth year of wage
controls. The 5 per cent limit on wage rises meant a certain fall in
workers&#8217; living standards when the Treasury was predicting an 8 per
cent increase in prices. One group of workers after another was
forced into action &#8211; at Ford, the BBC, bakery workers, provincial
journalists, tanker and lorry drivers, local authority and hospital
workers, civil servants, teachers.</p>

<p>The Tories and the entire press, including the supposedly
left-wing <b>Daily Mirror</b>, launched into abuse against the
strikers. Margaret Thatcher denounced &#8216;self-appointed strike
committees&#8217; for &#8216;usurping the powers of the elected parliament&#8217;
&#8211; a nice irony that, after the investment strike and run on the
pound by financiers and industrialists. Sir Keith Joseph screamed
that the balance of power had swung to the unions. The <b>Daily Mail</b>
covered its front page with dubious stories of alleged threats of
violence by pickets. Effective picketing was renamed &#8216;secondary
picketing&#8217; and attacked on all sides.</p>

<p>It was a hysterical onslaught by the privileged classes against
workers and trade unionists. Did the Labour Party leaders leap to the
defence of their traditional supporters? Far from it. The Labour
leaders rushed to join the attack.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Callaghan told MPs on 23 January 1979:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;I assert very clearly that everyone has the right to
work and everyone has the right to cross a picket line. It is not a
sacred object and I hope they will do so ... There is nothing to stop
a citizen crossing a picket line if he believes that is necessary,
and I would not hesitate myself to cross the line if I believed it
right to do so.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">One month later Foreign Secretary David Owen walked through a
civil servants&#8217; picket line saying: &#8216;I have great pleasure in
crossing this picket line.&#8217; Anthony Wedgwood Benn drove through the
picket line at his ministry.</p>

<p>Chancellor Denis Healey threatened crudely that if workers did not
accept the wage controls &#8211; and the cuts in living standards that
went with them &#8211; then he would deliberately create unemployment
through a &#8216;deflationary&#8217; budget.</p>

<p>Finally, when Margaret Thatcher called for laws to restrict the
right to picket, to weaken the closed shop, and to make the calling
of strikes more difficult, Callaghan rushed out an agreement with the
TUC &#8211; the Concordat &#8211; which would give everything that Thatcher
wanted without a change in the law.</p>

<p>Labour&#8217;s reaction to the strikes set the tone for the general
election campaign. Commentators noted how &#8216;low key&#8217; the
campaigning was &#8211; they rarely noted that this was because Callaghan
put up so little resistance to the basic tenets of Tory ideology. At
the end, the difference between the parties must have seemed minor to
most voters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Labour wanted to hand out more money to prop up private
industry than did the Tories.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The Tories wanted to cut income tax for the rich, raising
taxes on spending which hit the poor most &#8211; Labour would only go
half way, but promised tax cuts for the rich too.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The Tories were for selling council houses &#8211; Labour said
not too many.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The Tories were for more police &#8211; Labour boasted they had
already increased the number by 7,000.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The Tories said more should be spent on defence &#8211; Labour
said more <i>was</i> being spent on defence.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The Tories said the law should restrict picketing and the
closed shop &#8211; Labour said, the union leaders would do the
restricting.</li>
</ul>

<p class="fst">Nowhere was there any challenge to the basic Tory idea that
workers should pay the price for the economic crisis, and if they
refused, their basic rights should be attacked. Hardly surprisingly.
Labour lost the election to the party whose ideas it was preaching.</p>

<p>The election result was a disaster for Labour. The proportion of
voters voting Labour was the lowest since 1931, only 36 per cent.</p>

<p>But this is more than just the temporary annoyance of some Labour
voters. It is a downward trend that has lasted for years now:</p>

<p class="fst">In Labour&#8217;s worst year in the 1950s, 1959, they were still
receiving support from 10 per cent more of the voters than they are
now.</p>

<p>And those who turned most against Labour in 1979, at least in the
Midlands and South, were Labours traditional working-class
supporters. <b>Labour Weekly</b> wrote: &#8216;Labour did particularly
badly in (London) inner city constituencies where there is almost no
middle class at all.&#8217; The swing against Labour was 14 per cent in
Bethnal Green, 11.3 per cent in South Islington, 10.5 per cent in
Bermondsey &#8211; &#8216;by and large, the more middle-class the area, the
lower the swing.&#8217;</p>

<p>The <b>New Statesman</b> came to the conclusion, on the basis of a
MORI opinion poll, that 33 per cent of trade unionists voted Tory
against only 23 per cent in 1974.</p>

<p>The Labour Party is clearly running on the wrong lines. Can this
be put right?</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<a name="pt2"></a>
<h3>Section 2.</h3>

<a name="pt2-1"></a>
<h4>Can the Labour Party be changed?</h4>

<p class="fst">Labour has not been only a party of government. For the past 60
years it has been looked to by many rank and file socialists who have
disagreed with its leadership but who wanted to maintain contact with
the wider working-class movement.</p>

<p>These socialists now face a question: Labour in government has
moved so far to the right that is there any prospect, ever, of
turning the Labour Party into an instrument for socialist advance?</p>

<p>Wedgwood Benn and the <b>Tribune</b> Group MPs say &#8216;Yes&#8217;.</p>

<p>So too do other socialist activists in the Labour Party, though
many of them do not accept Benn&#8217;s programme. They all say that the
Labour Party is a party of the workers and must be won back from its
right-wing leaders. Then a Labour government with socialist policies
can be put into office and will open the road to socialism.</p>

<p>Is it possible?</p>

<p>The fact is that Labour was never a socialist party of the working
class. Its first parliamentary representation depended on a secret
deal with the Liberals more than 80 years ago, and all its leaders
since have been prepared to compromise with the powers-that-be &#8211;
Keir Hardy, who drew up the original deal, Arthur Henderson, who sat
in Lloyd George&#8217;s First World War Cabinet, Ramsey Macdonald, who
eventually went over to become prime minister of a Tory-run &#8216;National
Government&#8217;, Attlee who did his best to revive British capitalism
after the war, Gaitskell, who tried to remove even mention of
socialism from the party&#8217;s constitution, Harold Wilson, who tried
to push through a law against the trade unions.</p>

<p>But it is true that there was a time when the Labour Party had
deep roots in the working class, drawing into its ranks the vast
majority of workers who actively wanted to improve society. At its
height the party had more than a million paid-up members and ran a
daily paper with a circulation of more than three million.</p>

<p>Then, it was possible for the left to build a considerable
movement of workers within the party ranks. This was done in the
early 1950s by the supporters of Aneurin Bevan, the Health Minister
who resigned in 1951 in protest at the imposition of health charges.</p>

<p>But the Labour Party has changed. Since then there has been a
steady loss of activists, particularly worker activists, from the
constituency Labour Parties. This is shown by the membership figures:</p>

<table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" align="center">

</table>

<p class="fst">These figures lose all meaning in the most recent years, since a
constituency party needs at least 1,000 members to affiliate to the
national party. So with 600-odd constituency parties, there must
always be 600,000 members recorded. Even Ron Haywood, Labour&#8217;s
general secretary, has admitted the real membership is nearer
300,000. And remember, the qualification for membership is the
payment of a low subscription. The active membership is probably less
than 10 per cent.</p>

<p>So the rank and file of the Labour Party is about a third of what
it was 30 years ago. It is also less working-class.</p>

<p>Two academic studies of local Labour Parties were carried out in
the early 1960s. Both showed that the decline in membership was
accompanied by a tendency to become less working class in
composition.</p>

<p>J.E. Turner looked at three London constituencies in 1961&#8211;2. In
only one, Bermondsey, was the majority of council candidates or
General Management Committee members of manual workers. In Fulham,
with a local population three-quarters manual workers, only one in
four was a manual worker, and in South Kensington fewer than one in
ten. And that was 18 years ago.</p>

<p>Turner also showed how limited was the contact at constituency
level between the party and the trade unions. In Bermondsey trade
union delegates made up only 27 per cent of average attendance at
GMC, in Fulham only 22 per cent.</p>

<p>The weakness of the Labour Party on the ground is the biggest
problem facing socialists who try to work within it. It means that
passing a resolution at a local ward or constituency meeting achieves
little because it doesn&#8217;t bring any number of workers into activity.</p>

<p>Socialists in the Labour Party usually make a virtue of this. They
adopt the attitude that what matters is getting resolutions to annual
conference, or being well-placed at selection meetings for
councillors or MPs. What gets forgotten in the manoeuvring around
conference delegacies and selection committees is any attempt to
relate to local workers&#8217; struggles, especially unofficial strikes,
which are rarely taken up by Labour Party activists.</p>

<p>Why? Because if you&#8217;re concerned with getting support for a
resolution or winning a nomination for some election, you don&#8217;t
upset full-time union officials who may control a few votes on the GMC.</p>

<p>In Britain 95 per cent of strikes are unofficial &#8211; so that means
most left-wing Labour activists ignoring most strikes.</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean the Labour left has ignored the trade unions.
After all, they wield enormous power at Labour Party Conference with
their block votes. So the Labour left has always tried to do a deal
with a section of the trade union leadership &#8211; but this leaves the
left in the Labour Party no basis on which to build support for their
own policies in the rank and file of these unions. This is going to
be particularly important in the months ahead, since the right now
dominates Britain&#8217;s second biggest union, the Engineering Workers,
as well as the other big unions affiliated to the Labour Party &#8211;
the Electricians, the General and Municipal, the Postal Workers and
the Railwaymen.</p>

<p>So the left in the Labour Party is bound to face a choice: either
to trim its sails to maintain union support, or speak out and risk
losing it. This dilemma faced the supporters of Bevan in the early
1950s &#8211; it was not long before Bevan decided that influence at the
top of the party through the support of union leaders and &#8216;moderate&#8217;
MPs was more important than sticking with his followers.</p>

<p>Today, the Labour left argues that Tony Wedgwood Benn is different.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<a name="pt2-2"></a>
<h4>Benn: A way forward?</h4>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;The time has come,&#8217; Wedgwood Benn told the 1979 May
Day rally in Birmingham, &#8216;for the whole labour movement to face the
harsh realities, take up the challenge and reorganise its own role,
party structure and organisation.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">The Labour movement must re-assert its aim &#8216;to bring about a
fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth
to working people and their families&#8217;. It was necessary, he said,
&#8216;to defend the interests of working people and their families
against any policies which would threaten world peace, restrict our
democratic rights, reduce our living standards or undermine our civil
liberties.&#8217;</p>

<p>A few days later Benn refused to stand for the Labour Shadow
Cabinet and took his place on the back benches for the first time in
22 years.</p>

<p>In the pages of <b>Tribune</b> he was more forthright:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Labour&#8217;s best hope for winning mass support lies in
a vigorous defence of those who work &#8220;by hand and by brain&#8221; and
in uncompromising advocacy of the radical reforms necessary to get
back full employment, to expand social services and to move towards self-management.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">That Benn is certainly going to speak out on issues affecting
workers&#8217; conditions in a way entirely different to that of the
other Labour ex- ministers was shown in an article he wrote for the
<b>Times Challenger</b>, the paper produced by workers locked out by
<b>Times</b> newspapers, in May 1979:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;What we need is a fight to the finish between a
foreign multinational determined to defend its wealth and power and
British workers who are defending their profession and press freedom.
It is a struggle in which none of us dare be neutral.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">The same tone was there when he addressed the TASS union conference:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Trade union strength and aims are modest compared with
the influence wielded by the City and large corporations ... The
Labour Party has bailed out capitalism three times since 1945, and it
seems that only the Labour Party can run capitalism. That was not
what we were invented to do. We must have the vision and courage, and
we certainly have the experience, to push the frontiers forward.&#8217;
(Reported in the <b>Guardian</b>, 23 May 1979).</p>

<p class="fst">The press has treated Benn&#8217;s moves as a bid for the leadership.
It is certainly not that in the sense of a short-term move to replace
Callaghan. Benn realises he has no chance of doing that while the
majority of Labour MPs, who choose the leader of the party, is well
to the right.</p>

<p>No, Benn&#8217;s aim seems to be to start a new current in the wider
labour movement that will later be able to put pressure on the
parliamentary party.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s look more closely at what Benn offers as an alternative.</p>

<p>In his speeches Benn makes great play of the need for &#8216;socialist
policies&#8217;, but his own specific policies have little to do with
socialism &#8211; if by that we mean replacing the capitalist system. In
fact he himself admits he wants &#8216;radical reform&#8217;. When he stood
against Callaghan for the leadership of the party three years ago,
his platform was made up of three planks: import controls, planning
agreements, and increased power for MPs.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><b>IMPORT CONTROLS</b> are not socialist. They mean leaving
industry in private hands, then using state intervention to get
orders for the owners of British industry instead of their foreign
rivals. In the first 30 years of this century they were the rallying
cry of the Tory Party.</p>

<p>One immediate effect of import controls would be to raise prices.
Assume, for instance, a ban on shoe imports from Poland and
Czechoslovakia. The British shoe factories, mostly owned by Charles
Clore, would face less competition. They would raise their prices.
Workers would have to pay more for their shoes. And, of course,
Clore&#8217;s profits would climb.</p>

<p>Any increase in jobs in the shoe industry would be at the expense
of everyone else&#8217;s living standards.</p>

<p>But import controls are exceptionally short-sighted. For if we
import shoes from Poland, we also export heavy machinery to Poland &#8211;
and if we restricted the sale of Polish shoes in Britain, Poland
would retaliate by cutting its imports from Britain. So the price of
more jobs in shoe factories would be the loss of jobs in engineering
factories. The crisis would get worse.</p>

<p>In fact this is what happened in the 1930s. Every country imposed
import controls, and in every country unemployment grew. The only
thing that brought the vicious circle to an end was something even
more vicious &#8211; the attempt by each country to keep others out of
its own markets around the world found its logical conclusion in war.</p>

<p>Because socialists have understood this in the past, we have
always opposed import controls. They are just one more way of
tampering with the system to try to make it work.</p>

<p>Worse, the call for import controls divides the working class
movement in one country from that in another. They are a futile
attempt to export unemployment and so are resented by workers abroad
&#8211; making international unity of workers against the multinational
companies that now dominate the world economy yet more difficult.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><b>PLANNING AGREEMENTS</b> are no more socialist than import
controls. They involve union representatives acting in collaboration
with management and government to ensure that their firm is &#8216;viable&#8217;,
in other words profitable.</p>

<p>In a recent speech in the Commons, Benn said that &#8216;democracy
should be developed so that those who have invested their lives in
industry have as much say as those who invested their money.&#8217; But
that would still leave those who had invested their money to pocket
the profits &#8211; for companies would still be run according to
profitability, not human need.</p>

<p>The most &#8216;socialist&#8217; of Benn&#8217;s demands is that when
government finance is necessary to prop up a capitalist enterprise,
it should take the form of partial state ownership (&#8216;equity&#8217;) in
the firm. This is presented as &#8216;an extension of public ownership&#8217;,
and is denounced as such by the Tories.</p>

<p>Yet it was not so long ago that the suggestion of such a policy
was denounced by a large section of the labour movement as a betrayal
of socialist principles!</p>

<p>Back in 1957 the dominant right-wing leadership in the Labour
Party sought to &#8216;revise&#8217; away its socialist programme. A document
titled <b>Industry and Society</b> was presented to Labour Party
Conference. It was opposed most vigorously by the left.</p>

<p>Jim Campbell, left-wing leader of the Railwaymen&#8217;s Union, argued:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;When you talk of controlling any industry without
owning that industry, when you talk of merely buying shares, equity
or otherwise, leaving management in the same hands, I say what you
are doing is contriving a clumsy conception of the consolidation of capitalism.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">The argument applies as much today against Benn as it applied then
against Crosland, Strachey and Gaitskell, right-wingers within the
party. It is a sign of how far the Labour Party as a whole has moved
to the right that such a scheme can be called &#8216;socialist&#8217;.</p>
<p>Finally, Benn has always kept quiet about his attitude to wages
policy. Does his &#8216;alternative economic policy&#8217; still involve wage controls?</p>

<p>Four years ago Benn wrote a pamphlet with two of his advisers,
Frances Morrell and Francis Cripps. In it they outlined a &#8216;Ten-year
Industrial Strategy&#8217;, in which they argued that the funds needed to
support firms in difficulty and for new investment should be obtained
&#8216;through taxation at the expense of consumption and living
standards ... or a planned re-allocation of public expenditure.&#8217;
These are precisely the principles behind the Labour government&#8217;s
wage controls and cuts in social services &#8211; and Benn accepted them!</p>

<p>Perhaps that is why, as Secretary for Energy, he felt able to
threaten to use troops against strikers at Windscale nuclear plant,
and was prepared to sit on the Cabinet sub-committee last winter to
implement wage controls, including drawing up plans to break the
tanker drivers&#8217; strike by using troops.</p>

<p>Where Benn differs from both the Tories and Labour leaders is not
in opposing cuts in living standards and the social services, but in
believing that these are not enough to solve the crisis of British
capitalism. He believes they must be combined with greater state
intervention &#8211; and quotes past Labour leaders such as Attlee in his
support. On occasions he has even placed himself in the same
tradition of support for state intervention as Churchill and Macmillan!</p>

<p>In this approach, Benn may find a popular rallying cry to gather
support as the Tories preside over an ever-worsening economic crisis.
But it would not allow him, in government, to behave any different to
Healey or Callaghan. He would soon find, as has every previous Labour
government, that to make &#8216;radical reforms&#8217; to the capitalist
system, you have to keep it running. And to keep it running you have
to win the &#8216;confidence&#8217; of those who hold economic power in our
society. And to do that you must protect their profits &#8211; which
means cutting the living standards of the workers.</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />

<h3>Section 3.</h3>

<a name="pt3-1"></a>
<h4>The Alternative</h4>

<p class="fst">The Labour Party has failed us. The left-wing within the Labour
Party has no socialist alternative to offer. So is this counsel of
despair for socialists?</p>

<p>Far from it. The last Tory government was driven from office
before its five years had expired because it chose confrontation with
organised working class, freezing wage levels while raising rents and
attacking trade union rights.</p>

<p>The Tories weren&#8217;t defeated then by Labour MPs &#8211; whose efforts
in the Commons did nothing to stop the &#8216;Lame Ducks&#8217; policy, the
Industrial Relations Bill or the &#8216;Fair rents&#8217; scheme &#8211; but by
the actions of organised trade unionists.</p>

<p>And not by the actions of the trade union leaders, for often &#8211;
as when the dockers forced the release of the five pickets imprisoned
under the Industrial Relations Act &#8211; the actions that defeated Tory
policies began in the face of indifference or hostility from the
union leaders.</p>

<p><b>The Times</b> reported in April 1978:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;A future Conservative government would be unable to
defeat certain powerful trade unions in a direct confrontation. That
is the advice contained in a secret report to Mrs Margaret Thatcher
by a high-level Tory group led by Lord Carrington. The group took
evidence from leading businessmen and former highly-placed civil servants.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">There is no movement in existence now that could defeat Tory
anti-working class policies. But the potential is there &#8211; in the
rank and file of the working class and the trade union movement where
the Labour Party used to have its roots, but where it is based no
more. The huge strikes of the winter 1978&#8211;79 show how much power
the workers have, if they can be persuaded to use it to change society.</p>

<p>In the winter of &#8217;79 particular groups of workers used their
strength to defend their own living standards, but not to act
together for their common interests. Local authority and hospital
workers marched in London against low pay &#8211; but the lorry drivers,
who were also striking against low pay at the time, were not there
with them. Likewise when civil servants staged one-day strikes
against low pay, few hospital workers joined their picket lines.</p>

<p>Every group of workers felt justified in protecting themselves,
but there was little feeling that they were fighting for the common
interests of all workers. The Labour government, by attacking &#8216;greedy
workers&#8217;, has caused confusion and division within the Labour
movement. Each group of workers knew they were not greedy, for they
could see their own living standards suffering, but they were unsure
of the others ...</p>

<p>Opposition to the Tory government, however, can begin to bring
unity between workers. The danger, of course, is that the united
struggle will take time to build up, as it did under the Heath
government, then Labour will nip back into office with another
version of the Social Contract and the confusion and division will
begin again.</p>

<p>There is only one way to prevent this: socialists must be active
now explaining that the struggle is not just against the Tories but
against a whole economic system that would continue to dominate our
lives whether Thatcher, Callaghan or Tony Benn were prime minister.</p>

<p>Every strike gives workers a glimpse of the strength they have to
change things. Each time socialists must be there arguing what sort
of change is needed, arguing that we don&#8217;t need a Thatcher or a
Callaghan or a Benn to change things for us, but that together
workers have the ability and strength to change things ourselves.</p>

<p>We need to bring workers together in different unions and
industries in common rank and file organisations, so that the
strength of unity in struggle can withstand any new betrayal by
left-sounding leaders, whether in parliament or the unions.</p>

<p>Bert Ellicott, who was chairperson of Stalybridge and Hyde
Constituency Labour Party until he resigned at the end of May 1979
after Labour&#8217;s General Election defeat, wrote on his resignation:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;The cynic states that revolutionary socialism is &#8220;pie
in the sky&#8221;, that man&#8217;s greed and desire for the profit motive is
inherent and that the working class do not want to know. The
suggestion is that socialism cannot happen in our affluent society &#8211;
it was suitable for Russia in 1917 and now for the underdeveloped
countries ... but one has to look positively at the situation today.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8216;More workers went on strike in January 1979 than in
the whole of such years as 1971, 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978 &#8211;
probably more than in any month since 1926 and the General Strike.
Many of them were low-paid workers who had never been on strike
before.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8216;Workers learn through struggle, especially through
their own struggle. A woman who works in my hospital consistently
voted against strike action when we had our mass meetings, but when
the majority vote went in favour of strike action she was first on
the picket line every morning. Incidents like that help to renew
faith in the power and movement of the working class.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Bert Ellicott left the Labour Party and joined the Socialist
Workers Party.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;I, for one, do not think it will be easy.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8216;I did not join the SWP for an easy ride. I did not
join the SWP because I thought it had all the answers. The answers
will become clear in struggle.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8216;I joined because at this stage in my life I have
realised the utter futility of the so-called parliamentary road to
socialism.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8216;What we must have is built-in and constant
accountability. No life leaders, no super-cadres, no parliamentary
leaders beyond recall, no elites. All members of a socialist party
have got to be actively involved and accountable at all times to
their comrades. That alone will sift the wheat from the chaff.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">So there we stand. The strength of the working class, and only
that strength, can bring socialism, can bring a society where
decisions are based on people&#8217;s needs instead of the greed of the
few for profit. Though the Labour Party has failed us, the strength
of the working class is still there &#8211; confused and much
disillusioned perhaps, but not defeated.</p>

<p>But that strength needs to be united and to see the task ahead &#8211;
and for that a new sort of party is needed, not a party like the
Labour Party which says: &#8216;Vote for us and we&#8217;ll get things done
for you&#8217;, but one which says: &#8216;Socialism is about people taking
control of their own lives &#8211; and no one, not even us, is going to
do that for you&#8217;.</p>

<p>The Socialist Workers Party is an attempt to build just such an
organisation. We work in the factories, the mines, the docks, the
offices, the housing estates &#8211; because it&#8217;s there, not in
parliamentary debating chambers and council rooms, that socialism
will be won, because it&#8217;s there that our lives need to be transformed.</p>

<p>We in the SWP do not insist that workers agree with us before we
join in struggle together &#8211; whether for better wages today, or
socialism tomorrow. As Bert Ellicott says, the answers will become
clear in struggle. So we will welcome every move by the left in the
Labour Party to fight the Tories and their attacks on workers&#8217;
lives. But we cannot hide our belief that their leaders are tied to
Labour&#8217;s parliamentary road, and that road does not lead to socialism.</p>

<p>One obstacle to building a genuine socialist party has always been
the false illusions of many workers in the Labour Party. Labour&#8217;s
failure faces us all with the problem of a right-wing Tory
government, but for many at least that obstacle is removed. Join us
and help build the socialist alternative.</p>
