<p class="fst">A year after the invasion of Czechoslovakia by half a million Russian troops, the people are still not crushed.</p>

<p>Last week hundreds of thousands protested in Prague and Brno against the Russian occupation. They were met with the only response their rulers &#8211; like those in Derry and Chicago &#8211; know: tear gas, baton changes and machine gun fire.</p>

<p>But there have been changes in the last year. Then it seemed that all sections of Czech society were opposed to the Russian invasion. The &#8216;reformers&#8217; in the governing bureaucracy, like Dubcek, Svoboda and Cernik, seemed to be leading the resistance. True, they warned against &#8216;provocations&#8217; and urged passivity, but many saw this as good tactics.</p>

<p>Today the Russians remain, although carefully hidden from view. Old Stalinists who were discredited with Novotny a year ago are back in the important positions in the bureaucracy.</p>

<p>But those &#8216;reforming&#8217; bureaucrats like Dubcek, who seemed to lead the resistance &#8211; and were accordingly portrayed in heroic terms by the western bourgeois press &#8211; are now on the other side.</p>

<p>On Sunday the Czech government issues a decree increasing sentences for those &#8216;disturbing the peace&#8217; (i.e. demonstrating against the Russians). It was signed by Dubcek, Svoboda and Cernik.</p>

<p>The reformers were prepared to partially mobilise other sections of Czech society against their opponents, but only on their own terms. When the Russians invaded they called for token strikes.</p>

<p>But they feared any movement of the mass of workers and students that might start to assert demands independent of any section of the bureaucracy.</p>
