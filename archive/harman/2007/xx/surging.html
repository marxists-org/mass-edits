<p class="fst">Three themes have run through recent issues of this journal: the
difficulties that confront US imperialism as it attempts to assert
its global hegemony through the &lsquo;war on terror&rsquo;; the
chronic problems facing European capitalism, leading to attacks on
workers&rsquo; conditions and welfare benefits in the face of
heightened economic competition from the US, Japan and China; and the
resurgence of popular movements in Latin America over the past seven
years.</P>
<P>We do not apologise for returning to all three questions here.</P>
<P>Our last issue returned from the printers just as George Bush
announced a &lsquo;surge&rsquo; of additional troops into Iraq. This
was his response to the enormous disquiet within the US ruling class
about the way the occupation was going &ndash; expressed in the
report of the Iraq Study Group headed by James Baker &ndash; and
disquiet among the mass of the population, as shown in November&rsquo;s
congressional elections (even if the victorious Democrats still
refuse to call for the withdrawal of US troops).</P>
<P>Many commentators have rightly stressed that the &lsquo;surge&rsquo;
is a huge gamble which is likely to go wrong. It also represents a
shift in US tactics. Three years ago, faced with simultaneous
uprisings in the mainly Sunni city of Fallujah and from the Shia
movement of Muqtada al-Sadr in Baghdad and southern Iraq, the US
turned to divide and rule &ndash; pouring all its fire on Fallujah
while leaving Sadr alone. Now, however, its avowed aim is to destroy
Sadr&rsquo;s movement. It wants to reduce pressure on the Iraqi
government (which depends on Sadrist votes), but it is trying to
justify its actions with talk of &lsquo;restoring order&rsquo; and
&lsquo;stopping the drift towards civil war&rsquo;. The tit for tat
bombings and assassinations are a horrific reality &ndash; and one
that did not exist before the invasion four years ago. But how deep
are the communal divisions in reality? Some on the left such as
Patrick Cockburn think they are now overwhelming. Sami Ramadani,
interviewed in this journal, disagrees with that assessment.</P>
<P>But no one would dispute that the core of the US administration,
bewildered by its dream of instant victory turning to ash, is hitting
out in all directions &ndash; without any clear idea where it is
going. Hence its backing for the Ethiopian invasion of Somalia. Hence
its moves towards &lsquo;hot pursuit&rsquo; into Pakistan from
Afghanistan, just as Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf faces his
biggest challenge since seizing power in 1999, following his decision
to sack the chief justice in March. Hence too the contradictory
messages from different voices within the US administration over
plans to bomb Iran. The overall effect is to further destabilise the
whole region. This has the potential to upset pro-American
governments like that of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, which is beset not
only by protests over election rigging but now also by a wave of
strikes by industrial workers.</P>
<P>Political &lsquo;blow back&rsquo; is not confined to the Middle
East. It finds expression in the US&rsquo;s closest ally, Britain,
where traditional Labour voters are increasingly disenchanted not
just with Tony Blair but also with his proclaimed successor, Gordon
Brown. Hence the large number of normally &lsquo;loyal&rsquo; Labour
MPs who voted in the House of Commons against the Blair-Brown scheme
to replace the Trident nuclear submarine system, and the unease among
union leaders who only 18 months ago were lauding Brown.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Back in the USA</h4>

<p class="fst">The instability is also feeding back into domestic politics in the
US as important sections of the ruling class question the gamble that
Bush has pushed them into taking. Activists on the ground in the US
can easily forget this. It is very easy for them to fall into a deep
pessimism, expressed, for instance, in an interesting article by
Robert Brenner in the January&ndash;February issue of <B>New Left Review</B>.
Brenner details the enormous setbacks for the US left in the past
three decades &ndash; the trade union movement has suffered a long
string of defeats, interspersed with very few clear victories; the
anti-capitalist movement born at the 1999 Seattle protest has
suffered setbacks in its homeland since 11 September 2001, while
going from strength to strength internationally; the promise shown by
Ralph Nader&rsquo;s attempt to break the two-party pro-capitalist and
pro-imperialist consensus of the political system has been stymied by
unstinting Democratic Party abuse since the 2000 election; and the
anti-war movement has only just shown signs of recovery from the
diversion of much activist effort into electoral support for the
Democrats, despite the party&rsquo;s refusal to oppose the
occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan.</P>
<P>What is missing from analyses such as Brenner&rsquo;s is the
impact of a ruling class taking an enormous risk, and losing. Its
members can end up turning their vitriol against each other &ndash;
and in the process providing openings through which years of
accumulated, previously apolitical, bitterness can find sudden
expression. Radical forces with the potential to take advantage of
that still exist. The people who voted for Nader in 2000 have not
gone away &ndash; and in numerical terms are comparable to those who
vote for far left parties in much of Europe. Reports tell of numerous
local activities against the war, involving thousands of people. The
networks binding activists together, especially through the internet,
are still much stronger and have much greater impact than before
Seattle. And the whole history of radical movements in the US is of
sudden upsurges that bring disconnected activists together with a
momentum that takes everyone by surprise. That was the experience of
both the mid-1930s and the late 1960s. It can be the experience again
if disillusion with Bush&rsquo;s &lsquo;war without end&rsquo;
connects with bitterness within a working class whose living
standards and working conditions are worse than 30 years ago.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>All quiet on the European front?</h4>

<p class="fst">Europe seemed superficially calm in the final months of 2006 and
the first months of this year. The presidential election campaign in
France was dominated by candidates committed to neoliberal &lsquo;reforms&rsquo;
as we went to press, despite the shockwaves caused by the No vote in
referendum on the EU constitution two years ago, the wave of riots in
the popular suburbs six months later and then, a few weeks after, the
student movement that brought millions onto the streets and forced
the government to abandon its CPE legislation attacking the workplace
rights of young people.</P>
<P>In Italy the presence of <I>Rifondazione Comunista</I> in a
government pushing through neoliberal reforms and stationing troops
in Lebanon and Afghanistan has confused and virtually paralysed what
was the biggest anti-neoliberal and anti-war movement in Europe five
years ago (even if the demonstration against the expansion of the US
base at Vicenza has given hope for the future). The leaders of
<I>Rifondazione</I> met some opposition when they expelled Franco
Turigliatto for voting against the presence of Italian troops in
Afghanistan. According to <B>Il Corriere della Sera</B> a 400-strong
meeting in solidarity with Turigliatto in Turin showed that &lsquo;it
is not only the radical movements that no longer recognise themselves
in the line of Bertinotti and <I>Rifondazione</I>&rsquo; but also
&lsquo;many of his old friends&rsquo;. However, Romano Prodi&rsquo;s
centre-left government eventually carried a vote in the chamber of
deputies in favour of its Afghan policy by 524 to three.</P>
<P>Yet before anyone declares that the &lsquo;cycle of struggle&rsquo;
is over, they should look at what has been happening in Greece,
virtually unnoticed in the international media. The student movement
that started a year ago (see the <A HREF="http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=244&amp;issue=112">article</A>
by Panos Garganas in <B>International Socialism 112</B>) against
university &lsquo;reform&rsquo; culminated in nationwide occupations
in January with the support of the lecturers&rsquo; union. The
student occupations have created a sense of national crisis, forcing
the opposition social democrat Pasok party to abandon its support for
the &lsquo;reform&rsquo; and leading to the defeat of the
government&rsquo;s attempts to amend the country&rsquo;s constitution
to allow private universities. For three months the movement was on
the front pages of national newspapers in Greece, and the government
was only able to survive because the trade union bureaucracy refused
to spread the movement among workers. As it was, the government had
to postpone other counter-reforms, such as the privatisation of the
docks, while it tried to cope with the student protests.</P>
<P>The wave of struggles that characterises Europe is not going to go
away. These struggles are systemic in the sense that they flow from
resistance to the pressure on European capitalism to take away from
the mass of people concessions made in the past, but they are not
constant. The pressure European capitalism faces is long-term; its
difficulties chronic rather than acute. That means the ruling class
can retreat when it faces sudden strong resistance (as with the EU
constitution or the CPE law), only to resume the offensive later or
on different fronts. This is connected to something we have long
argued in this journal &ndash; capitalism internationally is in a
prolonged period of recurrent crises, very different to its &lsquo;golden
age&rsquo; in the first three decades after the Second World War, but
also much more drawn out than the crisis of the inter-war years. The
political tempo is correspondingly slower, even if many of the same
features are present.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Left turns and U-turns</h4>

<p class="fst">Another factor has been very important in the cases of France,
Italy and Spain. As people see the need to go beyond individual
movements to deal with society-wide problems politics begins to play
a key role. But if the far left is too weak or does not know how to
react, the &lsquo;turn to politics&rsquo; can be of the wrong sort
and have a detrimental effect. It is open to politicians who made a
name for themselves by taking anti-neoliberal and anti-war positions
as the movement first grew (for instance <I>Rifondazione</I>&rsquo;s
Fausto Bertinotti, or, on another continent, Brazil&rsquo;s President
Lula, and even, in relation to the anti-war movement, Spain&rsquo;s
Jos&eacute; Zapatero) to use their popularity to advance their own
careers and anaesthetise the movement. Closer to home, the behaviour
of the leaders of the Republican movement in Ireland has followed a
similar trajectory, as Kieran Allen and Goretti Horgan show in their
articles in this journal.</P>
<P>Revolutionary socialists cannot prevent such things happening
simply by standing on the sidelines issuing vitriolic denunciations
of leaders who may make false moves at a later stage. Movements draw
their lifeblood from the influx of new activists with no prior
political experience. Such people are likely, initially, to put their
faith in such political leaders, and revolutionaries cannot counter
that by standing aside from the movements. Immobilism cannot win over
people who are desperate for change. But neither can revolutionaries
simply hide their own views, remaining silent on issues over which
they disagree with others. They have to be able to put across their
own arguments in a fraternal, non-hysterical, but firm manner and to
respond to new developments by presenting an orientation to which
they try to win others.</P>
<P>In Italy it was the weakness of groups of revolutionaries that
allowed Bertinotti and other <I>Rifondazione</I> leaders to get away
so easily with transforming the turn to politics into a U-turn away
from principles. There was no pole of attraction in the wider
movement that tried to provide clarity over questions such as the
role of the United Nations, the question of violence and
non-violence, the weakness of autonomist ideas, the disastrous
history of Communists supporting bourgeois governments and the old
argument over reform and revolution, or even tried to build a
continuing broad anti-war movement. When Bertinotti and <I>Rifondazione</I>
turned from studied ambiguity on all these questions to join the
centre-left government and embrace &lsquo;peacekeeping&rsquo;
imperialism, those with principles found themselves marginalised.</P>
<P>In France the problem has been the mirror image of this. Important
sections of the left opted for immobilism out of fear of political
absorption by other forces. Two years ago about 150,000 people were
active in one way or another in the No campaign against the EU
constitution. Out of this a network emerged involving some 20,000 or
30,000 activists who wanted to put forward a united anti-neoliberal
left candidate in the presidential elections, in opposition to the
main parties (and to the fascist Le Pen). The issue was whether the
organised revolutionary left would be able to relate to and influence
this network. As was to be expected, Lutte Ouvri&egrave;re kept to
its old sectarian tradition by standing completely apart from the
movement. The majority of the <I>Ligue Communiste R&eacute;volutionnaire</I>
(LCR) did make gestures towards it, only to withdraw from the
movement early last year. It was justifiably suspicious of the
Communist Party leadership, with its record of subordinating
movements to its own parliamentary games with the Socialist Party
(the Communist leader, Marie-George Buffet, was a minister in the
social-liberal &lsquo;plural left&rsquo; government of 1997&ndash;2002,
and thousands of Communist councillors owe their positions to deals
with the Socialists). But the LCR failed to seize the possibility of
forming an independent pole within the movement and helping to build
the movement&rsquo;s momentum in such a way as to isolate those who
wanted to use it as a pawn in their parliamentary games. This made it
easier for the Communist Party to try to manipulate the movement
before returning to such games a few months later (the Communists
packed a meeting to claim Buffet as the &lsquo;unity&rsquo; candidate
of the movement). It also had the effect of allowing many independent
activists (and even some in the LCR minority) to fall into the
autonomist trap of equating the manipulatory politics of the
Communists and the revolutionary politics of the LCR.</P>
<P>Exploiting such confusion, Jos&eacute; Bov&eacute; added to the
dispersal of the far left by throwing his hat into the electoral ring
as a yet another &lsquo;unity candidate&rsquo;, denouncing the LCR
candidate Olivier Besancenot as much as he denounced Buffet, and
putting forward a programme of his own which said very little about
the problems facing the country&rsquo;s 15 million manual and routine
white collar workers. Most readers will know the outcome of the first
round of the elections by the time this journal reaches you. But we
cannot help feeling an important opportunity has been lost.</P>
<P>The issues raised by recent political developments in Italy and
France are not new ones. It has often seemed to activists that the
only choice is between dissolving themselves into movement on the one
hand and immobilism on the other. One such occasion was Italy in the
years between the end of the First World War and the consolidation of
fascist rule, as <A HREF="http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=306&amp;issue=114">Megan
Trudell</A> and <A HREF="http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=307&amp;issue=114">Chris
Bambery</A> show in their articles in our collection celebrating the
revolutionary ideas of Antonio Gramsci on the seventieth anniversary
of his death.</p>
