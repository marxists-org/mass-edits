<h1>Conclusion: Knocking on History&#8217;s Door</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">As I was writing the first draft of this book, the latest wave of
revolt in Bolivia forced the Bolivian president Mesa from office.
Emails, web pages and newspaper reports painted a picture like that
of Petrograd in the summer of 1917, Berlin in January 1919 or
Barcelona in the autumn of 1936. They described general strikes;
columns of peasants marching on the city; the occupation of oil wells
and airports; striking miners handing sticks of gelignite to striking
teachers to throw against police lines; attempts to invade the
presidential palace; threats by petro-capitalists in the east of the
country to secede from the state; workers in La Paz chanting, &#8216;Civil
War, Yes!&#8217;; the congress replacing the president while intimidated
by huge, angry crowds. Yet they also finally described a truce
between the two sides, with an end to the strikes and the departure
of demonstrators from La Paz.</p>

<p>Karl Marx once wrote about the &#8216;mole of history&#8217;, which bores
away beneath the surface of events, suddenly revealing itself by
undermining apparently all-powerful institutions. So it was in Bolivia.</p>

<p>The 1980s and 1990s had been terrible decades for the mass of the
Bolivian people, just as they were in much of the rest of Latin
America. Economic devastation was accompanied by neoliberal reforms
resulting in living standards, already on a par with those in
sub-Saharan Africa, sinking even lower. The working class was ravaged
by closures, with the mass sacking of 20,000 tin miners (half the
national total) in 1985. Politics became a game played between
members of the white elite. The peasants, clinging to the plots of
land given to them after a revolution in 1952, remained indifferent
to calls for further struggle and the Bolivian left, once an
important force, was a shadow of its former self.</p>

<p>Yet, barely noticeably, changes were slowly creating new forces
able to challenge the established order. The peasantry began to find
that its land was no longer secure, as agriculture became
increasingly subject to market forces making it difficult for small
farmers to hold on to what they had. The one crop with sure market
potential, coca (from which cocaine is manufactured), was soon under
threat from the US &#8216;war on drugs&#8217;. The penetration of even the
most remote villages by modern communications increased the
consciousness of oppression among the indigenous two thirds of the
country&#8217;s population, the Aymara and Quechua peoples, whose first
language is not Spanish. They began to organise against the inferior
position imposed on them ever since the Spanish conquest of the Inca
Empire 470 years ago, recalling with pride past risings in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>

<p>Finally, the decline of other older industries was accompanied by
the rise of a new working class. Indigenous people left the poverty
of the countryside to find a livelihood in places like El Alto, the
huge impoverished conurbation that hangs over the capital city, La
Paz. So, while many commentators argued that Bolivia was undergoing
&#8216;deindustrialisation&#8217; and that the country&#8217;s working class was
disappearing, the number of manufacturing workers actually rose &#8211;
from 117,000 in the major cities in 1986 to 231,000 in 1995, with 38
per cent in workplaces of more than 30. These figures were matched by
growing numbers of construction workers and miners of other metals
than tin. By 1997, there were nearly as many wage earners &#8211;
1,400,000 &#8211; as there were peasants.</p>

<p>It was the logic of capitalism itself that gave active life to
these new forces. The privatisation of water supplies in the
Cochabamba region pushed up water prices for workers and peasants
alike, causing tens of thousands to demonstrate, fight against the
police and to discover in 2001 that by blocking roads they could
bring the country as a whole to a halt. Success in beating
privatisation in Cochabamba led to emulation of the tactics
elsewhere, with protests and blockades by the coca growers and
indigenous organisations. This example in turn created a new spirit
of struggle in working class areas like El Alto and breathed life
into the previously quiescent union federation, the COB, with the
election of new leaders.</p>

<p>News that the government of the neoliberal president Lozada was
selling off the country&#8217;s one great prospect for wealth, its
recently discovered gas reserves, to multinationals brought the
ferment to a head in October 2003. What began as spasmodic agitation
suddenly erupted into mass strikes and confrontations after the
police shot down scores of protesters marching towards La Paz. It was
then that El Alto became the centre of the movement. It was then too
that miners rediscovered their old traditions and militancy by
marching with gelignite in clenched fists to join the masses in the capital.</p>

<p>The October rising led Lozada to flee the country in a helicopter
(the third Latin American president to do so in three years). But
there was neither the consciousness nor the organisation among the
hundreds of thousands of protesters in La Paz and El Alto to
determine who replaced him. His deputy, Mesa, took his place in the
presidential palace and the mass of demonstrators departed, believing
they had won a great victory but neoliberal policies continued as
before. The next day at an expanded meeting of the COB union,
delegate after delegate lamented the fact that they had not been able
to raise the idea of a workers and peasants government.</p>

<p>As is often the case in revolutionary upheavals, the first
successful uprising was followed by a period of precarious stability.
The new government made attempts to divert popular anger into
nationalist agitation against Chile, which had annexed Bolivia&#8217;s
coastal region and blocked its access to the sea more than a century
before. President Mesa held a referendum over the gas issue and
managed to get away with phrasing the issue in such a way as to get a
majority. Attempts at new mobilisations never seemed to get up a head
of steam to repeat the October events.</p>

<p>An important factor in the impasse that followed October 2003 was
the way, as also in past revolutionary upheavals, certain political
figures and formations that had helped to lead the movement forward
at previous stages now no longer did so. Indigenous leaders like
Felipe Quispe of the Union of Peasant Workers had played an important
role in articulating grievances against the Spanish speaking white
elite who dominated official politics. But they allowed justified
resentment at past treatment by the mestizo (mixed race Spanish
speaking) section of the masses to divert them from pushing forward
the struggle against the common enemy.</p>

<p>Evo Morales and his MAS party was the other channel for indigenous
bitterness. They called for a constituent assembly to remould the
country&#8217;s political institutions to reflect its ethnic make up. But
dazzled by the large vote for president that Morales received in
2002, they followed a strategy of keeping a weak Mesa in power so
that Morales would eventually have the chance of succeeding him by
constitutional means in 2007 and so they urged a &#8216;yes&#8217; vote in
Mesa&#8217;s gas referendum.</p>

<p>The COB union leaders took a more left wing stance, denouncing the
gas referendum and urging people to abstain or spoil their ballot
papers. But their traditions were still very much that of the old
working class, and had little influence among the newly radicalised
indigenous forces, treating as a diversion their demand to be part of
a new democratic political structure. As a result, Mesa not only
stayed in office for 21 months, but for most of that period enjoyed a
degree of support among many of those who had taken to the streets in
October 2003.</p>

<p>But things do not simply stand still when a mass movement gets
stuck in an impasse. Those associated with the old order forget their
fright and began to reassert their belief in their god-given right to
rule. Mesa&#8217;s government became increasingly like the overthrown
Lozada government, preparing a law which left the majority of the gas
and oil profits in private hands. Meanwhile in the lowland region in
the east of the country around the city of Santa Cruz, where the gas
and oil reserves are located, capitalist interests insisted that they
would declare autonomy from the rest of the country if there was an
attempt to use petroleum wealth for any purposes other than their
own. They looked to support from the US and the supposedly left
centre governments of Brazil and Argentina, whose oil companies are
involved with Shell and BP in profiting from Bolivia&#8217;s petroleum resources.</p>

<p>This was the spark which reignited the urban and rural masses in
June 2005. They saw the one chance of using the country&#8217;s wealth to
overcome their poverty snatched away from them. They moved as they
had 21 months previously to close down the whole country and besieged
the presidential palace and congress.</p>

<p>The ruling class was paralysed. Mesa tried to hold on by balancing
between the secessionists in Santa Cruz and the mass movement. He
promised a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution in a way
that would please Morales and his supporters and a referendum on
autonomy that would please the Santa Cruz petro-capitalists.
Condoleezza Rice pledged her support for Mesa, and Morales opposed
driving him from office. But the movement on the streets was more
powerful and more radical than ever. The nationalist language
opposing gas profits going to foreigners now became class demands for
gas nationalisation in the interests of the workers, the peasants and
the urban poor.</p>

<p>When it became clear Mesa was beyond saving, the Congress decamped
to Sucre from La Paz in the hope of escaping the siege and resolving
things according to the wishes of its neoliberal majority. They
placed their hopes briefly in Mesa&#8217;s constitutional successor, Vaca
Diez, a representative of the Santa Cruz oligarchy. But it was
already too late. They were besieged in Sucre too, as the workers
movement paralysed all transport across the country. Congress passed
over Vaca Diez to appoint as interim president Eduardo Rodriguez,
head of the supreme court &#8211; but for six months only before elections.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church urged a &#8216;truce&#8217;,
warning of the dangers of &#8216;extremism&#8217;, the Brazilian and
Argentine governments applied pressure, and the US ambassador gave
his seal of approval to the deal. After hectic negotiations, Evo
Morales too backed it when he was assured there would be elections
and the constituent assembly (a key factor in his decision, according
to the reputable Buenos Aires paper <strong>Clarin</strong> was a cell phone
call from Hugo Chavez advising him to do so). It was enough to signal
the end of the demonstrations and a return to work by most of the
strikers, tired after three weeks of struggle and suffering from food
shortages as the road blockades stopped food arriving in the cities.</p>

<p>The Bolivian events illustrate all the points made in this book.
The globalisation of capitalism tears people&#8217;s lives apart, often
demoralising them at first, but then pushing them into situations
where they feel they have no choice but to fight back. Precisely
because capitalism cannot manage without an exploited class, it
creates a new working class with the power to fight just as it
destroys much of the old working class. Bolivia also demonstrates how
a successful struggle can suddenly inspire a score of others and as
this happens apparently forgotten traditions of solidarity and
insurgency are reborn. With this, people&#8217;s attitudes to each other
and to the state begin to be transformed, until they can conceive of
a revolution taking place with the working class becoming the ruling
class and the mass of people taking control of their own lives.</p>

<p>But Bolivia also shows how these things by themselves are not
enough to bring about the change which people want. The movement
paralysed the structures of power of existing society. But it never
posed an alternative of its own. Without such an alternative, even
feeding its own supporters was an insuperable problem. As the
coordinating committee of the struggle in Cochabamba put it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We have seen two things in the May&#8211;June struggle. On the
one side, the magnificent force of the social movements is capable of
paralysing the country and dealing with the manoeuvres of big
business and the bad governments. On the other side, we have not been
capable of imposing our own decisions and objectives on these same
governments, although they are in the worst crisis they could face ...</p>

<p class="fst">In the June crisis there was a moment when the whole question of
who held power in society was in the balance. One can never be sure
in such circumstances whether the workers and peasants movements
could have taken power into their own hands. The solidity of
discipline in the army and police in such a potentially revolutionary
situation can only be tested in practice &#8211; you engage in battle and
then you see. But on this occasion the decisive battle was not engaged.</p>

<p>There was a potentially revolutionary situation in Bolivia. The
ruling class was divided. The working class, the peasantry, the urban
poor, even the mass of self-employed street traders felt things could
not continue as before. There were signs that sections of the army
were wobbling. But two additional elements needed to turn the
potential into reality did not exist &#8211; there was no workers&#8217;
council or other popular form of revolutionary democracy that could
unite the whole of the popular masses into a single organism standing
in opposition to the old state. Nor did there exist an organised
network of revolutionaries, a party, drawing together the most
determined and militant activists in each of the various fronts of
struggle that had emerged since the first victory in Cochabamba.</p>

<p>In the last days of the June struggle some activists did begin to
look towards creating structures from below that could provide the
first elements of democratic forms of self organisation. There was an
initiative in El Alto for a Popular Revolutionary Assembly to take
control of the city, to defend and feed it. In Cochabamba, the
coordinating committee drew the conclusion that there had to be
discussion about how to &#8216;little by little create forms of our own
self government.&#8217; But these initiatives came too late and with too
little impetus to influence the outcome in June. People talked of an
El Alto Commune but it never came into being.</p>

<p>The Bolivian struggle is far from over. The impact of the
near-revolutionary events in June 2005 was to sweep Evo Morales to
electoral office as president in December of that year on a programme
of progressive reforms. But capitalism cannot satisfy the aroused
hopes of the workers, peasants and indigenous peoples. Even the
limited reform measures that have been implemented have roused the
rich in Santa Cruz to build armed organisations that threaten to tear
the country in two.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what will happen next. But the real
importance of the Bolivian events is not what they mean for one
relatively small country. It is that they show how the endless
uncertainty that characterises global capitalism repeatedly breeds
potentially revolutionary resistance. The same spirit of resistance
is to be seen in Venezuela. As in Bolivia, a government pledged to
satisfy the needs of the mass of people still rules over a capitalist
society, with massive concentrations of private wealth and enormous
inequality. But also as in Bolivia, the surging desire for change
from below, expressed in very large government demonstrations for
&#8216;revolution&#8217; and &#8216;socialism of the 21st century&#8217;, has created
a rift between the classes. This will have to be resolved at some
point in the future either by creation of a new state based on the
democracy of workers and other exploited groups, or by the return of
the old order.</p>

<p>Resistance is not confined to Bolivia and Venezuela, or even to
Latin America. It is beginning make its mark on every continent.
Things cannot be otherwise, since globalisation means global economic
crisis, a global war drive, global environmental devastation and all
the social convulsions that come in the train of such things. The
rulers of Europe and North America tell workers they have no future
unless they lower their wages, lengthen their working hours and
worsen their conditions in order to compete with the workers of India
and China. All this can only mean that there will be bitter class
battles in the most advanced parts of the capitalist system as well
as in the poorer parts.</p>

<p>None of this guarantees successful socialist revolution anywhere.
Those who defend the existing system spend billions on arms; they
have their police and their secret police, bribes for those who dance
to their tune, a squalid gutter press, long experience of dividing
and ruling and the ability to rely on habits of deference among those
they oppress. Those who think nothing of blasting tens of thousands
of people to death in order to establish their control over oil wells
will do anything to try to stop a challenge to all their wealth and
power. And yet they cannot break their dependence on us, the four or
five billion people who labour for them in factories, fields, mines,
offices, railway networks, truck depots, warehouses, power stations.
Without our class they are nothing. And since their system cannot
guarantee a fixed, stable existence for our class, revolts will flare
up again and again in the present century as in the last. The
question is not whether there will be revolutions in the century
ahead, but in which direction those revolutions will go. Will they be
snuffed out, as so often in the last century, as people put their
trust in the lies and false promises of those who rule over them? Or
will the new movement of the last few years rise to the task of
uniting into revolutionary organisations all those among the
exploited and oppressed able to see a little further than their
fellows the evils of the system and the possibilities of overthrowing it.</p>
