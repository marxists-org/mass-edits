<h3>Revolution in the 21st Century</h3>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h1>Introduction: Everything to fight for</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">The fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the decaying
dictatorships of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in 1989-91
supposedly ended the struggle to replace capitalism with something
better. Yet the first years of this century have seen a new spirit of
resistance across the world.</p>

<p>It began just before the new century itself with the
demonstrations around the World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle
in November 1999. The slogan &#8216;Another world is possible&#8217;
resonated across continents, with ever larger and more militant
protests in Prague, Melbourne, Dakar, Gothenburg and Genoa. The
resistance then merged into the biggest movement against war the
world has ever seen &#8211; tens of millions taking to the streets of
major cities on 15 February 2003 &#8211; while in Latin America, popular
uprisings overthrew governments from Argentina to Ecuador.</p>

<p>The resistance has grown deeper and drawn in wider numbers of
people everywhere. In 2005 voters in France and the Netherlands threw
established politics into turmoil by rejecting a European
constitution that aimed to slash restraints on market forces. Later
in the same year immigrant communities across France exploded in
rage. 2006 saw French students leading millions of workers in
successful protests against attempts to scrap the employment rights
of young people, Venezuela&#8217;s president Hugo Chavez declared his
intention to implement &#8216;socialism for the 21st century&#8217;, and an
uprising toppled the government of Nepal. In Oaxaca, Mexico, a
teachers&#8217; strike turned into a rebellion that drove the army and
police from the city, while students in Chile and Greece followed the
French example. By the time you read this, the resistance will have
found fresh forms of expression and shaken the established order in
new ways &#8211; and the numbers beginning to seek political answers
outside those offered by the existing system will have grown.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 1990s we were promised a &#8216;new world
order&#8217; and told we had reached &#8216;the end of history&#8217;. Capitalism
was the only option for humanity, it was said, but there was no cause
for worry because a &#8216;new economic paradigm&#8217; had banished economic crisis.</p>

<p>How quickly the illusions were shattered. For most people, even in
more prosperous parts of the world, life has become more burdensome
and less secure. An economic crisis at the beginning of the new
century cost millions of jobs in the US, which an economic revival
has not restored. Japan has suffered 12 years of economic stagnation,
and the economies of continental Europe have proved incapable of
denting an unemployment rate of 10 per cent. In the US, the richest
society in history, 90 per cent of the population have seen no
improvement in living standards in the past 30 years and half are
worse off. This is despite an increase in the time spent at work by
the average male worker in the US of 160 hours a year &#8211; equivalent
to about one month. For women workers it is worse &#8211; on average they
spend an additional 200 hours at work in a year. In Germany, the five
million on the dole have had their benefits cut. In France, one-fifth
of young people are jobless and others can find nothing more than
insecure McJobs. In Britain, we face the longest working hours in
Europe, yet more than half the children across swathes of London grow
up in poverty.</p>

<p>Life in much of the rest of the world is incomparably worse. In
sub-Saharan Africa average living standards have fallen steadily for
30 years. Hundreds of millions struggle each day to obtain the 2,000
calories a day required for life. There are periodic famines and tens
of thousands of children die each day from malnutrition or diseases
that have long been treatable &#8211; diarrhoea, dysentery, tuberculosis,
malaria. In Latin America, poverty is not just the fate of millions
in Nicaragua, Guatemala, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru who have been poor
for generations; it is the fate of tens of millions in the more
economically advanced countries &#8211; Argentina, Mexico and Brazil.</p>

<p>Apologists for the system talk of the growth of China and India,
omitting to mention that prosperity for the 10 or 20 per cent of
people who make up the middle classes leaves hundreds of millions in
desperate poverty in the countryside. Hence, 150 million Chinese
migrate to the cities each year to traipse the streets as casual
labourers, and an epidemic of suicide convulses communities of
indebted farmers in the more &#8216;prosperous&#8217; states of India.</p>

<p>Poverty is not the only nightmare for a huge section of the
world&#8217;s people. Many suffer the barbarity of modern warfare. The
proclamation of the New World Order has been followed by one war
after another, with the US taking the lead in pouring death and
destruction on cities halfway around the world. The most modern
conventional weapons are used, supplied by companies that boast of
their competitive success in selling them. The casualties are
overwhelmingly civilians &#8211; blown apart by bombs dropped from 30,000
feet, blasted by guns firing thousands of rounds a minute, buried in
their homes by rockets and tanks.</p>

<p>When people direct bombs against civilians in the cities of the
west, they are denounced as evil terrorists and abhorrent to
civilisation. Yet horrors 1,000 times worse are inflicted on
civilians elsewhere in the world. Our leaders warn of weapons of mass
destruction, while insisting on their right to stockpile nuclear
warheads and construct missile systems. People from an Islamic
background who turn to religious-based politics in reaction to
foreign domination and devastation are denounced, but a US president
can launch wars on Afghanistan and Iraq while claiming he obeys the
will of God.</p>

<p>Alongside the old horrors of poverty and war, the 21st century
brings a new one &#8211; climate change. If unchecked, the rise in
temperatures caused by greenhouse gases from carbon fuels will melt
the polar ice caps, change ocean currents and weather patterns, turn
fertile areas to desert, bring crop-destroying storms and flood
immense low-lying regions such as Bangladesh, the Nile Delta and
Florida. Hurricane Katrina, which came close to destroying New
Orleans, gave a foretaste of what to expect. Most of the world&#8217;s
governments admit something must be done, but retreat from measures
to curtail emissions lest any group of capitalists lose out.</p>

<p>All these evils have a single cause in the capitalist system. More
than two billion people work each day to produce more wealth than
there has ever been &#8211; more than enough to provide sufficient food
for everyone and to overcome poverty. Yet people go hungry in one
part of the world while farmers elsewhere are paid to leave fields
uncultivated. The organisation of production in a system based on
rival companies, each motivated by the drive to compete for profit,
is the root cause.</p>

<p>At the top of the biggest companies are a select group of
extraordinarily wealthy individuals. There are about 350 billionaires
in the world. The top 200 have more than $1 trillion ($1,000 billion)
in assets. The three wealthiest are worth as much the 48 poorest
countries combined. Such individuals have a controlling stake in the
multinational corporations, about 200 of which &#8211; run by perhaps
1,500 people &#8211; have a combined turnover equal to more than
one-quarter of the world output. Of these 200 multinationals, 168 are
based in five countries &#8211; the US, Japan, Germany, the UK and
France. The five biggest, run by perhaps 40 people, have a greater
output than the Middle East and Africa combined, and double the
output of South Asia.</p>

<p>These few individuals decide what to produce and where, who will
have jobs and who will be condemned to poverty. Their economic power
gives them enormous political power in countries where they operate,
and they pressure states to fulfil their desires &#8211; through bodies
like the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade
Organisation, and by direct military means. It is capitalism that
produces this imperialism, with the ruling classes of a handful of
countries &#8211; led by the US &#8211; prepared to use any barbarity to get
their way.</p>

<p>Wherever there is poverty, oppression, war or environmental
destruction there are always numbers of people who resist. The 19th
and 20th centuries saw successive movements of resistance that gave
birth to the ideas of socialism and communism, and the 21st century
has already produced fresh movements. There are millions looking for
an alternative to the present system and asking questions. What do we
do about the power of the billionaires, the corporations and the
states that further their interests? Is it possible to overturn that
power? Could we rebuild society on a different basis?</p>

<p>And how do we avoid the dream of another world turning into a
nightmare like Stalin&#8217;s Russia or simply a repackaged version of
market madness? This book attempts to answer some of those questions
by looking at how rulers have been overthrown at various points in
the 200 years during which industrial capitalism has come to dominate
the world, at the alternatives people have posed to it, and at the
possibilities for revolution today.</p>
