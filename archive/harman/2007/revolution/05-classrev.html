<h3>Revolution in the 21st Century</h3>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h1>5: Class and Revolution</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">Revolutionary socialists believe the working class is the key to
transforming society. This follows from the character of capitalist
society. Capitalists cannot survive without making profits, but they
cannot do that without bringing workers together to exploit and thus
creating discontent. This is what Marx meant when he wrote that
capitalism creates its own &#8216;gravedigger&#8217;.</p>

<p>Ruling classes before capitalism also exploited the mass of the
population. But they did so mainly by exploiting peasants dispersed
across the countryside, each family tending its own land, living in
villages or hamlets with little connection between them, speaking
localised dialects, unable to read and write, and possessing little
understanding of the wider world.</p>

<p>Capitalism, by contrast, concentrates those it exploits in giant
cities, in workplaces where improved conditions can only be obtained
through collective struggle. In order to exploit workers to the
maximum, capitalists demand a level of literacy and numeracy higher
than that among most of the exploiting classes of the past. In doing
so, the system creates a class with the capacity to organise against
it and the potential to turn society on its head.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Reality of Class Today</h4>

<p class="fst">The revolutionary movements of the 20th century were centred on
the industrial working class. Innumerable academics and media pundits
argue this makes workers irrelevant to the question of revolution
today because the working class has declined as a force. If there is
talk of demands for change it is couched in terms of &#8216;multitudes&#8217;
and &#8216;social movements&#8217;.</p>

<p>There is no doubt the proportion of people employed in
manufacturing and mining has declined in Britain and certain other
advanced industrial countries. The number in manufacturing in Britain
today is about half that of 1973. But this does not mean the
industrial working class has disappeared &#8211; its numbers were still
growing in the US until only six years ago and even in Britain there
are still millions of such workers. More importantly, the notion of
the working class cannot be restricted to those in particular industries.</p>

<p>The media, politicians and academics treat class as a question of
lifestyles or, following the German sociologist Max Weber, &#8216;life
chances&#8217;. Their starting point is the way people dress and speak,
the character of the jobs they do, the degree to which they are held
in esteem or extent to which they live in poverty. This leads to the
assertion that we live in an increasingly middle-class society, since
the proportion doing heavy manual work has declined while increasing
numbers work in white-collar, service sector jobs. We live in a
&#8216;two-thirds, one-third&#8217; society, it is claimed, in which most
people prosper and a minority make up an &#8216;underclass&#8217;.</p>

<p>Many on the left see class in similar ways &#8211; identifying a
&#8216;labour aristocracy&#8217; of skilled, male manual workers and an
impoverished underclass, or portraying industrial manual workers as
&#8216;proletarian&#8217; and white-collar and service-sector workers as
middle class.</p>

<p>These theories obscure the fact that the fundamental divide in
society is between those who control the means of production and
those who work for them. Lifestyle, dress, income and consumption are
products of this division, not its cause. It is irrelevant if
occasional members of the possessing class choose to slum it, or if
some of the toilers gain marginal advantages and imitate aspects of
the lifestyle of their exploiters. The fact that the head of Barclays
and a counter clerk in a branch of the bank both wear suits does not
bridge the gap between them. The bank clerk, computer operator and
call centre employee are compelled to accept voluntary wage-slavery,
five days a week, 48 weeks a year, just as much as a car worker or docker.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Restructuring and the Continuity of Class</h4>

<p class="fst">The competition at the core of capitalism means firms repeatedly
restructure production to try to get ahead of rivals and to survive
recurrent crises. This leads to the repeated restructuring of the
labour force. Some groups of workers diminish in size and others
expand. So in Britain in the 1830s and 1840s the biggest
concentrations of workers were in textiles. When people thought of
the typical worker, they thought of someone in a cotton mill. Forty
years later, whole new branches of industry were expanding and people
increasingly identified the working class with those in heavy
industry &#8211; the shipyards and mines. By the Second World War things
had changed again, with a great expansion of jobs in the car
industry, electrical goods and light manufacturing.</p>

<p>At each stage people looked at the changing lifestyles of those
around them and concluded the militant working class of the past was
gone. Around 1870 Thomas Cooper, a former activist in the Chartist
movement 30 years earlier, surveyed the workers of the north of
England and:</p>

<p class="quoteb">noticed with pain that their moral and intellectual
conditions had deteriorated ... In our old Chartist times, it is
true, Lancashire working men were in rags by the thousands; and many
of them lacked food. But their intelligence was demonstrated wherever
you went. You would see them in groups discussing the great doctrines
of social justice ... they were in earnest dispute respecting the
teachings of socialism. Now you will see no such groups in
Lancashire. But you will hear well dressed working men talking of
cooperative stores and their shares in them, or in building
societies. And you will see others, like idiots, leading small
greyhound dogs, covered with cloth, on a string ... Working men had
ceased to think ... [Quoted in Max Beer, <strong>A History of British
Socialism</strong>, 1940].</p>

<p class="fst">Some 70 years later the idea that the old working class had
disappeared became fashionable again. A broadsheet of the
government&#8217;s Central Office of Information declared in 1962 that
British society was characterised by a &#8216;swelling middle class&#8217;.
There could be no return to the working class conditions of the 1930s
because: &#8216;The average man ... has made too great an investment in
his own future as a middle class citizen and householder&#8217; (quoted
in John Goldthorpe, David Lockwood and others, <strong>The Affluent Worker
in the Class Structure</strong>, Cambridge 1969).</p>

<p>There was a serious academic discussion as to whether &#8216;affluent&#8217;
car workers were &#8216;embourgeoisified&#8217;. Labour Party theorist
Anthony Crosland wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">One cannot imagine today a deliberate offensive alliance
between government and the employers on the 1921 or 1925&#8211;6 model,
with all the paraphernalia of wage cuts, national lockouts and
anti-union legislation; or a serious attempt to enforce a coal
policy; to which the miners bitterly objected [C.A.R. Crosland, <strong>The
Future of Socialism</strong>, London, 1956].</p>

<p class="fst">Yet a wave of workers&#8217; struggles began in the late 1960s,
culminating in confrontations that shook society as much as those of
the 1920s, forcing a Tory government out of office in 1974. At the
heart of the militancy were supposedly affluent workers in the car,
mining and printing industries. And the militancy was not finally
destroyed until the defeat of the miners in a year-long strike in
1984&#8211;85 that involved the police occupation of the mining areas.</p>

<p>The restructuring of industry changes the working class and
confuses observers, but it cannot do away with the central features
of capitalism that lead to recurrent waves of class struggle.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Working Class in the 21st Century</h4>

<p class="fst">The restructuring of capitalism in the advanced countries is
characterised by two trends: a growing proportion of the workforce is
made up of white-collar workers, and service employment is growing
more quickly than industrial employment. The trends should not be
confused. Many service jobs are manual (bus drivers, dockers, refuse
collectors) while a considerable proportion of manufacturing
employees are white collar (progress chasers, design office staff).
But the trends can give a misleading impression of what is happening
to the class structure if you identify the working class solely with
manual industrial workers.</p>

<p>What has not changed, despite all the transformations in work
brought about by restructuring, is the fact that the system is based
on competition between rival firms. This leads companies to do their
utmost to pump the maximum profit out of their workforce. As a
section of workers grows in size, then the pressure on them to
produce profits increases.</p>

<p>When white-collar work was the prerogative of a relatively small
number of male clerks in the 19th century, capitalism could afford to
provide them with better salaries and conditions than the mass of
manual workers. But 21st century capitalism depends on vast numbers
of white-collar workers doing routine jobs. Many work for private
firms in banks, insurance companies and advertising agencies. Others
are employed by the state to carry out functions important to the
system as a whole &#8211; training the next generation of workers,
collecting taxes, protecting property, keeping people fit for work.
These workers are exploited through the same methods as manual
workers. Job evaluation methods pioneered in the textile mills, steel
plants and on car assembly lines are applied to civil servants,
teachers and even university lecturers.</p>

<p>One consequence of this change is that such groups now engage in
characteristically working-class forms of struggle. In Britain,
strikes by teachers, civil servants, lecturers, journalists, nurses
and white-collar workers in local government were virtually unknown
until the late 1960s. They have become as normal as strikes by
old-style manual workers in the last 30 years.</p>

<p>Modern capitalist society is divided into two main groups as
clearly as the 19th society analysed by Marx or described in the
novels of Charles Dickens. There is a small minority who have enough
wealth to live a life of leisure if they wish, and there is a great
mass of people who can only make a livelihood if they work for this minority.</p>

<p>This division is more important than any other in society. It
determines how much control you have over your life &#8211; whether you
enjoy real choices or whether everything you do is subordinated to
the need to work for others. It even determines how long you are
likely to live, with the employing class in Britain today expecting
to live, on average, more than 10 years longer than the rest of us.
It determines the quality of the clothes you wear, the car you drive,
the food you eat and the goods you own. All the factors usually taken
to indicate class are effects of this division. Analyse Britain
according to this basic division and you find well over 75 per cent
of people are working class, in the sense of depending for their
livelihood on selling their labour to the minority.</p>

<p>Not all service employees or salaried staff are workers. In any
society there are gradations between the small minority at the top
and the mass of people at the bottom. In a slave society there are
not just slave owners and slaves, but also a layer of slave drivers,
who receive a small share of the wealth that comes from exploiting
the slaves. In a capitalist society, there are a mass of small
capitalists and self-employed business people as well as the major
capitalists. There is also a layer of managers, top civil servants,
police chiefs and so on who are paid much more than the value of any
labour they perform in return for helping big capital exploit the
mass of people. This layer is organised through bureaucratic
hierarchies. Those at the top partake fully in the fruits of
exploitation and have common interests with big capital. Those at the
bottom get very little from exploitation and share many interests
with the white-collar and manual workers below them. Low-grade
supervisors and line managers are paid a little more those they order
around, but rely on the same public services and can be hit just as
hard by workplace closures and redundancies.</p>

<p>The presence of this middle layer obscures the basic divide
between the exploiting and exploited classes. But it does not do away
with it any more than the slope between a hill and a valley does away
with the contrast between the two. Far from making up the majority of
society, this middle class proper amounts at most to 15-20 per cent
of the population.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Insecurity and Struggle</h4>

<p class="fst">Another argument you hear about workers today is that
globalisation has created such massive insecurity in employment that
it is all but impossible to develop the strong workers&#8217;
organisations that existed in the past. Far from workers being able
to challenge the state, they find themselves barely able to fight an
individual employer.</p>

<p>This argument suffers from two inter-related faults. First,
workers have often succeeded in organising and fighting back against
employers despite massive levels of job insecurity. Take the case of
London&#8217;s dockers in 1889. This was a group with no security of
employment. Gareth Stedman Jones&#8217; book <strong>Outcast London</strong> quotes
the findings of a parliamentary select committee on conditions in the
docks in 1888:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Bribery and favouritism were the normal means of gaining
employment in the docks. Treating the foreman to beer on the evening
before was a frequent means of gaining employment in the docks the
next day. Casuals in the docks applied daily for dock work at gates
where they were known by the foreman. This could not assure them a
day&#8217;s work, since the foreman always employed a proportion of
outsiders in order to increase the size of the casual pool. On the
other hand, the foreman could punish long term absence on the part of
the casual workers by withdrawing his patronage. It was this
precarious dependence of the casual upon the foreman that maintained
the casual fringe intact.</p>

<p class="fst">Beatrice Webb, one of the founders of the reformist Fabian Society
described the position of dock labour in 1887 as &#8216;very hopeless&#8217;.
&#8216;The employers were content and the men, although far from content,
were entirely disorganised,&#8217; she wrote.</p>

<p>Conditions were not much more secure for metal and textile workers
in the Russian capital St Petersburg at the end of 1904. According to
historian Gerald Surh:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The turnover within the factory workforce in Petersburg
seems to have been quite high ... Unskilled and semi-skilled workers
were normally more volatile because they were more easily replaced
... The lack of organisation and therefore protection at the
workplace meant that the inevitable dispute between workers and
foremen and managers were ... frequently resolved ... by resignation
or dismissal [Gerald Surh, <strong>1905 in St Petersburg</strong>, Stanford 1989]</p>

<p class="fst">In both cases, mass strikes transformed the situation and
encouraged hundreds of thousands of other workers to throw up new
organisations of their own. When the London dockers struck in 1889,
they shut down the city&#8217;s international trade for five weeks, won
their economic demands and built a union of 25,000 members. Beatrice
Webb highlighted the change:</p>

<p class="quoteb">What the men had achieved through organisation was not to
be measured solely by advantage achieved in pay or the conditions of
employment ... We see the effect in the changed attitude of the
employers as to casual employment.</p>

<p class="fst">In Petersburg, the transformation was even more dramatic. The
unorganised workers of 1904 exploded into action after management
victimised a woodworker in the Putilov plant. As Surh writes: &#8216;A
mass meeting of 2 January, attended by about 6,000 workers ...
enthusiastically voted for a strike at the Putilov plant ... By
Friday 7 January, 382 enterprises were on strike.&#8217; When the Tsar&#8217;s
troops fired on a peaceful demonstration, the strike spread across
the city and began a year of revolutionary upheaval that came close
to overthrowing the regime.</p>

<p>Such a sudden discovery of the power to fight back collectively
can occur among the restructured working class of the 21st century.
We have already had glimpses of it. In the forefront of the uprisings
in Bolivia in 2003 and 2005 were workers from the mass of small
workshops in the city of El Alto. The spring of 2006 brought sudden,
unexpected strikes and riots in the giant textile factories of
Bangladesh, and January 2007 saw strikes and factory occupations by
workers in Egypt.</p>

<p>Capitalist restructuring can certainly decimate old-established
sectors of industry and weaken the power of groups of workers that
used to be among the best organised, as happened with the defeats of
the miners and newspaper printers in Britain in the mid-1980s. But
the same restructuring leads to a growth in the importance of new
groups. Neither the postal workers nor London tube workers were
regarded as militant or powerful in Britain in the 1970s, but they
have become so in recent years. We can expect other groups, at
present largely unorganised &#8211; like those working in finance, call
centres and supermarkets &#8211; to follow at some point. The very logic
of capitalism creates discontent among those it exploits and
oppresses, and at some point this bitterness will explode. The key
question is not whether it will happen, but whether it will prove successful.</p>

<p>The second major fault with the argument that precarious
employment prevents workers from struggling is that, in most
countries, it is a minority of workers who are in casual jobs. A
study by the International Labour Organisation concludes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">While this type of employment increased substantially
during the first half of the 1990s, the relative proportions of
permanent and non-permanent jobs remained almost unchanged between
1995 and the year 2000: permanent (82 per cent), non-permanent (18 per cent).</p>

<p class="fst">The average conceals large divergences between countries, with a
high point of 35 per cent of workers in insecure employment in Spain.
In Britain, according to the government statistical publication
<strong>Social Trends</strong>: &#8216;As many as 92 per cent of workers held
permanent employment contracts in 2000 as compared with 88 per cent
who did eight years earlier.&#8217;</p>

<p>Even in third world countries such as India and Pakistan, where
millions of workers move each year from the countryside to cities
seeking work, there is relative security of employment for some
sections. Employers like to have a stable element in their labour
force, to stop other employers poaching experienced workers when
trade is booming and to encourage workers to identify with their
particular firm in a way that discourages militancy. After all, it is
a positive benefit to an employer if workers say, as a shop steward
in a Leeds factory once told me: &#8216;This is the best firm in the
country.&#8217; There has been an increase in casual employment in some
countries in recent periods of economic crisis. But it is not an
unstoppable trend in capitalism as a whole, and it certainly will not
stop workers organising and rocking the system.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Globalisation and Workers</h4>

<p class="fst">It is often argued workers cannot fight back as they once did
because the globalisation of the world economy allows firms to shut
down operations and re-open somewhere else. Globalisation certainly
means finance houses and speculators can move massive amounts of
money from one country to another at the click of a computer.</p>

<p>There is also a trend for firms in one country to buy into those
in other countries. But it is harder to move production from country
to country than it is to move money. Productive capital is made up of
factories and machinery, mines, docks and offices. These take years
to build and cannot simply be carted away. Sometimes a firm can move
machinery and equipment. But this is usually an arduous process and,
before equipment can be operated elsewhere, the firm has to recruit
and possibly train a sufficiently skilled workforce. In the interim,
not only does investment in the old buildings have to be written off,
there is no return on investment in the machinery.</p>

<p>What is more, few productive processes are ever completely
self-contained. They depend on inputs from outside and links to
distribution networks. So before a firm sets up a car plant it has to
ensure there are supplies of quality steel available, secure sources
of nuts and bolts, a labour force with the right level of training,
reliable power and water supplies, a trustworthy financial system and
a road and rail network capable of shifting finished products. It has
to persuade other firms or governments to provide these things, and
the process of assembling them can take months or years of
bargaining. Multinational companies do not simply throw these assets
away and hope to find them thousands of miles away because labour is
slightly cheaper or governments slightly more co-operative. Such
moves take time and effort and involve writing off costs. Productive
capital simply cannot be as footloose as people often suggest.</p>

<p>The claim that firms find it easy to move production overseas is
widespread in the US. But economist Tim Koechlin reports that less
than 8 per cent of US productive investment goes abroad. Job losses
are mainly the result of firms cutting the number of workers they
employ in existing plants, or closing some plants so as to
concentrate production in those that remain.</p>

<p>In Britain, the pattern is much the same. The manufacturing
workforce has been cut in half over the last 30 years, but total
output has not fallen and each worker is producing twice as much as
30 years ago. In other words, each worker is more important to the
system now than in the past. There are many important jobs that
cannot be moved abroad &#8211; for example, in construction, newspaper
printing, the docks, the civil service, post and telecommunications,
local government, education, refuse disposal, food distribution and
supermarkets. Even in the case of call centres, where some work has
moved to India, employment in the sector in Britain continues to expand.</p>

<p>Of course, firms do shift location and investments do not always
occur in the same places. Restructuring often does involve moving
production to a new area, and sometimes to another country, and this
is likely to increase in the decades ahead. But such decisions incur
costs and are never taken lightly. Firms that are restructuring
usually prefer to act gradually, moving piecemeal from old plant to
new, keeping supply and distribution networks intact and minimising
dislocation. In the process, workers retain the power to stop
production and to fight attempts to make them pay for restructuring.</p>

<p>The most important effects of the movement of money from country
to country are that it increases economic instability and makes
people feel more insecure. Firms often play on this, threatening to
move production abroad when they have little intention to do so, in
the expectation that this will demoralise workers and persuade them
to accept deteriorating conditions. In calling the bosses&#8217; bluff,
workers can begin to discover their capacity to fight for a world
without insecurity.</p>
