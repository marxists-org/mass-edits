<h3>Revolution in the 21st Century</h3>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h1>11: Human Nature and<br/>
the Alternative to Capitalism</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">Opponents of revolutionary change always fall back on one key
argument &#8211; human nature. They say this rules out any alternative to
the competition and greed that characterise capitalism, that any
revolution will simply give rise to new rulers who treat the mass of
people in the same way as the old rulers. Revolutions inevitably
&#8216;devour their own children&#8217;, they say, quoting one of the
moderates of the French Revolution, because of human nature.</p>

<p>These arguments draw on the notion of human beings as &#8216;naked
apes&#8217;, suggesting people have a tendency towards competitiveness
and violence inherited from our primate ancestors. According to one writer:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Hierarchy is an institution among all social animals and
the drive to dominate one&#8217;s fellows an instinct three or four
million years old ... The human drive to acquire possessions is the
simple expression of an animal instinct ... The roots of nationalism
are dug firmly in the social territory of almost every species of our
related primate family ... Our early human ancestors were engaged in
continual bloody combat both with other species and with each other.
[Robert Ardrey, <strong>African Genesis</strong>, London, 1969]</p>

<p class="fst">Supposedly scientific disciplines, first socio-biology and more
recently evolutionary psychology, have been used to give a
sophisticated veneer to such claims. A book coauthored by one of the
world&#8217;s experts on insects, concluded there are genes for
entrepreneurship, aggression, spite, conformity, xenophobia, gender
roles and much more, and warned against conceiving of human nature
&#8216;as relatively unstructured and largely or wholly the product of
external socio-economic forces&#8217;. (Charles J. Lumsden and Edward O.
Wilson, <strong>Genes, Mind and Culture,</strong> Cambridge, Mass. 1981)</p>

<p>However, there is a key feature of the human genetic make-up which
separates us from other creatures. Animals are genetically programmed
in narrow ways that provide them with behaviour appropriate to a
limited range of environments. We are characterised by immense
flexibility in our behaviour that enables us to thrive in any part of
the world. Our genetic speciality is that we are not specialised, not
constrained by a range of instinctive behaviour. One result is that
human beings can display very different forms of behaviour &#8211;
ranging from great care for one another to selfishness and violence.
The behaviour that predominates is not genetically determined.</p>

<p>For about 94 per cent of the time since modern human beings
evolved our ancestors lived by foraging &#8211; what is often called
hunting and gathering &#8211; before the development of agricultural and
settled village life. Evolutionary biologists claim we were
genetically determined during that period to behave as we do in
present day society. But studies of hunter-gatherer societies report
features very different to the stereotypical view of human nature. An
early observer of the hunter-gathering Montagnais of Canada noted in 1834:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The two tyrants who provide hell and torture for many of
our Europeans do not reign in their great forests &#8211; I mean ambition
and avarice ... not one of them has given himself to the devil to
acquire wealth. [Quoted in M. Sahlins, <strong>Stone Age Economics</strong>,
London 1974]</p>

<p class="fst">More recently an anthropologist wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There is no formal leadership, let alone class division,
within these societies. Individual decision making is possible for
both men and women with respect to their daily routines ... Men and
women alike are free to decide how they will spend each day: whether
to go hunting or gathering, and with whom. [E. Friedl, <strong>Women and
Men: the Anthropologist&#8217;s View</strong>, New York 1975]</p>

<p class="fst">Individual members of hunter-gatherer bands enjoy a level of
autonomy infinitely greater than the mass of people in class
societies. But it is not accompanied by selfishness.</p>

<p>The anthropologist Richard Lee, who carried out the most-thorough
studies of one foraging society, the !Kung of South-West Africa,
concluded:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It is the long experience of egalitarian sharing that has
moulded our past. Despite our seeming adaptation to life in
hierarchical societies, and despite the rather dismal track record of
human rights in many parts of the world, there are signs that
humankind retains a deep-rooted sense of egalitarianism, a
deep-rooted commitment to the norm of reciprocity, a deep-rooted...
sense of community. [R. Lee, <em>Reflections on Primitive Communism</em>,
in T. Ingold and others, <strong>Hunters and Gatherers</strong>, vol.&nbsp;I,
New York 1991]</p>

<p class="fst">Surprisingly, the most prominent right-wing economist of the 20th
century, Friedrich von Hayek, shared the same opinion, although he
did not like the fact, writing of dangerous &#8216;innate instincts&#8217;
that led the mass of people to want &#8216;a just distribution, in which
organised power is used to allocate to each what he deserves&#8217;.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Many Human Natures</h4>

<p class="fst">None of this means there is a wonderful, benign human nature that
automatically leads people to behave in positive ways. Rather, human
behaviour is flexible and varies according to the situation in which
people find themselves. The reason cooperation flowered in
hunter-gatherer society was that humans had to cooperate and care for
one another if they were to survive.</p>

<p>Humanity has lived in many different sorts of society since some
of our ancestors began to adopt ways of living other than
hunter-gathering about 10,000 ago &#8211; from light hoe agriculture,
herding and fishing, to heavy plough agriculture, long-distance
trading, handcraft production and finally, industrial production.
There have been societies based on different kinship lineages,
societies run by privileged religious or royal groups, societies
dominated by warring groups of land owners and capitalist societies
based on the exploitation of wage labour by rival owners of the means
of production. Each society has given rise to characteristic forms of
human behaviour that become so engrained in people&#8217;s thinking that
they appear natural. So in the Middle Ages, it was taken for granted
across most of Europe, Asia and Africa that societies were formed of
a fixed hierarchy of estates or castes into which people were born.
Today, it is taken for granted that individuals compete with one
another to improve their social position &#8211; despite the winners
almost always being the children of those already at the top.</p>

<p>The transition from one such form of society &#8211; which we describe
as feudal &#8211; to another, capitalism, involved a transformation in
&#8216;human nature&#8217;. The ways of thinking and acting today are
specific to capitalist society, hammered into us by hundreds of years
of this society.</p>

<p>This is not the end of the matter however; otherwise it would be
difficult to see how we might build a society based on different
values. Capitalism is based on the contradictory combination of what
Marx identified as &#8216;social production and individual appropriation&#8217;.</p>

<p>On the one hand there is a global productive system, drawing
together the labour of billions of people, who work collectively in
factories, mines, docks, warehouses, supermarkets, offices, farms &#8211;
each connected by transport and communications networks to other
units. This involves continual cooperative interaction between
people. In every workplace people cooperate as well as compete. If
they did not, the system could not function. Nurses do not look at
time sheets or pay scales before dealing with a patient. Teachers do
not demand a bonus before helping a child with reading difficulties.
Soldiers often risk their lives for one another. These tendencies are
increased by one of the many contradictions in the system &#8211; that as
processes become more complex, control from above becomes more
difficult. Management can never have anything like full knowledge of
what is happening in a workplace and place ever greater reliance on
elements of altruism and the desire to do a good job. Hence, the
fashion for participatory schemes designed to make workers feel they
have a real interest in their work. Even at the most mundane level,
people are always getting help from others &#8211; whether asking for
directions or requiring aid in an emergency.</p>

<p>On the other hand, all our efforts are framed by the relentless
competition between companies and states that grab the fruit of our
labour. The system breeds both cooperation and selfishness, altruism
and aggression, care for others and hatred. The system distorts even
our best intentions. To help their children, parents must compete for
nursery and school places. Charities fighting poverty must battle
other charities for money. It is these contradictions in &#8216;human
nature&#8217; under capitalism that explain the mixture of hope and
horror in recent history &#8211; the examples of selflessness and
solidarity alongside atrocities and war.</p>

<p>The values of cooperation and mutual caring only really come into
their own when those whose labour keeps the system going are driven
to struggle against it. It is struggle that frees the cooperative
spirit from the corrosive effects of competition. Even in
small-scale, defensive battles people begin to embrace ideas that
challenge the values of capitalism &#8211; notions of unity, solidarity
and collective endeavour. Major battles lead to new ways of
cooperating that point to a different way of running society. The
cooperative spirit can find its highest expression in strike
committees and picket lines, workers&#8217; councils and workers&#8217; militias.</p>

<p>Vast demonstrations produce a sense of solidarity that begins to
dissolve the atomisation and selfishness of daily life. Great strikes
allow people to develop this sense over days, weeks or months. But
revolutions transform life totally. Hence, one of the extraordinary
features of revolutions repeated in almost every account &#8211; crime
declines even as police forces disintegrate.</p>

<p>In his <strong>The Paris Commune of 1871</strong> (London 1937), Frank
Jellinek wrote: &#8216;Public order had never been so little disturbed
... Crimes of violence were few; robbery decreased notably.&#8217; George
Orwell described the mood in revolutionary Barcelona at the end of 1936:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Waiters and shop workers looked you in the eye and
treated you as equals. Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech
had temporarily disappeared ... Above all there was a belief in the
revolution and the future, a feeling of having suddenly emerged into
an era of equality and freedom. Human beings were trying to behave as
human beings and not as cogs in a capitalist machine.</p>

<p class="fst">In the Gdansk shipyard occupation of 1980, Polish film director
Andzrej Wajda observed &#8216;an impression of calm, coolness, festivity,
something lofty and extraordinary&#8217;. By the end of that year, the
workers&#8217; movement extended to every workplace in Poland, leading a
sociologist to note: &#8216;Much of the interpersonal irritation and
aggressiveness has disappeared. People are being nice to one
another.&#8217; A psychologist in Argentina reports how the development
of a movement among the unemployed in 2001, the piqueteros, led to a
rapid fall in psychological ailments.</p>

<p>In each case, struggle led to one element of &#8216;human nature&#8217;
beginning to eclipse another. The social element in production, which
unites people, escaped from the &#8216;individual appropriation&#8217; &#8211;
the exploitation &#8211; which divides them. It is certain we will see a
transformation of human nature in the revolutionary upheavals that
are inevitable this century. What is not certain is whether these
transformations become permanent or remain fleeting memories.</p>
