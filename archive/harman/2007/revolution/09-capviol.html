<h1>9: Capitalism and violence</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">The anti-capitalist columnist George Monbiot has articulated an
argument you often hear. Writing in the <strong>Guardian</strong> in May 2000,
he wrote &#8216;If advanced capitalism is the most violent of all
political systems then violent conflict with that system is bound to
fail.&#8217; Such arguments are usually combined with claims about the
success of non-violent direct action movements in the past, like
those of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi. However, neither
example lives up to the claims made for it.</p>

<p>Martin Luther King&#8217;s movement did use non-violent tactics. But
the aim was not to convert the segregationists of the US South and
the Ku Klux Klan. Rather, it was to persuade the US government to
intervene against the segregationists, using an embodiment of
organised violence, the US federal forces. When this tactic ceased to
work the Student Non-Violent Co-ordinating Committee broke with King
and adopted the slogan of armed self defence.</p>

<p>Gandhi represented one element in a broad liberation movement,
most of which was prepared to use violence if it seemed necessary.
The highest point of struggle, the Quit India Movement of 1942,
included strikes, armed attacks on police stations, the derailing of
trains, bombings and riots. One of the Indian leaders, Bose,
established an army to fight on the Japanese side against the
British. The final action that persuaded the British to abandon the
country was an Indian naval mutiny in Bombay in 1946 that was
denounced by Gandhi.</p>

<p>All states depend on armed bodies prepared to use violence against
those their rulers&#8217; decree as enemies &#8211; external or internal.
Sometimes the level of force is relatively small, as when police
smash up a demonstration or a picket line. But faced with a serious
threat such forces will use horrific violence even when their
opponents insist on a commitment to peaceful methods as Chile in 1973
demonstrated. Any movement that stands for revolutionary social
change but rules out the use of force when necessary condemns itself
to destruction and its supporters to unnecessary suffering.</p>

<p>Monbiot&#8217;s claim that there is no way to beat the violence of
capitalism ignores the system&#8217;s dependence on wider social
processes. The position of any ruling class rests on its economic
power and ideological dominance as well as its monopoly of physical
force. Revolutionary situations arise when mass movements involving
millions of people lead to the near paralysis of the state. They
involve mass strikes, factory occupations, mutinies, the formation of
workers&#8217; and soldiers&#8217; councils, huge demonstrations and deep
splits in the ruling class. Revolution is possible at such points if
the mass movement is prepared to use armed force to disarm those
military and police units still committed to the old order.</p>

<p>Revolutionary ferment invariably has its effect on the rank and
file of the armed forces. After all, they are people from working
class or lower middle class backgrounds and have either been
conscripted or joined because the military seems a secure job. They
can hardly avoid being influenced by the insurgent mood affecting
their brothers, sisters, parents and former school friends. But the
strict discipline imposed by the officers and NCOs prevents them
giving open expression to their feelings. Those that threaten to
disobey orders can expect the harshest punishment &#8211; during normal
times, long sentences in military prisons, during wars or states of
siege, the firing squad. So in Chile in 1973, naval NCOs who showed
sympathy with the mass movement were thrown into prison and tortured.
In Germany in 1917, when sailors organised a peaceful strike, the
officers listened to their complaints, asked them to disperse and
then organised a squad to arrest and execute those they considered
the ring leaders.</p>

<p>Any successful revolution depends on the rank and file of the
armed forces being prepared to use their arms to disarm their
officers and dissolve the most reactionary military units. The key
moment in the establishment of the Paris Commune in 1871 came when a
group of working class women persuaded soldiers moving heavy guns to
hand them over to the people. In Russia in February 1917 three days
spent confronting mass demonstrations left many soldiers sympathetic
to the rising and some of them took the initiative to arrest their
own officers. In Barcelona in July 1936, when the generals initiated
a coup to impose fascism across Spain, it was the resistance of
poorly armed militias in Barcelona set up by anarchist union the CNT
and the Marxist party, the POUM, that persuaded a section of the
army, the Assault Guards, to join the resistance.</p>

<p>In each case, the initiative from workers outside the army was the
key to giving the rank-and-file soldiers the confidence to take a
stand against their reactionary officers. They would only take such a
stand if they felt the workers movement was going to go all the way &#8211;
not merely exert pressure on the army, but join with the soldiers to
break the control of the officers and prevent punishment of the
soldiers. That did not necessitate massive force. One hundred armed
privates can confront one armed officer with minimal violence. But it
does require a clear determination to use force if there is any
resistance. Non-violence is not an option for soldiers intent on a
successful mutiny, for it leaves the officers free to organise
violent action against them.</p>

<p>When the most active sections of the masses and the minority among
the rank-and-file of the armed forces are organised to act decisively
the level of real violence &#8211; of deaths and injuries &#8211; is
invariably small. By contrast, when the advanced sections are
disorganised or pacifist feelings prevail the level of violence from
the other side will be very great.</p>

<p>What is vital is the level of success in drawing the most militant
sections of workers into a revolutionary organisation with wide
influence not only in the workplaces and localities, but also in the
armed forces. Only such an organisation can set out to coordinate the
actions of those in the barracks who secretly sympathise with the
revolutionary goals of the wider movement.</p>
