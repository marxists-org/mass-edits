<h1>7: The Role of Revolutionaries</h1>

<br/>
<p class="fst">Revolutions never break out just because of the efforts of groups
of socialists, however dedicated. They occur, as we saw, when great
social crises create a situation in which &#8216;the lower classes do not
want to live in the old way&#8217; and &#8216;the upper classes&#8217; are
&#8216;cannot carry on in the old way&#8217;. The current stage of
capitalism, globalisation, has led to greater unpredictability and
uncertainty for the ruling classes, and greater suffering for the
oppressed in whole regions of the world &#8211; making it inevitable
there will be great social crises in the century ahead of us. The
dynamic of capitalism ensures that upheavals will take place.</p>

<p>But not every situation of this kind ends in a socialist
revolution, far from it. Most of those we have referred to in the
last century did not. More recently, the uprisings in Ecuador,
Argentina and Bolivia have so far replaced openly neo-liberal
governments with those promising progressive reforms. This is because
the contradictions in people&#8217;s consciousness do not simply
disappear even during periods of upheaval. People have it hammered
into their heads that they can&#8217;t run things. So, even after
overthrowing a government, most people are likely at first to place
their hopes in a new government, apparently less hostile to their demands.</p>

<p>Even as millions of people discuss how to change society, the
influence of ideas and institutions that argue for only limited
reforms persist. While whole groups of workers with past experience
of struggle move beyond notions of reform to see the need to confront
the system, other groups making their first moves towards class
consciousness tend to follow the trade unions and reformist parties
which tell their supporters to hold back from a revolutionary
confrontation. This reformist approach &#8211; sometimes coated in
radical, even revolutionary language &#8211; always finds a mass audience
in the period after a first popular upsurge.</p>

<p>In fact, solutions that avoid confrontation are not possible
during social crises on this scale. But that does not prevent many
people seeing the reformists at first as more practical and less
violent than those pushing for revolution. After the uprising that
overthrew the Tsar in Russia in February 1917, people put their faith
in governments headed first by a war profiteer, Prince Lvov, and then
by a lawyer, Kerensky, committed to maintaining capitalism intact. In
Argentina in 2001&#8211;2 people who threw out four presidents from the
old political establishment, one after the other in less than a
month, eventually came to tolerate two others from a similar
background &#8211; Duhalde and Kirchner.</p>

<p>What seems like a single, spontaneous movement on the day of the
first upsurge, always develops into different currents &#8211; in effect,
three parties, whether they use this name or not; a revolutionary
party, a reactionary party and, attempting to bridge the gap between
them, a reformist party.</p>

<p>There are sincere revolutionaries who oppose the existence of
parties at all arguing that they undermine the spontaneous
self-activity of workers. But any genuine mass movement involves a
wide array of people with differing views on what needs to be done.
Many argue for the line of action they think correct. Someone
suggests a demonstration or strike. Someone else thinks such action
is premature and there should be further negotiations. A third person
wants no action at all. A movement may appear spontaneous to an
outside observer but viewed from the inside it invariably involves
attempts by myriad individuals to lead in different directions.</p>

<p>Parties would come to exist even if the divergences between people
were simply random, but they never are. The divergences are
structured by the pressure of existing society on the protests that
arise &#8211; above all by the assumptions engrained in the people&#8217;s
consciousness that things cannot be fundamentally different to the
past. Conservative currents argue society cannot be changed at all
and reformist currents that it can only be changed in part. These
currents form spontaneously through the impact of existing society,
and are encouraged by the media and by those with careers tied to the
existing political institutions. So when people say there is no need
for parties, they are saying that there is no need for
revolutionaries to get together to oppose these currents.</p>

<p>However, the outcome of a revolutionary situation depends on the
outcome of the battle by these different currents to give direction
to peoples&#8217; bitterness. In conditions of great crisis, where the
reformist option can provide no solutions, the battle increasingly
becomes a straight fight for influence between revolutionaries and
reactionaries. The future comes to depend on whether those who have
abandoned hopes for reform turn to revolution or reaction.</p>

<p>The battle is both one of ideas and a practical struggle. The
ruling class relies for its supremacy on the working class being
fragmented and lacking in confidence. Workers can only overcome such
impediments through the experience of struggling for control in the
workplace and on the streets. The momentum of struggle at such times
can give even the most unpolitical workers a sense that they are part
of a movement that can create a new society. Reformist attempts to
slow the movement then can prove disastrous, breaking the feeling of
strength and allowing fragmentation to return along with the
reactionary ideas of the ruling class.</p>

<p>This was shown tragically in the case of Chile. The attempt of the
ruling class to smash the reforms of the Allende government in
1972&#8211;73 provoked a counter-offensive by workers. But there was a
powerful reformist current in the workers&#8217; movement, centred on the
Socialist and Communist parties and in control of the national union
federation. Its leaders argued the army generals would respect the
constitutional powers of the president and that the most important
thing was not the struggle in the factories but winning elections and
the support of the supposedly more moderate of two pro-capitalist
parities, the Christian Democrats. When workers took to the streets
against an attempted coup in June 1973, fraternising with soldiers, a
minister in the Allende government told them to go home and rely on
the loyalty of the generals to the constitution. This gave the
generals time to re-establish their hold over the rank and file of
the armed forces and to prepare the barbarously successful coup of
September 1973. The generals then murdered the minister.</p>

<p>Revolutions invariably reach a point at which they must either
move forward, or begin to slip back. Going back can mean a return of
the old order in a worse form even than before. The only way to
prevent this is for revolutionaries to be organised to present their
ideas and suggest a different way forward. A revolutionary party is
not necessary to start a revolution, but it is essential to ensure
its victory when the choice is between socialism and barbarism.</p>
