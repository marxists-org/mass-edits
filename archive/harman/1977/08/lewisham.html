<p class="fst">The day began with a large demonstration called by the All Lewisham Campaign Against Racism and Fascism.</p>

<p>It brought together large numbers of trade unionists and socialists, although the leadership included the local bishop.</p>

<p>It assembled at the other end of Lewisham to the Nazis and its leaders accepted a police order to disband it well away from the Nazi assembly point.</p>

<p>But at least two thirds of the marchers saw that the Nazis will never be stopped by peaceful pleading, and side stepped the police lines to walk to the Nazi&#8217;s assembly point in New Cross.</p>

<p>They were joined by thousands of other people who had responded to the Socialist Workers Party&#8217;s call to stop the Nazis.</p>

<p>The Nazis were allowed through police cordons to join the march by showing their Nazi membership cards.</p>

<p>Suddenly hundreds of police and a score of police horses began to charge down the road clearing a path for the Nazi column.</p>

<p>The crowd of anti-fascists exploded. Sticks, smoke bombs, rocks, bottles were thrown over the police heads at the Nazis.</p>

<p>The would-be master race were now huddled onto the opposite pavement into bedraggled groups, hardly a march at all.</p>

<p>Their humiliation was crowned when, in at least two separate points, anti-fascists rushed across the road to break into the Nazi ranks.</p>

<p>Later, as the defeated Nazis dispersed the police turned on the demonstrators.</p>

<p>The Special Patrol Group (SPG) jumped out of their vans, truncheons out, hitting and grabbing at random.</p>

<p>They flung one anti-fascist through a shop window.</p>

<p>The effect was to remind the local black people of the harassment and humiliation they&#8217;ve suffered at the hands of the police in the past.</p>

<p>Several thousand demonstrators had been marching down the road peacefully, chanting &#8220;We stopped the Front&#8221; and &#8220;The workers united will never be defeated&#8221; to applause from groups of local people gathered at the ends of their roads.</p>

<p>They were clearly about to disperse. Police vans tore into this march from behind, breaking it up and then chasing black youngsters, nearly running them down at 40 m.p.h.</p>
