<P CLASS="fst">First Jamil Mahuad in Ecuador in January 2000, then De La Rua in
Argentina in December 2001, and now Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozado in
Bolivia.</P>
<P>When miners armed with sticks of dynamite, clubs and rocks joined
the crowds thronging the centre of the capital, La Paz, on 17 October
they showed the extent to which the movement against corporate
globalisation finds its sharpest practical expression on the streets
of Latin America.</P>
<P>Bolivia is a poor country &ndash; the poorest in the continent
after Nicaragua. Its population is still mainly rural &ndash; a very
different state of affairs to Brazil, Venezuela or Chile, where most
people now live in cities, let alone long-industrialised Argentina.
But its wealth historically came from the mines, and this led to the
emergence of a tight-knit, highly combative working class. In 1952 it
spearheaded one of the world&rsquo;s most spectacular revolutions,
occupying the capital, disarming the armed forces, and bringing to
power a nationalist government that nationalised the mines and
divided the semi-feudal <I>latifundia</I> (large estates) among the
peasantry.</P>
<P>The miners&rsquo; union leaders agreed to power going to middle
class nationalists intent on fostering the growth of an independent
Bolivian bourgeoisie. But the weakness of Bolivian capitalism
compared to its competitors led to dependence on a succession of
military regimes prepared to use extreme repression to break the
workers&rsquo; organisations. Yet at the end of the 1960s, and again
at the beginning of the 1980s, renewed miners&rsquo; struggles shook
up the whole political structure. In 1971 there was even a brief
period of near dual power, while in the early 1980s the military were
forced to give way to a formally democratic regime with a centre-left
government. It was the neoliberal policy accepted by this government,
with privatisation of industry and halving the mining workforce, that
seemed to break working class power for good.</P>
<P>Then in 2000 began a new phase of rebellion &ndash; not among the
miners, but in the Cochabamba region among peasants and workers, who
blocked roads and brought the economy to a halt in protest against
price rises caused by water privatisation.</P>
<P>The president, the former military dictator Banzer, was forced to
rescind the water privatisation. In the elections that followed
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozado, the main bourgeois candidate, only got 1
percent more votes than one of the leaders of the protest, Evo
Morales of the Movement Towards Socialism.</P>
<P>The new government nevertheless felt confident enough to try to
repress the wave of protests that began in mid-September against the
sell-off of natural gas to British and European multinationals. It
seemed it was going ride out the storm until a massacre of
demonstrators in the Al Alto suburb of La Paz caused the miners to
re-emerge as a strategic force, against the background of strikes,
and worker and peasant road blockages that paralysed the country&rsquo;s
economy. As in 1952, the organised working class, although small
numerically, was able to give the lead to the frustrations of the
rest of the exploited and oppressed population.</P>
<P>In a desperate attempt to save the situation, the parties that
brought Sanchez de Lozado to power opted to replace him with his
deputy, the TV presenter turned media millionaire Carlos Mesa. This
seems to have bought some time for the country&rsquo;s ruling class,
with the protesters returning to their home districts and production
restarting. The new president may try to keep control by sprinkling
his speeches with nationalist phrases and ritual criticisms of
neoliberalism while reassuring the US that its interests are not
threatened. This has been the method used by Kirchner, the new
president of Argentina, to try to bury the memory of the uprising
there.</P>
<P>But it is unlikely that Bolivia&rsquo;s workers and peasants will
simply accept that. Meanwhile the reverberation of the Bolivian
events will spread throughout the continent. Already the <B>Economist</B>
is expressing fear of a similar revolt shaking Honduras, long seen by
US imperialism as central to its control over Central America, while
anti-privatisation struggles are worrying the government of
neighbouring Peru. And the Kirchner government in Argentina cannot
for long maintain the pretence of being friends with the social
movement and the IMF at the same time.</P>
<P>Some of US imperialism&rsquo;s strategists have been hoping that
the Lula government in Brazil would help to contain the growing
radicalism across the continent. Lula was still a hero to thousands
of young left wingers at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre in
January, and has since sought to head off his friendship with the IMF
and his acceptance of the planned Free Trade Area of the Americas
through an agreement to work with Chavez in Venezuela and Kirchner in
Argentina to expand the Latin American trade bloc, Mercosur.
Gutierrez, the new president of Ecuador, is following a similarly
timid path, and the State Department must be hoping that expected
left victories in forthcoming elections in El Salvador and Uruguay
will have a similar outcome.</P>
<P>But Lula and Gutierrez are increasingly under fire from workers,
peasants and indigenous peoples. The Bolivian example will deepen
their problems &ndash; and those of their allies in Washington. The
new wave of struggle will grow &ndash; and grow more radical.</P>
<P>Bolivia is a small country, with a population of just 6 million,
but strategically important. That was why Che Guevara chose it 36
years ago as the launching pad for his desperate attempt to break the
isolation of the Cuban Revolution. His tragic mistake was to
underestimate the country&rsquo;s miners and instead place his hopes
on the most remote part of the countryside. Last month the miners
showed the potential he ignored &ndash; the potential for workers
right across the continent to spearhead the struggles of all the
groups who suffer under capitalism and imperialism.</P>
