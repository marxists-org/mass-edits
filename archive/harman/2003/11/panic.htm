<p class="c"><em>Chris Harman argues that Iraqi resistance is shattering US plans to dominate the world</em></p>

<p class="fst">US FORCES have been occupying Baghdad for just eight months. But already the US faces a situation as serious as that which confronted it after the Tet Offensive in Vietnam in 1968.</p>

<p>And the Tet Offensive took place eight years after the US first sent troops to Vietnam, not eight months.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to lose the situation unless there is a rapid and dramatic change of course,&#8221; concluded a CIA report endorsed by Paul Bremer, the head of the US-run occupation, last week.</p>

<p>The report gave a &#8220;bleak assessment that the resistance is broad, strong and getting stronger&#8221;. It totally rejected the official Bush-Blair line that the resistance is made up of supporters of Saddam Hussein or Al Qaida.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There are thousands in the resistance &#8211; not just a core of Ba&#8217;athists. They are in their thousands, and growing every day. Not all those people are actually firing, but they are providing support, shelter and all that.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The report also acknowledged that the US-appointed Iraq governing council has little support among the Iraqi population.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Single attack</h4>

<p class="fst">The report came to light the day the Iraqi resistance killed 17 Italian troops in a single attack. The following day the resistance brought down two Black Hawk helicopters with a single shot.</p>

<p>On the same day Japan announced that it had changed its mind and was not going to send promised troops to back the US-British occupation. And South Korea reduced the number of troops it will send by nearly half.</p>

<p>There was a panic meeting in the White House and a sudden change of policy. Bush is desperate to get some US troops home before he faces re-election next year. So the US government announced it was going to give power to selected Iraqis much earlier than previously planned &#8211; possibly as early as next June.</p>

<p>Some media reports saw this as a sign of an imminent US withdrawal from Iraq. But Bush insisted it was &#8220;inconceivable&#8221; that the US would quit Iraq and Afghanistan: &#8220;We are not pulling out until the job is done. Period.&#8221;</p>

<p>To prove the point, US planes began bombing parts of Baghdad for the first time since April.</p>

<p>Bush&#8217;s administration has made it clear that the new &#8220;Iraqi government&#8221; will not be elected democratically. It will be based on figures chosen from various tribes and ethnic groups.</p>

<p>The model is that of Afghanistan, where the US rules through a puppet president with the backing of regional warlords.</p>

<p>As the <strong>Times</strong> said last week,</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Officials are concerned that a grassroots election held in the current atmosphere of rising antipathy to the US among ordinary Iraqis could produce a result counter to Washington&#8217;s real interests.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Real elections will not be held for at least two years, until US nominees are able, by a combination of brutality and bribery, to get the result that they want.</p>

<p>If the crisis the US faces today is like that it faced in Vietnam in 1968, its response is also similar to that of President Richard Nixon from 1969 onwards.</p>

<p>Nixon promised a &#8220;Vietnamisation&#8221; of the war. This meant attempting to replace some of the US troops on the ground with Vietnamese troops.</p>

<p>And it meant using US military might to blast the country as never before with explosives, fragmentation bombs, napalm and the deadly defoliant Agent Orange.</p>

<p>And when this did not work, Nixon and his Secretary of State, Kissinger, spread the war into Cambodia, killing another million.</p>

<p>The Iraqisation strategy will not work any better than the Vietnamisation strategy did 30 years ago. The <strong>Guardian</strong> reports that even Bremer is &#8220;concerned&#8221; that &#8220;bombing and heavy-handed raids will increase popular support for the insurgency&#8221;.</p>

<p>But Bush has only one way to give the impression of winning, and it depends on increased bombing and attacks on ordinary Iraqis.</p>

<p>American barbarity will grow and so will resistance to it until the US is forced to get out.</p>
