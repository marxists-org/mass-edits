<hr class="infobot" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p>We are witnessing an obvious tendency towards the increasing
bureaucratization of contemporary societies regardless of their social
and political structures. Theorists in the West assure us that the
momentum of bureaucratization is such that we now live under a
managerial system which has, somewhat imperceptibly, come to replace
capitalism. On the other hand, we have the huge, stupendous growth of
bureaucracy in the post-capitalist societies of the Soviet bloc and
especially in the Soviet Union. We are justified in attempting to
elaborate some theory of bureaucracy which would be more comprehensive
and more satisfying than the fashionable and to a large degree
meaningless clich&eacute;: "managerial society". It is not,
however, easy to come to grips with the problem of bureaucracy; in essence this
problem is as old as civilization, although the intensity with which it
has appeared before men's eyes has varied greatly over the epochs.</p>

<p>If I have undertaken to speak about the roots of bureaucracy, it is
because to my mind we have to dig down to find the deepest
causes&ndash;the initial ones&ndash;of bureaucracy, in order to
see how and why this evil of human civilization has grown to such terrifying
proportions. In the problem of bureaucracy, to which the problem of the
State is roughly parallel, is focused much of that relationship between
man and society, between man and man, which it has now become
fashionable to describe as "alienation".</p>

<p>The term itself suggests the rule of the "bureau", of the apparatus,
of something impersonal and hostile, which has assumed life and reigns
over human beings. In common parlance, we also speak about the lifeless
bureaucrats, about the men who form that mechanism. The human beings
that administer the State look as if they were lifeless, as if they
were mere cogs in the machine. In other words, we are confronted here
in the most condensed, in the most intensive form with the reification
of relationships between human beings, with the appearance of life in
mechanisms, in things. This, of course, immediately brings to our mind
the great complex of fetishism: over the whole area of our market
economy man seems to be at the mercy of things, of commodities, even of
currencies. Human and social relationships become objectified, whereas
objects seem to assume the force and power of living elements. The
parallel between man's alienation from the State and the representative
of the State&ndash;the bureaucracy on the one hand,
and&ndash;between
man's alienation from the products of his own economy on the other, is
obviously very close, and the two kinds of alienation are similarly
interrelated.</p>

<p>There is a great difficulty in getting beyond mere appearances to
the very core of the relationship between society and State, between
the apparatus that administers the life of a community and the
community itself. The difficulty consists in this: the appearance is
not only appearance, it is also part of a reality. The fetishism of the
State and of the commodity is, so to say, "built-in" into the very
mechanism in which State and market function. Society is at one and the
same time estranged from the State and also inseparable from the State.
The State is the incubus that oppresses society, it is also society's
protective angel without which it cannot live.</p>

<p>Here again, some of the most hidden and complex aspects of the
relationship between society and State are clearly and strikingly
reflected in our common language. When we say "they", meaning the
bureaucrats who rule us, "they" who impose taxes, "they" who wage wars,
who do all sorts of things which involve the life of all of us, we
express a feeling of impotence, of estrangement from the State; but we
are also conscious that without the State there would be no social
life, no social development, no history. The difficulty in sifting
appearance from reality consists in this: the bureaucracy performs
certain functions which are obviously necessary and indispensable for
the life of society; yet it also performs functions which might
theoretically be described as superfluous.</p>

<p>The contradictory aspects of bureaucracy have, of course, led to two
contradictory and extremely opposed philosophical, historical, and
sociological views on the problem. There are, apart from many
intermediate shadings, traditionally two basic approaches to the
question of bureaucracy and State; the bureaucratic and the anarchist
approach. You may remember that the Webbs liked to divide people into
those who evaluated political problems from the bureaucratic or from
the anarchist point of view. This is, of course, a simplification, but
nevertheless there is something to be said for this division. The
bureaucratic approach has had its great philosophers, its great
prophets, and its celebrated sociologists. Probably the greatest
philosophical apologist of the State was Hegel, just as the greatest
sociological apologist of the State was Max Weber.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that old Prussia was the paradise of the
bureaucracy and it is therefore not a matter of accident that the
greatest apologists for the State and for bureaucracy have come from
Prussia. Both Hegel and Weber, each in a different way and on different
levels of theoretical thinking are, in fact, the metaphysicians of the
Prussian bureaucracy, who generalize from the Prussian bureaucratic
experience and project that experience on to the stage of world
history. It is therefore necessary to keep in mind the basic tenets of
this school of thought. To Hegel the State and bureaucracy were both
the reflection and the reality of the moral idea, that is the
reflection and the reality of supreme reason, the reality of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Weltgeist</span>,
the manifestation of God in history. Max Weber, who is in a
way a descendant, a grandson of Hegel (perhaps a dwarf grandson), puts
the same idea in the typically Prussian catalogue of the virtues of
bureaucracy:</p>

<p>"Precision, speed, unambiguity, knowledge of the files, continuity,
discretion, unity, strict subordination, reduction of friction and of
material and personal cost&ndash;these are raised to the optimum
point in the strictly bureaucratic administration, especially in its
monocratic form . . . bureaucracy also stands under the principle of
<span style="font-style: italic;">sine ira et studio</span>."<a href="#01">[1]</a></p>

<p>Only in Prussia perhaps could these words have been written. Of
course, this catalogue of virtues can very easily be invalidated by a
parallel catalogue of vices. But it is to me all the more surprising
and in a sense disquieting that Max Weber has recently become the
intellectual light of so much western sociology. (Professor Raymond
Aron's gravest reproach in a polemic against myself was that I write
and speak "as if Max Weber never existed".)</p>

<p>I am quite prepared to admit that no one has probably studied the
minutiae of bureaucracy as deeply as Max Weber; true, he catalogued the
various peculiarities of its development, but he failed to understand
its full meaning. We all know the characteristic feature of that old
German so-called historical school which could produce volumes and
volumes on any particular industry, including the bureaucratic
industry, but could rarely see the mainstream of its development.</p>

<p>At the other extreme we have the anarchist view of bureaucracy and
of the State with its most eminent representatives&ndash;Proudhon,
Bakunin, and Kropotkin&ndash;and with the various derivative trends,
liberal, anarcho-liberal of various shadings. Now, this school, when
you look at it closely, represents the intellectual revolt of the old
France of the bourgeoisie, and of the old Russia of the muzhiks,
against their bureaucracies. This school of thought specializes, of
course, in composing catalogues of bureaucratic vices. The state and
the bureaucracy are seen as the permanent usurpers of history. The
State and bureaucracy are seen as the very embodiment of all evil in
human society, the evil which cannot be eradicated otherwise than by
the abolition of the State and the destruction of all bureaucracy. When
Kropotkin wanted to show the depths of the moral deterioration of the
French revolution, he described how Robespierre, Danton, the Jacobins,
and the Hebertists, changed from revolutionaries to statesmen. In his
eyes, what vitiated the revolution was bureaucracy and the State.</p>

<p>In fact each of these approaches contains an element of truth
because in practice the State and bureaucracy have been the Jekyll and
Hyde of human civilization. They have indeed represented the virtues
and the vices of human society and its historical development in a
manner more concentrated, more intense than any other institution.
State and bureaucracy focus in themselves this characteristic duality
of our civilization: every progress achieved so far has been
accomplished by retrogression; every advance that man made has been
bought at the price of regress; every unfolding of human creative
energy has been paid for with the crippling or stunting of some other
creative energy. This duality has been, I think, very striking in the
development of bureaucracy throughout all social and political regimes.</p>

<p>The roots of bureaucracy are indeed as old as our civilization, or
even older, for they are buried on the border between the primitive
communistic tribe and civilized society. It is there that we find the
remotest and yet the very distant ancestry of the massive, elaborate
bureaucratic machines of our age. They show themselves at the moment
when the primitive community divides into the leaders and the led, the
organizers and the organized, into the managers and the managed. When
the tribe or the clan begins to learn that division of labour increases
man's power over nature and his capacity to satisfy his needs, then we
see the first germs of bureaucracy which become also the very earliest
prelude to a class society.</p>

<p>The division of labour begins with the process of production with
which also appears the first hierarchy of functions. It is here that we
have the first glimpse of the gulf that was about to open in the course
of civilization between mental work and manual labour. The organizer of
the first primitive process in cattle breeding might have been the
forbear of the mandarin, of the Egyptian priest, or the modern
capitalist bureaucrat. The primary division between brain and brawn
brought with it the other manifold sub-divisions, between agriculture
and fishing, or trade and craft or sea faring. The division of society
into classes followed in the course of fundamental process of historic
development. In society on the threshold of civilization to that of our
own days, the basic division has been not so much between the
administrator and the worker, as between the owner and the man without
property; and this division absorbed within itself or overshadowed the
former one. Administration has been, in most epochs, subordinated to
the owners of property, to the possessing classes.</p>

<p>One could broadly categorize the various types of relationships
between bureaucracy and basic social classes: the first one might call
the Egyptian-Chinese type; then comes the Roman-Byzantine type with its
derivative of an ecclesiastic hierarchy in the Roman Church; then we
have the Western European capitalist type of bureaucracy; the fourth
would be the post-capitalist type. In the first three types, and
especially in the feudal and the slave-owning society, the
administrator is completely subordinate to the man of property, so much
so that in Athens, in Rome, and in Egypt it is usually from among the
slaves that the bureaucracy is recruited. In Athens the first police
force was recruited from among the slaves, because it was considered
beneath the dignity of the free man to deprive another free man of
freedom. What a sound instinct! Here you have the almost naively
striking expression of the dependence of the bureaucrat on the property
owner: it is the slave who is the bureaucrat because bureaucracy is the
slave of the possessing class.</p>

<p>In the feudal order the bureaucracy is more or less eclipsed because
the administrators either come directly from the feudal class or are
absorbed into that class. Social hierarchy is, so to say, "built-in"
into the feudal order and there is no need for a special hierarchical
machine to manage public affairs and to discipline the propertyless
masses.</p>

<p>Later, much later, bureaucracy acquires a far more respectable
status and its agents become "free" wage earners of the owners of
property. Then it pretends to rise above the possessing classes, and
indeed above all social classes. And in some respects and up to a
point, bureaucracy indeed acquires that supreme status. The great
separation between the state machine and other classes comes, of
course, in capitalism, where the earlier clearly marked hierarchy and
dependence of man on man, so characteristic of feudal society, no
longer exists. "All men are equal"&ndash;the bourgeois fiction of
equality before the law makes it essential that there should function
an apparatus of power, a state machine strictly hierarchically
organized. Like the hierarchy of economic power on the market, so the
bureaucracy, as a political hierarchy, should see to it that society
does not take the appearance of equality at its face value. There grows
a hierarchy of orders, interests, administrative levels, which
perpetuates the fiction of equality and yet enforces inequality.</p>

<p>What characterizes the bureaucracy at this stage? The hierarchical
structure in the first instance; then the seemingly self-sufficient
character of the apparatus of power enclosed within itself. The
tremendous scope, scale, and complexity of our social life make the
management of society more and more difficult, we are told; only
skilled experts who possess the secrets of administration are able to
perform the organizing functions. No, indeed, we have not moved a very
long way from the time when the Egyptian priest guarded the secrets
which gave him power and made society believe that only he, the
divinely inspired, could manage human affairs. Self-important
bureaucracy, with its mystifying lingo which is to a very large extent
a matter of its social prestige, is, after all, not far removed from
the Egyptian priesthood, with its magic secrets. (Incidentally is it
not also very close to the Stalinist bureaucracy with its obsessive
secrecy?)</p>

<p>Many decades before Max Weber, who was himself so impressed by the
esoteric wisdom of bureaucracy, Engels saw things in a more realistic
and objective light:</p>

<p>"The State", he says, "is by no means a power imposed upon society
from the outside. . . . It is rather the product of society at a
certain stage of development. It is an admission that this society has
involved itself in an insoluble contradiction with itself, that it has
become split in irreconcilable contradictions. . . . In order that . .
. classes with conflicting economic interests should not consume
themselves and society in fruitless struggle, a power had become
necessary which seemingly stands above society, a power that has to
keep down the conflict and keep it within bounds of "order". That power
emerging from society but rising above it and becoming more and more
estranged from it is the State."</p>

<p>Even the welfare state, we may add, is, after all, only the power
that emerges from society but rises above it and becomes more and more
estranged from it. Engels goes on to say:</p>

<p>"In possession of public force and power and of the right to
levy taxes, the officials now stand as the organs of society above society"</p>

<p>he describes the process of the emergence of the state from
the primitive community:</p>

<p>"They (the officials) are not content with the free and willing
respect that had been paid to the organs of a tribal community. . . .
Holders of a power estranged from society, they must be placed in a
position of respect by means of special laws which assure them the
enjoyment of a social halo and immunity."<a href="#02">[2]</a></p>

<p>However, there is no use being angry with bureaucracy: its strength
is only a reflection of society's weakness which lies in its division
between the vast majority of manual workers and a small minority which
specializes in brain work. The intellectual pauperism from which no
nation has yet emancipated itself lies at the roots of bureaucracy.
Other fungi have grown over those roots, but the roots themselves have
persisted in capitalism and welfare capitalism and they have still
survived in post-capitalist society.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>I would like to start this second lecture with a stricter
re-definition of the subject of our discussion. I am not interested in
the general history of bureaucracy, nor do I want to give a description
of the varieties and modalities of bureaucratic rule that can be found
in history. The focus of my subject is this: What are the factors that
have historically been responsible for the political power of
bureaucracy? What are the factors that favour the political supremacy
of bureaucracy over society? Why so far has no revolution succeeded in
breaking down and destroying the might of the bureaucracy? On the
morrow of every revolution, regardless of its character and
the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">ancien
r&eacute;gime</span> which preceded it, a State machine rises
like phoenix from the ashes.</p>

<p>In my first lecture I pointed out&ndash;with some
over-emphasis&ndash;the perennial factor working in favour of
bureaucracy, namely, the division of labour between intellectual work
and manual labour, the gulf between the organizers and the organized.
This contradistinction is in fact the prologue to class society; but in
further social development that prologue becomes as if submerged by the
more fundamental division between the slave owner and the slave,
between the serf owner and the serf, between the man of property and
the propertyless.</p>

<p>The real massive ascendancy of bureaucracy as a distinct and
separate social group came only with the development of capitalism, and
it did so for a variety of reasons: economic and political. What
favoured the spread of a modern bureaucracy was market economy, money
economy and the continuous and deepening division of labour of which
capitalism is itself a product. As long as the servant of the state was
a tax farmer, or a feudal lord, or an auxiliary of a feudal lord, the
bureaucrat was not yet a bureaucrat. The tax collector of the
sixteenth, seventeenth or eighteenth centuries was something of an
entrepreneur; or he was a servant of the feudal lord or part of his
retinue. The formation of bureaucracy into a distinct group was made
possible only by the spread and the universalization of a money
economy, in which every state employee was paid his salary in money.</p>

<p>The growth of bureaucracy was further stimulated by the breaking
down of feudal particularisms and the formation of a market on a
national scale. Only on the basis of a national market could national
bureaucracy make its appearance. By themselves these general economic
causes of the growth of bureaucracy explain only how bureaucracy in its
modern form became possible, but they do not yet explain why it has
grown and why in some definite historical circumstances it has acquired
its political importance. To these questions one should seek an answer
not in economic changes but in socio-political structures. We have, for
instance, the striking fact that England, the country of classical
capitalism, was the least bureaucratic of all capitalist countries,
while Germany, until the last quarter of the nineteenth century the
underdeveloped capitalist country, was the most bureaucratic. France,
which held a middle position, held also a middle position with regard
to the strength of bureaucracy in the political life.</p>

<p>If one were to seek certain general rules about the rise and decline
of bureaucratic influence in capitalist society, one would find that
the political power of bureaucracy under capitalism has always been in
inverse proportion to the maturity, the vigour, the capacity for
self-government of the strata constituting a given bourgeois society.
On the other hand, when in highly developed bourgeois societies class
struggles have reached something like a deadlock, when contending
classes have lain as if prostrate after a series of exhausting social
and political struggles, then political leadership has almost
automatically, passed into the hands of a bureaucracy. In such
situations the bureaucracy establishes itself not only as the apparatus
regulating the functioning of the State, but also as the power imposing
its political will on society. The real cradle of modern bureaucracy,
was, of course, the pre-bourgeois absolute monarchy&ndash;the
Tudors in this country, the Bourbons in France, or the Hohenzollerns in
Prussia&ndash;the monarchy which was maintaining the uncertain
equilibrium between a decaying feudalism and a rising capitalism.
Feudalism was already too weak to continue its supremacy, capitalism
was still too weak to establish its domination; a stasis in the class
struggle, as it were, between feudalism and capitalism left the room
for the absolute monarchy to act as the umpire between the two opposed
camps.</p>

<p>The stronger the opposition of feudal and bourgeois interests and
the more paralysing the stalemate between them, the more scope was
there for the bureaucracy of the absolutist monarchy to play the role
of the arbiter. Incidentally, England (and also the United States) was
the least bureaucratic of all capitalist countries, precisely because
very early in history that feudal capitalist antagonism was resolved
through the gradual merger of the feudal and capitalist interests. The
feudal-bourgeois notables, the great aristocratic English families
assumed some of the functions which on the continent were exercised by
bureaucracy. In a sense, the <span style="font-style: italic;">embourgeois&eacute;s</span>
feudal elements
administered the State without becoming a distinct and separate social
group. The United States too was in its history free from that strife
between feudal and capitalist interests, the strife which acted as a
stimulus for the growth of bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Quite a different and peculiar case was Russia, where the great
power of State and bureaucracy resulted from the underdevelopment of
both social strata: neither the feudal element nor the bourgeoisie were
ever strong enough to manage the affairs of the State. It was the State
that, like the demiurge, created social classes, now inducing their
formation and expansion, now impeding and thwarting it. In this way its
bureaucracy became not only an umpire but also the manipulator of all
social classes.</p>

<p>If I were to give a sub-title to my further remarks it would
probably be a very general one: on bureaucracy and revolution. Here I
would like to clear some confusion, and, I fear that in the process I
shall clash with several established historical schools. As this is
anyhow unavoidable, I shall pose the problem in its most provocative
form: Was the English Puritan revolution a bourgeois revolution? Was
the Great French Revolution bourgeois in character? At the head of the
insurgent battalions there were no bankers, merchants, or shipowners.
The sans culottes, the plebs, the urban paupers, the lower-lower middle
classes were in the forefront of the battle. What did they achieve?
Under the leadership of "gentlemen farmers" (in England) and lawyers,
doctors, and journalists (in France), they abolished the absolutist
monarchy and its courtier bureaucracy and swept away feudal
institutions which were hindering the development of bourgeois property
relations. The bourgeoisie had become strong enough and sufficiently
aware of its power to aspire to political self-determination. It no
longer wanted to accept the tutelage and the dictates of the absolutist
monarchy; it wanted to rule society by itself. In the process of the
revolution the bourgeoisie was driven forward by the plebeian
masses&ndash;on the morrow the bourgeoisie attempted by itself to
rule society at large.</p>

<p>The process of the revolution with all its crises, antagonisms, with
the constant shifting of power from the more conservative to the more
radical and even to the Utopian wings of the revolutionary
camp&ndash;all these lead to a new political stalemate between the
classes which came freshly to the fore: the plebeian masses, the sans
culottes, the urban poor are tired and weary; but the victorious, now
dominant class&ndash;the bourgeoisie&ndash;is also internally divided,
fragmented, exhausted after the revolutionary struggle and incapable of
governing society. Hence in the aftermath of bourgeois revolution we
see the rise of a new bureaucracy somewhat different in character: we
see a military dictatorship which outwardly looks almost like the
continuation of the pre-revolutionary absolutist monarchy or an even
worse version of it. The pre-revolutionary regime had its centralized
state machine&ndash;a national bureaucracy. The revolution's first
demand was the decentralization of this machine. Yet this
centralization had not been due to the evil intentions of the ruler,
but reflected the evolution of the economy which required a national
market, and this "national soil", as it were, fed the bourgeois forces
which in their turn produced the revolution. The aftermath of the
revolution brings renewed centralization. This was so under Cromwell;
this occurred under Napoleon. The process of centralization and
national unification and the rise of a new bureaucracy was so striking
that Tocqueville, for example, saw in it nothing more than the
continuation of pre-revolutionary tradition. He argued that what the
French revolution had done was merely to carry further the work of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">ancien r&eacute;gime</span>
and, had the revolution not taken place, this
trend would have gone on all the same. This was the argument of a man
who had his eyes fixed on the political aspect of the development only
and completely ignored its social background and deeper social motives;
he saw the shape but not the texture or the colour of society.</p>

<p>Political centralization after the revolution went on as before, yet
the character of the bureaucracy had completely and thoroughly changed.
Instead of the courtier-bureaucracy of the <span style="font-style: italic;">ancien r&eacute;gime</span>,
France now had the bourgeois bureaucracy recruited from different layers of
society. The bourgeois bureaucracy established under Napoleon survived
the Restoration and in the end found its proper head in the Citizen King.</p>

<p>The next phase in which we see another rise of bureaucracy and a
further promotion of centralistic tendencies of the State occurs again
at a moment of political paralysis of all social classes. In 1848 we
find a situation in which different class interests are again opposed
to each other; this time it is the interest of the established
bourgeoisie and that of the nascent proletariat. To this day nobody has
described this process of mutual exhaustion better than Karl Marx,
especially in the <span style="font-style: italic;">18th
Brumaire</span>. He also demonstrated how the
prostration of all social classes secures the triumph of the
bureaucracy, or rather of its military arm, under Napoleon III. This
situation was characteristic at the time not only of France but also of
Germany, especially of Prussia, where the deadlock was many-sided:
between the feudal and semi-feudal interests of the Junkers, the
bourgeoisie, and the new working class. And in Prussia it resulted in
the rule and dictatorship of Bismark's bureaucracy. (Incidentally, Marx
and Engels described Bismarck's government as a "Bonapartist" regime,
although outwardly there was, of course, very little or nothing of the
Bonaparte in Bismarck.)</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>I am well aware that because of the vastness of the subject I can do
no more than indicate schematically the main points which need further
elaboration. I should perhaps warn you that I am not going to deal with
reformist socialism and bureaucracy. This, important though it is
politically, especially in this country, presents from my viewpoint
very little theoretical interest. To my mind it is part of "Capitalism
and bureaucracy". The bulk of the economy remains capitalist whether 15
per cent or even 25 per cent of industry is nationalized, and here
quantity decides also the quality. The whole background of social life
is capitalist and an ordinary capitalist bureaucratic spirit permeates
all industries including the nationalized ones. We hear a lot of
grumbling about "bureaucracy on the railways" or in the coal mines.
During the recent strike we were presented on television some
railwaymen who told us "Things are not as they used to be": before the
nationalization of the railways they could maintain a more personal
relationship between themselves and their employers, while now the
industry has become so anonymous that there is no personal link between
the working-men and this vast nation-wide enterprise. This "personal
link" was, of course, a figment of the worker's imagination. What sort
of a personal relationship was there between the footplateman and the
boss of one or another of the five huge railway companies? But
politically it was important that this railwayman really believed that
in the Southern or Midland or Western Railway he was more than a mere
cog. Now he felt "alienated from that vast entity into which he had to
fit, for which he had to work. And this "alienation", as the word goes,
is a problem common to all sorts of bureaucratic establishments, no
matter what is their broader social framework, and I would be the last
to deny that there are certain common features between bureaucracy in a
capitalist and in a post-capitalist system.</p>

<p>Now I should like to touch upon those special problems of
bureaucracy which arise in a fully nationalized industry after a
socialist revolution, under a regime which, at least in its beginnings,
is in every sense a proletarian dictatorship. Clearly this problem
affects one-third of the world, so it is weighty enough; and I am
pretty sure that many of you will still see it acquire validity at
least over two-thirds of the world.</p>

<p>One of the observations that occurred to me as I looked through some
of the classical Marxist writings on bureaucracy was how relatively
optimistically&ndash;one might say, lightmindedly&ndash;Marxists
approached it. To give you one illustration: Karl Kautsky once asked
himself the question whether a socialist society would be threatened
with all the evils of bureaucracy. You may remember, if you have read
<span style="font-style: italic;">The Foundations of
Christianity</span>, that Kautsky discusses the process by
which the Christian Church was transformed from a faith of the
oppressed into a great imperial bureaucratic machine. This
transformation was possible against the background of a society which
lived on slave labour. The slaves of antiquity, devoid of any active
class consciousness, were liable to become slaves of bureaucracy. But
the modern working class, mature enough to overthrow capitalism,
maintained Kautsky, will not allow a bureaucracy to rise on its back.
This was not just an individual judgment of Kautsky, who for over two
decades between Engels' death and the outbreak of the first world war
was the most authoritative spokesman of Marxism and was considered a
real successor to Marx and Engels. Engels himself in various of his
works, especially in <span style="font-style: italic;">Anti-D&uuml;hring</span>,
committed himself to a view
which almost ruled out in advance the existence of bureaucracy under
socialism: "The proletariat seizes the State power and transforms the
means of production in the first instance into State property. But in
doing this it puts an end to itself as proletariat, it puts an end to
all class antagonism. . . ."<a href="#03">[3]</a>
Former societies needed the State as an
organization of the exploiting class, as a means of holding down the
class that was exploited&ndash;slaves, serfs, or wage labourers. In
socialism the State, when it becomes really representative of society
as a whole, makes itself superfluous. And with the full development of
modern productive forces, with the abundance and superabundance of
goods, there will be no need to keep men and labour in subjection.</p>

<p>I think it was Trotsky who used a very plain but very telling
metaphor: the policeman can use his baton either for regulating traffic
or for dispersing a demonstration of strikers or unemployed. In this
one sentence is summed up the classical distinction between
administration of things and administration of men. If you assume a
society in which there is no class supremacy, the bureaucracy's role is
reduced to the administration of things, of the objective social and
productive process. We are not concerned with the elimination of all
administrative functions&ndash;this would be absurd in an
industrially developing society&ndash;but we are concerned with reducing the
policeman's baton to its proper role, that of disentangling traffic jams.</p>

<p>When Marx and Engels analysed the experience of the Commune of
Paris, they were as if half-aware of the bureaucratic threat that could
arise in the future and they were at great pains to underline the
measures that the Commune had taken in order to guarantee a socialist
revolution against the recrudescence of a bureaucratic power. The
Commune, they stressed, had taken a number of precautions which should
serve as a pattern and a model for future socialist transformations:
the Commune was elected in a general election and established an
elected civil service, every member of which could be deposed at any
time at the demand of the electorate. The Commune abolished the
standing army and replaced it by the people at arms; it also
established the principle that no civil servant could earn more than
the ordinary worker. This should have abolished all privileges of a
bureaucratic class or group. The Commune, in other words, set the
example of a State which was to begin to wither away as soon as it was
established. It was no matter of chance that only a few weeks before
the October revolution Lenin made a special effort to restore this, by
then almost forgotten, part of Marxist teaching about State, socialism,
and bureaucracy. He expressed his idea of the state in that famous
aphorism: under socialism or even in a proletarian dictatorship the
administration should become so simplified that every cook should be
able to manage state affairs.</p>

<p>In the light of all the painful experience of the last decades it is
all too easy to see how very greatly the representatives of classical
Marxism had indeed underrated the problem of bureaucracy. There were, I
think, two reasons why this was so. The original founders of the
Marxist school never really attempted to portray in advance the society
which would emerge after a socialist revolution. They analysed
revolution, so to say, in the abstract, in a way in which Marx in <span style="font-style: italic;">Das
Kapital</span> analysed not any specific capitalist system, but
capitalism in the abstract, capitalism <span style="font-style: italic;">per
se</span>; they also thought of socialist or
post-capitalist society in the abstract. If one considers that they
carried their analysis so many decades before the actual attempt, their
method was scientifically justified. The other reason is, so to say,
psychological. They could not help viewing the future revolution on the
pattern of the greatest revolutionary experience in their own life,
that of 1848. They saw it as a chain process of European revolutions,
as 1848 was, spreading at least over Europe more or less
simultaneously. (Here was that germ of the idea of permanent revolution
which was in this respect not the original creation of Trotsky; it was
indeed very deeply embedded in the thought of classical Marxism.) An
all-European socialist revolution would have been relatively secure
immediately after its victory. With very little social tension there
would be hardly any civil strife, and without wars of intervention
there would have been no need for the re-creation of standing armies
which are an important factor of bureaucratization. They also assumed
that at least in the highly industrialized societies of western Europe,
the very considerable proportion of the working class would provide a
strong mass support for the revolutionary government. They also trusted
that once the majority of the European working class would be won for
the revolution, it would, as it were, remain faithful and loyal to the
revolution. This, together with the existing democratic tradition would
form the strongest guarantee against any revival or formation of a new
bureaucratic machine.</p>

<p>When we are tempted to reproach the founders of the Marxist school
with underrating the dangers of bureaucracy in post-revolutionary
society, we must bear in mind the fact that they took the abundance of
goods as the first condition, a pre-condition and <span style="font-style: italic;">raison d'etre</span> of a
socialist revolution. "The possibility of securing for every member of
society, through social production, an existence which is not only
fully sufficient from a material standpoint . . . but also guarantees
to them the completely unrestricted development and exercise of their
physical and mental faculties&ndash;this possibility now exists . . .
it does exist", stated Engels emphatically in <span style="font-style: italic;">Anti-D&uuml;hring</span>
nearly 90 years ago.<a href="#04">[4]</a> It is only in the
middle of this century that we are
faced with some attempts at socialist revolution in countries where a
desperately insufficient production makes any decent material existence
quite impossible.</p>

<p>There was undoubtedly in Marxism an ambivalent attitude towards the
State. On one hand&ndash;and this Marxism had in common with
anarchism&ndash;a conviction based on a deeply realistic historical
analysis that all revolutions are frustrated as long as they do not do
away with the State; on the other, the conviction that the socialist
revolution has need of a State for its purpose, to smash, to break the
old capitalist system and create its own state machine that would
exercise the proletarian dictatorship. But that machine, for the first
time in history, would represent the interests not of a privileged
minority but of a mass of toilers, the real producers of society's
wealth. "The first act in which the State really comes forward as the
representative of society as a whole"&ndash;the taking possession
of the means of production&ndash;"is at the same time its last
independent act as a State."<a href="#05">[5]</a> From then on
the interference of the State in
social relations becomes superfluous. The government of persons is
replaced by the administration of things. The political function of the
State disappears; what remains is the direction of the process of
production. The State will not be abolished overnight, as the
anarchists imagine; it will slowly "wither away".</p>

<p>The reality of the Russian revolution was in every single respect a
negation of the assumptions made by classical Marxism. It was certainly
not the revolution in the abstract&ndash;it was real enough! It did
not follow the 1848 pattern, it was not an all-European upheaval; it
remained isolated in one country. It occurred in a nation where the
proletariat was a tiny minority and even that minority disintegrated as
a class in the process of world war, revolution, and civil war. It was
also a country extremely backward, poverty stricken, where the problem
immediately facing the revolutionary government was not to build
socialism, but to create the first pre-conditions for any modern
civilized life. All this resulted in at least two political
developments which invariably led to the recrudescence of bureaucracy.</p>

<p>I have described how the political supremacy of bureaucracy always
followed a stalemate in the class struggle, an exhaustion of all social
classes in the process of political and social struggles. Now, mutatis
mutandis, after the Russian revolution we see the same situation again.
In the early 1920s all classes of Russian society, workers, peasants,
bourgeoisie, landlords, aristocracy are either destroyed or completely
exhausted politically, morally, intellectually. After all the trials of
a decade filled with world war, revolution, civil wars and industrial
devastation no social class is capable of asserting itself. What is
left is only the machine of the Bolshevik party which establishes its
bureaucratic supremacy over society as a whole. However, <span style="font-style: italic;">cela change et
ce n'est plus la m&ecirc;me chose</span>: society as a whole
has undergone a
fundamental change. The old cleavage between the men of property and
the propertyless masses gives place to another division, different in
character but no less noxious and corrosive: the division between the
rulers and the ruled. Moreover, after the revolution it acquires a far
greater force than it had before when it was as if submerged by class
distinction and class discord. What again comes to the fore is the
perennial, the oldest split between the organizers and the organized.
The prelude to class society appears now as the epilogue. Far from
"withering away" the post-revolutionary state gathers into its hands
such power as it has never had before. For the first time in history
bureaucracy seems omnipotent and omni-present. If under the capitalist
system we saw that the power of bureaucracy always found a
counterweight in the power of the propertied classes, here we see no
such restrictions and no such limitations. The bureaucracy is the
manager of the totality of the nation's resources; it appears more than
ever before independent, separated, indeed set high above society.
Indeed far from withering away the State reaches its apotheosis which
takes the form of an almost permanent orgy of bureaucratic violence
over all classes of society.</p>

<p>Let us now go back for a moment to the Marxist analysis of the
revolution in the abstract and see where and in what way the picture of
post-revolutionary Russia contradicts this analysis. Had there been a
European revolution in which proletarian majorities would have won
swiftly and decisively and spared their nations all the political and
social turmoil and slaughter of wars and civil strife, then very
probably we would not have seen that fear-inspiring apotheosis of the
Russian State. Nevertheless the problem would still have existed to a
degree which the classical Marxism did not envisage. To put it in a
nutshell: it seems that the thinkers and theoreticians of the
nineteenth century tended to telescope certain stages of future
development from capitalism to socialism. What classical Marxism
"telescoped" was the revolution-and-socialism as it were, whereas
between the revolution and socialism there was bound to lie a terribly
long and complicated period of transition. Even under the best of
circumstances that period would have been characterized by an
inevitable tension between the bureaucrat and the worker. <span style="font-style: italic;">Some</span>
prognosis of that tension can be found in Marxism, however. In their
famous <span style="font-style: italic;">Critique of the
Gotha Programme</span> Marx and Engels speak about two
phases of communism, the lower and the higher one. In the lower one
there still prevails the "narrow horizon of bourgeois rights" with its
inequality and its wide differentials in individual incomes. Obviously,
if in socialism society, according to Marx, still needs to secure the
full development of its productive forces until a real economy of
wealth and abundance is created, then it has to reward skill and offer
incentives. The bureaucrat is in a sense the skilled worker and there
is no doubt that he will place himself on the privileged side of the scale.</p>

<p>The division between the organizers and the organized acquires more
and not less importance, precisely because the means of production
having passed from private to public ownership, the responsibility for
the running of the national economy rests now with the organizers. The
new society has not developed on its own foundations, but is emerging
from capitalism and still bears all the birthmarks of capitalism. It is
not yet ripe economically, morally, and intellectually, to reward
everyone according to his needs and as long as everyone has to be paid
according to his work, the bureaucracy will remain the privileged
group. No matter what the pseudo-Marxist terminology of present Russian
leaders, Russian society today is still far from socialist&ndash;it
has only made the very first step on the road of transition from capitalism
towards socialism.</p>

<p>The tension between the bureaucrat and the worker is rooted in the
cleavage between brain work and manual labour. It simply is not true
that today's Russian State can be run by any cook&ndash; (although
all sorts of cooks try to do it.) In practice it proved impossible to
establish and maintain the principle proclaimed by the Commune of Paris
which served Marx as the guarantee against the rise of bureaucracy, the
principle extolled again by Lenin on the eve of October, according to
which the functionary should not earn more than the ordinary worker's
wage. This principle implied a truly egalitarian society&ndash;and
here is part of an important contradiction in the thought of Marx and his
disciples. Evidently, the argument that no civil servant, no matter how
high his function, must not earn more than an ordinary worker, cannot
be reconciled with the other argument that in the lower phase of
socialism which still bears the stamp of "bourgeois rights" it would be
utopian to expect "equality of distribution". In the post-revolutionary
Russian state with its poverty and its inadequate development of
productive forces the scramble for rewards was bound to be fierce and
ferocious, and because the abolition of capitalism was inspired by a
longing for egalitarianism, the inequality was even more revolting and
shocking. It was also inequality on an abysmally low level of
existence, or rather inequality below subsistence level.</p>

<p>Part of the Marxist theory of the withering away of the State was
based upon a certain balance between its centralistic organization and
the universal element of decentralization. The socialist state was to
have been a state of elected communes, local municipal councils, local
governments and self-governments, yet they were all to form a unified
organism which was necessary for a rational nationalized mode of
production. This concept also presupposed a highly developed society
which Russia at the beginning of the century was not.</p>

<p>In the development of post-capitalist society the tension between
the worker and bureaucrat may yet prove to have some essentially
creative elements. The worker and the bureaucrat are equally necessary
for the transition towards socialism. As long as the working masses are
still in that stage of intellectual pauperism left over from the
centuries of oppression and illiteracy, the management of the processes
of production must fall to the civil servant. On the other hand, in a
truly post-capitalist society the basic social class are the workers
and socialism is the workers' and not the bureaucrats' business. The
dynamic balance between the official and the worker will find its
counterpart in the authority of the state and in the control of the
masses over the state. This will also assure the necessary equilibrium
between the principle of centralization and that of decentralization.
What we have seen in Russia has been an utter disequilibrium. As a
result of objective historic circumstances and subjective interests,
the balance swung heavily, decisively, absolutely to the side of
bureaucracy. What we have seen in Hungary and Poland in 1956 was a
reaction against this&ndash;Stalinist&ndash;state of affairs
with an extreme swinging of the pendulum in the other direction and the
workers' passionate, violent, unreasoning revolt against bureaucratic
despotism, a revolt no doubt justified by all their experiences and
grievances, but a revolt which in its consequences led again to a grave
and dangerous imbalance.</p>

<p>How then do I see the prospects and how do I see the further
development of that tension between the worker and the bureaucrat?</p>

<p>I have indicated earlier all the faults of the historical
perspective in the classical Marxist view of bureaucracy. Yet, I think
that basically and fundamentally this view helps to cope with the
problem of bureaucracy far better than any other that I have come across.</p>

<p>The question which we have to answer is this: has the bureaucracy,
whose apotheosis after the revolution I have described, constituted
itself into a new class? Can it perpetuate itself as a privileged
minority? Does it perpetuate social inequality? I would like first of
all to draw your attention to one very obvious and important but often
forgotten fact: all the inequality that exists in today's Russia
between the worker and the bureaucrat is an inequality of consumption.
This is undoubtedly very important, irritating, and painful; yet with
all the privileges which the bureaucrat defends brutally and stubbornly
he lacks the essential privilege of owning the means of production.
Officialdom still dominates society and lords over it, yet it lacks the
cohesion and unity which would make of it a separate class in the
Marxist sense of the word. The bureaucrats enjoy power and some measure
of prosperity, yet they cannot bequeath their prosperity and wealth to
their children. They cannot accumulate capital, invest it for the
benefit of their descendants: they cannot perpetuate themselves or
their kith and kin.</p>

<p>It is true that Soviet bureaucracy dominates society&ndash;economically, politically, and
culturally&ndash;more obviously and to a greater extent than does any modern possessing
class. Yet it is also more vulnerable. Not only can it not perpetuate
itself, but it has been unable even to secure for itself the continuity
of its own position, the continuity of management. Under Stalin one
leading group of bureaucrats after another was beheaded, one leading
group of managers of industry after another was purged. Then came
Khrushchev who dispersed the most powerful centre of that bureaucracy:
all the economic ministries in the capital were scattered over wide and
far flung Russia. Until this day, the Soviet bureaucracy has not
managed to acquire that social, economic, and psychological identity of
its own which would allow us to describe it as a new class. It has been
something like a huge amoeba covering post-revolutionary society with
itself. It is an amoeba because it lacks a social backbone of its own,
because it is not a formed entity, not a historic force that comes on
the scene in the way in which, say, the old bourgeoisie came forth
after the French revolution.</p>

<p>Soviet bureaucracy is also hamstrung by a deep inherent
contradiction: it rules as a result of the abolition of property in
industry and finance, as a result of workers' victory over the <span style="font-style: italic;">ancien
r&eacute;gime</span>; and it has to pay homage to that
victory; it has to
acknowledge ever anew that it manages industry and finance on behalf of
the nation, on behalf of the workers. Privileged as they are, the
Soviet managers have to be on their guard: as more and more workers
receive more and more education, the moment may easily come when the
managers' skill, honesty, and competence may come under close scrutiny.
They thrive on the apathy of the workers who so far have allowed them
to run the state on their behalf. But this is a precarious position, an
incomparably less stable foundation than that sanctified by tradition,
property, and law. The conflict between the liberating origin of
bureaucracy's power and the use it makes of that power generates
constant tension between "us" the workers and "them" the managerial and
political hierarchy.</p>

<p>There is also another reason for the lack of stability and cohesion
in the managerial group no matter how privileged it has become. Over
the last decades the Soviet bureaucracy has all the time been in a
process of stupendous expansion. Millions of people from the working
class and to a lesser extent from the peasantry were recruited into its
ranks. This continuous expansion militates against the crystallization
of the bureaucracy not only into a class but even into a cohesive
social group. I know, of course, that once a man from the lower classes
is made to share in the privileges of the hierarchy, he himself becomes
a bureaucrat. This may be so in individual cases and in abstract
theory, but on the whole "betrayal of one's class" does not work so
very simply. When the son of a miner or a worker becomes an engineer or
an administrator of a factory he does not on the next day become
completely insensitive to what goes on in his former environment, in
the working class. All surveys show convincingly that in no other
country is there such a rapid movement from manual to non-manual and to
what the Americans like to call "elite strata" as there is in the
Soviet Union.</p>

<p>We must also realize that the privileges of the great majority of
the bureaucracy are very, very paltry. The Russian administrator has
the standard of living of our lower middle classes. Even the luxuries
of the small minority high on the top of the pyramid are not especially
enviable, particularly if one considers the risks&ndash;and we all
know now how terrible these were under Stalin.</p>

<p>Of course, even small privileges contribute to the tension between
the worker and the bureaucrat, but we should not mistake that tension
for a class antagonism, in spite of some similarities which on closer
examination would prove only very superficial. What we observe here is
rather the hostility between members of the same class, between, say, a
skilled miner and an unskilled one, between the engine driver and a
less expert railwayman. This hostility and this tension contain in
themselves a tremendous political antagonism, but one that cannot be
resolved by any upheaval in society. It can be resolved only by the
growth of the national wealth in the first instance, a growth which
would make it possible to supply the broadest masses of the population
with the minimum needs, and more than that. It can be resolved by the
spread and improvement in education, because it is the material and
intellectual wealth of society that leads to the softening of the
age-old division&ndash;the renewed and sharpened
division&ndash;between
the organizers and the organized. When the organized is no longer the
dumb and dull and helpless muzhik, when the cook is no longer the old
scullion, then indeed the gulf between the bureaucrat and the worker
can disappear. What will remain will be the division of functions not
of social status.</p>

<p>The old Marxist prospect of "withering away" of the state may seem
to us odd. But let us not play with old formulas which were part of an
idiom to which we are not accustomed. What Marx really meant was that
the state should divest itself of its oppressive political functions.
And I think this will become possible only in a society based on
nationalized means of production, free from slumps and booms, free from
speculations and speculators, free from the uncontrollable forces of
the whimsical market of private economy; in a society in which all the
miracles of science and technology are turned to peaceful and
productive uses; in which automation in industry is not hampered by
fear of investment on the one side and fear of redundancy on the other;
in which working hours are short and leisure civilized (and completely
unlike our stultifying commercialized mass entertainment!);
and&ndash;last but not least&ndash;in a society free from
cults, dogmatism and orthodoxies&ndash;in such a society the antagonism
between brainwork and manual labour will really wither away, as will
the division between the organizers and the organized. Then, and only
then, it will be seen that if bureaucracy was a faint prelude to class
society, bureaucracy will mark the fierce ferocious epilogue to class
society&ndash;no more than an epilogue.</p>
