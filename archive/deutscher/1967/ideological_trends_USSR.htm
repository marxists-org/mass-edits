<p>A SURVEY of current Soviet trends in party and ideology may take as its
starting point the political crisis which developed in the Soviet Union
in the second half of the year 1964 and led to Khrushchev's downfall.
The crisis was a rather complex affair with many issues, trends, and
attitudes involved, and it did not lead to any clear-cut solutions. The
situation which has developed since Khrushchev's downfall has remained
as ambiguous as that which had preceded it. By disassociating itself
from its leader, the Soviet ruling group acknowledged tacitly the
fiasco of the Khrushchevite policies and ideological conceptions; but
they refused to make the acknowledgment explicit or to draw
conclusions. Their reticence was not accidental. It reflected the
profound embarrassment with which Khrushchev's successors viewed the
discomfiture of his policies. Khrushchevism, to put it in a nutshell,
had proved itself unable to cope with the many issues posed in the
process of de-Stalinization. To have posed those issues was
Khrushchev's historic merit: to leave them unsettled, unclarified and,
in many cases, even aggravated was his sad destiny. The legacy of the
Stalin era defeated him, and it still over-shadows the Soviet scene
today.</p>

<p>It is now very nearly a commonplace that Stalinism was the product of a
post-revolutionary, isolated, underdeveloped, largely pre-industrial
society engaged in "primitive socialist accumulation", that is, in a
process of rapid industrialization and modernization carried out under
the aegis of the state, on the basis of public ownership of the means
of production. As a system of government and an ideology, Stalinism
represented both the backwardness of its national environment and the
progressive transformation of that environment. Hence, the duality in
the character of Stalinism and its Janus-like appearance. Hence, its
crude violence and primitive, isolationist, ideological outlook on the
one hand, and on the other, its historic &eacute;lan and
determination in replacing Russia's archaic mode of production and way of life by a
modern planned economy and extensive mass education. Admittedly, the
whole phenomenon of Stalinism cannot be explained by these factors
alone, but they do account for its most essential features. Stalinism
was thus a phenomenon of social transition and not (as its adherents
and also most western anti-Communist Sovietologists once maintained)
the quintessence or the final shape of the post-capitalist or socialist
society. The very success which Stalinism attained in changing and
modernizing the social structure of the USSR turned it into an
anachronism and made de-Stalinization a historic necessity.
Khrushchevism, though it proclaimed this necessity, was unable to act
as its effective agent.</p>

<p>To take the economic problem first, the Stalinist method of economic
planning, with its bureaucratic rigidity and over-centralization, dated
back to the early phases of industrialization, which were characterized
by an over-all scarcity of productive resources, skilled labour,
technological know-how, and educational facilities, not to speak of
consumer goods. As these scarcities were being gradually overcome and
as Soviet society entered upon a more advanced stage of economic
expansion and educational progress, Stalinism lost its relative <span style="font-style: italic;">raison
d'etre</span>. It was a relic of the past even in the early fifties, and it
became a formidable obstacle to further advance.</p>

<p>The Khrushchev period brought important and positive changes, a radical
reduction of coercion in economic as well as political life, easier
labour relations, and a more rational outlook in the management of
industry. It failed, however, to rationalize the system of planning as
a whole. What it produced in this field was a purely administrative
de-centralization of industrial management. Khrushchev disbanded the
central ministries that had exercised absolute rule from Moscow over
all branches of the economy. This was his panacea, but it did not work.
By 1964 it had become obvious that the new administrative regime had
resulted in a slowing down of industrial expansion and in a lower rate
of growth of the national income. As these setbacks coincided with a
whole series of bad harvests and a slump in agricultural output, the
improvement in the popular standard of living also came to a halt.
Thus, just as Stalinist bureaucratic rigidity and overcentralization
had proved obsolete in the early fifties, so the Khrushchevite
patchwork of decentralizing reforms lagged behind the needs of the
early sixties.</p>

<p>However, despite this slowing down&ndash;this should not be
forgotten&ndash;the expansion and transformation of the social
structure proceeded on a vast scale&ndash;and this called for reforms
far more radical and comprehensive than anything Khrushchev and his
colleagues envisaged. In the fourteen years since Stalin's death, the
urban population of the USSR has nearly doubled. It has grown by about
fifty million people, mostly rural immigrants who have been absorbed by
industry. This gives us a measure of the momentum of the
social-economic advance and of the demands it put on the leadership of
party and state. The mere overhaul of the administrative mechanism
could do no justice to those demands. The Khrushchevite
decentralization was in fact a narrow, one-sided, bureaucratic reaction
to Stalin's over-centralization. Its effects were probably beneficial
in some cases but harmful in others, and on balance inadequate. What
Khrushchev's successors have since been trying to do is to substitute
economic decentralization for the purely administrative one. This is
the meaning of the latest industrial reform with its emphasis on the
autonomy and profitability of each industrial concern. Incidentally,
the novelty of this reform is far less startling than it appears to
most western observers. And, although it too may have its beneficial
effects and stimulate productivity temporarily, it is not likely to
alter the bureaucratic character of economic management.</p>

<p>The issue of centralized versus decentralized management is, in my
view, only part of the problem of the rationalization of the Soviet
economy, and not its most essential part. The dilemma between
centralization and decentralization is inherent in any planned economy.
It cannot be resolved dogmatically or one-sidedly, and it cannot be
conjured out of existence. The dialectics of planning consists
precisely in this&ndash;that the planner must constantly search for
a balance between the opposites and for their unity, as he must also
search for an equilibrium between the general social needs and the
profitability of particular concerns, between supply and demand, and
between production and consumption. There can be no single prescription
for achieving the equilibrium. The scales may and, indeed, must tilt
one way and the other, and it is the planner's task to control the
oscillations and correct them.</p>

<p>If in the Stalin era the equilibrium was upset by overcentralization,
in recent years, Soviet (and Yugoslav and East European) economists,
reacting against the past, have undoubtedly over-emphasized, in varying
degrees, the principle of decentralization. Their almost exclusive
concentration on the autonomy and profitability of each industrial unit
may swing the pendulum much too far in that direction, at the expense
of the social interests and of the coherence of planning. Some reaction
against this trend is already making itself felt. Nevertheless, this is
not, in my view, the main issue. It is at least premature to see in
this trend a revival of a truly market-oriented economy or any tendency
towards the restoration of capitalism. The Soviet economy was
incomparably more market- and profit-oriented during the NEP period of
the 1920's than it is likely to become, if and when the present reform
is completed. But there was a far cry from NEP to a restoration of
capitalism. Not even Libermanism spells economic liberalism.</p>

<p>The crucial issue posed by the failure of Khrushchevism is neither
administrative nor economic in character but socio-political. The main
cause of the economic disarray revealed in the last years of
Khrushchev's government lay in a crisis of morale, in the persistent
discord between rulers and ruled, in the
"we"-and-"they&rdquo;-conflict, that is, in the feeling of workers and
intellectuals that "they", the bureaucrats, "do what they like anyhow",
regardless of "our" needs, demands and wishes. Bureaucratic
arbitrariness, though it is less severe than it was in Stalin's days,
prevents the mass of producers and administrators from identifying
themselves with the national interest. That is why purely
administrative or economic remedies cannot cope even with the economic
and administrative difficulties; and neither Khrushchev nor his
successors have been able or willing to deal with the moral-political
aspects of the situation. It was because of this that Khrushchevism
suffered defeat after defeat, nationally and internationally, and that
it ran into a deadly impasse.</p>

<p>Nationally, Khrushchevism was unable to fill the political and
ideological void left by Stalinism. Having analysed this question
elsewhere,<a href="#f1">[1]</a> I shall say here only, that Khrushchev and his
colleagues, the present Soviet leaders, have dealt with the legacy of
the Stalin era in a manner which could only produce confusion and
frustration. Brought up in the Stalinist school of thought, and ever
mindful of their own stake in Stalinism, they merely sought to cover up
the void by means of bureaucratic manipulations. They conducted even
de-Stalinization in a Stalinist manner. Imbued with the characteristic
Stalinist belief in the omnipotence of the trick, a belief which has
with them the force of an ineradicable superstition, Khrushchev and his
colleagues in the end turned de-Stalinization itself into a trick, into
a huge and elaborate essay in deception and make-believe. They
denounced Stalin's hypocrisy but sought to protect the hierarchical
structure on which it had rested. They exposed his crimes and did what
they could to conceal their own participation in them. They discredited
the "cult of the personality" but clung to the orthodoxy the cult had
epitomized. They cried out against Stalin's prodigious despotism but
were anxious to save most of his canons and dogmas. They freed the
Soviet people from his massive and ubiquitous terror but tried to keep
the body-politic in the shape it had taken on under the press of that
terror. They sought to preserve the monolith and to keep Soviet society
in that amorphous and atomized condition in which people cannot think
for themselves, express themselves, arrive at nonconformist opinions,
and voice them.</p>

<p>Yet, the huge trick with all the evasions, subterfuges, and
contradictions did not work. Underneath the monolithic surface, deep
down in the mass of the people, and even higher up in the ruling group,
ferments were released which were bound to escape control. Some people
saw through the evasions and contradictions and began to press for a
more radical and genuine de-Stalinization. Others, especially among the
bureaucracy, took fright at the ideological drifting and called for an
end to the desecration of the old idol; many reacted simply with
disgust and cynicism. Some were raising the demand for the mitigation
or abolition of various forms of administrative control and thought
control, the demand for more freedom; while others, again among the
bureaucracy, afraid that popular discontent and criticism might rise in
a flood, were anxious to close the gates. Khrushchev manoeuvred
uneasily and clumsily between the conflicting pressures until he
exhausted his moral credit. In 1956 he used Stalin as the colossal
scapegoat for all the sins of the Soviet bureaucracy. In 1964 the
bureaucracy quietly made of Khrushchev the scapegoat. But the men who
took over from him inherited all his dilemmas without having any new
programme or any new idea on how to resolve them. Their chief advantage
over Khrushchev was that they could afford to mark time, as he could not.</p>

<p>The division between the de-Stalinizers and the Stalinist die-hards or
crypto-Stalinists has lain on the surface of Soviet politics. It showed
itself in Khrushchev's struggle against Molotov, Kaganovich, and their
followers, and it has been widely reflected in Soviet literature. It
corresponded broadly to the division between those elements in the
ruling group that favoured a gradual and limited liberalization of the
regime and those inclined to uphold the disciplinarian and
authoritarian routines in the management of party and state.
Khrushchev, attempting always to be all things to all men, in the end
antagonized all. The crypto-Stalinists never forgave him his speech at
the 20th Congress. The bureaucrats were eager to avenge themselves on
him for his pogrom of the central economic ministries; and the
disciplinarians resented the latitude he allowed the critics and
muckrakers who exposed not only Stalin's rule but the heavy remnants of
Stalinism, surviving in every sphere of Soviet life. On the other hand,
to the critics and muck-makers, the liberals and the radicals,
Khrushchev's benevolence was only too whimsical and deceptive. They
knew only too well that every one of his liberal gestures made in
public concealed many acts of repression. The writers and the artists
resented his censorship and his attempts to impose on them his crude
and uneducated tastes. In 1964 the anti-Stalinists and the
crypto-Stalinists, the liberalizers and the authoritarians for a moment
joined hands against him, each hoping to gain from his downfall. These
hopes too have been frustrated. Khrushchev's successors have not
identified themselves with either of the opposed groupings. They have
rather tried to do what Khrushchev had done, only to do it with greater
discretion and caution. They have pursued a middle line and have tried
hard to keep the "extremes" at bay.</p>

<p>The division between the de-Stalinizers and the crypto-Stalinists, and
between the liberalizers and the authoritarians, forms only part of the
picture, its most conspicuous and superficial part. Overshadowed by it
there is another division, largely latent and even inchoate but, in the
long term, perhaps more essential, namely, the division between right,
left, and centre. The reappearance of this classical division follows
naturally from the cracking up of the monolith, the essential of which
consisted precisely in suppressing the dialectics inherent in any live
movement or party and in preventing any spontaneous differentiation of
opinion, both within the party and without. The last time the Soviet
Union witnessed any open struggle between right, left, and centre was
in the middle and late 1920's. The present re-differentiation resumes
to some extent, but only to some extent, the trends of the 1920's but
it does so spontaneously, almost unconsciously, and confusedly. And in
view of the change in the social circumstances and in the political
context, the continuity of these trends can be only partial. That the
tendency to a division between right, left and centre is at work in the
international Communist movement is now clear enough, even though that
division is blurred and distorted by many-sided bureaucratic
manipulation, and even though each trend tends to be identified with a
particular national interest and school of thought&ndash;the left
or "ultra-left" with Maoism, the centre with predominant Soviet policy,
and the right with Titoism ant1 its multiple national varieties.
However, a tendency towards this differentiation is discernible within
each Communist party as well, even though each tries to maintain the
official facade of its monolithic unity. This makes it often difficult
to see and evaluate the hidden processes of division. But when the
facade happens to be suddenly and dramatically blown off, as it has
been in China recently, the reality of the division asserts itself. The
Soviet party is hardly more monolithic or more united than the Chinese
was just before the outbreak of the so-called cultural revolution. Here
and there many indications point to the submerged pattern of
differentiation&ndash;I repeat to an inchoate or, at best,
half-potential and half-actual division between right, left, and
centre. The division cannot become fully actual as long as the
groupings involved in it are not free to express themselves and
formulate their ideas or programmes, for it is precisely in the process
of self-expression that ideological trends and political groupings
become conscious of themselves and find their identity.</p>

<p>I should, perhaps, clarify here to some extent my criteria and explain
what attitudes I describe as "left" or "right" in the context of Soviet
social life and Soviet politics at this time.</p>

<p>The specific crucial issues over which the divisions tend to arise are
those of egalitarianism versus privilege; of workers' control, or
workers' participation in control, over industry versus strictly
managerial control; of freedom of expression and association versus
bureaucratic dictatorship and monolithic discipline; and last, but not
least, of socialist internationalism versus nationalism. Any careful
student of Soviet affairs, indeed any attentive reader of Soviet
literature and periodicals, familiar with its Aesopian idiom, will have
little or no difficulty in tracing the conflicting attitudes, as they
reflect themselves in Soviet writings or as they refract themselves in
the zigzags of official policy. These divisions were potentially there
even in Stalin's days, but in those days, society was atomized; and the
human atoms were absolutely unable to combine or coalesce into groups.
They led an existence like that of Leibnitz's Monads, closed within
themselves, isolated from one another, unable to communicate. When
communication did occur, it was a mixed dialogue between two atoms
only, like the one Yevtushenko reports in his <span style="font-style: italic;">Premature Autobiography</span>,
where he describes his ideological wrangling with a fellow poet, a bard
of the Establishment, a Great Russian Chauvinist, anti-Semite and
fervent authoritarian, a Stalinist descendant of the pre-revolutionary
Black Hundreds, against whom Yevtushenko whispered, in hints only, his
feelings about the Jews, his internationalism, his vague longing for an
outlook broader than the official ideology, and his instinctive
distaste for bureaucratic privilege.<a href="#f2">[2]</a></p>

<p>No doubt such dialogues between two atoms went on in various places and
you can detect in them the germ of a controversy between left and
right. But the germ could not germinate and grow. What has been new in
these post-Stalinist years has been the slow, hesitant movement and
coalescence of like-minded atoms into groups, whether in the party
hierarchy or in literature, among the sculptors and painters, the
philosophers, sociologists, historians, scientists, and almost
certainly also at the factory bench and in the kolkhoz community.
People of similar ideological and political disposition recognize one
another and are drawn toward one another. Where previously only
bureaucratic cliques could exist, surrounded by a political vacuum, now
groupings and trends form themselves, though they are still very far
from crystallization. We know of the groupings among the writers who
now engage in public, semi-public, and private controversy. Such
groupings tend to form themselves in other occupations as well in all
walks of life, on all social levels, in all milieus. But we do not hear
about them because those milieus are, of course, not as vocal and
articulate as men of letters normally are. This is largely still a
molecular process, though it is sometimes more than that. And
officialdom, of course, does all that it can to slow down the process
and obstruct it.</p>

<p>It is in this way that the new right and the new left have begun to
stir. Trying to trace the features of the emerging political types, one
is inclined to melancholy reflections about the price the Soviet Union
is still paying, in spiritual and intellectual terms, for the forcible
interruption by Stalinism of all open ideological and political
confrontation. The level of political thinking and expression is
lamentably low. The profile of a man of the right in the 1950's is
simple enough. He usually defends privilege, favours wide discrepancies
in scales of wages and salaries, and tends to be a Great Russian
Chauvinist and power politician; he is contemptuous of the small Soviet
nationalities and of such poor relations as Poles and Hungarians, but,
above all, of the Chinese, against whom he will even vent racial
prejudice. More often than not, he is an anti-Semite. Next to him
stands a more moderate and educated man of the right, who may combine
anti-egalitarianism and distrust of the masses, with a certain
cosmopolitanism, with an eagerness for close relations with the West,
and with an intense fear of any Russian involvement in class struggles
abroad or in anti-imperialist wars of liberation. Western observers
often come across this political type amongst Soviet diplomats,
journalists, and industrial managers: but more plebeian versions of the
type also abound.</p>

<p>The man of the Soviet Left is more often than not an intellectual, a
philosopher, sociologist, or party historian; but he may also be a
worker at the factory bench. He criticizes the present distribution of
the national income, the wide wage differentials, and bureaucratic
privilege. He attacks&ndash;sometimes even in public&ndash;the
secrecy with which the earnings of the various "income groups" are surrounded,
and presses for a radical narrowing of their discrepancies. He favours
shorter working hours in the factories and demands better and wider
educational facilities for working class children. That pressure on all
these points has been effective is evidenced by the concessions which
the ruling group has again and again had to make in regard to them.
This new egalitarianism, inherently hostile to the Stalinist tradition,
is also critical of the social implications of the new economic policy,
with its heavy emphasis on profitability and the "laws of the market".
The man of the Left recalls that Socialism has aspired and should still
aspire to transcend gradually the laws of the market, not by means of
rigid bureaucratic direction, but by a rational economic policy and the
producers' participation in control over the economy. In ideology and
politics, the elements of the Left seek to pick up the threads of the
revolutionary tradition where Stalinism broke them, and to restore the
true history of the revolution and of Bolshevism, for they feel that
only if the ground is cleared to the end of the rubble of Stalinist
legends and myths, will a new socialist consciousness develop in the
people. In foreign affairs men of the left try to grasp the
significance of recent social-revolutionary events in the world, of
Cuba and Vietnam, and of China's internal conflicts; and they attempt
to relate these to Soviet policy. They are, no doubt, perturbed by the
decline of international solidarity in the USSR and by the
quasi-isolationist mood that characterizes both official policy and the
popular frame of mind.</p>

<p>I do not undertake. I don't think anyone can undertake, to judge the
relative strength and weight of these opposed currents of thought and
feeling. Even the characterization of the types is, of necessity,
fragmentary and patchy. Yet it is based on the internal evidence of the
events, and on a wide range of philosophical, economic, sociological
and literary indications. These are the hidden or half-hidden
conflicting pressures under which, I think, Soviet policy finds itself
and by which it is to some extent shaped. Official policy is, of
course, centrist, cagey, and is trying to keep at a safe distance from
the extremes or to reconcile the contradictions. But in the long run
the basic trends seem more important: they are likely to become more
effective as time goes on: they make up the submerged bulk of the
Soviet iceberg.</p>

<p>The two patterns of the ideological and political division, the
division over Stalinism and the conflict between right and left are not
coincidental. They overlap and produce cross-currents. Among the
adherents of de-Stalinization there are some with a rightist and others
with a leftist bias. In the early years after Stalin, Khrushchev sought
to rally the support of both wings; and therein lay his strength. In
his later years, his own policy showed a markedly rightist bias in both
domestic and foreign affairs. This circumstance undoubtedly brought a
measure of discredit upon de-Stalinization. Occasionally, it lent
colour to the Maoist accusation that, by undermining the Stalinist
orthodoxy, Khrushchev released or stimulated latent reactionary forces,
within the Soviet Union as well as without, in Eastern Europe, in
Hungary, Poland and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Thus, paradoxically, the opposition to de-Stalinization, which at first
came only from a rather narrow conservative bureaucratic milieu, found
itself gradually strengthened by a spreading disappointment with
various aspects of Khrushchevism. Seeing that de-Stalinization in
Khrushchev's policy was, in his last years, associated with
anti-egalitarianism, with a virtual wage freeze, and agricultural
failure, and further with the Russo-Chinese feud and the disintegration
of the Soviet Bloc, quite a few people inclined towards egalitarianism
and internationalism became fearful of the implications of
Khrushchevism. Critical, well-informed observers reported, for
instance, in the years 1963 and 1964, the spread of something like a
spontaneous, nostalgic Stalin cult among Soviet factory workers, a mood
which expressed itself in biting popular witticisms contrasting some of
Khrushchev's failures with Stalin's wisdom and foresight. "Do you know
what was the greatest of Stalin's crimes?" went one popular joke, "it
was this, that he did not lay up a stock of grain that would last us
longer than five years of Khrushchev's rule". What a paradox! Who would
have thought in 1956 that anyone in the Soviet Union would only a few
years later look back nostalgically to the Stalin era.<a href="#f3">[3]</a>
But this was, in fact, the outcome of half-hearted, hypocritical and "rightist"
de-Stalinization. One consequence of that state of affairs&ndash;one
would like to hope an ephemeral one&ndash;is that the progressive,
anti-Stalinist intelligentsia found itself frequently isolated from the
mood in the working class. Another is that before the recent uproar and
commotion in China Maoist criticism struck more chords in the Soviet
Union than Soviet officialdom was ready to admit.</p>

<p>Seen against this background the task of Khrushchev's successors has
not been an easy one. They were not well equipped to deal with the
conflicting trends and cross-currents. They represent&ndash;in this
respect the Maoists are right&ndash;Khrushchevism without
Khrushchev. When they turned against their former leader, they held that his
policies had been basically correct, but that he had distorted and
compromised them by his temperamental outbursts, eccentricities, and
excesses. There was a grain of truth in that, but not more.
Khrushchev's behaviour became increasingly erratic as his policies were
leading him into an impasse. He tried to get out of it by alternate
overemphatic gestures of conciliation and by aggressive vituperation,
by attempts to ingratiate himself with his opponents at home or abroad,
and by loud fist-banging or shoe-banging.</p>

<p>There is, in any case, a curiously repetitive logic in all this. It had
been Khrushchev's strongly-held view that Stalin's policy had, over
many years, been basically correct until Stalin spoiled everything by
his morbid lust for power and his excesses. Khrushchev, as it were,
appealed from the latter-day insane Stalin to the alleged sanity of the
earlier Stalinism. Now Brezhnev and Kosygin react in the same way to
Khrushchevism. They seek to rescue it from Khrushchev's latter-day
distortions.</p>

<p>They began by moving on tiptoes and trying to hush discordant voices
around them. There were to be no further drastic exposures of
Stalinism, no more talk about the terrors of the concentration camps of
the past; but there was to be no rehabilitation of Stalinism either,
and no repudiation of the Twentieth and Twenty-second Congresses. There
was to be no further liberalization; but neither was there to be any
drastic curtailment of Khrushchev's semi-liberal reforms. There was to
be no more voicing of egalitarian demands&ndash;the emphasis was and is
on incentive payments and rewards; but neither was there to be any
campaign against the egalitarians. In foreign affairs, Kosygin and
Brezhnev decided to put an end to personal diplomacy <span style="font-style: italic;">a la</span> Khrushchev,
but reasserted their faith in his interpretation of "peaceful
coexistence". They tried to restore the unity of the Communist parties
and to mend the bridge with China; but they are not willing to make any
concessions of substance to the Chinese. Kosygin's first journey, on
assumption of the office of Prime Minister, was to Vietnam and China;
but since this journey yielded no positive results, Moscow decided to
lapse into silence over China, a silence which it maintained for about
two years. To undo the harm that Khrushchev had done to Vietnam, by
declaring just before his downfall that the Soviet Union had no
interest in defending Southeast Asia, his successors reaffirmed
Russia's interest in that area; but they have been rather careful in
doling out aid to the North Vietnamese and the "Viet Cong". At the
twenty-third Congress, Kosygin and Brezhnev declared that the Soviet
aid to the Vietnamese amounted to half a billion roubles, a negligible
sum compared to the many billion dollars spent by the United States on
the war in Vietnam. In a word, theirs was to be the good old
middle-of-the-road Khrushchevism, not the one drifting more and more to
the right, Khrushchevism without Khrushchevian excesses, Khrushchevism
combined with silence, which is golden, and with wait and see.</p>

<p>It seems that the waiting game is drawing to a close. Brezhnev,
Kosygin, and their colleagues are discovering that Khrushchev's
"excesses", distortions, and drifting were not accidental or caused
merely by his temperamental disposition. The point is that one cannot
be afraid of radical egalitarian and of democratic socialist and
internationalist trends indefinitely without lapsing into bureaucratic
conservatism and drifting to the right. Brezhnev and Kosygin are indeed
finding it more and more difficult to maintain a cautious,
non-committal, centrist position. The conflicting pressures from right
and left have been mounting, even if right and left are not any
organized groupings but more or less diffused tendencies and moods.</p>

<p>And so, after an interval of silence, all controversies are resumed,
even though they are as a rule conducted behind closed doors. But there
they are conducted with a vehemence of which the echoes reaching the
Soviet public or the Western World give only a faint idea. Egalitarian
and anti-egalitarian voices are heard again, even though the former are
muffled, and speak less openly than the latter. And in the background
one can discern the renewed, though unfocused, discord between
nationalism and internationalism, and, on a different level, the clash
between various interpretations of peaceful coexistence.<a href="#f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>On all these issues, official policies are slowly but perceptibly
drifting again to the right. The government tries to stem the
anti-Stalinist mood of the intelligentsia that keeps breaking through.
Hence the heavy censorship of recent months. It also attempts to
enhance the position of the managers vis-&agrave;-vis the workers,
although the relative pro-consumer bias of the economic reform may have
its anti-bureaucratic implications as well. But it is, above all, in
foreign policy that, after a period of reticence and immobility,
Brezhnev and Kosygin are driven to follow in Khrushchev's footsteps.
The silence over the conflict with China is broken; and the controversy
is again conducted in public, though the Russian contribution to it has
not yet risen to the high pitch it had reached in Khrushchev's last
days. True, the relentless vehemence and vituperation of the Maoists
and the so-called cultural revolution have provoked the new exchanges.
All the same, the renewal of controversy inevitably strengthens the
nationalist mood in the USSR and brings out its faintly racial
undertones. In diplomacy, the embarrassed <span style="font-style: italic;">immobilisme</span> of 1964
and 1965 is giving place to a new period of active maneuvering. The Soviet Prime
Minister has in recent months indulged quite freely in that personal
diplomacy which he and Brezhnev had censured not so long ago.<a href="#f5">[5]</a>
The return to Khrushchevian diplomacy and to the Khrushchevian
interpretation of peaceful coexistence has been strikingly exemplified
by the recent signature of the Soviet-American agreement on withholding
nuclear weapons from outer space. What is important here is not so much
the agreement itself, which is of course unobjectionable, as its
timing; coming at the moment of intensified American escalation of the
war in Vietnam, this act has certainly been considered as ill-timed by
some military "hawks" in Moscow; and it is not only the hawks who feel
uneasy over the USSR's role in the Vietnamese conflict. Obviously
recent events have done much to aggravate the quarrel with China even
further. The logic of the situation had led the present leaders to do
what Khrushchev had done; namely, to try and rally foreign Communist
parties against China and to obtain from them a formal condemnation of
Maoism. That the Communist parties have apparently proved as reluctant
to respond as they were in Khrushchev's days is all the more
remarkable, as the Chinese had in the meantime done their best, or
their worst, to enhance the Soviet position in the Communist movement.</p>

<p>It seems to me that Soviet policy is indeed heading for an impasse very
similar to that of 1964. At home Khrushchevism without Khrushchev
cannot contain or stop the growing momentum of the contending trends.
It is doubtful whether any government or party leadership not willing
to allow those trends to come into the open can break the domestic
deadlock. No government can do this that is not resolved to carry
de-Stalinization to a democratic socialist consummation, that is, to an
open confrontation of the now submerged ideological and political
currents. These currents can be tested only in an open, nationwide
debate, which would enable Soviet society to achieve its ideological
self-determination. Similarly, in foreign affairs, no government or
party leadership addicted to the sacred national egoism in which Stalin
bred the present generation of leaders can cope with the disintegration
of the Soviet Bloc. The centrifugal forces now at work in Communism can
be overcome, if at all, only on the basis of a democratically oriented
socialist internationalism. Whether the forces that might work towards
such a way out are strong enough, I cannot undertake to judge. The war
in Vietnam and the outcome of the crisis in China will undoubtedly have
their impact on developments in the USSR and influence the ideological
balance. In any case, we need not take at its face value the apparent
uneventfulness of the post-Khrushchevian period. In this respect, as in
many others, the upheaval in China teaches a lesson. Who would have
thought two years ago, that so much turmoil was pent up behind China's
monolithic facade and that so many contradictions, some of them highly
"antagonistic", were just about to explode in Mao's face? I am not
claiming that I know that the Soviet political barometer is also set on
storm. It may well be that current difficulties may just prolong the
chronic post-Stalinist crisis in which the Soviet Union has lived since
the end of Stalin; but they may also bring it to a sharp and dramatic
turn.</p>
