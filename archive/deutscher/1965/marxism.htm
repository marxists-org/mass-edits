<p>What is our time, for a Marxist and for Marxism? Is it a time of the
ascendancy of Marxism? Or is it an epoch of the decline of Marxism? In
those countries where Marxism is supposed to be the ruling doctrine,
the official answer is, of course, that this is a time of an unseen,
unheard of, unprecedented flourishing of Marxism in theory and
practice. Here in the West, especially in our Anglo-Saxon countries, we
are told day in and day out, goodness knows from how many academic and
other platforms, that Marxism has not only declined, but that it is
irrelevant &ndash; that it bears no relation to the problems of our
epoch. From my native country, Poland, comes the voice of a brilliant
young philosopher, but a very poor political analyst, who tells us that
it is no use discussing Marxism any longer because Marxism has already
gained and won and conquered the human mind to such an extent that it
has become an organic part of contemporary thinking, and this marks the
end of every great doctrine &ndash; when it becomes the organic part of
human thought. This young philosopher lived in Warsaw after an epoch of
Stalinism during which he and people of his generation identified
Stalinism and Marxism. They knew Marxism only in the Stalinist form;
they were served, and they accepted, the official Marxism as Stalinism
and Stalinism as Marxism. Now they want to get away from Stalinism, and
this &ndash; as they equated Stalinism and Marxism &ndash; means for
them getting away from Marxism. It seems to me &ndash; such is the
bitter dialectic of our epoch &ndash; that Marxism is in ascendancy and
decline simultaneously.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of my adult life (that is, over forty years
ago), I have been a Marxist, and I have never for a moment hesitated in
my &ndash; I wouldn't say allegiance because it is not a matter of
"allegiance&rdquo; &ndash; I have never hesitated in my Marxist <i>Weltanschauung</i>.
I cannot think otherwise than in Marxist terms. Kill me, I cannot do
it. I may try; I just cannot. Marxism has become part of my existence.
As someone who owes this kind of "allegiance" to Marxism, I would not
like to give any of you, who perhaps only recently made an acquaintance
with Marxism, the idea that this is one of the golden ages of the
Marxist doctrine. Far from it. This is a time of triumph for Marxism
only insofar as this is an age of revolution which develops an
anticapitalist, a postcapitalist kind of society. But it is also an age
of degeneration of Marxist thought and of intellectual decline for the
labor movement at large. Precisely because the modern labor movement
cannot find another creative and fertile doctrine except Marxism, all
its intellectual standards decline catastrophically whenever and
wherever Marxism becomes ossified. We have an expansion in Marxist
practice and a shrinkage and degeneration in Marxist thinking. There is
a deep divorce between the practical experience of revolution and the
whole Marxist theoretical framework within which that revolution has
been anticipated, within which that revolution has been justified on
philosophical, historical, economic, political, cultural, and, if you
like, even moral grounds.</p>
<p>For a student of philosophical or historical schools of thought and
doctrines this is not an extraordinary statement. Almost every really
great school of thought that dominated the thinking of generations has
known its periods of great expansion, awakening and development, and
its periods of decadence and decline. In this respect the only other
school of thought that comes to mind is the Aristotelian school, which
dominated human intellect for nearly two thousand years. In the course
of this series of epochs it went through various phases of great
creative interpretation and creative influence, and also epochs in
which it found its triumph in a parody of itself, in the medieval
Catholic scholasticism which, although based on Aristotelian
philosophy, yet bore to it the same relationship which caricature bears
to the real picture of an original object. This did not deprive the
Aristotelian philosophy even in the Middle Ages of its raison
d'&ecirc;tre, of its creative phases, of its stimuli which still
existed and later helped medieval Europe to overcome the scholastical
degeneration. In this respect Marxism stands comparison with the
Aristotelian philosophy as a way of thinking that epitomizes and
generalizes the entire social, economic, and, to some extent, the
political experience of the world under capitalism and exposes the
inner dynamism of the historical development which is bound to lead
from capitalism to some other postcapitalist order, which we have
agreed to describe as a socialist order.</p>
<p>Marxism is not an intellectual, aesthetic, or philosophical fashion,
no matter what the fashion-mongers imagine. After having been
infatuated with it for a season or two they may come and declare it to
be obsolete. Marxism is a way of thinking, a generalization growing out
of an immense historical development; and as long as this historic
phase in which we live has not been left far behind us, the doctrine
may prove to be mistaken on points of detail or secondary points, but
in its essence nothing has deprived it, and nothing looks like
depriving it, of its relevance, validity, and importance for the
future. But at the same time we face the problem of degeneration in
Marxist thinking. We have the divorce between theory and practice, and
we have a striking, and to a Marxist often humiliating, contrast
between what I call classical Marxism &ndash; that is, the body of
thought developed by Marx, Engels, their contemporaries, and after them
by Kautsky, Plekhanov, Lenin, Trotsky, Rosa Luxemburg &ndash; and the
vulgar Marxism, the pseudo-Marxism of the different varieties of
European social-democrats, reformists, Stalinists, Khrushchevites, and
their like. I am speaking here of a contrast between classical and
vulgar Marxism by analogy with the way in which Marx spoke of classical
and vulgar economy. You know that for Marx the term "classical economy"
has a different meaning from the one it has in your textbooks at the
London School of Economics. According to your textbooks, if I am not
mistaken, classical economy lasts till the very end of the nineteenth
and even the beginning of the twentieth century, and Marshall still
forms part of it. To Karl Marx classical economy ends practically with
Ricardo. All that follows is for him the vulgar economy of the
bourgeoisie, and for a very good reason. In the classical economy, in
Ricardo and Smith, Marx saw the main elements out of which he developed
his own theory, especially the labor theory of value &ndash; of value
based on human labor. This was the revolutionary element in the
classical bourgeois political economy. For this revolutionary element
the bourgeoisie had no use later on and, moreover, was afraid of it.
Post-Ricardian economy wants to deduce value from anything but human
labor. Later schools of vulgar economy deduce value from circulation;
still later they "dismiss" value altogether and build a political
economy without it because in this concept of value created by human
labor was the seed of revolution. And bourgeois thinking instinctively
shied away from it and, frightened, turned in other directions.
Classical economy, the economic thinking of Smith and Ricardo, Marx
argued, had given an insight into the working of capitalism that far
exceeded the practical needs of the bourgeois class.</p>
<p>Ricardo, who understood capitalism so well, knew that the
bourgeoisie neither wished nor could afford to understand the workings
of its own system, and therefore it had to get away from the labor
theory of value in the first instance. This phenomenon of a doctrine
and a theory that offers insights into the working of a social system
far greater than are the practical requirements of the social class for
which it is meant &ndash; this phenomenon occurs sometimes in history.
And it has occurred with Marxism. The body of classical Marxist thought
gave such profound, immense, and till this day unexhausted and
unexplored riches of insight that the working class for its practical
purposes seemed not to need it. This idea was once expressed by Rosa
Luxemburg on the occasion of the publication of the second and third
volumes of <i>Das Kapita</i>l. She said that the social-democratic
movement in Europe had conducted its propaganda and agitation in the
course of thirty or forty years on the basis of the first volume of <i>Das
Kapita</i>l &ndash; that is, on the basis of a fragment of Marx's
economic theory; then came the second and the third volume and the huge
structure was rising before our eyes &ndash; yet the labor movement did
not at all feel that it conducted its practical and theoretical
activities on an inadequate foundation: the intellectual content even
of the fragment of <i>Das Kapita</i>l was quite sufficient to keep, so
to speak, the labor movement intellectually alive for decades.</p>
<p>Marx created a body of thought far in excess of the narrow practical
needs of the movement for which he intended his work to serve. Then
came the vulgarization, which was in sharp contrast with the original
doctrine but which reflected the requirements of the labor movements
and of the revolutions that were coming under the banner of Marxism. I
hope I have explained in what sense I am using these terms &ndash;
classical Marxism and vulgar Marxism. I shall perhaps sum up my
argument: classical Marxism offers deep historical insight into the
working of capitalism, into the prospects of the dissolution of
capitalism, and, broader still, into man's relation under this system
with other men, with his own class and other classes, his relationship
and attitude towards the technology of his age. Vulgar Marxism does not
need all that insight; it is fully satisfied with a small fraction of
all that understanding, which it places in the severely limited orbit
of practical needs, practical strivings, and practical tasks. We have
here a historic hypertrophy of practice and an atrophy of thought.
Practice is sometimes the enemy of thought; thought sometimes suffers
from contact with practice. Here is the dialectic in its crystalline
form: basically thought can exist only through contact with practice;
practice cannot in the long run ignore theory. Nevertheless there are
these temporary, transitional periods of unresolved tensions between
theory and practice, and it is in such a period that we have been
living these last decades. These unresolved tensions affect the whole
structure of Marxist thinking.</p>
<p>The intellectual structure of classical Marxism was entirely based
on the assumption of a socialist revolution taking place within a
mature capitalist bourgeois society. The vulgar Marxism of our decade,
by which I mean the Marxism that comes from the postcapitalist third of
the world, is all based on the fact of revolutions occurring within
underdeveloped societies. Now, how does this affect the structure of
Marxist thinking?</p>
<p>If a revolution takes place in a mature bourgeois society, then what
you assume, and what would in fact follow, would be first of all a
material abundance, an abundance of goods, an abundance of means of
production and a relative or even an absolute abundance of means of
consumption, an abundance of human skills, of tools, of abilities, of
experience, of resources, an abundance of culture. If the revolution
takes place in underdeveloped societies, then the basic, decisive, and
determining factor with which we have to reckon is the all-round
scarcity: scarcity of means of production, of means of consumption, of
skills, of abilities, of schools, scarcity of civilization and of
culture &ndash; scarcity all round &ndash; only an abundance or
super-abundance of revolutionary elements. If abundance is the basis of
the whole structure of the revolution and of Marxist thinking within
the revolution, political freedom is the element which you take for
granted. Even if a revolution entails civil war and the dictatorship of
the proletariat, this is viewed as a transitory phase during which the
dictatorship is to serve only one immediate purpose: the breaking down
of the armed resistance of the former possessing classes, but not the
disciplining or forcing into obedience of the working classes or even
the middle classes of one's own society. Marx rarely, if ever, spoke
about "political freedom&rdquo;. Precisely because he assumed a
revolution amid the abundance of a mature bourgeois society, he took
political freedom so much for granted that he discussed only, so to
say, the higher mathematics of freedom, those refinements of genuine
freedom of which only a socialist society would be capable. On the
basis of material scarcity there is no freedom. On the basis of
abundance there would be no need for those sharply differentiated wage
scales, the Stakhanovism,<a href="#ftn1" name="ftnref1">[1]</a> and
other systems and tricks which result in the recreation of revolting
inequality. This inequality was inevitable in a society like the
Russian one where &ndash; as I used to argue in the old days &ndash;
fifty million pairs of shoes were produced for a nation of one hundred
and sixty million. This was my old argument and old simile; but it is
still valid, in one way or another, if applied to nearly all the
underdeveloped countries.</p>
<p>In a revolution which takes its course amid abundance and growing
equality, there is no question of constraint in cultural matters. This
coercion and constraint is presented to you as proletarian culture, as
socialist culture. The constraint in the cultural field comes from
nothing else but political fear. Censors confiscate poems because they
are afraid that these poems may become political manifestoes. When the
censors call for novels of "social realism," they wage a preventive
battle against political manifestoes of opposition or revolution that
might come not even from the poets, but from very prosaic young men
somewhere in factories or universities. Intellectual constraint goes
together with political constraint, with scarcity, with inequality.</p>
<p>Classical Marxism never envisaged "socialism in a single country"
&ndash; in Germany, or in France, or in England. Its ground was always
Europe, at the very least Western Europe. It was always international
in its outlook; yet in the actual historical development it became
national in scale. It became national in the sense in which Stalin
viewed socialism within the framework of a single state on the basis of
economic and even cultural self-sufficiency. This was a profoundly
anti-Marxist view. It was the reflection of the false consciousness of
the isolated Russian Revolution. Till this day in the East &ndash; in
Russia, in China, among the foremost Stalinists in Eastern Europe
&ndash; the whole way of thinking is still shaped by the tradition, the
implications, and the tacit assumptions of "socialism in a single
country," that is, of autarkic socialism, closed within itself. And of
course, while you have scarcity, lack of freedom, inequality, cultural
and intellectual coercion, and socialism on a national scale, and
consequently the renewed struggle of nationalisms, you have a new form
of what it is now fashionable to call, after the youthful Marx, <i>alienation</i>.
This is a new form of alienation; man feels estranged from society; he
is the plaything of what looks to him like blind social forces. He
himself forms part of these forces, which are of his own making, and
yet he is their victim. To Marx this estrangement from society was
unthinkable in a socialist society, a society which was to grow out of
the rich soil of mature capitalist civilization. However, contrary to
Marx's expectations the revolution did not develop in Europe, in
countries which we like to describe as the cradles of Western
civilization, but in the East. And there, in the East, Marx's socialism
could not be built. How could it if no material basis for it existed?
People there could only engage in the primitive accumulation of the
preconditions of socialism; and this they are achieving. Let us not be
supercilious, and let us not belittle their immense task and their
immense achievement. They are learning with long delays what the
Western European nations had learned generations earlier, but they also
know what the nations of the West never learned. The development is
combined. There is backwardness and there is tremendous progress
&ndash; it would be unrealistic ever to leave out of sight any one of
these contradictory aspects of history.</p>
<p>"Why then did the West not respond to the appeal of Marxism?&rdquo;
I will be asked. The revolution first won in a country which was
underdeveloped and backward in 1917; underdeveloped and backward in its
whole social structure despite its brilliant and fantastic
artistic-literary achievement. The whole edifice was going up on
unstable, unhealthy foundations and in the process became as if
adjusted to these existing conditions of backwardness. Full of <i>Galgenhumor</i>,
old communists used to sigh: "Couldn't God help us to start the
upheaval in a more suitable country than this Russia of the muzhiks?"
NO, God did not help. Hence, the incongruity of a modern revolution
against the background of murky age-old traditions. This had its
negative impact on the possibilities of revolutionary development in
the West. The revolution in a precapitalist society, which nevertheless
aspired to achieve socialism, produced a hybrid which in many respects
looked like a parody of socialism. The western worker, however
seemingly non-political, followed events very carefully and was quite
aware of the famines, the hunger, and the deprivation that the people
of Russia suffered after the revolution; he was aware of the terror and
persecution they were subjected to. And, unsophisticated as he was, the
British worker, the German worker, and even the French one, often
wondered: Is this socialism? Have we perhaps in our century-old
allegiance to socialism followed a dangerous will-o'-the wisp? Workers
have been asking themselves these questions. Uncertain, hesitant, the
Western European worker has preferred to wait and see. The Russian
Revolution has acted as a deterrent to revolution in the West.</p>
<p>By and large we must look at the developments in the West and the
relation of Marxism to the course of the class struggle in the West as
upon a war which has lasted for generations &ndash; for a century and a
half. And this class war has had its ups and downs, its intervals, its
pitched battles, its long lulls between battles and campaigns. Anyone
may say during a lull between two pitched battles: "Ah, your Marx said
history is the history of class struggle and there is no class
struggle!" Of course, when Marx wrote in the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>
that the history of mankind is the history of class wars, he knew
perfectly well that there were times during which the war of the
classes was at a very low ebb, almost stagnant. Churchill once wrote
that the history of mankind is the history of wars &ndash; perhaps an
unconscious plagiarism from Marx? The difference, of course, is that
for Marx it is the history of class war, and for Churchill it is the
history of war tout court. But Churchill also knew that wars are not
fought ceaselessly; and Marx also knew that class wars have their time
of truce, of open struggle, latent struggle, doldrums and intervals.</p>
<p>We have had a war against capitalism lasting many generations. There
was 1848, 1870, 1905, 1917-18, 1945-46: all great battles, concluded
partly with a victory of revolution in the East, and with heavy defeats
of the revolution in the West. Marx never promised victories for the
revolutions at any definite date of the calendar. All that he forecast
was that there was going to be a struggle, a heavy, at times a bloody
struggle, between classes and peoples, a struggle that would go on for
generations and which should &ndash; if civilization did not in the
meantime collapse into barbarity &ndash; lead to the dissolution of
capitalism and the emergence of socialism. And, of course, parallel
with this there has also been a mobilization of all the forces of the
counterrevolution. Those who like to speak now about the unfulfilled
prophecies of Marx &ndash; do they imagine (how shall I put it?), do
they imagine that Marx was as shallow as his critics and saw the road
towards socialism without the barricades of counterrevolution? We have
had the mobilization of counterrevolution all over the world, in all
its various forms, from fascism to the most refined social-democratic
reformism, all mobilized in the defense of the existing social order.
Those forces have benefited from every difficulty, from every wound in
the body of socialism. Never yet, except in extraordinary moments like
the Commune of Paris, has the working class mobilized itself even to a
fraction of that intensity and strength at which the possessing and
ruling classes have maintained their mobilization on an almost
permanent footing. Even during the Commune the insurgents never really
mobilized for a life-and-death struggle &ndash; we have all the
descriptions showing their light-mindedness, their good-humored and
good-tempered optimism.</p>
<p>When I speak of classical Marxism and of its validity, I have in
mind what is essential in Marx. Marx was politically active in 1847-48,
in 1868, and 1878; he wrote letters to his friends and to Engels in
which he expressed his hope that perhaps the labor movement would take
a revolutionary impetus in a year's time, in two or three years. And
then Engels, after his friend's death, was writing to his disciples
&ndash; and there were many of them in Western Europe &ndash;
communicating to them his hope still to live and see the coming
together of the workers of Britain and France and Germany. It was only
natural that they had all these sanguine expectations but they were
also thinkers who could step back from their immediate and tactical
involvements and look at the historical perspective. There was Marx who
laid the foundations of the First International and hoped that soon,
very soon, that International would be able to produce some great
upheaval. But there was also Marx who was writing <i>Das Kapita</i>l,
and he did not commit himself in this severely scientific and
historical work to any forecast or any prophecy except to a conclusion
which followed from his profound, detailed and meticulous analysis of
capitalism &ndash; the conclusion that this system must collapse
because its inner contradictions would not allow it to function in the
long run. When it will dissolve and collapse &ndash; into this he never
entered, not because (as so many of his clever critics suggest) he was
so clever, but because he had a sense of responsibility. A politician
may have to bank on certain events occurring within a certain time; he
can rally for the coming struggle his own strength and that of his
friends and followers. The historical thinker cannot do this; nor can
he foresee the complications of history or map out its exact route.</p>
<p>I said that I shall concentrate on what is essential in Marx and I
have slipped into what is inessential, so allow me just to touch on
another problem which is marginal, namely the problem whether the
working class under capitalism is condemned to absolute impoverishment.
This has long been passionately discussed in the European, and
especially in the French, Communist Parties. Well, you can find in Marx
some support for such a theory and you can find some refutation of it.
Marx's mind was too rich and complex to play with narrow formulae. In
Marx's time, in Western Europe, there certainly were empirical facts
which pointed to progressive and absolute impoverishment.</p>
<p>But let us return to the very essentials in the Marxist critique of
capitalism. When people say that Marxism was a doctrine, highly
elaborate and realistic for the nineteenth century but now obsolete,
may we ask: obsolete in what? In its essentials? There is one, only
one, essential element in the Marxist critique of capitalism. It is
very simple and very plain, but in it are focused all the many-faceted
analyses of the capitalist order. It is this: there is a striking
contradiction between the increasingly social character of the process
of production and the antisocial character of capitalist property. Our
mode of existence, the whole manner of production, is becoming more and
more social in the sense that the old free-lance producers can no
longer go on producing in independence from each other, from generation
to generation, as they did in the precapitalist system. Every element,
every fraction, every little tiny organ of our society is dependent on
all the rest. The whole process of production becomes one social
process of production &ndash; and not only one national process of
production but one international process of production. At the same
time you have an antisocial kind of property, private property. This
contradiction between the antisocial character of property and the
social character of our production is the source of all anarchy and
irrationality in capitalism.</p>
<p>This contradiction cannot be reconciled &agrave; la longue. The
collision must come. That was all that Marx said. Now, has this
essential critique of capitalism become obsolete? We are told that it
has, that since Keynes capitalism knows how to plan the economy. For
eighty years planning was supposed to be a bee in Marx's bonnet. Now
that bee has been elevated almost to a divine insect, and we are told
that capitalism can also plan. Has it ever planned except for war
purposes? If it has, I have not yet heard of such a case. But suppose
that it can. Is planning congenial to capitalism? Some capitalist
enterprises were, after all, conducted on a feudal basis; one can also,
I suppose, create a simulacrum of socialism on a capitalist basis. But
is this congenial to capitalism? And can capitalism, even when it
plans, achieve the rate of growth that planning in a really publicly
owned economy has achieved? Of course not, because if there is national
or international planning, then national or international ownership and
organization are the congenial and natural conditions for planning. You
can, of course, put planning into capitalism, but it is almost like
putting a motor engine into a horsedrawn drozhka. And can capitalism
create international societies? You will say: What about the Russians
and the Chinese? Have they created an international society? Of course
not. The way in which the Russians and the Chinese conduct their
affairs is still a reflection of a capitalist way of thinking. But
there it is a reflection of capitalism, a projection of capitalism into
a postcapitalist structure of society, while here it is historically
inherent in the whole working of the capitalist order. Wherever
capitalism tries to break out of its national crust, it always does so
in a catastrophic way, by staging world wars, by swallowing smaller and
weaker nations or competitors.</p>
<p>If you look at the nearly two decades of postwar capitalist
prosperity, what do you see? A refutation of Marxism? This is not the
first time in history that we have seen twenty years running their
course without the old-type slump and boom that have been
characteristic of capitalism from at least 1825 to the Second World
War. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-7I there were twenty-five
years of Germany's tremendous industrialization, of capitalist
development without a real crisis. At the end of these twenty-five
years came the revisionists, the friends and disciples of Marx and
Engels, who said: "The masters must have been mistaken. They said there
would be a collapse, there would be crises, there would be slumps.
There are no slumps. From now on capitalism will develop smoothly in an
evolutionary manner." And after only a few years, in 1907, came the
tremendous collapse. Then the next tremendous slump led into the First
World War.</p>
<p>I don't want to be a Cassandra, but I cannot say that I have
confidence in the further smooth, evolutionary development of Western
capitalism, or in the perpetuation of its so-called prosperity. After
these twenty years of prosperity, what do we see in Western society? We
see an intensification of all those trends which Karl Marx diagnosed as
the trends leading to the further development of capitalism and its
doom. We see all over the West the disappearance of those middle
classes that were supposed to constitute the conservative foundation of
capitalism; of the small-owning, smallholding peasantry. The peasantry
that was the mainstay of French conservatism is vanishing, and France
has ceased to be a peasant country. So have most Western European
countries. America has no peasants, and only a small percentage of its
population is engaged in farming. That was what Marx prophesied: that
what will be left will be the bourgeoisie and the propertyless working
class. For decades it seemed that this particular prognostication was
not coming true. Karl Kautsky wrote a very learned and voluminous work
on the agrarian problem, in which he explained why in agriculture there
was no such concentration of capital as there was in industry.
Nevertheless, he maintained, the Marxist prognosis was correct. Lenin
accepted Kautsky's argument and pointed out that the peasantry remained
in existence although it was getting progressively impoverished. Now
this peasantry is vanishing! The proletariat is growing in numbers.
Proletarianization, that horror of the bourgeoisie, is progressing with
every year of our prosperity, with every year of our welfare state. The
processes of production are becoming larger and larger in scale,
centralized, social in character, calling more and more for social
control, for social ownership. The productive forces of our countries
cry out against the national self-sufficiency in which tradition and
the ruling classes have kept them. That is the Marxist inferno coming
through, almost invisibly, almost unnoticed, in the midst of this
welfare state paradise.</p>
<p>In the meantime, one feels as if the whole development of class
struggle here in the West has become arrested for a while, waiting for
some great chapters to come to a close. There is one great trend in the
historic development which promises &ndash; but this is only a promise
&ndash; to turn the whole tide of Marxism and socialism: the growth of
the productive forces of the Soviet Union, and with it that of the
other postcapitalist countries. The process of primitive socialist
accumulation, which has caused such tremendous distortion in the
intellectual and moral structure of Marxism, does not have long to run.
I do not know whether this is a matter of another decade or two, but
the development will come full circle when Russia, this underdeveloped
and backward country, and with it the other countries, will at last
turn fully into modern, industrial nations &ndash; when the educated
countries (with a socialist tradition surviving in them in spite of
everything) realize in their midst those preconditions for socialism of
which Marx and Engels and generations of socialists had dreamed: the
material and cultural abundance, the lack of constraint in politics and
in culture, the growing equality, the growing internationalism.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that despite the very ugly scenes between Moscow and
Peking, the social systems of those countries are more intelligent and
more progressive than their leaders. The social systems will force the
leaders into internationalism even if they are the most chauvinistic
idiots under the sun; they will push and drive them aside and bring out
new people who will be capable of following the call of
internationalism that comes today from the whole of mankind. And when
this happens the development of those countries will not only catch up
with classical Marxism, but it will probably surpass it. So, I think,
we can confidently look forward to the prospect, even if it is not an
imminent one, that theory and practice in Marxism will come together
again. You and people of your generation should look wholeheartedly to
this perspective, when Marxism will no longer be the Marxism with which
we had to live &ndash; the Marxism projected through the distorting
prism of backwardness, of backward civilization and backward societies.
Your generation, I hope, will see this new upsurge, this new ascendancy
of Marxism undimmed by any intellectual decline.</p>
<p>Marxism and socialism have been the products of Western Europe. They
have gone out of Western Europe to conquer the world and they have lost
ground in Western Europe. When will they come back? The country in
medieval Europe from which the rest of Europe learned the arts of
capitalism was Italy. The Italian cities, the Italian economists, the
Italian bankers were the foremost in Europe. And then, in the
nineteenth century, when nearly the whole of Europe had already gone
bourgeois, Italy had not yet achieved its own capitalism. Capitalism
came back to Italy belatedly, after the whole of Europe had accepted
it. Is Western Europe going to be the Italy of socialism? Are we going
to wait until Marxism and socialism have conquered the world, and then
stand there, last in the queue, waiting for its return to us? Or shall
we save ourselves from our own increasing and terrifying backwardness?</p>
