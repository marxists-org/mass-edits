<h3><a name="h1">i</a></h3>

<p class="fst">For some time, for many decades, the materialist conception of 
history - the first-born intellectual child of Marx and Engels - has been 
growing in self-confidence. As a mature practice (&#8216;historical materialism&#8217;) it 
is perhaps the strongest discipline deriving from the Marxist tradition. Even in 
my own lifetime as a historian - and in the work of my own compatriots - the 
advances have been considerable, and one had supposed these to be advances in <i>
knowledge</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">This is not to say that this knowledge is finite, or subject to 
some &#8216;proof&#8217; of positivistic scientism. Nor is it to suppose that the advance 
has been unilinear and un-problematic. Sharp disagreements exist, and complex 
problems remain not only unsolved but scarcely even disclosed. It is possible 
that the very success of historical materialism as a practice has encouraged a 
conceptual lethargy which is now bringing down upon our heads its necessary 
revenge. And this is the more possible in those parts of the English-speaking 
world where a vigorous practice of historical materialism has been conducted 
within an inherited &#8216;empirical&#8217; idiom of discourse which is reproduced by strong 
educational and cultural traditions.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">All this is possible, even probable. Even so, the case should not 
be over-stated. For what a philosopher, who has only a casual acquaintance with 
historical practice, may glance at and then dismiss, with a ferocious scowl, as 
&#8216;empiricism&#8217;, may in fact be the result of arduous confrontations, pursued both 
in conceptual engagements (the definition of appropriate questions, the 
elaboration of hypotheses, and the exposure of ideological attributions in 
pre-existing historiography) and also in the interstices of historical method 
itself. And the Marxist historiography which now has an international presence 
has contributed significantly not only to its own self-criticism and maturation 
(in <i>theoretical</i> ways), but also to imposing (by repeated controversies, 
much arduous intellectual labour, and some polemic) its presence upon orthodox 
historiography: imposing (in Althusser&#8217;s sense) its own - or Marx&#8217;s - 
&#8216;problematic&#8217; upon significant areas of historical enquiry.</p>

<p class="fst">Engaged in these confrontations we had, I suppose, neglected our 
lines of theoretical supply. For in the moment when we seemed to be poised for 
further advances, we have been suddenly struck from the rear - and not from a 
rear of manifest &#8216;bourgeois ideology&#8217; but from a rear claiming to be more 
Marxist than Marx. From the quarter of Louis Althusser and his numerous 
followers there has been launched an unmeasured assault upon &#8216;historicism: The 
advances of historical materialism, its supposed &#8216;knowledge&#8217;, have rested - it 
turns out - upon one slender and rotten epistemological pillar (&#8216;empiricism&#8217;); 
when Althusser submitted this pillar to a stern interrogation it shuddered and 
crumbled to dust; and the whole enterprise of historical materialism collapsed 
in ruins around it. Not only does it turn out that men have never &#8216;made their 
own history&#8217; at all (being only <i>träger</i> or vectors of ulterior structural 
determinations) but it is also revealed that the enterprise of historical 
materialism - the attainment of historical knowledge - has been misbegotten from 
the start, since &#8216;real&#8217; history is unknowable and cannot be said to exist. In 
the words of two post-Althusserians, whose merit it is to have carried 
Althusserian logic to its own <i>reductio ad absurdam,</i> &#8216;History is condemned 
by the nature of its object to empiricism.&#8217; But empiricism, as we know, is a 
disreputable manifestation of bourgeois ideology: &#8216;Despite the empiricist claims 
of historical practice the real object of history is inaccessible to knowledge.&#8217; 
It follows that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Marxism, as a theoretical and a political practice, gains 
nothing from its association with historical writing and historical research. 
The study of history is not only scientifically but also politically valueless.&#8221;<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The project to which many lifetimes, in successive generations, 
have been given is thus exposed as an illusion (if &#8216;innocent&#8217;) and something 
worse (if not). And yet historical materialists, of my own generation, have been 
slow to acknowledge their own abject exposure. They go on working in their old, 
reprobate ways. Some are too busy to have read the indictments entered against 
them, but those who have appear to have reacted in one of two ways. Many have 
glanced at the antagonist in a casual way, seeing it as a weird apparition, a 
freak of intellectual fashion, which, if they close their eyes, will in time go 
away. They may be right in the first assumption - that Althusserian &#8216;Marxism&#8217; is 
an intellectual freak - but it will not for that reason go away. Historians 
should know that freaks, if tolerated - and even flattered and fed - can show 
astonishing influence and longevity. (After all, to any rational mind, the 
greater part of the history of ideas is a history of freaks.) This particular 
freak (I will argue) has now lodged itself firmly in a particular social <i>
couche,</i> the bourgeois <i>lumpen-inlelligentsia</i><a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a>: 
aspirant intellectuals, whose amateurish intellectual preparation disarms them 
before manifest absurdities and elementary philosophical blunders, and whose 
innocence in intellectual practice leaves them paralysed in the first web of 
scholastic argument which they encounter; and <i>bourgeois,</i> because while 
many of them would <i>like</i> to be &#8216;revolutionaries&#8217;, they are themselves the 
products of a particular &#8216;conjuncture&#8217; which has broken the circuits between 
intellectuality and practical experience (both in real political movements, and 
in the actual segregation imposed by contemporary institutional structures), and 
hence they are able to perform <i>imaginary</i> revolutionary psycho-dramas (in 
which each outbids the other in adopting ferocious verbal postures) while in 
fact falling back upon a very old tradition of bourgeois elitism for which 
Althusserian theory is exactly tailored. Whereas their forebears were political 
interventionists, they tend more often to be diversionists (enclosed and 
imprisoned within their own drama) or &#8216;internal emigrees&#8217;<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> 
Their practical importance remains, however considerable, in disorganising the 
constructive intellectual discourse of the Left, and in reproducing continually 
the elitist division between theory and practice. Maybe, if we suffer 
experiences sharp enough, the freak <i>will</i> eventually go away, and many of 
its devotees may be reclaimed for a serious political and intellectual movement. 
But it is time that we pushed it along the road.</p>

<p class="fst">The other reaction commonly found among historical materialists 
is more reprehensible - that of complicity. They glance at Althusserian Marxism 
and do not wholly understand it (nor like what they understand), but they accept 
it, as &#8216;a&#8217; Marxism. Philosophers cannot be expected to understand history (or 
anthropology, or literature, or sociology) but Althusser is a philosopher doing 
his own thing. And some conceptual rigour is no doubt necessary; perhaps even 
bits can be borrowed (&#8216;over-determination&#8217;, &#8216;instances&#8217;)? After all, we are all 
Marxists together. In this way, a sort of tacit compromise is negotiated, 
although most of the negotiation is made up of silence, and <i>all</i> the 
negotiation consists in ceding ground to Althusser. For Althusser has never 
offered compromise of any kind: and certainly not to &#8216;historicism&#8217;, &#8216;humanism&#8217; 
and &#8216;empiricism.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">This is reprehensible because it is theoretically unprincipled.</p>

<p class="fst">Althusser and his acolytes challenge, centrally, historical 
materialism itself. They do not offer to modify it but to displace it. In 
exchange they offer an a-historical theoreticism which, at the first 
examination, discloses itself as idealism. How then is it possible for these two 
to co-exist within one single tradition? Either a very extraordinary mutation 
has been taking place, in the last few years, in the Marxist tradition: or that 
tradition is now breaking apart into two - or several - parts. What is being 
threatened - what is now actively rejected - is the entire tradition of 
substantive Marxist historical and political analysis, and its accumulating (if 
provisional) knowledge. And if (as I suppose) Althusserian Marxism is not only 
an idealism but has many of the attributes of a <i>theology</i>, then what is at 
issue, within the Marxist tradition, is the defence of reason itself.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">ii</a></h3>

<p class="fst">I will offer at the outset a map of where I mean to go, since 
there will inevitably be certain detours, and the doubling back upon my own 
tracks. I shall direct my central attention to Althusser - and to the critical 
formative texts, <i>For Marx</i> and <i>Reading Capital</i> - and will not spend 
time over his numerous progeny It is true that many of these disown their 
master, and that others are influenced only in certain areas of their thought. 
But I hope that some of my general arguments (in particular on &#8216;empiricism&#8217; and 
&#8216;moralism&#8217;) may be taken to include them also. I apologise for this neglect; but 
life is too short to follow (for example) Hindess and Hirst to every one of 
their theoreticist lairs. Nor shall I take up the lists against a more 
formidable opponent, Poulantzas, who - with Althusser - repeatedly fails to 
understand the <i>historical</i> categories (of class, ideology, etc.) employed 
by Marx. Another time, perhaps. Let us stay now with the Aristotle of the new 
Marxist idealism.</p>

<p class="fst">I will argue the following propositions, and examine them in 
sequence. 1) Althusser&#8217;s epistemology is derivative from a limited kind of 
academic learning-process, and has no general validity; 2) As a result he has no 
category (or way of handling) &#8216;experience&#8217; (or social being&#8217;s impingement upon 
social consciousness); hence he falsifies the &#8216;dialogue&#8217; with empirical evidence 
inherent in knowledge-production, and in Marx's own practice, and thereby falls 
continually into modes of thought designated in the Marxist tradition as 
&#8216;idealist&#8217;; 3) In particular he confuses the necessary empirical dialogue with <i>
empiricism,</i> and consistently misrepresents (in the most naive ways) the 
practice of historical materialism (including Marx&#8217;s own practice); 4) The 
resultant critique of &#8216;historicism&#8217; is at certain points <i>identical</i> to the 
specifically anti-Marxist critique of historicism (as represented by Popper), 
although the authors derive from this opposite conclusions.</p>

<p class="fst">This argument will take us some way on our road. I will then 
propose: 5) Althusser&#8217;s structuralism is a structuralism of <i>stasis,</i> 
departing from Marx&#8217;s own historical method; 6) Hence Althusser&#8217;s conceptual 
universe has no adequate categories to explain contradiction or change - or 
class struggle; 7) These critical weaknesses explain why Althusser must be 
silent (or evasive) as to other important categories, among them &#8216;economic&#8217; and 
&#8216;needs&#8217;; 8) From which it follows that Althusser (and his progeny) find 
themselves unable to handle, except in the most abstract and theoretic way, 
questions of value, culture - and political theory.</p>

<p class="fst">When these elementary propositions have been established (or, as 
Althusser will have it, &#8216;proved&#8217;) we may then stand back from the whole 
elaborate and sophistical structure. We may even attempt another kind of 
&#8216;reading&#8217; of his words. And, if we are not exhausted, we may propose some 
questions of a different kind: how has this extraordinary fracture occurred in 
the Marxist tradition? How are we to understand Althusserian structuralism, not 
in its self-evaluation as &#8216;science&#8217;, but <i>as ideology?</i> What were the 
specific conditions for the genesis and maturation of this ideology and its 
rapid replication in the West? And what is the political significance of this 
unmeasured assault upon historical materialism?</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">iii</a></h3>

<p class="fst">I commence my argument at a manifest disadvantage. Few spectacles 
would be more ludicrous than that of an English historian - and, moreover, one 
manifestly self-incriminated of empirical practices - attempting to offer 
epistemological correction to a rigorous Parisian philosopher.</p>

<p class="fst">I can sense, as I stare at the paper before me, the shadowy faces 
of an expectant audience, scarcely able to conceal their rising mirth. I don&#8217;t 
intend to gratify them. I don&#8217;t understand Althusser&#8217;s propositions as to the 
relation between the &#8216;real world&#8217; and &#8216;knowledge&#8217;, and therefore I can&#8217;t expose 
myself in a discussion of them.</p>

<p class="fst">It&#8217;s true that I&#8217;ve <i>tried</i> to understand them. Throughout <i>
For Marx</i> the question as to how these &#8216;raw materials&#8217; from the real world 
arrive in the laboratory of theoretical practice (to be processed according to 
Generalities I, II and III) cries out for some answer. But the opportunity for 
disclosure is passed by. Turning to <i>Reading Capital</i> we learn, with rising 
excitement, that now, at last, an answer will be given. Instead, we are offered 
anti-climax. We first endure some tedium and more exasperation, as a ritual 
commination against &#8216;empiricism&#8217; is conducted; even a mind without philosophic 
rigour cannot overlook the fact that Althusser continually confuses and 
conflates the empirical mode (or techniques) of investigation with the quite 
different ideological formation, <i>empiricism</i>, and moreover, simplifies his 
own polemics by caricaturing even this &#8216;empiricism&#8217;, and ascribing to it, 
indiscriminately and erroneously, &#8216;essentialist&#8217; procedures of abstraction.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> 
But at length, after fifty pages, we arrive at - what?</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We can say, then, that the mechanism of production of the 
knowledge effect lies in the mechanism which underlies the action of the forms 
of order in the scientific discourse of the proof.&quot; (<i>R.C.</i> 67)</p>

<p class="fst">Thirty-three words. And then silence.</p>

<p class="fst">If I understand these words, then I find them disgraceful. For we 
have been led all this way only to be offered a re-statement, in new terms, of 
the original question. Knowledge effects arrive, in the form of &#8216;raw materials&#8217; 
(Generalities I, which are already artefacts of culture, with more or less 
ideological impurity), obediently as &#8216;the scientific discourse of the proof&#8217; 
demands. I must explain my objection: and, first, what my objection is <i>not.</i></p>

<p class="fst">I don&#8217;t object to the fact that Althusser offers no &#8216;guarantees&#8217; 
as to an identity between the &#8216;real&#8217; object and its conceptual representation. 
One would expect any such formal guarantee to be of doubtful efficacy: even a 
casual acquaintance with philosophy suggests that such guarantees have a short 
term of validity and contain many clauses in small print which exonerate the 
guarantor from liability. Nor do I object to the fact that Althusser has 
abandoned the weary ground of attempting to elucidate a one-to-one 
correspondence between this &#8216;real&#8217; material event or object and that 
perception/intuition/sense-impression/concept. It would, perhaps, have been more 
honest if he had frankly confessed that, in doing so, he was also abandoning 
certain of Lenin&#8217;s propositions in <i>Materialism and Empirio-Criticism -</i> 
but for the least syllable of Lenin he professes a religious awe.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> 
And he certainly might have confessed that, in shifting his ground, he was <i>
following</i> and not setting philosophical fashion.</p>

<p class="fst">In the old days (one supposes) when the philosopher, labouring by 
lamp-light in his study, came to this point in his argument, he set down his 
pen, and looked around for an object in the real world to interrogate. Very 
commonly that object was the nearest one to hand: his writing-table. &#8216;Table,&#8217; he 
said, &#8216;how do I know that you exist, and, if you do, how do I know that my 
concept, table, represents your real existence?&#8217; The table would look back 
without blinking, and interrogate the philosopher in its turn. It was an 
exacting exchange, and according to which one was the victor in the 
confrontation, the philosopher would inscribe himself as idealist or a 
materialist. Or so one must suppose from the frequency with which tables appear. 
Today the philosopher interrogates instead the word: a pre-given linguistic 
artefact, with an indistinct social genesis and <i>with a history.</i></p>

<p class="fst">And here I begin to find terms for my objection. It is, first, 
that Althusser interrogates this word (or this &#8216;raw material&#8217; or this &#8216;knowledge 
effect&#8217;) too briefly. It exists only to be worked up by theoretical practice 
(Generality II) to structural conceptualisation or concrete knowledge 
(Generality HI). Althusser is as curt with linguistics and with the sociology of 
knowledge as he is with history or anthropology. His raw material (object of 
knowledge) is an inert, pliant kind of stuff, with neither inertia nor energies 
of its own, awaiting passively its manufacture into knowledge. It may contain 
gross ideological impurities, to be sure, but these may be purged in the alembic 
of theoretical practice.</p>

<p class="fst">Second, this raw material appears to present itself for 
processing as discrete mental events (&#8216;facts&#8217;, <i>ideas refus</i>, commonplace 
concepts): and it also presents itself with discretion. Now I don&#8217;t wish to jest 
with the very serious difficulties encountered by philosophers in this critical 
epistemological area. Since every philosopher encounters them I must believe 
that these difficulties are indeed immense. And, at this level, I can hope to 
add nothing to their clarification. But a historian in the Marxist tradition is 
entitled to remind a Marxist philosopher that historians also are concerned, 
every day, in their practice, with the formation of, and with the tensions 
within, social consciousness. Our observation is rarely singular: this object of 
knowledge, this event, this elaborated concept. Our concern, more commonly, is 
with multiple evidences, whose inter-relationship is, indeed, an object of our 
enquiry. Or, if we isolate that singular evidence for particular scrutiny, that 
evidence does not stand compliantly like a table for interrogation: it stirs, in 
the medium of time, before our eyes. These stirrings, these events, if they are 
within &#8216;social being&#8217; seem often to impinge upon, thrust into, break against, 
existent social consciousness. They propose new problems, and, above all, they 
continually give rise to <i>experience -</i> a category which, however imperfect 
it may be, is indispensable to the historian, since it comprises the mental and 
emotional response, whether of an individual or of a social group, to many 
inter-related events or to many repetitions of the same kind of event.</p>

<p class="fst">It may perhaps be argued that experience is a very low level of 
mentation indeed: that it can produce no more than the grossest &#8216;common sense&#8217;, 
ideologically-contaminated &#8216;raw material&#8217;, scarcely qualifying to enter the 
laboratory of Generalities I. I don&#8217;t think that this is so; on the contrary, I 
consider that the supposition that this is so is a very characteristic delusion 
of intellectuals, who suppose that ordinary mortals are stupid. In my own view, 
the truth is more nuanced: experience is valid and effective but within 
determined limits: the farmer &quot;knows&#8217; his seasons, the sailor &#8216;knows&#8217; his seas, 
but both may remain mystified about kingship and cosmology.</p>

<p class="fst">But the point immediately before us is not the limits of 
experience, but the manner of its arrival or production. Experience arises 
spontaneously within social being, but it does not arise without thought; it 
arises because men and women (and not only philosophers) are rational, and they 
think about what is happening to themselves and their world. If we are to employ 
the (difficult) notion that social being determines social consciousness, how 
are we to suppose that this is so? It will surely not be supposed that &#8216;being&#8217; 
is here, as gross materiality from which all ideality has been abstracted, and 
that &#8216;consciousness&#8217; (as abstract ideality) is there?<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> 
For we cannot conceive of any form of social being independently of its 
organising concepts and expectations, nor could social being reproduce itself 
for a day without thought. What we mean is that changes take place within social 
being, which give rise to changed <i>experience</i>: and this experience is <i>
determining</i>, in the sense that it exerts pressures upon existent social 
consciousness, proposes new questions, and affords much of the material which 
the more elaborated intellectual exercises are about.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> 
Experience, one supposes, constitutes some part of the raw material which is 
offered up to the procedures of the scientific discourse of the proof. Indeed, 
some intellectual practitioners have suffered experiences themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">Experience, then, does not arrive obediently in the way that 
Althusser proposes. One suspects that some very etiolated notion of knowledge is 
here. He has offered to us less an epistemology which takes into account the 
actual formative motions of consciousness than a description of certain 
procedures of academic life. He has abandoned the lamp-lit study and broken off 
the dialogue with an exhausted table: he is now within the emplacements of the 
Ecole Normale Superieur. The data have arrived, obediently processed by 
graduates and research assistants at a rather low level of conceptual 
development (G I), they have been interrogated and sorted into categories by a 
rigorous seminar of aspirant professors (G II), and the G III is about to ascend 
the rostrum and propound the conclusions of concrete knowledge.</p>

<p class="fst">But outside the university precincts another kind of 
knowledge-production is going on all the time. I will agree that it is not 
always rigorous. I am not careless of intellectual values nor unaware of the 
difficulty of their attainment. But I must remind a Marxist philosopher that 
knowledges have been and still are formed outside the academic procedures. Nor 
have these been, in the test of practice, negligible. They have assisted men and 
women to till the fields, to construct houses, to support elaborate social 
organisations, and even, on occasion, to challenge effectively the conclusions 
of academic thought.</p>

<p class="fst">Nor is this all. Althusser&#8217;s account also leaves out the 
thrusting-forth of the &#8216;real world', spontaneously and not at all decorously, 
proposing hitherto unarticulated questions to philosophers. Experience does not 
wait discreetly outside their offices, waiting for the moment at which the 
discourse of the proof will summon it into attendance. Experience walks in 
without knocking at the door, and announces deaths, crises of subsistence, 
trench warfare, unemployment, inflation, genocide. People starve: their 
survivors think in new ways about the market. People are imprisoned: in prison 
they meditate in new ways about the law. In the face of such general experiences 
old conceptual systems may crumble and new problematics insist upon their 
presence. Such imperative presentation of knowledge effects is not allowed for 
in Althusser&#8217;s epistemology, which is that of a recipient - a manufacturer who 
is not concerned with the genesis of his raw material so long as it arrives to 
time.</p>

<p class="fst">What Althusser overlooks is the <i>dialogue</i> between social 
being and social consciousness. Obviously, this dialogue goes in both 
directions. If social being is not an inert table which cannot refute a 
philosopher with its legs, then neither is social consciousness a passive 
recipient of &#8216;reflections&#8217; of that table. Obviously, consciousness, whether as 
unselfconscious culture, or as myth, or as science, or law, or articulated 
ideology, thrusts back into being in its turn: as being is thought so thought 
also is lived - people may, within limits, <i>live</i> the social or sexual 
expectations which are imposed upon them by dominant conceptual categories.</p>

<p class="fst">It had been habitual among Marxists - indeed, it had once been 
thought to be a distinguishing methodological priority of Marxism - to stress 
the determining pressures of being upon consciousness; although in recent years 
much &#8216;Western Marxism&#8217; has tilted the dialogue heavily back towards ideological 
domination. This difficult question, which many of us have often addressed, may 
be left aside for the moment; it is in any case a question more usefully 
resolved by historical and cultural analysis than by theoretical pronouncements. 
If I have stressed the first party in the dialogue rather than the second, it is 
because Althusser has almost nothing to say about it - and refuses to attend to 
the accounts of historians or anthropologists who have. His silence here is both 
a guilty one and one necessary to his purpose. It is a consequence of his prior 
determination to wall up the least aperture through which &#8216;empiricism&#8217; might 
enter.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">iv</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Let us resume. Althusser's &#8216;epistemology&#8217; is founded upon an 
account of theoretical procedures which is at every point derivative not only 
from academic intellectual disciplines but from <i>one</i> (and at the most 
three) highly-specialised disciplines.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> 
The discipline is, of course, his own: philosophy: but of a particular Cartesian 
tradition of logical exegesis, marked at its origin by the pressures of Catholic 
theology, modified by the monism of Spinoza (whose influence saturates 
Althusser&#8217;s work<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a>), and marked 
at its conclusion by a particular Parisian dialogue between phenomenology, 
existentialism and Marxism. Thus the procedures from which an &#8216;epistemology&#8217; is 
derived are not those of &#8216;philosophy&#8217; in general, but of one particular moment 
of its presence. There is no reason why philosophers should necessarily identify 
their own procedures with those of every other kind of knowledge-production: and 
many have been at pains to make distinctions. It is an elementary confusion, a 
function of academic imperialism, and it is a tendency rather easy to correct. 
And it has been, very often, so corrected.</p>

<p class="fst">But not by Althusser. On the contrary, he makes a virtue of his 
own theoretical imperialism. The peculiarity of certain branches of philosophy 
and of mathematics is that these are, to an unusual degree, self-enclosed and 
self-replicating: logic and quantity examine their own materials, their own 
procedures. This Althusser offers as a paradigm of the very procedures of <i>
Theory:</i> G II (theoretical practice) works upon G I to produce G III. The 
potential &#8216;truth&#8217; of the materials in G I, despite all ideological impurities, 
is guaranteed by a hidden Spinozan monism (<i>idea vera debet cum suo ideato 
convenire):</i> a true idea must agree with its original in nature, or, in 
Althusserian terms, G I would not present itself if it did not correspond to the 
&#8216;real.&#8217; It is the business of the scientific procedures of G II to purify G I of 
ideological admixture, and to produce <i>knowledge</i> (G III), which, in its 
own theoretical consistency, contains its own guarantees (<i>veritas norma sui 
et falsi&#8212;</i> truth is the criterion both of itself and of falsehood). In a 
brief aside Althusser allows that G II may, in certain disciplines, follow 
somewhat different procedures: the discourse of the proof may even be conducted 
in the form of experiment. This is his only concession: Generality II (he 
admits) &#8216;deserves a much more serious examination than I can embark upon here.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> 
And so it does. For such an examination, if scrupulously conducted, would have 
exposed to view Althusser&#8217;s continuous, wilful and theoretically-crucial 
confusion between &#8216;empiricism&#8217; (that is, philosophical positivism and all its 
kin) and the empirical mode of intellectual practice.</p>

<p class="fst">This question lies close to the question of &#8216;historicism&#8217; (a 
matter in which I have my own declared interest), and so I cannot despatch it so 
quickly. Generalities I include those mental events which are generally called 
&#8216;facts&#8217; or &#8216;evidence.&#8217; &#8216;Contrary to the ideological illusions . . .-of 
empiricism or sensualism&#8217; (Althusser tells us) these &#8216;facts&#8217; are not singular or 
concrete: they are already &#8216;concepts ... of an ideological nature.&#8217; (<i>F.M.</i> 
183-4) The work of any science<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> 
consists in &#8216;<i>Elaborating its own scientific facts</i> through a critique of 
the <i>ideological &#8217;</i>&#8217;<i>facts&#8217;</i>&#8217; elaborated by an earlier ideological 
theoretical practice&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">To elaborate its own specific &#8216;facts&#8217; is simultaneously to 
elaborate its own &#8216;theory&#8217;, since a scientific fact - and not the self-styled 
pure phenomenon - can only be identified in the field of a theoretical practice. 
(<i>F.M.</i> 184)</p>

<p class="fst">This work of &#8216;<i>elaborating its own facts'</i> out of the raw 
material of pre-existent ideological concepts is done by Generality II, which is 
the working body of concepts and procedures of the discipline in question. That 
there are &#8216;difficulties&#8217; in the mode of operation of G II is acknowledged, but 
these difficulties are left unexamined (&#8216;we must rest content with these 
schematic gestures and not enter into the dialectic of this theoretical labour&#8217;. 
(<i>EM.</i> 185) )</p>

<p class="fst">This is wise, since the difficulties are substantial. One of them 
is this: how does knowledge ever change or advance? If the raw material, or the 
evidence (G I), which is presented to a science (G II) is already fixed within a 
given ideological field - and if G I is the <i>only</i> route (however shadowy) 
by which the world of material and social reality can affect an entry (a 
shame-faced, ideological entry) into the laboratories of Theory, then it is not 
possible to understand by what means G II can affect any relevant or realistic 
critique of the ideological impurities presented to it. In short, Althusser&#8217;s 
schema either show us how ideological illusions can reproduce themselves 
endlessly (or may evolve in aberrant or fortuitous ways); or it proposes (with 
Spinoza) that theoretical procedures <i>in themselves</i> can refine ideological 
impurities out of their given materials by no other means than the scientific 
discourse of the proof; or, finally, it proposes some ever-pre-given immanent 
Marxist Idea outside the material and social world (of which Idea this world is 
an &#8216;effect&#8217;). Althusser argues by turns the second and the third proposition, 
although his work is in fact a demonstration of the first.</p>

<p class="fst">But we may leave this difficulty aside, since it would be unkind 
to interrogate too strictly a Generality which has only been offered to us with 
&#8216;schematic gestures.&#8217; It is possible that Althusser is describing procedures 
appropriate to certain kinds of exercise in logic: we examine (let us say) a 
passage of text from Rousseau (G I): the uses of the words and the consistency 
of the logic is scrutinised according to rigorous philosophical or critical 
procedures (G II): and we arrive at a &#8216;knowledge&#8217; (G III), which may be a useful 
knowledge (and, within the terms of its own discipline, &#8216;true&#8217;), but which is 
critical rather than substantive. To confuse these procedures (appropriate 
within their own limits) with all procedures of knowledge production is the kind 
of elementary error which (one would suppose) could be committed only by 
students early in their careers, habituated to attending seminars in textual 
criticism of this kind, and apprentices rather than practitioners of their 
discipline. They have not yet arrived at those other (and equally difficult) 
procedures of research, experiment, and of the intellectual appropriation of the 
real world, without which the secondary (but important) critical procedures 
would have neither meaning nor existence.</p>

<p class="fst">In by far the greatest area of knowledge production a very 
different kind of dialogue is going on. It is untrue that the evidence or 
&#8216;facts&#8217; under investigation, always arrive (as G I) already in an ideological 
form. In the experimental sciences there are extremely elaborate procedures, 
appropriate to each discipline, intended to ensure that they do not (This is 
not, of course, to argue that scientific facts &#8216;disclose&#8217; their own &#8216;meanings&#8217; 
independently of conceptual organisation.) It is central to every other applied 
discipline (in the &#8216;social sciences&#8217; and &#8216;humanities&#8217;) that similar procedures 
are elaborated, although these are necessarily less exact and more subject to 
ideological determinations. The difference between a mature intellectual 
discipline and a merely-ideological formation (theology, astrology, some parts 
of bourgeois sociology and of orthodox Stalinist Marxism - and perhaps 
Althusserian structuralism) lies exactly in these procedures and controls; for, 
if the object of knowledge consisted only in ideological &#8216;facts&#8217; elaborated by 
that discipline&#8217;s own procedures, then there would never be any way of 
validating or of falsifying any proposition: there could be no scientific or 
disciplinary court of appeal.</p>

<p class="fst">The absurdity of Althusser consists in the idealist mode of his 
theoretical constructions. His thought is the child of economic determinism 
ravished by theoreticist idealism. It posits (but does not attempt to &#8216;prove&#8217; or 
&#8216;guarantee&#8217;) the existence of material reality: we will accept this point. It 
posits also the existence of a material (&#8216;external&#8217;) world of social reality, 
whose determinate organisation is always in the last instance &#8216;economic&#8217;: the 
proof for this lies not in Althusser&#8217;s work - nor would it be reasonable to ask 
for such proof in the work of a philosopher - but in the mature work of Marx. 
This work arrives ready-made at the commencement of Althusser&#8217;s enquiry, as a 
concrete knowledge, albeit a knowledge not always aware of its own theoretical 
practice. It is Althusser&#8217;s business to enhance its own self-knowledge, as well 
as to repel various hideous ideological impurities which have grown up within 
the silences of its interstices. Thus a given knowledge (Marx&#8217;s work) informs 
Althusser&#8217;s procedures at each of the three levels of his hierarchy: Marx&#8217;s work 
arrives as &#8216;raw material&#8217; - however elaborate - at G I; it is interrogated and 
processed (G II) according to principles of &#8216;science&#8217; derived from its mature <i>
aperfus,</i> unstated assumptions, implicit methodologies, etc.; and the outcome 
is to confirm and reinforce the concrete knowledge (G III) which approved 
portions of Marx&#8217;s work already announce.</p>

<p class="fst">It scarcely seems necessary to insist that this procedure is 
wholly self-confirming. It moves within the circle not only of its own 
problematic but of its own self-perpetuating and self-elaborating procedures. 
This is (in the eyes of Althusser and his followers) exactly the virtue of this 
theoretical practice. It is a sealed system within which concepts endlessly 
circulate, recognise and interrogate each other, and the intensity of its 
repetitious introversial life is mistaken for a &#8216;science.&#8217; This &#8216;science&#8217; is 
then projected back upon Marx&#8217;s work: it is proposed that his own procedures 
were of the same order: and that after the miracle of the &#8216;epistemological 
break&#8217; (an immaculate conception which required no gross empirical impregnation) 
all followed in terms of the elaboration of thought and its structural 
organisation.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;May I sum up all this in one sentence? This sentence 
describes a circle: a philosophic reading of <i>Capital</i> is only possible as 
the application of that which is the very object of our investigation, Marxist 
philosophy. This circle is only epistemologically possible because of the 
existence of Marx&#8217;s philosophy in the works of Marxism.&quot; (<i>R.C</i>. 34)</p>

<p class="fst">To facilitate the &#8216;discourse of the proof&#8217; we return to some 
passages of Marx, but now as raw material (G I): the hand is held over all 
Marx&#8217;s &#8216;immature&#8217; work, nearly all of the work of Engels, those portions of 
Marx&#8217;s mature work which exemplify the practice of historical materialism, the 
correspondence of Marx and Engels (which take us directly into their laboratory 
and show us their procedures), and the greater part of <i>Capital</i> itself 
(&#8216;illustrations&#8217;); but between the fingers of the hand one is allowed to peep at 
de-contexted phrases of Marx, at &#8216;silences&#8217;, and at sub-articulate mediations, 
which are chastised and disciplined until they confirm the self-sufficiency of 
theoretical practice. Of course. If the questions are proposed in this way, and 
if the material is called out - already drilled in its responses, and permitted 
to answer these questions and no others - then we can expect it to offer to the 
interrogator a dutiful allegiance.</p>

<p class="fst">This mode of thought is <i>exactly</i> what has commonly been 
designated, in the Marxist tradition, as idealism. Such idealism consists, not 
in the positing or denial of the primacy of an ulterior material world, but in a 
self-generating conceptual universe which imposes its own ideality upon the 
phenomena of material and social existence, rather than engaging in continual 
dialogue with these. If there is a &#8216;Marxism&#8217; of the contemporary world which 
Marx or Engels would have recognised instantly as an idealism, Althusserian 
structuralism is this.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> The 
category has attained to a primacy over its material referent; the conceptual 
structure hangs above and dominates social being.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">v</a></h3>

<p class="fst">I don&#8217;t propose to counter Althusser&#8217;s paradigm of 
knowledge-production with an alternative, universal, paradigm of my own. But I 
will follow him a little further into my own discipline. It is not easy to do 
this with an even temper, since his repeated references to history and to 
&#8216;historicism&#8217; display his theoretical imperialism in its most arrogant forms. 
His comments display throughout no acquaintance with, nor understanding of, 
historical procedures: that is, procedures which make of &#8216;history&#8217; a <i>
discipline</i> and not a babble of alternating ideological assertions: 
procedures which provide for their own relevant discourse of the proof.</p>

<p class="fst">However, let us be cool. Let us approach this problem, not from 
the suburbs (what historians <i>think</i> that they are doing when they consult 
and argue about &#8216;evidence&#8217;), but at the citadel itself: Althusser&#8217;s notion of 
Theory. If we can storm that aloof, castellated (and preposterous) imperial 
citadel, then we will save our energies from skirmishes in the surrounding 
terrain. The land will fall into our hand.</p>

<p class="fst">History (Althusser tells us) &#8216;hardly exists other than ... as the 
&#8216;application&#8217; of a theory . . . which does not exist in any real sense.&#8217; The 
&#8216;applications&#8217; of the theory of history somehow occur behind this absent 
theory&#8217;s back and are naturally mistaken for it.&#8217; This &#8216;absent theory&#8217; depends 
upon &#8216;more or less ideological outlines of theories&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We must take seriously <i>the fact that the theory of 
history, in the strong sense, does not exist</i>, or hardly exists so far as 
historians are concerned, that the concepts of existing history are therefore 
nearly always &#8216;empirical&#8217; concepts, more or less in search of their theoretical 
basis - &#8216;empirical&#8217; i.e. cross-bred with a powerful strain of an ideology 
concealed behind its &#8220;obviousness.&#8221; This is the case with the best historians, 
who can be distinguished from the rest precisely by their concern for theory, 
but who seek this theory at a level on which it cannot be found, at the level of 
historical <i>methodology</i>, which cannot be defined without the <i>theory</i> 
on which it is based.&quot; (<i>R.C.</i> 110)</p>

<p class="fst">We will pause for a moment to note one oddity. There has existed 
for fifty years or more (very much more if we remember Engels and Marx) a 
Marxist historiography, which, as I have already remarked, now has an 
international presence. It is curious, then, that all these historians (who 
might, one supposes, include one or two whom Althusser would nominate as among 
&#8216;the best&#8217;) have been operating through all these decades without any theory. 
For they had supposed that their theory was, exactly, derivative in some part 
from Marx: or from what Althusser would designate as Theory. That is, the 
critical concepts employed by these historians every day in their practice 
included those of exploitation, class struggle, class, determinism, ideology, 
and of feudalism and capitalism as modes of production, etc., etc., - concepts 
derived from and validated within a Marxist theoretical tradition.</p>

<p class="fst">So this is odd. Historians have no theory. Marxist historians 
have no theory either. Historical Theory, then, must be something different from 
Marxist historical theory.</p>

<p class="fst">But let us resume our survey of the citadel. We must climb crag 
after crag before we attain the summit. Theory cannot be found &#8216;at the level&#8217; of 
historical practice, whether Marxist or not. <i>Excelsior!</i></p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The truth of history cannot be read in its manifest 
discourse, because the text of history is not a text in which a voice (the 
Logos) speaks, but the inaudible and illegible notation of the effects of a 
structure of structures.&quot; (<i>R.C.</i> 17)</p>

<p class="fst">Not many historians suppose that the &#8216;manifest discourse&#8217; of 
history voluntarily discloses some &#8216;truth&#8217;, nor that the Logos is whispering in 
their ears. But even so, Althusser&#8217;s pat antithesis is somehow awry. &#8216;Inaudible 
and illegible&#8217;? Not wholly so. &#8216;Notation of the effects? Perhaps: as a metaphor 
we might let this pass: but is it not a metaphor which leads precisely to that 
notion of the abstraction of an essence &#8216;from the real which contains it and 
keeps it in hiding&#8217; which Althusser, in a different mood, castigates as the 
hall-mark of &#8216;empiricism&#8217;? (See <i>R.C.</i> 35-37) &#8216;Of the effects of a 
structure of structures&#8217;? Where, then, is this &#8216;structure of structures&#8217; 
situated, if it is subject to no &#8216;empirical&#8217; investigation and also (we recall) 
lies outside the &#8216;level&#8217; of historical methodology? If we may ask a vulgar 
question: is this &#8216;structure of structures&#8217; <i>there,</i> immersed in history&#8217;s 
happenings, or is it somewhere outside: for example, a Logos which speaks, not 
from the text of history, but out of some philosophical head?</p>

<p class="fst">The question is irrelevant, says Althusser: worse, it is 
improper: it is guilty: it arises from a bourgeois and empiricist problematic. 
To say that structure could be disclosed by procedures of historical 
investigation is meaningless because all that we can ever know of history are 
certain conceptual representations: impure Generalities I. Hence historical 
&#8216;truth&#8217; can be disclosed only within theory itself, by theoretical procedures 
(&#8216;the process that produces the concrete-knowledge takes place wholly in the 
theoretical practice&#8217;) (<i>EM.</i> 186). The formal rigour of these procedures 
is the only proof of the &#8216;truth&#8217; of this knowledge, and of its correspondence to 
&#8216;real&#8217; phenomena: concrete knowledge, thus established, carries with it all 
&#8216;guarantees&#8217; that are necessary - or that can ever be obtained. &#8216;History itself 
is not temporality, but an epistemological category designating the object of a 
certain science, historical materalism.&#8217;<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> 
&#8216;The knowledge of history is no more historical than the knowledge of sugar is 
sweet.&#8217; (<i>R.C.</i> 106)</p>

<p class="fst">This ultimate ascent to the citadel is defended by an idealist 
netting of assertions so densely-textured as to be almost impenetrable. We may 
construct our knowledge of history only &#8216;<i>within knowledge</i>, in the process 
of knowledge, not in the development of the real-concrete.&#8217; (<i>R.C.</i> 108) 
And, of course, since everything that we think takes place within thought and 
its symbols, codes and representations, this is a truism. What occasions 
surprise is that it was possible for a philosopher, in the late 1960s, to 
re-iterate such truisms, with such rhetorical fury, with such severe castigation 
of (always-unidentified) opponents, and with such an assumption of novelty. But 
the rhetoric and the postures of severity are not &#8216;innocent&#8217;: they are devices 
to carry the reader from such truisms to the very different proposition that 
knowledge emerges <i>wholly</i> within thought, by means of its own theoretical 
self-extrapolation. Thus in one elision it is possible to dismiss both the 
question of <i>experience</i> (how G I are presented to theory) and the question 
of specific procedures of investigation (experimental or other) which constitute 
that empirical &#8216;dialogue&#8217; which I will shortly consider. Thus Althusser:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Once they are truly constituted and developed,<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> 
[the sciences] have no need for verification from <i>external</i> practices to 
declare the knowledges they produce to be &#8220;true&quot;, i.e. to be <i>knowledges.</i> 
No mathematician in the world waits until physics has <i>verified</i> a theorem 
to declare it proved. . . The truth of his theorem is a hundred per cent 
provided by criteria purely <i>internal</i> to the practice of mathematical 
proof, hence by the <i>criterion of mathematical practice</i>, i.e. by the forms 
required by existing mathematical scientificity. We can say the same for the 
results of every science. . .&quot; (JR.C. 59)</p>

<p class="fst">Can we indeed? Once again, Althusser falls back upon a discipline 
which, insofar as it contemplates the logic of its own materials, is a special 
case: the notion that mathematics could serve as a paradigm, not only for logic, 
but for the production of knowledge, has haunted the Cartesian tradition, not 
least in the heretic thought of Spinoza. And Althusser goes on to declare, 
triumphantly:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We should say the same of the science which concerns us most 
particularly: historical materialism. It has been possible to apply Marx&#8217;s 
theory with success because it is &#8216;true&#8217;; it is not true because it has been 
applied with success.&quot; (<i>R.C.</i> 59)</p>

<p class="fst">The statement provides its own premise: <i>because</i> Marx&#8217;s 
theory is true (undemonstrated) it has been applied with success. True theories 
usually can be so applied. But how are we to determine this success? Within the 
historical discipline? And what about those occasions when Marx&#8217;s theories have 
been applied <i>without</i> success? If we were to propose this statement in 
this form: &#8216;It has been possible to apply Marx&#8217;s theory with success insofar as 
the theory has been &#8216;true&#8217;: where the theory has been successful it has 
confirmed the theory&#8217;s truth,&#8217; then we would find ourselves within a different 
epistemological discourse.</p>

<p class="fst">To resume. Althusser allows, in a perfunctory clause (this is 
evidently a matter at a very low level of theory indeed) that &#8216;no doubt there is 
a relation between <i>thought</i>-about-the-real and this <i>real</i>, but it is 
a relation of <i>knowledge</i>, a relation of adequacy or inadequacy of 
knowledge, not a real relation, meaning by this a relation inscribed in <i>that 
real</i> of which the thought is the (adequate or inadequate) knowledge&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;This knowledge relation between knowledge of the real and the 
real is not a relation <i>of the real</i> that is known in the relationship. The 
distinction between a relation of knowledge and a relation of the real is a 
fundamental one: if we did not respect it we should fall irreversibly into 
either speculative idealism if, with Hegel, we confused thought and the real by 
reducing the real to thought, by &#8216;conceiving the real as the result of thought . 
. . into empiricist idealism if we confused thought with the real by reducing 
thought about the real to the real itself.&quot; (JR. C. 87)</p>

<p class="fst">I do not pretend to understand this very well. It would not occur 
to me to define the relation between knowledge and its real object in terms of a 
&#8216;relationship&#8217; to which there were two <i>active</i> parties - the &#8216;real&#8217;, as it 
were, attempting actively to disclose itself to the recipient mind. The real, 
however active in its other manifestations, is epistemologically null or inert: 
that is, it can become an object of epistemological enquiry only at the point 
where it enters within the field of perception or knowledge. In Caudwell&#8217;s 
words, &#8216;object and subject, as exhibited by the mind relation, come into being 
simultaneously&#8217;, and &#8216;knowing is a mutually determining relation between knowing 
and being.&#8217;<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> There can be no 
means of deciding the &#8216;adequacy or inadequacy&#8217; of <i>knowledge</i> (as against 
the special cases of logic, mathematics, etc.) unless one supposes procedures (a 
&#8216;dialogue&#8217; of practice) devised to establish the correspondence of this 
knowledge to properties &#8216;inscribed in&#8217; that real.</p>

<p class="fst">Once again, Althusser has jumped from a truism to theoreticist 
solipsism. He has approached the problem with a commonplace assertion which 
presents no difficulties:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Thought about the real, the conception of the real, and all 
the operations of thought by which the real is thought or conceived, belong to 
the order of thought, the elements of thought, which must not be confused with 
the order of the real.&quot; (<i>R.C.</i> 87)</p>

<p class="fst">Where else could thought take place? But the &#8216;knowledge relation 
between knowledge of the real and the real&#8217; can still perfectly well be a real, 
and determining, relation: that is, a relation of the active appropriation by 
one party (thought) of the other party (selective attributes of the real), and 
this relation may take place <i>not on any terms which thought prescribes</i> 
but in ways which are determined by the properties of the real object: the 
properties of reality determine both the appropriate procedures of thought (that 
is, their &#8216;adequacy or inadequacy&#8217;) and its product. Herein consists the 
dialogue between consciousness and being.</p>

<p class="fst">I will give an illustration. . .and, aha! I see my table. To be 
an object, to be &#8216;null or inert&#8217;, does not remove that object from being a 
determining party within a subject-object relation. No piece of timber has ever 
been known to make itself into a table: no joiner has ever been known to make a 
table out of air, or sawdust. The joiner appropriates that timber, and, in 
working it up into a table, he is governed both by his skill (theoretical 
practice, itself arising from a <i>history</i>, or &#8216;experience&#8217;, of making 
tables, as well as a history of the evolution of appropriate tools) and by the 
qualities (size, grain, seasoning, etc.) of the timber itself. The wood imposes 
its properties and its &#8216;logic&#8217; upon the joiner as the joiner imposes his tools, 
skills and his ideal conception of tables upon the wood.</p>

<p class="fst">This illustration may tell us little about the relation between 
thought and its object, since thought is not a joiner, nor is it engaged in this 
kind of manufacturing process. But it may serve to emphasise one possible form 
of relation between an active subject and an &#8216;inert&#8217; object, wherein the object 
remains (within limits) determinant: the wood cannot determine <i>what</i> is 
made, nor whether it is made well or badly, but it can certainly determine what 
can <i>not</i> be made, the limits (size, strength, etc.) of what is made, and 
the skills and tools appropriate to the making. In such an equation &#8216;thought&#8217; 
(if it is &#8216;true&#8217;) can only represent what is appropriate to the determined 
properties of its real object, and must operate within this determined field. If 
it breaks free, then it becomes engaged in freakish speculative botching, and 
the self-extrapolation of a &#8216;knowledge&#8217; of tables out of pre-existent bigotry. 
Since this &#8216;knowledge&#8217; does not correspond to the reality of the wood, it will 
very soon demonstrate its own &#8216;adequacy or inadequacy'; as soon as we sit down 
at it, it is likely to collapse, spilling its whole load of elaborate 
epistemological sauces to the floor.</p>

<p class="fst">The real object (I have said) is epistemologically inert: that 
is, it cannot impose or disclose itself to knowledge: all that takes place 
within thought and its procedures. But this does not mean that it is inert in 
other ways: it need by no means be sociologically or ideologically inert. And, 
to cap all, the real is not &#8216;out there' and thought within the quiet 
lecture-theatre of our heads, &#8216;inside here.&#8217; Thought and being inhabit a single 
space, which space is ourselves. Even as we think we also hunger and hate, we 
sicken or we love, and consciousness is intermixed with being; even as we 
contemplate the &#8216;real&#8217; we experience our own palpable reality. So that the 
problems which the &#8216;raw materials&#8217; present to thought often consist exactly in 
their very active, indicative, intrusive qualities. For the dialogue between 
consciousness and being becomes increasingly complex - indeed, it attains at 
once to a different <i>order</i> of complexity, which presents a different <i>
order</i> of epistemological problems - when the critical consciousness is 
acting upon a raw material made up of its own kind of stuff: intellectual 
artefacts, social relationships, the historical event.</p>

<p class="fst">A historian - certainly a Marxist historian - should be well 
aware of this. That dead, inert text of his evidence is by no means &#8216;inaudible&#8217;; 
it has a deafening vitality of its own; voices clamour from the past, asserting 
their own meanings, appearing to disclose their own self-knowledge as knowledge. 
If we offer a commonplace &#8216;fact&#8217; - &#8216;King Zed died in 1100 A.D&#8217; - we are already 
offered a concept of kingship: the relations of domination and subordination, 
the functions and role of the office, the charisma and magical endowments 
attaching to that role, etc.; and we are presented with these not only as an 
object of investigation, a concept which performed certain functions in 
mediating relationships in a given society, with (perhaps) several conflicting 
notations of this concept endorsed by different social groups (the priests, the 
serving-girls) within that society - not only this, which the historian has to 
recover with difficulty, but also this evidence is received by the historian 
within a theoretical framework (the discipline of history, which itself has a 
history and a disputed present) which has refined the concept of kingship, from 
the study of many examples of kingship in very different societies, resulting in 
concepts of kingship very different from the immediacy, in power, in 
common-sense, or in myth, of those who actually witnessed King Zed die.</p>

<p class="fst">These difficulties are immense. But the difficulties are 
multiplied many times over when we are considering not one event or concept 
(kingship) but those events which most historians regard as central to their 
study: historical 'process&#8217;, the interrelationship between disparate phenomena 
(as economies and ideologies), causation. The relationship between thought and 
its object now becomes so exceedingly complex and mediated;</p>

<p class="fst">and, moreover, the resulting historical knowledge establishes 
relations between phenomena which could never be seen, felt or experienced by 
the actors in,these ways at the time, and it organises the findings according to 
concepts and within categories which were unknown to the women and men whose 
actions make up the object of study - all these difficulties are so immense that 
it becomes apparent that &#8216;real&#8217; history and historical knowledge are things 
totally distinct. And so of course they are. What else could they be? But does 
it thereby follow that we must cut down the bridge between them? May not the 
object (real history) still stand in an &#8216;objective&#8217; (empirically-verifiable) 
relationship to its knowledge, and a relationship which is (within limits) 
determinant?</p>

<p class="fst">In the face of the complexities of such a conclusion, a certain 
kind of rational mind (and, in particular, a rational mind innocent of practical 
knowledge of historical procedures, and impatient for an easy route to the 
Absolute) recoils. This recoil can take many forms. It is of interest (and it 
ought to be of interest to Marxists) that, at the initial stage of the recoil, 
both empiricism and Althusserian structuralism arrive at an identical 
repudiation of &#8216;historicism.&#8217; So far from Althusser&#8217;s positions being original, 
they signify a capitulation to decades of conventional academic criticism of 
historiography, whose outcome has sometimes been relativist (&#8216;history&#8217; as an 
expression of the preoccupations of the present), sometimes idealist and 
theoreticist, and sometimes one of extreme radical scepticism as to history&#8217;s 
epistemological credentials. One route may have been through Husserl and 
Heidegger: another through Hegel and Lukacs: another through a more &#8216;empirical&#8217; 
tradition of &#8216;Anglo-Saxon&#8217; linguistic philosophy: but all routes have led to a 
common terminus.</p>

<p class="fst">At the end of his working life it was possible for that 
formidable practitioner of historical materialism, Marc Bloch, to assume with 
robust confidence the objective and determinant character of his materials: &#8216;The 
past is, by definition, a datum which nothing in the future will change.'<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> 
By the 1960s no such confidence might be expressed in respectable intellectual 
company; it was possible for a gifted writer within the Marxist tradition to 
assume historical relativism as a commonplace:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;For the human sciences, the historical individuality is 
constructed by the choice of what is essential <i>for us,</i> i.e. in terms of 
our value-judgements. Thus, historical reality changes from epoch to epoch with 
modifications in the hierarchy of values.&#8221;<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The particular reasons proposed for history&#8217;s epistemological 
lack of credibility have been different: as have been the proferred solutions: 
but Oakeshott and Althusser, Lucien Goldmann and Raymond Aron, Popper and 
Hindess/Hirst have all been loitering in the same area with similar intent.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a></p>

<p class="fst">&#8216;History&#8217; had perhaps called down this revenge upon itself. I 
don't mean to deny that the nineteenth and twentieth centuries engendered 
authentic and sometimes monstrous &#8216;historicisms&#8217; (evolutionary, teleological, 
and essentialist notions of &#8216;history&#8217;s&#8217; self-motivation); nor to deny that this 
same historicism permeated some part of the Marxist tradition, in the notion of 
a <i>programmed</i> succession of historical &#8216;stages&#8217;, motored towards a 
pre-determined end by class struggle. All this merited severe correction. But 
the correction administered to historical materialism too often assumed its 
guilt without scrupulous enquiry into its practice; or, if examples of guilt 
were identified (often in the work of ideologues rather than in the mature 
practice of historians), it was then assumed that these invalidated the whole 
exercise, rather than calling in question the practitioner, or the maturity of 
historical knowledge. And if critics and philosophers (Collingwood apart) were 
rather generally guilty of this convenient elision, no-one has been more 
outrageous in his attribution of &#8216;historicism&#8217; to the practice of historical 
materialism than Althusser: from start to finish the practice of historians (and 
of Marxist historians) is assumed by him but not examined.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us return the scrutiny of criticism back upon the critics, 
and see how Althusser and Popper came to a common rejection of &#8216;historicism.&#8217; 
For Popper there is a very limited sense in which he will allow that certain 
&#8216;facts&#8217; of history are empirically verifiable. But once we step across a shadowy 
(but critical) border from discrete facts or particular evidences to questions 
of process, social formations and relationships, or causation, we instantly 
enter a realm in which we must either be guilty of &#8216;historicism&#8217; (which 
consists, for him, in part in attributing to history predictive laws, or in 
propounding &#8216;general interpretations', which arise from improper &#8216;holistic&#8217; 
categories imposed by the interpreting mind, which are empirically unverifiable, 
and which we smuggle into history ourselves) or we are avowedly offering an 
interpretation as a &#8216;point of view.&#8217; The discrete facts are in any case 
contaminated by their random or preselected provenance. Evidence about the past 
either survives in arbitrary ways or in ways which impose a particular 
presupposition on the historical investigator, and since -</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The so-called &#8216;sources&#8217;, of history only record such facts as 
appeared sufficiently interesting to record. . . the sources will, as a rule, 
contain only facts that fit in with a pre-conceived theory. And since no further 
facts are available, it will not, as a rule, be possible to test that or any 
other subsequent theory.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Most interpretations will be &#8216;circular in the sense that they 
must fit in with that interpretation which was used in the original selection of 
the facts.&#8217; Hence historical knowledge, in any large or general sense, is its 
own artefact. While Popper allows that an interpretation may be disproved, 
because it does not correspond with empirically-ascertainable discrete facts (an 
allowance which Althusser cannot make), by his criteria of proof - criteria 
derived from the natural sciences - we can go no further. The experimental proof 
of any interpretation is impossible: hence interpretation belongs to a category 
outside of historical knowledge (&#8216;point of view&#8217;); although each generation has 
a right, and even a &#8216;pressing need&#8217;, to offer its own interpretation or point of 
view as a contribution to its own self-understanding and self-evaluation.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> 
Thus Popper: we cannot know &#8216;history&#8217;, or at best we may know only discrete 
facts (and these ones which happen to have survived through their own or 
historical self-selection). Interpretation consists in the introduction of a 
point of view: this may be legitimate (on other grounds) but it does not 
constitute any true historical knowledge. Althusser sets out from much the same 
premise:<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> although the 
suggestion that we can know even discrete facts encounters his scorn, since no 
fact can attain to epistemological identity (or the significance of any meaning) 
until it is placed within a theoretical (or ideological) field: and the 
theoretical act is prior to and informs whatever is pretended as &#8216;empirical&#8217; 
investigation.</p>

<p class="fst">In Althusser&#8217;s schema, ideology (or Theory) take on the functions 
offered by Popper as interpretation or point of view. It is only in their 
conclusions that we find any marked disagreement. For Popper &#8216;there is no 
history of mankind, there is only an indefinite number of histories of all kinds 
of aspects of human life.&#8217; These histories are created by historians out of an 
&#8216;infinite subject matter&#8217; according to contemporary preoccupations. <a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">
[22]</a>The emphasis falls with the monotony of a steam-hammer upon the 
unknowability of any objective historical process and upon the dangers of 
&#8216;historicist&#8217; attribution. We must grope out way backwards in an empiricist 
dusk, making out the dim facts at our feet, piece-meal and one at a time. But 
where Popper sees danger Althusser sees a splendid opportunity, a conceptual 
space, a vacancy inviting his imperial occupation. Historical process is 
unknowable as a real object: historical knowledge is the product of theory: 
theory <i>invents</i> history, either as ideology or as Theory (&#8216;science&#8217;). The 
only trouble is (we remember) that &#8216;the theory of history, in the strong sense, 
does not exist.&#8217; But Althusser can provide this theory to historians. We have no 
need to grope in the dusk: we will leap, with one gigantic epistemological 
bound, from darkness to day.</p>

<p class="fst">We have already noted this astounding idealism. To be sure, 
idealism is something that Althusser is very stern, even prim, about. 
&#8216;Speculative idealism&#8217; (he tells us) confuses thought and the real by reducing 
the real to thought, and by &#8216;conceiving the real as the result of thought.&#8217; Now 
Althusser does not; in so many words, make this superfluous gesture. (To deny 
explicitly the prior existence of a material world might even call down upon him 
some curious looks from the leaders of the P.C.F.) As a dutiful &#8216;materialist&#8217;, 
Althusser asserts that the real <i>does</i> exist, somewhere out there:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;For us, the &#8216;real&#8217; is not a <i>theoretical slogan;</i> the 
real is the real object that exists independently of its knowledge - but which 
can only be defined by its knowledge. In this second, theoretical, relation, the 
real is identical to the means of knowing it. . .&quot; (F.M. 246)</p>

<p class="fst">And, just so, over 350 years ago, a philosopher arguing from an 
opposite brief, declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;For us, God is not a <i>theoretical slogan;</i> God is the 
First Cause who exists independently of our knowledge, etc.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">- or, to be more precise, &#8216;Certain it is that God worketh nothing 
in nature but by second causes.&#8217; The argument did not prevent Francis Bacon from 
being accused as a secret atheist, and Althusser should not be surprised at 
being accused of dissolving reality in an idealist fiction. For this pious and 
necessary gesture once made (as a kind of genetic <i>a priori</i>, an &#8216;in the 
last instance&#8217; proviso), the &#8216;real&#8217; is shuffled quickly off the scene. All that 
thought can know is thought - and pretty bad artefacts of thought at that, &#8216;for 
the mind of man is. . . like an enchanted glass, full of superstition and 
imposture, if it be not delivered and reduced.&#8217;<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> 
Theory must now set that right.</p>

<p class="fst">Althusser does not so much confuse thought and the real as, by 
asserting the unknowability of the real, he confiscates reality of its 
determinant properties, thus reducing the real to Theory. This Theory lay 
immanent, awaiting Marx&#8217;s epistemological break. And the knowledge then 
appropriated by Marx (although &#8216;revealed&#8217; would be a better word) was determined 
in no way by its object. Historians have entirely misread <i>Capital:</i></p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;They did not see that history features in <i>Capital</i> as 
an object of theory, not as a real object, as an &#8216;abstract&#8217; (conceptual) object 
and not as a real-concrete object; and that the chapters in which Marx applies 
the first stages of a historical treatment either to the struggles to shorten 
the working day, or to primitive capitalist accumulation refer to the theory of 
history as their principle, to the construction of the concept of history and of 
its &#8216;developed forms&#8217;, of which the economic theory of the capitalist mode of 
production constitutes one determinate &#8216;region&#8217;.&quot; (R.C. 117)</p>

<p class="fst">And again:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Despite appearances, Marx does not analyse any &#8216;concrete 
society&#8217;, not even England which he mentions constantly in Volume One, but the 
CAPITALIST MODE OF PRODUCTION and nothing else. . . We must not imagine that 
Marx is analysing the concrete situation in England when he discusses it. He 
only discusses it in order to &#8216;illustrate&#8217; his (abstract) theory of the 
capitalist mode of production.&quot; (L. &amp; P. 76)</p>

<p class="fst">Arrayed in this scarlet and furred gown of Theory, Althusser may 
now storm into every adjacent lecture-theatre, and, in the name of philosophy, 
denounce the incumbents and expropriate them of their poor defective disciplines 
which pretend to be knowledges. Before these disciplines may proceed at all, 
they must first sit before his rostrum and master his lessons:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In particular, the specialists who work in the domains of the 
&#8216;Human Sciences&#8217; and of the Social Sciences (a smaller domain), i.e. economists, 
historians, sociologists, social psychologists, psychologists, historians of art 
and literature, or religious and other ideologies - and even linguists and 
psycho-analysts, all these specialists ought to know that they cannot produce 
truly scientific knowledges in their specializations unless they recognize the 
indispensability of the theory Marx founded. For it is, in principle, the theory 
which &#8216;opens up&#8217; to scientific knowledge the &#8216;continent&#8217; in which they work, in 
which they have so far only produced a few preliminary knowledges (linguistics, 
psychoanalysis) or a few elements or rudiments of knowledge (the occasional 
chapter of history, sociology, or economics) or illusions pure and simple, 
illegitimately called knowledges.&quot; (L. &amp; P. 72)</p>

<p class="fst">No matter if the vassals in these continents or &#8216;smaller domains&#8217; 
had supposed themselves to be Marxists already: they were imposters, and should 
perhaps now pay a double tribute to the &#8216;theory which Marx founded&#8217; but which 
no-one, including (notably) Marx, understood before the annunciation of 
Althusser. As for my own poor, laborious, discipline of history, the 
expropriation of our petty principality (no doubt a very small domain indeed) is 
total:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We must once again purify our concept of the theory of 
history, and purify it radically, of any contamination by the obviousness of 
empirical history, since we know that this &#8216;empirical history&#8217; is merely the 
bare face of the empiricist ideology of history. . . We must grasp in all its 
rigour the absolute necessity of liberating the theory of history from any 
compromise with &#8216;empirical' temporality.&quot; (R.C. 105)</p>

<p class="fst">Above all, we must overthrow the &#8216;incredible power&#8217; of a 
prejudice</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Which is the basis for contemporary historicism and which 
would have us confuse the object of knowledge with the real object by 
attributing to the object of knowledge the same &#8216;qualities&#8217; as the real object 
of which it is the knowledge.&quot; (R.C. 106)</p>

<p class="fst">It is clear that Althusser and his regiment of assistants intend 
to impose punitive taxation on this petty (and now subjugated) domain of 
history, and to visit our sins upon the heads of our children down to the third 
generation.</p>

<p class="fst">One stands astounded in this inverted world of absurdity. And yet 
its magic transfixes those minds which stray within, unless they come in under 
arms and under the discipline of criticism. (&#8216;Common sense&#8217; will do them no 
good: every visitor is searched at the frontier and stripped of that.) Enchanted 
minds move through humourless, visionary fields, negotiate imaginary obstacles, 
slay mythical monsters (&#8216;humanism&#8217;, &#8216;moralism&#8217;), perform tribal rites with the 
rehearsal of approved texts. There is drama: the initiates feel that they have 
something to do (they are developing a &#8216;science&#8217;) as they discover fresh 
&#8216;silences&#8217; in Marx, and extrapolate further from the self-extrapolating reasons 
of Theory. And there is the greater drama of heretics and heresies, as pupils 
and disciples fall from the faith, as rival prophets arise, and as sub- and 
post-Althusserianisms and derivative structuralisms (linguistic and semiotic) 
multiply. Of course: for it is exactly in conditions when a theory (or <i>a 
theology</i>) is subject to no empirical controls that disputes about the 
placing of one term lead on to theoretical parturition: the parturition of 
intellectual parthenogenesis.</p>

<p class="fst">So that is where we are. One more astonishing aberrant spectacle 
is added to the phantasmagoria of our time. It is a bad time for the rational 
mind to live: for a rational mind in the Marxist tradition it is a time that 
cannot be endured. For the real world also gesticulates at reason with its own 
inversions. Obscene contradictions manifest themselves, jest, and then vanish; 
the known and the unknown change places; even as we examine them, categories 
dissolve and change into their opposites. In the West a bourgeois soul yearns 
for a &#8216;Marxism&#8217; to heal its own alienation; in the &#8216;Communist&#8217; world a 
proclaimed &#8216;socialist basis&#8217; gives rise to a &#8216;superstructure&#8217; of orthodox 
Christian faith, corrupt materialism, Slav nationalism and Solzhenitsyn. In that 
world &#8216;Marxism&#8217; performs the function of an &#8216;Ideological State Apparatus&#8217;, and 
Marxists are alienated, not in their self-identity, but in the contempt of the 
people. An old and arduous rational tradition breaks down into two parts: an 
arid academic scholasticism and a brutal pragmatism of power.</p>

<p class="fst">All this is not unprecedented. The world has gone through such 
changes of scene before. Such changes signal the solution (or by-passing) of 
some problems, the arrival of new problems, the death of old questions, the 
invisible presence of new and unstated questions all around us. &#8216;Experience&#8217; - 
the experience of Fascism, Stalinism, racism, and of the contradictory 
phenomenon of working-class &#8216;affluence&#8217; within sectors of capitalist economies - 
is breaking in and demanding that we reconstruct our categories. Once again we 
are witnessing &#8216;social being&#8217; determining &#8216;social consciousness&#8217;, as experience 
impinges and presses upon thought: but this time it is not bourgeois ideology 
but the &#8216;scientific&#8217; consciousness of Marxism which is breaking under the 
strain.</p>

<p class="fst">This is a time for reason to grit its teeth. As the world 
changes, we must learn to change our language and our terms. But we should never 
change these <i>without reason.</i></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h6">vi</a></h3>

<p class="fst">To reply to Althusser. I will deny myself the advantage of 
fighting this battle upon favourable terrain - that is, the terrain of Marx&#8217;s 
and Engels&#8217; own writings. While in a contest on these terms almost every 
skirmish could be won (for, repeatedly, Marx and Engels, in the most specific 
terms, infer the reality of both process and structure &#8216;inscribed in&#8217; history, 
affirm the objectivity of historical knowledge, and pillory &#8216;idealist&#8217; modes of 
thought identical to those of Althusser) I refuse to conduct the argument on 
this terrain for three reasons. First, while each skirmish might be won, the 
battle would remain undecided: all that the retreating dogma needs to do is to 
&#8216;read&#8217; Marx even more selectively, discover new silences, repudiate more texts.<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> 
Second, I have long ceased to be interested in the defence of Marxism as 
doctrine in this kind of way.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a> 
Third, although <i>I know these texts</i>, and perhaps even know how to &#8216;read&#8217; 
them in a different way to Althusser&#8217;s readings - that is, I know them as an 
apprentice and as a practitioner of historical materialism, have employed them 
in my practice for many years, have tested them, have been indebted to them, and 
have also, on occasion, discovered different kinds of &#8216;silence&#8217; or inadequacy in 
them - although all this is true, I think that the time has gone by for this 
kind of textual exegesis.</p>

<p class="fst">In this point, and in this point only, I may approach to some 
agreement with Althusser. For either of us to point to a congruity between our 
positions and a particular text of Marx can prove nothing as to the validity of 
the proposition in question: it can only confirm a congruity. In one hundred 
years the intellectual universe has changed, and even those propositions of Marx 
which require neither revision nor elucidation were defined in a particular 
context, and very often in antagonism to particular and now-forgotten opponents; 
and in our new context, and in the face of new and, perhaps, more subtle 
objections, these propositions must be thought through and stated once again. 
This is a familiar historical problem. Everything must be thought through once 
more: every term must sit for new examinations.</p>

<p class="fst">I must delay a little longer over some practical objections. 
While these present themselves instantly to any practising historian, a 
philosopher will no doubt find them trivial: they can be spirited off with an 
epistemological wand. But the objections should be mentioned. For the 
descriptions of historical procedures proposed by Popper or by Althusser do not 
correspond to what most historians <i>think</i> they are doing, or &#8216;find&#8217; 
themselves to be doing in practice. One finds that some philosophers (and more 
sociologists) have a theoretic, but uninformed, notion of what historical 
&#8216;sources&#8217; are. Thus one has little sense of self-recognition in the statement 
(Popper) that &#8216;the so-called &#8220;sources&#8221; of history only record such facts as 
appeared sufficiently interesting to record&#8217;; nor in the statement 
(Hindess/Hirst), &#8216;facts are never <i>given</i>; they are always produced.&#8217; 
Popper&#8217;s statement appears to direct attention to the <i>intentionality</i> of 
the historical actors: historical evidence comprises only those records which 
these actors <i>intended</i> to transmit to posterity, and hence imposes their 
intentions as a heuristic rule upon the historian. Hindess and Hirst, who 
acknowledge themselves to be, in their epistemology, true Althusserians 
(although more rigorous than their master), shift attention from the genesis of 
evidence to its appropriation (within a particular theoretical field) by the 
historian, who &#8216;produces&#8217; facts, out of something not &#8216;given&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst">Both statements are half-truths: which is to say, they are 
untrue. By far the greater part of historical evidence has survived for reasons 
quite unrelated to any intention of the actors to project an image of themselves 
to posterity: the records of administration, taxation, legislation, religious 
belief and practice, the accounts of temples or of monasteries, and the 
archaeological evidence of their sites. It may be true that the further back we 
press into the margins of recorded time, more of the evidence becomes subject to 
Popper&#8217;s attribution of intention. This is not, however, a property of the 
evidence which ancient historians and archaeologists have unaccountably 
overlooked. Indeed, when they consider the earliest Mayan glyphs or cuneiform 
inscriptions of ancient Babylonia, an important object of study is, precisely, 
the intentions of the recorders: and, through this, the recovery of their 
cosmology, their astrology and calendars, their exorcisms and charms - the 
&#8216;interests&#8217; of the recorders.</p>

<p class="fst">Intended evidence (evidence intentionally provided to posterity) 
may be studied, within the historical discipline, as objectively as unintended 
evidence (that is, the greater part of historical evidence which survives for 
reasons independent of the actors&#8217; intentions). In the first case, the 
intentions are themselves an object of enquiry; and in both cases historical 
&#8216;facts&#8217; are &#8216;produced&#8217;, by appropriate disciplines, from the evidential facts. 
But does the confession that, in this disciplined sense, historical facts are 
&#8216;produced&#8217; warrant the half-truth of Hindess and Hirst, that &#8216;facts are never <i>
given</i>&#8217;? If they were <i>not</i>, in some sense, given, then historical 
practice would take place in an empty workshop, manufacturing history (as 
Althusser and Hindess/Hirst would like to do) out of theoretical air. And the 
very <i>given-ness of facts,</i> the determinate properties which they present 
to the practitioner, constitutes one half of that dialogue which makes up the 
discipline of the historian.</p>

<p class="fst">Popper seems to see all historical evidence as the Chronicles of 
Kings. Little historical evidence is &#8216;recorded&#8217; in this self-conscious sense: 
and what there is may still be read in Blake&#8217;s &#8216;infernal&#8217; sense: that is, held 
upside-down and shaken, until it discloses what its authors assumed but did not 
intend to record - implicit assumptions and attributes inscribed within the 
text. Most written sources are of value with little reference to the &#8216;interest&#8217; 
which led to their being recorded. A marriage settlement between a landed scion 
and the daughter of an East India merchant in the eighteenth century may leave a 
substantial deposit in a record office, of protracted negotiations, legal deeds, 
property agreements, even (rarely) an exchange of love letters. The intention of 
none of the actors was to record interesting facts to some general posterity: it 
was to unite and to secure property in particular ways, and perhaps also to 
negotiate a human relationship. The historian will read these materials, and, in 
the light of the questions which he proposes, he may derive from them evidence 
as to property transactions, as to legal procedures, as to the mediations 
between landed and mercantile groups, as to particular familial structures and 
kinship ties, as to the institution of bourgeois marriage, or as to sexual 
attitudes - none of which evidence the actors intended to disclose, and some of 
which (perhaps) they might have been horrified to know would come to light.</p>

<p class="fst">It is the same again and again: <i>all the time.</i> People were 
taxed: the hearth-tax lists are appropriated, not by historians of taxation, but 
by historical demographers. People were tithed: the terriers are appropriated as 
evidence by agrarian historians. People were customary tenants or copy-holders: 
their tenures were enrolled and surrendered in the rolls of the manorial court: 
these essential sources are interrogated by historians again and again, not only 
in pursuit of new evidence but in a dialogue in which they propose new 
questions. So that it seems to a mere historian to be rubbish (as a matter of 
&#8216;fact&#8217;, I know that it <i>is</i> rubbish) to assert, with Popper, that &#8216;the 
sources will, as a rule, contain only facts that fit in with pre-conceived 
theory.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">That facts are <i>there</i>, inscribed in the historical record, 
with determinate properties, does not, of course, entail some notion that these 
facts disclose their meanings and relationships (historical knowledge) of 
themselves, and independently of theoretical procedures. Few empiricists would 
argue this: and certainly not Popper. But insofar as this notion survives, it 
survives at a level of methodology rather than theory: that is, if only the 
correct <i>method</i> can be designed, usually quantitative (positivism armed 
with a computer), then the facts will disclose their meanings independently of 
any rigorous conceptual exercise. I have argued with the stasis of this kind of 
&#8216;empiricist&#8217; position, for many years, in my own practice,<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> 
and I do not mean to argue it all again. Some small part of what Althusser has 
to say about &#8216;empiricism&#8217; (when conceived as ideology) is just;<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a> 
and it is the instant recognition of the obviousness of this justice - both its 
&#8216;common sense&#8217; and its general academic acceptability - which is the usual 
gate-of-entry for inexperienced readers, and which beckons them into the 
interior of his absurd syllogistic world.</p>

<p class="fst">Instead of rehearsing this old tale once more, let us put it in 
this way. A historian is entitled in his practice to make a provisional 
assumption of an epistemological character: that the evidence which he handles 
has a &#8216;real&#8217; (determinant) existence independent of its existence within the 
forms of thought, that this evidence is witness to a real historical process, 
and that this process (or some approximate understanding of it) is the object of 
historical knowledge. Without making such assumptions he cannot proceed: he must 
sit in a waiting-room outside the philosophy department all his life. To assume 
thus does not entail the assumption of a whole series of intellectually 
illiterate notions, such as that facts involuntarily disclose their own 
meanings, that answers are supplied independently of questions, etc. We are not 
talking about pre-history, even if, in some quarters, pre-history survives and 
even sits robed in chairs. Any serious historian knows that &#8216;facts&#8217; are liars, 
that they carry their own ideological loads, that open-faced, innocent questions 
may be a mask for exterior attributions, that even the most highly-sophisticated 
supposedly-neutral and empirical research techniques - techniques which would 
deliver to us &#8216;history&#8217; packaged and untouched by the human mind, through the 
automatic ingestion of the computer - may conceal the most vulgar ideological 
intrusions.<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a> So: this is known: 
we have been sucking our own eggs for as long as philosophers have been sucking 
theirs.</p>

<p class="fst">The historical evidence is there, in its primary form,<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> 
not to disclose its own meaning, but to be interrogated by minds trained in a 
discipline of attentive disbelief. The discrete facts may be interrogated in at 
least six very different ways: 1) Before any other interrogation can be 
commenced, their credentials <i>as</i> historical facts must be scrutinised: how 
were they recorded? for what purpose? can they be confirmed from adjacent 
evidence? And so on. This is the bread-and-butter of the trade; 2) At the level 
of their own appearance, or apparent self-disclosure, but within terms of a 
disciplined historical enquiry. Where the facts under interrogation are social 
or cultural phenomena, we will most often find that the enquiry adduces <i>
value-bearing evidence</i>, in which those very qualities of self-evaluation 
inherent in the phenomena (e.g. attitudes towards or within marriage) become the 
object of study; 3) As more or less inert, &#8216;neutral&#8217;, <i>value-free evidences</i> 
(indices of mortality, wage-series, etc.), which are then subjected to enquiry, 
in the light of the particular questions (demographic, economic, agrarian) 
proposed: such enquiries having their own appropriate procedures (e.g. 
statistical) designed to limit (although by no means always successfully) the 
intrusion of ideological attributions; 4) As <i>links in a linear series</i> of 
occurrences, or contingent events - that is, history &#8216;as it actually happened&#8217; 
(but as it can never be fully known) - in the construction of .a narrative 
account; such a reconstruction (however much it may be despised by philosophers, 
by sociologists, and by an increasing number of contemporary historians who have 
been frightened by the first two) being <i>an essential constituent of the 
historical discipline</i>, a pre-requisite and premise of all historical 
knowledge, the ground of any objective (as distinct from theoretic) notion of 
causation, and the indispensable preliminary to the construction of an analytic 
or structured account (which identifies structural and causative relations), 
even though in the course of such an analysis the primitive sequential narration 
will itself undergo radical transformation; 5)</p>

<p class="fst">As <i>links in a lateral series</i> of 
social/ideological/economic/political relations (as, for example - this contract 
is a special case of the general form of contracts at that time: such contracts 
were governed by these forms of law: they enforced these forms of obligation and 
subordination), enabling us thereby to recover or infer, from many instances, at 
least a provisional &#8216;section&#8217; of a given society in the past - its 
characteristic relations of power, domination, kinship, servitude, market 
relations, and the rest; 6) It may follow from this, if we press the point a 
little further, that even discrete facts may be interrogated for <i>
&#8216;structure-bearing&#8217; evidence.</i></p>

<p class="fst">This suggestion is more controversial. Many (perhaps most) 
practising historians would assent to my first five points: these ways of 
interrogating evidence belong to the discipline, and to its own &#8216;discourse of 
the proof.&#8217; A historical materialist may argue that the structural organisation 
of given societies may be inferred not only from larger evidences (to which we 
will, in time, come) but may be inferred, in some part, from certain kinds of 
seemingly discrete facts themselves. Thus a tenure exists as &#8216;fact&#8217; as some 
Latin formula inscribed upon a court roll: but what that tenure &#8216;meant&#8217; cannot 
be understood independently of an entire structure of tenurial occupancy and 
attendant law: that is, within a tenurial <i>system:</i> hence this &#8216;fact&#8217; - 
and, very certainly, a series of facts of the same order (for certain 
philosophers of history isolate &#8216;facts&#8217; for epistemological scrutiny and lay 
these on their seminar table for scrutiny one at a time, whereas historians are 
always handling facts in bunches and in series) - carries within it some &#8216;index&#8217; 
towards that system, or, at least, it should propose to the interrogator an 
indicative question. Similarly, a bill-of-exchange is an &#8216;index&#8217; towards a 
particular system of credit within which that bill may be negotiated.</p>

<p class="fst">The point has significance, not only in relation to Althusser&#8217;s 
notion that &#8216;structure&#8217; cannot possibly be &#8216;inscribed in&#8217; the real (that theory 
&#8216;produces&#8217; this history), but in relation to Popper&#8217;s nominalism, and 
&#8216;methodological individualism&#8217;, which regards all notions of collectivity and of 
structure as &#8216;holistic&#8217; fictions or as abstractions imposed by the observer. 
But, as MacIntyre has shown, &#8216;the army&#8217; is, in Popper&#8217;s sense, an abstract 
concept; &#8216;the soldier&#8217; is a concrete one, a discrete evidence which he will 
allow. And yet,</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;You cannot characterise an army by referring to the soldiers 
who belong to it. For to do that you have to identify them as soldiers; and to 
do that is already to bring in the concept of an army. For a soldier just is an 
individual who belongs to an army. Thus we see that the characterisation of 
individuals and of classes has to go together. Essentially these are not two 
separate tasks.&#8221;<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A nominalist, if he were sufficiently strict, would have to 
describe the copyhold entry and the bill-of-exchange as passages of writing upon 
vellum or paper: and he would be at a loss even to describe writing 
independently of the concept of language. It is the children of yesterday's 
nominalists who are now the pupils of Althusser.</p>

<p class="fst">We will leave it there. I have proposed certain ways of 
interrogating facts, and no doubt other disciplined and appropriate ways may be 
proposed. These ways have two common attributes: 1) they assume that the 
historian is engaged in some kind of encounter with an evidence which is not 
infinitely malleable or subject to arbitrary manipulation: that there is a real 
and significant sense in which the facts are &#8216;there&#8217;, and that they are 
determining, even though the questions which may be proposed are various, and 
will elucidate various replies; 2) they involve disciplined and thoughtful 
application, and a discipline developed precisely to detect any attempt at 
arbitrary manipulation: the facts will disclose nothing of their own accord, the 
historian must work hard to enable them to find &#8216;their own voices,&#8217; Not the 
historian's voice, please observe: <i>their own voices</i>, even if what they 
are able to &#8216;say&#8217; and some part of their vocabulary is determined by the 
questions which the historian proposes. They cannot &#8216;speak&#8217; until they have been 
&#8216;asked&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst">I have proposed in the foregoing argument certain &#8216;practical 
objections&#8217;, from appearances: i.e. what a historian thinks that he is doing, 
his self-knowledge of his own procedures. It suggests very different procedures 
from those gestured at by Popper. And Althusser would find in my account 
reprehensible capitulations to &#8216;empiricist ideology&#8217;. But I don&#8217;t intend to 
prolong this line of defence: it could be greatly extended, greatly elaborated, 
and we could enter more closely into the historian&#8217;s workshop. But to offer a 
defence would be to agree that a serious case has been made out which requires 
such defence. And this is not so. Neither Popper nor Althusser show any close 
acquaintance with the historian&#8217;s procedures; neither understands the nature of 
historical knowledge. Popper shows the greater curiosity, and therefore his 
objections deserve the courtesy of some reply;<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a> 
but his repeated confusions between procedures in the experimental sciences and 
in the historical discipline, and between the different kinds of knowledge which 
eventuate, defeat his enquiry.<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a> 
Althusser shows no curiosity at all. He does not like the product, historical 
knowledge, and his distaste is perhaps so great that it prevents any kind of 
nearer acquaintance. He knows that Theory could write better history.</p>

<p class="fst">&#8216;The knowledge of history is no more historical than the 
knowledge of sugar is sweet.&#8217; Thus Althusser. Let us tease this brave epigram a 
little. It compels assent in an inattentive mind because of its &#8216;obvious&#8217; common 
sense, indeed its banality: no knowledge can be the same thing as its object. 
How true! And we could set up an epistemological Mint, to coin epigrams of the 
same order. &#8216;The knowledge of the French Communist Party is no more Communist 
than the knowledge of water is wet.&#8217; (One could recommend this as a mental 
distraction during boring railway journeys). Even so, the terms of this banal 
epigram have been loaded to trick us into a false conclusion. In the first 
clause (&#8216;history. . .historical&#8217;) we are deliberately pitched into an ambiguity: 
for &#8216;historical&#8217; may mean appertaining to real historical events or evidence, or 
it may mean appertaining to the historical discipline (the knowledge of 
history). Althusser intends us - for a rigorous philosopher could not commit 
such a solecism in innocence - to confuse these two meanings. For if he had 
proposed the &#8216;historical knowledge no more appertains to history than sugary 
knowledge is sweet,&#8217; we would not at once recognise a revelation of truth. We 
would suspect (rightly) that we were being &#8216;got at&#8217; And we would then look more 
critically at the second clause. Why &#8216;sweet&#8217;? In what ways do &#8216;historical&#8217; and 
&#8216;sweet&#8217; stand in relation to each other which permits a logical analogy to be 
drawn? &#8216;Historical&#8217; is a generic definition: it defines very generally a common 
property of its object (appertaining to the past and not to the present or the 
future). &#8216;Sweet&#8217; isolates one property only, from a number of other properties 
which might propose themselves. Sugar has chemical properties and constitution, 
it looks brown or white, it is cubed or in powder, it weighs so much, and the 
price of it keeps going up. The property singled out by Althusser - sweetness - 
concerns, not knowledge, but sense-perception. Sugar <i>tastes</i> sweet, but 
no-one has ever tasted history, which would, perhaps, taste bitter. Hence these 
two clauses stand only in rhetorical or polemical relation to each other.</p>

<p class="fst">An honest balancing of the clauses would have given us this: &#8216;The 
knowledge of history is no more historical than the taste of sugar is sweet.&#8217; 
This would not have astounded innocent readers with Theory&#8217;s wisdom, nor have 
sent them running to consult Bachelard and Lacan. Or it could have been proposed 
in another form again: &#8216;The knowledge of history is no more historical than the 
knowledge of sugar is chemical.&#8217; This would have brought us closer to an 
analogy; but, then, it would not have served so well the purposes of the 
Althusserian trick. For we would reflect that the knowledge of history <i>is</i> 
historical (it pertains to the historical discipline) in just the same way as 
the knowledge of sugar <i>is</i> chemical (it finds its definition within 
chemical science).</p>

<p class="fst">What Althusser wishes us to receive from his epigram is this: 
&#8216;The knowledge of history has got no more to do with real history than the 
knowledge of sugar has got to do with real sugar.&#8217; We would then see that we 
have been offered no brave discovery, but either an epistemological truism 
(thought is not the same thing as its object) or else a proposition both of 
whose clauses are untrue and whose implications are even a little mad. But we 
are invited to enter the Althusserian theatre through many little verbal 
turnstiles of this kind: we &#8216;buy&#8217; these exalted propositions as our entry fee. 
All that we need exchange for them is a little of our reason. And once inside 
the theatre we find that there are no exits.</p>

<p class="fst">We might examine other corrupt propositions in the same way, but 
I will not expose my readers to the tedium. It is time to ask a more serious 
question: how is it that Althusser, the rational architect, constructed this 
theatre of the absurd? What problems was Althusser addressing, whose 
complexities led him into these agonies of self-mystification? An answer might 
be proposed at two different levels: ideological and theoretical. We leave 
aside, for the moment, the ideological enquiry. First, we will do him the 
justice of considering his ideas at their own self-evaluation: we will suppose 
that he arrived at irrationalism by procedures (however faulty) of reason.</p>

<p class="fst">We have seen that the central fracture which runs through 
Althusser&#8217;s thought is a confusion between empirical procedures, empirical 
controls, and something which he calls &#8216;empiricism.&#8217; This fracture invalidates 
not this or that part of his thought but his thought as a whole. His 
epistemological stance prevents him from understanding the two &#8216;dialogues&#8217; out 
of which our knowledge is formed: first, the dialogue between social being and 
social consciousness, which gives rise to experience; second, the dialogue 
between the theoretical organisation (in all its complexity) of evidence, on the 
one hand, and the determinate character of its object on the other. As a 
consequence of the second failure, he cannot understand (or must misrepresent) 
the character of those empirical procedures which are elaborated, within 
different disciplines, not only to interrogate &#8216;facts&#8217; but to ensure that they 
reply, not in the interrogator&#8217;s voice, but in their own voices. As a 
consequence of the first failure, he cannot understand either the real, 
existential genesis of ideology, or the ways in which human <i>praxis</i> 
contests this ideological imposition and presses against its bonds. Since he 
ignores both dialogues, he cannot understand neither how historical knowledge 
&#8216;arrives&#8217; (as experience) nor the procedures of investigation and verification 
of the historical discipline. The &#8216;epistemological break&#8217;, with Althusser, is a 
break <i>from</i> disciplined self-knowledge and a leap into the self-generation 
of &#8216;knowledge&#8217; according to its own theoretical procedures: that is, a leap out 
of knowledge and into theology.</p>

<p class="fst">He takes this leap because he cannot see any other way out of the 
compulsive ideological field of genuine empiricism, with its own intellectual 
complacency and its own self-confirming positivist techniques. &#8216;Positivism, with 
its narrowed view of rationality, its acceptance of physics as the paradigm of 
intellectual activity, its nominalism, its atomism, its lack of hospitality to 
all general views of the world&#8217;<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a> 
- this was not invented by Althusser. What he wishes to escape from - the 
self-enclosed, empiricist prison, whose methodologies patrol with (statistical, 
linguistic) keys at their belts, locking all doors against the admission of 
structured process - certainly exists. Althusser has scaled its walls; leapt; 
and now he constructs his own theatre on an adjacent site. Prison and theatre 
scowl at each other. But (a curious thing) both prison and theatre are built 
from much the same materials, even though the rival architects are sworn to 
enmity. Viewed from the aspect of historical materialism, the two structures 
exhibit an extraordinary identity. In certain lights the two structures appear 
to echo each other, merge into each other, exemplify the identity of opposites. 
For both are the products of conceptual stasis, erected, stone upon stone, from 
static, a-historical categories.</p>

<p class="fst">The critical question concerns less epistemology in its relation 
to discrete facts (although we have already noted certain similarities here) 
than the epistemological legitimacy of <i>historical</i> knowledge, when 
considered in its aspect as knowledge of causation, of structure, of the 
modalities of relationship between social groups or institutions, and of the 
logic (or laws&#8217;) of historical process. It is here that prison and theatre join 
common forces against historical materialism, for both assert this knowledge (as 
a knowledge of the real) to be epistemologically illegitimate. Althusser cannot 
bruise &#8216;empiricism&#8217; at all, because he starts out from the same premise: he 
merely &#8216;breaks&#8217; at a certain point to an idealist conclusion. Both Popper (a) 
and Althusser (b) affirm the unknowability of history as a process inscribed 
with its own causation, since (a) any notion of structures and structural 
mediations entails improper &#8216;holistic&#8217; attributions, and &#8216;historicist&#8217; notions 
of causation and of process are unverifiable by experimental tests; or since (b) 
the notion that knowledge is &#8216;already <i>really</i> present in the real object 
it has to know&#8217; is an illusion of &#8216;abstractionist&#8217; empiricism, mistaking as 
empirical discoveries its own ideological attributions, What does it matter that 
Althusser should <i>then</i> leap to the conclusion that knowledge does and 
should manufacture out of its own theoretical stuff a historical &#8216;knowledge&#8217; 
which is (in Popper&#8217;s use of the term) an arrant &#8216;historicism&#8217;? A real 
empiricist will be happy with this, for in his eyes Althusser has only 
confirmed, by his idealist agility, the unverifiable and ideological character 
of all such pretensions to historical knowledge. Althusser offers a prime 
example to the seminar discussion: an epilogue to <i>The Poverty of Historicism.</i></p>

<p class="fst">The objections to historical materialism which these antagonists 
hold in common are: &#8216;facts&#8217; (even if knowable) are discrete: they are as &#8216;raw 
material&#8217; impure: therefore (unstated but assumed) multiples of &#8216;facts&#8217; multiply 
impurities. Historical facts survive (as texts) in fortuitous or preselected 
ways: they arrive already within an ideological field (of a given society in the 
past, and in terms of its own self-evaluation); they are therefore in no way 
&#8216;neutral&#8217;. Historical notions of causation or of structure are highly-elaborated 
theoretical constructions; as such, they are the properties of theory and not of 
its object, &#8216;real&#8217; history. No empirical procedures can identify the category, 
social class; no experiment can be run through to prove the bourgeois character 
of bourgeois ideology, nor, indeed, to licence such a holistic notion. The 
vocabulary may be distinct, but the logics of both parties converge. At this 
point the philosophers shake hands, kiss each other&#8217;s cheeks, and part. The true 
empiricist then says: &#8216;The discrete facts are all that can be known. &#8220;History&#8221; 
is an improper holistic concept to cover a sequence of discrete facts as in fact 
they succeeded upon each other. If we introduce concepts, we introduce these as 
&#8220;models&#8221; which assist us to investigate and organise these facts; but we must be 
clear that these models exist in our heads and not &#8220;in&#8221; the history. And we must 
develop ever more refined, value-free, and preferably quantitative empirical 
techniques to enable these facts to disclose themselves as in fact they took 
place. Whatever happens, I will make sure that no facts escape from their 
discrete prison cells, enter into relationships, or hold mass meetings.&#8217; The 
exalted Marxist structuralist says: &#8216;Goodbye!</p>

<p class="fst">Your procedures bore me. I am going back to my theatre to write 
the script from some better, revolutionary, history.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">But the curious thing is that, walking off in opposite 
directions, they end up in much the same place. We will see how this occurs. The 
&#8216;sciences&#8217; (Althusser proposed), &#8216;have no need for verification from <i>external</i> 
practices to declare the knowledge they produce to be &#8220;true&#8217;.&#8217; And (we recall) 
he explicitly nominates historical materialism as one such science. &#8216;Marx&#8217;s 
theoretical practice is the criterion of the &#8220;truth&#8221; of the knowledges that Marx 
produced.&#8217; It is true that he once says in a rare gesture towards an 
extra-philosophical world, that the successes and failures of this theoretical 
knowledge &#8216;constitute pertinent &#8220;experiments&#8221; for the theory&#8217;s reflection on 
itself and its internal development.&#8217;<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a> 
The gesture is indistinct; the &#8220;experiments&#8221; are not identified; the criteria of 
success or failure go unspecified; the tone suggests that such &#8220;experiments&#8221; are 
pertinent but inessential; and there is no suggestion that they could determine, 
in any respect, the &#8216;internal development&#8217; of theory. So that, once again, we 
find a remarkable congruence between Althusser&#8217;s idealist structuralism and 
Popper&#8217;s &#8216;weak empiricism.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Our two philosophers have been walking on distinct, but parallel, 
paths, nodding to each other across the epistemologically-illiterate flower-beds 
of the historians. But now the paths converge once again. Popper&#8217;s radical 
scepticism has seemed to place us under the guidance of a vigilant logic; 
Althusser&#8217;s epistemology directs us to the rigours of theoretical practice; both 
seem to dignify theory or logic, and to place these above the illusory 
appearances of &#8216;objective reality.&#8217; But the consequence is that both meet, not 
at the fountain of thought, but staring with bewilderment into the gold-fish 
pond of appearances. Both paths of logic lead into the same bondage of things.</p>

<p class="fst">Popper disallows what cannot be sensed, tested by experiment, 
verified: but the inter-connections of social phenomena, causation within 
historical process - these seem to lie beyond any experimental test: hence a 
weak empiricism leaves us to stare uncomprehendingly at the world&#8217;s most 
immediate manifestations, accepting them as what they are because that is what 
they seem to be. Althusser, on the contrary, is nothing if not vigilant against 
&#8216;common sense&#8217; appearances. He suspects <i>every</i> manifestation, <i>every</i> 
&#8216;exterior&#8217; signal: theoretical practice is equipped with its own criteria and 
its own discourse of the proof. But what follows from this? Since theory has 
only internal means for its own self-verification, it could develop, by its own 
extrapolation, in whichever way it pleases. (And so, in some highly-theoreticist 
expressions, it does.) But we can&#8217;t in fact get through the business of life in 
this way, nor can we get through the business of thinking in any substantive 
manner or about any substantive question. Once we leave epistemology behind, and 
ask questions about our neighbours, or about the economy, or history, or 
political practice, then some kind of assumptions (as to what we are thinking <i>
about)</i> must be made before we can even begin to think.</p>

<p class="fst">Since theory disallows any active appropriation of the external 
world in the only way possible (by active engagement or dialogue with its 
evidence) then <i>this whole world must be assumed.</i> The &#8216;raw materials&#8217; (G 
I) which arrive are simply taken <i>as given;</i> and no amount of 
purely-internal processing by G II into G III can make silk purses out of these 
sows&#8217; ears; they remain (however mocked-up and sophisticated) exactly as they 
started off - as assumptions (prejudices, cursory &#8216;common sense&#8217; surveys of 
&#8216;what-everyone-knows&#8217;) which happen to fall conveniently to hand for the 
confirmation (&#8216;illustration&#8217;) of the prior propositions of the theory. It does 
not really matter that Popper and Althusser, bent in bewilderment over the same 
pond, see differently coloured fish: that bourgeois-empirical and 
Marxist-structural notions of &#8216;what-everyone-knows&#8217; are supported upon differing 
ulterior presuppositions. Both have immaculate epistemological reasons for 
seeing exactly what they came to see.</p>

<p class="fst">There in the pond the appearances swim: to Althusser the fish 
seem red, to Popper they are grey: one sees gorgeous Workers&#8217; State swim by, the 
other sees, lurking amidst the weeds, a reticent Open Society. They must both 
end with appearances since both commenced by denying that appearances are the 
inscription of an ulterior reality, of relationship and practices, whose 
significance can be disclosed only after arduous interrogation.</p>

<p class="fst">The appearances will not disclose this significance spontaneously 
and of themselves: does one need to say this yet again? It is not part of my 
intention to deny the seductive &#8216;self-evident&#8217; mystification of appearance, or 
to deny our own self-imprisonment within unexamined categories. If we suppose 
that the sun moves around the earth, this will be confirmed to us by 
&#8216;experience&#8217; every day. If we suppose that a ball rolls down a hill through its 
own innate energy and will, there is nothing in the appearance of the thing that 
will disabuse us. If we suppose that bad harvests and famine are caused by the 
visitation of God upon us for our sins, then we cannot escape from this concept 
by pointing to drought and late frosts and blight, for God could have visited us 
through these chosen instruments. We have to fracture old categories and to make 
new ones before we can &#8216;explain&#8217; the evidence that has always been there.</p>

<p class="fst">But the making and breaking of concepts, the propounding of new 
hypotheses, the reconstructing of categories, is not a matter of theoretical <i>
invention.</i> Anyone can do this. Perhaps the famine was some frolic of the 
devil? The blight in England a consequence of French witch-craft? Or perhaps it 
was in fulfilment of some ancient curse, consequent upon the Queen&#8217;s adultery? 
Appearance will confirm each one of these hypotheses as well: the devil is well 
known to be abroad, the French well known to be witches, and most queens to be 
adulterous. And if we suppose the Soviet Union to be a Workers&#8217; State guided by 
an enlightened Marxist theory; or that market forces within capitalist society 
will always maximise the common good; then in either case we may stand in one 
spot all day, watching the blazing socialist sun move across blue heavens, or 
the ball of the Gross National Product roll down the affluent hill, gathering 
new blessings on its way. We need not recite this alphabet once again.</p>

<p class="fst">This alphabet, however, is not some special code, understood only 
by logicians. It is a common alphabet, to be mastered at the entry to all 
disciplines. Nor is it a severe lesson, to be administered periodically to 
&#8216;empiricists&#8217; (and only to them). To be sure, there are such empiricists who 
require this correction. But the lesson has two edges to its blade. 
Self-generating hypotheses, subject to no empirical control, will deliver us 
into the bondage of contingency as swiftly - if not more swiftly - than will 
surrender to the &#8216;obvious&#8217; and manifest. Indeed, each error generates and 
reproduces the other; and both may often be found, contained within the same 
mind. What has, it seems, to be recited afresh is the arduous nature of the 
engagement between thought and its objective materials: the &#8216;dialogue&#8217; (whether 
as <i>praxis</i> or in more self-conscious intellectual disciplines) out of 
which all knowledge is won.</p>

<h3><a name="h7">vii</a></h3>

<p class="fst">There will now be a brief intermission. You may suppose that the 
lights have been turned up and the ushers are advancing with trays of ice-cream. 
During this intermission I intend to discuss historical logic. Philosophers or 
sociologists who have a dislike or a profound disbelief in this subject are 
advised to withdraw to the foyer and the bar. They may rejoin us at section 
viii.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not easy to discuss this theme. Not very long ago, when I 
was in Cambridge as a guest at a seminar of distinguished anthropologists, when 
I was asked to justify a proposition, I replied that it was validated by 
&#8216;historical logic.&#8217; My courteous hosts dissolved into undisguised laughter. I 
shared in the amusement, of course; but I was also led to reflect upon the 
&#8216;anthropological&#8217; significance of the exchange. For it is customary within the 
rituals of the academy for the practitioners of different disciplines to profess 
respect, not so much for the findings of each other&#8217;s discipline, as for the 
authentic credentials of that discipline itself. And if a seminar of historians 
were to laugh at a philosopher&#8217;s or anthropologist&#8217;s very <i>credentials,</i> 
(that is, the logic or discipline central to their practice) this would be 
regarded as an occasion for offence. And the significance of this exchange was 
that it was very generally supposed that &#8216;history&#8217; was an exception to this 
rule; that the discipline central to its practice was an occasion for laughter; 
and that, so far from taking offence, I, as a practitioner would join in the 
laughter myself.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not difficult to see how this comes about. The modes of 
historical writing are so diverse; the techniques employed by historians are so 
various; the themes of historical enquiry are so disparate; and, above all, the 
conclusions are so controversial and so sharply contested within the profession, 
that it is difficult to adduce any disciplinary coherence. And I can well see 
that there are things within the Cambridge School of History which might 
occasion anthropological, or other, laughter. Nevertheless, the study of history 
is a very ancient pursuit, and it would be surprising if, alone among the 
sciences and humanities, it had failed to develop its own discipline over 
several thousand years: that is, its own proper discourse of the proof. And I 
cannot see what this proper discourse is unless it takes the form of historical 
logic.</p>

<p class="fst">This is, I will argue, a <i>distinct</i> logic, appropriate to 
the historian&#8217;s materials. It cannot usefully be brought within the same 
criteria as those of physics, for the reasons adduced by Popper and many others: 
thus, &#8216;history&#8217; affords no laboratory for experimental verification, it affords 
evidence of necessary causes but never (in my view) of sufficient causes, the 
&#8216;laws&#8217; (or, as I prefer it, logic or pressures) of social and economic process 
are continually being broken into by contingencies in ways which would 
invalidate any rule in the experimental sciences, and so on. But these reasons 
are not objections to historical logic, nor do they enforce (as Popper supposes) 
the imputation of &#8216;historicism&#8217; upon any notion of history as the record of a 
unified process with its own &#8216;rationality.&#8217; They simply illustrate (and, on 
occasion, more helpfully, define) the conclusion that historical logic is not 
the same as the disciplinary procedures of physics.</p>

<p class="fst">Nor can historical logic be subjected to the same criteria as 
analytic logic, the philosopher&#8217;s discourse of the proof. The reasons for this 
lie, not in historians&#8217; lack of logic, as in their need for a different <i>kind</i> 
of logic, appropriate to phenomena which are always in movement, which evince - 
even in a single moment - contradictory manifestations, whose particular 
evidences can only find definition within particular contexts, and yet whose 
general terms of analysis (that is, the questions appropriate to the 
interrogation of the evidence) are rarely constant and are, more often, in 
transition alongside the motions of the historical event: as the object of 
enquiry changes so do the appropriate questions. As Sartre has commented: 
&#8216;History is not order. It is disorder: a rational disorder. At the very moment 
when it maintains order, i.e. structure, history is already on the way to 
undoing it&#8217;.<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But disorder of this kind is disruptive of any procedure of 
analytic logic, which must, as a first condition, handle unambiguous terms and 
hold them steadily in a single place. We have already noted a propensity in 
philosophers, when scrutinising &#8216;history&#8217;s&#8217; epistemological credentials, to 
place &#8216;facts&#8217; as isolates upon their table, instead of the historians&#8221; customary 
materials - the evidence of behaviour (including mental, cultural behaviour) 
eventuating through time. When Althusser and many others accuse historians of 
having &#8216;no theory&#8217;, they should reflect that what they take to be innocence or 
lethargy may be explicit and self-conscious <i>refusal:</i> a refusal of static 
analytic concepts, of a logic inappropriate to history. </p>

<p class="fst">By &#8216;historical logic&#8217; I mean a logical method of enquiry 
appropriate to historical materials, designed as far as possible to test 
hypotheses as to structure, causation, etc., and to eliminate self-confirming 
procedures (&#8216;instances&#8217;, &#8216;illustrations&#8217;). The disciplined historical discourse 
of the proof consists in a dialogue between concept and evidence, a dialogue 
conducted by successive hypotheses, on the one hand, and empirical research on 
the other. The interrogator is historical logic; the interrogative a hypothesis 
(for example, as to the way in which different phenomena acted upon each other); 
the respondent is the evidence, with its determinate properties. To name this 
logic is not, of course, to claim that it is always evidenced in every 
historian&#8217;s practice, or in any historian&#8217;s practice all of the time. (History 
is not, I think, unique in failing to maintain its own professions.) But it is 
to say that this logic does not disclose itself involuntarily; that the 
discipline requires arduous preparation; and that three thousand years of 
practice have taught us something. And it is to say that it is this logic which 
constitutes the discipline&#8217;s ultimate court of appeal: <i>not</i>, please note, 
&#8216;the evidence&#8217;, by itself, but the evidence interrogated thus.</p>

<p class="fst">To define this logic fully - and to reply to certain of Popper&#8217;s 
objections - would require writing a different, and more academic, essay, with 
many instances and illustrations. In addressing myself more particularly to the 
positions of Althusser it may be sufficient to offer, in defence of historical 
materialism, certain propositions.</p>

<p class="fst">1) The immediate object of historical knowledge (that is, the 
materials from which this knowledge is adduced) is comprised of &#8216;facts&#8217; or 
evidences which certainly have a real existence, but which are only knowable in 
ways which are and ought to be the concern of vigilant historical procedures. 
This proposition we have already discussed.</p>

<p class="fst">2) Historical knowledge is in its nature, a) provisional and 
incomplete (but not therefore untrue), b) selective (but not therefore untrue), 
c) limited and defined by the questions proposed to the evidence (and the 
concepts informing those questions) and hence only &#8216;true&#8217; within the field so 
defined. In these respects historical knowledge may depart from other paradigms 
of knowledge, when subjected to epistemological enquiry. In this sense I am 
ready to agree that the attempt to designate history as a &#8216;science&#8217; has always 
been unhelpful and confusing.<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a> 
If Marx and, even more, Engels sometimes fell into this error, then we may 
apologise, but we should not confuse the claim with their actual procedures. 
Marx certainly knew, also, that History was a Muse, and that the &#8216;humanities&#8217; 
construct knowledges.</p>

<p class="fst">3) Historical evidence has determinate properties. While any 
number of questions may be put to it, only certain questions will be 
appropriate. While any theory of historical process may be proposed, all 
theories are false which are not in conformity with the evidence&#8217;s 
determinations. Herein lies the disciplinary court of appeal. In this sense it 
is true (we may agree here with Popper) that while historical knowledge must 
always fall short of positive proof (of the kinds appropriate to experimental 
science), false historical knowledge is generally subject to disproof.<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a></p>

<p class="fst">4) It follows from these propositions that the relation between 
historical knowledge and its object cannot be understood in any terms which 
suppose one to be a function (inference from, disclosure, abstraction, 
attribution or &#8216;illustration&#8217;) of the other. Interrogative and response are 
mutually determining, and the relation can be understood only <i>as a dialogue.</i></p>

<p class="fst">Four further propositions may now be presented at somewhat 
greater length.</p>

<p class="fst">5) The object of historical knowledge is &#8216;real&#8217; history whose 
evidences must necessarily be incomplete and imperfect. To suppose that a 
&#8216;present&#8217;, by moving into a &#8216;past&#8217;, thereby changes its ontological status is to 
misunderstand both the past and the present.<a href="#n38" name="fn38" target="_self">[38]</a> 
The palpable reality of our own (already-passing) present can in no way be 
changed because it is, <i>already</i>, becoming the past for posterity. To be 
sure, posterity cannot interrogate it in all the same ways; to be sure, you and 
I, as experiencing instants and actors within our present, will survive only as 
certain evidences of our acts or thoughts.</p>

<p class="fst">While historians may take a decision to select from this 
evidence, and to write a history of discrete aspects of the whole (a biography, 
the history of an institution, a history of foxhunting, etc.), the real object 
remains unitary. The human past is not an aggregation of discrete histories but 
a unitary sum of human behaviour, each aspect of which was related in certain 
ways to others, just as the individual actors were related in certain ways (by 
the market, by relations of power and subordination, etc.). Insofar as these 
actions and relations gave rise to changes, which become the object of rational 
enquiry, we may define this sum as historical <i>process</i>: that is, <i>
practices</i> ordered and structured in rational ways. While this definition 
arrives in response to the question asked,<a href="#n39" name="fn39" target="_self">[39]</a> 
this does not &#8216;invent&#8217; process. We must take our stand here, against Goldmann, 
and with Bloch (see p. 26). The finished processes of historical change, with 
their intricate causation, actually occurred, and historiography may falsify or 
misunderstand, but can&#8217;t in the least degree modify the past&#8217;s ontological 
status. The objective of the historical discipline is the attainment of that 
history&#8217;s truth.</p>

<p class="fst">Each age, or each practitioner, may propose new questions to the 
historical evidence, or may bring new levels of evidence to light. In this sense 
&#8216;history' (when considered as the products of historical enquiry) will change, 
and ought to change, with the preoccupations of each generation, or, as it may 
be, each sex, each nation, each social class. But this by no means implies that 
the past events themselves change with each questioner, or that the evidence is 
indeterminate. Disagreements between historians may be of many kinds, but they 
remain as mere exchanges of attitude, or exercises of ideology, unless it is 
agreed that they are conducted within a common discipline whose pursuit is 
objective knowledge.</p>

<p class="fst">To this proposition it is necessary to add a rider. When we speak 
of the &#8216;intelligibility&#8217; of history, we may mean the understanding of the 
rationality (of causation, etc.) of historical process: this is an objective 
knowledge, disclosed in a dialogue with determinate evidence. But we may also 
imply the &#8216;significance&#8217; of that past, its meaning <i>to us</i>; this is an 
evaluative and subjective judgement, and to such interrogatives the evidence can 
supply no answers. This does not entail the conclusion that any such exercise is 
improper. We may agree (with Popper) that each generation, each historian, is 
entitled to express a &#8216;point of view&#8217;, or (with Kolakowski) that we are entitled 
to attribute such &#8216;immanent intelligibility&#8217; to history as an &#8216;act of faith&#8217;, 
provided that we are clear that this rests, not upon scientific procedures, but 
upon a &#8216;choice of values.&#8217;<a href="#n40" name="fn40" target="_self">[40]</a></p>

<p class="fst">We may agree not only that such judgements as to the &#8216;meaning&#8217; of 
history are a proper and important activity, a way in which today&#8217;s actors 
identify their values and their goals, but that it is also an <i>inevitable</i> 
activity. That is, the preoccupations of each generation, sex or class must 
inevitably have a normative content, which will find expression in the questions 
proposed to the evidence. But this in no way calls in question the objective 
determinacy of the evidence. It is simply a statement as to the complexity, not 
just of history, but of ourselves (who are simultaneously valuing and rational 
beings) - a complexity which enters into all forms of social self-knowledge, and 
which requires in all disciplines procedural safeguards. It is, exactly, within 
historical logic that such attributions of meaning, if covert and improper, are 
exposed; it is in this way that historians find each other out. A feminist 
historian will say, or ought to say, that this history-book is wrong, not 
because it was written by a man, but because the historian neglected contiguous 
evidence or proposed conceptually-inadequate questions: hence a masculine 
&#8216;meaning&#8217; or bias was imposed upon the answers. It is the same with the somewhat 
intemperate arguments which I and my Marxist colleagues often provoke within the 
academic profession. The appeal is not (or is rarely) to a choice of values, but 
to the logic of the discipline. And if we deny the determinate properties of the 
object, then no discipline remains.</p>

<p class="fst">But I cannot leave this rider while giving the impression that 
the attribution of &#8216;meaning&#8217;, as valued-significance, is only a matter for 
regret, a consequence of human fallibility. I think it to be greatly more 
important than that. I am not in the least embarrassed by the fact that, when 
presenting the results of my own historical research, I offer value judgements 
as to past process, whether openly and strenuously, or in the form of ironies or 
asides. This is proper, in one part, because the historian is examining 
individual lives and choices, and not only historical eventuation (process). And 
while we may not attribute value to process, the same objections do not arise 
with the same force when we are considering the choices of individuals, whose 
acts and intentions may certainly be judged (as they were judged by 
contemporaries) within the due and relevant historical context.</p>

<p class="fst">But this is only a special case of a more general question. Only 
we, who are now living, can give a &#8216;meaning&#8217; to the past. But that past has 
always been, among other things, the result of an argument about values. In 
recovering that process, in showing how causation actually eventuated, we must, 
insofar as the discipline can enforce, hold our own values in abeyance. But once 
this history has been recovered, we are at liberty to offer our judgement upon 
it.</p>

<p class="fst">Such judgement must itself be under historical controls. The 
judgement must be appropriate to the materials. It is pointless to complain that 
the bourgeoisie have not been communitarians, or that the Levellers did not 
introduce an anarcho-syndicalist society. What we may do, rather, is identify 
with certain values which past actors upheld, and reject others. We may give our 
vote for Winstanley and for Swift; we may vote against Walpole and Sir Edwin 
Chadwick.</p>

<p class="fst">Our vote will change nothing. And yet, in another sense, it may 
change everything. For we are saying that these values, and not those other 
values, are the ones which make this history meaningful <i>to us,</i> and that 
these are the values which we intend to enlarge and sustain in our own present. 
If we succeed, then we reach back into history and endow it with our own 
meanings: we shake Swift by the hand. We endorse in our present the values of 
Winstanley, and ensure that the low and ruthless kind of opportunism which 
distinguished the politics of Walpole is abhorred.</p>

<p class="fst">In the end we also will be dead, and our own lives will lie inert 
within the finished process, our intentions assimilated within a past event 
which we never intended. What we may hope is that the men and women of the 
future will reach back to us, will affirm and renew our meanings, and make our 
history intelligible within their own present tense. They alone will have the 
power to select from the many meanings offered by our quarrelling present, and 
to transmute some part of our process into their progress.</p>

<p class="fst">For &#8216;progress&#8217; is a concept either meaningless or worse, when 
imputed as an attribute <i>to</i> the past (and such attributions may properly 
be denounced as &#8216;historicist&#8217;), which can only acquire a meaning from a 
particular position in the present, a position of value in search of its own 
genealogy. Such genealogies <i>exist,</i> within the evidence: there have been 
men and women of honour, courage, and &#8216;foresight&#8217;, and there have been 
historical movements informed by these qualities. But in spite of Goldmann&#8217;s 
authority, we must argue, not that &#8216;historical reality changes from epoch to 
epoch with modifications in the hierarchy of values&#8217; but that the &#8216;meaning&#8217; 
which we attribute to that reality changes in this way.</p>

<p class="fst">This &#8216;rider&#8217; to my proposition has taken us a little out of our 
way. The proposition concerned the objectivity of &#8216;real' history. We seem to 
return, again and again, to the narrowing circuits of this epistemological 
whirlpool. Let us try to advance.</p>

<p class="fst">6) The investigation of history as process, as eventuation or 
&#8216;rational disorder&#8217;, entails notions of causation, of contradiction, of 
mediation, and of the systematic organisation (sometimes structuring) of social, 
political, economic and intellectual life. These elaborate notions<a href="#n41" name="fn41" target="_self">[41]</a> 
&#8216;belong&#8217; within historical theory, are refined within this theory&#8217;s procedures, 
are thought within thought. But it is untrue that they belong <i>only</i> within 
theory. Each notion, or concept, arises out of empirical engagements, and 
however abstract the procedures of its self-interrogation, it must then be 
brought back into an engagement with the determinate properties of the evidence, 
and argue its case before vigilant judges in history&#8217;s &#8216;court of appeal&#8217; It is, 
and in a most critical sense, a question of dialogue once more. In the sense 
that a thesis (the concept, or hypothesis) is brought into relation with its 
antithesis (atheoretical objective determinacy) and a synthesis (historical 
knowledge) results we might call this the dialectics of historical knowledge. Or 
we might have done so, before &#8216;dialectics&#8217; was rudely snatched out of our grasp 
and made into the plaything of scholasticism.</p>

<p class="fst">Historical practice is above all engaged in this kind of 
dialogue; with an argument between received, inadequate, or 
ideologically-informed concepts or hypotheses<a href="#n42" name="fn42" target="_self">[42]</a> 
on the one hand, and fresh or inconvenient evidence on the other; with the 
elaboration of new hypotheses; with the testing of these hypotheses against the 
evidence, which may involve interrogating existing evidence in new ways, or 
renewed research to confirm or disprove the new notions; with discarding those 
hypotheses which fail these tests, and refining or revising those which do, in 
the light of this engagement.</p>

<p class="fst">Insofar as a notion finds endorsement from the evidence, then one 
has every right to say that it <i>does</i> exist, &#8216;out there,&#8217; <i>in</i> the 
real history. It does not of course actually exist, like some plasma adhering to 
the facts, or as some invisible kernel within the shell of appearances. What we 
are saying is that the notion (concept, hypothesis as to causation) has been 
brought into a disciplined dialogue with the evidence, and it has been shown to 
&#8216;work&#8217;; that is, it has not been <i>dis</i>proved by contrary evidence, and that 
it successfully organises or &#8216;explains&#8217; hitherto inexplicable evidence; hence it 
is an adequate (although approximate) representation of the causative sequence, 
or rationality, of these events, and it conforms (within the logic of the 
historical discipline) with a process which did in fact eventuate in the past. 
Hence it exists simultaneously both as a &#8216;true&#8217; knowledge and as an adequate 
representation of an actual property of those events.</p>

<p class="fst">7) Historical materialism differs from other interpretive 
orderings of historical evidence not (or not necessarily) in any epistemological 
premises, but in its categories, its characteristic hypotheses and attendant 
procedures,<a href="#n43" name="fn43" target="_self">[43]</a> and in the avowed 
conceptual kinship between these and the concepts elaborated by Marxist 
practitioners in other disciplines. I do not see Marxist historiography as being 
attendant <i>on</i> some general corpus of Marxism-as-theory, located somewhere 
else (perhaps in philosophy?). On the contrary, if there is a common ground for 
all Marxist practices then it must be where Marx located it himself, in 
historical materialism. This is the ground from which all Marxist theory arises, 
and to which it must return in the end.</p>

<p class="fst">In saying this, I am not saying that Marxist historians are not 
indebted for certain concepts to a general Marxist theory which extends itself 
towards, and draws upon the findings of, Marxists at work in other fields. This 
is evidently the case; our work goes on in a continual exchange. I am disputing 
the notion that this is a Theory, which has some Home, independently of these 
practices: a self-validating textual Home, or a Home in the wisdom of some 
Marxist party, or a Home in purified theoretical practice. The homeland of 
Marxist theory remains where it has always been, the real human object, in all 
its manifestations (past and present): which object however, cannot be known in 
one theoretical <i>coup d&#8217;oeil</i> (as though Theory could swallow reality in 
one gulp) but only through discrete disciplines, informed by unitary concepts. 
These disciplines or practices meet at each other&#8217;s borders, exchange concepts, 
converse, correct each other&#8217;s errors. Philosophy may (and must) monitor, 
refine, and assist the conversation. But let philosophy attempt to <i>abstract</i> 
the concepts from the practices, and build from them a Home for Theory 
independently of these, and far removed from any dialogue with theory&#8217;s object, 
then we will have - the theatre of Althusser!</p>

<p class="fst">It follows that if Marxist concepts (that is, concepts developed 
by Marx and within the Marxist tradition) differ from other interpretive 
concepts in historical practice, and if they are found to be more &#8216;true&#8217;, or 
adequate to explanation, than others, this will be because they stand up better 
to the test of historical logic, and not because they are &#8216;derived from&#8217; a true 
Theory outside this discipline. As, in any case, they were not. Insofar as I am 
myself deeply indebted for certain concepts to Marx&#8217;s own practice, I refuse to 
evade responsibility by falling back upon his authority or to escape from 
criticism by leaping from the court of appeal. For historical knowledge, this 
court lies within the discipline of history and nowhere else.</p>

<p class="fst">Appeal may take two forms: a) evidential, which has been 
sufficiently discussed, and b) theoretical - to the coherence, adequacy and 
consistency of the concepts, and to their congruence with the knowledge of 
adjacent disciplines. But both forms of appeal may be conducted only within the 
vocabulary of historical logic. The court has been sitting in judgement upon 
historical materialism for one hundred years, and it is continually being 
adjourned. The adjournment is in effect a tribute to the robustness of the 
tradition; in that long interval the cases against a hundred other interpretive 
systems have been upheld, and the culprits have disappeared &#8216;downstairs&#8217;. That 
the court has not yet found decisively in favour of historical materialism is 
not only because of the ideological <i>parti pris</i> of certain of the judges 
(although there is plenty of that) but also because of the provisional nature of 
the explanatory concepts, the <i>actual</i> silences (or absent mediations) 
within them, the primitive and unreconstructed character of some of the 
categories, and the inconclusive determinacy of the evidence.</p>

<p class="fst">8) My final proposition brings a fundamental reservation to bear 
upon Althusserian epistemology, and also upon certain structuralisms or 
functional systems (e.g. Parsonian sociology) which periodically attempt to 
over-run the historical discipline. Certain critical categories and concepts 
employed by historical materialism can only be understood <i>as historical 
categories</i>: that is, as categories or concepts appropriate to the 
investigation of process, the scrutiny of &#8216;facts&#8217; which, even in the moment of 
interrogation, change their form (or retain their form but change their 
&#8216;meanings&#8217;), or dissolve into other facts; concepts appropriate to the handling 
of evidence not capable of static conceptual representation but only as 
manifestation or as contradiction.</p>

<p class="fst">The construction of historical concepts is not of course a 
special privilege peculiar to historical materialism. Such concepts arise within 
the historians&#8217; common discourse, or are developed within adjacent disciplines. 
The classic concept of the crisis of subsistence<a href="#n44" name="fn44" target="_self">[44]</a> 
proposes a rational sequence of events: as, for example, poor harvest dearth &#8212;» 
rising mortality &#8212;» the consumption of next year&#8217;s seed a second poor harvest &#8212;» 
extreme dearth &#8212;» a peak in mortality, accompanied by epidemic &#8212;» a sharply 
rising conception-rate. The concept of the familial development cycle proposes a 
particular three-generational sequence within the same peasant household, 
modified by the particular conditions of land tenure and inheritance practice. 
These concepts, which are generalised by logic from many examples, are brought 
to bear upon the evidence, not so much as &#8216;models&#8217; but rather as &#8216;expectations.&#8217; 
They do not impose a rule, but they hasten and facilitate the interrogation of 
the evidence, even though it is often found that each case departs, in this or 
that particular, from the rule. The evidence (and the real event) is not 
rule-governed, and yet it could not be understood without the rule, to which it 
offers its own irregularities. This provokes impatience in some philosophers 
(and even sociologists) who consider that a concept with such elasticity is not 
a true concept, and a rule is not a rule unless the evidence conforms to it, and 
stands to attention in one place.</p>

<p class="fst">Historical concepts and rules are often of this order. They 
display extreme elasticity and allow for great irregularity; the historian 
appears to be evading rigour as he disappears into the largest generalisations 
at one moment, while at the next moment he disappears into the particularities 
of the qualifications in any special case. This provokes distrust, and even 
laughter, within other disciplines. Historical materialism employs concepts of 
equal generality and elasticity - &#8216;exploitation&#8217;, &#8216;hegemony&#8217;, &#8216;class struggle&#8217; - 
and as expectations rather than as rules. And even categories which appear to 
offer less elasticity - &#8216;feudalism&#8217;, &#8216;capitalism&#8217;, &#8216;the bourgeoisie&#8217; - appear in 
historical practice, not as ideal types fulfilled in historical evolution, but 
as whole families of special cases, families which include adopted orphans and 
the children of typological miscegenation. History knows no regular verbs.</p>

<p class="fst">It is the misfortune of Marxist historians (it is certainly our 
special misfortune today) that certain of our concepts are common currency in a 
wider intellectual universe, are adopted in other disciplines, which impose 
their own logic upon them and reduce them to static, a-historical categories. No 
historical category has been more misunderstood, tormented, transfixed, and 
de-historicised than the category of social class;<a href="#n45" name="fn45" target="_self">[45]</a> 
a self-defining historical formation, which men and women make out of their own 
experience of struggle, of which men are not the makers but the vectors. Not 
only have Althusser and Poulantzas done Marxist history this wrong, but they 
then complain that history (from whose arms they abducted this concept) has no 
proper theory of class! What they, and many others, of every ideological hue, 
misunderstand is that it is not, and never has been, the business of history to 
make up this kind of inelastic theory. And if Marx himself had one supreme 
methodological priority it was, precisely, to destroy unhistorical 
theory-mongering of this kind.</p>

<p class="fst">History is not a factory for the manufacture of Grand Theory, 
like some Concorde of the global air; nor is it an assembly-line for the 
production of midget theories in series. Nor yet is it some gigantic 
experimental station in which theory of foreign manufacture can be &#8216;applied&#8217;, 
&#8216;tested&#8217;, and &#8216;confirmed.&#8217; That is not its business at all. Its business is to 
recover, to &#8216;explain&#8217;, and to &#8216;understand&#8217; its object: real history. The 
theories which historians adduce are directed to this objective, within the 
terms of historical logic, and there is no surgery which can transplant foreign 
theories, like unchanged organs, into other, static, conceptual logics, or <i>
vice versa.</i> Our objective is historical knowledge; our hypotheses are 
advanced to explain this particular social formation in the past, that 
particular sequence of causation.</p>

<p class="fst">Our knowledge (we hope) is not thereby imprisoned within that 
past. It helps us to know who we are, why we are here, what human possibilities 
have been disclosed, and as much as we can know of the logic and forms of social 
process. Some part of that knowledge may be theorised, less as rule than as 
expectation. And exchanges may and should take place with other knowledges and 
theories. But the exchange involves vigilance, as the theoretical coin of one 
discipline is translated into the currency of another. Philosophy ought not to 
stand on every frontier like a huckster, offering spurious &#8216;universal&#8217; 
bank-notes current in all lands. It might, instead, operate a watchful <i>bureau 
de change.</i></p>

<p class="fst">Those propositions of historical materialism which bear upon the 
relation between social being and social consciousness, upon the relations of 
production and their determinations, upon modes of exploitation, class struggle, 
ideology, or upon capitalist social and economic formations, are (at one pole of 
their &#8216;dialogue&#8217;) derived from the observation of historical eventuation <i>over 
time.</i> This observation is not of discrete facts <i>seriatim</i> but of <i>
sets</i> of facts with their own regularities: of the repetition of certain 
kinds of event: of the congruence of certain kinds of behaviour within differing 
contexts: in short, of the evidences of systematic social formations and of a 
common logic of process. Such historical theories as arise (not of themselves, 
but, at the other pole of the dialogue, by arduous conceptualisation) can not be 
tested, as is often supposed, by calling a halt to process, &#8216;freezing&#8217; history, 
and taking a static geological section, which will show capitalism or class 
hierarchies at any given moment of time as an elaborated structure.<a href="#n46" name="fn46" target="_self">[46]</a> 
In investigating history we are not flicking through a series of &#8216;stills&#8217;, each 
of which shows us a moment of social time transfixed into a single eternal pose: 
for each one of these &#8216;stills&#8217; is not only a moment of being but also a moment 
of becoming: and even within each seemingly-static section there will be found 
contradictions and liaisons, dominant and subordinate elements, declining or 
ascending energies. Any historical moment is both a result of prior process and 
an index towards the direction of its future flow.</p>

<p class="fst">There are well-known difficulties, both in explaining historical 
process and in verifying any explanation. &#8216;History&#8217; itself is the only possible 
laboratory for experiment, and our only experimental equipment is historical 
logic. If we press improper analogies with experimental sciences, we will soon 
find out that the whole business is unsatisfactory. History never affords the 
conditions for identical experiments; and while, by comparative procedures, we 
may observe somewhat similar experiments in different national laboratories (the 
rise of the nation state, industrialization) we can never reach back into those 
laboratories, impose our own conditions, and run the experiment through once 
again.</p>

<p class="fst">But such analogies have never been helpful. The fact that the 
difficulties of historical explanation are immense should surprise no-one. We 
inhabit the same element ourselves (a present becoming a past), a human element 
of habit, need, reason, will, illusion and desire, and we should know it to be 
made up of obstinate stuff. And yet there is one sense in which the past 
improves upon the present, for &#8216;history&#8217; remains its own laboratory of process 
and eventuation. A static section may show us certain elements (A, B &amp; C) in 
mutual interrelationship or contradiction; eventuation over time will show us 
how these relationships were lived through, fought out, resolved, and how ABC 
gave rise to D; and this eventuation will, in turn, throw light back upon the 
ways in which the elements were previously related and the strength of the 
contradiction.</p>

<p class="fst">In this sense the eventuation confirms or disproves, hardens or 
qualifies, the explanatory hypothesis. This is a bad laboratory in one sense: 
that the event took place in this way may be the consequence of some contingent 
element (X) overlooked in the explanation; thus ABC + X may have eventuated in 
one way (D), but ABC + Y would have eventuated differently (E); and to overlook 
this is to fall into the familiar error of arguing <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc.</i> 
This is a besetting problem of all historical explanation, and philosophers who 
have glanced at our procedures have made a hearty meal of it. But they overlook 
the fact that in another sense &#8216;history&#8217; is a good laboratory, because process, 
eventuation, is present within every moment of the evidence, testing every 
hypothesis in an outcome, providing results for every human experiment that has 
ever been conducted. Our logic is fallible. But the very multiplicity of 
experiments, and their congruence to each other, limit the dangers of error. The 
evidence as to any particular episode may be imperfect: there will be plenty of 
gaps when we consider eventuation in the form of discrete facts in series: but 
(at least in less distant history)<a href="#n47" name="fn47" target="_self">[47]</a> 
sufficient evidence survives to disclose the logic of this process, its outcome, 
the characteristic social formations, and how ABC in fact gave rise to D.</p>

<p class="fst">We may make this point more clear if we consider a problem, not 
from the past, but from the historical present. The Soviet Union is such a 
problem. In order to explain one aspect of this problem - who holds power and in 
what direction is political process tending? - a number of explanatory 
hypotheses are proposed. For example, the Soviet Union is a Workers&#8221; State 
(perhaps with certain &#8216;deformities&#8217;) capable of ascendant self-development, 
without any severe internal struggle or rupture of continuity: all 
&#8216;short-comings&#8217; are capable of self-correction, owing to the guidance of a 
proletarian party, informed by Marxist Theory, and hence blessed with the 
&#8216;know-how&#8217; of history. Or the Soviet Union is a state in which power has fallen 
into the hands of a new bureaucratic class, whose interest it is to secure its 
own privileges and continued tenure of power - a class which will only be 
overthrown by another proletarian revolution. Or the Soviet State is the 
instrument of a historically-specific form of forced industrialization, which 
has thrown up an arbitrary and contingent collocation of ruling-groups, which 
may now be expected to be the agents of the &#8216;modernization&#8217; of Soviet society, 
bringing it into tardy and imperfect conformity with that true model of modern 
man: the United States. Or (which is closer to my own view) the Soviet State can 
only be understood with the aid of the concept of &#8216;parasitism&#8217;, and whether or 
not its ruling groups harden into a bureaucratic <i>class</i>, or whether 
episodic reform can be imposed upon them by pressures of various kinds (from the 
needs and resistances of workers and farmers, from intellectual dissenters, and 
from the logic arising from their own inner contradictions, factional struggles, 
and incapacity to perform essential functions, etc.) remains, historically, an 
unfinished and indeterminate question, which may be precipitated into one or 
another more fully-determined direction by contingencies.</p>

<p class="fst">There is a real and important sense in which these (or other) 
hypotheses will only find confirmation or refutation in die <i>praxis</i> of 
eventuation. The experiment is still being run through, and (much as Althusser 
dislikes Engels&#8217;s Mancunian colloquialism) &#8216;the proof of the pudding will be in 
the eating.&#8217; The result, when brought within the scrutiny of future historians, 
may appear to confirm one hypothesis, or may propose a new hypothesis 
altogether. Any such &#8216;confirmation&#8217;, if it should arise, can never be more than 
approximate: history is not rule-governed, and it knows no sufficient causes: 
and if future historians suppose otherwise they would be falling into the error 
of <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc.</i> The hypotheses, or the blend of ideology 
and of self-knowledge, which we, or the Soviet people, adopt in this present 
will themselves enter as an element within eventuating process. And if some 
different &#8216;contingency&#8217; had impinged upon these elements (for example, if a 
Third World War had arisen from the Cuba crisis), then all would have eventuated 
differently, the military and security forces would have been immensely 
strengthened, and a different hypothesis might then appear to have explanatory 
force.</p>

<p class="fst">But this is not as devastating a qualification as may at first 
appear. For it will be <i>as</i> matters eventuate, <i>as</i> the &#8216;experiment' 
works out, which will afford to future historians immense additional insight as 
to the critical relations structuring Soviet society, which underlie the 
appearances of our historical present. The &#8216;result&#8217; will afford to them 
additional insight into which formidable elements (perhaps the State ideology of 
Marxism-Leninism) were to prove, in the event, to be fragile and in decline, and 
which inarticulate, loosely-structured elements pre-figured an emergent 
opposition. The historians of the future, who will know <i>how</i> things turned 
out will have a powerful aid to understanding, not why they <i>had</i> to turn 
out in that way, but why in fact they did: that is they will observe in the 
laboratory of events the evidence of determination, not in its sense as 
rule-governed law but in its sense of the &#8216;setting of limits&#8217; and the &#8216;exerting 
of pressures&#8217;<a href="#n48" name="fn48" target="_self">[48]</a> And today&#8217;s 
historians stand in exactly the same position in relation to the historical 
past, which is, simultaneously, the object of investigation and its own 
experimental laboratory.</p>

<p class="fst">That historical explanation cannot deal in absolutes and cannot 
adduce sufficient causes greatly irritates some simple and impatient souls. They 
suppose that, since historical explanation cannot be All, it is therefore 
Nothing; it is no more than a consecutive phenomenological narration. This is a 
silly mistake. For historical explanation discloses not how history <i>must</i> 
have eventuated but why it eventuated in this way and not in other ways; that 
process is not arbitrary but has its own regularity and rationality; that 
certain kinds of event (political, economic, cultural) have been related, not in 
any way one likes, but in particular ways and within determinate fields of 
possibility; that certain social formations are - not governed by &#8216;law&#8217; nor are 
they the &#8216;effects&#8217; of a static structural theorem - but are characterised by 
determinate relations and by a particular logic of process. And so on. And a 
great deal more. Our knowledge may not satisfy some philosophers, but it is 
enough to keep us occupied.</p>

<p class="fst">We have left our eighth proposition behind, and we may now 
rehearse it once again. The categories appropriate to the investigation of 
history are historical categories. Historical materialism is distinguished from 
other interpretive systems by its stubborn consistency (alas, a stubbornness 
which has sometimes been doctrinaire) in elaborating such categories, and by its 
articulation of these within a conceptual totality. This totality is not a 
finished theoretical &#8216;truth&#8217; (or Theory); but neither is it a make-belief 
&#8216;model&#8217;; it is a developing <i>knowledge</i>, albeit a provisional and 
approximate knowledge with many silences and impurities. The development of this 
knowledge takes place both within theory and within practice: it arises from a 
dialogue: and its discourse of the proof is conducted within the terms of 
historical logic. The actual operations of this logic do not appear, step by 
step, on every page of a historian&#8217;s work; if they did, history books would 
exhaust all patience. But this logic should be implicit in each empirical 
engagement, and explicit in the way in which the historian positions himself 
before the evidence and in the questions proposed. I do not claim that 
historical logic is always as rigorous or as self-conscious as it ought to be; 
nor that our practice often matches our professions. I claim only that there is 
such logic. And that not all of us are wet behind the ears.</p>

<p class="fst">The intermission is now over. Philosophers and sociologists are 
requested to cease chatting in the aisles, and to resume their places in the 
empty seats around me. The auditorium is darkening. A hush falls in the theatre. 
And Althusser resumes the stage.</p>

<p class="fst">The great impressario has returned refreshed, and in an 
uncustomary mood of geniality. He announces that the heavy epistemological drama 
will be suspended: we have done with history and tragedy for the time. Instead, 
he will present a burlesque sketch of his own composition, a little influenced 
by Sade. A superannuated clown with pretensions to epistemological 
respectability, will be brought in (the audience must please keep straight faces 
at first), quizzed, exposed, mocked, tormented, and finally booted and hooted 
off the stage. From the wings he drags on, gouty, dim-eyed, a fool&#8217;s cap upon 
his head, that poor old duffer, Frederick Engels.</p>

<p class="fst">The sketch starts a little slowly, and with subtlety. Engels is 
interrogated about 'parallelograms of forces&#8217;, about &#8216;individual wills&#8217; and 
historical &#8216;resultants&#8217;; he is convicted of tautology; he hangs his head; he is 
forgiven (&#8216;I am quite prepared to ignore Engels&#8217;s reference to <i>nature</i>&#8217;). 
He is convicted of worse confusion, of association with bourgeois ideology; he 
hangs his head again; is sharply reprimanded (a &#8216;futile construction&#8217;), but then 
is given a toffee (he has &#8216;genial theoretical intuitions&#8217;). He smiles and nods 
to the audience, little expecting what is to follow. The dialogue is a little 
difficult to follow, especially as the clown is not allowed to respond. We will 
take the script home and comment on it later.<a href="#n49" name="fn49" target="_self">[49]</a> 
Now the whip is brought on:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;When, in <i>Anti-Dühring</i>, Engels writes that &#8216;Political 
Economy is . . . essentially a historical science&#8217;, because &#8216;it deals with 
material which is historical, that is, constantly changing', he touches the 
exact spot of the ambiguity: the word '<i>historical</i>' may either fall 
towards the Marxist concept or towards the ideological concept of history, 
according to whether this word designates the <i>object of knowledge</i> of a 
theory of history, or, on the contrary, the real object of which this theory 
gives the knowledge. We have every right to say that the theory of Marxist 
political economy derives from the Marxist theory of history, as one of its 
regions; but we might also think [i.e. Engels&#8217;s words might allow us to suppose] 
that the theory of political economy is affected even in its concepts by the 
peculiar <i>quality</i> of real history (its &#8216;material&#8217; which is &#8216;<i>changing</i>&#8217;).&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The down &#8216;rushes us into this latter interpretation in a number 
of astonishing texts which introduce history (in the empiricist-ideological 
sense) even into Marx&#8217;s categories.&#8217; Absurdity of absurdities! He even says that 
it is wrong to expect &#8216;fixed, cut-to-measure once and for all applicable 
definitions in Marx&#8217;s works.&#8217; And he argues:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is self-evident that where things and their 
inter-relations are conceived, not as fixed, but as changing, their mental 
reflections, <i>the concepts are likewise subject to change and transformation.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Worse still, he is caught with his buttocks exposed, in an 
obscene anti-theoreticist posture:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;To <i>science definitions are worthless</i> because always 
inadequate. The only <i>real</i> definition is the <i>development</i> of the <i>
thing</i> itself, but <i>this is no longer a definition</i>.<a href="#n50" name="fn50" target="_self">[50]</a> 
To know and show all forms of life we must examine all forms of life and present 
them in their inter-connexion.&quot; (<i>R.C.</i> 113. Althusser&#8217;s exclamatory 
italics).</p>

<p class="fst">Thus the old buffer is exposed in an &#8216;astonishing&#8217; relapse into 
empiricist &#8216;ideology.&#8217; He is convicted of supposing that &#8216;the necessary concepts 
of any theory of history are affected in their conceptual substance, by the <i>
properties</i> of the <i>real</i> object&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In this way, Engels applies to the concepts of the theory of 
history a <i>coefficient of mobility</i> borrowed directly from the concrete 
empiricalsequence (from the ideology of history), transposing the 
&#8216;real-concrete&#8217; into the &#8216;thought-concrete&#8217; and the historical as real change 
into the concept itself.&quot; (<i>R.C</i>. 114)</p>

<p class="fst">But this time the old clown&#8217;s abject apologies earn him no 
remission of punishment. The boot and the whip fall inexorably. For it turns out 
that he is not a clown at all; he is a cunning fellow, masquerading in clown&#8217;s 
motley, hoping to pass off as jests the malice of his true nature. This nature 
is fully revealed at the very end of the act; for in March 1895, five months 
before his death, the old man sheds all disguises and is found writing to Conrad 
Schmidt:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The objections you raise to the law of value apply to <i>all</i> 
concepts, regarded from the standpoint of reality. The identity of thinking and 
being, to express myself in Hegelian fashion, everywhere coincides with your 
example of the circle and the polygon. Or the two of them, the concept of a 
thing and its reality, run side by side like two asymptotes, always approaching 
each other yet never meeting. <i>This difference between the two is the very 
difference which prevents the concept from being directly and immediately 
reality and reality from being immediately its own concept.</i> Because a 
concept has the essential nature of that concept and cannot therefore <i>prima 
facie</i> directly coincide with reality, from which it must first be 
abstracted, it is something more than a fiction, unless you are going to declare 
all the results of thought fictions because reality corresponds to them only 
very circuitously, and even when only with asymptomic approximation.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Now at last the sketch is brought to a close, the old man is 
booted whimpering into the wings, the curtain is rung down. Engels&#8217;s letter &#8216;is 
astounding (despite the banality of its obviousness)&#8217;. Engels&#8217;s blunders would 
mark &#8216;Marxist philosophical theory . . . and with what a mark! The mark of the 
empiricist theory of Knowledge . . .&#8217; On every side of me the audience bursts 
into rapturous applause.</p>

<p class="fst">What a clever sketch! It is a pity it was so brief, perhaps, 
because - now it has been shown to us - one can think of other earlier lines of 
this same clown which could have been turned to equal account. There was, for 
example, that malicious (decidedly not innocent) assault on philosophy itself, 
in <i>Ludwig Feuerbach</i>, which Althusser has no doubt not forgiven, and for 
which he is now taking his revenge. &#8216;The proof&#8217; of the Marxist conception of 
history (Engels unashamedly avowed) 'is to be found in history itself&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;This conception, however, puts an end to philosophy in the 
realm of history, just as the dialectical conception of nature made all natural 
philosophy both unnecessary and impossible. It is no longer a question anywhere 
of inventing interconnections from out of our brains, but of discovering them in 
the facts. For philosophy, which has been expelled from nature and history, 
there remains only the realm of pure thought (so far as it is left): the theory 
of the laws of the thought-process itself, logic and dialectics.&quot; (<i>L.F.</i> 
69)</p>

<p class="fst">What self-restraint in Althusser not to flagellate these notions 
(&#8216;discovering them in the facts'!!!): but the comedy would have been 
over-facile. Or there is that other &#8216;astonishing&#8217; text in <i>Anti-Dühring</i>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If we deduce world schematism not from our minds, but only <i>
through</i> our minds from the real world, deducing the basic principles of 
being from what is, we need no philosophy for this purpose, but positive 
knowledge of the world and of what happens in it; and what this yields is also 
not philosophy, but positive science.&quot; (<i>A-D,</i> 45)</p>

<p class="fst">(How does it happen that no record of Marx&#8217;s explosion before 
this apostasy has been recorded?) Or we could have browsed more generally 
through the old clown&#8217;s later letters. Even that letter to Schmidt, which 
Althusser has singled out for corrective treatment, does not end there; it <i>
goes on,</i> and, if anything, gets <i>worse!</i> All of Marx&#8217;s economic 
concepts - the general rate of profit, the law of wages, rent - indeed, 
&#8216;economic laws in general - none of them has any reality except as 
approximation, tendency, average, and not as <i>immediate</i> reality.&#8217; It is 
the same for historical concepts also:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Did feudalism ever correspond to its concept? Founded in the 
kingdom of the West Franks, further developed in Normandy by the Norwegian 
conquerors, its formation continued by the French Norsemen in England and 
Southern Italy, it came nearest to its concepts - in Jerusalem, in the kingdom 
of a day, which in the <i>Assises de Jerusalem</i> left behind it the 
most classic expression of the feudal order. Was this order therefore a fiction 
because it only achieved a short-lived existence in full classical form in 
Palestine, and even that mostly only - on paper?&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">And the same epistemological irresponsibility is displayed even 
with reference to the present, and <i>to the future!</i> For Engels tell&quot; 
Schmidt that the laws of value and of profit.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Both only attain their most complete approximate realisation 
on the pre-supposition that capitalist production has been everywhere 
established, society reduced to the modern classes of landowners, capitalists 
(industrialists and merchants) and workers - all intermediate stages, however, 
having been got rid of. This does not exist even in England and never will exist 
- we shall not let it get so far as that.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">What a solecism! To introduce into the discourse of the proof a 
category, &#8216;we' (the agency of an old man and his imaginary friends), derived 
from a different &#8216;region&#8217; (and a suspect region, too - does it smack of 
&#8216;humanism&#8217;?) and for which the Theory has made no provision!</p>

<p class="fst">But (for we are stern critics) the dramatist might surely have 
enriched his sketch in other ways? Why only <i>one</i> clown? Why not <i>two</i> 
clowns, a thin one stooping with age, and a fatter one, more robust and 
youthful, as foils to each other? Let us drag from the wings, perspiring, 
tormented by carbuncles, the super-clown, fatty Marx! He makes his bow, and 
recites from an early letter (to P.V. Annenkov, December 1846) (and <i>after</i> 
the &#8216;epistemological break&#8217;), a criticism of Proudhon:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;He has not perceived that <i>economic categories</i> are only 
the <i>abstract expressions</i> of these actual relations and only remain true 
while these relations exist. He therefore falls into the error of the bourgeois 
economists who regard these economic categories as eternal and not as historic 
laws which are only laws for a particular historical development. . . Instead, 
therefore, of regarding the political-economic categories as abstract 
expressions of the real, transitory, historic social relations, Monsieur 
Proudhon only sees, thanks to a mystic transposition, the real relations as 
embodiments of these abstractions. These abstractions therefore are formulae 
which have been slumbering in the heart of God the Father since the beginning of 
the world.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Categories, then, &#8216;are historic and transitory products,&#8217; 
whereas, according to Proudhon, &#8216;they, and not men, make history&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The <i>abstraction</i>, the <i>category taken as such</i>, 
i.e. apart from men and their material activities, is of course immortal, 
unmoved, unchangeable, it is only one form of the being of pure reason; which is 
only another way of saying that the abstraction as such is abstract. An 
admirable <i>tautology!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">And, writing to Schweitzer nearly twenty years later (January 
1865), Marx returned to the critique of Proudhon, in exactly the same terms: &#8216;he 
shares the illusions of speculative philosophy in his treatment of the <i>
economic categories;</i> for instead of conceiving them as <i>the theoretical 
expression of historic relations of production, corresponding to a particular 
stage of development in material production</i>, he garbles them into 
pre-existing <i>eternal ideas</i>. . .&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">But let us cease to imagine improvements in the sketch. Let us 
sit down and examine it as it has been presented.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h9">ix</a></h3>

<p class="fst">What is all this about? It would be simple to dismiss the whole 
argument on the grounds that Althusser has proposed a spurious question, 
necessitated by his prior epistemological confusions. This is, in fact, a large 
part of the answer, and a sufficient answer to Althusser, and it can be briefly 
stated. He has proposed a pseudo-opposition. On the one hand, he presents Theory 
(and <i>Capital</i> itself) as &#8216;occurring exclusively in knowledge and 
concerning exclusively the necessary order of appearance and disappearance of 
concepts in the discourse of the scientific proof.' (<i>R.C.</i> 114) On the 
other side, across from his rather grand project, he presents the petty projects 
of &#8216;empiricism', which constitute &#8216;ideology.&#8217; Engels is trying to muddle the 
two, which would be disastrous (the mark of the empiricist Beast!), since the 
discourse of the proof must, as a prerequisite, demand the fixity and 
unambiguity of concepts. But we have already seen that Althusser&#8217;s notion of 
&#8216;empiricism&#8217; is false, and that it imposes the canons of philosophy upon quite 
different procedures and disciplines. We need follow this argument no further.</p>

<p class="fst">Even within its own terms, Althusser&#8217;s argument offers 
self-contradictions and evasions. Thus he tells us that &#8216;we have every-right to 
say that the theory of Marxist political economy derives from the Marxist theory 
of history, as one of its regions&#8217;; but he also tells us (see p. 19) that the 
theory of history, even now, 100 years after <i>Capital</i>, &#8216;does not exist in 
any real sense.&#8217; So that in one of its &#8216;regions&#8217; Marxist political theory was 
derived from &#8216;an absent theory.&#8217; This goes along with the evasion of the evident 
fact that in <i>other</i> of its regions, this political economy was derived, 
very directly, from empirical engagement, either directly (from the mountain of 
blue books, etc., etc., to which Marx pays such generous tribute,<a href="#n51" name="fn51" target="_self">[51]</a>) 
or less directly, by intense and critical scrutiny of the empirically-based 
studies of other writers.</p>

<p class="fst">So that Althusser set out with a bad argument, and he rigged the 
terms to make it look better. Engels would appear to have been arguing two 
propositions. First, the inherently &#8216;approximate&#8217; nature of all our concepts, 
and especially of those necessarily &#8216;fixed&#8217; concepts which arise from and are 
brought to the analysis of changing, unfixed social development. This may be a 
&#8216;banality&#8217; in its &#8216;obviousness&#8217; to a philosopher, who supposes that it &#8216;is only 
another way of saying that the abstraction as such is abstract&#8217;, an &#8216;admirable <i>
tautology</i>&#8217; which rarely leaves Althusser&#8217;s lips. But, to a historian or an 
economist, it is (while &#8216;obvious&#8217; as theory) exceptionally complex in fact: it 
is an obviousness which can only too easily be forgotten in practice, and of 
which we need reminders.</p>

<p class="fst">Moreover, Engels is not just saying that concepts and their &#8216;real 
object&#8217; are different. It is true that he overstates his case in a moment of 
exasperation at the old bourgeois scholastics and the new &#8216;Marxist&#8217; schematists 
on every side: &#8216;to science definitions are worthless.&#8217; We understand his 
exasperation only too well. But the point of his letter to Schmidt is to argue, 
a) that because all concepts are approximations, this does not make them 
&#8216;fictions&#8217;, b) that only the concepts can enable us to &#8216;make sense of&#8217;, 
understand and know, objective reality, c) but that even in the act of knowing 
we can (and ought to) know that our concepts are more abstract and more logical 
than the diversity of that reality - and, by empirical observation, <i>we can 
know this too.</i> We cannot understand European medieval society without the 
concept of feudalism, even though, with the aid of this concept, we can also 
know that feudalism (in its conceptual logic) was never expressed &#8216;in full 
classical form&#8217;; which is another way of saying that feudalism is a heuristic 
concept which represents (corresponds to) real social formations, but, in the 
manner of all such concepts, does so in an overly purified and logical way. The 
definition cannot give us the real event. In any case, Engels&#8217;s words are 
clearer than my gloss. What they come back to, as so often in these last 
letters, is the cry for &#8216;dialectics&#8217;, whose true meaning is to be found less in 
his attempt to reduce these to a formal code than in his practice. And an 
important part of this practice is exactly that &#8216;dialogue&#8217; between concept and 
evidence which I have already discussed.</p>

<p class="fst">Engels&#8217;s second point concerns the nature of specifically <i>
historical</i> concepts, concepts adequate to the understanding of materials 
which are in continuous change. Althusser exclaims against the notion that &#8216;the 
theory of Political Economy is affected even in its concepts by the peculiar <i>
quality</i> of real history (its &#8216;material&#8217; which is &#8216;changing&#8217;).&#8217; The short 
answer to this is that if the real object of this knowledge is changing, and if 
the concepts cannot encompass the processes of change, then we will get 
extremely bad Political Economy. Not only Marxist but orthodox bourgeois 
Political Economy had an arsenal of such concepts of change (laws of this and 
that, rising and falling rates of the other, even the mobilities of supply and 
demand). What Althusser means to exclaim against is an irreverence to the fixity 
of categories. Engels says not only that the object changes but that the 
concepts <i>themselves</i> must be &#8216;subject to change and transformation.&#8217; For 
Althusser capitalism must be one thing: or another thing: or nothing. It cannot 
be one thing now, and another thing tomorrow. And if it is one thing, then the 
essential categories must remain the same, however much &#8216;play&#8217; there may be 
inside them. If the categories change as the object changes, according to a 
&#8216;coefficient of mobility&#8217;, then science or Theory are lost; we drift among the 
tides of phenomena, the tides themselves moving the rudder; we become (as Marx 
accused the students of Ranke) the &#8216;valets&#8217; of history.</p>

<p class="fst">But it is not clear that Engels has set us adrift like this. The 
offensive words (in my view) are not &#8216;concepts . . . are subject to change and 
transformation&#8217; (for that may well indicate, and <i>does</i> indicate for 
Engels, the strenuous theoretical-empirical dialogue entailed in 
transformation), but the preceding words, &#8216;their mental reflections,&#8217;<a href="#n52" name="fn52" target="_self">[52]</a> 
And Engels may equally be signalling - and, I think is, signalling in his 
discussion of the concept, feudalism - the particular flexibility of concepts 
appropriate in historical analysis: that is, the necessary generality and 
elasticity of historical categories, as expectations rather than as rules. I 
have had occasion enough to observe in my own practice that if a category as 
generous as &#8216;the working class&#8217; is improperly hardened by theoreticians to 
correspond to a particular historical moment of class presence (and an ideal 
moment at that), then it very soon gives false and disastrous 
historical/political results; and yet without the (elastic) category of class - 
an expectation justified by evidence - I could not have practised at all.</p>

<p class="fst">So that I think that Engels is talking good sense, that Althusser 
has misrepresented him, and is talking no sense at all. But, nevertheless, it is 
true that a real problem remains. We cannot just say that Engels is right and 
Althusser wrong. Althusser has misstated the problem, but at least we may admit 
that he has pointed to the area where the problem lies. The problem concerns, 
from one aspect, the differing modes of analysis of <i>structure</i> and of <i>
process</i>, And, from another aspect, the status of &#8216;Political Economy&#8217; and, 
hence, the status of <i>Capital.</i> We will take it from the second aspect 
first.</p>

<p class="fst">We must commence, at once, by agreeing that <i>Capital</i> is not 
a work of &#8216;history&#8217;. There is a history of the development of the forms of 
capital inscribed within it, but this is rarely developed within the historical 
discipline, or tested by the procedures of historical logic. The historical 
passages are something more than &#8216;instances&#8217; and &#8216;illustrations&#8217;, but something 
less than the real history. We will explain this more fully in a moment. But we 
must say at once that Marx never pretended, when writing <i>Capital</i>, that he 
was writing the history of capitalism. This is well known, but we will offer 
reminders. Marx hopes (as is apparent from the <i>Grundrisse</i> notebooks) that 
his work would &#8216;also offer the key to the understanding of the past - a work in 
its own right which, it is to be hoped, we shall be able to undertake as well.&#8217;<a href="#n53" name="fn53" target="_self">[53]</a> 
This hope was not fulfilled. The work which was completed was that described (to 
Lassalle in 1858) as &#8216;a critique of the economic categories or the system of 
bourgeois economy, critically presented'; and it dealt (he told Kugelmann) with 
&#8216;capital in general.&#8217; The first volume &#8216;contains what the English call &#8220;the 
principles of Political Economy&#8217;.&#8217; And its title was: <i>Capital</i>, <i>a 
Critique of Political Economy.</i><a href="#n54" name="fn54" target="_self">[54]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One way of proceeding may be to stand back from the structure for 
a moment, and enquire what kind of structure it is. First, we must note that 
some part of the power of the work comes not from its explicit procedures, and 
from its discourse of its object, but from choices as to values (and their 
vigorous and relevant expression) which could not possibly be deduced from the 
conceptual procedures themselves, and which are not the object of study. That 
is, Marx does not only lay bare the economic processes of exploitation, but he 
also expresses (or presents his material so as to evoke) indignation at 
suffering, poverty, child labour, waste of human potentialities, and contempt 
for intellectual mystifications and apologetics.</p>

<p class="fst">I comment on this, neither to commend it nor to condemn it, 
although the relevance may appear later. Since Marx&#8217;s choice of values could be 
justified only with reference to a &#8216;region&#8217; which Althusser curtly dismisses as 
&#8216;ideology&#8217;, we might have to explain (even condone) it as a vestige of bourgeois 
moralism, even humanism. Certainly, no such vestiges appear with Althusser and 
Balibar: when they have &#8216;read&#8217; <i>Capital</i> it has been disinfested of all 
this. We may, or we may not, prefer the first to the second &#8216;reading&#8217; of <i>
Capital</i>; the point is that, in this significant respect, they are different 
books.</p>

<p class="fst">Second, it may follow from this, and I think it <i>does</i> so 
follow, that if we disinfest <i>Capital</i> in this way of all &#8216;moralistic&#8217; 
intrusions, a very considerable part of that work - the major part - could be 
taken <i>just as</i> &#8216;what the English call &#8220;the principles of Political 
Economy&#8221;: an analytic critique of the existing &#8216;science&#8217;, and an exposition of 
an alternative &#8216;science&#8217;, of economic functions, relations, and laws. That is, 
if we did not (for exterior &#8216;reasons&#8217; of value) disapprove of exploitation, 
waste and suffering, then we would find ourselves presented with an alternative 
lawed structure of economic relations. To be true, the reader whose interests 
lay with &#8216;capital&#8217; would find its conclusions pessimistic; for the system is 
presented as moving rapidly towards a final crisis (which has not yet 
eventuated). But this could not afford any &#8216;scientific&#8217; reasons for 
disagreement.</p>

<p class="fst">These two considerations are not introduced for &#8216;moralistic&#8217; 
purposes. They help us to take a sighting of <i>Capital</i> within the 
intellectual context of its moment of genesis. And they remind us that the 
notions of <i>structure</i> and of <i>system</i> were not inventions of Marx 
(although one might suppose so from some contemporary statements). We had, as is 
well known, in eighteenth&quot; century Britain very marvellous structures, the 
admiration of the world and the envy of the French. In particular, the 
constitutional structures were exemplary, and had perhaps been provided to the 
British by God:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Britain&#8217;s matchless Constitution, mixt<br>
Of mutual checking and supporting Powers,<br>
Kings, Lords and Commons ...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Or, in the familiar clockwork analogy, as employed by William 
Blackstone: &#8216;Thus every branch of our civil polity supports and is supported, 
regulates and is regulated, by the rest . . . Like three distinct powers in 
mechanics, they jointly impel the machine of government in a direction different 
from what either, acting by itself, would have done . . .&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">God, as Bacon had pointed out, worked by second causes, and these 
causes, whether in nature, in psychology or in the constitution, often appeared 
as <i>sets</i> of interacting causes (structures). The sets that mechanical 
materialism proposed followed the paradigm of the clock, or of the mill. The 
constitutional set was governed by the rule of law. But bourgeois Political 
Economy (from Adam Smith forward) discovered a different set, seen now more as a 
&#8216;natural process&#8217;, whose nexus was the market, where intersecting self-interests 
were mediated, under the government of that market&#8217;s laws. By the time that Marx 
confronted it, this Political Economy had become, by way of Malthus, Ricardo, 
and the Utilitarians, a very sophisticated structure indeed, rigorous in its 
procedures and inclusive in its claims.</p>

<p class="fst">Marx identified this structure as his major antagonist, and he 
bent the whole energies of his mind to confounding it.<a href="#n55" name="fn55" target="_self">[55]</a> 
For nearly twenty years this was his major preoccupation. He had to enter into 
each one of the categories of Political Economy, fracture them, and re-structure 
them. We can see the evidences of these encounters in the <i>Grundrisse</i> 
notebooks of 1857-8, and it is customary to admire their exhaustive ardour. And 
I do so admire them. But I cannot altogether admire them. For they are evidences 
also that Marx was <i>caught in a trap</i>: the trap baited by &#8216;Political 
Economy.&#8217; Or, more accurately, he had been sucked into a theoretical whirlpool, 
and, however manfully he beats his arms and swims against the circulating 
currents, he slowly revolves around a vortex which threatens to engulf him. 
Value, capital, labour, money, value, reappear again and again, are 
interrogated, re-categorised, only to come round once more on the revolving 
currents in the same old forms, for the same interrogation.<a href="#n56" name="fn56" target="_self">[56]</a> 
Nor am I even able to agree that it <i>had</i> to be like this, that Marx&#8217;s 
thought could only have been developed in this way. When one considers the 
philosophical breakthrough of the 1840s, and the propositions which inform the <i>
German Ideology</i> and <i>Communist Manifesto</i>, there would appear to be 
indications of stasis, and even regression, in the next fifteen years. Despite 
the significance of the <i>economic</i> encounter in the <i>Grundrisse</i>, and 
despite the rich hypotheses which appear in its interstices (as to 
pre-capitalist formations, etc.), there is something in Marx&#8217;s encounter with 
Political Economy which is obsessive.</p>

<p class="fst">For what was this &#8216;Political Economy&#8217;? It did not offer a total 
account of society or of its history; or, if it pretended to do so, then its 
conclusions were entailed in its premises. These premises proposed that it was 
possible, not only to identify particular activities as &#8216;economic&#8217;, but to 
isolate these as a special field of study from the other activities (political, 
religious, legal, &#8216;moral&#8217; - as the area of norms and values was then defined - 
cultural, etc.); where such isolation proved to be impossible, as in the 
impingement of &#8216;politics&#8217; or &#8216;law&#8217; <i>upon</i> &#8216;economic&#8217; activity, then such 
impingement might be seen as improper interference with &#8216;natural&#8217; economic 
process, or as second-order problems, or as the fulfilment of economic goals by 
other means.</p>

<p class="fst">It might also be proposed (although not necessarily) that 
economics, and, with Malthus, demography, were first-order problems, and that 
these determined (or, in a &#8216;free&#8217; state, should and would determine) social 
development as a whole. These &#8216;underlay&#8217; the elaborate superstructures of 
civilization, determining the wealth of nations and the pace and direction of 
&#8216;progress.&#8217; Thus isolated, economic activities became the object of a &#8216;science&#8217;, 
whose primary postulates were interests and needs: self-interest at a 
micro-level, the interests of groups (&#8216;agriculture&#8217; and &#8216;industry&#8217;) or even of 
classes (&#8216;Labour&#8217; and &#8216;Capital&#8217;) at a macro-level, the groups and classes being 
defined according to the economic premises of the science. To develop such a 
science with rigor demanded accurate definition and fixity of categories, a 
mathematical logic, and the continuous internal circulation and recognition of 
its own concepts: its conclusions were acclaimed as &#8216;laws&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst">This is the structure of &#8216;Political Economy.&#8217; From the outside, 
in the 1840s, it appeared to Marx as ideology, or, worse, apologetics. He 
entered within it in order to overthrow it. But, once inside, however many of 
its categories he fractured (and how many times), the structure remained. For 
the premises supposed that it was possible to isolate economic activities in 
this way, and to develop these as a first-order science of <i>society.</i> It is 
more accurate to say that Marx, at the time of the <i>Grundrisse</i>, did not so 
much remain within the structure of &#8216;Political Economy&#8217; as develop an aw 
restructure, but within its same premises. The postulates ceased to be the 
self-interest of men and became the logic and forms of capital, to which men 
were subordinated; capital was disclosed, not as the benign donor of benefits, 
but as the appropriator of surplus labour; factional &#8216;interests&#8217; were disclosed 
as antagonistic classes; and contradiction displaced the sum progress. But what 
we have at the end, is not the overthrow of &#8216;Political Economy&#8217; but <i>another</i> 
&#8216;Political Economy.&#8217;<a href="#n57" name="fn57" target="_self">[57]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Insofar as Marx&#8217;s categories were anti-categories, Marxism was 
marked, at a critical stage in its development, by the categories of Political 
Economy: the chief of which was the notion <i>of</i> the &#8216;economic&#8217;, as a 
first-order activity, capable of isolation in this way, as the object of a 
science giving rise to laws whose operation would over-ride second-order 
activities. And , there is another mark also, which it is difficult to identify 
without appearing to be absurd. But the absurdities to which this error has been 
taken in the work of Althusser and his colleagues - that is, the absurdities of 
a certain kind of static self-circulating &#8216;Marxist&#8217; structuralism - enable us to 
risk the ridicule. There is an important sense in which the movement of Marx&#8217;s 
thought, in the <i>Grundrisse</i>, is locked inside <i>a static, anti-historical 
structure.</i></p>

<p class="fst">When we recall that Marx and Engels ceaselessly ridiculed the 
pretensions of bourgeois economy to disclose &#8216;fixed and eternal&#8217; laws, 
independent of historical specificity; when we recall the movement <i>within</i> 
the structure, the accumulation of capital, the declining rate of profit; and 
when we recall that Marx sketched, even in the <i>Grundrisse</i>, capital in 
terms of the development of its historical forms, then the proposition seems 
absurd. After all, Marx and Engels enabled historical materialism to be born. 
And yet the proposition has force. For once capital has emerged on the page, its 
self-development is determined by the innate logic inherent within the category, 
and the relations so entailed, in much the same way as &#8216;the market&#8217; operates 
within bourgeois Political Economy, and still does so within some &#8216;modernization 
theory&#8217; today Capital, is an operative category which laws its own development, 
and capitalism is the effect, in social formations, of these laws. This mode of 
analysis must necessarily be anti-historical, since the actual history can only 
be seen as the expression of ulterior laws; and historical evidence, or 
contemporary (empirically-derived) evidence, will then be seen as Althusser sees 
it, as instances or illustrations confirming these laws. But when capital and 
its relations are seen as a structure, in a given moment of capital&#8217;s forms, 
then this structure has a categorical stasis: that is, it can allow for no 
impingement of any influence from any other region (any region not allowed for 
in the terms and discourse of this discipline) which could modify its relations, 
for this would threaten the integrity and fixity of the categories themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">This is an extraordinary mode of thought to find in a 
materialist, for capital has become Idea, which unfolds itself in history. We 
remember so well Marx&#8217;s imprecations against idealism, and his claims to have 
inverted Hegel, that we do not allow ourselves to see what is patently there. In 
the <i>Grundrisse</i> - and not once or twice, but in the whole mode of 
presentation - we have examples of <i>unreconstructed</i> Hegelianism. Capital 
posits conditions <i>Hn accordance with its immanent essence</i>&#8217;,<a href="#n58" name="fn58" target="_self">[58]</a> 
reminding us that Marx had studied Hegel&#8217;s Philosophy of Nature, and had noted 
of &#8216;the Idea as nature&#8217; that &#8216;reality is posited with immanent determinateness 
of form.&#8217;<a href="#n59" name="fn59" target="_self">[59]</a> Capital posits this 
and that, creates this and that, and if we are to conceive of capitalism (&#8216;the 
inner construction of modern society&#8217;) it can only be as &#8216;capital in the 
totality of its relations.&#8217;<a href="#n60" name="fn60" target="_self">[60]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is true that Marx reminds us (or is he reminding himself?) 
that &#8216;the new forces of production and relations of production&#8217; of capital &#8216;do 
not develop out of <i>nothing . . .</i> nor from the womb of the self-positing 
Idea.&#8217; But he goes on, immediately, to add:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;While in the complicated bourgeois system every economic 
relation presupposes every other in its bourgeois economic form, and everything 
posited is thus also a presupposition, this is the case with every organic 
system. This organic system itself, as a totality, has its presuppositions, and 
its development to its totality consists precisely in subordinating all elements 
of society to itself, or in creating out of it the organs which it still lacks.&#8221;<a href="#n61" name="fn61" target="_self">[61]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The &#8216;organic system&#8217; is then its own subject, and it is this 
anti-historical stasis or <i>closure</i> which I have been indicating. The &#8216;it&#8217; 
inside this organism is capital, the soul of the organ, and &#8216;it&#8217; subordinates 
all elements of society to itself and creates out of society &#8216;its&#8217; own organs.</p>

<p class="fst">The point is not only that in the light of this kind of lapse 
Engels&#8217;s warnings to Schmidt are necessary and salutary: concepts and economic 
laws have no reality &#8216;except as approximation&#8217;: &#8216;Did feudalism ever correspond 
to its concepts?&#8217; There is a point of greater importance. For Marx has moved 
across an invisible conceptual line from <i>Capital</i> (an abstraction of 
Political Economy, which is his proper concern) to <i>capitalism</i> (&#8216;the 
complicated bourgeois system&#8217;), that is, the whole society, conceived of as an 
&#8216;organic system.&#8217; But the whole society comprises many activities and relations 
(of power, of consciousness, sexual, cultural, normative) which are not the 
concern of Political Economy, which have been <i>defined out of</i> Political 
Economy, and for which it has no terms. Therefore Political Economy cannot show 
capitalism as &#8216;capital in the totality of its relations&#8217;: it has no language or 
terms to do this. Only a historical materialism which could bring all activities 
and relations within a coherent view could do this. And, in my view, subsequent 
historical materialism has <i>not</i> found this kind of &#8216;organism&#8217;, working out 
its own self-fulfilment with inexorable idealist logic, nor has it found any 
society which can be simply described as &#8216;capital in the totality of its 
relations.&#8217; &#8216;We&#8217; have <i>never</i> let it get so far as that: even Fascism, 
which might be offered as &#8216;its&#8217; most ferocious manifestation, would then have to 
be glossed as an expression of its irrationality, not of its inherent rational 
logic. But historical materialism has found that Marx had a most profound 
intuition, an intuition which in fact <i>preceded</i> the <i>Grundrisse</i>: 
that the logic of capitalist process has found expression within all the 
activities of a society, and exerted a determining pressure upon its development 
and form:</p>

<p class="fst">hence entitling us to speak of capitalism, or of capitalist 
societies. But this is a very different conclusion, a critically different 
conclusion, which gives us an organicist structuralism on one side (ultimately 
an Idea of capital unfolding itself) and a real historical process on the other.</p>

<p class="fst">This is only a part of the <i>Grundrisse</i>, of course. And, of 
course, Marx conceived of himself, pugnaciously, as a materialist. In his 
introduction he vindicated his method, of proceeding from abstractions to the 
concrete in thought; and his method was largely vindicated in the results: only 
by the fiercest abstraction could he crack those categories apart. But he also 
discounted, in cavalier fashion, the inherent dangers of the method. Hegel went 
astray because, proceeding by this method, he &quot;fell into the illusion of 
conceiving the real as the product of thought unfolding itself out of itself.&#8217; 
It seemed so easy to cast this silly illusion aside, but to proceed by much the 
same method. But if Marx never forgot that thought was not self-generating but 
was &#8216;a product, rather, of the working-up of observation and conception into 
concepts,&#8217;<a href="#n62" name="fn62" target="_self">[62]</a> this mode of 
abstraction could still give him, on occasion, capital as the unfolding of its 
own idea.</p>

<p class="fst">I think that, for ten years, Marx <i>was</i> in this trap. His 
delays, his carbuncles, cannot all be attributed to the bourgeoisie. When he 
came to write <i>Capital</i> the trap had been in some part sprung. I am not 
expert enough to describe his partial self-deliverance, but I would suggest four 
considerations. First, the trap was never fully closed. Marx had conceived of 
capitalism in historical terms in the 1840s, continued to do so, by fits and 
starts, in the <i>Grundrisse</i>, and these were also years in which applied and 
concrete political analysis continued to flow from his pen. Second, and 
alongside this, he continued to develop, not only in his historical but also in 
his practical political experience, as a historical actor in his own part, and 
in observing the growth, flux and recession of working-class struggles in 
Europe. These two considerations are self-evident.</p>

<p class="fst">The other two may be more controversial. For the third, I would 
emphasize once again the important influence of <i>The Origin of Species</i> 
(1859). I am aware that my admiration for Darwin is regarded as an amiable (or 
guilty) eccentricity, and that there is a general mind-set among progressive 
intellectuals which attributes to Darwin the sins of teleological evolutionism, 
positivism, social Malthusianism, and apologias for exploitation (the &#8216;survival 
of the fittest&quot;) and of racism.<a href="#n63" name="fn63" target="_self">[63]</a> 
But I am not convinced of these objections, and, to be honest, I am not even 
convinced that all these critics have read <i>The Origin of Species</i>, nor 
read informed scientific evaluations of it. I know very well how Darwin&#8217;s ideas 
were put to use by others, and I also know of his subsequent (rather few) 
lapses. But what is remarkable in his work is the way in which he argues through 
rigorously, and in an empirical mode, the logic of evolution which is <i>not</i> 
a teleology, whose conclusions are <i>not</i> entailed in their premises, but 
which is still subject to rational explanation.<a href="#n64" name="fn64" target="_self">[64]</a> 
In any case, my admiration, whether innocent or not, was certainly shared by 
Engels and Marx. Marx read the book in December 1860, and at once wrote to 
Engels: &#8216;Although it is developed in the crude English style, this is the book 
which contains the basis in natural history for our view.&#8217; To Lassalle he wrote 
in the next month, the book &#8216;is very important and serves me as a basis in 
natural science for the class struggle in history . . . Despite all 
deficiencies, not only is <i>the death-blow dealt here for the first time to 
'teleology' in the natural sciences but their rational meaning is empirically 
explained?</i><a href="#n65" name="fn65" target="_self">[65]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There are two important recognitions here: first, Marx 
recognised, grudgingly, that the empirical method, however &#8216;crude&#8217;, however 
&#8216;English', had educed a substantial contribution to knowledge; second, Marx 
recognised in the <i>non-teleological</i> explication of a rational logic in 
natural process &#8216;a basis . . . for our view&#8217;, indeed &#8216;a basis in natural science 
for the class struggle in history.&#8217; There is surely a recognition here that this 
&#8216;basis&#8217; had <i>not</i> been provided before (in the <i>Grundrisse</i>), and even 
the suggestion that Marx was aware that his abstractionist mode of procedure was 
not proof against such teleology? It is not that Marx supposed that Darwinian 
analogies could be taken unreconstructed from the animal to the human world: he 
very soon reproved a correspondent who, with the aid of Malthus, was supposing 
that.<a href="#n66" name="fn66" target="_self">[66]</a> It is rather a question 
of method, in which Darwin&#8217;s work was taken as exemplar of the rational 
explication of the logic of process, which, in new terms, must be developed in 
historical practice. And I cannot see that we have any licence to pass this off 
as some momentary fancy. Still, in 1873, Marx took the trouble to send to Darwin 
a copy of <i>Capital</i>, inscribed by him as a gift from 'his sincere admirer.&#8217;<a href="#n67" name="fn67" target="_self">[67]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is at this time (1860) that the work of fashioning the <i>
Grundrisse</i> into <i>Capital</i> commenced. And this leads me to my fourth 
consideration. It appears to me that Marx was more self-critical of his earlier 
work than many commentators allow. I will not delay to puzzle over the various 
hints that survive as to his own self-dissatisfaction.<a href="#n68" name="fn68" target="_self">[68]</a> 
But in my view the writing of <i>Capital</i> involved a radical re-structuring 
of his materials, in ways partiy influenced by <i>The Origin of Species.</i> It 
is argued (for example, by Martin Nicolaus, the editor of the <i>Grundrisse</i>) 
that the changes may be attributed to Marx&#8217;s desire to make his work more 
&#8216;popular&#8217;, more &#8216;concrete&#8217;, and hence more widely available to the revolutionary 
movement; but &#8216;the <i>inner</i> structure of <i>Capital is identical</i> in the 
main lines to the <i>Grundrisse</i>.&#8217; In the first, &#8216;the method is visible; in <i>
Capital</i> it is deliberately, consciously hidden . . .&#8217; I do not think so. And 
I think even less of the attempt to explain away Marx&#8217;s letter to Engels (15 
August 1863), in which he writes of the slow progress of <i>Capitals</i> and 
explains that he has &#8216;had to turn everything round&#8217;, as meaning that &#8216;he had to 
overthrow virtually all of previous Political Economy.&#8217; The phrase is this: 
&#8216;when I look at this compilation now and see how I have had to turn everything 
round and how I had to make even the <i>historical</i> part out of material of 
which some was quite unknown&#8217;: and it cannot bear this construction. The 
&#8216;overthrow&#8217; of previous political economy had been done, already, in the 
notebooks (<i>Grundrisse</i>) of 1857-8; what was new was &#8216;the historical part&#8217; 
and the &#8216;turning around&#8217; of the rest.<a href="#n69" name="fn69" target="_self">[69]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This turning round, I am arguing, involved not only adding a 
historical dimension to the work, and much greater concrete exemplification 
(derived from empirical investigation) but also attempting to bring under 
control and reduce to the rational explication of process the &#8216;idealist&#8217; (even 
self-fulfilling, teleological) formulations derived from the abstractionist 
mode. What comes into <i>Capital</i>, in a new way, is a sense of history, and a 
concretion of exemplification (accompanied, we recall, by &#8216;extraneous&#8217; 
expressions of wrath).</p>

<p class="fst">And yet Nicolaus is not wholly wrong; in some part - and that 
part specifically the anti-structure of &#8216;Political Economy' - the structure of <i>
Capital</i> remains that of the <i>Grundrisse</i>,<a href="#n70" name="fn70" target="_self">[70]</a> 
It remains a study of the logic of capital, not of capitalism, and the social 
and political dimensions of the history, the wrath, and the understanding of the 
class struggle arise from a region independent of the closed system of economic 
logic. In that sense <i>Capital</i> was - and probably had to be - a product of 
theoretical miscegenation. But miscegenation of this order is no more possible 
in theory than in the animal kingdom, for we cannot leap across the fixity of 
categories or of species. So that we are forced to agree with seven generations 
of critics: <i>Capital</i> is a mountainous inconsistency. As pure Political 
Economy it may be faulted for introducing external categories; its laws cannot 
be verified, and its predictions were wrong. As &#8216;history&#8217; or as &#8216;sociology&#8217; it 
is abstracted to a &#8216;model&#8217;, which has heuristic value, but which follows too 
obsequiously ahistorical economic laws.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Capital</i> was not an exercise of a different order to that 
of mature bourgeois Political Economy, but a total confrontation <i>within</i> 
that order. As such, it is both the highest achievement of &#8216;political economy&#8217;, 
and it signals the need for its supersession by historical materialism. To say 
the former is not to diminish Marx&#8217;s achievement, for it is only in the light of 
that achievement that we are able to make this judgement. But the achievement 
does not <i>produce</i> historical materialism, it provides the preconditions 
for its production. A unitary knowledge of society (which is always in motion, 
hence a historical knowledge) cannot be won from a &#8216;science&#8217; which, as a 
presupposition of its discipline, isolates certain kinds of activity only for 
study, and provides no categories for others. And the structure of <i>Capital</i> 
remains marked by the categories of his antagonist, notably <i>economy</i> 
itself. In this sense it is true that in <i>Capital</i> &#8216;history&#8217; is introduced 
to provide exemplification and &#8216;illustration&#8217; for a structure of theory which is 
not derived from this discipline. However reluctantly, we must go half-way 
towards the positions of Althusser and Balibar. But we need not go all the way, 
for these &#8216;illustrations&#8217; would have been of no value if they were <i>wrong</i>, 
snatched from &#8216;history&#8217;s&#8217; received accounts, and not both researched (&#8216;I had to 
make even the <i>historical</i> part out of material of which some was quite 
unknown&#8217;) and interrogated in new ways.</p>

<p class="fst">It is more true to say that the history in <i>Capital</i>, and in 
attendant writings, is immensely fruitful <i>as hypothesis</i>, and yet as 
hypothesis which calls in question, again and again, the adequacy of the 
categories of Political Economy. We find here a veritable cornucopia of 
hypotheses, informed by consistent theoretical propositions (the determining 
pressures of the mode of production), hypotheses which historical materialism 
has been setting to work ever since. But setting them to work has not involved 
only &#8216;testing&#8217; them or &#8216;verifying&#8217; them,<a href="#n71" name="fn71" target="_self">[71]</a> 
it has also entailed revising and replacing them. Even Marx&#8217;s more elaborated 
historical hypotheses (for example, as to the struggle to lengthen the working 
day, or as to the enclosure movement in England and its relation to labour 
supply for industry), as well as his more cryptic or more complex hypotheses 
(for example, as to the transition from feudalism to capitalism, or as to the 
British &#8216;bourgeois revolution&#8217;, or as to &#8216;oriental despotism&#8217; and the &#8216;Asiatic 
mode of production&#8217;) have always undergone, in historical materialism&#8217;s own 
discourse of the proof, either reformation or very much more radical change.<a href="#n72" name="fn72" target="_self">[72]</a></p>

<p class="fst">How could it be otherwise? To suppose differently would be to 
suppose, not only that everything can be said at once, but that immanent Theory 
(or Knowledge) found its miraculous embodiment in Marx, not fully mature to be 
sure (it had yet to develop to Althusser&#8217;s full stature), but already 
perfectly-formed and justly-proportioned in all its parts. This is a 
fairy-story, recited to children in Soviet primary classes, and not even 
believed by them. <i>Capital,</i> volume I, is rich in historical hypotheses; 
volumes II and III are less so; the &#8216;anti-structure&#8217; of Political Economy 
narrows once again.<a href="#n73" name="fn73" target="_self">[73]</a> Marx&#8217;s 
hope of himself developing historical materialism in practice remained, very 
largely, unfulfilled. It was left to the old clown, Frederick Engels, to make 
some attempts to remedy that; and his essay in historical anthropology, <i>The 
Origin of the Family</i> (Darwin&#8217;s influence again!) is generally taken by 
Marxist anthropologists today to exemplify the infancy rather than the maturity 
of their knowledge.</p>

<p class="fst">In his final years, Engels looked around in alarm and noted the 
gathering consequences of their great omission. There are &#8216;many allusions&#8217; to 
the theory of historical materialism in <i>Capital</i> (he wrote to Bloch in 
1890), and &#8216;Marx hardly wrote anything in which it did not play a part.&#8217; But he 
wrote nothing in which it played a leading part, and Bloch was directed to <i>
Anti-Duhring</i> and <i>Ludwig Feuerbach</i> as the places in which might be 
found &#8216;the most detailed account of historical materialism which, so far as I 
know, exists.&#8217; And, in the same year, to Conrad Schmidt, &#8216;All history must be 
studied afresh, the conditions of existence of the different formations of 
society must be individually examined before the attempt is made to deduce from 
them the political, civil-legal, aesthetic, philosophic, religious, etc., 
notions corresponding to them. Only a little has been done here up to now.</p>

<p class="fst">It is sobering to reflect upon how many human activities (for 
none of which Political Economy afforded categories) are comprised within this 
sentence. But Engels was in an increasingly sober mood:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Too many of the younger Germans simply make use of the 
phrase, historical materialism (and <i>everything</i> can be turned into a 
phrase), in order to get their own relatively scanty historical knowledge (for 
economic history is still in its cradle!) fitted together into a neat system as 
quickly as possible, and then they think themselves something very tremendous.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">So that not only historical materialism, but the region of it 
most immediately proximate to <i>Capital</i>, economic history, Engels could see 
to be &#8216;still in its cradle.&#8217; It now seemed to him, with gathering urgency, that 
what was wrong with Marx&#8217;s uncompleted life-work, <i>Capital</i>, was that it 
was not historical <i>enough.</i> To Mehring, in 1893:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There is only one other point lacking, which, however, Marx 
and I always failed to stress enough in our writings and in regard to which we 
are all equally guilty. We all, that is to say, laid and were bound to lay the 
main emphasis at first on the derivation of political, juridical and other 
ideological notions, and of the actions arising through the medium of these 
notions, from basic economic facts. But in so doing we neglected the formal side 
- the way in which these notions come about - for the sake of the content.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">&#8216;It is the old story&#8217; Engels continued: &#8216;Form is always neglected 
at first for content.&#8217; But this failure had given purchase to the criticisms of 
&#8216;the ideologists&#8217;, with their -</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Fatuous notion . . . that because we deny an independent 
historical development to the various ideological spheres which play a part in 
history we also deny them any effect in history. The basis of this is the common 
undialectical conception of cause and effect as rigidly opposite poles, the 
total disregarding of interaction ...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The letters are familiar, and it may be wondered why I rehearse 
them. I do this now to emphasise, first, that Engels clearly acknowledged that 
Marx had <i>assumed</i> a theory of historical materialism which he had neither 
fully posed nor begun to develop. For some part of its proposition we are, 
indeed, dependent upon Engels&#8217;s late letters. Althusser ridicules these letters, 
but we should note a curiosity in the fact that he can, in the same moment, 
borrow notions (&#8216;relative autonomy,&#8217; &#8216;in-the-last-instance determination&#8217;) of 
central importance to his thought from passages which lie cheek-by-jowl in the 
same letters which he lampoons. I will add that these letters were as familiar 
to me and to fellow practitioners in historical materialism in 1948 as in 1978, 
and that this was where we started <i>from.</i> We did not have to wait upon 
Althusser to learn that the <i>critical</i> problems lay in the area of 
&#8216;relative autonomy&#8217;, etc.; these phrases pointed towards the problems which we 
then set out in our practice to examine. I will come back to this question, 
since it indicates a very different Marxist tradition from that of Althusser.</p>

<p class="fst">The second reason for rehearsing these letters is that we find in 
them that Engels is (as I think) correctly indicating the area of the largest 
(and most dangerous and ambiguous) of the real silences left by Marx&#8217;s death - 
and shortly to be sealed by his own. But in the same moment, in the very terms 
in which he discusses this absent theory he reveals the inadequacy of its terms. 
For &#8216;political, juridical and other ideological notions&#8217; cannot be derived from 
&#8216;economic facts&#8217; within a discourse of Political Economy so exacting that its 
very definitions of the &#8216;economic&#8217; affords to these extraneous evidences no 
entry. And the notion that the concepts of Marxism should be historical 
categories and &#8216;subject to change and transformation&#8217; would play havoc with the 
credentials of Marxism as an exact &#8216;science&#8217; of the capitalist mode of 
production. So that Engels is saying, in effect, that historical materialism and 
Marxist Political Economy have failed to find a common junction and a 
theoretical vocabulary capable of encompassing both process and structure; that 
Marxism is in danger of becoming imprisoned within the categories of <i>Capital</i>; 
but that the pressure of incipient historical materialism can be seen within its 
structure (in its <i>in</i>consistencies as much as its hypotheses), which 
pressure he could authenticate (from Marx&#8217;s other work and from their long 
common project). He wished, in these final letters, to give to historical 
materialism a charter of liberation from the structure of the old <i>Grundrisse</i>, 
but he could not solve the theoretical problems thus entailed nor find the terms 
to do so. Subsequent historical materialism, in its practice - although 
insufficiently in its theory - has sought to serve under this charter of 
liberation. Althusser and his colleagues seek to thrust historical materialism 
back into the prison of the categories of Political Economy.</p>

<p class="fst">I think that contemporary Marxist economists are right to note 
that &#8216;in <i>Capital</i>. . . Marx repeatedly uses the concept of the circuit of 
capital to characterise the structure of the capitalist economy&#8217; - and, more 
than that, of capitalist society more generally.<a href="#n74" name="fn74" target="_self">[74]</a> 
But historical materialism (as assumed as hypothesis by Marx, and as 
subsequently developed in our practice) must be concerned with other &quot;circuits&#8217; 
also: the circuits of power, of the reproduction of ideology, etc., and these 
belong to a different logic and to other categories. Moreover, historical 
analysis does not allow for static contemplation of &#8216;circuits&#8217;, but is immersed 
in moments when all systems go and every circuit sparks across the other. So 
that Engels is in this sense wrong: it is not true that he and Marx &#8216;neglected 
the formal side - the way in which these notions come about - for the sake of 
the content&#8217; It was, rather, the over-development of the formal side, in the 
&#8216;anti-structure&#8217; of Political Economy, which in its genesis and form was derived 
from a bourgeois construction, and which confined the real historical content 
into impermissible and unpassable forms.</p>

<p class="fst">Our concern must now be to approach this problem from a different 
aspect: the alternative heuristics of &#8216;structure&#8217; and of &#8216;process.&#8217; But, first, 
may we take a brief adieu of our old clown? It is now <i>de rigueur</i> to make 
old Engels into a whipping boy, and to impugn to him any sign that one chooses 
to impugn to subsequent Marxisms. All this has now been written out, and by many 
hands, and I need not go over it all again.<a href="#n75" name="fn75" target="_self">[75]</a> 
I am willing to agree that several of the charges stick. Thus I think it is true 
that in his writings i) Engels gave credibility to epistemological &#8216;reflection 
theory&#8217;,<a href="#n76" name="fn76" target="_self">[76]</a> ii) he introduced a 
paradigm of &#8216;natural process&#8217; (a misapplied Darwinism) in his anthropological 
and historical work, which drifted towards a positive evolutionism, iii) he 
certainly introduced - as did, with equal certainty, Marx - historicist notions 
of lawed and pre-determined development. These are heavy charges, although I 
cannot accept the pleadings which always find Marx and Lenin innocent and leave 
Engels alone in the dock. And to these I have added my own, more marginal, 
charges, as to Engels&#8217;s unfortunate and ill-considered influence in the 
formative British socialist movement.<a href="#n77" name="fn77" target="_self">[77]</a> 
But when all this has been said, what an extraordinary, dedicated and versatile 
man he was! How closely he followed his own times, how far he risked himself - 
further, often, than Marx - in engagements with his contemporary historical and 
cultural thought, how deeply and passionately he was engaged in a movement which 
was spreading to the five continents, how generously he gave himself in his last 
years to the paper of his old friend and to the incessant correspondence of the 
movement! If we must learn, on occasion, from his errors, then he would have 
expected this to be so. And it is, least of all, for the &#8216;revisionist&#8217; letters 
of his last decade that he is to be cast as a whipping-boy.</p>

<p class="fst">It is taken to be a truism by the young that older is worse than 
younger, but I cannot see that Engels exemplifies that general case. The 
&#8216;General&#8217;, in his last decade, did not renege upon the propositions of his 
youth; rather, he dwelt nostalgically upon &#8216;the salad days&#8217; of the 1840s, and in 
the wisdom and foreboding of age he noted that there was something in the young 
movement of the 1880s and 1890s which was turning away from the intuitions of 
his and Marx&#8217;s original theses. If he is to be punished, he should be punished 
for these late letters of qualification and of warning least of all. That the 
letters proposed, but did not answer, many problems can be agreed; but if the 
warnings had been fully attended to, then the history of Marxism might have been 
different. I will not allow Frederick Engels to be cast as a senile clown after 
all. He should be taken, until his last year, as he would have wished: his great 
sanity, his errors, his breadth of understanding (but his excessive &#8216;family&#8217; 
possessiveness) of the movement, all inter-mixed.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h10">x</a></h3>

<p class="fst">We will now discuss structure and process. It is customary at 
this point to launch into a long disquisition on the diachronic and the 
synchronic heuristics. But I hope that we may take this as read. However 
eloquent, the disquisition is likely to leave us with the conclusion that <i>
both</i> heuristics are valid and necessary. I must make it clear, without 
equivocation, that in the argument which follows I am not disputing the 
necessity for synchronic procedures in social, economic and (on occasion) in 
historical analysis. Such procedures (a general view of a whole society, 
&#8216;frozen&#8217; at a certain moment, or a systematic isolation from the whole of 
certain selected activities) have always been employed by historians, and a 
glance down the volumes of our &#8216;trade&#8217; journals (for example, <i>Past and 
Present</i> or <i>Annales E.S.C.</i> or the <i>Economic History Review</i>) will 
show that specialist synchronic vocabularies have been brought to interrogate 
&#8216;history&#8217; more frequently in the last three decades than at any previous period.</p>

<p class="fst">Historical materialism offers to study social process in its 
totality; that is, it offers to do this when it appears, not as another 
&#8216;sectoral&#8217; history - as economic, political, intellectual history, as history of 
labour, or as &#8216;social history&#8217; defined as yet another sector<a href="#n78" name="fn78" target="_self">[78]</a> 
- but as a total history of society, in which all other sectoral histories are 
convened. It offers to show in what determinate ways each activity was related 
to the other, the logic of this process and the rationality of causation. We 
need only to state this claim to note two observations which must at once follow 
upon it. First, historical materialism must, in this sense, be the discipline in 
which all other human disciplines meet. It is the unitary discipline, which must 
always keep watch over the isolating premises of other disciplines (and the 
fictional stasis entailed by the freezing of process in yet others), but whose 
maturity can only consist in its openness towards and its summation of the 
findings of those other disciplines. So - &#8216;History&#8217; must be put back upon her 
throne as the Queen of the humanities, even if she has sometimes proved to be 
rather deaf to some of her subjects (notably anthropology), and gullible towards 
favourite courtiers (such as econometrics). But, second, and to curb her 
imperialist pretentions, we should also observe that &#8216;History&#8217;, insofar as it is 
most unitary and general of all human disciplines, must always be the <i>least</i> 
precise. Her knowledge will never be, in however many thousand years, anything 
more than proximate. If she makes claims to be a precise science these are 
wholly spurious. But (as I have sufficiently argued) her knowledge remains 
knowledge, and it is attained through its own rigorous procedures of historical 
logic, its own discourse of the proof.</p>

<p class="fst">As we have seen, the credentials of historical materialism have, 
in the last decades, come under sustained and ferocious assault; and this 
assault has been mounted equally from positions within orthodox &#8216;bourgeois&#8217; 
academic disciplines (epistemology, sociology, etc.), from enclaves within the 
historical profession itself (genuine empiricism, quantitative positivism, 
etc.), and from a &#8216;Marxist&#8217; structuralism. And, as with epistemology, what 
distinguishes all these attacks - and what should be taken note of by Marxist 
philosophers and sociologists - is the <i>similarity</i> of their forms, their 
modes of argumentation and their conclusions. All commence by questioning the 
knowability of process, as a total logic of change of sets of inter-related 
activities, and end up by tilting the vocabularies of knowledge very heavily 
(even absolutely) towards synchronic rather than diachronic procedures. The 
diachronic is waived away as mere unstructured &#8216;narrative&#8217;, an unintelligible 
flow of one thing from another. Only the stasis of structural analysis can 
disclose knowledge. The flow of events (&#8216;historicist time&#8217;) is an empiricist 
fable. The logic of process is disallowed.</p>

<p class="fst">Before approaching this more closely I will stand back for a 
moment and take a historical perspective on this problem: for it seems to me 
that the rise of structuralism has real roots in historical experience, and that 
this drift of the modern mind must be seen to be, in some part, a drift of <i>
ideology.</i> Structuralism may indeed be seen as the illusion of this epoch, 
just as evolutionism (&#8216;progress&#8217;) and voluntarism have characterised earlier 
moments in this century. Evolutionism was a &#8216;natural&#8217; ideological confusion 
within the socialist movement in the decades preceding the First World War. Year 
by year (with minor &#8216;set-backs&#8217;) the movement was gathering force, new adhesions 
were announced to the International, trade union and party membership enlarged, 
more socialist deputies were elected. As Walter Benjamin was to comment:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Nothing has corrupted the German working class so much as the 
notion that it was moving with the current. It regarded technological 
developments as the fall of the stream with which it was moving. From there it 
was but a step to the illusion that the factory work which was supposed to tend 
toward technological progress constituted a political achievement.&#8221;<a href="#n79" name="fn79" target="_self">[79]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Marxism was hence infiltrated by the vocabulary (and even 
premises) of economic and technical &#8216;progress&#8217; - which in Britain meant the 
vocabulary of utilitarianism - and of an evolutionism which borrowed improperly 
from the natural sciences and Darwinism. In bad times and adversity, militants 
might still uphold their cause by means of an evolutionism which, as Gramsci 
showed, was compressed into a kind of determinist stamina: 'history' was on 
their side, and they would be vindicated in the end. While the First World War 
offered to this evolutionism a check, the October revolution gave to it a new 
and more utopian incarnation. Utopianism (in its customary Marxist denigratory 
notation<a href="#n80" name="fn80" target="_self">[80]</a>) has an astonishing 
and flourishing reincarnation within Marxism itself, in the form of a prettified 
and wholly fictional projection of &#8216;the Soviet Union': to outsiders this utopia 
was offered as the emblem of their own future &#8216;history&#8217;, their own glorious and 
inexorable future.</p>

<p class="fst">This evolutionism (and its vocabulary) persisted, of course, and 
notably in the former colonial world, where &#8216;evolution&#8217;, once again, seemed to 
be the ally of the militants: I have found the vocabulary (although fiercely 
disputed) still vigorous among Marxists in India today. But I think that there 
were ways in which the decade, 1936-46, gave to it a sharp check. Marxism, in 
the decisive emergencies of Fascist insurgence and of the Second World War, 
began to acquire the accents of voluntarism. Its vocabulary took on - as in 
Russia after 1917 it had taken on - more of the active verbs of agency, choice, 
individual initiative, resistance, heroism and sacrifice. Victory in those 
emergencies no longer seemed to be in the course of &#8216;evolution&#8217;: far from it.</p>

<p class="fst">The very conditions of war and repression - the dispersal of 
militants into armies, concentration camps, partisan detachments, underground 
organisations, even isolated positions - threw squarely upon them as individuals 
the necessity for political judgement and active initiation. It seemed, as the 
partisan detachment blew up the crucial railway bridge, that they were &#8216;making 
history&#8217;; it seemed, as the women endured the bombs or as the soldiers stood 
with their backs to Stalingrad, that &#8216;history' depended on their endurance. It 
was a decade of heroes, and there were Guevaras in every street and in every 
wood. The vocabulary of Marxism became infiltrated from a new direction: that of 
authentic liberalism (the choices of the autonomous individual) and perhaps also 
of Romanticism (the rebellion of spirit against the rules of fact). Poetry, 
rather than natural science or sociology, was welcomed as a cousin. It was all 
very disgusting, and., as events were to prove, futile. All that it left were 
the bones of our more heroic brothers and sisters to bleach on the plains of the 
past under a hallucinated utopian sun. And, to be sure (although a small matter) 
a war - a necessary and historic confrontation - that was won. But I cannot 
disclaim the fact that my own vocabulary and sensibility was marked by this 
disgraceful formative moment. Even now I must hold myself steady as I feel 
myself revert to the poetry of voluntarism. It is a sad confession, but I prefer 
it even today to the &#8216;scientific&#8217; vocabulary of structuralism.</p>

<p class="fst">The vocabulary of voluntarism survived for a little longer. It 
was done in technicolour in the Soviet epics of the Great Patriotic War. Once 
again, it survived longest, and with most justice and authenticity, in the 
colonial and - thence - the &#8216;Third World&#8217;. This or that political or military 
action against the imperialists could still command heroism, summon up 
initiatives, demand choices, and be felt as &#8216;making history.&#8217; The poetry arose 
in a late flaring of intensity in Cuba. And, as with evolutionism, voluntarism 
could even co-exist with adversity for a little while: for it was only by 
rebellion against the overwhelming presence of &#8216;established fact&#8217; that people 
could assert their humanity.<a href="#n81" name="fn81" target="_self">[81]</a> 
But in the past two decades both evolutionism and voluntarism have lost their 
nerve and have fallen silent, notably in the West. The vocabulary of 
structuralism has pushed all else aside.</p>

<p class="fst">And is this, now, at last the truth, the true Marxist vocabulary, 
restored to the original of Marx? We will examine this in its own terms in a 
moment. But our historical perspective must be continued until we come closer to 
our own self-knowledge. Voluntarism crashed against the wall of the Cold War. No 
account can convey the sickening jerk of deceleration between 1945 and 1948. 
Even in this country the Marxist Left seemed to be moving with &#8216;the fall of the 
stream&#8217; in 1945; in 1948 it was struggling to survive amidst an antagonistic 
current. In Eastern Europe that same sickening jerk stopped the hearts of 
Masaryk, Kostov and of Rajk. In the West our heads were thrown against the 
windscreen of capitalist society; and that screen felt like - <i>a structure.</i> 
'History&#8217;, so pliant to the heroic will in 1943 and 1944, seemed to congeal in 
an instant into two monstrous antagonistic structures, each of which allowed 
only the smallest latitude of movement within its operative realm. For more than 
two decades each impulse towards independent forward movement within either 
realm (Hungary 1956, Prague 1968, Chile 1973) has been suppressed with a 
brutality which has confirmed the paradigm of structural stasis. Even in those 
parts of the Third World, where the rival structures operate only by diplomatic, 
economic and ideological extension, the same field-of-force has been exerted. 
Only the immense and enigmatic presence of China has escaped (at the cost of 
self-isolation) from this structural stasis.</p>

<p class="fst">This mutual confrontation of imperial structures is without 
historical precedent: not even Christendom and Ottoman Empire confronted each 
other (save at their rubbing edges) so massively, so watchfully, with such 
all-pervasive ideological refraction. In the West the &#8216;natural&#8217; flow of social 
process coagulated to a thin stream of hesitant reformism (each individual 
reform achieved after immensely disproportionate effort). This at its best; more 
often, the regenerated capitalist mode of production simply co-opted and 
assimilated those reforms (the product of earlier struggles), assigned to them 
new functions, developed them as 'organs&#8217; of its own. Or this is how it <i>
seemed</i>: for, please note, in moving towards our present time, I have 
already, as if involuntarily, fallen into the vocabulary of structuralism, and 
reified a process which, however confusedly, was still the outcome of human 
choices and struggles. For this is my point: the vocabulary of structuralism was 
given by the seeming &#8216;common sense&#8217;, the manifest appearances, of three decades 
of Cold War stasis. And in its most pervasive accents, this has been a <i>
bourgeois</i> vocabulary, an apologia for the <i>status quo</i> and an invective 
against &#8216;utopian&#8217; and &#8216;mal-adjusted&#8217; heretics. By the 1950s structuralisms - 
sometimes the product of lonely minds working in prior contexts - were flowing <i>
with</i> the stream, and replicating themselves on every side as ideology: 
psychology was preoccupied with &#8216;adjustment&#8217; to &#8216;normality&#8217;, sociology with 
&#8216;adjustment&#8217; to a self-regulating social system, or within defining heretics as 
&#8216;deviants&#8217; from &#8216;the value-system&#8217; of the consensus, political theory with the 
circuits of psephology.<a href="#n82" name="fn82" target="_self">[82]</a> In the 
end, more ambitious and more sophisticated structuralisms have come into 
fashion. The vocabularies of structuralism have been borrowed, not from natural 
science or from poetry, but now from sociology, now from linguistics and 
anthropology, and now from the anti-structure of Marxist Political Economy - the 
&#8216;<i>Grundrisse</i> face&#8217; of Marx.</p>

<p class="fst">I must guard myself against a misunderstanding. When I speak of 
vocabularies in this sense, it is, very certainly, in their sense as ideology. 
That is, I have argued that in each of these periods there has been a pressure 
of real experience which has seemed to licence the adoption of a particular 
language of social and political analysis, an ideological predisposition towards 
one vocabulary or another. This ought to put us on our guard. The experiences of 
the decades before the First World War predisposed minds to adopt the premises 
and terms of evolutionism; the crisis years of 1917 and of 1936-46 were, like 
all revolutionary moments, propitious for the premises and terms of voluntarism; 
and the unprecedented stasis and, in the profoundest sense, historical 
conservatism (the continuous reproduction of material goods and of ideology 
within a seemingly-closed circuit) markedly dispose contemporary minds towards 
the premises and terms of structuralism. In this sense, a historian recognises 
in structuralism an analogy within the circulatory or clock-work-impelled 
justificatory systems of prior societies, and notes that these were generally <i>
ancien regimes</i> anxious to validate established power or middle-aged 
post-revolutionary regimes, anxious to consolidate power with an ideological 
apologia. So a historian, confronting structuralism, must sniff the air and 
scent a conservatism.</p>

<p class="fst">But this sniffing of the ideological air does not end the 
question. For, first, the very fact of this ideological predisposition is itself 
a kind of guarantee that the ideas in question have some partial correspondence 
to the historical moment: there <i>was</i> a 'progress&#8217; of the labour movement 
before the First World War, there <i>were</i> heroic initiatives and acts of 
will between 1936 and 1946, there <i>is</i> a profound sociological conservatism 
around us on each side today. So that we must recall that ideology has its own 
kind of &#8216;truth.&#8217; And, second, an ideological predisposition to accept a 
particular vocabulary does not, of course, in itself expose that language, its 
premises and terms, to be invalid. That must be the object of a distinct 
enquiry. One day a &#8216;conjuncture&#8217; may arrive when thousands of minds are 
simultaneously predisposed to believe - the truth! To be sure, historians know 
no records of such events. But perhaps, with Althusser, this utopian conjuncture 
has now at last arrived?</p>

<p class="fst">But let us first, before returning to Althusser, delay to admire 
another structuralism of our time, albeit one that is a little faded and 
unfashionable today. It falls to my hand because it happens to be a somewhat 
rare and audacious exercise, an attempt to replace structure within the 
historical record and to surmount the most difficult theoretical problem of any 
such system, the analysis of change through time. Let us first of all move 
directly to its vocabulary:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;From the industrial perspective the cotton-textile revolution 
appears as a dramatic rearrangement of all the factors of production. The 
revolution originated with a series of dissatisfactions legitimized by the 
dominant value-system of the day. In several sequences of differentiation the 
industry emerged with a structure more adequate to meet the demands of the 
foreign and domestic markets. Such a revolution naturally did not occur in a 
vacuum. It was initiated by non-economic elements such as religious values, 
political arrangements, and social stratification. At the same time, the 
industrial revolution in cotton created <i>a source of dissatisfaction,</i> 
which, when combined with other elements, initiated several sequences of 
differentiation in other social sub-systems.&#8221;<a href="#n83" name="fn83" target="_self">[83]</a></p>

<p class="fst">I don't have time here to enter closely into argument with 
Professor Smelser as to his use of sources, his selection and interpretation of 
these, nor as to the emptiness of his &#8216;boxes.&#8217; I wish now only to point to the 
reification of process entailed by the very vocabulary of analysis. Systems and 
sub-systems, elements and structures, are drilled up and down the pages 
pretending to be people. Smelser is anxious to show that social process occurred 
rationally and in an approved Parsonian fashion. There is a self-regulating 
social system (whose wisdom always appears most apparent if you happen to be at 
the top of it), &#8216;governed&#8217; by a value-system (which, again, is enshrined in the 
institutions and attitudes of the system&#8217;s governors), directed to goals 
legitimized by this value-system, which, when any major element within it 
differentiates structurally is precipitated into disequilibrium, resulting in 
dissatisfactions (always grossly misunderstood by those at the bottom, who, when 
they suffer, manifest &#8216;negative emotional reactions&#8217; and &#8216;unjustified 
disturbance symptoms&#8217;), but even these plebeian manifestations of irrationality 
the system is able to turn to functional account, since various superior 
non-economic &#8216;elements&#8217; somewhere at the top of the system (such as &#8216;political 
arrangements&#8217; or superior religious values or more simply the army and the 
police) &#8216;handle and channel&#8217; these disturbance symptoms, and, if the system&#8217;s 
organs should flash out a &#8216;justified&#8217; signal, devise, through several refined 
&#8216;steps&#8217;, &#8216;new ideas&#8217; or institutions (which however are always devised in forms 
more wise than those agitated for by the deluded sources of disturbance) - 
thereby bringing to the structurally-differentiated &#8216;system&#8217; a glorious return 
in &#8216;an extraordinary growth of production, capitalization and profits,&#8217; which, 
however, in the end falls short of the goals prescribed by the dominative 
value-system, thereby producing new dissatisfactions which in turn ... I don&#8217;t 
know how to extricate myself from this sentence, since the Parsonian system has 
indeed unlocked the secret of perpetual motion.</p>

<p class="fst">In this system there are no good or evil men; or, rather, all men 
are of equally neuter will, their wills surrendered into the inexorable will of 
social process. They are (or should be) the <i>trager</i> or supports of that 
process. The social will is beneficent: &#8216;the industry emerged with a structure 
more adequate to meet the demands of . . . markets.&#8217; And I have done Smelser an 
injustice in suggesting that he sees men and women only as inert passengers in 
this differentiating mechanism of reification, <i>left to itself</i> the system 
would move us all forward to meet the goal of larger markets. But unfortunately 
the &#8216;disturbance-symptoms&#8217; of the majority of those being moved are not only 
unjustified in minor ways but are often hugely unjustified. They become 
Luddites, trade unionists, Peterloo and Ten Hour Men, Chartists. They impede the 
thing-society from proceeding smoothly down its thing-ways to its 
thing-conclusion. It is fortunate that in contemporary societies we have 
sociologists who can explain to the disturbed that their symptoms are 
unjustified, and who can advise &#8216;political arrangements&#8217; as to the best means of 
&#8216;handling and channelling.&#8217; We all now know that phenomena which to the 
uninformed eye (or stomach) might appear as justified cause for disturbance are 
in fact manifestations of the ulterior working-out of a wisdom-thing. And behind 
this again one may glimpse an ancient theological form of thought: every 
phenomenon <i>must</i>, as an evidence of the Divine will, have a function.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course the Smelserian system&#8217;s pretence of transcending the 
insertion into &#8216;history&#8217; of intention and of norms is wholly specious. We have 
in this system, and at every stage, the imposition of exterior value. This is 
nowhere more clear than in Smelser&#8217;s handling of the value-system, whether as 
generalised concept or in relation to particular social groups, such as the 
handloom weavers. As theory he proposes this:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Every social system is governed by a value-system which 
specifies the nature of the system, its goals, and the means of attaining these 
goals. A social system&#8217;s first functional requirement is to preserve the 
integrity of the value-system itself and to assure that individual actors 
conform to it. This involves socializing and educating individuals, as well as 
providing tension-control mechanisms for handling and resolving individual 
disturbances relating to the values.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This snake has, however, already got its tail deeply into its own 
mouth. For on the same page, Smelser has told us:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;A social system ... is governed by a value-system which 
defines and legitimizes the activities of the social system. Second, these 
values are institutionalized into regulatory patterns which govern the 
interaction of the more concrete units. Third, the more concrete units 
specialize in social sub-systems which cluster around functional imperatives 
governing the social system.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">But also (on another page) the value-system in its own judge and 
arbitrator: &#8216;it specifies the conditions under which members of the system 
should express dissatisfactions and prepare to undertake change.&#8217; Values alone 
lie outside this model of structural differentiation. If they change, they 
change &#8216;more slowly than social structure,&#8217; and this is a separate analytical 
problem.'<a href="#n84" name="fn84" target="_self">[84]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This is a proper epistemological pudding. The first relation 
proposed between value-system and social system is symbiotic. The social system 
is &#8216;governed' by the value-system, which, indeed, selects the system&#8217;s goals; 
but equally the social system&#8217;s &#8216;first functional requirement is to preserve the 
integrity of the value-system.&#8217; Hence value-system and social system are 
mutually supportive, but of the two the first is prior. The first function of 
the social system is to reproduce in their integrity the values which govern it. 
This is where the snake got its tail into its mouth. Now it begins to swallow 
itself. For the social system is also made up of &#8216;concrete units&#8217; (not, alas, as 
yet people!), specialized in &#8216;social sub-systems which cluster around functional 
imperatives governing the social system.&#8217; But we have already been informed as 
to what the <i>first</i> of these functional imperatives is: to preserve the 
integrity of the value-system. What is society? It is a value-system whose first 
function is, through the mediation of empty boxes and an ugly terminology, to 
reproduce its own value-system.</p>

<p class="fst">Who holds these values? If choice appears, who decides which sets 
of value are the dominant value-system? The snake - or what is left of it, for 
it is now a wriggling knot - has an answer to this too. The value-system which 
is dominant is exactly that which dominates. (It is not necessary to go further 
and say the values of those who hold political, economic and other institutional 
(e.g. religious, academic) <i>power</i>, since power has been tabulated 
somewhere among &#8216;political arrangements&#8217; whose function is the attainment of 
goals selected by &#8216;the&#8217; value-system). Moreover, the value-system itself 
&#8216;specifies&#8217; whether dissatisfactions should or should not arise: that is, it 
actively inhibits alternative values from arising and provides &#8216;tension-control 
mechanisms&#8217; for &#8216;resolving individual disturbances relating to values.&#8217; Plop! 
The snake has disappeared into total theoretical vacuity.</p>

<p class="fst">It is, pf course, a highly conservative vacuity: what is governs 
what is whose first function is to preserve the integrity of is-ness; what 
dominates has the functional imperative of preserving its own dominance. As 
presented by Smelser, this structural theory cannot be criticised in terms of 
alternative theories of process or of class conflict because the terminology of 
his theory is so fashioned that such concepts may not at any point be allowed to 
enter. The vocabulary excludes criticism before criticism can commence.</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, as I have said, we have in this system, at every 
stage, the imposition of exterior value. There was not, of course, in the 
industrial history which Smelser offers to restructure <i>one</i> dominant 
value-system but many competing sets of value, one of which was dominant only 
because it was professed by men who held power. The values of Poor Law 
Commissioners and of paupers, of Assistant Hand-Loom Weavers Commissioners and 
of weavers, can&#8217;t be subsumed within the same system. And even if we attempt to 
do so, by gesturing at some vague notions like &#8216;independence&#8217;, we find that the 
social system is so structured that what makes for the independence of some men 
makes for the dependence of others. The &#8216;social system&#8217; had no &#8216;goal&#8217;, no 
internalised intentionality, since the men and women within that system pursued 
opposing goals and intentions. Smelser has simply commenced analysis by assuming 
his own goal, which is the old one of Weberian rationalisation in pursuit of 
maximum economic growth. Deep within his thing-mechanism, masked but still at 
the controls, is Sombart&#8217;s entrepreneur, a man of unimpeachable goodwill whose 
only motivation is to maximise his own profits and hence the productive 
resources of mankind. Here is the <i>primum mobile</i> of the capitalist system. 
And this is why Smelser&#8217;s system, in its larger pretentions,<a href="#n85" name="fn85" target="_self">[85]</a> 
not only outrages the discourse of historical logic but is, as sociology, only 
to be understood as a moment of capitalist ideology.</p>

<p class="fst">As ideology it may, perhaps, be seen as the product of that 
moment of polarised ideological stasis at the height of the Cold War which I 
have already indicated.<a href="#n86" name="fn86" target="_self">[86]</a> It was 
also at this moment that Stalinism afforded a caricature of Marxism, which 
offered, in very different terminology but with an equally abstracted 
vocabulary, an identical reification of process, in which a &#8216;superstructure&#8217; was 
reduced to confirming or legitimating a base. This &#8216;base&#8217; (Stalin wrote in 1950) 
&#8216;is the economic structure of society at a given stage of its development&#8217;, and 
&#8216;the superstructure consists of the political, legal, religious, artistic, and 
philosophical views of society and the political, legal, and other institutions 
corresponding to them:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The superstructure is a product of the base; but this does 
not mean that it merely reflects the base, that it is passive, neutral, 
indifferent to the fate of its base, to the fate of the classes, to the 
character of the system. On the contrary, no sooner does it arise than it 
becomes an exceedingly active force, actively assisting its base to take shape 
and consolidate itself, and doing everything it can to help the new system 
finish off and eliminate the old base and the old classes.</p>

<p class="quoteb">It cannot be otherwise. The base creates the superstructure 
precisely in order that it may serve it, that it may actively help it to take 
shape and consolidate itself, and that it may actively strive for the 
elimination of the old, moribund base and its old superstructure.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This appears to say: &quot;What is creates what is whose first 
function is to consolidate its own is-ness - and also to clobber whatever was.&#8217; 
This is an approximate description of High Stalinism, in which the State was 
indeed &#8216;an exceedingly active force&#8217; doing everything it could to &#8216;finish off 
and eliminate the old base and the old classes,&#8217; although historians of the 
Soviet Union nourish a suspicion that at a certain stage the &#8216;is&#8217; of Stalin&#8217;s 
superstructure was artificially (and in a theoretically improper way) creating 
its own base. This consorts less easily with another of Stalin&#8217;s remarkable 
formulations:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The superstructure is not directly connected with production, 
with man&#8217;s productive activity. It is connected with production only indirectly 
through the economy, through the base. The superstructure therefore does not 
reflect changes of development of the productive forces immediately and 
directly, but only after changes in the base, through the prism of changes 
wrought in the base by the changes in production. This means that the sphere of 
action of the superstructure is narrow and restricted.&#8221;<a href="#n87" name="fn87" target="_self">[87]</a></p>

<p class="fst">My point is not, in these latter days, to scrutinise Stalin&#8217;s 
credentials as a Marxist theoretician. The present point is to note an identical 
reification of historical process in both Smelser and in Stalin, entailed in the 
premises and extending into the vocabulary of analysis: both offer (or pretend 
to offer) history as a &#8216;process without a subject&#8217;, both concur in the eviction 
from history of human agency (unless as the &#8216;supports&#8217; or vectors of ulterior 
structural determinations), both present human consciousness and practices as 
self-motivated <i>things</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">There is a further point. The explicit concept of history as &#8216;a 
process without a subject&#8217; is a discovery not of Smelser or of Stalin but of 
Althusser; and, moreover, he proposed that this is &#8216;the basis of all the 
analyses in <i>Capital</i> (L. <i>&amp; P.,</i> 117; <i>P. &amp; A.,</i> 182-5; <i>
Essays,</i> 51). But we may surmise that the origin of this remarkable insight 
lay in Stalin&#8217;s <i>Marxism and Linguistics</i>, a text for which Althusser has 
always shown unusual respect. We know that Althusser joined the French Communist 
Party in 1948, and felt himself to be, subjectively, confronting a great 
difficulty:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;A professional philosopher who joins the Party remains, 
ideologically, a petty bourgeois. He must revolutionize his thought in order to 
occupy a proletarian class position in philosophy.&quot; (<i>L. &amp; P. 17)</i></p>

<p class="fst">In this difficulty, he cut his teeth on Stalin&#8217;s 'original&#8217; 
contribution to theory (1950) which provided the 'first shock&#8217; which began to 
dislodge the sectarianism and dogmatism which characterised the Communist 
movement at his initiation. Or so he presents the event in retrospect - a 
&#8216;period summed up in caricature by a single phrase, a banner flapping in the 
void: &#8220;bourgeois science, proletarian science&#8221;.&#8217;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Paradoxically, it was no other than Stalin, whose contagious 
and implacable system of government and thought had induced this delirium, who 
reduced the madness to a little more reason. Reading between the lines of the 
few simple pages in which he reproached the zeal of those who were making 
strenuous efforts to prove language a superstructure, we could see that there 
were limits to the use of the class criterion, and that we had been made to 
treat science, a status claimed by every page of Marx, as merely the first-comer 
among ideologies. We had to retreat, and, in semi-disarray, return to first 
principles. . . &#8221; (<i>P.M.,</i> 22, 27)<a href="#n88" name="fn88" target="_self">[88]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is thus that he presents his own intellectual development: a 
'petty bourgeois&#8217;, initiated into Stalinist dogmatism, but rescued from its 
uttermost delirium - by Stalin. The rescue-operation left him, precisely, with 
the immanent concept of history as &#8216;process without a subject&#8217;, with a reified 
structuralist vocabulary, with an inexorable and mechanical metaphor of basis 
and superstructure - and with a notion of Marxism as a &#8216;science&#8217; which belonged 
to neither!</p>

<p class="fst">Althusser has, of course, subsequent to <i>Reading Capital</i>, 
denied that his version of Marxism is a structuralism, even though he allows 
that &#8216;the young pup . . . slipped between my legs,&#8217;<a href="#n89" name="fn89" target="_self">[89]</a> 
The argument, which turns largely upon certain structuralist notions of the 
&#8216;combinatory&#8217;, is not one which we intend to address. Instead, we will address 
directly his own text, its vocabulary, its premises and terms.</p>

<p class="fst">The critical concept of Althusserian sociological theory is that 
of a &#8216;mode of production.&#8217; Few Marxists will object to this. We think, if we are 
historians, of - <i>production</i>: and of land, dues, rents, property, 
technologies, markets, capital, wages, and the like. But Althusser assumes all 
this and posts forward to the essence of the matter, the concept, the 
&#8216;arrangement&#8217; of the &#8216;terms&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;On the one hand, the <i>structure</i> (the economic base: the 
forces of production and the relations of production); on the other, the <i>
superstructure</i> (the State and all the legal, political and ideological 
forms).&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">So far, we have been guided by the firm hand of Stalin. But now 
we may improve upon him. Marx introduced &#8216;a <i>new conception</i> of the 
relation between <i>determinant instances in</i> the structure - super structure 
complex which constitutes the essence of any social formation.&#8217; (<i>F.M.S</i> 
111) Althusser then throws himself into the posture of wrestling for the purity 
of Marxist science against four antagonists - <i>&#8216;economism</i> and even <i>
technologism&#8217;</i> (<i>F.M.,</i> 108), on one side, humanism and historicism on 
the other. The relation between basis and superstructure must be verbalised and 
sophisticated in new ways, introducing the concepts of structure-in-dominance, 
in-the-last-instance determination, and over-determination. Marx gives us &#8216;two 
ends of the chain&#8217;: &#8216;on the one hand, <i>determination in the last instance by 
the (economic) mode of production;</i> on the other, <i>the relative autonomy of 
the superstructure and their specific effectivity.&#8217;</i> (<i>EM.</i> 111) 
(Strictly speaking, these are not two ends of a chain, but two ways of saying 
the same thing, for what is determinant, but only in the last instance, must 
allow for the effectivity of other relatively autonomous effects in other 
instances.) But, Althusser assures us, this determination, while ever-present, 
is only Active, since &#8216;from the first moment to the last, the lonely hour of the 
&#8220;last instance&#8221; never comes.&#8217; (<i>EM.</i> 113) The problem, then, which, to a 
historian, might appear to require further empirical investigation and 
elaboration, appears to Althusser as one which arises from the deficiency of <i>
'the theory of the specific effectivity of the superstructures</i> . . (<i>EM.</i> 
113) This he sets out to repair: &#8216;and before the theory of their effectivity or 
simultaneously (for it is by formulating their effectivity that their <i>essence</i> 
can be attained) there must be elaboration of <i>the theory of the particular 
essence of the specific elements of the superstructure</i> (<i>EM.</i> 114)</p>

<p class="fst">One feels that &#8216;formulations&#8217; of this order, which repeatedly 
attain to the dignity and special clarity of italics, must indeed prepare us for 
the unveiling of mystery. Nor are we disappointed. For we are introduced to a 
very great lady, who is not at all to be seen as a slender superstructure 
sitting on a somewhat large basis, but as a unitary figure, <i>La Structure a 
Dominante.</i> She is a &#8216;totality&#8217;, but not a spurious Hegelian or Sartreian 
totality: she is infinitely more &#8216;definite and rigorous. (<i>F.M.</i> 203) What 
determines her existence and structures her dominant personality is, in the last 
instance, &#8216;economic&#8217;; but since the last instance never arrives, it is courteous 
very often to overlook this material determination. It is impolite to keep on 
reminding a great lady that she is determined by her tummy. It is more helpful 
to characterise her by the contradictions in her temperament, and to examine 
these contradictions in their own right, instead of continually harping on the 
fact that they originate in a bad digestion.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If every contradiction is a contradiction in a complex whole 
structured in dominance, this complex whole cannot be envisaged without its 
contradictions, without their basically uneven relations. In other words, each 
contradiction, each essential articulation of the structure, and the general 
relation of the articulations in the structure in dominance, constitute so many 
conditions of the existence of the complex whole itself. This proposition is of 
the first importance. For it means that the structure of the whole and therefore 
the 'difference&#8217; of the essential contradictions and their structure in 
dominance, is the very existence of the whole; that the &#8216;difference&#8217; of the 
contradictions ... is identical to the conditions of the existence of the 
complex whole. In plain terms this position implies that the &#8216;secondary&#8217; 
contradictions are not the pure phenomena of the &#8216;principal&#8217; contradiction, that 
the principal is not the essence and the secondaries so many of its phenomena, 
so much so that the principal contradiction might practically exist <i>without</i> 
the secondary contradictions, or without some of them, or might exist <i>before</i> 
or <i>after</i> them. On the contrary, it implies that the secondary 
contradictions are essential even to the existence of the principal 
contradiction, that they really constitute its condition of existence, just as 
the principal contradiction constitutes their condition of existence. As an 
example, take the complex structured whole that is society.&quot; (<i>F.M.</i> 204-5)</p>

<p class="fst">Ah, yes. Let us take an example, even if a trivial one: 
&#8216;society&#8217;. For &#8216;in plain terms&#8217; we had even supposed that Althusser was going a 
long and windy way around to say that in any complex whole or organism all 
attributes must be taken together as one set; and if analysis identifies a 
&#8216;principal contradiction&#8217; this is (a) inherent to its structure, and (b) does 
not thereby disallow subordinate contradictions. But &#8216;society&#8217;, it turns out, 
can be more rapidly despatched:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In it, the &#8216;relations of production&#8217; are not the pure 
phenomena of the forces of production; they are also their condition of 
existence. The superstructure is not the pure phenomenon of the structure, it is 
also its condition of existence . . . Please do not misunderstand me: this 
mutual conditioning of the existence of the &#8220;contradictions&#8221; does not nullify 
the structure in dominance that reigns over the contradictions and in them (in 
this case, determination in the last instance by the economy). Despite its 
apparent circularity, this conditioning does not result in the destruction of 
the structure in domination that constitutes the complexity of the whole, and 
its unity. Quite the contrary, even within the reality of the conditions of 
existence of each contradiction, it is the manifestation of the structure in 
dominance that unifies the whole. <i>This reflection of the conditions of 
existence of the contradiction within itself, this reflection of the structure 
articulated in dominance that constitutes the unity of the complex whole within 
each contradiction</i>, this is the most profound characteristic of the Marxist 
dialectic, the one I have tried recently to encapsulate in the concept of <i>
&#8216;over-determination'</i>&#8217;<i>.&quot;</i> (<i>F.M</i>. 205-6)</p>

<p class="fst">It is good to know that we have arrived at length at &#8216;the most 
profound characteristic of the Marxist dialectic&#8217;; although we have arrived by 
Althusser&#8217;s characteristic idealist methods - from ideal premises we arrive at 
&#8216;society&#8217;, as an example! This reorganisation of vocabulary has been forced upon 
Althusser by the deficiencies of &#8216;economism&#8217;, which sees the relation between 
basis and superstructure in an analogy with clockwork mechanism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is &#8216;<i>economism</i>&#8217; (mechanism) and not the true Marxist 
tradition that sets up the hierarchy of instances once and for all, assigns each 
its essence and role and defines the universal meaning of their relations . . . 
It is economism that identifies eternally in advance the 
determinant-contradiction-in-the-last-instance with the <i>role</i> of the 
dominant contradiction, which for ever assimilates such and such an &#8220;aspect&#8221; 
(forces of production, economy, practice) to the principal <i>role,</i> and such 
and such another &#8216;aspect&#8217; (relations of production, politics, ideology, theory) 
to the secondary <i>role</i> - whereas in real history determination in the last 
instance by the economy is exercised precisely in the permutations of the 
principal role between the economy, politics, theory, etc.&quot; (F.A1 213)</p>

<p class="fst">The concession as to &#8216;real history&#8217; is welcome (and unusual) 
although practising historians can scarcely find the resolution at the end of 
that sentence to be enlightening. What Althusser appears to be saying is that 
&#8216;economism&#8217; proposed a clockwork analogy which was both crude and disreputable: 
and he proposes instead to sophisticate the clockwork:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Unevenness is internal to a social formation because the 
structuration in dominance of the complex whole, this structural invariant, <i>
is itself the precondition for the concrete variation of the contradictions</i> 
that constitute it, and therefore for their displacements, condensations and 
mutations, etc., and inversely because <i>this variation is the existence of 
that invariant.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Uneven development &#8216;is not external to contradiction, but 
constitutes its most intimate essence.&#8217; <i>'</i>(<i>EM.</i> 213) All this 
certainly sounds more reputable; we have got rid of Stalin&#8217;s grandfather clock, 
which was increasingly coming to look like a rather ugly antique. But what we 
are left with is simply a new-styled, more complicated clock, with many more 
moving parts, and these parts are not substantial components, derived from 
historical investigation (monetary systems, constitutions, norms, 
property-rights), but interpolated neologisms. The reorganisation has taken 
place, not in substantive analysis (theory interacting with enquiry), but in the 
vocabulary alone.</p>

<p class="fst">The reason why we are still left with clockwork (or philosophical <i>
mechanism</i>) lies in the theory&#8217;s character: as a structuralism. Very clearly, 
Althusser&#8217;s system is more than a &#8216;flirtation&#8217; with structuralist terms. It does 
not matter at all whether or not this system qualifies as a structuralism 
according to certain recent Parisian notations in linguistics, anthropology or 
psycho-analysis. What constitutes a structuralism, in a more general sense, is 
(i) that however many variables are introduced, and however complex their 
permutations, these variables maintain their original fixity as categories: with 
Smelser, the &#8216;value-system&#8217;, the factors of production, &#8216;political 
arrangements', and (the motor) &#8216;structural differentiation&#8217;; with Althusser, 
&#8216;the economy&#8217;, &#8216;politics&#8217;, &#8216;ideology&#8217;, and (the motor) &#8216;class struggle.&#8217; Thus 
the categories are <i>categories of stasis</i>, even if they are then set in 
motion as moving-parts. (ii) Movement can only take place <i>within the closed 
field</i> of the system or structure; that is, however complex and 
mutually-reciprocating the motions of the parts, this movement is enclosed 
within the overall limits and determinations of the pre-given structure. For 
both these reasons, history <i>as process</i>, as open-ended and indeterminate 
eventuation - but not for that reason devoid of rational <i>logic</i> or of 
determining <i>pressures</i> - in which categories are defined in particular 
contexts but are continuously undergoing historical redefinition, and whose 
structure is not pre-given but protean, continually changing in form and in 
articulation - all this (which may be said to constitute far more truly &#8216;the 
most profound characteristic of the Marxist dialectic&#8217;) must be denied.</p>

<p class="fst">And we face here a very difficult problem, and a problem 
insuperable to those philosophers (or sociologists) who suppose that a 
&#8216;formulation&#8217; is at a higher level than &#8216;empirical&#8217; analysis, and that what is 
requisite is not theoretically-informed <i>knowledge</i> but a &#8216;theory of 
history&#8217; For it is exceptionally difficult to verbalise as &#8216;theory&#8217; history as 
process; and, in particular, no analogies derived from mechanical or organic 
mechanism, and no static structural reconstitution, can encompass the logic of 
indeterminate historical process, a process which remains subject to determinate 
pressures. In the last analysis, the logic of process can only be described in 
terms of historical analysis; no analogy derived from any other area can have 
any more than a limited, illustrative, metaphoric value (and often, as with 
basis and superstructure, a static and damaging one); &#8216;history&#8217; may only be 
theorised in terms of its own properties. We may well agree that historical 
materialism should become more theoretically alert, both as to its procedures 
and its conclusions. But what requires interrogating and theorising is 
historical knowledge.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h11">xi</a></h3>

<p class="fst">We have by no means finished with the problem of structure and of 
process, nor with our commentary upon Althusser&#8217;s propositions. But we may at 
this point attempt to view this problem in a different perspective, by stepping 
behind both Althusser and Marx, and situating ourselves in eighteenth-century 
Naples, with Giambattista Vico.</p>

<p class="fst">The concept of history as process raises at once the questions of 
intelligibility and intention. Each historical event is unique. But many events, 
widely separated in time and place, reveal, when brought into relation with each 
other, regularities of process. Vico, confronted with these regularities, 
struggled to define process in ways which foresaw simultaneously the 
anthropological discipline and historical materialism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;He proceeds to discuss the natural law of the peoples, and 
show at what certain times and in what determinate ways the customs were born 
that constitute the entire economy of this law. These are religions, languages, 
property rights, business transactions, orders, empires, laws, arms, trials, 
penalties, wars, peaces and alliances. And from the times and ways in which they 
were born he infers the eternal properties which determine that the nature of 
each, that is the time and way of its origin, shall be such and not otherwise.&#8221;<a href="#n90" name="fn90" target="_self">[90]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Vico was able, in a remarkable way, to hold in simultaneous 
suspension, without manifest contradiction, a Hegelian, a Marxist, and a 
structuralist (Levi-Straussian variant) heuristic. With Hegel he described &#8216;an 
ideal eternal history traversed in time by the history of every nation: &#8216;Uniform 
ideas originating among entire peoples unknown to each other must have a common 
ground of truth.&#8217; From one aspect, this uniformity can be seen as evidence of 
&quot;divine providence.&#8217; But this providence works its way out through naturalistic 
means: &#8216;our Science proceeds by a severe analysis of human thoughts about the 
human necessities or utilities of social life, which are the two perennial 
springs of the natural law of nations&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Human choice, by its nature most uncertain, is made certain 
and determined by the common sense of men with respect to human needs or 
utilities . . .&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">And &#8216;common sense&#8217; is &#8216;judgement without reflection, shared by an 
entire class, an entire people, an entire nation, or the whole human race.&#8217; 
Hence from another aspect providence may be seen as necessity, human needs or 
utilities determining social consciousness in uniform ways. But the uniformity 
of this &#8216;judgement without reflection&#8217; implies also a uniformity of mental 
structure:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The natural law of nations is coeval with the customs of the 
nations, conforming one with another in virtue of a common human sense . . .&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">And:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There must in the nature of human things be a mental language 
common to all nations, which uniformly grasps the substance of things feasible 
in human social life . . .&#8221;<a href="#n91" name="fn91" target="_self">[91]</a></p>

<p class="fst">So that, from a third aspect, we encounter the notion of a 
&#8216;common mental language&#8217; and common structure of myth.</p>

<p class="fst">Since this mental language was given to man by divine providence, 
the circle of argument is closed.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus Vico is offering us history as a process <i>with</i> a 
subject, but this need not necessarily be a historicism. If &#8216;divine providence&#8217; 
is taken as the subject (or as the ultimate directive agent) and humanity as 
vectors of divine will, then of course we are offered a historicist theology. 
But since this providence is worked out through natural determinations, then men 
and women can be seen to be the subjects or agents of their own history. And the 
ambiguity of Vico&#8217;s term as usually translated as &#8216;law&#8217; (&#8216;the natural law of 
nations&#8217;, <i>diritto naturale delle gente</i>) has haunted historical 
materialism from this time forward. If we employ &#8216;law&#8217; so as to entail 
pre-determination and prediction, we are open to 700 objections, some 650 of 
which have been patiently expounded by Sir Karl Popper. It is futile to deny 
that both Marx and Engels did, on occasion, employ &#8216;law&#8217; in this sense; and when 
they do so, the objections may sometimes be upheld.<a href="#n92" name="fn92" target="_self">[92]</a> 
But of course <i>law, droit</i>, <i>diritto</i>, are words with many infexions 
and ambiguities of meaning, in a set which moves from <i>rule</i> by way of <i>
regularity</i> to <i>direction.</i> Historical materialism, from the time of 
Vico, has been in search for a term which addresses the uniformities of customs, 
etc., the regularities of social formations, and analyses these not as lawed 
necessities nor as fortuitous coincidences but as shaping and directive 
pressures, indicative articulations of human practices. I have already suggested 
that the argument will be advanced if we discard the concept of &#8216;law&#8217; and 
replace it with that of &#8216;the logic of process.&#8217;<a href="#n93" name="fn93" target="_self">[93]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is Vico&#8217;s insight into this logic which sustains his position 
as a precursor of historical materialism. He saw clearly that the historical 
event is something quite distinct from the sum of individual goals and 
intentions:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is true that men. have themselves made this world of 
nations . . but this world without doubt has issued from a mind often diverse, 
at times quite contrary, and always superior to the particular ends that men had 
proposed to themselves; which narrow ends, made means to serve wider ends, it 
has always employed to preserve the human race upon this earth. Men mean to 
gratify their bestial lust and abandon their offspring, and they inaugurate the 
chastity of marriage from which the families arise. The fathers mean to exercise 
without restraint their paternal power over their clients, and they subject them 
to the civil powers from which the cities arise. The reigning orders of nobles 
mean to abuse their lordly freedom over the plebians, and they are obliged to 
submit to the laws which establish popular liberty. The free peoples mean to 
shake off the yoke of their laws, and they become subject to monarchs . . . That 
which did all this was mind, for men did it with intelligence; it was not fate, 
for they did it by choice; not chance, for the results of their always so acting 
are perpetually the same.&#8221;<a href="#n94" name="fn94" target="_self">[94]</a></p>

<p class="fst">I am directing attention not to Vico&#8217;s own attempt to attribute 
to process a cyclical intelligibility, but to his superb expression of process. 
This is the point from which all sustained historical thought must start. It is 
to this point that Engels returned in his famous (perhaps one should say 
&#8216;notorious&#8217;, in view of Althusser&#8217;s heavy-handed treatment of it)<a href="#n95" name="fn95" target="_self">[95]</a> 
letter to Bloch of September 1890: &#8216;We make our own history, but in the first 
place under very definite presuppositions and conditions. Among these the 
economic ones are finally decisive . . .&#8217; How, then, can we be said to &#8216;make our 
own history&#8217; if &#8216;the economic movement finally asserts itself as necessary&#8217;? In 
proposing a solution, Engels quietly exchanges subjects, and replaces &#8216;we make&#8217; 
with &#8216;history makes itself&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;History makes itself in such a way that the final result 
always arises from conflicts between many individual wills, of which each again 
has been made what it is by a host of particular conditions of life, Thus there 
are innumerable intersecting forces, an infinite parallelogram of forces which 
give rise to one resultant - the historical event. This again may itself be 
viewed as the product of a power which, taken as a whole, works <i>unconsciously</i> 
and without volition. For what each individual wills is obstructed by everyone 
else, and what emerges is something that no one willed. Thus past history 
proceeds in the manner of a natural process and is also essentially subject to 
the same laws of movement.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">And in his conclusion, Engels attempts to bring the two 
alternative subjects into relationship. &#8216;Individual wills&#8217; (i.e. &#8216;we&#8217;) &#8216;do not 
attain what they want, but are merged into a collective mean, a common 
resultant,&#8217; and yet &#8216;each contributes to the resultant and is to this degree 
involved in it.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Althusser has no patience with this &#8216;whole futile construction&#8217; (<i>EM.</i> 
121), which in some part of his critique he patently misreads.<a href="#n96" name="fn96" target="_self">[96]</a> 
But with other parts of his critique I find myself in unfamiliar agreement. I 
would phrase my objections rather differently, but at points we concur. 1) 
Engels has not offered a solution to the problem, but re-stated it in new terms. 
He has commenced with the proposition that economic presuppositions are &#8216;finally 
decisive&#8217;, and this is where he concludes. 2), On the way he has gathered in an 
infinitude of &#8216;individual wills&#8217; whose agency, in the result, is cancelled out 
(&#8216;something that no one willed&#8217;). 3) The model of &#8216;an infinite parallelogram of 
forces&#8217;, derived from physics, obscures what it should clarify. 4) In adopting 
this model Engels has unconsciously fallen back upon &#8216;the presuppositions of 
classical bourgeois ideology and bourgeois political economy&#8217; (<i>EM.</i> 124) - 
Adam Smith&#8217;s sum of self-interest, Rousseau&#8217;s general will.<a href="#n97" name="fn97" target="_self">[97]</a> 
But the historical &#8216;resultant&#8217; cannot usefully be conceived as the involuntary 
product of the sum of an infinity of mutually-contradictory individual 
volitions, since these &#8216;individual wills&#8217; are not destructured atoms in 
collision but act with, upon, and against each other as <i>grouped</i> &#8216;wills&#8217; - 
as families, communities, interests, and, above all, as classes. In this sense, 
Vico, who proposes not &#8216;individual wills&#8217; but fathers/clients, nobles/plebians, 
free peoples/monarchs, has stated the problem of process better than Engels. And 
if Engels, in this hurried letter, had remembered his own thinking and writing 
on all this, then he would have offered not a re-statement of the problem but 
some indication of a resolution. For these &#8216;individual wills&#8217;, however 
&#8216;particular&#8217; their &#8216;conditions of life&#8217;, have been conditioned in class ways; 
and if the historical resultant is then seen as the outcome of a collision of 
contradictory class interests and forces, then we may see how human agency gives 
rise to an involuntary result - &#8216;the economic movement finally asserts itself as 
necessary&#8217; - and how we may say, at one and the same time, that &#8216;we make our own 
history&#8217; and &#8216;history makes itself.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">I have, in these last sentences, departed a very long way from 
Althusser. We shall see how far in a moment. One or two of our local criticisms 
of the text are concurrent. But Althusser sees the whole construction as 
&#8216;futile&#8217;, because Engels has proposed a non-problem: if the &#8216;economic movement&#8217; 
produces the historical result, then we should get on with the analysis of 
structures and dismiss &#8216;individual wills.&#8217; The very notion of human agency is no 
more than &#8216;the semblance of a problem for <i>bourgeois ideology</i> (<i>EM.</i> 
126) I, on the contrary, consider that Engels has proposed a very critical 
problem (agency and process) and that, despite deficiencies, the general 
tendency of his meditation is helpful. At least he does not discount the crucial 
ambivalence of our human presence in our own history, part-subjects, 
part-objects, the voluntary agents of our own involuntary determinations. Four 
years before Engels wrote to Bloch, an English Communist had reflected upon the 
same problem, in his own very different idiom:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I pondered ail these things, and how men fight and lose the 
battle, and the thing that they fought for comes about in spite of their defeat, 
and when it comes turns out not to be what they meant, and other men have to 
fight for what they meant under another name . . .&#8221;<a href="#n98" name="fn98" target="_self">[98]</a></p>

<p class="fst">For William Morris the accent falls even more sharply upon 
agency; but men are seen as the ever-baffled and ever-resurgent agents of an 
unmastered history.</p>

<p class="fst">Since process ensued in regularities which did not conform to the 
actors&#8217; intentions, Vico saw history as issuing &#8216;from a mind . . . always 
superior to the particular ends that men have proposed to themselves.&#8217; Engels 
was reduced to a metaphor which introduced analogies from positivist law: &#8216;the 
historical event. . . may itself be viewed as the product of a power which . . . 
works unconsciously&#8217; (a reminder of Vico&#8217;s divine providence); but, also, 
&#8216;history makes itself&#8217; and &#8216;proceeds in the manner of a natural process&#8217; (a 
reminder of Vico&#8217;s necessity of &#8216;human needs or utilities&#8217;). It is manifest 
that, when we say that history is not only process but process with intelligible 
regularities and forms, the mind finds it difficult to resist the conclusion 
that history must therefore be <i>programmed</i> in some way (whether the 
programming be divine or &#8216;natural&#8217;); and, again and again, we notice the 
attribution of extra-historical or teleological sequences and goals - goals to 
which process is seen to move <i>towards</i>: &#8216;issuing from a mind&#8217;, &#8216;the 
product of a power&#8217;, the realisation of a <i>potentia</i> immanent within the 
essence or at the origin of the process, which manifests itself in the 
&#8216;development of forms.&#8217;<a href="#n99" name="fn99" target="_self">[99]</a> This 
attribution can certainly be resisted, and it is <i>not</i> entailed in the 
premises of process and of social formations. But neither Vico nor Engels 
succeeded always in resisting it; nor did Marx (in his &#8216;<i>Grundrisse</i> 
face&#8217;); nor, very certainly, does Althusser, despite his repeated polemics 
against &#8216;historicism.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Althusser&#8217;s preferred solution is in two parts. First, he evicts 
human agency from history, which then becomes a &#8216;process without a subject.&#8217; 
Human events <i>are</i> the process but human practice (and, still less, 
intentions, &#8216;wills&#8217;) contributes nothing to this process. So far from being 
original, this is a very ancient mode of thought: process is fate. But if a 
human process without a (human) subject appears, nevertheless, to be not wholly 
fortuitous - a mere outcome of random collisions - but to be shaped and 
patterned in ways intelligible to humans, then, by an equally ancient mode of 
thought, it must be seen as being <i>willed</i>, being subject to some 
extra-human compulsion: Providence, the Divine Will, the Idea, evolutionary 
Destiny, Necessity.</p>

<p class="fst">Althusser wishes to expel such teleologies (&#8216;historicism&#8217;). So, 
in his second part, he evicts process from history. Rather like a medieval 
emblem of Death, he leans over history&#8217;s death-bed, operates on the prone body, 
and liberates its soul. After this surgical parturition, under the knife of 
&#8216;theoretical practice&#8217;, history reappears in two forms. Form 1: an infinity (a 
&#8216;bad infinity&#8217;) of human events and collisions of human wills, which, however, 
since they are formless, <i>are not 'historical\</i> Events turn out to be 
non-events. For &#8216;what makes <i>such and such</i> an event <i>historical</i> is 
not the fact that it is an <i>event,</i> but precisely its <i>insertion into 
forms which are themselves historical</i>. . (<i>EM.</i> 126) Whatever cannot be 
inserted into these forms are unhappenings (historically), and very much of the 
inert body of history turns out to be composed of such. Form 1 can now be 
dismissed, and hurriedly, for the body is corrupting even before it is interred. 
Form 2 of history is its soul. But what can this soul be, if it is not events, 
unless it be those forms which guarantee that an event is truly &#8216;historical&#8217;? A 
historical fact is &#8216;<i>a fact which causes a mutation in the existing structural 
relations&#8217;</i> (<i>R.C.</i> 102) Process turns out to be, not historical process 
at all (this wretched soul has been incarnated in the wrong body) but the 
structural articulation of social and economic formations, as Smelser and others 
had long supposed. Form 2, the soul, must therefore quickly be re-incarnated in 
a more theoretically-hygienic body The soul of process must be arrested in its 
flight and thrust into the marble statue of structural immobilism: and there she 
sits, the gracious lady whom we have already met, <i>La Structure a Dominante.</i></p>

<p class="fst">This is not one of Althusser&#8217;s more elegant passages of argument. 
At a first, &#8216;common sense&#8217; reading it might pass. After all, if I get up from my 
desk (as I will do shortly), to take the darned dog for a walk, this is scarcely 
an &#8216;historical&#8217; event. So that what makes events historical must be defined in 
some other way. But historical events remain <i>events</i> even after we have 
made a theoretical selection; theory does not reduce events to structures; even 
when we have defined out innumerable events as of negligible interest to 
historical analysis, what we must analyse remains as a process of eventuation. 
Indeed, it is exactiy the significance of the event to this process which 
affords the criterion for selection. Nor is there any guarantee against 
teleology - as Althusser appears to suppose - in reducing process to stasis. It 
was the old error of mechanical materialism - and also of analogies from 
&#8216;natural process&#8217; brought to bear upon human affairs - to suppose that a clock 
is a clock is a clock. But on closer inspection, ideological clock-makers have 
been identified, and goals have been found - not only at the terminus of process 
- but planted in the automatic motions of clocks. For if a mode of production is 
proposed to entail a regular and rational form of sequential development, and a 
complex (but uniform) internal relational structuration, <i>independent of the 
rationality and agency of the human actors who in fact produce and relate</i>, 
then, very soon, the questions will be asked: whose is the divine will which 
programmed this automating structure, where is the ulterior &#8216;unconscious power&#8217;?</p>

<p class="fst">Perhaps Althusser was aware of the tawdry texture of this 
argument in <i>For Marx.</i> For in subsequent writings he has returned, with 
increasing obsessiveness, to these two evictions from history: the eviction of 
human agency, the eviction of historical time, or process. I have presented 
these two propositions in sequence, but in fact they arise in his theory 
simultaneously. We will consider first his elevated disquisition on historical 
time in <i>Reading Capital.</i></p>

<p class="fst">This is difficult for a historian to handle with patience. It is 
composed, in about equal parts, of banalities, of elaborate verbalisations which 
offer no purchase whatsoever for actual historical analysis, and of ridiculous 
errors. The banalities are composed of polemics against antagonists of straw, 
and pompous observations directed towards historians (to &#8216;draw their attention 
to empiricist ideology which, with a few exceptions, overwhelmingly dominates 
every variety of history&#8217; (<i>R.C.</i> 109) ) as to matters which have been the 
object of advanced historical investigation for decades. The best that we can 
say of these observations is that they served the purpose of revealing 
Althusser&#8217;s ignorance of historiography in his own country (as, Marc Bloch&#8217;s 
comparative methods, Braudel&#8217;s reflections on historical time).<a href="#n100" name="fn100" target="_self">[100]</a> 
The kindest thing that can be said is that one or two of the problems which he 
gestures towards had been formulated long before in historical practice; how 
else could British and French historians exchange views on 'the bourgeois 
revolution&#8217;, British and Indian historians bring into a common discourse 
&#8216;medieval&#8217; societies governed by Plantaganets and Moghuls, American and Japanese 
historians exchange knowledge on the differential developments of industrial 
revolutions, without this being so? The worst that can be said is that, once 
again, Althusser announces, as original and rigorous Marxist theory, notions 
disintegrative of the full historical process, notions highly regarded within 
bourgeois historiography (notably in the United States) - as in certain forms of 
comparative history, development theory, and modernization theory: theories 
supported by an elaborated armoury of positivistic methodology. As so often 
before, Althusser has been arrested by bourgeois concepts and taken for a 
bourgeois ride; he seeks, not to transform these concepts, but to convert their 
vocabulary.</p>

<p class="fst">The verbalisations and the errors we can take together.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We must grasp in all its rigour the absolute necessity of 
liberating the theory of history&quot; from any compromise with &#8216;empirical&#8217; 
temporality, with the ideological concept of time which underlies and overlies 
it, or with the ideological idea that the theory of history, <i>as theory</i> 
could be subject to the &#8216;concrete&#8217; determinations of &#8216;historical time&#8217; . . .&quot; (<i>R. 
C.</i> 105)</p>

<p class="fst">In what does this &#8216;liberation&#8217; consist? It consists, precisely, 
in displacing process by structure. More strictly, structures (modes of 
production, social formations) do not eventuate and undergo transformations 
within the larger historical process. Structure, like a whale, opens its jaws, 
and swallows process up: thereafter, process survives unhappily in structure&#8217;s 
stomach. To do this trick of theoretical practice, it is necessary to redefine 
synchrony and diachrony. Structure cannot be disclosed by synchronic procedures 
(in their customary sense): for example, by freezing &#8216;history' into a momentary 
pose, taking a &#8216;section&#8217; at a moment of stasis, analysing the articulation of a 
&#8216;totality&#8217;. For (swallowed) process is inscribed within structure, and survives 
as the development of that structure&#8217;s forms. Not only does structure have a 
developmental progression (vestigial process) but it is articulated with great 
complexity and characterised by uneven development.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I have shown<a href="#n101" name="fn101" target="_self">[101]</a> 
that in order to conceive this &#8216;dominance&#8217; of a structure over the other 
structures in the unity of a conjuncture it is necessary to refer to the 
principle of the determination &#8216;in the last instance&#8217; of the non-economic 
structures by the economic structure; and that this &#8216;determination in the last 
instance&#8217; is an absolute precondition for the necessity and intelligibility of 
the displacements of structures in the hierarchy of effectivity, or of the 
displacement of &#8216;dominance&#8217; between the structured levels of the whole . . .&quot; (<i>R.C.</i> 
99)</p>

<p class="fst">But at any particular &#8216;conjuncture&#8217;, when we might choose to 
arrest history or take a &#8216;section&#8217;, the &#8216;last instance&#8217; (which, we remember, 
never arrives) is not likely to be around. This kind of synchrony, which looks 
for a simultaneous instant of &#8216;totality&#8217;, will misread the evidence. Moreover, 
most of the other &#8216;instances&#8217; or &#8216;levels&#8217; of the structure will present 
themselves improperly, since they are all motoring around on different 
schedules:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We can argue from the specific structure of the Marxist whole 
that it is no longer possible to think the process of the development of the 
different levels of the whole <i>in the same historical time.</i> Each of these 
different levels does not have the same type of historical existence. On the 
contrary, we have to assign to each level a <i>peculiar time</i>, relatively 
autonomous and hence relatively independent., even in its dependence, of the 
&#8220;times&#8221; of the other levels. We can and must say: for each mode of production 
there is a peculiar time and history, punctuated in a specific way by the 
development of the productive forces; the relations of production have their 
peculiar time and history, punctuated in a specific way; the political 
superstructure has its own history . . .; philosophy has its own time and 
history . . .; aesthetic productions . . . scientific formations ... etc. Each 
of these peculiar histories is punctuated with peculiar rhythms and can only be 
known on condition that we have defined the <i>concept</i> of the specificity of 
its historical temporarily and its punctuations (continuous development, 
revolutions, breaks, etc.) The fact that each of these times and each of these 
histories is <i>relatively autonomous</i> does not make them so many domains 
which are <i>independent</i> of the whole: the specificity of each of these 
times and each of these histories - in other words, their relative autonomy and 
independence - is based on a certain type of articulation in the whole, and 
therefore on a certain type of <i>dependence</i> with respect to the whole . . 
.&quot; (<i>R.C.</i> 99-100)</p>

<p class="fst">And so we drone on, as we may well do, for the possible 
permutations of&#8216;structure&#8217;, &#8216;levels&#8217;, &#8216;instances&#8217;, &#8216;last instances&#8217;, &#8216;relative 
autonomy&#8217;, &#8216;specificity&#8217;, &#8216;peculiar', and &#8216;articul-ation&#8217; are inexhaustible: 
&#8216;the mode and degree of <i>independence</i> of each time and history is 
therefore necessarily determined by the mode and degree of <i>dependence</i> of 
each level within the set of articulations of the whole.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">The point is, that the customary (&#8216;ideological&#8217;) notion of 
synchrony is likely to overlook all this. Nor can we even take a ragged, 
temporarily-slantwise &#8216;section&#8217; of the structure, since while this might give us 
an indication of the hierarchy of &#8216;levels&#8217; (and in fact Althusser is always 
giving us vaporous verbal &#8216;sections' of this kind), it will not show us the 
operative principles of dominance and development. We must be enabled to &#8216;think, 
in its peculiar articulation, the <i>function</i> of such an element or such a 
level in the current configuration of the whole.&#8217; The task is:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;To determine the relation of articulation of .this element as 
a function of other elements, of this structure as a function of other 
structures, it obliges us to define what has been called its <i>
overdetermination</i> or <i>underdetermination</i> as a function of the 
structure of the determination of the whole, it obliges us to define what might 
be called, in another language, the <i>index of determination,</i> the <i>index 
of effectivity</i> currently attributable to the element or structure in 
question in the general structure of the whole. By <i>index of effectivity</i> 
we may understand the character of more or less dominant or subordinate and 
therefore more or less &#8216;paradoxical&#8217; determination of a given element or 
structure in the current mechanism of the whole. And this is nothing but the 
theory of the conjuncture indispensable to the theory of history.</p>

<p class="quoteb">I do not want to go any further with this analysis, although 
it has still hardly been elaborated at all.&quot; (<i>R.C.</i> 106-7)</p>

<p class="fst">This is wise, because the &#8216;theory of the conjuncture&#8217;, which is 
&#8216;indispensable&#8217; but which is nowhere elaborated, would not appear to be a 
&#8216;theory&#8217; at all, but an exalted way of saying &#8216;Now&#8217;. But &#8216;now&#8217; (Whether today&#8217;s 
&#8216;now&#8217; or some moment of &#8216;now&#8217; in the past) may also be seen as synchronic 
knowledge:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The synchronic is then nothing but <i>the conception</i> of 
the specific relations that exist between the different elements and the 
different structures of the structure of the whole, it is the <i>knowledge</i> 
of the relations of dependence and articulation which makes it an organic whole, 
a system. <i>The synchronic is eternity in Spinoza's sense,</i> or the adequate 
knowledge of a complex object by the adequate knowledge of its complexity. This 
is exactly what Marx is distinguishing from the concrete-real historical 
sequence in the words: &#8216;How, indeed, could the single logical formula of 
movement, of sequence, of time, explain the body of society, in which all 
economic relations co-exist simultaneously and support one another?&#8217; &quot; (<i>Poverty 
of Philosophy</i>). (<i>R.C</i>. 107)</p>

<p class="fst">The synchronic, then, is this new usage, is a concept of immense 
dignity: it is nothing less than the theory of Spinozan eternity, the knowledge 
of the exceedingly complex character of <i>La Structure a Dominante.</i> But 
there is still a small place left for the diachronic, which (we remember) was 
swallowed by structure some time ago, but still has an impoverished existence 
within structure&#8217;s stomach. &#8216;Historical time&#8217; is an &#8216;ideological&#8217; concept 
derived by &#8216;empiricism&#8217; from the supposed &#8216;obviousness&#8217; of the &#8216;concrete-real 
historical sequence.&#8217; Under theoretical scrutiny, diachrony reveals itself to be 
&#8216;merely the false name for the <i>process</i>, or for what Marx called the <i>
development of forms&#8217;</i> (<i>R.C.</i> 108) But this &#8216;process&#8217; is no longer the 
whole process of historical eventuation, within which structures and social 
formations arise and are transformed. This &#8216;process&#8217; is now an <i>attribute</i> 
of structure, or, more exactly, it is the history of structure&#8217;s possible 
permutations, combinations, and forms. This concept of historical time</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Can only be based on the complex and differentially 
articulated structure in dominance of the social totality that constitutes the 
social formation arising from a determinate mode of production, it can only be 
assigned a content as a function of the structure of that totality, considered 
either as a whole, or in its different &#8216;levels.&#8217; In particular, it is only 
possible to give a content to the concept of historical time by defining 
historical time as the specific form of existence of the social totality under 
consideration, an existence in which different structural levels of temporarily 
interfere, because of the peculiar relations of correspondence, 
non-correspondence, articulation, dislocation and torsion which obtain, between 
the different &#8216;levels&#8217; of the whole in accordance with its general structure.&quot; (<i>R.C.</i> 
108)</p>

<p class="fst">Thus the eviction of process from history, and its subsequent 
incorporation as a secondary attribute of structure. In all this exposition, I 
have more than allowed to Althusser his &#8216;say&#8217;; and I think that I have even 
improved upon his argument by marking sequential propositions more firmly and by 
compressing some of his repetitious rhetorical invocations. We will now offer 
some observations. And, first, it can be seen that this is very much more than a 
&#8216;flirtation&quot; with the vocabulary of structuralism. This is an inexorable 
structuralism, even though it is, in this or that respect, a different one from 
those derived from Saussure, Levi-Strauss or Lacan. It shares fully in that 
ideological predisposition of that moment (&#8216;conjuncture&#8217;?) of the Cold War 
stasis, which Sartre has identified: a &#8216;dominant tendency&#8217; toward &#8216;the denial of 
history.&#8217; In this moment, structuralism &#8216;gives the people what they needed&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;An eclectic synthesis in which Robbe-Grillet, structuralism, 
linguistics, Lacan, and <i>Tel Quel</i> are systematically utilized to 
demonstrate the impossibility of historical reflection. Behind history, of 
course, it is Marxism which is attacked.&#8221;<a href="#n102" name="fn102" target="_self">[102]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Second, we should note the apparent &#8216;reputability&#8217; of the 
rhetorical acrobatics. If we suppose (as Althusser always does appear to 
suppose) that the only possible alternative to his version of &#8216;Marxism&#8217; is the 
most crude caricature of vulgar &#8216;economism&#8217;, then any aspirant intellectual 
subjected to the cynical scrutiny of &#8216;bourgeois&#8217; scholars will clearly opt for 
Althusser. If we must say <i>either</i> (with Stalin) that &#8216;the base creates the 
superstructure precisely in order that it may serve it&#8217;, <i>or</i> (with 
Althusser) that &#8216;between the different &#8220;levels&#8221; of the whole&#8217; there are 
&#8216;peculiar relations of. correspondence, noncorrespondence, articulation, 
dislocation and torsion&#8217;, then, if we are in a seminar at the Sorbonne, we will 
find the latter vocabulary more reputable. We may also find that the assignment 
of different times and histories to different (&#8216;relatively autonomous&#8217;) &#8216;levels&#8217; 
(political, aesthetic, scientific, philosophic, etc.) affords to us a &#8216;Marxist&#8217; 
legitimation for carrying on with age-old academic procedures of isolation which 
are abjectly disintegrative of the enterprise of historical materialism: the 
understanding of the full historical process. Thus Althusser can only pose as a 
&#8216;flexible&#8217; theorist by suppressing any recognition of the actual practice, 
theory, and findings of historians in the Marxist tradition: and in other 
traditions as well.</p>

<p class="fst">Third, we may note, once again, the characteristically idealist 
mode of discourse. Althusser supposes that we can attain to a theory of 
structure, of history, by re-arranging and elaborating our vocabulary. Now, 
clearly, any statement, however &#8216;abstract&#8217;, however &#8216;empirical&#8217;, is constituted 
of an arrangement of words. And certain crucially-significant conceptual 
discoveries may at first be formulated in a highly abstract manner. One ought to 
welcome the informed scrutiny by philosophers of the lax employment by 
historians of unexamined concepts. But it is difficult to understand how a 
theory of history can be elaborated which does not, at any point, submit itself 
to the historical discipline, to historians&#8217; own discourse of the proof. And 
this, as I have sufficiently argued, involves the (empirical) interrogation of 
evidence, the dialogue of hypothesis and &#8216;fact.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Well, then, it might be argued that Althusser, in his generosity, 
has presented to historians, not one concept, but several volumes of concepts 
and hypotheses, which should now be tested in historical laboratories. But this 
will never be possible, unless in such factories as that of Messrs Hindess and 
Hirst, who have discovered the secret of manufacturing synthetic history and 
synthetic sociology out of conceptual air. For Althusser&#8217;s categories have 
already been de-socialised and de-historicised before we can start. They 
commence their life as <i>categories of stasis</i>: that is, however elaborate 
the orbits in which they rotate, the permutations between orbits and the 
distortions as they are presented to the differential fields of gravity of other 
orbiting categories and the great attractive power of <i>La Dominante -</i> 
however much fussy complexity of motion is simulated by the vocabulary, the 
categories remain distinct, isolated from each other, the same.</p>

<p class="fst">Moreover, we are offered an arbitrary selection of categories - 
as &#8216;economics&#8217;, &#8216;politics&#8217;, &#8216;ideology&#8217; - and neither the principle of selection 
nor the categories themselves are examined. In the crucially-important passages 
which we set out at length above, we hear nothing about the State and almost 
nothing about classes. Other categories are absent throughout: we hear nothing 
about <i>power -</i> perhaps this is &#8216;politics&#8217;, although in &#8216;real history' it 
may often also be &#8216;economics&#8217; or &#8216;law&#8217; or &#8216;religion&#8217;. We hear nothing about <i>
consciousness</i> (whether as <i>mentalite</i> or as culture or <i>habitus</i> 
or as class consciousness) and nothing about values or value-systems (unless in 
their dismissal along with &#8216;moralism&#8217; and &#8216;ideology&#8217;). Thus we are given an 
arbitrary (theoretically unjustified) selection of categories, and these are 
static, unexamined ones, which supposedly maintain their analytic effectivity 
not only through all the development of forms of a given mode of production but 
also in differing modes of production (for feudalism also has &#8216;politics&#8217;, 
&#8216;economics&#8217;, &#8216;religion&#8217;, etc.) But over historical time the real content of 
these categories has changed so profoundly as to impose upon the historian 
extreme care in their employment, just as, over the same period, &#8216;science&#8217; has 
changed from magic to alchemy to science to technology - and sometimes to 
ideology.</p>

<p class="fst">The reason why Althusser is able to employ static categories in 
this way is that they are empty of all social and historical content: all that 
has been tipped away, and his rotating &#8216;instances&#8217; are like so many hollow tin 
cans. If we scarcely hear about the State or about class, we can not expect to 
hear about particular state formations or about <i>which</i> classes or about 
alternative and conflicting beliefs within &#8216;ideology&#8217;. The talismanic concepts 
are &#8216;relative autonomy&#8217; and &#8216;in the last instance determination.&#8217; We were given 
these by Engels, and we learned them in our theoretical cradle. Althusser now 
polishes them, gives them back to us, and supposes that they illuminate the 
whole historical landscape. But <i>determination</i>, which is at the still 
centre of his whole revolving gravitational field, does not merit one sentence 
of theoretical scrutiny.<a href="#n103" name="fn103" target="_self">[103]</a> 
&#8216;In the last instance&#8217; is not examined: it is merely perpetually postponed. 
&#8216;Relative autonomy&#8217;, on the contrary, has been lovingly elaborated, over many 
pages, and reappears as &#8216;instances&#8217;, &#8216;levels&#8217;, differential temporalities, 
dislocations and torsions. Yes, yes, and perhaps all this is so. But how might 
we put such a concept to work? Is law, for example, relatively autonomous, and, 
if so, autonomous of what, and how relatively?</p>

<p class="fst">I have, as it happens, been interested in this myself, in my 
historical practice: not, of course, in any grand way - for the whole of 
history, nor for the capitalist mode of production everywhere, but in a very 
petty conjuncture: in an island on the edge of the Atlantic, very well supplied 
with lawyers, at a moment in the eighteenth century. So my evidence is highly 
marginal, as well as being seriously contaminated by empirical content. But what 
I discovered there would make <i>La Structure a Dominante</i> boggle. For I 
found that law did not keep politely to a &#8216;level&#8217; but was at <i>every</i> bloody 
level; it was imbricated within the mode of production and productive relations 
themselves (as property-rights, definitions of agrarian practice) and it was 
simultaneously present in the philosophy of Locke; it intruded brusquely within 
alien categories, reappearing bewigged and gowned in the guise of ideology; it 
danced a cotillon with religion, moralising over the theatre of Tyburn; it was 
an arm of politics and politics was one of its arms; it was an academic 
discipline, subjected to the rigour of its own autonomous logic; it contributed 
to the definition of the self-identity both of rulers and of ruled; above all, 
it afforded an arena for class struggle, within which alternative notions of law 
were fought out.</p>

<p class="fst">But how about &#8216;in the last instance determination&#8217;? Did I observe 
that? Well, for most of the time when I was watching, law was running quite free 
of economy, doing its errands, defending its property, preparing the way for it, 
and so on . . . But... I hesitate to whisper the heresy ... on several 
occasions, while I was actually watching, the lonely hour of the last instance <i>
actually came.</i> The last instance like an unholy ghost, actually, grabbed 
hold of law, throttled it, and forced it to change its language and to will into 
existence forms appropriate to the mode of production, such as enclosure acts 
and new case-law excluding customary common rights. But was law &#8216;relatively 
autonomous&#8217;? Oh, <i>yes.</i> Sometimes. Relatively. <i>Of course.</i>'<a href="#n104" name="fn104" target="_self">[104]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Please do not misunderstand me. I am not only arguing that 
Althusser has taken his categories unexamined from his own academic 
surroundings: the departments of politics., law, economics, etc. - academic 
isolates which any historian in his apprenticeship learns to disregard. Nor am I 
only arguing that Althusser&#8217;s elaborate constructions advance enquiry not one 
jot: that we commence with &#8216;relative autonomy&#8217; and, after tedious exercises in 
sophistication (but without putting the concept to any real work or feeding it 
with any content), we come out at the end with, exactly, &#8216;relative autonomy&#8217; - a 
kind of oratorical sauce with which to season our researches, but for which 
(since my palate has always approved it) we have to thank not Althusser but 
Engels. Nor am I only arguing that Althusser&#8217;s concepts and constructions are 
futile because they are merely arrangements of words, so lacking in substantive 
content that they afford no purchase to a historian as analytic tools. All these 
things are true. But I am also arguing that Althusser&#8217;s constructions are 
actively <i>wrong</i> and thoroughly misleading. His notion of &#8216;levels&#8217; motoring 
around in history at different speeds and on different schedules is an academic 
fiction. For all these &#8216;instances&#8217; and &#8216;levels&#8217; are in fact human activities, 
institutions, and ideas. We are talking about men and women, in their material 
life, in their determinate relationships, in their experience of these, and in 
their self-consciousness of this experience. By &#8216;determinate relationships&#8217; we 
indicate relationships structured within particular social formations in class 
ways - a very different set of &#8216;levels&#8217;, and one generally overlooked by 
Althusser - and that the class experience will find simultaneous expression in 
all these &#8216;instances&#8217;, &#8216;levels&#8217;, institutions and activities.</p>

<p class="fst">It is true that the effectivity of class experience and conflict 
will be differently expressed in different activities and institutions, and that 
we may, by an act of analytic isolation, write distinct &#8216;histories&#8217; of these. 
But at least some part of what is expressed - as, fear of the crowd in 
&#8216;politics&#8217; reappearing as contempt for manual labour among the genteel 
reappearing as contempt for <i>praxis</i> in the academy reappearing as Black 
Acts in the &#8216;law&#8217; reappearing as doctrines of subordination in &#8216;religion&#8217; - will 
be <i>the same unitary experience</i> or determining pressure, eventuating in 
the <i>same</i> historical time, and moving to the <i>same</i> rhythm: a peasant 
revolt or the Gordon Riots may accentuate the pressure, a <i>longue duree</i> of 
good harvests and demographic equilibrium may allow it to relax. So that all 
these distinct &#8216;histories&#8217; must be convened within the same real historical 
time, the time within which process eventuates. This integral process is the 
ultimate object of historical knowledge, and it is this which Althusser offers 
to disintegrate.</p>

<p class="fst">Certainly, &#8216;relative autonomy&#8217; is a helpful talisman against 
reductionism - against collapsing art or law or religion abjectly back into 
class or &#8216;economics&#8217;; but, without substantial addition, and substantive 
analysis, it remains as nothing more than a warning-notice. Certainly, the hour 
of the last instance never comes, if, by that hour, one supposes the total 
collapse of all human activities back into the elementary terms of a mode of 
production. Such collapses may be detonated on paper (they often are) but they 
cannot be observed in history. But, in another sense, the &#8216;last instance&#8217; has <i>
always arrived</i>, and is everpresent as a pressure within all of Althusser&#8217;s 
&#8216;instances&#8217;; nor is the last instance ever lonely, for it is attended by all the 
retinue of class.</p>

<p class="fst">That was a long observation. Althusser&#8217;s mode of discourse is 
idealist: he employs static categories derived from the disciplines of the 
academy: <i>La Structure a Dominante</i> is too well-bred to acknowledge class 
in her character: and his constructions are disintegrative of process. The 
fourth observation may be brief. Althusser&#8217;s constructions of the &#8216;theory of 
history&#8217; afford no terms for <i>experience</i>, nor for process when it is 
considered as human <i>practice.</i> We have already discussed, long ago, 
Althusser&#8217;s epistemological refusals of experience (&#8216;empiricism&#8217;). That was odd, 
but a pardonable oddity in a philosopher, who can cite formidable precedents. 
But it is not pardonable in anyone who offers to think about history, since 
experience and practice are manifest; nor is it pardonable in a &#8216;Marxist&#8217;, since 
experience is a necessary middle term between social being and social 
consciousness: it is experience (often class experience) which gives a 
coloration to culture, to values, and to thought: it is by means of experience 
that the mode of production exerts a determining pressure upon other activities: 
and it is by practice that production is sustained. The reason for these 
omissions will become clear when we consider the other eviction, the eviction of 
human agency.</p>

<p class="fst">My fifth observation has been argued sufficiently in passing. 
Althusser&#8217;s structuralism is, like all structuralisms, a system of <i>closure</i> 
(see p. 113). It fails to effect the distinction between structured process, 
which, while subject to determinate pressures, remains open-ended and only 
partially-determined, and a structured whole, within which process is 
encapsulated. It opts for the latter, and goes on to construct something much 
more splendid than a clock. We may call it Althusser&#8217;s orrery, a complex 
mechanism in which all the bodies in the solar system revolve around the 
dominant sun. But it remains a mechanism, in which, as in all such 
structuralisms, human practice is reified, and &#8216;man is in some way developed by 
the development of structure.'<a href="#n105" name="fn105" target="_self">[105]</a> 
So inexorable is this mechanism, in the relation of parts to the whole within 
any mode of production, that it is only by means of the most acrobatic 
formulations that we can envisage the possibility of transition from one mode of 
production to another.&#8217;<a href="#n106" name="fn106" target="_self">[106]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In all the passages of argument cited above, there is only one 
argument which I find to be good. This is in Althusser&#8217;s critique of the 
synchronic methods of other structuralisms (or sociological theories), which by 
arresting process and taking a &#8216;section' suppose that the articulation of a 
totality will be revealed (p. 124). But the critique is inadequate, and for good 
reasons, for an adequate critique would have exploded in Althusser&#8217;s own face. 
It is not only that the structuration of process, (or, as I would prefer, the 
congruent logics of process) can only be revealed in the observation of process 
over time. It is also that each moment, each &#8216;now&#8217; (&#8216;conjuncture&#8217;), should not 
be seen as a frozen moment of the intersection of multiple subordinate and 
dominant determinations (&#8216;overdetermination&#8217;) but as a moment of <i>becomings</i> 
of alternative possibilities, of ascendant and descendant forces, of opposing 
(class) definitions and exertions, of &#8216;double-tongued&#8217; signs. Between these two 
notions of the &#8216;now&#8217; there lies an unbridgeable gulf, which falls between 
Necessity (or Vico&#8217;s divine will) and Morris&#8217;s everbaffled but ever-resurgent 
human agents. On the one hand, history as a process without a subject: on the 
other, history as unmastered human practice. We know which side Althusser is on: 
process programmed within a structure, an orrery turned by a hidden hand.</p>

<h3><a name="h12">xii</a></h3>

<p class="fst">And yet - we had almost forgotten - a motive-power is provided. 
For - &#8216;class struggle is the motor of history.&#8217; We first meet with this &#8216;basic 
Marxist proposition&#8217; in <i>For Marx</i> (p. 215). We have found the hidden hand. 
We hear about this less in <i>Reading Capital,</i> the class struggle scarcely 
appears in any of its critical formulations on history, and this may account for 
my forgetfulness. But it reappears, and with the sternest political 
countenance,, in the wigging which Althusser gave to the good Dr. Lewis. It is 
now a thesis of Marxism-Leninism: &#8220;The class struggle is the motor of history&#8221; 
(Thesis of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>, 1847).&#8217; (<i>Essays,</i> 47).</p>

<p class="fst">Now there are certain points to make about this &#8216;basic Marxist 
proposition&#8217;, unexceptionable as it may be. First (and a trivial point) I can 
find the proposition nowhere in Marx, nor can my more learned friends. It is 
certainly not to be found in the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>, although the reader 
might suppose - I did suppose - that we were being offered a direct quotation. 
What the <i>Manifesto</i> does say, in its opening line, as should be too 
well-known to repeat, is: &#8216;The history of all hitherto existing society is the 
history of class struggles,&#8217; to which Engels subse-</p>

<p class="fst">quently added a footnote excusing from the formulation primitive 
societies (which, we must presume, had no &#8216;motor&#8217;). The two statements, in any 
case, are not the same. But I do find, on occasion, in Marx and Engels analogies 
which bring us very close to &#8216;motor.&#8217; For example, in a letter of 1879 to the 
German Party leaders (Bebel, etc.) over the signatures of both, they write:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;For almost forty years we have stressed the class-struggle as 
the immediate driving power of history 5 and in particular the class-struggle 
between bourgeoisie and proletariat as the great lever of the modern social 
revolution . . .&#8221;<a href="#n107" name="fn107" target="_self">[107]</a></p>

<p class="fst">So: the point turns out to be a quibble: Althusser may keep his 
&#8216;motor&#8217;, and we may offer him a lever&#8217; as well.</p>

<p class="fst">There was another point, which I cannot now remember . . . Oh, 
yes, &#8216;motor&#8217; is not a &#8216;basic proposition&#8217; or a concept or a 'thesis&#8217; at all: it 
is an <i>analogy.</i> This point is a little more difficult. If Marx <i>had</i> 
said (and I think he did not) that &#8216;the class struggle is the motor of history&#8217; 
he would not have meant that the class struggle had somehow transmogrified 
itself into a Boulton &amp; Watt steam-engine driving history&#8217;s moving-parts. The 
statement is of the order of &#8216;as if&#8217;: we may envisage the history of society <i>
as if</i> it were driven forward by the power (engine, motor) of the class 
struggle. Analogies may be good or bad, but my present point is that they serve 
the purpose of explication or illustration - they are a condiment to argument 
often used only once or twice in passing, but they are not the argument itself. 
They may sometimes be greatly illuminating, and in ways unintended by the 
author; they merit a &#8216;symptomatic&#8217; reading; in certain authors (for example, 
Burke) they may be more illuminating than the argument itself; they are often 
the sign of thought&#8217;s vitality. But, and still, analogies, metaphors, images are 
not the same thing as concepts. They cannot be transfixed with the arrow of 
theory, plucked from the side of the text which they explicate, and mounted as 
concepts, on a plinth inscribed &#8216;Basic Proposition.&#8217; It may not matter much in 
this case. But it.</p>

<p class="fst">does matter, very much, in the case of another analogy, which has 
more generally been petrified into a concept: that of basis and superstructure. 
The graveyard of philosophy is cluttered with grand systems which mistook 
analogies for concepts. A headstone is already being prepared for Marxist 
structuralism.</p>

<p class="fst">Point three: is it a good analogy? Not particularly. The reader 
who has bothered to accompany me this far can certainly think this out for 
himself.</p>

<p class="fst">I have argued before (p. 114) that there are definite reasons why 
analogies derived from mechanism or from natural process can <i>never</i> be 
adequate to human process, which includes properties not to be found in either. 
Given that the attempt must sometimes be made, for purposes of explication, the 
analogy of&#8216;driving-power&#8217; is inoffensive. &#8216;Driving-power&#8217; is not, of course, the 
same thing as the engine or &#8216;motor&#8217; itself, which initiates the drive. Marx and 
Engels, who lived in the pre-history of the internal combustion engine, were 
perhaps thinking of a Lancashire cotton mill, and not of the engine and its 
furnace, but of the shafts and transmission belts which directed the same <i>
drive</i> to different machines and moving parts: this drive, transmitted 
equally to law and politics and ideology, becomes, by analogy, the class 
struggle, and all the parts in motion together (the factory) become &#8216;history.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">The analogy may be helpful in some ways,'<a href="#n108" name="fn108" target="_self">[108]</a> 
and unhelpful in others. But what concerns us is the use to which it is put by 
Althusser. For we remember that for Althusser &#8216;history', in its common usage as 
eventuating human process, is an &#8216;ideological&#8217; concept, to be rejected along 
with &#8216;historical time.' But Althusser also must recognise that Marx himself was 
not innocent of this &#8216;ideological&#8217; error. (Indeed, how could he not recognise 
this, when Marx and Engels&#8217;s works are full of allusions and invocations to 
history as process?). Marx offers us a structuralism (a premonition of 
Althusserianism) but he was insufficiently aware (theoretically) of what he was 
offering, and of the difference between this and a &#8216;historicism.&#8217; He &#8216;did not 
think the <i>concept</i> of this distinction with all the sharpness that could 
be desired; he did not think theoretically . . . either the concept or the 
theoretical implications of the theoretically revolutionary step he had taken.&#8217; 
(<i>R.C.</i> 120-1) Following Vico, Marx blundered into &#8216;a remarkable 
presupposition: that the actors of history are the authors of its text, the 
subjects of its production.&#8217; (<i>R.C.</i> 139) (One might note, in passing, that 
this is not one presupposition but two different analogies: actors certainly are 
not usually authors of their text, but they are subjects of a theatrical 
production, although in ways partially determined by the producer.) In Marx&#8217;s 
discourse there are &#8216;lacunae, blanks and failures of rigour&#8217;, and these occur 
when we encounter the word 'history&#8217; - an &#8216;apparently full word&#8217; but &#8216;in fact 
theoretically an empty word&#8217;, replete with ideology. However, in Althusser&#8217;s 
&#8216;epistemological and critical reading . . . we cannot but hear behind the 
profferred word the silence it conceals, see the blank of suspended rigour, 
scarcely the time of a lightning-flash in the darkness of the text.&#8217; It is the 
business of theoretical practice, like a skilled restorer of old manuscripts, to 
mend these tears, repair these blanks and silences, and restore the text. (R.C. 
143)</p>

<p class="fst">It must follow that if both Marx and Althusser say that class 
struggle is the &#8216;motor&#8217; of history (which Marx does not) they are saying 
different things: for Marx is thinking absent-mindedly of an (ideological?) 
process of struggle and eventuation, and Althusser has rigorously thought a 
structural orrery:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;History is an immense <i>natural-human</i> system in 
movement, and the motor of history is class struggle. History is a process, and 
a <i>process without a subject.</i>&quot; (<i>Essays,</i> 51)</p>

<p class="fst">For Marx the historical process eventuates <i>as if</i> it was 
impelled forward by this generalised drive (of conflicting actors); for 
Althusser the orrery of system <i>literally is motored</i> through all its 
evolutions and permutations by class struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">We are not for a moment allowed to suppose that classes are the <i>
subjects</i> of history, which might then be seen as the outcome of refracted 
human agency. Althusser does, in a concession to a supposedly simple-minded 
English public, once offer the &#8216;thesis&#8217;: &#8216;It is the <i>masses</i> which make 
history.&#8217; (<i>Essays</i>,. 46) (No-one, it seems, had warned him, in this 
empirical island, the category of &#8216;masses&#8217; had long been scrutinised, and found 
to be a disreputable - indeed, a &#8216;bourgeois&#8217; concept.)<a href="#n109" name="fn109" target="_self">[109]</a> 
But the concession is no sooner made than it is withdrawn: for the masses are <i>
made</i> to make history, they are motored by the class struggle, and the 
classes also (it turns out) are motored. Class is a category which, in 
Althusser&#8217;s major work, goes unexamined. And the classes which do make an 
entrance from time to time, and march up and down the pages - the bourgeoisie, 
the proletariat - are exceedingly crude projections of Theory, like primeval 
urges with iron heads, since &#8216;politics&#8217;, &#8216;law&#8217;, etc., etc., have been taken out 
of their heads and put at different &#8216;levels&#8217;, and since consciousness, values, 
and culture have been excluded from the vocabulary. So that, while we are told 
that class struggle is the &#8216;motor&#8217; of history, there is a theoretical cut-off 
beyond which we may not go: we are not informed as to the nature of classes, nor 
how struggle eventuates, nor how this &#8216;motor&#8217; works. Althusser&#8217;s contribution to <i>
Reading Capital</i> concludes: &#8216;The reader will know how Volume Three ends. A 
title: <i>Classes.</i> Forty lines, then silence.&#8217; (.<i>R.C</i>. 193) Then 
silence.</p>

<p class="fst">After Althusser, his epigones: Balibar, Hindess and Hirst, 
Poulantzas, and a hundred others have been happily filling in that silence, 
taking advantage of the blank pages in Marx&#8217;s unfinished notebook. I do not like 
what they write. For historical materialism has also made, over many decades, 
its own very substantial investigations into class struggle, and has developed 
its findings in theoretical ways. There are disagreements among practitioners, 
of course; but in this area, and within the British tradition of Marxist 
historiography, there is very substantial agreement. And our findings can not, 
with any exercise of verbal agility, be compressed into the forms of Althusser&#8217;s 
orrery.</p>

<p class="fst">I have written about this so often that I bore, not only my 
audience, but myself. I will not go over it all again. Class formations (I have 
argued) arise at the intersection of determination and self-activity: the 
working class &#8216;made itself as much as it was made.&#8217; We cannot put &#8216;class&#8217; here 
and &#8216;class consciousness&#8217; there, as two separate entities, the one sequential 
upon the other, since both must be taken together &#8212; the experience of 
determination, and the &#8216;handling&#8217; of this in conscious ways. Nor can we deduce 
class from a static &#8216;section' (since it is a <i>becoming</i> over time), nor as 
a function of a mode of production, since class formations and class 
consciousness (while subject to determinate pressures) eventuate in an 
open-ended process of <i>relationship -</i> of struggle with other classes - 
over time.</p>

<p class="fst">As it happens, Althusser and I appear to share one common 
proposition: class struggle is the prior concept to class, class does not 
precede but arises out of struggle.<a href="#n110" name="fn110" target="_self">[110]</a> 
But the coincidence is only an apparition. For in one view (a view shared by 
most Marxist historians) classes arise because men and women, in determinate 
productive relations, identify their antagonistic interests, and come to 
struggle, to think, and to value in class ways: thus the process of class 
formation is a process of selfmaking, although under conditions which are 
&#8216;given.&#8217; But this view is intolerable to Althusser, since it would give back to 
process a subject, for the process would then be seen to be one in which men and 
women (however baffled, and however limited their space for agency) remain 
agents. Althusser however, while silent on class, has never taken one step along 
this dangerous &#8216;humanist&#8217; road. For, prior to the concept of the class struggle 
is the concept of &#8216;contradiction&#8217;, and the second concept is a function of the 
first:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The specific difference of Marxist contradiction is its 
&#8216;unevenness&#8217;, or &#8216;over-determination&#8217; which reflects in it its condition of 
existence, that is, the specific structure of unevenness (in dominance) of the 
ever-pregiven complex whole which is its existence. Thus understood, 
contradiction is the motor of all development.&quot; (<i>P.M.</i> 217)</p>

<p class="fst">The whole of this monstrous &#8216;theoretical expression&#8217; (and several 
lines more) are italicised to emphasise their centrality and their rigour, but I 
have spared the reader&#8217;s eyes. I cannot so easily spare his thoughts. For we now 
find that contradiction is the motor which motors the motor of class struggle. 
Tracing these motors back in series, Balibar concludes, with estimable logic:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Classes art functions of the process of production as a 
whole. They are not <i>its subjects, on the contrary, they are determined by its 
form.</i>&quot; (R.C. 267)</p>

<p class="fst">The subject (or agent) of history disappears once again. Process, 
for the rath time, is re-ified. And since classes are &#8216;functions of the process 
of production&#8217; (a process into which, it seems, no human agency could possibly 
enter), the way is thrown open once again to all the rubbish of deducing 
classes, class fractions, class ideologies (&#8216;true' and &#8216;false&#8217;) from their 
imaginary positioning - above, below, interpellatory, vestigial, slant-wise - 
within a mode of production (or within its multiple contradictions, torsions, 
dislocations, etc. etc.), and this mode of production is conceived of as <i>
something other than</i> its eventuation in historical process, and within &#8216;the 
ensemble of social relations', although in fact it exists only as a construction 
within a metaphysical oration.</p>

<p class="fst">We might define the present situation more precisely if we 
employed a category found frequently in Marx&#8217;s correspondence with Engels, but a 
category which evaded Althusser&#8217;s vigilant symptomatic scrutiny. All this &#8216;shit&#8217; 
(<i>Geschichten-scheissenschlopff</i>), in which both bourgeois sociology and 
Marxist structuralism stand up to their chins (Dahrendorf beside Poulantzas, 
modernization theory beside theoretical practice) has been shat upon as by 
conceptual paralysis, by the de-historicising of process, and by reducing class, 
ideology, social formations, and almost everything else, to categorical stasis. 
The sociological section: the elaborate differential rotations within the 
closure of the orrery; the self-extrapolating programmed developmental series; 
the mildly disequilibrated equilibrium models, in which dissensus strays 
unhappily down strange corridors, searching for a reconciliation with consensus; 
the systems-analyses and structuralisms, with their torques and their 
combinatories; the counter-factual fictions; the econometric and cleometric 
groovers - all of these theories hobble along programmed routes from one static 
category to the next. And all of them are <i>Geschichtenscheissenschlopff,</i> 
unhistorical shit.</p>

<p class="fst">And yet, in these days, we are offered little else. They torture 
us on the rack of their interminable formulations until we are brought to the 
limits of endurance. We may not answer in any other language; only this one is 
rigorous and reputable. Above our heads, in the high academies, the inquisitors 
dispute; they fiercely disagree, but they recognise each other&#8217;s complexity and 
repute. At last they extract from us a denial: a denial of human agency, 
creativity, a denial even of self. But, as we rise from their theoretical racks, 
we see, through the window, the process of history going on. <i>&#8216;E per&#8221; si 
muove!</i>&#8217; - and yet, <i>it does move!</i> We know - for in some remote part of 
our personality we remain determined by reason - that we must, somehow, find the 
courage to repudiate our own denial.</p>

<p class="fst">As our senses return, we remember why we never did much like the 
analogy of class struggle as the motor of history. For it supposes two distinct 
entities: &#8216;history&#8217;, which is inert, an intricate composite of parts; and a 
&#8216;motor&#8217; (class struggle) which is brought <i>to</i> it, and which drives these 
parts, or sets them in motion. Medieval scholastics would have used a different 
analogy: class struggle would have been the vital breath or soul that animated 
history&#8217;s inert body. But class struggle <i>is</i> the process (or some part of 
it) and struggling classes <i>are</i> the body (or some part of it). Seen from 
this aspect, history is its own motor.</p>

<p class="fst">This leads us to a general reflection upon the language of 
structuralism. Once again, we can observe the pressure of social being upon 
social consciousness, not only within &#8216;bourgeois&#8217; ideology but within Marxist 
thought as well I have sketched already the political and sociological context: 
the glaciation of all social process induced by the Cold War. But there have 
been other, intersecting, reasons. European thinkers, in the nineteenth century, 
were disposed to grasp at analogies from natural process (often progress), not 
only for manifest political and sociological reasons, but because this language 
seemed to be given by the technology and the natural sciences of their time. 
Today&#8217;s theorists are very differently situated. In the first place, they are 
segregated more than ever before from practice; they work within institutions, 
which are complexly-structured, according to &#8216;schedules&#8217; and programmes; less of 
their information arises from observation (unless in forays &#8216;into the fields&#8217;) 
and more arrives before them as Althusser&#8217;s G II or G III; their knowledge of 
the world is composed, increasingly, within their heads or their theories by 
non-observational means. They are surrounded on every side by &#8216;structures.&#8217; Even 
their universities (and especially the new ones) are not architectural 
utterances but structures, with a subterranean basis, visited only by 
proletarian porters and boiler-men, with economics and the social sciences on 
the first two floors, and philosophy and literature, which can only be reached 
by elevator, at much higher levels. Meanwhile technology (or what they know of 
technology by report) is no longer a matter of driving-shafts and belts and 
extending railway communications, but a matter of circuits, intricate gearing, 
automated programmes; the natural sciences report on complex molecular 
structures and the torque of DNA; institutions are subjected to 
systems-analysis; and within all this there arrives, with inevitable 
punctuality, cybernetics and the computer, which sieves, sorts, and organises 
impartially all languages - of technology, natural science, sociology, 
economics, history - on one condition only: that the categories which it ingests 
shall be unambiguous and constant in conformity with the constancy of its own 
complex binary programme.<a href="#n111" name="fn111" target="_self">[111]</a></p>

<p class="fst">I do not set all this down in order to reject it in a fit of 
romantic temper. This is where we live now; and this gives us some of our 
experience. But this experience must inevitably press into our vocabulary, and, 
in particular, into the vocabulary of analogy. And sometimes we must plainly 
resist this pressure, when we have reason to suspect that its &#8216;common sense&#8217; 
disguises ideology. Just as Marx had to repudiate the &#8216;shit&#8217; of Political 
Economy&#8217;s Malthusian and market analogies, so we must repudiate inappropriate 
analogies of levels, circuits, and complex closures. Nor can we allow the 
computer to dictate that our categories stand still for its convenience. The 
organic analogies of the nineteenth century, derived from the observation of 
plants, of stock, of growth, were sometimes improperly applied to human 
occasions, but they were, at least, analogies derived not from structure but 
from process. But as the observational field of today&#8217;s theorists becomes more 
specialised and more segregated from practice, where are they to turn for 
comparable analogies, for a vocabulary of interaction and eventuation? We might 
start, I suggest, by observing ourselves.</p>

<p class="fst">I have hurled sufficient invective at the head of categorical 
stasis. And what is the alternative? An intuitive, empirical refusal of theory? 
A historical relativism which demands fresh categories for every context? We may 
be helped at this point by Sartre, whose thought I cannot (as a good Englishman) 
always follow in its subtlety - nor always assent to - but whose understanding 
of history, and whose relationship to political reality, is altogether superior, 
at every point, to that of Althusser.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Althusser, like Foucault, sticks to the analysis of 
structure. From the epistemological point of view, that amounts to returning to 
siding with the <i>concept</i> against the <i>notion.</i> The concept is 
atemporal. One can study how concepts are engendered one after the other within 
determined categories. But neither time itself nor, consequently, history, can 
be made the object of a concept. There is a contradiction in terms. When you 
introduce temporality, you come to see that within a temporal development the 
concept modifies itself. <i>Notion,</i> on the contrary, can be defined as the 
synthetic effort to produce an idea which develops itself by contradiction and 
its successive overcoming, and therefore is homogenous to the development of 
things.&#8221;<a href="#n112" name="fn112" target="_self">[112]</a></p>

<p class="fst">I am not sure that I accept this notion. But Sartre&#8217;s argument 
conforms closely to my own earlier argument as to the approximate and 
provisional nature of historical concepts, as to their &#8216;elasticity&#8217; and 
generality (&#8216;classes&#8217;, &#8216;class struggle&#8217;), as to their character as expectations 
rather than as rules. (See p. 62) It conforms also to vigilant rejection of the 
closed and static concept or analogy in favour of the open and the shaping, 
formative one: as, by replacing law of motion&#8217; by logic of process&#8217;, and by 
understanding determinism, not as pre-determined programming or the implantation 
of necessity, but in its senses as the &#8216;setting of limits&#8217; and the 'exerting of 
pressures.&#8217;<a href="#n113" name="fn113" target="_self">[113]</a> It means 
retaining the notion of structure, but as structural actuation (limits and 
pressures) within a social formation which remains protean in its forms. It 
means the refusal of that trick of thought, discussed by Raymond Williams in 
considering &#8216;basis&#8217; and &#8216;superstructure&#8217;, by which the &#8216;metaphorical terms for a 
relationship&#8217; are extended &#8216;into abstract categories or concrete areas&#8217;, until 
these analytic categories</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;As so often in idealist thought, have, almost unnoticed, 
become substantive descriptions, which then take habitual priority over the 
whole social process to which, as analytic categories, they are attempting to 
speak.&#8221;<a href="#n114" name="fn114" target="_self">[114]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It means that even when we decide, for legitimate reasons, to 
isolate certain activities for distinct analysis - as we may do with modes of 
production or economic process - we do not allow ourselves to be deluded by our 
own procedures into supposing these systems to be distinct. It means that in 
such procedures we employ especial care whenever we come to those 
&#8216;junction-terms&#8217;, which lie at the point of junction between analytic 
disciplines (as, &#8216;need&#8217; in economics which may be seen as a &#8216;norm&#8217; in 
anthropology) or between structure and process (as, &#8216;class&#8217; and &#8216;mode of 
production&#8217;, which lie forever on those borders).</p>

<p class="fst">This is not all. We need, also, more historical <i>thought</i>; a 
greater theoretical self-consciousness as to our own concepts and procedures; 
and more effort, by historians, to communicate their findings to others in 
theoretically-cogent forms. (In all the chatter of &#8216;theoretical practice&#8217; about 
modes of production, precapitalist formations, ideology, the labour process, 
class, the State, ISAs and RSAs, FMPs and CMPs, historians who have made these 
problems the object of sustained investigation have, in general, been ignored, 
and they have returned the compliment with a disdainful silence.) Communication 
will flow in both directions of course. But what we do <i>not</i> need is &#8216;a 
theory of history&#8217;, in Althusser&#8217;s sense. For this theory will be nothing but a 
thin enigma unless it is fattened on the content of substantive historical 
analysis. If we want to know <i>how</i> &#8216;autonomous&#8217;, and &#8216;relative&#8217; to <i>what</i>, 
we may think the problem but then we must <i>find out</i>, and think again about 
our findings. We must put theory to work, and we may do this either by 
interrogating evidence (research) or by interrogating historiography and other 
theories (critique); and both these methods were the ones most commonly employed 
by Marx. Theoretical practice, which rejects the first procedure (&#8216;empiricism&#8217;), 
and which reduces the second procedure to caricature by measuring all other 
positions against its own pre-given orthodoxy, is evidence of nothing but the 
self-esteem of its authors. For the project of Grand Theory - to find a total 
systematised conceptualisation of all history and human occasions - is the 
original heresy of metaphysics against knowledge.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not only that this is like trying to catch running water in 
a sieve. It is not only that we can never reproduce with finality within the 
forms of thought:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;. . . history, that never sleeps or dies,<br>
And, held one moment, burns the hand.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">It is not only that the attempt to do so, in a &#8216;science&#8217; devoid 
of substance, ends up very much like Engels&#8217;s characterisation of the Hegelian 
inheritance: &#8216;a compilation of words and turns of speech which had no other 
purpose than to be at hand at the right time where thought and positive 
knowledge were lacking.&#8217;<a href="#n115" name="fn115" target="_self">[115]</a> 
All this is not all. The project itself is misbegotten; it is <i>an exercise of 
closure</i>, and it stems from a kind of intellectual agoraphobia, an anxiety 
before the uncertain and the unknown, a yearning for security within the cabin 
of the Absolute. As such, it reproduces old theological modes of thought, and 
its constructions are always elaborated from ideological materials.</p>

<p class="fst">More than this, such total systems have, very generally, been at 
enmity with reason and censorious of freedom. They seek, not only to dominate 
all theory - or to expel all other theories as heresies - but also to reproduce 
themselves within social reality. Since theory is a closure, history must be 
brought to conform. They seek to lasso process in their categories, bring it 
down, break its will, and subject it to their command. Within the <i>last 
instance</i> we find the anagram of Stalin.</p>

<p class="fst">Nor is this all. There is also the matter of dialectics. Many 
critics have noted that Althusser has extruded, along with Hegel, dialectics. 
This should be apparent without further demonstration. I do not mean his 
extrusion of this or that &#8216;law&#8217; of dialectics, as in his commendation of Stalin 
for his prescience in challenging the credentials of &#8216;the negation of the 
negation.&#8217; The ontological status of any such &#8216;laws&#8217; is questionable. I mean 
that even in the moment that Althusser acclaims <i>La Dialectique</i>, and 
boasts possessively as to his intimacy with her, he strikes her into a 
statuesque pose; and in that pose we recognise, once again, our old friend, <i>
La Structure a Dominante</i>. She is modeling a new gown, which superbly 
expresses her inner contradictory nature:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;This reflection of the conditions of existence of the 
contradiction within itself, this reflection of the structure articulated in 
dominance that constitutes the unity of the complex whole within each 
contradiction, this is the most profound characteristic of the Marxist 
dialectic.&quot; (F.M. 205-6; and above p. 112)</p>

<p class="fst">This gown is a reflection of contradiction, and the creation is 
presented to us by its designer under the name, 'over-determination&#8217;. The gown 
is fitted perfectly to the model&#8217;s form; but it is so tight that <i>she cannot 
move.</i> In all of Althusser&#8217;s texts, dialectics, conceived as the logic of the 
logic of process, never appears.</p>

<p class="fst">My readers will eagerly anticipate that a hundred page 
disquisition on dialectics will now ensue. I am sorry to disappoint them. It is 
beyond my competence. I wish only to make a few observations, situating myself 
on the <i>outside</i> of an argument into whose complexities I would be 
foolhardy to enter. First, I am of the opinion that the understanding of 
dialectics can only be advanced if an absolute embargo is placed upon the 
mention of Hegel&#8217;s name. This will appear to be absurd and whimsical. But I mean 
to argue it through. Manifestly, Engels and Marx &#8216;owed&#8217; their dialectics to 
Hegel, often returned to Hegel, and often acknowledged their debt. All this has 
been examined by others, and with much ability, and I do not dispute the value 
of the examination. One day it should be resumed. But at this point the 
discussion is not only exhausted, it has become counterproductive. For its 
tendency has been to align its protagonists into &#8216;Hegelian&#8217; Marxists, who, with 
whatever efforts at inversion, tend to see dialectics as a Hegelian suffusion <i>
within</i> process; and anti-Hegelians (whether empirical &#8216;historicists&#8217; or 
Althusserians) who tend, in effect, to discard dialectics along with Hegel.</p>

<p class="fst">But, second, the account which theorists offer of their 
procedures need not be the same thing as those procedures themselves. We may 
agree to reject the account which Engels offered in <i>The Dialectics of Nature,</i> 
but the matter cannot be ended there.<a href="#n116" name="fn116" target="_self">[116]</a> 
There still remain the very motions of thought implicit in many passages of Marx 
and Engels&#8221; analysis, their procedures, and their self-consciousness of these 
procedures. When old Engels thundered out to Schmidt, &#8216;What these gentlemen all 
lack is dialectic&#8217;, he went on to adduce, not dialectical &#8216;laws&#8217;, but the mode 
of apprehension of a fluent and contradictory eventuation:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;They never see anything but here cause and there effect. That 
this is a hollow abstraction, that such metaphysical polar opposites only exist 
in the real world during crises, while the whole vast process proceeds in the 
form of interaction (though of very unequal forces, the economic movement being 
by far the strongest, most elemental and most decisive) and that here everything 
is relative and nothing is absolute - this they never begin to see.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">It is true that the letter ends: &#8216;Hegel never existed for them.&#8217; 
Hegel (inverted) &#8216;taught&#8217; them to see in this way. But let us think more about 
the seeing and less about the teacher. The great-great-grandchildren of &#8216;these 
gentlemen&#8217; have read their <i>Logic</i> upside-down and backwards, but they have 
been taught nothing. &#8216;Contradiction&#8217; is an antagonism, a &#8216;motor&#8217; of struggle: it 
is not a moment of co-existent opposed possibilities. &#8216;Reformism&#8217; must be 
incorporation within capitalist structures: it cannot <i>also</i> be reforms and 
the modification of those structures to allow a space for incorporation. And so 
on: and on and on. &#8216;They never see anything but here cause and there effect.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Thus it is always possible that (as Marx remarked of Spinoza) 
&#8216;the real inner structure of his system is, after all, wholly different from the 
form in which he consciously presented it.<a href="#n117" name="fn117" target="_self">[117]</a> 
And, third, even if we set aside Hegel, we will still have to deal with William 
Blake. I offer Blake, not as a hitherto-unrecognised tutor of Marx, but in order 
to emphasise that the dialectic was not Hegel&#8217;s private property. Blake reminds 
us of a very old, sometimes reputable, sometimes arcane hermetic tradition - 
often a tradition of poets - which sought to articulate modes of apprehension 
appropriate to a reality which was always in flux, in conflict, in decay and in 
becoming. Against the &#8216;single vision&#8217; of mechanical materialism, Blake sought, 
and succeeded, to think co-existent &#8216;contrary states&#8217; and to marry heaven and 
hell. We must agree that Hegel was the vector through whom this tradition was 
transmitted to Marx, and we may agree that this transmission was an ambiguous 
inheritance and that Hegel&#8217;s attempt to objectify a mode of apprehension as laws 
was invalid. But this does not invalidate the mode of apprehension.</p>

<p class="fst">I am suggesting that Hegel obscures our vision. He gets between 
us and the light. If we set him aside, we may then more easily look directly at 
dialectics themselves.I am not certain what we shall see, except that it will 
certainly not be contradiction caught in a stationary pose. The attempt to see a 
logic inscribed within &#8216;natural&#8217; process itself has been disabling and 
misleading. But from another aspect, we seem to be offering a description, 
within the terms of logic, of the ways in which we apprehend this process.<a href="#n118" name="fn118" target="_self">[118]</a></p>

<p class="fst">I am certain only that this mode of apprehension of 
'double-edged, double-tongued&#8217; process is to be found in Marx and Engels&#8217; own 
practice. And (here I may speak confidently for others within &#8216;my&#8217; tradition) 
that in my own work as a historian I have repeatedly observed this kind of 
process, and have, in consequence, come to bring &#8216;dialectics&#8217;, not as this or 
that &#8216;law&#8217; but as a habit of thinking (in co-existing opposites or &#8216;contraries&#8217;) 
and as an expectation as to the logic of process, into my own analysis. How else 
are we to be prepared to understand the paradox that the apparent agent of 
socialist revolution, the CPSU (B), has become the organ which, above all, 
articulates and imposes upon the self-activating social and intellectual process 
of Russian society a system of <i>blockade?</i></p>

<p class="fst">The eviction of dialectics from the Althusserian system is 
deplorable, but it flows as a necessary consequence from the inner stasis of 
structuralism.<a href="#n119" name="fn119" target="_self">[119]</a>1 am less 
sure that there is much to be gained from giving to &#8216;the dialectic&#8217; elaborate 
logical and formal expression. We have often been told that Marx had a &#8216;method&#8217;, 
that this method lies somewhere in the region of dialectical reason, and that 
this constitutes the <i>essence</i> of Marxism. It is therefore strange that, 
despite many allusions, and several expressions of intent, Marx never wrote this 
essence down. Marx left many notebooks. He was nothing if not a self-conscious 
and responsible intellectual worker. If he had found the clue to the universe, 
he would have set a day or two aside to put it down. We may conclude from this 
that it was not written because <i>it could not be written</i>, any more than 
Shakespeare or Stendhal could have reduced their art to a clue. For it was not a 
method but a practice, and a practice learned through practising. So that, in 
this sense, dialectics can never be set down, nor learned by rote. They must be 
learned only by critical apprenticeship within the same practice.</p>

<p class="fst">We will take leave of this section with some different 
observations. I promised at the outset to eschew the method of swapping 
quotations from Marx. I am not interested in the defence of Marxism as an 
orthodoxy. But we cannot dismiss as irrelevant the question as to whether 
Althusser&#8217;s reading of Marx is &#8216;authorised&#8217; - whether indeed Marx&#8217;s work had 
been mis-recognised (as a &#8216;historicism&#8217;) when it was always a structuralism, 
offering premonitions of the Althusserian orrery. A sufficient way of answering 
this question will be to note several of the devices which Althusser employs to 
validate his reading, not only as truly orthodox but as <i>more</i> orthodox 
than Marx.</p>

<p class="fst">We have noted one device, in the &#8216;motor&#8217;: to <i>gloss</i> a text 
(&#8216;thesis of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>&#8217;) and to <i>invent</i> from this 
gloss a &#8216;basic Marxist proposition.&#8217; We have noted another, in the transmutation 
of analogies into concepts, and of analytic categories into substantive 
descriptions. A further essay could follow here on the Althusserian employment 
of &#8216;in the last instance.&#8217; The &#8216;last&#8217; instance (<i>in letzter Instanz</i>) may 
be variously rendered into English as &#8216;in the last analysis&#8217;, &#8216;in the (court of) 
last resort&#8217;, &#8216;ultimately&#8217;, &#8216;in the final judgement.&#8217; That fine Communist 
scholar, Dona Torr, working ten hundred miles outside of academia, who first 
translated and edited the <i>Selected Correspondence</i>, in 1934, in those 
incredibly dim days when (as we were assured by Eagleton, Anderson and a dozen 
others) <i>soidisant</i> British Marxists had nothing in their hands but a few 
impoverished polemical tracts - Dona Torr first rendered the passage in Engels&#8217;s 
letter to Bloch - that passage, which becomes the axle of Althusser&#8217;s oratory, 
but which, we recall, is abstracted from a letter which also supplies the script 
in which the old man is made to play a clown - she rendered it thus:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;According to the materialist conception of history the 
determining element in history is <i>ultimately</i> the production and 
reproduction in real life. More than this neither Marx nor I have ever 
asserted.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Thus <i>in letzter Instanz</i> appears first as &#8216;ultimately&#8217;, 
and, later in the letter, as &#8216;in the last resort.&#8217; And at the asterisk* Torr 
allowed herself one of her rare editorial intrusions: &#8216;*<i>Moment</i> - element 
in the dialectical process of becoming.&#8217; She was already, it seems, forty years 
ago, keeping a watchful eye on the horizon for the arrival of Althusser. This is 
what Althusser gives: &#8216;production is the determinant factor.'<a href="#n120" name="fn120" target="_self">[120]</a> 
(<i>EM.</i> 111) - &#8216;production&#8217; itself being another category which he and 
Balibar are intent to stabilise and re-ify. And how can a last <i>analysis</i> 
then become an &#8216;instance&#8217; at a &#8216;level&#8217;s a &#8216;political instance&#8217; or a &#8216;legal 
instance&#8217; assigned an operative indicative force by <i>La Structure a Dominanie</i>? 
What are we to make of Poulantzas&#8217;s definition: &#8216;By <i>mode of production</i> we 
shall designate ... a specific combination of various structures and practices, 
which, in combination, appears as so many instances and levels . . .&#8217;?<a href="#n121" name="fn121" target="_self">[121]</a> 
How can a mode of production appear as so many <i>instances</i> (analyses, 
judgements, last resorts) unless it has become a metaphysical mode, producing 
neither goods nor knowledge, but reproducing itself endlessly in differentiating 
levels and instances, engendering only theoretical famine? &#8216;But the truth is, 
they be not the highest instances that give the securest information&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;As may be well expressed in the tale so common of the 
philosopher, that while be gazed upwards to the stars fell into the water; for 
if he had looked down he might have seen the stars in the water, but looking 
aloft he could not see the water in the stars.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">We might describe this last device as &#8216;transplantation.&#8217; An organ 
of one argument is cut out and put into the side of another. A more familiar 
device has already been well described as &#8216;ventriloquism.&#8217;<a href="#n122" name="fn122" target="_self">[122]</a> 
Althusser rarely allows Marx to speak: when he does, he throws his own voice 
into Marx. Or, which is little different, he <i>produces</i> Marx; prepares the 
scene; rehearses the script; presents a cue; and then a few lines, proper to 
that moment of the scene, are permitted. Let us follow through one example. 
Althusser has noted, with delight, a <i>footnote</i> in <i>Capital</i> - and, 
moreover, a note only to be found in the French edition &#8212; defining the word 
&#8216;process&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The word &#8216;proems&#8217; (process) which expresses <i>a development 
considered in the totality of its real conditions</i> has long been part of 
scientific language throughout Europe. In France it was first introduced 
slightly shamefacedly in its Latin form - <i>processus.</i> Then, stripped of 
this pedantic disguise, it slipped into books on chemistry, physics, physiology, 
etc., and into works of metaphysics. In the end it will obtain a certificate of 
complete naturalization.&quot; (<i>L. &amp;' P.</i> 117; P. <i>&amp; H.</i> 185).</p>

<p class="fst">The production requires at this point that Marx should speak a 
few lines to authorise Althusser&#8217;s thesis of history as a &#8216;process without a 
subject&#8217;; moreover, he wishes to catch the word &#8216;process&#8217; (which the 
knowledgeable reader will know that Marx used rather freely) and put it under 
arrest. If historical process can be defined as &#8216;a development considered in the 
totality of its real conditions&#8217; then it can be put back <i>inside</i> 
structure, as a mechanism to turn the orrery around. One way (an honest way) of 
approaching this question might have been through examining Marx&#8217;s arguments in <i>
Capital</i> at some central places in the text. But Althusser prefers a footnote 
limited to the French edition. He offers these lines as his authority. Why, 
then, did Marx choose such an obscure way to express a point of such importance? 
A chauvinist reply would be: &#8216;Because only the French reader could have the 
logic to comprehend a point so nice.&#8217; But Althusser, at this point, is no 
chauvinist; he has a better argument - it was only the three or four years 
interval which had elapsed since the publication of <i>Capital</i> in German 
which had permitted Marx to clarify his own thought, &#8216;which had allowed him to 
grasp the importance of this category and to express it to himself.&#8217; (<i>L. &amp; P</i> 
117)</p>

<p class="fst">This is the production; it is superb. But the producer gets 
little assistance from his script; the dramatist has nodded. For the note 
defines <i>the word</i> &#8216;process&#8217;, as employed indifferently within works of 
chemistry, physics, physiology and metaphysics. The note says nothing, 
absolutely nothing, about how Marx sets the word to <i>work,</i> about Marx&#8217;s 
notion of <i>historical</i> process (for this we must refer to his books). And 
it is self-evident from the note that it has been inserted in the French edition 
because the word has not yet been allowed &#8216;naturalization&#8217;, is unfamiliar in 
political and economic theory (or so Marx supposes), possibly because it 
offended against the fixity of categories in French logic, possibly because 
French intellectuals scrutinise with care the credentials of alien conceptual 
intruders before they are permitted familiar access to their discourse. And I do 
not say this in criticism of the French. British intellectuals, so anxious to 
&#8216;Europeanise&#8217; themselves, might learn something here from the caution of the 
French. There are some recent intruders - &#8216;conjuncture&#8217;, &#8216;overdetermination&#8217;, 
&#8216;instance&#8217;, &#8216;structure-in-dominance&#8217; - whose certificates of naturalization 
should be refused.</p>

<p class="fst">We have noted these devices: invention: transmutation of 
analogies into concepts: improper conceptual transplants: &#8216;ventriloquism&#8217; or 
&#8216;production&#8217;. The most general device, however, is the employment of readings 
which are partial or which are wholly misleading, and in ways which cannot be 
&#8216;innocent&#8217;. As a final example, we will follow one of these. We have already 
noted that Althusser, at an important place in his argument, cites the authority 
of <i>The Poverty of Philosophy</i>, Marx&#8217;s polemic (in 1847) against Proudhon:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;How, indeed, could the single logical formula of movement, of 
sequence, of time, explain the body of society, in which all economic relations 
co-exist simultaneously and support one another?&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This appears, as we have seen (p. 126), at a critically-important 
stage of his argument for a structurally-synchronic mode of analysis. I do not 
think that there is any other text of Marx&#8217;s which he works harder. This text is 
his licence to own an orrery. It is employed at at least four significant points 
in <i>Reading Capital</i> (<i>R.C.</i> 65, 66, 98, 107); it is &#8216;rigorously 
expressed&#8217;, and in &#8216;those few lucid sentences&#8217; Marx &#8216;warns us that he is looking 
not for an understanding of the mechanism of the production of society as a <i>
result</i> of history, but for an understanding of the mechanism of the 
production of the <i>society effect</i> by this result.&#8217; (<i>R.C.</i> 66) These 
sentences, in a work which comes directly after the &#8216;epistemological break&#8217; - 
one of the first utterances of the &#8216;mature&#8217; Marx - are indeed of &#8216;absolutely 
decisive scope&#8217;, they direct us to the essence of his revolution in Theory, his 
discovery of &#8216;science.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">It is not clear why this is so, but it is clear that the sentence 
must be supported by its context. To this we must return. The context is chapter 
two of <i>The Poverty of Philosophy</i>, entitled &#8216;The Metaphysics of Political 
Economy&#8217;, and commencing with some observations on method. What has most annoyed 
Marx in <i>La Philosophie de la Misere</i> is Proudhon&#8217;s pretention to a new 
metaphysical method: &#8216;We are not giving a <i>history according to the order in 
time</i>, but <i>according to the sequence of ideas?</i> In place of the 
sequence of actual history, Proudhon proposes to develop economic theories in 
&#8216;their <i>logical sequence</i> and their <i>serial relation in the 
understanding',</i> it is this order that we flatter ourselves to have 
discovered.&#8217; (Proudhon, cited in C. <i>W.</i> VI, 162) Marx&#8217;s several 
observations develop, most emphatically, different aspects of the same 
objection: the metaphysical and unhistorical character of Proudhon&#8217;s method. 
Bourgeois economists have developed &#8216;the division of labour, credit, money, 
etc., as fixed, immutable, eternal categories&#8217;, but &#8216;they do not explain . . . 
the historical movement that gave them birth.&#8217; Proudhon takes these categories 
(from the economists) as given, and wishes to put them into a new sequential 
order, a serial relation in the understanding:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The economists&#8217; material is the active, energetic life of 
man; M. Proudhon&#8217;s material is the dogmas of the economists. But the moment we 
cease to pursue the historical movement of production relations, of which the 
categories are but the theoretical expression ... we are forced to attribute the 
origin of these thoughts to the movement of pure reason.&quot; (Ibid. 162)</p>

<p class="fst">This Marx sees as the heresy of metaphysics. Everything is 
presented, not in the analysis of social and historical reality, but as a 
sequence of abstracted logical categories:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Thus the metaphysicians who, in making these abstractions, 
think they are making analyses, and who, the more they detach themselves from 
things, imagine themselves to be getting all the nearer to the point of 
penetrating to their core - these metaphysicians in turn are right in saying 
that things here below are embroideries of which the logical categories 
constitute the canvas.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">(We sit uncomfortably, and remember &#8216;society effect', and men as <i>
trager.</i> embroideries upon the canvas of structure). Marx thunders on:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If all that exists, all that lives on land and under water 
can be reduced by abstraction to a logical category - if the whole real world 
can be drowned thus in a world of abstractions, in the world of logical 
categories - who need be astonished at all?</p>

<p class="quoteb">All that exists, all that lives on land and under water, 
exists and lives only by some kind of movement&quot; (Ibid. 163)</p>

<p class="fst">Proudhon has at least noticed this. And he seeks to enclose 
movement within his categories by means of a crude deployment of the Hegelian 
dialectic. But what he has done is to abstract movement itself into a series of 
logical categories:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Apply this method to the categories of political economy, and 
you have the logic and metaphysics of political economy, or, in other words, you 
have the economic categories that everybody knows translated into a Httle-known 
language which makes them look as if they had newly blossomed forth in an 
intellect of pure reason; so much do these categories seem to engender one 
another, to be linked up and intertwined with one another by the very working of 
the dialectic movement.&quot; (Ibid. 165)</p>

<p class="fst">We are now beginning to understand why Althusser held his hand so 
firmly over the text of <i>The Poverty of Philosophy</i>, and allowed us only to 
peep through his fingers at one single sentence. But if we are to understand the 
context of this sentence, and, therefore, Marx&#8217;s meaning, we have to turn back 
for a moment from chapter two (&#8216;The Method&#8217;) to chapter one, where Marx makes an 
entry directly into the question of Proudhon&#8217;s concept of value. Proudhon seeks 
to explain the genesis of exchange value, not in its real historical genesis, 
but in its genesis within a sequence of logical categories: the &#8216;history&#8217; is 
that of the genesis of <i>ideas</i> in &#8216;serial relation in the understanding.&#8217; 
Proudhon presents this sequence in this kind of way:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Since a very large number of the things I need occur in 
nature only in moderate quantities, or even at all, I am forced to assist in the 
production of what I lack. And as I cannot set my hand to so many things, I 
shall <i>propose</i> to other men, my collaborators in various functions, to 
cede to me a part of their products in <i>exchange</i> for mine.&quot; (Proudhon, 
cited in Ibid. Ill)</p>

<p class="fst">(As Marx remarks elsewhere, this is a characteristic 
petit-bourgeois notion of economic relations: the T is a little master hatter or 
brass-founder, who would exchange in this way if the State, taxation, feudal 
privilege, did not intervene.)<a href="#n123" name="fn123" target="_self">[123]</a> 
From this &#8216;logical sequence&#8217; (a &#8216;history', but a history only in ideas, or 
ideology) Proudhon derives the division of labour. As Marx remarks, &#8216;A man&#8217; sets 
out to <i>&#8216;propose</i> to other men . . .' that they establish exchange,&#8217; but 
Proudhon has not explained the genesis of this proposal, &#8216;how this single 
individual, this Robinson, suddenly had the idea of making &#8216;to his 
collaborators&#8217; a proposal, of the type <i>known</i> and how these collaborators 
accepted it without the slightest protest.&#8217; (Ibid. 112) This is a sample of what 
Proudhon describes as his &#8216;historical and descriptive method&#8217; (Ibid. 113). The 
logical sequence of categories, one engendering the next in series, may then be 
placed within a small balloon named T, and this balloon may then be puffed up 
with rhetoric until it has become &#8216;the impersonal reason of humanity', or, at 
another place, &#8216;Prometheus&#8217;, who, &#8216;emerging from the bosom of nature&#8217;, sets to 
work, and &#8216;on this first day&#8217;, his product &#8216;is equal to ten&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;On the second day, Prometheus divides his labour, and his 
product becomes equal to a hundred. On the third day . . . Prometheus invents 
machines, discovers new utilities in bodies, new forces in nature . . .&quot; 
(Proudhon, cited in Ibid. 157)</p>

<p class="fst">But (we scarcely need to rehearse Marx&#8217;s critique) this is to 
invert the real historical sequence:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Labour is organised, is divided differently according to the 
instruments it has at its disposal. The hand-mill presupposes a different 
division of labour from the steam-mill. Thus it is slapping history in the face 
to want to begin with the division of labour in general, in order to arrive 
subsequently at a specific instrument of production, machinery.&quot; (Ibid. 183)</p>

<p class="fst">In this sense, it is the machine which (historically) &#8216;discovers&#8217; 
the division of labour and determines its particular forms. <a href="#n124" name="fn124" target="_self">
[124]</a> We cannot usefully discuss the production of wealth &#8216;without the 
historical conditions in which it was produced.&#8217; Put this &#8216;Prometheus&#8217; back into 
history, and what does it turn out to be?</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is society, social relations based on class antagonism. 
These relations are not relations between individual and individual, but between 
worker and capitalist, between farmer and landlord, etc. Wipe out these 
relations and you annihilate all society . . .&quot; (Ibid. 159)</p>

<p class="fst">Thus the whole of <i>The Poverty of Philosophy</i>, a remarkable 
and cogent polemic, is a set of variations upon the theme of Proudhon&#8217;s 
unhistorical metaphysics. This gives us the context, and hence the meaning, of 
Althusser&#8217;s one sentence &#8216;licence.&#8217; Economic categories are &#8216;the abstractions of 
the social relations of production.&#8217; (Ibid. 165) But these relations are 
continually in movement, and the categories themselves are &#8216;<i>historical and 
transitory products</i>&#8217;. Proudhon seeks to wrest the categories from their 
context, eternise them, and then re-order them as a serial relation in the 
understanding. (Ibid. 166) He does not wish to present &#8216;history according to the 
order in time.&#8217; This &#8216;real history&#8217; is, in Proudhon&#8217;s view, only the &#8216;historical 
sequence in which the categories have <i>manifested</i> themselves.&#8217; (Ibid. 169) 
But we can improve upon real history &#8216;by taking the economic categories . . . 
successively, one by one . . .&#8217; (Ibid. 168) As a result, for Proudhon, 
&#8216;everything happened in the <i>pure ether of reason</i> (Ibid. 169) But we 
cannot detach <i>economic</i> categories from their context in this way, since 
&#8216;the production relations of every society form a whole.&#8217; Proudhon&#8217;s serial 
relation of categories in the understanding leads him to consider &#8216;economic 
relations as so many social phases, engendering one another, resulting one from 
the other like the antithesis from the thesis, and realising in their logical 
sequence the impersonal reason of humanity.&#8217; But we cannot analyse productive 
relations, economic relations, as this kind of series, since ail the relations 
(and the categories) coexist and presuppose each other. We must take these 
together as one set. To arrive at value, Proudhon &#8216;could not do without division 
of labour, competition, etc. Yet in the <i>series</i> ... in the <i>logical 
sequence</i>, these relations did not yet exist&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In constructing the edifice of an ideological system by means 
of the categories of Political Economy, the limbs of the social system are 
dislocated. The different limbs of society are converted into so many separate 
societies, following one upon the other. <i>How, indeed, could the single 
logical formula of movement, of sequence, of time, explain the structure of 
society, in which all relations coexist simultaneously and support one another?</i>&quot; 
(Ibid. 166-7: my italics)</p>

<p class="fst">We have arrived at last at Althusser&#8217;s talisman, the jewel of 
&#8216;absolutely decisive scope.&#8217; But Marx has not finished. In the next observations 
he posts on. Proudhon has dislocated the &#8216;limbs&#8217; of the social system, and given 
these as separate &#8216;societies&#8217; - production, exchange, a monetary system, 
distribution - following one upon the other in a logical, categorical sequence. 
We have to reconstitute these limbs, and see them as acting together. But how 
are we to do this, unless within &#8216;real history&#8217;, the history within which these 
relations were engendered? When we do this, we return once again to the point of 
origin of the economists&#8221; material, &#8216;the active, energetic life of man.&#8217; And 
when we do so, the illusion of bourgeois economics - that society is the effect 
of categories, and that men are the carriers of structures - is at last 
dispelled:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We are necessarily forced to examine minutely what men were 
like in the eleventh century, what they were like in the eighteenth, what were 
their respective needs, their productive forces, their mode of production, the 
raw materials of their production - in short, what were the relations between 
man and man which resulted from all these conditions of existence. To get to the 
bottom of all these questions - what is this but to draw up the real, profane 
history of men in every century and to present these men as both the authors and 
the actors of their own drama?&quot; (Ibid. 170)</p>

<p class="fst">Does the point need explaining further? Arguments, as well as 
production relations, form a whole. We cannot sever one limb, and that limb a 
tiny one (one sentence), the upper joint of a little finger. Marx&#8217;s argument is 
at no point an argument against &#8216;historicism&#8217;; it is an argument for integrative 
historical analysis against the disintegrative '<i>single</i> logical formula&#8217; 
of Proudhon, as a serial relation of categories. Moreover, we can now understand 
Althusser&#8217;s silence as to the substantial arguments of <i>The Poverty of 
Philosophy.</i> For the &#8216;heresies&#8217; which Althusser wishes to unmask - the heresy 
of &#8216;empiricism&#8217; (&#8216;to examine minutely what men were like&#8217;), the heresy of 
&#8216;historicism&#8217; (&#8216;the real, profane history of men&#8217;), and the heresy of &#8216;humanism&#8217; 
(&#8216;as both the authors and the actors of their own drama&#8217;) - these heresies do 
not appear merely as the momentary &#8216;blank of suspended rigour, scarcely the time 
of a lightning-flash in the darkness of the text&#8217; (see p. 141) - these are 
integral to the text, they <i>are</i> the argument, they <i>are</i> the thunder 
and the lightning which are hurled against Proudhon&#8217;s darkness.</p>

<p class="fst">Moreover, it is only necessary to perform one small operation 
upon Marx&#8217;s text - by changing at every point the name of Proudhon to Althusser 
- and it may be read as a sustained premonitory polemic against the latter&#8217;s 
&#8216;Theory&#8217;. It is true that Althusser has replaced Proudhon&#8217;s sequential logic 
with an inconsequential logic. But the polemic strikes home every time: the 
fixity of categories; the engenderment of categories from pure reason rather 
than through historical analysis; the metaphysical heresy, categories 
engendering society and men as their effects; the mystifying &#8216;novelty&#8217; of the 
vocabulary; the reorganisation of real history into a more proper categorical 
logic, &#8216;as the development of forms&#8217; (structure swallowing process); the 
disintegrative method which separates a whole into &#8216;limbs&#8217; (&#8216;levels&#8217;, 
&#8216;instances&#8217;); and the manipulation of these limbs in an ether of pure reason 
independently of the specificities of historical time and class. In going to the 
office of authority, and taking out this text, M. Althusser has made a big 
mistake. What he supposed was a licence to entertain the public with his orrery 
was in fact a court order to put down his own dog, &#8216;theoretical practice&#8217;. And 
the order is signed, &#8216;Karl Marx.&#8217; And the order must be executed, instantly, by 
the public, if Althusser refuses. For the dog has bitten philosophy and 
sociology already, and made them mad.</p>

<p class="fst">A final observation. We will propose it in the form of a 
question. How does Althusser have the <i>neck?</i></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h13">xiii</a></h3>

<p class="fst">So many pages! And yet we have only traced two of Althusser&#8217;s 
ogres, &#8216;historicism&#8217; and &#8216;empiricism&#8217;, to their lairs. Somewhere in the forest 
those even more hideous monsters, &#8216;humanism&#8217; and &#8216;moralism&#8217;, still lurk. But I 
do not think that we will need so many pages to find them. As we have seen (p. 
49), a ball rolls down the hill through its own innate energy and will. All of 
Althusser&#8217;s subsequent propositions roll down in the same way, once he has 
placed them on this idealist summit.</p>

<p class="fst">It should also be clear, by now, that these propositions belong 
not to reason or to &#8216;science&#8217; but to ideology; and therefore we can despatch 
them somewhat more briskly. That men and women are not agents in their own 
history, but <i>trdger</i> - carriers of structures, vectors of process - must 
follow upon the concept of a &#8216;process without a subject.&#8217; To suppose otherwise 
is to fall into the sin of &#8216;humanism,&#8217; Althusser&#8217;s first elaborated anathema 
against this sin appeared in an article, &#8216;Marxism and Humanism&#8217;, in 1964. Why 
did it appear <i>then?</i></p>

<p class="fst">We shall see.</p>

<p class="fst">But to see we must make ourselves into historians for a moment. I 
am sure that my most critical readers will not accuse me of having confused, up 
to this moment, Theory with the sociology of ideology. Our critique has been 
&#8216;rigorous&#8217;, &#8216;within Theory&#8217; and its &#8216;discourse of the proof.&#8217; Well, most of the 
time. Not a syllable of the partisan or the personal has been allowed to 
intrude. Not often.</p>

<p class="fst">Now, however, we must not only admire Althusser&#8217;s orrery (which 
we shall continue to do) but ask also why it was made, and whom it was intended 
to entertain? But, first, <i>the text.</i></p>

<p class="fst">This is how it commences:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Today, Socialist &#8216;Humanism&#8217; is on the agenda.</p>

<p class="quoteb">As it enters the period which will lead it from socialism . . 
.to communism . . . the Soviet Union has proclaimed the slogan: All for Man, and 
introduced new themes: the freedom of the individual, respect for legality, the 
dignity of the person.&quot; (<i>KM. 221)</i></p>

<p class="fst">&#8216;This is a historical event', Althusser goes on. It is 
premonitory of a dialogue between Communists and men of goodwill &#8216;who are 
opposed to war and poverty. Today, even the high-road to Humanism seems to lead 
to socialism.&#8217; But this is only a <i>seeming.</i> In fact, humanism (&#8216;Man&#8217;) is a 
very foul bourgeois ideological concept, and one to which Marx himself was 
victim in his early manuscripts. He liberated himself from this concept in the 
course of his encounter with Feuerbach . . . the argument (the argument of 
Engels&#8217;s <i>Ludwig Feuerbach</i>) is too familiar to rehearse. Beneath the grand 
phrases of &#8216;humanity&#8217; was concealed the exploitation by the bourgeoisie of the 
proletariat. Hence revolutionary proletarian &#8216;humanism&#8217; could only be a &#8216;class 
humanism&#8217;: &#8216;for more than forty years, in the U.S.S.R., amidst gigantic 
struggles, &#8220;socialist humanism&#8221; was expressed in the terms of class dictatorship 
rather than in those of personal freedom.&#8217; (<i>FM</i>. 221) But &#8216;the end of the 
dictatorship of the proletariat in the U.S.S.R, opens up a second historical 
phase.&#8217;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In the U.S.S.R. men are indeed now treated without any class 
distinction, that is, as <i>persons.</i> So, <i>in ideology</i>; we see the 
themes of class humanism give way before the themes of a socialist humanism of 
the person.&quot; (<i>F.M. 222</i>)</p>

<p class="fst">Very nice. But, before we can order a stock of the same commodity 
for ourselves, we are sternly reminded that it is a product, not of Theory but 
of <i>ideology.</i> Ideology &#8216;is <i>as such an organic part of every social 
totality</i>&#8217;. Like it or not, even Socialist states must have &#8216;ideology.&#8217; 
&#8216;Human societies secrete ideology as the very element and atmosphere 
indispensable to their historical respiration and life.&#8217; (<i>F.M.</i> 232, 235) 
But this particular ideological stock cannot be exported from the U.S.S.R.; 
indeed, it is a seed carefully prepared only for Siberian conditions. The &#8216;world 
opening up before the Soviets&#8217; is one with &#8216;infinite vistas of progress, of 
science, of culture, of bread and freedom, of free development... a world that 
can do without shadows or tragedies.&#8217; (<i>EM.</i> 238) But that is their world, 
not ours: &#8216;the themes of socialist humanism (free development of the individual, 
respect for socialist legality, dignity of the person, etc.) are the way the 
Soviets and other socialists are <i>living</i> the relations between themselves 
and these problems, that is, the <i>conditions</i> in which they are posed.&#8217; (<i>EM.</i> 
238-9) If we live in different conditions, we cannot cultivate the same crops. 
In &#8216;China, etc.&#8217; only a &#8216;class humanism&#8217; can as yet be grown. (<i>EM.</i> 222) 
And what of the capitalist West? Very clearly the stock cannot be imported. For 
it would be transmogrified in the passage, and would spring up, in these 
conditions, as a virulent bourgeois crop of anti-Communism. It would come up, 
not as socialist at all, but as the old ideological notion of&#8216;Man&#8217;. For we must 
not forget for an instant the difference between ideology and sciences, and that 
&#8216;the frontier. separating ideology from scientific theory was crossed about one 
hundred and twenty years ago by Marx.&#8217; (<i>EM.</i> 246) &#8216;Strictly in respect to 
theory, therefore, one can and must speak of <i>Marx&#8217;s theoretical antihumanism.</i> 
. . (<i>EM.</i> 229)</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Simply put, the recourse to ethics so deeply inscribed in 
every humanist ideology may play the part of an imaginary treatment of real 
problems. Once <i>known</i>, these problems are posed in precise terms: they are 
organisational problems of the forms of economic life, political life and 
individual life.&quot; (<i>F. M.</i> 247)</p>

<p class="fst">These problems must be given <i>&#8216;their scientific names?</i> Thus 
we see that in <i>theory</i> (while it may do for the Soviet Union as ideology: 
i.e. rhetoric) &#8216;socialist humanism&#8217; is the old enemy; it is the couple, abstract 
&#8216;goodwill&#8217; (moralism) and &#8216;Man&#8217; (humanism) in partnership against real 
Communism.</p>

<p class="fst">Very nice, again. But who are the <i>träger</i> or vectors of 
these hideous ideological impurities? Can we envisage bourgeois &#8216;socialist 
humanism&#8217; <i>in corpore vile,</i> and give it a local habitation and a name? <i>
Who</i> is the ogre?</p>

<p class="fst">We shall see.</p>

<p class="fst">But, first, we must make two general observations on Althusser&#8217;s 
procedures. (1) There is a method of &#8216;theoretical practice&#8217; which I will 
described as <i>The Kangaroo Factor.</i> We have noted long ago (p. 47) that 
this kind of idealism, since it prohibits any actual empirical engagements with 
social reality, is delivered, bound and gagged, into the hands of the most 
vulgar empiricism. That is, since it cannot know the world, the world must be 
assumed in its premises. And what is that world but the most vulgar 
manifestations and prejudices of &#8216;what everyone knows&#8217;? Hence the theoretical 
practitioner proceeds in gigantic bounds through the conceptual elements, with 
the most gracious curvatures of thought; and while he is bounding he performs 
the most elegant acrobatic twirls and he paws the air with sublime gestures. But 
every so often (since the law of gravity cannot be disregarded for ever ) he 
comes down: <i>bump!</i> What he comes down upon is an assumption about the 
world. But he does not linger on this assumption, sniff it, taste the grass. <i>
Hop!</i> He is off into the air again.</p>

<p class="fst">I apologise. The analogy is grossly unfair to kangaroos, which 
bound forward with a purposive air to an objective, keep their paws tidily in 
place, and every now and then stop, eat, and survey the world. Theory hops 
onwards for ever, even through the Stalinist night.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course, if the reader shares already all of Althusser&#8217;s 
&#8216;common sense&#8217; - that the Soviet Union in 1964 was a land living the themes of 
dignity of the person, free development of the individual, respect for legality, 
etc. with &#8216;infinite vistas&#8217; of progress, a world &#8216;without shadows or tragedies&#8217; 
- then my analogy is wasted upon him. And he had better stop reading this essay, 
since these pearls are not for him.</p>

<p class="fst">We shall notice the <i>kangaroo factor</i> again.</p>

<p class="fst">(2) The second observation. Althusser&#8217;s theoretical practice may 
be defined as a contestation without an opponent.</p>

<p class="fst">Throughout <i>For Marx</i> and <i>Reading Capital</i> his 
antagonists are scarcely ever (unless in an allusion, a footnote) defined. The 
practice is that of monologue, not dialogue, <i>within</i> the corpus of Marxist 
concepts. But this is not strictly true. At a few points opponents <i>are,</i> 
defined, and these are: young Marx, Hegel, mature Marx (his blanknesses and 
failures of rigour), poor old Engels, and Gramsci. (I will not turn aside to 
defend that creative, but ambiguous, thinker; he does not require my defence, 
and he has defenders enough.) Apart from these moments of argument - an argument 
which is &#8216;produced&#8217; - we have, not particular ogres - antagonists who developed 
particular arguments in definite places - but a generic <i>ogreism.</i> We have 
&#8216;empiricism&#8217; without any empiricists, &#8216;historicism&#8217; without any attention to 
historians, and now we have &#8216;humanism&#8217; and &#8216;moralism&#8217; without any faces. But no 
matter: we cannot see these ogres for a very good reason: they are hidden within 
the dense undergrowth of the forest of &#8216;bourgeois ideology.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">But then a very strange thing occurs. Suddenly, in 1972, an ogre 
does shamble out of the forest, dazzled and confused in the unaccustomed 
daylight. Hurriedly, an orthodox Communist audience is gathered around. And 
then, in the arena of Theory, A supreme tournament is staged, with an <i>actual</i> 
antagonist: Dr. John Lewis.</p>

<p class="fst">And why should he choose <i>this</i> opponent? We shall see.</p>

<p class="fst">Who was John Lewis? It is Althusser&#8217;s whimsy (for even rigour may 
be allowed its little jokes) to offer him as a youngish philosopher - perhaps a 
&#8216;man of goodwill&#8217; who was <i>trying</i> to be a Marxist but who had not overcome 
the influence of Sartre<a href="#n125" name="fn125" target="_self">[125]</a> - 
and not, as he was, the elderly guardian of the tablets of the British Communist 
Party&#8217;s ideological law. Between 1945 and 1956, during the era of high 
Stalinism, Lewis was the editor of the party&#8217;s intellectual organ, <i>The Modern 
Quarterly</i>. The young are uncharitable, as I am now old enough to know. And 
no doubt I and my immediate friends in the Communist Party in those days took an 
uncharitable view of Lewis, in seeing him as a superintendent among &#8216;King 
Street&#8217;s' ideological police, along with Burns, Dutt, Garman, Klugmann and co. 
That is, in intellectual and cultural matters, he was two fixed points between 
which a &#8216;correct line&#8217; could always be drawn. His own speciality - and he gave 
himself a generous allowance of the journaPs pages - was homiletics on Communism 
and ethics, morality and humanism.</p>

<p class="fst">Now this seems, at first sight, to conform exactly to Althusser&#8217;s 
requirements: Lewis is taken as a triple personification of the ogre, 
&#8216;dogmatism&#8217;, the ogre &#8216;humanism&#8217;, <i>and</i> the ogre, &#8216;moralism.&#8217; These three 
ogres, of bourgeois origin, had slipped unobserved from their natural habitat, 
into the forest of <i>Stalinism</i>. In unmasking Lewis, Althusser is taking 
even further his long and rigorous project of unmasking the &#8216;Stalinian 
deviation.&#8217; And it is the easier for him to do this by selecting an elderly 
target in the British Communist Party (which the leaders of the PC.E have always 
despised) rather than an ogre in his own party which might always bite back. 
Moreover, Althusser is able to present himself as being way ahead of his own 
lagging timeSj in the <i>avant-garde</i> of Theory: &#8216;In <i>For Marx -</i> that 
is, in 1965 - I was already writing about Stalin, about the Twentieth Congress 
of the Soviet Communist Party, and about the split in the International 
Communist Movement. John Lewis, on the other hand, writes as if Stalin had never 
existed. . . (<i>Essays, 36)</i></p>

<p class="fst">But this is in fact not a tourney at all. It is a race, in the 
same direction, between two kangaroos. It is true that, while in the air, the 
kangaroos make different noises, in different national idioms; but since every 
other country is now allowed its own &#8216;national&#8217; Marxism, why should not 
&#8216;Anglo-Marxism&#8217; be allowed? If Franco-Marxism is permitted to utter, in 
Cartesian tones, the lemons of raison, why should Anglo-Marxism not emit, in the 
organ-tones of Unitarian or theosophist chapel, the homilies of moral man? But 
both kangaroos hop to the same rhythm, go the same way, and land from time to 
time, bump, on the same clumps of unexamined &#8216;common-sense&#8217; - the Party, 
Marxism-Leninism, and astounding illusions as to Soviet history and contemporary 
reality.</p>

<p class="fst">What Althusser is saying as to bourgeois &#8216;humanism&#8217; as ideology 
and as to proletarian &#8216;class humanism&#8217; (embodied in the dictatorship of the 
proletariat in the Soviet Union embodied in the Party guided by Marxist science) 
is, exactly, what Lewis was saying in the high Stalinist years, and saying 
repetitiously to the exclusion of all other themes. This was Lewis&#8217;s &#8216;thing.&#8217; In 
1946 (&#8216;The Great Moral Muddle&#8217;) he started off hopping at the same point at 
which Althusser commenced in 1964. &#8216;The soberest estimate of Soviet 
achievement&#8217;, based on the reports of &#8216;the most cautious investigators&#8217; reveal 
&#8216;a respect for personality, an achievement of freedom from want and insecurity, 
an equality of opportunity, that has filled the Soviet people with boundless 
confidence and hope.&#8217; But Lewis saw all this placed on the agenda as early as 
the new Soviet Constitution, in 1936, in which Stalin proclaimed the &#8216;equality 
of rights for citizens', secured by legal guarantees. He did not neglect to take 
us through the same Feuerbach routines. &#8216;Ethics can only be understood in terms 
of the class interests they are called upon to serve'; &#8216;to make an ideal 
effective it must become the ideal of a class, that is to say it must express 
the actual interest of a class.' (&#8216;Marxism and Ethics&#8217;, 1950). Thus we have 
Althusser&#8217;s &#8216;class humanism.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Hence also the new humanism of socialism realised. This does not 
arise &#8216;from metaphysical principles, or from the acceptance of some utopian 
ideal or set of abstract moral principles.&#8217; On the contrary, it must be seen, 
like Althusser&#8217;s &#8216;ideology&#8217;, as &#8216;the moral aspect of a particular mode of 
production.&#8217; This is the basis of &#8216;the new morality' in Russian. (&#8216;The Moral 
Complexion of Our People&#8217;, 1951). But, like Althusser again - for they are both 
still way up, in the air, at the apex of their graceful curve - there is the 
same stern prohibition upon the import, to the capitalist world, of &#8216;the new 
morality&#8217; in the form of abstract principles. &#8216;It is against the background of 
the complete moral collapse of bourgeois society that we have to put the bad 
conscience which projects all the wickedness of which it is guilty upon the new 
and nobler world that is coming to birth.' &#8216;The stalwart champions of eternal 
principles' must be exposed as wearing &#8216;class interests behind the mask of 
absolute values.'</p>

<p class="fst">But there is no need for the proletariat to wear this mask, for 
&#8216;the realisation of proletarian aims makes possible for the first time a truly 
human morality . . This is achieved &#8216;by means of a class victory, inspired by a 
class morality ... There is no other way in which a morality which is above 
classes can be realised.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">It is here that the gestures and tones of Lewis and Althusser 
(both still way up) diverge a little - the accents of raison and those of moral 
plenitude:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Because the workers know that in fighting for their own 
emancipation they are fighting for all mankind, the ethical drive behind their 
movement far exceeds both in purity and intensity that which inspired all 
preceding systems of class ethics and becomes one of the most potent of those 
energising and mobilising forces which, as Stalin has pointed out, play such a 
vital part in the development of society.&quot; (&#8216;Marxism and Ethics&#8217;).</p>

<p class="fst">Now both our moralists descend to the ground, and not very far 
from the point they started from. This ground, for Althusser, is a Soviet world 
&#8216;with infinite vistas of progress&#8217;, a world &#8216;that can do without shadows or 
tragedies.&#8217; True, they call this utopia by different names: for Althusser it is 
the world of Theory Realised, of Science Incarnate: for Lewis it is the world of 
Truly Human Man:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is because the leading members of the Soviet Commonwealth 
are imbued with a morality which leads them <i>to respect and care for people</i> 
that they succeeded in their great task. They owe much of this finely human 
attitude to Stalin, whose deep wisdom and broad humanity has long inspired the 
Party, as it now inspires the state of which he is the leader. His ethics and 
the whole of moral aim of the Soviet state are well summed up in his own. moving 
declaration of the supreme value of human personality. &#8216;Our leaders,&#8217; he says, 
&#8216;should display the most solicitous attitude towards our workers ... We must 
learn to value people ... It is time to realise that of all the valuable capital 
the world possesses, the most valuable and most decisive is people.&#8217; &quot; (The 
Moral Complexion of Our People&#8217;)</p>

<p class="fst">And when did Stalin say this? In his address to die Graduates 
from the Red Army Academy in 1935. How unfortunate it was that so many of these 
graduates turned out, in the next two years, to be, not &#8216;people&#8217; at all, but 
&#8216;alien elements&#8217;, the <i>trager</i> of capitalist conspiracy, who merited 
liquidation.<a href="#n126" name="fn126" target="_self">[126]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lewis, then, was a very parfit, gentle kangaroo. The rhetoric was 
different here and there (&#8216;man&#8217;/&#8216;masses&#8217;: socialist &#8216;ideology&#8217;/new morality); 
but the essential arguments and assumptions of both men were the same. How is 
it, then, that John Lewis should shamble, in 1972, as the ogre of&#8216;humanism&#8217; out 
of the forests of bourgeois ideology? And how is it that Althusser&#8217;s arguments, 
first commenced in 1964, may be presented as the initiation of a rigorous 
critique of the &#8216;Stalinian deviation&#8217;, while Lewis, presenting <i>the same 
arguments</i>, in the years between 1946 and 1956, should be seen as an exemplar 
of that deviation? And why does the whole tourney, and the ground on which it is 
fought, seem so unreal?</p>

<p class="fst">We shall see.</p>

<p class="fst">I am sorry to be so tedious. These last pages bore me 
inexpressibly. But I am trying to unravel a tangle of wool And I am trying to do 
this patiently, for the benefit of a generation which thinks itself to be 
&#8216;post-Stalinist (but which, very often, <i>is not</i>), whose &#8216;rigour&#8217; has 
enabled them to repudiate, along with &#8216;historicism&#8217;, the most elementary 
knowledge of the immediate past of the Communist movement, in Russia, in 
Britain, in France. This innocence is allowing them to be made, every day, the 
victim of a gigantic confidence trick, in which resurgent Stalinism presents 
itself as Anti-Stalinism, and in which the long, explicit, and arduous critique 
of Stalinism sustained in a thousand places and a thousand struggles on the Left 
is presented as &#8216;bourgeois ideology.&#8217; The tourney between these identical twins, 
dogmatism and <i>dogmatisms,</i> was faked up by Althusser to further this 
trick.</p>

<p class="fst">It is all done by mirrors. We have been drawn into an 
illusionist&#8217;s parlour. Let us return again to the 1964 article: why did 
Althusser then find it necessary to demystify &#8216;socialist humanism&#8217;? Was it 
because of some grave error already committed by John Lewis? No: so far as I 
know, Lewis was not in the habit of coupling those words. But the words stir a 
faint memory in my mind. For there were other people, a lot of other people in 
leading positions in the international Communist movement who were denouncing 
&#8216;socialist humanism&#8217; between 1956 and 1964. Thus I recall Arnold Kettle, the 
token representative of British Culture on the executive of the British 
Communist Party, denouncing &#8216;middle class people . . . spouting a lot of pious 
generalisations about socialist humanism.&#8217;<a href="#n127" name="fn127" target="_self">[127]</a> 
By these middle class people he can scarcely have been referring to himself, nor 
to John Lewis, nor even to Althusser, who was, in 1964, to give muted approval 
to the term - but only as <i>ideology</i>, and only in the Soviet Union.<a href="#n128" name="fn128" target="_self">[128]</a> 
On every side the mirrors reflect back upon each other; but every one is empty; 
in none is any actual ogre to be seen.</p>

<p class="fst">And then, as I screw up my eyes, and gaze intently in the nearest 
mirror, the terrible realisation comes. There I am staring into the bloated 
visage and bared fangs of the most hideous of ogres. And it is myself! M. 
Althusser has done me the incomparable tribute of addressing an article to <i>
me!</i></p>

<p class="fst">Readers will pardon the egotism of this hyperbole. Of course we 
cannot suppose that a publication emanating from Yorkshire would have been 
attended to in Paris. But I was, from 1957, coeditor of a journal, <i>The New 
Reasoner</i>, subtitled &#8216;A Quarterly Journal of Socialist Humanism'. And in the 
first number of that journal I was the author of a long, immature, but not, I 
think, radically mistaken article on &#8216;Socialist Humanism&#8217;, which was, very 
specifically, a critique of Stalinist ideology and practice.<a href="#n129" name="fn129" target="_self">[129]</a> 
It was part of an international discourse, and, if it did not reach Paris, it 
certainly reached Moscow. For I received more than one tribute from Soviet 
theorists. This in <i>Oktober</i> (1958) I was singled out for special 
commendation:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;One of these crusaders ... is Edgar Thompson, the 
acknowledged leader of the British revisionists, <i>one-time</i> editor of <i>
The Reasoner</i>, the journal which fell into oblivion so quickly. [It was 
ordered to cease by the E.C. of the British C.P. E.P.T.], and now editor of <i>
The New Reasoner</i> which has its inglorious existence today. . .&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">My article on &#8216;Socialist Humanism&#8217; was particularly noted: 
&#8216;Thompson repeats slanders which ... are served up in one form or another by 
revisionists of all shades.&#8217;<a href="#n130" name="fn130" target="_self">[130]</a> 
In <i>Novy Mir</i> (1958) the tributes were even more touching. The journal of 
&#8216;Socialist Humanism&#8217; was noted as being conducted by a &#8216;group of renegades&#8217;: 
&#8216;the venal scribblers writing in the reactionary imperialist press could well 
sue the author for plagiarism: Thompson assiduously rehashes their fantasies 
about &#8216;Stalinism&#8217;, &#8216;Zhdanovism&#8217;, about the suppression of the individual in the 
U.S.S.R.; fervently he calls for nothing less than a &#8220;revolt&#8221; against Soviet 
ideology: &#8216;Like all traitors . . . like all renegades and anarchists&#8217;, H. 
Thompson uses the term socialist humanism as -</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;A smoke-screen ... to proclaim the identity of proletarian 
class morals with &#8216;an administrative, bureaucratic, despotic attitude to human 
beings.&#8217; Calling for a revolt &#8216;against inhumanity&#8217; this philosophizing slanderer 
in every possible way counterposes the abstract &#8216;man in general&#8217; to society, to 
the collective, to the communist party. Far-reaching claims for some kind of 
allegedly new &#8216;socialist humanism&#8217; are concluded with the following declaration: 
&#8216;It is <i>humanism</i> because it places once again real men and women at the 
centre of socialist theory and aspiration instead of the resounding abstractions 
- the Party, Marxism-Lemnism-Stalinism, the Two Camps, the Vanguard of the 
Working Class - so dear to Stalinism.&#8217; &#8221;<a href="#n131" name="fn131" target="_self">[131]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Perhaps - since ogres are notorious for their vanity - I may 
quote also the next sentence (neglected by <i>Novy Mir</i>) - which exposes my 
hideous project even further: &#8216;It is <i>socialist</i> because it re-affirms the 
revolutionary perspectives of Communism, faith in the revolutionary 
potentialities not only of the Human Race or of the Dictatorship of the 
Proletariat but of real men and women.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">There my face is, hideous, contorted with renegade malice, 
drooling with bourgeois spittle. We might notice also that Mr Ozerov, the gifted 
theorist of <i>Novy Mir</i>, had anticipated Althusser&#8217;s method of exposure: 
&#8216;this philosophizing slanderer . . . counterposes the abstract &#8220;man in general&#8221; 
to society . . .&#8217; - although, as it happens, I had counterposed &#8216;real men and 
women&#8217; to the abstractions to dear to Stalinism. My premises were &#8216;men, not in 
any fantastic isolation or definition, but in their actual, empirically 
perceptible process of development under definite conditions.&#8217;<a href="#n132" name="fn132" target="_self">[132]</a> 
And quite a lot of those men, under the abstract draperies of Marxist orthodoxy, 
were already dead.</p>

<p class="fst">So let us stop fooling and picking: the wool has come free. I do 
not know who first revived &#8216;socialist humanism&#8217; as the motto of the Communist 
libertarian opposition in 1956, although certainly <i>The New Reasoner</i> 
carried it to some parts of the English-speaking world. But it arose 
simultaneously in a hundred places, and on ten thousand lips. It was voiced by 
poets in Poland, Russia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia; by factory delegates in 
Budapest; by Communist militants at the eighth plenum of the Polish Party; by a 
Communist premier (Imre Nagy), who was murdered for his pains. It was on the 
lips of women and men coming out of gaol and of the relatives and friends of 
those who never came out.</p>

<p class="fst">After November 4th, 1956, when Soviet forces blasted into 
Budapest, there was initiated a general disciplinary action through the 
international Communist movement: to re-impose the disciplinary controls of 
State or Party, to re-establish ideological orthodoxy - in effect, to 
reconstruct, within changed conditions, Stalinism without Stalin. This 
proceeded, in differing circumstances and different countries, at a different 
pace and in different forms; in one place, a palpable police action (Nagy shot, 
Tibor Dery gaoled, anti-Stalinist militants of the Budapest Workers Councils one 
or the other); in another place, the expulsion of &#8216;revisionists&#8217;, the closure of 
dissident journals, the re-establishment of the most rigid Stalinist norms of 
democratic centralism. Alongside this, of course, there was an ideological 
police action. The 'main enemy&#8217; was seen to be, not Trotskyism (which was a 
subordinate tendency within the opposition), but &#8216;revisionism&#8217;, &#8216;renegades&#8217;, 
&#8216;petty bourgeois elements&#8217;, and their ideological virus was identified as 
&#8216;moralism&#8217; and as - &#8216;socialist humanism.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Thus we can see the emergence of Althusserianism as a 
manifestation of a general police action within ideology, as the attempt to 
reconstruct Stalinism at the level of theory. This is not to say (things are 
never as simple as that) that the leaders of the French Communist Party 
immediately appointed Althusser as chief of ideological police. They distrusted <i>
all</i> philosophy, as an infected area; Althusser&#8217;s language was difficult, and 
his &#8216;rigour&#8217; (&#8216;theoretical anti-humanism&#8217;) deprived them of some antique 
rhetoric - for the special virtuosity of the older kangaroo consisted in 
demonstrating (with apt quotations from Stalin) that <i>whatever</i> happened in 
the Communist world constituted a Victory for Man. John Lewis has shown us that. 
It was only after <i>Reading Capital</i> (1965) - and after a sharp dispute - 
that an understanding was come to, and that Waldeck Rochet, the 
Secretary-General of the P.C.F., spent a long day (June, 1966) with Althusser, 
&#8216;talking about Spinoza.&#8217; (<i>Essays,</i> 104) This understanding reproduced an 
old project of the Enlightenment. The absolute monarch (the Party) agreed to be 
enlightened by the <i>philosophe</i> (Theory).<a href="#n133" name="fn133" target="_self">[133]</a> 
The price of the pact, for Althusser, may be seen in a little subsequent 
tinkering with his orrery (ambiguous confessions of &#8216;theoreticism&#8217;), in the 
increasing brutality of his formulations (RSAs and ISAs, &#8216;philosophy as class 
struggle&#8217;) and in his posturings as a veteran militant of true class war, 
smelling of the cordite of innumerable arduous contestations with bourgeois 
heresy.&#8217;<a href="#n134" name="fn134" target="_self">[134]</a> And also - and 
here is the parlour of mirrors - with 'dogmatism&#8217; and Stalinism.</p>

<p class="fst">I am concerned, in this essay, with theory. I will comment 
further on the actual history in another place.<a href="#n135" name="fn135" target="_self">[135]</a> 
But I am entitled, as I think, to locate this particular theoretical problem in 
this way In terms of chronological time (which, as we know, is &#8216;ideological&#8217;) M. 
Althusser is some six years older than me. But in true, structural, theoretical 
time, I am (by the same number of years) his political senior. I joined the 
Communist Party in 1942, at the age of eighteen. Althusser joined the PC.F in 
1948, at the age of thirty. I know nothing about his prior history (which is 
irrelevant to Theory), except that he was &#8216;active&#8217; as a member of the Jeunes 
Etudiants Catholiques. His initiation into the Communist movement came at a time 
when the voluntarism of the anti-fascist war and the Resistance was receding, 
and the rival structures (political and ideological) of the Cold War had 
congealed. The whiff of cordite which is brought to us in his reminiscent 
allusions is not that of men &#8216;making history&#8217; but that of &#8216;the Stockholm Appeal 
and of the Peace Movement&#8217; (<i>EM.</i> 22) - that is, of a period in which the 
necessary struggle for peace was fought by the blind on a ground of falsehood 
and under the banner of illusion. When the illusions were finally dispelled, in 
1956, it was Althusser&#8217;s business to sew up people&#8217;s eyes and block their ears, 
to put the whole corrupt structure of falsehood back in a more sophisticated 
form.</p>

<p class="fst">I was never deceived by this structure for an instant. Nor were 
my comrades and friends. We knew it of old, we knew it <i>all too well</i> 
Althusser was (for us) the ancient enemy, the reasons of Stalinist power. But to 
a &#8216;post-Stalinist generation&#8217; the trick is passed. This rigorous critic of 
&#8216;dogmatism&#8217;, &#8216;economism&#8217; (supply as required), almost on his own (<i>Essays</i>, 
84), set himself the arduous task of restoring Marxist science; &#8216;<i>already</i>&quot;, 
in 1965, he was &#8216;writing about Stalin&#8217; (Ibid. 36). By 1972 he was able, at 
&#8216;personal risk&#8217;, to advance a &#8216;hypothesis&#8217; as to a &#8216;Stalinian deviation&#8217; (Ibid. 
89, etc.).</p>

<p class="fst">&#8216;Already&#8217;, in 1965! <i>So where was Althusser in 1956?</i> We 
know the answer. In truth, this &#8216;already&#8217; should make me uncomfortable as well, 
as it should all penitent kangaroos: if 1956, why not 1953, 1948, etc.? But how 
was Althusser&#8217;s &#8216;critique&#8217; so unaccountably postponed? In 1956 it was, at 
length, officially &#8216;revealed&#8217; that Stalinism had, for decades, been swatting 
down men like flies - Communists and non-Gommunists alike - and, after a further 
nine years, Althusser coughed, came out of his rigorous meditation, and muttered 
&#8216;dogmatism&#8217;; after a further seven years, he coughed again, and risked the 
hypothesis of a &#8216;deviation&#8217; (&#8216;the posthumous revenge of the Second 
International&#8217;!!) (<i>Essays,</i> 89); two or three years later, and he had a 
few severe words to say about Zhdanov and Lysenko.<a href="#n136" name="fn136" target="_self">[136]</a> 
But, on the other side of his face, he has been altogether more voluble and 
incomparably more severe. The main enemy has been - socialist humanism.</p>

<p class="fst">And yet, socialist humanism was, above all, the voice of a 
Communist opposition, of a total critique of Stalinist practice and theory. How 
on earth could the Althusserian illusion have been passed, even for an instant? 
It had to be supported by other illusions, each of them mirrors of the first. We 
have time now to admire only three. First, there was the ancient trick (itself a 
circle of mirrors) which identified all opposition as, by definition, 
&#8216;objectively&#8217;, the voice of reactionary imperialism. Proposition I; these 
critics attack the Party, Marxism, etc. Proposition 2: but the Party <i>is</i> 
the ultimate good, the guarantee of Theory, etc. Proposition 3: therefore these 
critics are enemies of all that is good and objectively they are imperialist 
swine. Thus the high theory of <i>Novy Mir</i>: thus Althusser - criticism of 
Stalinism, unless in terms prescribed by his theory, stems from &#8216;the most 
violent bourgeois anti-Communism and Troskyist anti-Stalinism&#8217; (<i>Essays</i>, 
82-3) Q.E.D.</p>

<p class="fst">Second, reflected across the parlour, the criticism is 
&#8216;bourgeois&#8217; - &#8216;middle class people&#8217; spouting about socialist humanism. This 
criticism is most commonly found on the spouting lips of middle class people 
(Althusser, Kettle). As a characterisation of the social complexion of the 
Communist opposition in 1956 it is a direct lie. It was not more true of the 
workers of Poznan, of the spontaneous councils of Budapest, than it was to be of 
the initiatives for &#8216;socialism with a human face&#8217; in Czechoslovakia in 1968<a href="#n137" name="fn137" target="_self">[137]</a> 
Nor was it true for those who composed the &#8216;party&#8217; of socialist humanism in 
Britain in 1956. For the veteran leader of the Derbyshire miners, Bert Wynn, 
solidarity with our critique meant (as for many others) severing connections 
within his own heart; for the full-time organiser of the Leeds Communist Party, 
Jim Roche, formulating the positions of socialist humanism meant getting out his 
tools and returning to the cutter&#8217;s bench; for the pit delegate from Ballingry, 
Lawrence Daly, it involved a critique not only in theory but in political 
practice, as he initiated the Fife Socialist League, and carried the 
highly-politically-conscious miners of West Fife along in its own &#8216;discourse&#8217; of 
agitation; for the shop stewards&#8221; convenor at Briggs Motor Bodies (Dagenham) 
Johnny McLoughlin, it involved calling for an &#8216;organised movement of the Marxist 
anti-Stalinist Left.&#8217; So that illusion is not only a lie, it is an insolent and 
elitist lie. And it stems from an ulterior intellectual contempt for the 
intelligence and moral sensibility of the working class.</p>

<p class="fst">Third, this lie is reflected in ormulu and gilt mirrors across 
the parlour. Socialist humanism (being, as we know, bourgeois) must of course be 
no more than a supine relapse into &#8216;bourgeois ideology&#8217; - humanism, moralism, 
u.s.w. This illusion is the more interesting, in a theoretical consideration, 
since it is the one commonly passed on intellectuals. Stalinism blocks all exits 
from its system by defining in advance any possible exit as &#8216;bourgeois.&#8217; And, 
alas, in this respect Trotskyism actually reinforced the Stalinist intellectual 
system, by rehearsing the same legends and setting up identical blocks. Thus, 
when I offered, in 1957, a critique of epistemological &#8216;reflection theory&#8217;, with 
reference to Lenin&#8217;s Materialism and Empirio-Criticism, Peter Fryer (a recent 
convert to Troskyism) declared that I was waging &#8216;an all-out assault on the 
philosophy of dialectical materialism&#8217;, and taking a road &#8216;which leads 
inevitably into the swamp of subjectivism and solipsism.&#8217;. . .<a href="#n138" name="fn138" target="_self">[138]</a> 
Althusser, in a condescending little foreword (&#8216;To my English Readers&#8217;) to <i>
For Marx</i>, patiently explains it thus:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The critique of Stalinist &#8216;dogmatism&#8217; was generally &#8216;lived&#8217; 
by Communist intellectuals as a &#8216;liberation&#8217;. This &#8220;liberation&#8221; gave birth to a 
profound ideological reaction, &#8216;liberal&#8217; and &#8216;ethical&#8217; in tendency, which 
spontaneously rediscovered the old philosophical themes of &#8216;freedom&#8217;, &#8216;man&#8217;, the 
&#8220;human person&#8221; and &#8216;alienation&#8217;. &quot; (F.Af. 10)</p>

<p class="fst">(It must be difficult to &#8216;speak&#8217; a theory like this, when at 
every second word, one must &#8216;contort&#8217; one&#8217;s features into a knowing &#8216;leer&#8217;, to 
&#8216;signify&#8217; to the reader that one &#8216;knows&#8217; <i>the true meaning</i> of these words 
behind their apparent &#8216;meaning&#8217;.) In 1972 he had become more blunt; he had only 
one recourse to inverted commas; &#8216;after the Twentieth Congress an openly 
rightist wave carried off (to speak only of them) many Marxist and Communist 
&#8220;intellectuals&#8217;, not only in the capitalist countries, but also in the socialist 
countries.&#8217; (<i>Essays</i>, 83)<a href="#n139" name="fn139" target="_self">[139]</a></p>

<p class="fst">So that is what we all were - &#8216;an openly rightist wave&#8217;. Almost 
alone, Althusser confronted the danger. He wrote <i>For Marx</i> &#8216;to combat the 
contagion which was &#8220;menacing&#8221; us.&#8217; It is strange that this &#8216;rightist wave&#8217;, 
this &#8216;contagion&#8217;, although it swept in men and women of all occupations and 
ages, should have swept most strongly through the generation of the anti-fascist 
struggle and the Resistance, through the generation most possessed still by the 
illusions of voluntarism (that they were &#8216;makers of history&#8217;), the generation 
which Althusser appears to have missed.</p>

<p class="fst">This, then, is the missing protagonist with whom Althusser 
wrestles in <i>For Marx</i> and <i>Reading Capital:</i> the anti-Stalinist 
revolt, the total intellectual critique, which converged for a time under the 
motto: &#8216;socialist humanism.&#8217; Please don&#8217;t misunderstand me: I am not offering 
&#8216;socialist humanism&#8217; as an alternative orthodoxy, nor as an adequate definition 
of all that this critique entailed, nor yet as a motto endorsed on every side. 
The term has had its own ambiguous history and I am not so tender at the passing 
of time as to wish to preserve it in theoretical amber. But his, if anywhere, is 
where all these critiques and actions converged.</p>

<p class="fst">This is the object of Althusser&#8217;s police action, the unnamed 
ghost at whom his arguments are directed. But the ghost is allowed no lines of 
his own. The reader of the &#8216;post-Stalinist generation&#8217; is encouraged to suppose 
him to be some timid intellectual, remote from any political action, &#8216;shocked&#8217; 
in his bourgeois moral sensibility, putting on his glasses, peering at Marx&#8217;s 
1844 manuscripts, and collapsing back into a &#8216;rightist&#8217; Feuerbachian 
complacency. This also is a direct lie. The actual themes of the critique: the 
structure and organisation of the Party: the control of the membership by the 
full-time apparatus: the Moscow orientation (and training) of that apparatus: 
the self-perpetuating modes of control (&#8216;democratic centralism&#8217;, the &#8216;panel&#8217; 
system, the outlawing of &#8216;factions&#8217;) - and from thence to the wider political 
and intellectual themes: none of these themes appear.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course, if one defines oneself as being in the middle of a 
sea, then any other waves <i>must</i> be on the &#8216;right&#8217; or on the &#8216;left&#8217;. The 
other waves will see it differently. From my own position, I cannot conceive of 
any wave in the working-class movement being further to the &#8216;right' than 
Stalinism. From any consideration of working-class self-activity, of socialist 
liberty, how is it possible to be further to the &#8216;right&#8217; than the 
anti-historicism and anti-humanism of Althusser?</p>

<p class="fst">But there is a final, an ultimate, illusion still to be 
performed. &#8216;Socialist humanism&#8217; may be the ghost with which Althusser was 
arguing. But, it turns out, this was only the <i>alias</i> for an even greater 
ghost, the unnamed ogre whose shadow falls across his lines. In 1972 this ogre 
is finally named: socialist humanism is the mask of Joseph Stalin! Not Stalin 
himself, please be clear: for behind the mask, Stalin&#8217;s visage is unclouded, 
proletarian, and theoretically unblemished: his thought &#8216;continues to hold 
itself comfortably above the uproar, in its bases, its &#8220;line&#8221; and certain of its 
practices&#8217; (<i>Essays</i>, 83). But in certain <i>other</i> of its practices we 
may detect the &#8216;Stalinian deviation&#8217;, and this is the twin, &#8216;economism/humanism&#8217; 
which must always be taken as &#8216;an ideological pair.' Stalin&#8217;s &#8216;economism&#8217; was 
&#8216;hidden by declarations which were, in their own way, cruelly &#8220;humanist&#8217;.&#8217; (<i>Essays,</i> 
85, 91) We are to suppose that &#8216;deviation&#8217; arose from a certain 
absent-mindedness, a relapse into the rhetoric of bourgeois ideology. 
Excessively preoccupied with building a productive &#8216;base&#8217; (&#8216;economism&#8217;) he 
slipped into exalted reveries about the &#8216;New Soviet Man&#8217;, and did not notice 
what was happening to &#8216;productive relations&#8217; (i.e. men and women) in between. 
Hence &#8216;socialist humanism&#8217; - an &#8216;imaginary treatment of real problems&#8217; is only a 
new projection of the &#8216;Stalinian deviation.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">And now a contortionist is brought on to illustrate the trick. A 
certain Grahame Lock, who has felt himself called upon to introduce the latest 
writings of Althusser and Balibar to a British public, takes up the centre of 
the parlour and glosses the texts. Economism is &#8216;to forget about class struggle, 
and to forget about class struggle is <i>humanism</i>.&#8217; Stalin was forgetful in 
this way, and &#8216;fell into both economism and humanism.&#8217; Hence he fell (just as we 
were to do in 1956) into certain traps prepared by the cunning of the 
bourgeoisie. The <i>gulags,</i> faked trials, and all that &#8216;were <i>bourgeois 
methods</i> used against the bourgeoisie, and they backfired disastrously.&#8217;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The trials and purges played a role <i>determined in the last 
instance by the class struggle inside the USSR,</i> even if in practice their 
victims were the &#8216;wrong ones&#8217;.&quot; (<i>Essays,</i> 14-15)</p>

<p class="fst">We will leave Mr Lock there, wriggling on the floor, one foot 
behind his neck, the other in his mouth. We have only introduced him for the 
purposes of light relief.</p>

<p class="fst">This whole section has been awful. Theory is so much clearer than 
history. I have written it only out of compassion for the innocence of a 
&#8216;post-Stalinist generation.&#8217; One day or the other they would have to be told. I 
have tried to unravel a tangled skein, to explain the function of 
Althusserianism as an ideological police action <i>against</i> any fundamental 
socialist critique of Stalinism, but a police action which presents itself 
(through a series of distorting mirrors) as exactly such a critique. I hope that 
I may have dispelled these illusions in two or three minds.</p>

<p class="fst">But even if doubtfully convinced, these minds will still propose 
further questions. As they should. They may ask: &#8216;Why do you drag us back into 
all this old stuff? The sins were committed long ago, in another country, and, 
anyway, the wench is dead, they have all been confessed. And Eurocommunism is a 
thoroughly reformed character. Why should we, of a post-Stalinist generation, be 
haunted by your memories?&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">My answer may be brief or extended. The brief answer is this. You 
are <i>not</i> a &#8216;post-Stalinist generation.&#8217; You are a generation amongst whom 
the reasons and legitimations of Stalinism are, by means of &#8216;theoretical 
practice&#8217;, being reproduced every day.</p>

<p class="fst">We may now extend this answer. The agenda presented to each 
generation is <i>always</i>, in good part, presented to it by the past. &#8216;My&#8217; 
socialist generation was not &#8216;responsible&#8217; for Fascism or for Stalinism. We 
found these already there when we came of age. We dealt with the first, and we 
neglected, for too long, the second. Hence it was transmitted, as perhaps the 
largest of all problems, to socialists today.</p>

<p class="fst">We must distinguish - as with all such phenomena - between 
Stalinism as a particular historical/political/sociological eventuation, and the 
ideology, institutions, and practices which arose within that particular moment 
of eventuation. Stalinism, in the first sense, certainly belongs to the past. It 
was not cunningly planned, nor - as Althusser and Lock appear to suppose - was 
it the outcome of some &#8216;deviation&#8217; <i>in theory</i>, some momentary lapse in 
Stalin&#8217;s theoretical rigour. It was the product of baffled human agency, within 
a desperate succession of contingencies, and subject to the severe 
determinations of Soviet history. This very difficult examination must be 
pursued in its own right. At a certain point, Stalinism may be seen as a 
systematic social formation, with a consonant ideological logic and legitimation 
- Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus from his historical matrix there emerged Stalinism, in a 
second sense. Stalinism was not just certain &#8216;errors&#8217; or unsatisfactory 
practices, which, after some twenty years, even Althusser is able to call 
&#8216;crimes.&#8217; We are not only (please remember) just talking about some millions of 
people (and most of these the &#8216;wrong&#8217; people) being killed or <i>gulaged.</i> We 
are talking about the deliberate manipulation of the law, the means of 
communication, the police and propaganda organs of a state, to blockade 
knowledge, to disseminate lies, to slander individuals; about institutional 
procedures which confiscated from the Soviet people all self-activating means 
(whether in democratic modes or in forms of workers&#8217; control), which substituted 
the Party for the working class, the Party&#8217;s leaders (or leader) for the Party, 
and the security organs for all; about the confiscation and centralisation of 
all intellectual and moral expression, into an ideological state orthodoxy - 
that is, not only the suppression of the democratic and cultural freedoms of 
&#8216;individuals&#8217;: this even Euro-Communism has come to regret (and we are glad that 
this is so) although, even in the moment of regretting, it is sometimes implied 
that these freedoms of individual dissent are &#8216;extras&#8217;, additions to the menu of 
socialist construction, which, after sixty years, the Soviet State should be 
able to afford: it is not only this, but within the confiscation of individual 
&#8216;rights&#8217; to knowledge and expression, we have the ulterior confiscation of the 
processes of communication and knowledge-formation of a whole people, without 
which neither Soviet workers nor collective farmers can know what is true nor 
what each other thinks.</p>

<p class="fst">From this historical matrix, then, there emerged Stalinism as a 
set of institutions and practices. And along with these there emerged the 
apologia, the theoretical legitimation of the practice. Spreading outwards from 
the Soviet Union, through the Comintern, this permeated the entire international 
Communist movement. The practices and the ideology were replicated, and the 
agents of this replication (the inner and trusted bureaucracies of national 
Communist parties) became, by a very exact analogy, the priesthood of a 
universal Church, adept at theological apologetics and &#8216;humanistic&#8217; homiletics, 
directly and knowingly deceiving their own memberships, agile in casuistry, and 
reinforcing their control by distinctively Stalinist procedures and forms - 
&#8216;democratic centralism&#8217;, the suppression of faction and discussion, the 
exclusive control of the Party&#8217;s political, theoretical and (as far as possible) 
intellectual organs, the slander of critics and opponents, and the covert 
manipulation of fellow travellers and front organisations. It is not true that 
international Communism &#8216;did not know&#8217; about Stalinism, prior to the Twentieth 
Congress of the CPSU; it both knew a great deal, and endorsed it, and it did not <i>
wish</i> to know about the rest, and denounced this as slander; what it &#8216;did not 
know&#8217; was that it was now &#8216;correct to denounce as the crimes of <i>one man</i> 
what it had previously exalted and apologised for, in the language of Marxist 
theory.</p>

<p class="fst">It will be seen that I am - as <i>Novy Mir</i> and Althusser 
predicted of socialist humanism - falling back upon &#8216;the most violent bourgeois 
anti-Communism and Trotskyist anti-Stalinism.&#8217; But at least I am not hopping 
like a kangaroo. Every single point in the last two paragraphs is abundantly 
documented, and not only in the works of scholars who may conveniently be ruled 
out of court as &#8216;bourgeios hacks&#8217;, but by Soviet and socialist authors (Victor 
Serge, Deutscher, Lewin, Claudin, Medvedev). Some part of it I can confirm by 
direct experience. Members of a &#8216;post-Stalinist generation&#8217; who have agonised 
over Balibar and Lacan but who have not acquainted themselves with the 
elementary history of socialism in this century might postpone their theoretical 
practice until they have dried themselves behind the ears.</p>

<p class="fst">But, if I may speak for &#8216;my&#8217; generation, for the moment of total 
contestation <i>within</i> Stalinism - that is, between Stalinism and 
alternative Communist traditions and forms - which was most manifest in &#8216;1956&#8217;, 
then two important reservations must be entered. First, we never, for one 
moment, said or supposed that this was <i>all</i> that international Communism 
was, or is, or was doing in those decades. Communists can never be reduced to 
agents of a Stalinist conspiracy; they were doing a hundred other things, many 
were important and within an alternative, authentic socialist tradition, some 
were heroic, and some of them no-one else would do. This is one reason why the 
contestations <i>within</i> Communism have been so sharp. Second, in our 
contestation with Stalinism we never allowed to lapse, for one moment, our 
contestation with capitalism and with Western imperialism. Not only this, but we 
never relapsed into the dishonest attempt to divorce Stalinism from its 
historical genesis in emergency and contingency, emergencies and contingencies 
supplied in good part by the furious hostility of international capitalism at 
the emergence of <i>any</i> socialist society. We never supposed that Stalinism 
was to be attributed in its origin to this or that theoretical &#8216;error&#8217;, nor to 
the innate evil will of Marxism, nor that analysis was ended by clucking our 
tongues in moral disapproval. We always saw international capitalism as a 
coparcener in socialist degeneration.</p>

<p class="fst">But that it was a profound degeneration, in actuality, in 
thought, and in organisational forms, we had no doubt. To combat this 
degeneration was the agenda which &#8216;history&#8217; passed down to us. The generation of 
&#8216;1956&#8217; did not say that God had failed; we said that <i>we</i> had failed, and 
that we meant to clear that failure up. And so? Is not that moment still far in 
the past? And perhaps we <i>succeeded?</i> For many of that old Stalinist 
priesthood have died or been pensioned off. Contingencies and contexts have 
changed; in what we had supposed to be the corpse of international Communism, 
movement can be seen once again. It breathes and stirs its limbs. Perhaps the 
critique of&#8216;1956&#8217; was too precipitate, too passionate, too purist: but it was 
not altogether wrong? In mysterious ways, and through the basic instincts of the 
proletarian organism, Communism is proving capable of self-reform. 
Euro-Communism has left Stalinism long behind; it has passed resolutions against 
it; Althusser is pursuing a theoretical critique.</p>

<p class="fst">Some part of this is so. And that part is welcome. We have never 
supposed that Stalinism penetrated equally to all parts of the international 
movement. Nor have we ever proposed that Communism (in which &#8216;we&#8217; also invested 
so many of our thoughts and acts) was an insanitary area. There <i>is</i> 
movement There is even genuine self-questioning, real discussion, dialogue. It 
moves at different paces, here and there. With Italian Communism, which 
contained, in Gramsci, a moment of theoretical honour, it has moved in 
interesting ways. It has even moved in France. And M. Marchais, as we know, has 
promised that when he comes to power he will be kind to animals. My cat, who 
read this over my shoulder, laughed. But I did not laugh. I think that, in 
certain favourable contingencies, and, recalling, above all, the libertarian 
traditions of the French and Italian peoples, expressing themselves within the 
membership of these mass parties, and imposing their will upon the leaderships - 
given all this, the outcome of Communist participation in governments of the 
Left might be one which opened new and more democratic socialist possibilities. 
All this is possible, as historical eventuation.</p>

<p class="fst">But this does not mean that the project of &#8216;1956&#8217; has been 
fulfilled. For, even if we take the most generous view of these changes and the 
most optimistic view of future tendencies, this project can only be fulfilled on 
one condition: that the agenda of 1956 is carried through to the bitter end. Of 
course, Stalinism as historical eventuation belongs to the past; it will not 
come back in that form; the future will eventuate in other ways. And, of course, 
there are plenty of opportunistic reasons why Western Communist Parties wish 
that the smell of the past would go away. It is an electoral inconvenience that 
Solzhenitsyn should appear in the capitalist press every other day. No-one <i>
wanted gulags</i> to happen, and no-one - certainly not M. Marchais - wants them 
to happen in France. Stalinism belongs to the past. We are already moving on.</p>

<p class="fst">And yet, <i>does it</i> belong to the past? For it was, not only 
a particular historical eventuation, but also one of the ultimate disasters of 
the human mind and conscience, a terminus of the spirit, a disaster area in 
which every socialist profession of &#8216;good faith&#8217; was blasted and burned up. And 
if one was bred in <i>that</i> area, hopping about and proclaiming it to be 
utopia, does one get out of it by only a few more opportunist hops?</p>

<p class="fst">So let us stop playing the &#8216;generation game.&#8217; If we consider 
Stalinism in its second sense, as a set of institutional forms, practices, 
abstracted theories, and dominative attitudes, then the &#8216;post-Stalinist 
generation&#8217; has not yet been born. Stalinism, in this sense, gave to us the 
agenda of the present, and its forms and modes &#8216;weigh like an alp&#8217; on the brains 
of the living. And the living (never mind which generation) need their combined 
strength to shift that alp. If you have had an alp on your mind, you will know 
that it is not removed by a theoretical shrug of the shoulders (&#8216;economism&#8217;, 
&#8216;humanism&#8217;).</p>

<p class="fst">I do not only mean that the Soviet Union, the largest alp of ail, 
is governed by practices and legitimated by a State ideology (&#8216;Marxism&#8217;) which 
is directly derivative from Stalinism. (I may safely predict that, over the next 
twenty years, we will have sufficient lurid reminders of that; that the 
multiform self-assertions of the Soviet people will, more often than not, appear 
as a nausea with the Party and its ideology; and that M. Marchais will meet with 
repeated electoral disappointments.) I do not only mean that enigmatic China 
revives, year by year, more disturbing memories; that when the country&#8217;s most 
respected leaders and Marxist <i>clairvoyants</i> became overnight a &#8216;gang of 
four&#8217;, we do not understand what is happening but we do know that neither we nor 
the Chines people will be told, and we remember, uneasily, previous exposures 
of&#8216;traitors&#8217; at the peaks of power. Nor do I only mean that there are certain <i>
continuities</i> in the personnel, forms, procedures, vocabulary, strategies and 
methods of &#8216;reformed&#8217; Euro-Communist parties - continuities which may be 
modified by opportunist measures but which, very often, may not be subjected to 
a sustained and principled critique (unless by an &#8216;enemy of the Party&#8217;). I have 
asked my cat, and he has explained that it is all this which made him laugh. But 
there is still something more than all these. It has been, throughout, the 
subject of this essay.</p>

<p class="fst">Stalinism, in its second sense, and considered as theory, was not 
one &#8216;error&#8217;, nor even two &#8216;errors&#8217;, which may be identified, &#8216;corrected&#8217;, and 
Theory thus reformed. Stalinism was not absent-minded about crimes: it <i>bred</i> 
crimes. In the same moment that Stalinism emitted &#8216;humanist&#8217; rhetoric, it 
occluded the human faculties as part of its necessary mode of respiration. Its 
very breath stank (and still stinks) of inhumanity, because it has found a way 
of regarding people as the bearers of structures (<i>kulaks)</i> and history as 
a process without a subject. It is not an admirable theory, flawed by errors; it 
is a heresy against reason, which proposed that all knowledge can be summated in 
a single Theory, of which it is the sole arbitor and guardian. It is not an 
imperfect &#8216;science', but an ideology suborning the good name of science in order 
to deny all independent rights and authenticity to the moral and imaginative 
faculties. It is not only a compendium of errors, it is a cornucopia out of 
which new errors ceaselessly flow (&#8216;mistakes&#8217;, &#8216;incorrect lines&#8217;). Stalinism is 
a distinct, ideological mode of thought, a systematic theoretical organisation 
of &#8216;error&#8217; for the reproduction of more &#8216;error.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">All this I could see, even if unclearly, as the smoke was rising 
above Budapest. Thousands of others, in a thousand different places, could see 
the same. I itemised the &#8216;errors' of Stalinist theory, one by one: the 
&#8216;dictatorship of the proletariat&#8217; (in its Stalinist version): the &#8216;military 
vocabulary&#8217;: the theory of the Party -</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;And the mechanical theory of human consciousness is wrong: 
the theory that historical science &#8216;can become as precise a science as, let us 
say, biology&#8217;: the subordination of the imaginative and moral faculties to 
political and administrative authority is wrong . . . the fear of independent 
thought . . . the mechanical personification of unconscious class forces ... all 
this is wrong.&#8221;<a href="#n140" name="fn140" target="_self">[140]</a></p>

<p class="fst">And I identified also the reproductive organs of all this teeming 
&#8216;error&#8217;: &#8216;the Stalinist mode of thought is . . . that of mechanical idealism&#8217;, 
and &#8216;we must view Stalinism as an ideology ... a constellation of partisan 
attitudes and false, or partially false, ideas&#8217;, &#8216;establishing a <i>system</i> 
of false concepts within a mode of thought which ... in the Marxist sense ... is 
idealist.&#8217;<a href="#n141" name="fn141" target="_self">[141]</a> Finally, I 
identified Stalin&#8217;s own claim to pre-eminence as practitioner of this system. He 
was not only, as had recently been discovered on his birthday, the Greatest 
Marxist, Greatest Philosopher, Greatest Linguist, etc., but he was also the 
Greatest Kangaroo. For an idealist mode of this kind, must, of necessity, 
through its imperviousness to &#8216;empirical&#8217; discourse, repeatedly reproduce 
&#8216;mistakes&#8217; and &#8216;wrong results.&#8217; &#8216;The Stalinist oscillates between the axiom and <i>
realpolitik</i>, dogmatism and opportunism. When the axioms cease to produce 
results a &#8220;mistake&#8221; is recognised. But the cornucopia from which &#8220;mistakes&#8221; flow 
in such abundance is never recognised.&#8217;<a href="#n142" name="fn142" target="_self">[142]</a> <i>
Hop! -</i> (dialectical materialism) - <i>hop!</i> - (theoretical practice) - <i>
bump!</i> At the end of that high theoretical exercise: Khrushchev&#8217;s secret 
speech.</p>

<p class="fst">Yes, all of this thousands of us could see. But we could not, 
finally, identify the organisation of Stalin&#8217;s theoretical structure. This was 
not only owing to our own incompetence. It was also because that structure, in 
its pure theoretic beauty and conceptual coherence, had not yet been made. For 
Stalin was a mixture of Marxist theorist, pragmatist, and hypocrite. Some bits 
of the system he had time to attend to (the &#8216;superstructure is created by the 
basis precisely in order to serve it&#8217;) but it was full of rents and holes, which 
he patched up with humanist rhetoric, rule-of-thumb decisions, and security 
decrees. It is only in our own time that Stalinism has been given its true, 
rigorous and totally coherent theoretical expressions. This is the Althusserian 
orrery.</p>

<p class="fst">I do not wish to be ungenerous to a &#8216;post-Stalinist generation&#8217;, 
but it is necessary to be plain. Theoretical practitioners are familiar with a 
central concept of Marx: that a given productive system not only produces 
commodities, it also reproduces itself, its productive relations and its 
ideological forms and legitimations. These, in their turn, become a necessary 
condition for the process of reproduction. Stalinism as ideology has continued 
to reproduce itself long after the particular historical moment of high 
Stalinism has passed. And so long as it does so in theory, it will tend to 
reproduce itself in fact - not in exactly the same form, of course, but in a 
form sufficiently uncomfortable for its human objects, and even for some of the 
intellectuals who serve as its priests. So far from being a &#8216;post-Stalinist 
generation&#8217;, the Althusserians, and those who share their premises and idealist 
modes, are working hard, every day, on the theoretical production-line of 
Stalinist ideology. In terms of theory, they are the Stalinists. They are the 
carriers of those &#8216;reasons&#8217; of irrationality and inhumanity against which we 
drew up the agenda of 1956 . . .</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;But this is passion over-near ourselves,<br>
Reality too close and too intense,<br>
And mingled up with something, in my mind,<br>
Of scom and condemnation personal...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">And the patient, &#8216;post-Stalinist&#8217; reader, who has followed me 
this far, will still have other questions on his mind: &#8216;Well? And did you 
people, with your &#8220;agenda&#8217;, correctly identify the theoretical sources of 
Stalinism? What came of it all? Did you construct a better Theory?&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">I will answer these questions. And conclude.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h14">xiv</a></h3>

<p class="fst">First, let us return from the vulgar sociology of ideas to theory 
and its pure discourse of the truth. Let us revisit the orrery for a last time. 
Let us not only admire its parts but also notice the parts with which it is <i>
not</i> supplied.</p>

<p class="fst">Althusser&#8217;s eviction of &#8216;humanism&#8217; and &#8216;moralising in <i>For 
Marx,</i> was somewhat brutal. So he returned to the theme, with renewed 
sophistication, in <i>Reading Capital</i> The &#8216;real&#8217; world, the gross 
manifestations of the &#8216;obvious&#8217;, the unpurified concepts of Generalities I, 
these epiphenomena would lead us (unless guided by Theory) into a world of <i>
maya,</i> illusion. The text of history (we remember) is &#8216;the inaudible and 
illegible notation of the effects of a structure of structures.&#8217; (<i>R.C.</i> 
17) Beneath all, we will find <i>La Structure a Dominante.</i> The theory of <i>
Capital</i> is &#8216;the theory of a mode of production.&#8217; And &#8216;what Marx studies in <i>
Capital</i> is the mechanism which makes the result of a history&#8217;s production 
exist <i>as a society</i>hence &#8216;producing the <i>&#8220;society effect'</i> which 
makes this result exist <i>as a society</i> . . . &#8216; (<i>R.S.</i> 65):</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We are beginning to suspect, even if it is only because of 
the works of contemporary ethnology and history, that this <i>society effect</i> 
differs with different modes of production.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Moreover, this society effect is made up of other, lesser 
effects: &#8216;the knowledge effect for theoretical practice, the aesthetic effect 
for aesthetic practice, the ethical effect for ethical practice, etc.&#8217; &#8216;The 
search for each of these specific &#8220;effects&#8221; demands the elucidation of the <i>
mechanism</i> that produces it . . .&#8217; (<i>R.C.</i> 66) This &#8216;mechanism&#8217; will be 
found within the structure oaf the mode of production. On two occasions, on 
these two crucial pages, Althusser proudly flourishes what he supposes to be his 
licence of authority &#8212; that sentence from <i>The Poverty of Philosophy</i> which 
we have found out to be in fact a court order to put his dog down.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus society, social formations, are <i>effects</i> of the 
structure of a mode of production. <i>Capital</i> also enables us to understand 
the particles of which this structure is composed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It defines for the capitalist mode of production the 
different forms of individuality required and produced by that mode according to 
functions, of which the individuals are &#8216;supports&#8217; (<i>Trager</i>), in the 
division of labour, in the different &#8216;levels&#8217; of the structure. Of course, even 
here, the mode of historical existence of individuality in a given mode of 
production is not legible to the naked eye in &#8216;history&#8217;; its concept, too, must 
therefore be <i>constructed,</i> and like every concept it contains a number of 
surprises, the most striking of which is the fact that it is nothing like the 
false obviousness of the &#8216;given&#8217; - which is merely the mask of current 
ideology.&#8217; &quot; (<i>R.C.</i> 112)</p>

<p class="fst">Even if we allow ourselves to suppose, for a moment, that we are 
offered here an astounding insight, which de-mystifies &#8216;the false obviousness of 
the &#8220;given&#8221; and takes us directly to essential truths illegible to the &#8216;naked 
eye in &#8220;history&#8221;, it is difficult to know how our devastating insight can be, as 
it were, &#8216;spoken.&#8217; Let us suppose that&gt; at a certain conjuncture, there is a 
moment within the society effect which &#8216;gives&#8217; itself to &#8216;history&#8217;s&#8217; naked eye 
with the false obviousness of a shop steward saying to his fellow-workers: &#8216;Hey, 
lads! The production manager is coming to the canteen today to give us a pep 
talk on measured day work. Let&#8217;s give him a hot reception!&#8217; In order to 
de-mystify these sentences, and <i>construct</i> them, within theory, as 
rigorous concepts, we must verbalise them thus: &#8216;O <i>trager</i> of proletarian 
productive relations! The <i>trager</i> alloted a dominant function within 
bourgeois productive relations will manifest itself in the &#8216;canteen&#8217; at this 
overdetermined conjuncture through the mechanism of a relatively autonomous 
ethical effect determined in the last instance by the law of motion of 
capitalist production relations at the level of the intensified extraction of 
surplus-value from the labour-power of the proletarian trager. It is determined 
that this conjuncture shall manifest itself in the form of a &#8220;hot&#8221; 
contradiction!&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">It will be seen that we have successfully reduced the 
shop-steward&#8217;s ideology to science, with the exception of two words. &#8216;Canteen&#8217; 
is irredeemably polluted with the obviousness of Tact&#8217;, and &#8216;hot&#8217; is an 
irreducibly moralistic invasion, so that these words must be contained within 
inverted commas lest they should contaminate the adjacent scientificity of the 
text. It will also be seen that de-mystification has necessitated the use of 84 
words in place of 27. This is, very generally, the case. But it is a small 
inconvenience to accompany the attainment of revolutionary rigour. No doubt at 
all, de-mystification of such devastating clarify, if practised within the heart 
of the productive structures as a political praxis (philosophy as class 
struggle) will detonate the whole capitalist order. I cannot understand why the 
Althusserians are waiting. Why don&#8217;t they hurry down to Dagenham or Longbridge 
and try?</p>

<p class="fst">But no reports of such praxis have yet come back to me. And for 
this there must be some theoretical reason. And an even more rigorous 
post-Althusserian - let us say, a Hindessian-Hirstian - will detect this by a 
scrupulous symptomatic reading of Althusser&#8217;s decidedly-not-innocent &#8216;text&#8217;. 
For, under this scrutiny, the shop steward - and indeed the whole sentence - can 
be exposed as a pseudo-problem, as an abjectly ideological intrusion. This is 
given away in the very first word, the vocative, &#8216;O&#8217;. For this is to smuggle 
back into theory both historicism and moralism, by allowing us to suppose that 
the workers are subjects, that they can &#8216;intervene&#8217; as &#8216;men&#8217; in &#8216;history&#8217;. But 
the situation alluded to in these sentences is in fact a society effect of 
contradiction within the mode of production. This effect is already inscribed 
within productive relations and requires no imaginary interpellation of 
vocatives and subjects. We may relax in our chairs. We may even doze, since 
contradiction will continue to manifest its effects as shop stewards. There is 
no need to go down to Dagenham after all.</p>

<p class="fst">This has been a vulgar, even empiricist, response. Let us resume 
our exposition. Humanism, Althusser argues, is the heresy which introduces &#8216;men&#8217; 
as agents or subjects in their own history by an &#8216;underhand reduction&#8217;, by 
treating the <i>relations of production as mere human relations</i> (<i>R.C.</i> 
139)</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;History then becomes the transformation of a human nature, 
which remains the real subject of the history which transforms it. As a result, 
history has been introduced into human nature, making men the contemporaries of 
the historical effects whose subjects they are, but - and this is absolutely 
decisive - the relations of production, political and ideological social 
relations, have been reduced to historicized <i>&#8216;human relations&#8217;,</i> i.e. to 
inter-human, inter-subjective relations. This is the favourite terrain of 
historicist humanism.&quot; (<i>R.C.</i> 140)</p>

<p class="fst">Althusser entertains for anthropology a malice even fiercer than 
that which he entertains for &#8216;history'<a href="#n143" name="fn143" target="_self">[143]</a> 
The notion of man making his own nature is one which &#8216;a horde of cultural 
anthropologists have adopted.&#8217; (<i>R.C.</i> 140) Even Marx is convicted of 
relapsing from time to time into a &#8216;latent anthropology&#8217;, a &#8216;&#8220;naive&#8221; 
anthropology&#8217; given in the hidden assumptions of Political Economy. Balibar is 
honest enough to allow that, again and again, Marx and Engels afford support for 
&#8216;the idea that <i>it is men who make history on the basis of previous conditions</i>/ 
&#8216;But who are these &#8220;men&#8217;?&#8217; &#8216;The concept of &#8220;men&#8221; . . . constitutes a real point 
where the utterance <i>slips azvay</i> towards the regions of philosophical or 
commonplace ideology.&#8217; &#8216;The &#8220;obviousness&#8221;, the &#8220;transparency&#8221; of the word &#8220;men&#8221; 
(here charged with every carnal opacity) and its anodyne appearance are the most 
dangerous of the traps I am trying to avoid. I shall not be satisfied until I 
have . . . <i>eliminated</i> it as a foreign body . . (<i>R.C.</i> 207-8)</p>

<p class="fst">One trouble with this mode of theoretical practice is that an 
untutored and protestant mind keeps &#8216;slipping away&#8217; into wholly irrelevant 
reflections. For example, at &#8216;carnal opacity&#8217; I fall into a reverie, and wonder 
whether M. Balibar also came to intellectual maturation within the Jeunes 
Etudiants Catholiques? And then, by random association, I recall that Stalin 
served his own intellectual apprenticeship in a seminary of the Greek Orthodox 
priesthood .. . And then, since I am a fussy stylist, I wonder whether &#8216;<i>eliminated</i> 
as a foreign body&#8217; might not be improved, when we consider the &#8216;anodyne&#8217; concept 
of &#8216;men&#8217;, by the verb, &#8216;to <i>liquidated</i> For, if we think about persons in a 
certain way, it becomes more easy to enact our thoughts. If we think about women 
as &#8216;dolls' or &#8216;pieces&#8217; or &#8216;chicks&#8217; or whatever, it may be more easy to behave to 
them in this way. (Some women may even think themselves so.) If we think about 
men as the <i>trdger</i> of structures - or of their actions as &#8216;unjustified 
disturbance systems&#8217; - then the thought will guide the act As those lofty 
theoretical practitioners, the <i>daleks</i>, used to say, when confronted by 
&#8216;men&#8217;: &#8216;<i>Exterminate!</i>&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">This reminds me once again of anthropology. For Althusser became 
involved, for a moment, in chapter seven of Reading Capital, in an interesting 
argument. He stood back and confronted (as I have earlier done (p. 80)) 
Political Economy as an object, as a structure. And he found, as I think 
correctly, that Political Economy is based upon a prior definition and 
delimitation of a given field of activities. But to generalise from these 
activities, and to assert claims for itself as a universal or fundamental 
science of society, there must be, within Political Economy, an ulterior 
assumption; and this can be located in the concept of &#8216;need&#8217;. For &#8216;need&#8217; is what 
I have called a &#8216;junction-concept&#8217;, in this case between economics and 
anthropology. (It will be seen that I am not following Althusser&#8217;s words, but 
clarifying them and putting them into some order.) He then discovers that 
classical economics is founded on the presupposition of &#8216;a &#8220;naive&#8221; anthropology 
which founds all the acts involved in the production, distribution, reception 
and consumption of economic objects on the economic subjects and their needs.&#8217; 
(R.C. 162) Thus &#8216;need&#8217; is defined in such a way (self-interest) that its 
conclusions are entailed in its premises. All basic human needs are <i>economic</i> 
ones, as defined by Political Economy; therefore Political Economy is the basic 
science of society.</p>

<p class="fst">What then would seem to follow? It might seem that Marx, in 
shattering bourgeois Political Economy, would liberate anthropology - or at 
least provide a precondition for its liberation, in freeing &#8216;need&#8217; from 
definitions imposed by bourgeois and utilitarian convenience, and permitting 
anthropology to investigate &#8216;need&#8217;s&#8217; larger resonance. But not at all! As we 
enter chapter eight, we find that the &#8216;theoretical pretensions&#8217;, not of 
bourgeois Political Economy, but of <i>anthropology</i> &#8216;have been shattered by 
Marx&#8217;s analysis.&#8217; (<i>R.C.</i> 166) Marx is now offered to us as a <i>dalek</i>, 
rushing down upon anthropology, and crying out:</p>

<p class="fst">&#8216;<i>Exterminate!&#8217;</i> But if we exterminate the very 
presupposition upon which Political Economy is founded - if we take away from 
economics its support in &#8216;need&#8217; - then it would seem to rest on a vacancy. Did 
Marx find a better concept of need, a better anthropological basis? Not at all: 
&#8216;an anthropological basis becomes therefore purely mythical.&#8217; (<i>R.C.</i> 167) 
Needs are not economic, they are <i>defined by</i> the economic, they are 
&#8216;subject to a double <i>structural . .</i> , determination.&#8217; Needs are <i>
assigned</i> their content and meaning by &#8216;the structure of the relations 
between the productive forces and the relations of production.&#8217; (<i>R.C.</i> 
167) They are not only assigned their content, but also their meaning <i>as 
economic.</i> For to be <i>economic</i> is not to be &#8216;economic&#8217; in a vulgar, 
&#8216;common-scnse&#8217; way of being concerned with &#8216;economic&#8217; needs. It means occupying 
a certain space, a certain function, to which <i>La Structure a Dominante 
assigns</i> a meaning, according to the modulation and flux of her mode of 
production. &#8216;To construct the concept of the economic is to define it rigorously 
as a level, instance or region of the structure of a mode of production.&#8217; (<i>R.C.</i> 
178)</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The economic cannot have the qualities of a <i>given</i> (of 
the immediately visible and observable, etc.) because its identification 
requires the concept of the structure of the mode of production . . . because 
its identification therefore presupposes the construction of its <i>concept.</i> 
The concept of the economic must be constructed <i>for each mode of production</i> 
. . .&quot; (<i>R.C.</i> 183)</p>

<p class="fst">This manoeuvre solves (or should we say dissolves?) a number of 
difficult problems which have bothered historians and anthropologists for 
decades into a single wet theoretical pabulum. Kinship in primitive societies is 
the &#8216;level, instance or region&#8217; to which the structure has assigned the 
&#8216;economic&#8217;; military and political dominance is the economic &#8216;instance&#8217; in 
feudal society. And so on. &#8216;Need&#8217; in one case may appear as the need for seven 
wives and in another case as the need to behead a traitor to his oath of fealty, 
but both are &#8216;economic', and we certainly have no need of any anthropology to 
decipher either. Moreover, what could be more abject than the ideological 
illusion that men and women might participate subjectively, at any &#8216;level&#8217; 
whatsoever, in the definition of need? For they are <i>trager</i> - supports of 
structures within which needs are assigned.</p>

<p class="fst">I am becoming tired, and my mind has slipped off once again. For 
all that Althusser has done, in exterminating anthropology, is to throw &#8216;need&#8217; 
back upon the bosom of <i>La Structure a Dominante,</i> so that not one part or 
&#8216;region&#8217; of her &#8216;totality&#8217; but her whole person is subjected to the gross 
utilitarian embraces of the &#8216;economic.&#8217; And I recall a critique of the 
utilitarian concept of &#8216;need&#8217;, presented at the annunciation of the capitalist 
mentality, in the words of one great proto-Marxist, King Lear:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;O, reason not the need: our basest beggars Are in the poorest 
things superfluous:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Allow not nature more than nature needs,<br>
Man&#8217;s life is cheap as beast&#8217;s...<br>
But for true need - You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Patience is, very certainly, our first &#8216;need&#8217; if we are to reason 
with Althusser.</p>

<p class="fst">I will be patient, but for a last time. I will look once more at 
the concept of <i>trager</i>, I will argue it through, and then this scrutiny of 
the orrery is done. The fullest statement is thus:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The structure of the relations of production determines the <i>
places</i> and <i>functions</i> occupied and adopted by the agents of 
production, who are never anything more than the occupants of these places, 
insofar as they are the &#8220;supports&#8221; (<i>Trager)</i> of these functions. The true 
&#8216;subjects&#8217; (in the sense of constitutive subjects of the process) are therefore 
not these occupants or functionaries, are not, despite all appearances, the 
&#8216;obviousness&#8217; of the &#8216;given&#8217; of naive anthropology, &#8216;concrete individuals&#8217;, 
&#8216;real men&#8217; - but <i>the definition and distribution of these places and 
functions. The true</i> &#8220;<i>subjects</i>&#8221; <i>are these definers and 
distributors: the relations of production</i> (and political and ideological 
relations). But since these are &#8220;relations&#8217;, they cannot be thought within the 
category <i>subject.&quot;</i>  (.<i>R.C.</i> 180)</p>

<p class="fst">The errors with which this argument is littered are so elementary 
that we need only indicate them one by one. First, there is the confusion of the 
notion of structure with structuralism. Structures (social, economic, 
conceptual) are not a discovery of the last two decades, with a lonely 
forerunner in Karl Marx. As soon as we talk about &#8216;organisation' (or 
&#8216;organism&#8217;), about &#8216;system&#8217;, about the &#8216;laws&#8217; of supply and demand, or about 
&#8216;institutions&#8217; (and about &#8216;functionaries&#8217;), we are talking about structure: and 
we are likely also to be talking about the ways in which human behaviour is 
ruled, shaped, ordered, limited and determined. This notion, and the theoretical 
and empirical exploration of these structures, have been with us for many 
generations. So far from being a revolutionary notion, it has been quite often - 
when pursued by practitioners to the ultimate of theoretical &#8216;rigour&#8217; - a 
profoundly conservative one, since it tends to see men and women as fixed in 
&#8216;stations&#8217;, on ladders of &#8216;rank&#8217;, subject to &#8216;laws&#8217; (of Smith or of Malthus), 
allocated &#8216;roles&#8217;, or as moments of conformity or deviance within an ulterior 
consensus.</p>

<p class="fst">This is in no sense to argue that the notion is untrue or 
reactionary in itself, although when pushed illegitimately from structure to 
structuralism it always is both. It is simply a reminder that Althusser here, as 
elsewhere, is simply reproducing in &#8216;Marxist&#8217; terminology notions long 
sanctified within orthodox (&#8216;bourgeois&#8217;) disciplines. Although some of his 
followers do not yet seem to have found this out,<a href="#n144" name="fn144" target="_self">[144]</a> 
the notion of men as <i>trager</i>) or carriers of functions allocated to them 
by the market - &#8216;laws&#8217; or supply and demand which were even moralised as 
&#8216;divine&#8217; - was at the very heart of vulgarised bourgeois Political Economy. 
During Marx&#8217;s lifetime this ideology sought exactly to <i>impose</i> this 
structure upon the working class, and, at the same time, to convince them that 
they were powerless to resist these &#8216;immutable&#8217; laws; and much of the history of 
the British working class, in these decades, can only be understood as a heroic 
(even &#8216;moralistic&#8217;) <i>refusal</i> to be reduced to being supports of the 
reasons and necessities of capital. When Marx refers, at one point, to the 
labourer as &quot;the bearer of living labour&quot; it is in the context of exactly such a 
discussion of the alienation of &#8216;the productive powers of social labour&#8217; as the 
property of a stranger, and as subject to the (anti-humanist) requirements of 
capitalist production: &#8216;It is entirely different in the factories owned by the 
labourers themselves, for instance, in Rochdale/<a href="#n145" name="fn145" target="_self">[145]</a> 
When Marx, in his well-known comment in the first Preface to <i>Capital</i>, 
disclaimed making any judgement on individual capitalists, it was because from 
&#8216;my <i>stand-point</i>, from which the <i>economic formation</i> of society <i>
is viewed</i> as a process of natural history&#8217; individuals could be seen, not as 
malevolent and responsible agents, but as &#8216;the personifications of economic 
categories, embodiments of particular class-relations and class-interests.&#8217; But 
this was to view persons as they appear &#8216;<i>in the domain of Political Economy</i>&#8217;:<a href="#n146" name="fn146" target="_self">[146]</a> 
i.e. as they were continually being &#8216;<i>viewed</i>&#8217; within orthodox apologetics 
of the age. So that Marx was writing, with his tongue firmly in his cheek, and 
striking a pre-emptive blow against his critics by borrowing the rhetoric 
closest to the hearts of every exploiter who could exonerate himself as being 
the <i>trager</i> of economic &#8216;laws&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus, as always with Althusser, we are offered an ideological 
penny, greasy with bourgeois use, and told it is Marxist gold. That penny&#8217;s twin 
is still being passed every day in Parsonian and structuralist-functional 
systems: behind Althusser&#8217;s &#8216;<i>definition and distribution of . .</i> . <i>
places and functions&#8217;</i>, with all its italicised &#8216;rigour&#8217;, we find the 
Smelserian &#8216;social system&#8217;,<a href="#n147" name="fn147" target="_self">[147]</a> 
behind <i>trager</i> we find &#8216;roles&#8217;, and behind Althusser&#8217;s grotesque notion of 
ideological &#8216;interpellation&#8217; or &#8216;hailing&#8217; we find even more <i>chic</i> notions 
of men and women (<i>except</i>, of course, select intellectuals) not thinking 
or acting, but being <i>thought</i> and being <i>performed.</i><a href="#n148" name="fn148" target="_self">[148]</a> 
All these exalted thinkers, &#8216;bourgeois&#8217; or &#8216;Marxist&#8217;, proceed from the same 
&#8216;latent anthropology&#8217;, the same ulterior assumption about &#8216;Man&#8217; - that all men 
and women (except themselves) are bloody silly.</p>

<p class="fst">Second, there are two trivial and furtive sleights of hand in 
Althusser&#8217;s argument which could only deceive an audience hand-picked from the <i>
lumpen-intelligentsia.</i><a href="#n149" name="fn149" target="_self">[149]</a> 
a) Althusser tried to take out another licence of authority by gesturing at 
Marx&#8217;s theoretical rupture with Feuerbachian &#8216;Man&#8217;, the &#8216;human essence.&#8217; Of 
course, as any first-year student finds out, in rejecting abstracted and generic 
&#8216;Man&#8217;, Marx rediscovered men and women, within &#8216;the ensemble of social 
relations&#8217;, within societies structured in class ways, and within &#8216;empirically 
observable&#8217; conditions.<a href="#n150" name="fn150" target="_self">[150]</a> As 
a matter of fact, it is a question, and a very difficult one, how far Marx and 
Engels ever did fully reject the concept, &#8216;man&#8217;, which reappears in the concept 
of alienation, in the notion of a &#8216;truly human morality&#8217;, and in what some 
scholars detect as an historical teleology of human immanence. I mention this 
question, which I cannot turn aside for now and which has been exhaustively 
discussed by others, only to note that Althusser blocks and dismisses (as 
lapses, immaturities surviving after the &#8216;epistemological break&#8217;) theoretical 
problems manifestly present in Marx&#8217;s writing, which other critics have found to 
be either fertile or severely disabling.<a href="#n151" name="fn151" target="_self">[151]</a> 
My immediate concern is only to notice that Marx and Engels, in their major 
investigations, dislodged the concept, &#8216;man&#8217;, in order to return to 
empirically-observable <i>real men</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">b) The other sleight of hand is the same trick performed 
backwards. &#8216;Humanists&#8217; - and all &#8216;anthropologists&#8217; - return to the concept, 
&#8216;man&#8217;, &#8216;by treating the <i>relations of production</i> as mere <i>human 
relations</i>&#8217;, i.e. reducing these to &#8216;historicized&#8217; relations, &#8216;to 
inter-human, inter-subjective relations.&#8217; This trick could only be passed upon 
an audience innocent of all knowledge of both history and anthropology, and it 
is disturbing that a &#8216;practice&#8217; of this kind could attain to academic 
reputability, I am by no means endorsing all sociology, all historiography, nor 
all that has been produced by the &#8216;horde of cultural anthropologists.&#8217; In fact, 
some practitioners within these disciplines are reducing men and women to <i>
trager</i> of structures as happily as Althusser. But scarcely a soul among them 
will be found to be commencing with the proposition of a &#8216;human essence' nor 
making their object of study &#8216;individual men&#8217;, in 'inter-subjective relations&#8217;, 
as against &#8216;society.&#8217; Their objects of study may include kinship systems, 
inheritance practices, demographic norms, value-systems, social structures, 
political institutions, class relations, ideological forms, symbolic modes, 
consensual rules. The &#8216;social sciences&#8217; today are the products of a 
methodological revolution, one of whose initiators was Marx. It is precisely 
their structural preoccupations which place their feet upon the <i>glissade</i> 
which leads to structuralism, and which prepare their novices for Althusser's 
embrace.</p>

<p class="fst">The third elementary error is to confuse the findings of 
particular analytical disciplines with the &#8216;truth&#8217; about the total phenomenon 
from which the procedures of that discipline have selected only relevant 
evidences. I have argued this already, and with particular reference to 
Political Economy (pp. 80-81); this discipline defines its own field of enquiry, 
and selects its evidence in accordance with these definitions, and its findings 
are relevant within the terms of this discipline. Everyone knows this; we do not 
turn to Ricardo for an explanation of Socinianism. In a certain kinship system, 
a wife&#8217;s brother's second cousin may be understood (within the discipline of 
anthropology) as a certain point within a structured set of relations, and this 
as (metaphorically) a &#8216;bearer&#8217; (<i>trager</i>) of those relations; and in 
exactly the same way, a capitalist may be &#8216;viewed&#8217; as a &#8216;bearer&#8217; of capitalist 
productive relations.<a href="#n152" name="fn152" target="_self">[152]</a> The 
discipline has already decided that we define this person so. That this second 
cousin or this capitalist may be defined quite differently within other 
disciplines, may be viewed (by a wife or by his own workers) in quite different 
lights, does not - or <i>need</i> not - invalidate the findings in question.</p>

<p class="fst">Theoretical practitioners are often to be observed, in small 
intense groups, interrogating categories. But, because of their empirical 
blockages, they are incapable of interrogating the point (in society or history) 
where these categories intersect. Instead of interrogating a category, we will 
interrogate a woman. It will at least be more agreeable. We will suppose this 
woman to be the &#8216;wife&#8217; of one man, the &#8216;mistress&#8217; of another man, the &#8216;mother&#8217; 
of three children of school age. She is a clothing worker and &#8216;shop steward&#8217;, 
she is &#8216;treasurer' of her local Labour Party, and on Thursday evenings she is a 
&#8216;second violin&#8217; in an amateur orchestra. She has a strong constitution (as she 
must have) but she had a mildly neurotic depressive disposition. She is also (I 
nearly forgot) a member of the Church of England, and an occasional 
&#8216;communicant.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">As you will see, she is kept very busy. Viewed in a certain 
light, she is a point at which a number of &#8216;structures&#8217; intersect. When these 
get on top of her, her depression sometimes takes the form of staying in bed, so 
that she cannot fulfil her other roles. The psychiatrist sees her as being 
determined in her behaviour by a structured neurosis. But she is not 
&#8216;over-determined', her constitution (material basis) is sound, and she soon 
bounces back. As a &#8216;wife&#8217; she is seen by a sociologist as being within &#8216;the 
institution&#8217; of marriage, and performs the &#8216;roles&#8217; of housewife and of mother; 
she is indeed the carrier of these roles. According to his variant of 
sociological theory, he will try to construe her behaviour as a mistress; he has 
difficulty in deciding whether to list it within the category &#8216;deviance&#8217; or 
whether to exclude it from the computer-programme as irrelevant. For the woman 
herself, one part of this &#8216;role&#8217; (the sexual act) is objectively much the same 
with husband or lover; what defines the difference is nothing in the act (well, 
perhaps a little in that) but the expectations and rules which the society 
imposes upon her. She ought to be a better carrier of these expectations, and 
the parson (who has heard about her affair) is censorious.</p>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile, the local branch of the Labour Party, of which she is 
a &#8216;functionary&#8217;, gets into debt. Her husband keep making scenes, and her lover 
is becoming bored. And at work, where she is a <i>trager</i> of proletarian 
productive relations, the boss (the <i>trager</i> etc., etc.,) decides to screw 
down piece-rates. She gets headaches, and stops playing in the orchestra. Beset 
with the contradictory exhortations of psychiatrist, priest, husband, lover, 
society, conductor, boss, fellow workers, party officials, all of whom see her 
as a carrier of this and that, as well as the shopping,, she goes back to bed. 
In bed she reads an article by a demographer, which shows the number of her 
children diverges from the norm, and one by an ecologist which shows that three 
children are too many. Her depression deepens. . .</p>

<p class="fst">We will leave her in this sad state in order to note that none of 
the disciplines or categories have done her any wrong. The demographer has 
correctly described her deviation from the norm, and he has not the least 
interest in her lover, even if she should conceive by him, since the question of 
paternity is irrelevant to this norm. The party official who is seeking to 
collect the branch dues is not in the least concerned with her household 
affairs; he sees her, correctly, as an inefficient functionary. She is in no 
sense the subject of the expectations and sexual norms of &#8216;society&#8217; or of the 
Church, she is the object of their scrutiny. And at work, she may certainly be 
seen as the carrier of productive relations. But not one of these definitions 
affect the fact that she remains a woman. Is the woman then no more than a point 
at which all these relations, structures, roles, expectations, norms and 
functions <i>intersect;</i> is she the carrier of all of them, simultaneously, 
and is she <i>acted</i> by them, and absolutely determined at their 
intersection? It is not by any means an easy question, for many of these roles 
are not only imposed, they are internalised, and they have gathered up like a 
knot inside her head. To answer this question we would have to <i>observe her 
history.</i></p>

<p class="fst">I don&#8217;t know how her history eventuates. I have two alternative 
scripts. One of them is obvious. She is carried off to a mental home, after a 
suicide attempt, and kept going on valium. In the other, she goes back to work, 
because, <i>in the last instance</i>, the mortgage has to be paid and the 
children fed. At work things are blowing up to a crisis. A militant workmate 
(this bit is unlikely) gives her Althusser to read. She turns the pages. 
Enlightenment breaks through. She shouts out: Tm not a bloody THING!&#8217; She throws 
the book at the foreman. She calls out the workshop on strike. She leaves her 
husband and she sacks her lover. She joins the women&#8217;s movement. She leaves the 
Church of England. She rejoins the orchestra, and gready enjoys performing 
within that structure, a process with fifty subjects determined by conductor and 
score. But, alas! She fancies the conductor, and all her muddles are, once 
again, about to begin ...</p>

<p class="fst">As it happens, I do not know this woman, though I have known 
several like her, who have been good comrades, and men like her as well. I have 
introduced her only as the &#8216;bearer' (<i>Träger</i>) of an analogy. The analogy 
may not be pressed too far, because the procedures required to observe the 
behaviour of an individual are not the same as those required to observe 
historical eventuation. We cannot construct our historical or economic knowledge 
by first positing &#8216;individuals&#8217; as isolates. But the analogy will serve if it 
reminds us that, in the people we observe and know, we find intersecting 
determinations, which they are always trying to handle and reconcile; that 
&#8216;over-determination&#8217; can manifest itself as illness or immobility; that it is 
legitimate to view a person as a carrier of structures, but that we can arrive 
at that person only through a sum of many views; that whatever we conclude, in 
the endlessly receding argument of pre-determination and free will - for our 
friend may have been determined by her protestant upbringing to cry out, &#8216;I am 
not a bloody THING!&#8217; - it is profoundly important that our protestant prejudice 
should be renewed, that we should <i>think</i> ourselves to be &#8216;free&#8217; (which 
Althusser will not allow us to think); and that, finally, neither a person nor a 
society may be viewed as a sum of intersecting determinations, but can be known 
only in observation over time.</p>

<p class="fst">We may offer another analogy, which evades the difficulties of 
positing an &#8216;individual&#8217;. We are familiar with analogies drawn from the rules of 
a game. Any complex game is unintelligible until we understand the rules. People 
appear to run around, to start and stop, in arbitrary and confused ways. A 
careful observer (who already has some notion of games) can infer the rules; 
once this has been done, everything becomes clear, and continued observation 
will confirm or refine the rules which he has inferred. The anthropologist or 
historian is in much the same position as the observer. Societies (and a 
&#8216;society&#8217; itself is a concept describing people within an imaginary boundary and 
actuated by common rules) may be seen as very complex &#8216;games&#8217;, which sometimes 
afford very material evidences as to their character (the pitch, the goals, the 
teams), sometimes are governed by visible rules (rule-books of law and 
constitution), and are sometimes governed by invisible rules, which the players 
know so deeply that they are never spoken, and which must be inferred by the 
observer. For example, the players rarely kill the referee.</p>

<p class="fst">The whole of life goes forward within &#8216;structures&#8217; of such 
visible and invisible rules, which prohibit this action and assign a special 
symbolic significance to that. Marx&#8217;s most extraordinary accomplishment was to 
infer -&#8217;read&#8217; - &#8216;de-code&#8217; - the only-partly visible structure of rules by which 
human relations were mediated by money: capital. He often glimpsed, sometimes 
grasped, other invisible rules which we, after one hundred years, are &#8212; or ought 
to be - able to read more plainly. There were other, and significant, symbolic 
and normative rules which (in my view) he overlooked. Some of these were not 
within the view of his contemporary knowledge, and for such rules Political 
Economy had no terms.</p>

<p class="fst">When the rules of a game have been read or inferred, we can then 
assign to each player his role or function in the game. He is (in terms of those 
rules) the game&#8217;s carrier, an element within its structure - a half-back or a 
goal-keeper. In exactly this sense we can say that a &#8216;worker&#8217; is the bearer of 
productive relations; indeed, we have already defined her in this way when we 
called her a &#8216;worker&#8217; rather than a &#8216;second violin&#8217;. But we must take the 
analogy further. For we do not go on to say that the goal-keeper is <i>being 
gamed</i> or the capitalist is <i>being capitaled.</i> This is what Althusser, 
and, also, some structuralist anthropologists and sociologists, would wish us to 
say. Althusser offers us a pseudochoice: either we must say that there are no 
rules but only a swarm of &#8216;individuals&#8217;, or we must say that the rules <i>game</i> 
the players.</p>

<p class="fst">The difference between &#8216;playing&#8217; a game and being gamed 
illustrates the difference between rule-governed structuration of historical 
eventuation (within which men and women remain as subjects of their own history) 
and structuralism. As always, Althusser has simply taken over a reigning fashion 
of bourgeois ideology and named it &#8216;Marxism&#8217;. In the old days, vulgar Political 
Economy saw men&#8217;s economic behaviour as being <i>lawed</i> (although workers 
were obtuse and refractory in obeying these laws), but allowed to the autonomous 
individual an area of freedom, in his intellectual, aesthetic or moral choices. 
Today, structuralisms engross this area from every side; we are <i>structured</i> 
by social relations, <i>spoken</i> by pre-given linguistic structures, <i>
thought</i> by ideologies, <i>dreamed</i> by myths, <i>gendered</i> by 
patriarchal sexual norms, <i>bonded</i> by affective obligations, cultured by 
mentalites, and acted by history&#8217;s script. None of these ideas is, in origin, 
absurd, and some rest upon substantial additions to knowledge. But all slip, at 
a certain point, from sense to absurdity, and, in their sum, all arrive at a 
common terminus of unfreedom. Structuralism (this terminus of the absurd) is the 
ultimate product of self-alienated reason - &#8216;reflecting&#8217; the common-sense of the 
times - in which all human projects, endeavours, institutions, and even culture 
itself, appear to stand <i>outside</i> of men, to stand <i>against</i> men, as 
objective things, as the &#8216;Other&#8217; which, in its own turn, moves men around as 
things. In the old days, the Other was then named &#8216;God&#8217; or Fate. Today it has 
been christened anew as Structure.</p>

<p class="fst">I have said that Marx made visible the &#8216;rules&#8217; of capital. To do 
this, it was necessary to proceed by way of a &#8216;Critique of Political Economy,&#8217; 
In this way he was able to construct the concept of a capitalist &#8216;mode&#8217; of 
production, both as the circuit of capital and as a mode of self-reproduction, 
by which capital reproduced the productive relations which enabled its own 
reproduction. This mode of production could then be conceptualised as an <i>
integral</i> structure, in which all relations must be taken together as one 
set, and in which each rule is assigned its definition within that totality. 
From this he adduced (although sometimes wrongly) the forms of development 
through such a mode might pass, and, further (and more rashly) he projected its 
&#8216;law of motion&#8217; into the future. That these &#8216;laws&#8217; or &#8216;tendencies&#8217; did not (as 
he once truculently asserted) work &#8216;with iron necessity towards inevitable 
results&#8217; may be explained, in part, by the fact that he understated the 
countervailing tendencies at work. Contrary to the view of some theoretical 
practitioners, no worker known to historians ever had surplus-value taken out of 
his hide without finding some way of fighting back (there are plenty of ways of 
going slow); and, paradoxically, <i>by</i> his fighting back the tendencies were 
diverted and the &#8216;forms of development&#8217; were themselves developed in unexpected 
ways. In another part, this was due to the fact that other countervailing 
tendencies arrived unbidden out of &#8216;regions&#8217; for which Political Economy had no 
terms.</p>

<p class="fst">But these reservations do not in any way go to show that Marx&#8217;s 
project was not legitimate. It was an epoch-making advance in knowledge to 
construct, by arduous theoretical engagement, by hypothesis and by equally 
arduous empirical investigation, the concept of a structured mode of production 
in this way.</p>

<p class="fst">&#8216;Aha!&#8217;, I am asked: &#8216;Is this not to give back to Althusser with 
my left hand all that I have taken away with my right? And is not Althusser 
licensed to envisage capitalism as structure?&#8217; The answer is &#8216;no&#8217;. And whoever 
asked that question may go to the back of the class. A capitalist mode of 
production is not capitalism. We pass on the exchange of one letter from the 
adjectival characterisation of a mode of production (a concept within Political 
Economy, albeit within Marxist &#8216;anti&#8217; Political Economy) to a noun descriptive 
of a social formation in the totality of its relations. We will leave our 
interrogator on the back bench for a few pages, to meditate upon his folly, and 
return to the mode of production.</p>

<p class="fst">After all the rancour of my previous critique, this should at 
last be the occasion for a happy reunion. For historians within the Marxist 
tradition have for many decades employed the concept of a mode of production, 
have examined the labour process and the relations of production. I can recall a 
time, in this country, when there were not many of us, when this was our 
distinctive preoccupation, and one which was decidedly disreputable. And now - 
not only among Althusserians, but among theoretical practitioners very generally 
- the &#8216;mode of production&#8217; has become the focus of a truly obsessional 
preoccupation. This, decidedly, is their &#8216;thing&#8217;. They are always undoing it and 
doing it up again. They are always examining its &#8216;mechanism&#8217;; rearranging its 
components; inserting a new pinion here, a balance-wheel there, and oiling the 
moving parts with purified abstractions. The &#8216;mode of production&#8217; has become 
like a base camp in the Arctic of Theory, which the explorers may not depart 
from for more than a hundred yards for fear of being lost in an ideological 
blizzard.</p>

<p class="fst">What is odd about this &#8216;mode of production&#8217; is that it can be 
constructed and reconstructed with Theory without any recourse to the knowledge 
of historians, anthropologists and others. Althusser and Balibar are too 
rigorous even to acknowledge the findings of these disciplines; Hindess and 
Hirst show a casual acquaintance with some secondary work, and employ themselves 
in demonstrating that this work (being ideological in origin) is unnecessary to 
Theory; and historians repay these tributes, not with anger, but with boredom. 
They do not reply, or argue, simply because the whole project of theoretical 
practice is idealist and irrelevant. For theoretical practice engenders these 
modes. of production, not within theory or society, but within metaphysics; and 
a metaphysical mode of production, in its turn, will produce, not commodities, 
but metaphysical concepts.and categories, while at the same time reproducing 
endlessly its own conditions for metaphysical self-reproduction. Like all cooks 
of the Absolute, these practitioners have found the instant theoretical recipe, 
the handful of wholesome ingredients out of which all history and every society 
is baked.</p>

<p class="fst">So that this is not, after all, a place of happy reunion but a 
place of total disassociation between incompatible methods and traditions. It is 
as if a conference were to be held, with, on the one hand, all those concerned 
with sexual relations, gender roles, the forms and history of the family, 
kinship structures, child nurture, homosexuality, sexual psychology, the 
literature of profane and romantic love; and, on the other hand, a party of 
theoretical practitioners who had reduced all this to the metaphysical 
contemplation of the reproductive organs, which produce all these 
&#8216;manifestations' and which, at the same time, reproduce themselves. One party 
would attain to knowledge through the investigation of a multiplicity of 
evidence in its own authentic expression; the other would be locked into a 
metaphysical circuit of ovulation and sperm. The participants would be baffled. 
They would decide to disengage, and continue their proceedings in separate 
rooms. As theoretical practice and historical materialism have done.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not a question of disagreement about this or that, but one 
of total incompatibility in the way in which a historian and such a &#8216;theorist&#8217; 
situates himself before a mode of production. We have authorities on &#8216;productive 
relations&#8217; who have never looked inside a feudal tenure, or a bill of exchange, 
or a woollen Piece Hall, or a struggle around piece-rates; and we have 
authorities on &#8216;the labour process&#8217; who have never found relevant to their 
exalted theory Christopher Hill&#8217;s work on &#8216;the uses of Sabbatarianism&#8217;, nor mine 
on &#8216;time and work-discipline&#8217;, nor Eric Hobsbawm&#8217;s on &#8216;the tramping artisan&#8217;, 
nor that of a generation of (American, French, British) &#8216;labour historians&#8217; (a 
group often dismissed with scorn<a href="#n153" name="fn153" target="_self">[153]</a>) 
on time-and-motion study, Taylorism, and Fordism.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not only that this kind of theoretical idealism is actively 
unhelpful: that, for example, in the immense area of study recently opened up, 
the study of peasant societies (in which so much turns on subsistence economy, 
taxation and marketing, traditional norms and needs, inheritance practices, 
familial modes, particularist customary law), theoretical practitioners are left 
fiddling with their model trying to take into account the rural millions who are 
somehow &#8216;marginal&#8217; to the proper circuits of capital It is not only that gross 
historical materiality stubbornly refuses to &#8216;correspond&#8217; to the purity of its 
concept; that, whatever theoretical allowance is made for &#8216;contradiction&#8217; it is 
never allowance enough, for in every historical &#8216;now&#8217; (conjuncture) the circuit 
of capital is being obstructed and resisted at every point - as men and women 
refuse to be reduced to its <i>trager</i> - so that the &#8216;forms&#8217; are &#8216;developed&#8217; 
and diverted in theoretically improper ways by the class struggle itself. It is 
also that this idealism is actively misleading and diversionary, giving us false 
historical results at every turn, imposing its own presuppositions upon the 
evidence, blockading all the &#8216;empirical' canals of the senses of knowledge, and, 
as contemporary political theory, leading only to bizarre kangaroo strategies 
(in which conclusions are already pre-empted by the arbitrary premises of this 
party or that sect) or else to the security of an arm-chair.</p>

<p class="fst">But is not this dismissal unfair? Is not theoretical practice, 
with its &#8216;relative autonomy&#8217; and its intricate gearing, greatly more subtle and 
rigorous than the &#8216;vulgar economism&#8217; which it displaced? The answer, in brief, 
is that this is a &#8216;yes-type&#8217; question: to which we must reply &#8216;no&#8217;. It is a 
&#8216;yes-type&#8217; question because it reduces to a faceless and unidentifiable 
caricature all precedent theory and practice, and seeks to erase any evidence as 
to the vigorous alternative tradition on behalf of which I speak. And the reply 
must be &#8216;no&#8217;, because, despite all its abstraction and saving clauses, the 
theoretical product is an idealist reductionism as vulgar in its economism as 
anything that has gone before.</p>

<p class="fst">We will, however, allow a more leisurely answer. And in this we 
may first offer an apology to Marxist economists. The theory of a mode of 
production belongs, very properly, within their own conceptual system. It is 
proper that it should be interrogated and refined. The continuing debates among 
economists may well be significant, and historians hope to be helped by their 
findings. More generally, the employment of the concept of a mode of production 
is an improvement upon a certain slipshod use of the terms &#8216;material base&#8217; and 
&#8216;productive forces&#8217; - or it could be an improvement, in minds open to any 
empirical conversation. As Williams has noted:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It was not Marxism, but the systems with which it contended 
and continues to contend, which had separated and abstracted various parts of 
this whole social process. It was the assertion and explanation of political 
forms and philosophical and general ideas as independent of, &#8216;above&#8217;, the 
material social process that produced a necessary kind of counter-assertion. In 
the flow of polemic this was often overstated, until it came to repeat, in a 
simple reversal of terms, the kind of error it attacked.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Hence Marxism &#8216;often took the colouring of a specifically 
bourgeois and capitalist kind of materialism.&#8217;<a href="#n154" name="fn154" target="_self">[154]</a> 
This is certainly true. But, then it is also &#8212; and for the same reasons - true 
that to reduce all social and intellectual phenomena to &#8216;effects&#8217; of an 
essentialist, metaphysical &#8216;mode of production&#8217; - by whatever elaboration of 
&#8216;mechanisms&#8217; - is to do no more than enclose that old bourgeois materialism 
within idealist amber.</p>

<p class="fst">There is also, we will allow, a great difference in the quality 
of theoretical practice. It is possible to practice upon a mode of production 
badly or well. Balibar practices so badly that he allows no purchase for a 
historian&#8217;s interrogation. But Simon Clarke, practising on Althusser and 
Balibar, is able to illuminate their inconsistencies and absurdities in the 
clearest ways, and hence to emerge, by way of critique, with a lucid restatement 
of the concept of a mode of production. I find this helpful, and, at the same 
time, I am relieved of the labour of going over the same task. Clarke has 
evidently come to the very verge of the kangaroo reserve. But he is not yet 
quite over that verge. For he is able, when discussing &#8216;different forms of 
society&#8217;, to write:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The relations of production on which these various modes of 
production are based will provide the basis for difference forms of 
exploitation, and correspondingly different relations of distribution. They will 
also be expressed in specific economic, ideological and political forms, which 
must be analysed as <i>developed</i> forms of the fundamental relation of 
production.&#8221;<a href="#n155" name="fn155" target="_self">[155]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This is the same kind of circular act which we noted in Smelser, 
where the snake ate its own tail; instead of a &#8216;value-system&#8217;, the &#8216;fundamental 
relation of production&#8217; is swallowing its own effects. And the critical problem 
lies in the last few lines - &#8216;economic, ideological and political forms . . . 
must be analysed as <i>developed</i> forms of the fundamental relation of 
production/ The essentialist notion of &#8216;immanance&#8217;, the ultimate platonism, lies 
there.</p>

<p class="fst">Should we return to Marx? Or should we argue the point, 
independent of any authority? Let us try to do both together. It is certainly 
true - and it is generally held to be a fundamental &#8216;Marxist' proposition - that 
there is some correspondence between a given mode of production and a social 
formation (including political and ideological forms). This is hardly 
surprising, since production, social relations, political modes, and ideological 
constructions are all human activities. The Marxist proposition goes further, 
and asserts not only &#8216;some correspondence&#8217;, but a correspondence in which the 
mode of production is determinate. Marx and Engels expressed this correspondence 
and this determination in a number of different ways; by the elaborate (but, 
ultimately, mechanical and unsatisfactory) spatial analogy of &#8216;basis&#8217; and 
&#8216;superstructure&#8217;; by means of blunt propositions, such as &#8216;social being 
determines social consciousness&#8217; (itself a polemical &#8216;counter-assertion&#8217; of the 
kind indicated by Williams); by enigmatic but suggestive analogies from natural 
science ('a general illumination in which all other colours are plunged&#8217;); and 
by swift metaphorical gestures - the hand-mill '<i>gives you</i> society with 
the feudal lord&#8217;, religious ideologies are a &#8216;<i>reflection&quot;</i> of productive 
relations, which <i>'appear as&#8217;</i> categories within Political Economy, and 
these relations reveal &#8216;that the innermost secret, the hidden basis of the 
entire social structure, and . . . the corresponding specific form of the 
State.&#8217;<a href="#n156" name="fn156" target="_self">[156]</a> When we recall that 
some reciprocal interaction is also proposed (e.g. as between &#8216;superstructure&#8217; 
and &#8216;basis&#8217;) there is &#8216;play&#8217; enough in these propositions to allow for many 
adjustments and interpretations.</p>

<p class="fst">Presented with these indecisive propositions, the practitioner 
who works within a &#8216;Marxist&#8217; tradition might take one or two courses. He might 
decide to select among them for the &#8216;correct' and &#8216;scientific&#8217; formulation; 
screw it down more tightly; tinker with the &#8216;mechanism&#8217;; eliminate all &#8216;play&#8217;; 
theorise about the &#8216;society effect&#8217; and the &#8216;ideological effect&#8217;; and perfect an 
orrery. I suppose that one may condone this course in a certain kind of 
philosopher or theologian, who has never engaged in the difficult labour of 
reconstituting from historical materials an actualised mode of production, who 
does not understand the historian&#8217;s necessary recourse to analogies and 
metaphorical suggestions as an indication of the connections and direction of 
the social process, and mistakes these for literal statements as to some 
&#8216;mechanism.&#8217; He has never heard a stick break in the forest as a commoner 
disputes his rights with the King, nor listened to the anguished silence and 
then the hysterical saturnalia as a heretic is burned. He thinks it can all be 
plotted in a map in his head: this basis, that terrain, this region, level and 
instance. In the end he thinks that his thinking makes it so: &#8216;the process that 
produces the concrete-knowledge takes place wholly in the theoretical practice.&#8217; 
(<i>EM.</i> 186)</p>

<p class="fst">There is, however, another possible course. We may commence with 
these various propositions as hypotheses, and then we may <i>find out.</i> This 
will lead us at once into a very different set of questions. Are these 
propositions true? Did Marx show them to be true, or did he assume them without 
further testing? If they are true, are they significant and suggestive, or are 
they truisms which still leave everything to be found out? And, again, if they 
are true, <i>why</i> are they true? In what ways, and through which means, does 
this correspondence assert itself? And, finally, does our new knowledge (gained 
in response to such questions) enable us to return again to Marx, not to adjust 
and tighten up one formulation, but to modify and re-organise his concepts?</p>

<p class="fst">The alternative Marxist tradition has been asking these kinds of 
questions for some decades. I don&#8217;t hold power of attorney to speak for 
&#8216;history&#8217;, so that I can only report my own understanding of historical 
knowledge. The first question - &#8216;are these propositions true?&#8217; - is, alas, an 
&#8216;empirical&#8217; one. In my own view, they <i>have</i> been shown to be true, but in 
terms even more lax, and equivocal,than those of Marx. In diverse historical 
circumstances, research has shown that &#8216;the economic movement finally asserts 
itself as necessary&#8217;; the comparative study of feudal societies, or of 
industrial revolutions, has demonstrated the ways in which a generic mode of 
production has found roughly analogous expression within different societies and 
state institutions; and Marx&#8217;s most fertile hypothesis (as stated in his 
well-known letter to Weydemeyer of 1852) that <i>the existence of classes</i> is 
only bound up with <i>particular, historic phases in the development of 
production</i>, seems to me to have been demonstrated beyond doubt, and with 
many con-sequent riders as to analogous forms of class expression within 
intellectual and social life.</p>

<p class="fst">But the findings, while positive, has been equivocal. They 
suggest not only a greater complexity and reciprocity of relations than Marx 
proposed, but also they raise the question of what significance we can place 
upon the correspondence. The complexity, as I have sufficiently argued, is not 
in the least illuminated by giving to it a reputable new name, like &#8216;relative 
autonomy&#8217; (see p. 132). The critical concept (unexamined by Althusser) is that 
of&#8216;determination&#8217; itself; hence the importance - as Williams and I and others 
have been insisting for years (and to the deaf) of defining &#8216;determine&#8217; in its 
senses of&#8216;setting limits&#8217; and &#8216;exerting pressures&#8217; and of defining &#8216;law of 
motion&#8217; as logic of process.&#8217; This helps us, at once, to break out of the 
idealist circuit; we can no longer offer social formations as &#8216;society effects&#8217; 
or as &#8216;developed forms&#8217; of an immanent mode.</p>

<p class="fst">The question as to the significance to be placed upon the 
correspondence is even more difficult. For the idealist notion commences with 
the proposition that &#8216;the economic&#8217; is (in the last instance, etc.) determining, 
and then leaps, hand-in-hand with its twin, vulgar &#8216;economism&#8217;, to the good old 
utilitarian assumption that it is therefore somehow more &#8216;real&#8217; in all ways. 
Once landed here, theoretical practice can deploy a number of arguments. Thus 
if, in a given society, the decisive region appears to be non-economic (kinship, 
military power), then this can simply be re-defined as the area to which the 
&#8216;economic instance&#8217; has been &#8216;assigned&#8217; (see p. 197). More commonly, other areas 
are simply regarded as being <i>less</i> real - as second or third-order 
problems, as the concern of another &#8216;region&#8217; of theory (as yet immature and 
undeveloped), or simply as nonproblems, which may be spirited away with the wand 
of &#8216;relative autonomy.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">But it is of little consolation to a prisoner, languishing in 
1976 in the foetid and overcrowded compound of a Calcutta gaol, to be told that 
his is a third-order problem, and that he is the victim of a relatively 
autonomous society effect. Worse than this: the half-hidden assumption, that 
what is &#8216;relatively autonomous&#8217; is therefore less &#8216;real&#8217; (and less deserving of 
theoretical or historical attention) than the mode of production, can afford to 
the theoretical practitioner, if whim or ideology should strike him, a 
stupefying laxity in analysis. Indeed, religions, ideologies, and the State 
itself, with all its armoury of repressive apparatuses, being &#8216;relatively 
autonomous&#8217;, may develop, over half-centuries or centuries, <i>in any way they 
like,</i> and the theorists of the &#8216;mode of production&#8217;, in the security of 
their self-confirming propositions, need not turn a theoretical hair. For they 
have already defined this mode as being essential and truly real, and the 
effects, or regions, or levels, may go on their autonomous way. In exactly this 
way, in 1963, Althusser waves his wand, and Stalinism (unless as a third-order 
problem) was made to disappear:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Everything that has been said of the &#8220;cult of the 
personality&#8221; refers exactly to the domain of the <i>superstructure</i> and 
therefore of State organisation and ideologies; further it refers largely to <i>
this domain alone</i>, which we know from Marxist theory possesses a &#8220;relative 
autonomy&#8221; (which explains very simply, in theory, how the socialist <i>
infrastructure</i> has been able to develop without essential damage during this 
period of errors affecting the superstructure).&quot; (<i>F.M.</i> 240)</p>

<p class="fst">Very simple. But this arbitrary separation of a &#8216;mode of 
production&#8217; from everything that actually goes on in history (so characteristic 
of the idealist/economist twin) ends up by telling us nothing and apologising 
for everything. Such Theory is rather like a doctor who, when his patient is in 
agony with a disease, consults for an hour, and then pronounces that, while the 
disease is determined in the last instance by the body, it is a relatively 
autonomous body-effect. As indeed it is; the disease is not a projection of the 
patient&#8217;s soul; but medicine learned this many centuries ago. And for a long 
time this spurious dissociation of &#8216;production&#8217;/'consciousness&#8217; - itself only 
the old dichotomy matter/mind or body/soul reappearing in Marxist form - has 
been challenged, in the Marxist tradition, on one side by historians and 
anthropologists, who have insisted that ideas, norms and rules be replaced <i>
within</i> the mode of production, without which it could not be carried on for 
a day;<a href="#n157" name="fn157" target="_self">[157]</a> and on the other 
side by cultural materialists who have insisted that the notion of a 
&#8216;superstructure&#8217; &#8216;was never materialist enough.&#8217;<a href="#n158" name="fn158" target="_self">[158]</a> 
&#8216;Determination&#8217; is a large, self-important word, which appears to pronounce on 
each case with finality. But when it has driven away in its Bentley, we are left 
to discover that everything is still to be found out. To revert to our earlier 
analogy, there may be a true sense in which a man&#8217;s neurotic state may be 
determined in the last instance by his sexual nature, which, in its turn, is 
determined by his male reproductive organs. But this does not make his neurosis 
any less &#8216;real&#8217;, nor are we likely to understand it or cure it by prolonged 
scrutiny of his penis. And, moreover, to complicate the matter further, one 
symptom of his neurosis may be precisely, to render him impotent. It is a 
simplistic analogy, since societies are as complex as persons but in different 
ways. But these two reservations - as to the complexity of the &#8216;correspondence&#8217; 
and as to its significance - are so severe as to call in question the 
effectivity of Marx&#8217;s general notions. Very few of the critically-significant 
(the most &#8216;real&#8217;) problems which we confront in our actual lives appear to be <i>
directly</i> and causally implicated in this field of correspondence: 
nationalism, racism, sexual repression, Fascism, and Stalinism itself are 
certainly not removed from this field (for the pressure of class antagonisms and 
class-based ideologies can be felt in all), but equally certainly they cannot be 
seen as &#8216;developed forms of the fundamental relation of production&#8217;; they are 
forms in their own right, and for their analysis we require (just as the 
psychiatrist requires) a new set of terms, not entailed within the premises of 
Political Economy.</p>

<p class="fst">This is not to say that Marx&#8217;s propositions were wrong, although 
they were sometimes expressed so over-confidently that they licensed wrong 
conclusions. It was important to learn that neurosis was not caused by Satanic 
possession, and important to learn that human affairs did not express the mind 
of divine providence, or of great men, or of unfolding Ideas, or of a benevolent 
class-neutered market. Marx took knowledge across a threshold, pointed her 
towards the world, and told her to go and <i>find out.</i> And in that outer 
world, beyond the secure &#8216;base&#8217; of the mode of production, many of the most 
cherished of human concerns are sited.</p>

<p class="fst">Moreover, this raises in a new way the whole problem of the 
effectivity of human agency, of men and women as subjects of their own history. 
Within the secure circuits of a mode of production, it is easy enough for 
Althusser to envisage men as <i>träger</i>, and to relapse into exactly the same 
mode of thought as that which Marx identified in Proudhon; &#8216;From his point of 
view man is only the instrument of which the Idea or the eternal reason makes 
use in order to unfold itself.'<a href="#n159" name="fn159" target="_self">[159]</a> 
But in the world outside that door, it might possibly be shown that agency had 
larger scope to exercise its effects. To be sure, this agency will not be set 
free from ulterior determinate pressures nor escape determinate limits. It is 
unlikely to hasten on the resolution of the extraordinary complexity and 
contradictions of India&#8217;s overlapping modes of production. But it might be able 
to open the gate to the Calcutta gaol and set our prisoner free. Indeed, it has 
done exactly that. It might even be able to resist or to legitimate the dominant 
ideological pressures of our time. It might collapse into complicity with 
Stalinist predestinarianism, or it might reason with Althusser and help to 
liberate from his influence another mind.</p>

<p class="fst">Moreover, if we look towards any future described as &#8216;socialist&#8217;, 
there is no error more disabling and actively dangerous to the practice of any 
human freedom than the notion that there is some &#8216;socialist&#8217; mode of production 
(as public or State ownership of the means of production) within which some 
&#8216;socialist&#8217; relations or production are <i>given,</i> which will afford a 
categorical guarantee that some immanent socialist society (values, ideas, 
institutions, etc.) will <i>unfold itself:</i> not, perhaps, instantaneously 
(for there is &#8216;relative autonomy&#8217;, etc. etc.) but in good time, out of the womb 
of the mode of production itself. This is wholly untrue: every choice and every 
institution is still to be made, and to suppose otherwise is to fall into an 
error as astonishing in its mystical crudity as Althusser&#8217;s notion that under 
Stalin the &#8216;socialist <i>infrastructure</i>&#8217; was able &#8216;to develop without 
essential damage.&#8217; (p. 216) So far from Theory affording to us such comforting 
guarantees, the appearance, within parties and ideologies which claim themselves 
to be in the &#8216;vanguard&#8217; of socialist endeavour, of metaphysical theologies so 
monstrous (within which will, choice, value, and men and women themselves 
disappear) is a most ominous premonition. We must liberate our minds <i>now;</i> 
if that ideology should ever claim a share in power it will be too late.</p>

<h3><a name="h15">xv</a></h3>

<p class="fst">We may now attempt to bring this argument together. I proposed, 
in an earlier section, that the hypotheses of historical materialism and the 
&#8216;anti&#8217; Political Economy of <i>Capital</i> were, however, closely related, 
distinct. This was clearly stated by Marx in his preface to the &#8216;Paris 
Manuscripts&#8217; (1844) when he outlined his impossibly ambitious life-project:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I will therefore, present one after another a critique of 
law, of morality, politics, etc., in different independent brochures and then 
finally in a separate work try to show the connection of the whole and the 
relationship of the parts to each other and end with a criticism of the 
elaboration of the material by speculative philosophy. Therefore, in the present 
work the connection of the Political Economy with the state, law, morality, 
civil life, etc. <i>is only dealt with in so far as Political Economy itself 
professes to deal with these subjects</i>.&#8221;<a href="#n160" name="fn160" target="_self">[160]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile, the hypotheses of historical materialism (&#8216;the 
relationship of the parts to each other&#8217;) were rapidly presented, between 1845 
and 1848, in <i>The German Ideology, The Poverty of Philosophy</i>, and <i>The 
Communist Manifesto</i>. Frederick Engels played a major part in the development 
of these hypotheses and, behind Engels, we find the direct influence of the 
class organisations and class consciousness of the British working-class 
movement; as Stedman Jones has shown, in a helpful study, Engels was too modest 
as to his own part in this joint production,<a href="#n161" name="fn161" target="_self">[161]</a> 
and there is thus the greater reason to attend with respect to the <i>caveats</i> 
in his late letters.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus the hypotheses of historical materialism were already 
presented by 1848. These hypotheses Engels resumed in several of his subsequent 
prefaces to editions of the <i>Manifesto</i>. Thus (to the German edition of 
1883):</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The basic thought running through the Manifesto - that 
economic production and the structure of society of every historical epoch 
necessarily arising therefrom constitute the foundation for the political and 
intellectual history of that epoch; that consequently ... all history has been a 
history of class struggles . . . this basic thought belongs solely and 
exclusively to Marx.&#8221;<a href="#n162" name="fn162" target="_self">[162]</a></p>

<p class="fst">These propositions, Engels claimed in his preface to the English 
edition of 1888, were &#8216;destined to do for history what Darwin&#8217;s theory has done 
for biology.&#8217; Nevertheless, as we have seen (pp. 90-91), these hypotheses 
remained largely undeveloped over the next forty years; they were elaborated 
more by Engels than by Marx, and at the end of his life Engels could clearly see 
that &#8216;only a little has been done.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile, and for at least twenty years, Marx had turned aside 
to wrestle with his antagonist, Political Economy, and in this contest to 
elaborate what I have argued (p. 80) may be seen as itself an &#8216;anti-structure&#8217; 
to that structure. I have argued that Marx was himself, for a time, trapped 
within the circuits of capital - an immanence manifesting itself in &#8216;forms&#8217; - 
and that he only partly sprung that trap in <i>Capital.</i> It is to this trap 
(the <i>Grundrisse</i> face of Marx) that theoretical practice so eagerly 
returns;<a href="#n163" name="fn163" target="_self">[163]</a> it is from the 
heart of this trap that Althusser extracts his textual licences of authority, 
and he wishes to return us to the conceptual prison (mode of production = social 
formation) that had been imposed upon Marx by his bourgeois antagonist. How far 
Marx himself ever became fully aware of his imprisonment is a complex question, 
and not one which (in my view) is of much importance to the present advance of 
knowledge. We are interested in advancing history, and the understanding of 
history, and not in Marxology. But at least we should note, that Marx, in his 
increasing preoccupation in his last years with anthropology, was resuming the 
projects of his Paris youth,'<a href="#n164" name="fn164" target="_self">[164]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The problem, as we have sufficiently argued, is to move from the 
circuits of capital to capitalism; from a highly-conceptualised and abstracted 
mode of production, within which determinism appears as absolute, to historical 
determinations as the exerting of pressures, as a logic of process within a 
larger (and sometimes countervailing) process. It would, of course, be 
ridiculous to suggest that Marx, in <i>Capital</i>, did not repeatedly come to 
the margin between Political Economy and history, structure and process, and 
repeatedly gesture - often in greatly enlightening ways - as to the pressure of 
the first upon the forms and logic of the second. But the gestures <i>remain 
hypotheses;</i> they are assumed rather than shown to be so; and, moreover, the 
assumptions are supported by the prior hypotheses of historical materialism, 
which long precede <i>Capital</i>, but which have been left both undeveloped and 
unexamined. And the problems arise, repeatedly, at what I have called the 
&#8216;junction-concepts&#8217; (p. 149): &#8216;need&#8217;, which may reappear within anthropology as 
&#8216;norm&#8217; and within history as &#8216;wants&#8217; or &#8216;values&#8217;; &#8216;mode of production&#8217; which may 
reappear as a determining pressure within a complex historical process; &#8216;class&#8217;, 
as posited as the structuring of a mode of production, or as eventuating in ways 
which may never be pre-determined (as historians have sufficiently shown); 
&#8216;determination&quot; itself, as closure or as pressure.</p>

<p class="fst">Moreover, Political Economy, including Marx&#8217;s &#8216;anti&#8217; structure, 
had no terms - had deliberately, and for the purposes of its analytical science, <i>
excluded</i> the terms - which become, immediately, essential if we are to 
comprehend societies and histories. Political Economy has terms for use-value, 
for exchange-value, for monetary value, and for surplus-value, but not for 
normative value. It has no terms for other areas of consciousness: how does one 
do the symbolic rituals of Tyburn or of Lenin&#8217;s (or, now, Mao&#8217;s) mausoleum into 
terms of value, price and profit? We may hypothesise that one &#8216;vocabulary&#8217; will 
&#8216;reappear&#8217; within the other, but we still do not know how, by what means or 
mediations. And it is here that we find that Engels&#8217;s analogy between Darwin and 
Marx was, in one respect, even closer than he intended. For just as Darwin 
proposed and demonstrated an evolutionary process which proceeded by means of a 
hypothetical transmutation of the species - species which had hitherto been 
hypostatised as immutable and fixed - and yet remained wholly in the dark as to 
the actual genetic means of this transmission and transmutation - so, in an 
analogous way, historical materialism, as a hypothesis, was left unprovided with 
its own &#8216;genetics.&#8217; If a correspondence could be proposed - and, in some part, 
demonstrated - between a mode of production and historical process, how, and in 
what ways, did this come about? It is an important question: because one answer 
will be simply to set aside the problem unanswered. And theology will then say 
that evolution manifests the peculiar working-out of the divine will, while 
theoretical practice will then say that history manifests the &#8216;development of 
the forms&#8217; of capital. The other answer (the tradition of Mendel, and of 
historical and cultural materialism) will be to <i>find out.</i></p>

<p class="fst">What we have found out (in my view) lies within a missing term: 
&#8216;human experience.&#8217; This is, exactly, the term which Althusser and his followers 
wish to blackguard out of the club of thought under the name of &#8216;empiricism.&#8217; 
Men and women also return as subjects, within this term - not as autonomous 
subjects, &#8216;free individuals&#8217;, but as persons experiencing their determinate 
productive situations and relationships, as needs and interests and as 
antagonisms, and then &#8216;handling&#8217; this experience within their <i>consciousness</i> 
and their <i>culture</i> (two other terms excluded by theoretical practice) in 
the most complex (yes, &#8216;relatively autonomous&#8217;) ways, and then (often but not 
always through the ensuing structures of class) acting upon their determinate 
situation in their turn.</p>

<p class="fst">It must be emphasised that, while this is not incompatible with 
the hypotheses of Engels and Marx, it is not exactly the same as their 
propositions. For we have introduced one term, &#8216;culture&#8217;, which in its 
&#8216;anthropological&#8217; derivation, Althusser would deplore, and which in its 
subsequent definition and elaboration within historical knowledge was not 
available to Marx. It is a term which I am wholly committed to defend, and to 
defend, if Marxologists insist that it is necessary, <i>against</i> Marx. For it 
is not true that Marx passed over in innocence the need to provide his theory 
with some &#8216;genetics&#8217;. He attempted such a provision, first, in this writings on 
alienation, commodity, fetishism, and reification; and, second, in his notion of 
man, in his history, continuously making over his own nature. (We will only note 
in passing, since other critics have examined this question, that Althusser 
excludes all exploration of either set of suggestive notions from this canon). 
Of the first set of concepts I wish only to say this: they propose to supply a 
&#8216;genetics&#8217; - to explain how history is determined in ways which conflict with 
the conscious intentions of its subjects - in terms of mystified <i>rationality.</i> 
Men imprison themselves within structures of their own creation because they are <i>
self-mystified.</i> While historians may find these notions suggestive in 
certain areas (as in the study of ideologies), they would argue - I certainly 
will argue - that, in more general application, they are the product of an 
overly-rational mind; they offer an explanation in terms of mystified 
rationality for now-rational or irrational behaviour and belief, whose sources 
may not be educed from reason. As to the second set of concepts (man making over 
his own nature), while they are important and point the right way, they remain 
so undeveloped that, in effect, they do little more than restate the prior 
question in new terms: we are still left to <i>find out</i> &#8216;how&#8217;?</p>

<p class="fst">Thus we return to the missing terms, &#8216;experience&#8217;, and at once we 
enter into the real silences of Marx. This is not only a point of junction 
between &#8216;structure&#8217; and &#8216;process&#8217;, but a point of <i>dis</i>-junction between 
alternative and incompatible traditions. For one tradition, that of idealist 
dogma, these &#8216;silences&#8217; are blanknesses or absences of &#8216;rigour&#8217; in Marx 
(failures fully to theorise his own concepts), and they must be sewn together by 
bridging concepts, conceptually generated from the same conceptual matrix. But, 
as we have seen (p. 150), this pursuit of the security of a perfect totalised 
theory is the original heresy against knowledge. Such perfect idealist 
creations, each seam superbly joined by invisible conceptual stitching, always 
end up in the jumble sale. If Marx had really designed a Theory like that, it 
would be down in the bargain basement already, along with Spencer, Dühring, and 
Comte, to be snapped up by some graduate student looking for a bizarre patch of 
material to sew onto her doctoral jeans.</p>

<p class="fst">In its present incarnation as &#8216;theoretical practice&#8217;, this notion 
of Theory is like a blight that has settled on the mind. The empirical senses 
are occluded, the moral and aesthetic organs are repressed, the curiosity is 
sedated, all the &#8216;manifest&#8217; evidence of life or of art is distrusted as 
&#8216;ideology&#8217;, the theoretical ego enlarges (for everyone else is mystified by 
&#8216;appearances&#8217;), and the devotees gather intensely around the Mode of Production. 
Like the approaches to the altar of Lakshmi in an ancient Hindu temple, the 
passages are long, slippery, and ornate, but there at length she is, the goddess 
of material wealth, encrusted with gold and jewels, roped with garlands, and 
with nothing visible but her huge enigmatic eyes. They do her obeisance, and 
incant her several names, <i>La Structure a Dominante</i>, The Mode, the CMP. 
The rites which they perform are sometimes pitiful, sometimes comic. Critics 
struggle to decode poems as the reenactment of theory or of ideology in opaque 
terms. And behind these terms lies The Mode, the CMP. Just as, in the inert 
platonism of their theory, all culture and all social life has been reduced to 
the Mode, so their vocabulary is stewed down until it is reduced to the same 
de-natured glue.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;A double-articulation GMP/GI-GI/AI/LMP is, for example, 
possible, whereby a GI category, when transformed by AI into an ideological 
component of an LMP, may then enter into conflict with the GMP social relations 
it exists to reproduce.&#8221;<a href="#n165" name="fn165" target="_self">[165]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is kind of this literary critic to provide us with an 
&#8216;example&#8217;. But to suppose this to advance a &#8216;science&#8217; of materialist aesthetics 
is to calumniate both science and materialism.</p>

<p class="fst">Not all the rites are so whole-hearted. The pilgrims are 
sometimes critical and querulous. But since, in some part of their hearts, they 
still wish to worship the Absolute, they do not repudiate but seek only to amend 
the rites. Hence the problems (which they can really see) are reduced to 
pseudo-problems within a conceptual system designed to repel their solution. 
Even excellent historians, who ought to know better (and who perhaps do), ponder 
the lack of a &#8216;precise structural <i>mechanism</i>&#8217; to &#8216;connect&#8217; the base and 
the superstructure, and meditate on the ways in which this omission can be 
conceptually repaired.<a href="#n166" name="fn166" target="_self">[166]</a> But 
what is wrong, and was always wrong, is the analogy we start with (body-soul), 
and the notion that the joint can be mended with a &#8216;mechanism.&#8217; Socialist 
feminists, who have a genuine grudge against the &#8216;silences' of Marxism, attempt 
by arduous exercises of theory to insert a new flywheel (reproduction of the 
labour force) into the orrery, hoping that its inertia will somehow miraculously 
motor all the variegated &#8216;development forms&#8217; of sexual repression and 
expression, familial modes and gender roles. But what is wrong is not that they 
have proposed the problem, but that they have reduced it to a pseudo-problem by 
attempting to insert it into a machine designed for its exclusion. And, at the 
same time, they have been tricked into dismantling their problem&#8217;s whole 
challenge and identity, and have subdued it to the same general blight.</p>

<p class="fst">A cloud no bigger than a man&#8217;s hand crosses the English Channel 
from Paris, and then, in an instant, the trees, the orchard, the hedgerows, the 
field of wheat, are black with locusts. When at length they rise to fly on to 
the next parish, the boughs are bared of all culture, the fields have been 
stripped of every green blade of human aspiration; and in those skeletal forms 
and that blackened landscape, theoretical practice announces its &#8216;discovery&#8217;: 
the mode of production. Not only substantive knowledge, but also the very 
vocabularies of the human project - compassion, greed, love, pride, 
self-sacrifice, loyalty, treason, calumny - have been eaten down to the circuits 
of capital. These locusts are very learned platonists: if they setded on <i>The 
Republic</i> they would leave it picked clean of all but the idea of a 
contradiction between a philosopher and a slave. However elaborated the inner 
mechanisms, torsions, and autonomies, theoretical practice constitutes the 
ultimate in reductionism: a reduction, not of &#8216;religion&#8217; or &#8216;politics&#8217; to 
&#8216;economics&#8217;, but of the disciplines of knowledge to one kind of &#8216;basic&#8217; Theory 
only. Theory is for ever collapsing back into ulterior theory. In disallowing 
empirical enquiry, the mind is confined forever within the compound of the mind. 
It cannot walk abroad. It is struck down with theoretical cramp, and the pain is 
tolerable on condition that it does not move its limbs.</p>

<p class="fst">That, then, is the system of <i>closure.</i> It is the place 
where all <i>Marxisms,</i> conceived of as self-sufficient, self-validating, 
self-extrapolating theoretical systems, must end. At its worst (and this is 
where it is usually at) theoretical practice <i>is</i> the end, and we may thank 
Althusser for demonstrating this with such &#8216;rigour.&#8217; But if we return to 
&#8216;experience&#8217; we can move, from that point, once again into an <i>open</i> 
exploration of the world and of ourselves. This exploration makes demands of 
equal theoretical rigour, but within that dialogue of conceptualisation and 
empirical engagement which we have already examined (pp. 53-4). This exploration 
may still be within the Marxist tradition, in the sense that we are taking 
Marx&#8217;s hypotheses and some of his central concepts, and setting these to work. 
But the end of this exploration is not to discover a (reformed) finite 
conceptual system, Marx<i>ism</i>. There is and can never be such a finite 
system.</p>

<p class="fst">I am sorry to disappoint those practitioners who suppose that all 
that it is necessary to know about history can be constructed from a conceptual 
meccano set. One can only return, in the end, from these explorations with 
better methods and a better map; with a certain sense of the whole social 
process; with expectations as to process and as to structured relationships; 
with a certain way of situating oneself before the materials; with certain key 
concepts (themselves to be employed and tested and reformed) of historical 
materialism: class, ideology, mode of production. On the margins of the map we 
will always meet the boundaries of the unknown. What remains to be done is to 
interrogate the real silences, through the dialogue of knowledge; and as these 
silences are penetrated, we do not just sew up one new concept to the old 
fabric, we find it is necessary to re-order the whole <i>set</i> of concepts. 
There is no innermost altar that is sacrosanct against interrogation and 
revision.</p>

<p class="fst">Here lies the difference between Marxism and the Marxist 
tradition. It is possible to practise as a Marxist but to regard Marxisms to be 
obscuranticisms - as, manifestly, in a dozen forms, they have become. This has 
nothing to do with one&#8217;s admiration for Marx and his work. On the contrary, to 
admire that work is to place oneself as apprentice to it, to employ its terms, 
to learn to work in a dialogue of the same kind. But emulation should never rest 
upon literal-minded reverence - not even (as with Althusser) pretended reverence 
for what Marx intended to say but, unaccountably, forgot. It must arise from an 
understanding of the provisional and exploratory nature of all theory, and the 
openness with which one must approach all knowledge. This must also entail a 
respect for the continuity of intellectual culture, which is not to be seen as 
fractured into two halves, between the B.C. and A.D. of Marx&#8217;s &#8216;epistomological 
break&#8217;, and in which all other minds and knowledges are to be measured against 
the rule of Marxist Science.</p>

<p class="fst">It is the very notion of Marxism as &#8216;Science&#8217; that we find the 
authentic trade-mark of obscuranticism, and of an obscuranticism borrowed, like 
so much else, from a bourgeois ideology of great longevity. Utilitarians, 
Malthusians, Positivists, Fabians, and structural-functionalists, all suppose 
(d) themselves to be practising a &#8216;science&#8217;, and the most unabashed academic 
centre of brutalised capitalist ideology in contemporary England acclaims itself 
as a School of Economics and Political <i>Science.</i> When Marx and Engels 
claimed that they were applying scientific methods to the study of society, the 
claim may, on occasion, be upheld; when they supposed that they were founding a 
Science (Marxism) they were locking prison-gates upon their own knowledge.</p>

<p class="fst">The matter is now more grave than that. Marxzsm has for decades 
been suffering from a wasting disease of vulgar economism. Its motions have been 
enfeebled, its memory failing, its vision obscured. Now it has swiftly passed 
into a last delirium of idealism, and the illness must prove terminal. 
Theoretical practice is, already, the <i>rigor mortis</i> of <i>Marxism</i> 
setting in. Mar<i>xism</i> no longer has anything to tell us of the world, nor 
any way of finding out.</p>

<p class="fst">The impulse is to fly for our reason from this scene of 
devastation. Honourable men, like Cornelius Castoriadis, who have not abandoned 
for an instant their engagement with capitalism, have left the Marxist tradition 
in this way: they see it as irreparable, inherently elitist, dominative and 
anti-democratic (the &#8216;scientists&#8217; and the vulgar rest), and condemned by its 
orthodox and Stalinist fruits.<a href="#n167" name="fn167" target="_self">[167]</a> 
And I go with their critique a good part of the way (a salute, old comrades of <i>
Socialisme ou Barbaric</i>!): some part I have stated in my own terms. But even 
in their bitter polemic with &#8216;Marxism&#8217; we see that they are employing - and 
putting to better use - concepts which they first learned from Marx. For <i>
Marxisms</i> and the tradition of open, empirical enquiry, originating in the 
work of Marx, and employing, developing, and revising his concepts, have never 
been the same thing.</p>

<p class="fst">So, then, why fight over a name? For a Mar <i>xism</i> I would 
not fight, for I would fight with a guilty conscience. Marx was often wrong, and 
sometimes wrong in damaging ways. Not all Althusser&#8217;s licences of authority are 
as spurious as his sentence from <i>The Poverty of Philosophy.</i> Some part of 
Marx points towards a system and &#8216;science&#8217; in ways which afford uncomfortable 
continuities to the isms and State ideologies of our time. The <i>&#8216;Grundisse</i> 
face&#8217; of Marx, the notion of capital&#8217;s &#8216;immanence&#8217;, affords a premonition of 
Althusser, although these premonitions are plainly contradicted in a hundred 
other places. Marx shares with other great and fertile thinkers (Hobbes, 
Machiavelli, Milton, Pascal, Vico, Rousseau) an ambiguity inherent in the very 
vigour and openness of their thought. In taking us across a threshold, he leaves 
us at a door; we leave old problems behind, and we gain, exactly, a perspective 
upon the further range of problems ahead, some of which he could see, but few of 
which he could (in anticipation) solve. He places us is a new theoretical space, 
from which alternative developments lead forward. One name for this space is 
ambiguity, another is possibility. The very diversity of schools of thought 
which all claim a common Marxist inheritance (and all of which can produce 
difference licences of authority) is proof of that.</p>

<p class="fst">Marxism has been one possible development, although one with only 
an attentuated relationship to Marx. But the open, exploratory, self-critical 
Marxist tradition has been another development altogether. Its presence can be 
found in every discipline, in many political practices, and in every part of the 
world.</p>

<p class="fst">I had intended, at this point, to insert some comments upon a 
Marxist tradition which I know well - that of historiography. But I will reserve 
these notes for another place.<a href="#n168" name="fn168" target="_self">[168]</a>1 
don&#8217;t wish to personalise what is a very severe and general intellectual crisis, 
nor to allow it to be supposed that I am placing some &#8216;Anglo-Marxist tradition&#8217; 
against the &#8216;Franco-Marxism&#8217; of Althusser. The first tradition is not 
Anglo-Saxon: it is vigorous, not only in Scotland and Wales, but in France and 
in India, in Italy and (as, for example, in the tenacious tradition of <i>
Monthly Review</i>) in the United States: nor is it, in any sense, confined to 
historiography. The second ism is not representative of the best French 
socialist thought, and is only one extreme systematisation of systems which are 
found as state ideologies or within &#8216;Western Marxism.&#8217; Nor do I have any 
authority to speak for my fellow historians in the British Marxist tradition.</p>

<p class="fst">I will therefore simply indicate this as one location for an 
alternative tradition. And make one comment. Those who suppose (and these 
include half the <i>lumpen-intelligentsia</i> of Oxbridge) that Althusser and 
his colleagues were making some novel and &#8216;flexible&#8217; reappraisals of the Marxist 
&#8216;problematic&#8217; when they gestured at &#8216;relative autonomy&#8217; and &#8216;in the last 
instance&#8217; - and that before this &#8216;revolution&#8217; all practising Marxists were 
subdued to vulgar dogma or dumb &#8216;empiricism&#8217; - these people are simply 
disclosing their ignorance of historical and cultural materialism. In parti 
cular, their knowledge of history can only have been gathered from travellers&#8221; 
tales; and from such travellers as &#8216;Sir John Mandeville&#8217;, the good burgher of 
Liege, who never left his notary&#8217;s office.</p>

<p class="fst">&#8216;Relative autonomy&#8217; was where we started from, and we started 
with the aid of others who had started therefore before us. It would, after all, 
have been somewhat difficult for us to have examined the drama of Aeschylus, 
ancient Greek science, the origins of Buddhism, the city-state, Cistercian 
monasteries, utopian thought, Puritan doctrines, feudal tenures, the poetry of 
Marvell, Methodist revivalism,the symbolism of Tyburn, <i>grandes peurs</i> and 
riots, Behmenist sects, primitive rebels, economic and imperialist ideologies, 
and every type of class confrontation, negotiation and refraction, without, 
somewhere along the line, stumbling upon a difficulty. I do not claim that &quot;we&#8217; 
have done all this expertly, definitively, or even well. My concern is a 
different one; it is to emphasise that we entered, through historical 
experience, direcdy into the real silences of Marx.</p>

<p class="fst">What did we find? Not, I fear, a better Theory (historical 
materialist as a new closed <i>ism</i>). We found some new knowledge, we 
developed our own methods and the discourse of our discipline, and we advanced 
towards a common understanding of the full historical process. What else we 
discovered is more controversial, and I can only report my own sense of this. We 
confirmed all of those late warnings of Engels: it is impossible to move, by the 
change of a letter, from the capitalist mode of production to capitalism as a 
social formation. We explored, both in theory and in practice, those 
junction-concepts (such as &#8216;need&#8217;, &#8216;class&#8217;, and &#8216;determine&#8217;) by which, through 
the missing term, &#8216;experience&#8217;, structure is transmuted into process, and the 
subject re-enters into history. We greatly enlarged the concept of class, which 
historians in the Marxist tradition commonly employ - deliberately and not out 
of some theoretical &#8216;innocence&#8217; - with a flexibility and indeterminacy 
disallowed both by Marxism and by orthodox sociology. And at &#8216;experience&#8217; we 
were led on to re-examine all those dense, complex and elaborated systems by 
which familial and social life is structured and social consciousness finds 
realisation and expression (systems which the very rigour of the discipline in 
Ricardo or in the Marx of <i>Capital</i> is designed to exclude): kinship, 
custom, the invisible and visible rules of social regulation, hegemony and 
deference, symbolic forms of domination and of resistance, religious faith and 
millenarial impulses, manners, law, institutions and ideologies - all of which, 
in their sum, comprise the &#8216;genetics&#8217; of the whole historical process, all of 
them jointed, at a certain point, in common human experience, which itself (as 
distinctive <i>class</i> experiences) exerts its pressure on the sum.</p>

<p class="fst">When I say that &#8216;we&#8217; explored outwards in this way, I don&#8217;t mean 
that we were the first-comers, or that we were unaided by historians, 
anthropologists and others in different traditions. Our debts are manifold. But, 
in my view, we did not discover other, and co-existent, <i>systems</i>, of equal 
status and coherence to the system of (anti) Political Economy, exerting 
co-equal determining pressures: a Kinship Mode, a Symbolic Mode, an Ideological 
Mode, etc. &#8216;Experience&#8217; (we have found) has, in the last instance, been 
generated in &#8216;material life&#8217;, has been structured in class ways, and hence 
&#8216;social being&#8217; has determined &#8216;social consciousness.&#8217; <i>La Structure</i> still 
dominates experience but from that point her determinate influence is weak. For 
any living generation, in any &#8216;now&#8217;, the ways in which they &#8216;handle&#8217; experience 
defies prediction and escapes from any narrow definition of determination.</p>

<p class="fst">I think that we have found out something else, of even greater 
significance for the whole project of socialism. For I introduced, a few pages 
back, another necessary middle term: &#8216;culture.&#8217; And we find that, with 
&#8216;experience&#8217; and &#8216;culture&#8217; we are at a junction-point of another kind. For 
people do not only experience their own experience as ideas, within thought and 
its procedures, or (as some theoretical practitioners suppose) as proletarian 
instinct, etc. They also experience their own experience as <i>feeling</i>, and 
they handle their feelings within their culture, as norms, familial and kinship 
obligations and reciprocities, as values or (through more elaborated forms) 
within art or religious beliefs. This half of culture (and it is a full 
one-half) may be described as affective and moral consciousness.</p>

<p class="fst">This is, exactly, <i>not</i> to argue that &#8216;morality&#8217; is some 
&#8216;autonomous region&#8217; of human choice and will, arising independently of the 
historical process. Such a view of morality has never been materialist enough, 
and hence it has often reduced that formidable inertia - and sometimes 
formidable revolutionary force - into a wishful idealist fiction. It is to say, 
on the contrary, that every contradiction is a conflict of value as well as a 
conflict of interest; that inside every &#8216;need&#8217; there is an affect, or &#8216;want&#8217;, on 
its way to becoming an &#8216;ought&#8217; (and <i>vice versa);</i> that every class 
struggle is at the same time a struggle over values; and that the project of 
Socialism is guaranteed <i>by nothing</i> - certainly not by &#8216;Science&#8217;, or by 
Marxism-Leninism - but can find its own guarantees only by <i>reason</i> and 
through an open <i>choice of values.</i></p>

<p class="fst">And it is here that the silence of Marx, and of most Marxisms, is 
so loud as to be deafening. It is an odd silence, to be sure, since as we have 
already noted (p. 78), Marx, in his wrath and compassion, was a moralist in 
every stroke of his pen. Besieged by the triumphant moralism of Victorian 
capitalism, whose rhetoric concealed the actualities of exploitation and 
imperialism, his polemical device was to expose all moralism as a sick deceit: 
&#8216;the English Established Church will more readily pardon an attack on 38 of its 
39 articles than on 1/39th of its income.&#8217; His stance became that of an 
anti-moralist. This was true, in equal degree, of Engels, whose inadequate 
arguments in <i>Anti-Dühring</i> I do not mean to examine. By the 1880s, 
Engels&#8217;s overt distaste for moralism was such that he looked straight through 
the extraordinary genius of Morris, and failed even to notice what was there.</p>

<p class="fst">To the end of his life, when confronting, in his anthropological 
researches, problems manifestly demanding analysis in terms not derivative from 
Political Economy, Marx - while acknowledging the problems - was always trying 
to shove them back into an economic frame of reference. When Maine referred to 
&#8216;the mass of influences, which we may call for shortness moral&#8217;, Marx 
impatiently annotated the text: &#8216;This &#8220;moral&#8221; shows how little Maine understand 
of the matter; as far as these influences (economical before everything else) 
possess a &#8220;&#8217;moral&#8221; modus of existence, this is always a derived, secondary modus 
and never the prius.&#8217;<a href="#n169" name="fn169" target="_self">[169]</a> But 
this is not any analysis: it is simply a refusal to break a silence. If the 
&#8216;moral&#8217; influences exist as a moral &#8216;modus&#8217; then they exist and must be analysed 
in a vocabulary of norms, values, obligations, expectations, taboos, etc. That 
they are &#8216;economical before everything else&#8217; and are &#8216;derived, secondary&#8217; is a 
pre-judgement, or, more politely, an hypothesis, which nowhere in Marx&#8217;s work is 
fully examined, which his major project excludes from consideration, and which, 
in its turn, is derived from a particular and limited definition of the 
&#8216;economic.&#8217; In this whole area Morris was immensely more perceptive than Engels 
or Marx.</p>

<p class="fst">This silence was transmitted to the subsequent Marxist tradition 
in the form of a repression. This repression, in its turn, made it more easy for 
the major tradition to turn its back upon Morris (and many other voices) and to 
capitulate to an economism which, in fact, simply took over a bourgeois 
utilitarian notion of &#8216;need&#8217;; and, as a necessary complement to this, to foster 
a paltry philistinism towards the arts. It was only necessary for Marxist 
Science to enter into the kingdom of Socialism, and all else would be added 
thereunto. And Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism did. And we know with what results.</p>

<p class="fst">That is a crassly over-simplified account of a more complex, and 
more contested, development. But we have now tracked the last of Althusser&#8217;s 
ogres, &#8216;moralism&#8217;, to its lair. Its lair is found to be, less in the forest of 
bourgeois ideology, than deep in the heart of the international working-class 
movement itself. This ogre has given to that movement a utopian nerve of 
aspiration, the muscles of solidarity, and, on occasion, the courage of 
revolutionary self-sacrifice. It has also, on repeated occasions, impelled 
revolts and defections within Communist Parties, and a running polemic against 
the practices of those Parties and the moral vacancy of the Marxist vocabulary. 
In 1956 it assumed the proportions of a mass revulsion within the international 
Communist movement against Stalinist practices and apologetics; its most 
articulate spokesmen (the ogres incarnate) were very often poets and novelists: 
Tuwim, Wazyk, Pasternak, Dery, Illyes, Solzhenitsyn. Once again, so far from 
Althusser advancing a critique of Stalinism, he is engaged in an ideological 
police-action against that critique, by attempting to disallow the most 
important terms in which that critique has been made.</p>

<p class="fst">In this case, and in this case only, the license of authority 
which Althusser produces is authentic. It is, indeed, signed by Marx and 
countersigned (with a caveat as to &#8216;truly human morality&#8217;) by Engels. This is, 
perhaps, why Althusser never bothers to argue the case, but can simply assume 
that all Marxists must agree that &#8216;moralism&#8217; is a hideous enormity. What he has 
to say about &#8216;moralism&#8217; is rarely specific. In <i>For Marx</i> and <i>Reading 
Capital</i> the problem&#8217;s presence is to be noted mainly in the careful 
strategies employed to ensure its absence from the text. On the one hand, all 
questions of norms, affective relationships and rules, are dismissed in the same 
gesture that dismisses &#8216;anthropology&#8217; (p. 196). This enables him (and all 
theoretical practitioners) to set aside unread fifty years of work in social 
history, anthropology, and adjacent disciplines, some of it by Marxist 
practitioners, and all of it enlightening the problem of &#8216;relative autonomy&#8217; 
which is supposedly an object of Althusser&#8217;s rigorous labours.</p>

<p class="fst">On the other hand, &#8216;morality&#8217; is simply equated to &#8216;bourgeois 
morality&#8217;: i.e. ideology. This is a &#8216;world of alibis, sublimations and lies&#8217;, 
or, with &#8216;politics and religion&#8217;, a world of &#8216;myths and drugs&#8217; (<i>EM.</i> 140, 
145), and Marxists can have no interest in it except to demystify it. 
&#8216;Moralism&#8217;, or &#8216;the recourse of ethics&#8217;, is the shadow of &#8216;humanism&#8217;, whose 
function (we remember) is to offer &#8216;an imaginary treatment of real problems.&#8217; 
Old comrades will certainly recognise this invincible Stalinist formula - 
pronounced on every uncomfortable occasion by every Party hack: true morality 
equals whatever furthers the best interests of the working class: the Party, 
guided by Marxist &#8216;science&#8217;, is best able to decide what those best interests 
are (and how lucky the working lass is to have Daddy to do that!): and since 
what are at issue are <i>interests,</i> which can be determined with the 
precision of science, no choice of values (or of means) can be involved. When it 
was decided that, after his death, by the Party, that Stalin was in some points 
wrong, no question of Stalinism&#8217;s moral stench was involved - an investigation 
of <i>that</i> might have brought even Marxism and the Party under suspicion. 
The vocabulary permitted only &#8216;errors&#8217; and 'mistakes&#8217; (misjudgement of best 
interests) to be allowed. That, after some years, the decidedly-unscientific 
term, &#8216;crimes&#8217;, has now been allowed may be attributed, not to revisionism, but 
to an opportunist reflex in the face of the accusing moral sensibility of the 
millions.</p>

<p class="fst">There is something more in Althusser&#8217;s subsequent essay on 
&#8216;Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses&#8217; (<i>L.&amp; R</i> pp. 123-173). This 
is, perhaps, the ugliest thing he has ever done, the crisis of the idealist 
delirium. I will spare myself the tedium of criticism, since in its naivety, its 
refusal of all relevant evidence, and its absurd idealist inventions, it exposes 
itself. &#8216;Ethics&#8217;, etc., are offered as an ideological State apparatus (and only 
as that), imposed upon the innocent and utterly passive, recipient, man, by 
means of &#8216;the family State apparatus&#8217; and &#8216;the educational State apparatus.&#8217; 
This ideology imposes upon individuals &#8216;the imaginary relationships ... to their 
real conditions of existence.&#8217; And to explain how it does this, Althusser 
invents a (wholly imaginary) device of &#8216;interpellation&#8217; or &#8216;hailing&#8217;, by which 
the State via its ideological apparatus (&#8216;religious, ethical, legal, political, 
aesthetic, etc.&#8217;!) cries out to individuals: &#8216;Ahoy, there!&#8217; It is only necessary 
for the State to hail them, and they are &#8216;recruited&#8217; instantly to whatever 
&#8216;imaginary relationship&#8217; the State requires. Hailing has always gone one, and it 
always will, in any society. This is so, not because people cannot live and 
sustain relationships without values and norms, but because &#8216;ideology ... is 
indispensable in any society if men are to <i>be formed,;,</i> transformed and 
equipped' to respond to the demands of their conditions of existence.' (<i>F.M.</i> 
235) (Notice, once again, the passive, transitive form, the reification of 
agency by the Other.) By means of &#8216;interpellation&#8217;, or hailing, men and women 
are constituted (within ideology) as (imaginary) subjects: for example, as 
Jeunes fitudiants Catholiques or as Ulster Protestants.</p>

<p class="fst">It is a touching scenario, and one which could only have been 
written by a gentleman who has lived a retired life. It suggests a future for 
its author as a script-writer for &#8216;Watch with Mother.&#8217; The wicked witch of State 
appears! The wand of ideology is flourished! And, hey presto! Not only has the 
prince become a frog, but the entire coach-and-six of the reformist trade union 
movement (another &#8216;ideological State apparatus&#8217;) has become a match-box drawn by 
six white mice. But if any readers in this country have been imposed upon (or 
&#8216;interpellated&#8217;) by the loud-hailing of the several British import agencies for 
&#8216;Western Marxism' (including <i>helas</i>, one heavy import agency which, some 
years ago, I had a part in founding) to suppose that this is the best that the 
Marxist tradition in France can do with sociology, communications and 
educational theory, etc., then I beg them to be disabused. They might commence 
their reeducation by attending to Pierre Bourdieu.</p>

<p class="fst">What is obvious about these tormented constructions is that they 
are the desperate devices employed by a naive rationalism in an attempt to trick 
up a new rationalist explanation for non-rational behaviour: that is, the 
affective and moral consciousness must somehow be construed as displaced 
rationality (&#8216;ideology&#8217;) and not as <i>lived experience</i> &#8216;handled&#8217; in 
distinctive ways. (Althusser might at least have learned from Merleau-Ponty that 
consciousness is <i>lived</i> as much as it is <i>known.)</i><a href="#n170" name="fn170" target="_self">[170]</a> 
These devices can, as always, boast formidable credentials within bourgeois 
ideology. The &#8216;value&#8217;/Tacf antinomy, in which &#8216;value&#8217; or &#8216;morality&#8217; is 
supposedly an autonomous area of choice resting upon the de-socialised 
individual, has continually reappeared as its <i>alter ego:</i> the eviction of 
value from social and economic &#8216;science&#8217;, the segregation of &#8216;morality&#8217; within 
the pailisades of &#8216;the personal&#8217; - a socialiy-ineffectual space of private 
preferences. (We are permitted, today, to have &#8216;moral&#8217; preferences about sexual 
conduct, but the questions of economic &#8216;growth&#8217; are scientific matters in which 
no choices of value are entailed.) The good old utilitarian notion that all 
facts are quantifiable and measurable (and hence can be ingested by a computer), 
and that whatever is not measurable is not a fact, is alive and kicking and in 
possession of a large part of the Marxist tradition. And yet, what cannot be 
measured has had some very measurable material consequences.</p>

<p class="fst">This may explain why theoretical practitioners refuse to admit 
historical evidence to their seminars on &#8216;moralism&#8217; and &#8216;ideology&#8217;. Historians 
would very soon have to point out that all that was being done was to invent for 
utilitarianism a new set of idealist credentials. Values are neither &#8216;thought&#8217; 
nor &#8216;hailed&#8217;; they are lived, and they arise within the same nexus of material 
life and material relations as do our ideas. They are the necessary norms, 
rules, expectations, &amp;c, learned (and &#8216;learned&#8217; within feeling) within the &#8216;<i>habitus&#8217;</i> 
of living; and learned, in the first place, within the family, at work, and 
within the immediate community. Without this learning social life could not be 
sustained, and all production would cease.</p>

<p class="fst">This is not to say that values are independent of the colouration 
of ideology; manifestly this is not the case, nor how, when experience itself is 
structured in class ways, could this be so? But to suppose from this that they 
are &#8216;imposed&#8217; (by a State!) as &#8216;ideology&#8217; is to mistake the whole social and 
cultural process. This imposition will always be attempted, with greater or less 
success, but it cannot succeed at all unless there is some <i>congruence</i> 
between the imposed rules and view-of-life and the necessary business of living 
a given mode of production. Moreover, values no less than material needs will 
always be a locus of <i>contradiction</i>, of struggle between alternative 
values and views-of-life. If we say that values are learned within lived 
experience and are subject to its determinations, we need not therefore 
surrender to a moral or cultural relativism. Nor need we suppose some 
uncrossable barrier between value and reason. Men and women argue about values, 
they choose between values, and in their choosing they adduce rational evidence 
and interrogate their own values by rational means. This is to say that they are <i>
as much but no more</i> determined in their values as in their ideas and 
actions, they are <i>as much but no more</i> &#8216;subjects&#8217; of their own affective 
and moral consciousness as of their general history. Conflicts of value, and 
choices of value, always take place. When a person joins or crosses a 
picket-line, that person is making a choice of values, even if the terms of the 
choice and some part of what that person chooses <i>with</i> are socially and 
culturally determined.</p>

<p class="fst">Historical and cultural materialism cannot explain &#8216;morality&#8217; 
away as class interests in fancy dress, since the notion that all &#8216;interests&#8217; 
can be subsumed in scientifically-determinable material objectives is nothing 
more than utilitarianism&#8217;s bad breath. Interests are what interest people, 
including what interests them nearest to the heart. A materialist examination of 
values must situate itself, not by idealist propositions, but in the face of 
culture&#8217;s material abode: the people&#8217;s way of life, and, above all, their 
product and familial relationships. And this is what &#8216;we&#8217; have been doing, and 
over many decades.</p>

<p class="fst">Althusserian notions of &#8216;ideology&#8217; have the quaintness of an 
antique, a piece of ornate rationalist Victoriana. We have examined the 
value-systems of peasantries, of the patriarchal household, the acquisitive 
values of insurgent capitalism (and the intense struggles around these), the 
values of foresters, yeomen, artisans, handloom-weavers, factory workers. We 
have examined these as a locus of conflict, at inarticulate, sub-articulate, 
sublimated, and at complex and arduously-contested levels of articulacy, (what 
else is <i>The Country and the City</i> about?). For the affective and moral 
consciousness discloses itself within history, and within class struggles, 
sometimes as a scarcely-articulate inertia (custom, superstition), sometimes as 
an articulate conflict between alternative, class-based value-systems (the 
&#8216;moral economy&#8217; of the crowd, the confrontation around the 1834 Poor Law), 
sometimes as a displaced, confused, but none-the-less 'real&#8217; and passionate 
encounter within religious forms (Methodism, millenarianism), sometimes as the 
brutal imposition by Church or State of a &#8216;moralism&#8217; (the sanctified burning of 
heretics, sanctified Stalinist State &#8216;trials&#8217;), and sometimes as one of the most 
rigorous and complex disciplines known within intellectual culture - the full 
disclosure of values, and the rational argument between values, exemplified in 
literature and in a certain kind of disciplined moral critique.</p>

<p class="fst">All this will not go away because it is defined out of our 
Theory. I can only suppose, from certain references of theoretical practitioners 
to &#8216;moralism&#8217;, that these imagine a moral choice, or a choice between values, to 
be a kind of grunt, and a grunt which is the reflex of &#8216;ideology&#8217;; and that they 
suppose that one grunt is as good as any other, and have never noticed that it 
may take the form of a discipline with its own arduous and relevant &#8216;discourse 
of the proof/ There are, of course, rotten &#8216;moralisms&#8217; just as there are rotten 
ideologies and philosophies (we have been examining one). And in so far as the 
full disclosure of choices between values is inhibited, in so far as the 
articulate &#8216;discourse of the proof&#8217; is actively suppressed, so any 
value-informed view of life will rot away into rhetoric and hypocritical 
moralistic oratory. This is, exactly, the case with Stalinism; this is, exactly, 
why Stalinism has always most distrusted poets; this is, exactly, why the 
intellectual apologists for Stalinism have always sought to block off any 
possible moral critique; and this is, exactly, why one form of the protest 
against Stalinist ideology and forms has very often been &#8216;moralistic&#8217;, but, 
since it has been denied every opportunity for open articulation, it often 
appears as a kind of <i>displaced</i>, illusory, and, of necessity, &#8216;utopian&#8217; 
moralism - as a reversion to Greek Orthodox faith, as nationalist 
self-exclusion, as personalist selfisolation, or as Solzhenitsyn - as the 
agonised heartbeat within a heartless world. And so, we may confidently predict, 
the Soviet Union will continue to astonish us; ever more bizarre and immaterial 
forms of moral consciousness will arise as &#8216;superstructure&#8217; upon that 
severely-scientific material &#8216;base&#8217;. The Soviet repressive and ideological State 
apparatuses, in inhibiting any open argument about values, have not only denied 
to &#8216;individuals&#8217; the right of &#8216;self-expression&#8217;, they have denied to Soviet 
society the means to express, and to examine, itself.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus the moral critique of Stalinism has never been some grunt of 
moral autonomy. It has been a very specific and pracdcal political critique. It 
has concerned particular forms and practices within the international Communist 
movement; the subordination of the imagination (and of the artist) to the wisdom 
of the Party; the imposition of a notion of &#8216;political realism', which refuses 
any debate over values, at every level of the Party organisation; the 
economistic strategies and the narrow propaganda of material need, which is 
blind to whole areas of (sexual, cultural) need, which despises the people&#8217;s own 
cultural resources, and which assumes, but does not permit people to choose, 
what they really &#8216;want&#8217;. As a result, in its inhibition of all &#8216;utopianism&#8217;, and 
in its repression of the &#8216;education of desire&#8217;, it reproduces, within 
capitalism, the very reasons of capital - the utilitarian definition of &#8216;need&#8217; - 
and hence, in the very moment that it offers to struggle against its power, it 
inculcates obedience to its rules.'<a href="#n171" name="fn171" target="_self">[171]</a> 
Theoretical practice, in its spurious pretentions to be Science, is seeking to 
validate the bad faith of the Marxist tradition, and is reproducing as ideology 
the central vacancy of Stalinism.</p>

<p class="fst">It was the oldest error of rationalism to suppose that by 
defining the non-rational out of its vocabulary it had in some way defined it 
out of life. I rediscovered this, with a happy sense of recognition, in a recent 
debate on &#8216;moralism&#8217; in the pages of <i>Radical Philosophy</i>. The 
practitioners, who as yet are only apprentices to Theory, should not be scolded 
too much. But we move here, with solemnity, through three propositions. (1) All 
morality = ideology. Thus: for Marx, &#8216;morality was an historically specific 
ideological institution functioning to mystify and discipline people in 
accordance with the oppressive and exploitive needs of class society.&#8217;<a href="#n172" name="fn172" target="_self">[172]</a> 
(<i>Marx</i> certainly never said that; insofar as he afforded licence for some 
of that to be said, one can only say &#8216;alas!&#8217;, and recall how far his 
contemporary thought was saturated with the same rationalist illusions.) But the 
equation is derived, not only from Marx, but from &#8216;Historical Materialism&#8217; 
(whose products these authors have evidently found it unnecessary to consult). 
Marxist history, it seems, has demonstrated that &#8216;moral ideology has a socially 
repressive function.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Proposition (2). In contradistinction to &#8216;moral ideology&#8217; (which 
the ruling class inculcates for its own convenience) we are to suppose that &#8216;a 
form of practical reason is possible which is in no sense moral or socially 
repressive.&#8217; Mora) ideology &#8216;must be antagonistic to natural values (happiness, 
the satisfaction of wants).&#8217; Thus there are &#8216;naturalistic&#8217; imperatives (simple 
ones, like &#8216;happiness&#8217;) and these can be instantly deduced by &#8216;reason.&#8217; &#8216;The 
removal of moral motives would leave man ... to rationally pursue his 
naturalistic ends.&#8217; This, apart from leaving the reason inside a split 
infinitive, would leave no other problems:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Practical reason of a non-moral kind involves understanding 
one&#8217;s own needs, developing them in such a way that their most satisfying form 
of satisfaction is possible, gaining knowledge and therefore power over the 
world, selecting the best means for the satisfaction of needs, etc.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">But - a shadow passes across this sunlit field at the 
recollection of the possible egotism of <i>other</i> people which might 
interfere with &#8216;one&#8217; satisfying one&#8217;s needs satisfactorily - this &#8216;practical 
reason&#8217; must &#8216;often be in the collective mode, i.e. the question will be not 
&#8220;what shall I do&#8221; but &#8220;what shall we do&#8217;, collective naturalistic self-interest 
being the ground for choice.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Our learned Theban, having disposed of this problem to his 
satisfaction, passes forward to proposition (3). A classless society will see 
the withering away of all morality. &#8216;The elimination of moral ideology is . . . 
taken as a rational desideratum.&#8217;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The classical position of Marxism on this subject is that 
morality as an autonomous form of practical reason would disappear with the 
abolition of class antagonisms.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Moreover, we can hasten that about living naturalistically now:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There is no moral basis for socialism, no such thing as 
&#8216;living as a socialist&#8217; within capitalist society, and no imperatives incumbent 
upon socialists as such other than that of working for socialism. How a 
socialist gets his money or his kicks is politically irrelevant.&#8221;<a href="#n173" name="fn173" target="_self">[173]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Proposition (1): Morality = Ideology. (2) But there are 
&#8216;naturalistic ends&#8217;, a &#8216;collective naturalistic self-interest&#8217;, which can be 
determined by reason. (3) Classless society will ensure the withering away of 
morality with a rider as to present-day money and kicks which (it is fair to 
note) one or two fellow practitioners disputed.<a href="#n174" name="fn174" target="_self">[174]</a> 
The rest, it seems, could be taken as the &#8216;classical position of Marxism&#8217;S 
Morality is a repressive mechanism for inhibiting the naturalistic libido.</p>

<p class="fst">&#8216;O, reason not the need .. . &#8217;! One might be pardoned for 
supposing that some apprentice practitioners have no more notion of the social 
formation (and clash) of values that night be afforded by recollections of nasty 
school rules and even nastier family quarrels. The &#8216;ideological State apparatus&#8217; 
(<i>sic!)</i> of the only family that ever appears in their writing is, indeed, 
hideously repressive:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In the monogamous nuclear family, however liberal, the child 
is at the mercy of her family, deprived of responsibility (determining agency) 
or choice of friends, and denied the opportunity for full, wide and many-sided 
relationships with peers and older people. Thus are reinforced the isolated, 
anxiety-ridden, competitive character structures of the bourgeoisie and as well, 
the tamed law-aspiring proletarian.&#8221;<a href="#n175" name="fn175" target="_self">[175]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The description is, perhaps, a touch moralistic (even priggish) - 
and, since &#8216;Marxism&#8217; (or Althusser) has demonstrated that the notion of 
&#8216;responsibility&#8217; (determining agency) in <i>adults</i> is a noxious humanist 
illusion, how is it that children do not come within the same theoretical 
provision?</p>

<p class="fst">Never mind. The quarrels (one might hazard) have been about such 
&#8216;naturalistic ends&#8217; as sex, money and pot. And this reminds us that the 
repudiation of all &#8216;moralism&#8217; has been very much the mode for some time. The 
revolting young bourgeosie have long been into doing their own things, and, if 
they are moralists at all, this comes out in their disapproval of all &#8216;heavy&#8217; 
speeches from their elders about &#8216;oughts.&#8217; The more sensitive among them have 
not only been <i>into</i> doing their own thing, they are already coming <i>out,</i> 
chastened, at the thing&#8217;s other side. They have discovered that to have &#8216;the 
most satisfying form of satisfaction&#8217; sometimes leaves the source of 
satisfaction as a heart-broken wreck; that egos must be socialised and humanised 
(or sat upon) if they are not to make each others&#8221; lives into a hell; that 
&#8216;happiness&#8217; does not come, like a dog, to the whistle of reason; that 
&#8216;socialists&#8217; who get their money and kicks in certain ways will also be 
somewhere else in any political emergency; and that even those monstrous 
apparatuses, the family and school, have one or two functions subsidiary to that 
of repression.</p>

<p class="fst">So - some of these revolting young bourgeois are doing O.K. They 
may yet take their parts in the socialist movement, while the others - the 
egotists who posture as &#8216;revolutionaries&#8217; as one of their &#8216;kicks&#8217; - will no 
doubt graduate as vigilant headmasters and tyrannical papas. (I&#8217;ve seen all 
this, not only in my own empiricist &#8216;experience&#8217;, but also, repeatedly, in 
historical research.) Very soon the best of them will turn away from exclusive 
moral scrutiny of their own inter-personal affairs, and take a larger view of 
society. And there they will discover the same logic writ out at large. &#8216;Gaining 
knowledge and therefore power over the world&#8217; will, for the unconstrained 
egotist, mean getting other people within his power. The reasons of Reason, 
unencumbered by the moral consciousness, become, very soon, the reasons of 
interest, and then the reasons of State, and thence, in an uncontested 
progression, the rationalisations of opportunism, brutality, and crime.</p>

<p class="fst">There is not, nor can there ever be, any &#8216;naturalistic&#8217; morality, 
any &#8216;naturalistic ends.&#8217; Certainly, historical and cultural materialism have 
never found them. Ends are chosen by our culture, which afford us, at the same 
time, our own medium of choosing and of influencing that choice. To suppose 
otherwise is to suppose that our &#8216;needs&#8217; are <i>there</i>, somewhere outside of 
ourselves and our culture, and that, if only ideology would go.</p>

<p class="fst">And this, of course, is the moment of recognition. For we have 
gone back, in one swift step, to one of the dottiest moments in the 
Enlightenment. The &#8216;naturalistic ends&#8217; were given, in a rational way, as 
self-interest by Adam Smith, but it was left to Bentham to invent a means of 
determining these needs &#8216;in such a way that their most satisfying form of 
satisfaction is possible&#8217; - the Felicific Calculus. And the notion of&#8216;the 
collective naturalistic self-interest&#8217; was proposed, in a rational way, by 
Rousseau and others (the general will, the common good); but it was left to 
William Godwin to ascend, by the spiral of Hartleyan associationist psychology, 
from self-interest to &#8216;benevolence&#8217; - from which lofty height the enthroned 
Reason could see through all the spurious ideological bonds of sentiment - 
gratitude, love of kin, the family, the servitude of the irrational crowd:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;This was the time, when all things tending fast<br>
To depravation, the Philisophy<br>
That promised to abstract the hopes of man<br>
Out of his feelings, to be fix&#8217;d thenceforth<br>
For ever in a purer element<br>
Found ready welcome. Tempting region that<br>
For Zeal to enter and refresh herself,<br>
Where passions had the privilege to work And never hear the sound of their own 
names;<br>
But, speaking more in charity, the dream<br>
Was flattering to the young ingenuous 
mind Pleas&#8217;d with extremes, and not the least with that<br>
Which makes the human 
Reason&#8217;s naked self The object of its fervour. What delight!<br>
How glorious! in self-knowledge and self-rule,<br>

And, with resolute mastery shaking off The accidents of nature, time, and place,<br>

The freedom of the individual mind,<br>
Which, to the blind restraints of general laws Superior, magisterially adopts<br>
One guide, the light of circumstances, flash&#8217;d Upon an independent intellect.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This great passage from a great work, <i>The Prelude</i>, reminds 
us that the mind has walked these cliffs before. It is itself - when taken in 
its full context - exemplary of that argument of values, that disciplined 
'discourse of the proof&#8217; to which I have referred. Marxism also has offered 
often to &#8216;abstract the hopes of man/Out of his feelings&#8217;, and to fix them in the 
purer element of &#8216;science.&#8217; And Stalinism was the empire, and theoretical 
practice is the vocabulary (with &#8216;moralism&#8217;, &#8216;humanism&#8217;, and human agency 
expelled from it in ignominy) -</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Where passions had the privilege to work<br>
And never hear the sound of their own names.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">And Godwinism itself, which freaked out half the young 
intelligentsia in England between 1794 and 1798, was exactly such a moment of 
intellectual extremism, divorced from correlative action or actual social 
commitment, as we have seen in the last decade.</p>

<p class="fst">So, if we shift a digit around (1798/1978), we are in the same 
synchronic moment of structured time. But. . . the second time as farce. For 
those Godwinians, in the only moment when the English intelligentsia adopted, in 
their theory, an ultra-Jacobin posture, had some spirit about them. They 
questioned everything. They questioned Reason itself. Seconded by Wollstonecraft 
(who came less from a rationalist than from a Dissenting and Romantic tradition) 
they made the institution of marriage spin. They frightened everyone. They 
frightened, above all, themselves. Theoretical practice, however, can lay claim 
to only one achievement in this country. It has frightened Mr Julius Gould, who, 
in such matters, is well known to be an uncommonly nervous fellow. For the rest, 
it has been a diversion, a retreat into the privacy of a complacent internal 
discourse, a disengagement from the actual political and intellectual contests 
of our time.</p>

<p class="fst">As for the Godwinian moment, and its tragic aftermath, I hope to 
tell that story another time.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h16">xvi</a></h3>

<p class="fst">We left our &#8216;post-Stalinist&#8217; reader, many pages back, enquiring: 
&#8216;Well? Did you identify the sources of Stalinism? Did you construct a better 
Theory?&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">I hope that the answer to both questions has now become clear. 
Stalinism appeared to us, in those old days, less as a coherent theoretical 
system than as a mish-mash of repressive practices, dominative modes, 
hypocritical rhetoric, &#8216;wrong theories&#8217;, Leninist forms and tactics derived from 
the necessities of illegal agitation and turned into universalist axioms, and 
all this bound together within the short-sighted opportunism of the reasons of 
Soviet State power. Stalinism as high Theory did not precede but followed after 
the fact.</p>

<p class="fst">If we wished to translate its practices into a consistent 
theoretical system, then we would design a Theory in which close empirical 
analysis of its practices was, as a matter of epistemological principle, 
disallowed (&quot;empiricism&#8217;); in which any moral critique was utterly prohibited 
(&#8216;moralism&#8217;); in which the universal validity of Leninist forms (but of forms in 
an advanced state of bureaucratic degeneration) was assumed without examination 
(the characteristic theoretical short-circuit, the proletariat = the Party); in 
which a structuralist reductionism both guaranteed the fundamental health of the 
Soviet system in its supposedly socialist economic &#8216;basis&#8217; (thereby displacing 
all political, legal and cultural questions into secondary or tertiary areas) 
and disallowed any materialist historical analysis of this system 
(&#8216;historicism&#8217;); in which men and women were seen as the bearers of ineluctable 
structural determinations, in which their responsibility and historical agency 
was denied (&#8216;humanism&#8217;), and in which it was, hence, more easy to view them as 
&#8216;rotten elements&#8217; or things; and all this united within a notion of Theory both 
as enclosure and as &#8216;science&#8217;, which Theory could be grasped in its essentials 
by the rigorous contemplation of texts written over one hundred years before the 
major historical experiences which it seeks to explain took place. In short, 
Althusserianism <i>is</i> Stalinism reduced to the paradigm of Theory. It is 
Stalinism at last, theorised as ideology.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus there is a sense in which we failed fully to identify 
Stalinism as Theory, because we were waiting upon Althusser for this theory to 
be invented. But we did, at least, identify essential components of this theory, 
in its characteristic idealist mode of thought (p. 192), and we never comforted 
ourselves with the apology that Stalinism represented only some unaccountable 
&#8216;rupture of theory and practice.&#8217;<a href="#n176" name="fn176" target="_self">[176]</a> 
Moreover, we saw, very clearly, that from its particular matrix in Soviet 
history, Stalinism had entered deeply within the theory, practices, strategies 
and forms of the international Communist movement; and, further, that the 
complicity of orthodox Marxism in funding Stalinism with its vocabulary of 
apologetics - in proving itself to be pliant enough to provide the elements for 
the State ideology of the Soviet bureaucracy - entailed the strong probability 
that Marxism itself stood in need of radical scrutiny, and that it would never 
be adequate to ravel it up again into a better <i>system.</i></p>

<p class="fst">This gave us an agenda, and it is hardly surprising that this 
agenda could not be completed in six or seven years - years of heightened 
political activity. This also gives an answer to the second question. It was 
exactly the notion of Marxism as a self-sufficient theoretical Sum which 
constituted the essence of the metaphysical heresy against reason, and which 
inhibited the active investigation of the world within the developing, 
provisional, and self-critical tradition of historical materialism. I have 
argued this sufficiently.</p>

<p class="fst">Althusserianism is only one, sophisticated, form of a number of 
&#8216;Marxisms&#8217; which pushed our unfinished agenda aside, and crowded into the minds 
of a section of the Western intelligentsia from the 1960s onwards. The case of 
Althusserianism is one of the simplest, since, as we have seen, it is a 
straightforward ideological police action. It constructs a theory which ensures 
not only that radical questions about Stalinism, Communist forms, and &#8216;Marxism&#8217; 
itself are not asked, but that they <i>cannot be asked.</i> If we take Althusser 
at his own self-evaluation - if we suppose him to be &#8216;innocent&#8217; - then we can 
only say that he has lost himself so far inside his own head that when he looks 
at the world he sees only the projection of his own concepts: the P.C.F. is 
embodied proletarian ideology, Stalinism in decomposition is &#8216;socialist 
humanism', the murder of a revolution&#8217;s cadres is the dictatorship of the 
proletariat, the substantial gains over decades of the Western working classes 
are an index of their more intense exploitation. In a certain sense we can be 
charitable; there is a logic in all this; mechanical materialism (&#8216;economism&#8217;) <i>
must</i>, when every evidence from the real world disproves its theories, when 
every socialist expectation is abjectly falsified, stop up its ears and eyes, 
and pass abruptly into the delirium of idealism.</p>

<p class="fst">Not all the &#8216;Marxisms&#8217; have been of this wholly reactionary 
order. There have also been various Maoisms, Trotskyisms, <a href="#n177" name="fn177" target="_self">
[177]</a> and innumerable Marxist academicisms. Most of these share, however, 
the same religious case of thought, in which a Marxism is proposed as an 
ultimate system of truth: that is, a theology. All seek to put Marx back into 
the prison of Marxism. Why there should have been this &#8216;epistemological break&#8217; 
from rationality to idealism, this rejection of the beginnings made in the 1950s 
and early 1969s, this reversion to an inner world of magical incantation and 
exalted theoretical illusion, this sealing off of the empirical senses, this 
self-closure of a tradition . . . this is a different problem, a problem of 
ideology and of the sociology of ideas which would require a distinct and 
extended treatment. I can now offer a few suggestions only.</p>

<p class="fst">Althusserianism is only one extreme form - and perhaps a passing 
form - of a general malaise, not of theory only, but of the political presence 
of today&#8217;s Socialist movement. In marking off its characteristics <i>as ideology</i>, 
I intend to mark also certain features which it shares with other Marxisms of 
closure.</p>

<p class="fst">The ideology has arisen, and been replicated, not in the Soviet 
Union, but within an advanced intellectual culture in the West. Its 
characteristic location has been in universities and other educational 
institutions and for other reasons, by a sharp division between &#8216;theory&#8217; and 
&#8216;practice.&#8217; The radicalisation of intellectuals within these institutions is 
often a somewhat enclosed and autonomous process, with no direct correlation 
with other sectors of society. So far from all Communist Parties providing this 
missing correlation, certain of these (for example, the PCF) directly express, 
in their organisational forms, another kind of severance of &#8216;theory&#8217; from 
&#8216;practice&#8217; &#8212; the higher echelons of the Party apparatus are possessed of the 
&#8216;science&#8217; which guides the &#8216;militants&#8217; of the &#8216;base.&#8217; The Party intellectuals 
are often further segregated, both within Paris (the intelligentsia's provincial 
ghetto) and within their own university branches.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus we commence with a <i>de facto</i> sociological and 
intellectual segregation of theory and practice. And, for larger political 
reasons, the kind of experience of mass political activity, in which 
intellectuals have played a minority and a subordinate (sometimes overly 
subordinate) part alongside comrades of diverse experience - and, in particular, 
alongside comrades with practical positions of leadership within their own 
communities and places of work - this kind of experience has largely passed them 
by. There has been no experience of anti-Fascist struggle, war and Resistance; 
not even any consistent and hard-fought programmatic or electoral struggle which 
intellectuals could bear to support; May, 1968 was over in a matter of days; 
such industrial struggles as the British miners&#8221; strike, which brought a 
government down, were accomplished without the necessity of any intellectual 
participation. Of course, here and there real struggles have flared up; and some 
comrades have gained authentic experience in the intense inner life of this or 
that sect. But in general it may be said that there has never been a generation 
of socialist intellectuals in the West with <i>less</i> experience of practical 
struggle, with less sense of the initiatives thrown up in mass movements, with 
less sense of what the intellectual can learn from men and women of practical 
experience, and of the proper dues of humility which the intellect must owe to 
this.</p>

<p class="fst">This is to say that today&#8217;s Western Leftist intelligentsia is 
distinguished by its lack of political experience and judgement. But this is not 
offered in any sense as an accusation of sin. It is a necessary consequence of 
the determinations of our time. We cannot remedy it by wishing it was otherwise. 
But it provides, nevertheless, the necessary ground within which the ideological 
deformations of our time are nurtured. Isolated within intellectual enclaves, 
the drama of &#8216;theoretical practice&#8217; may become a <i>substitute</i> for more 
difficult practical engagements. Moreover, this drama can assume increasingly 
theatrical forms, a matter of grimaces and attudinising, a game of &#8216;chicken&#8217;, in 
which each theorist strives to be &#8216;more revolutionary than thou.&#8217; Since no 
political <i>relations</i> are involved, and no steady, enduring struggle to 
communicate with and learn from a public which judges, cautiously, by actions 
rather than professions, the presses may reek with ideological terror and blood.</p>

<p class="fst">Moreover, this is precisely, the ground which can nurture an <i>
elitism</i> for which intellectuals, by a multitude of precedents, are only too 
well prepared. A generation indoctrinated by selective educational procedures to 
believe that their own specialised talents are a guarantee of superior worth and 
wisdom, are only too willing to accept the role offered to them by Althusser. It 
is easy for them to posture as &#8216;a very specific type of militant intellectual, a 
type unprecedented in many respects&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;These are real initiates, armed with the most authentic 
scientific and theoretical culture, forewarned of the crushing reality and 
manifold mechanisms of all forms of the ruling ideology and constantly on the 
watch for them, and able in their theoretical practice to borrow - against the 
stream of all &#8220;accepted truths&#8221; - the fertile paths opened up by Marx and barred 
by all the reigning prejudices.&quot; (<i>F.M.</i> 24)</p>

<p class="fst">That Althusser should also predicate &#8216;an unshake able and lucid 
confidence is the working class and direct participation in its struggles&#8217; can 
be easily met, either by taking out a Party card, or by hypothesising an ideal 
working class (for the present one is mystified into a false consciousness) 
which will be engendered in the image of Theory. For, as Althusser insists, 
&#8216;Marxist theory is produced by a specific theoretical practice, <i>outside</i> 
the proletariat', and &#8216;Marxist theory must be &#8220;<i>imported&#8221;</i> into the 
proletariat&#8217;. (<i>R.C</i>. 141) Indeed, his whole account of Marx&#8217;s 
&#8216;epistemological break&#8217; proposed that Theory was prior to and independent of the 
working-class movement&#8217;s own self-discovery, and that, ever since, that movement 
has been acting out, however inefficiently, Theory&#8217;s script.</p>

<p class="fst">What is so obvious is that this new <i>elitism</i> stands as 
direct successor in the old lineage: Benthamism, Coleridgean &#8216;clerisy&#8217;, 
Fabianism, and Leavisism of the more arrogant variety. Once again, the 
intellectuals - a chosen band of these - have been given the task of 
enlightening the people. There is no mark more distinctive of Western Marxisms, 
nor more revealing as to their profoundly anti-democratic premises. Whether 
Frankfurt School or Althusser, they are marked by their very heavy emphasis upon 
the ineluctable weight of ideological modes of domination - domination which 
destroys every space for the initiative or creativity of the mass of the people 
- a domination from which only the enlightened minority of intellectuals can 
struggle free.<a href="#n178" name="fn178" target="_self">[178]</a> No doubt 
this ideological predisposition was itself nurtured within the terrible 
experiences of Fascism, of mass indoctrination by the media, and of Stalinism 
itself. But it is a sad premise from which Socialist theory should start (all 
men and women, except for us, are originally stupid) and one which is bound to 
lead on to pessimistic or authoritarian conclusions. Moreover, it is likely to 
reinforce the intellectual&#8217;s disinclination to extend himself in practical 
political activity. To be sure, the (ideal) proletariat may, in this or that 
critical conjuncture, suddenly shift itself, like a geological fault, into a 
revolutionary posture, when it will be ready to receive the ministrations of 
Theory. Meanwhile, why bother to try to communicate - to educate, agitate, and 
organise - since the reason is powerless to penetrate the mists of &#8216;ideology&#8217;?</p>

<p class="fst">In this way, a &#8216;revolutionary&#8217; and &#8216;Marxist&#8217; critique, which 
despairs of communication and which has only a fictional political correlative, 
and which, moreover, reveals that all social evils are insoluble within 
capitalism, ends up as &#8216;the ideological husk of passivity&#8217;, in which the 
proclaimed need for &#8216;revolution&#8217; becomes a licence for intellectual withdrawal. 
In this way, as Enzensberger has warned,</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Marxist theory . . . can become a false consciousness if, 
instead of being used for the methodical investigation of reality through theory 
and practice, it is misused as a defence against that very reality . . . Those 
who wish to deprive Marxism of its critical, subversive power and turn it into 
an. affirmative doctrine, generally dig in behind a series of stereotyped 
statements which, in their abstraction, are as irrefutable as they are devoid of 
results.&#8221;<a href="#n179" name="fn179" target="_self">[179]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Althusserian theory has been perfectly adapted to this function, 
and designed for exactly this elitist intellectual <i>couche.</i> In particular, 
it allows the aspirant academic to engage in a harmless revolutionary 
psycho-drama, while at the same time pursuing a reputable and conventional 
intellectual career. As we have seen, every central theoretical position of 
Althusser is heavily derivative from orthodox bourgeois positions, in 
epistemology, structuralist sociology, &amp;c. The dwarfing of human initiatives by 
ideologies and things is entirely consonant with the dominant common-sense of 
conservative disciplines. Moreover, as political theory - because of the denial 
of experience and the repudiation of empirical controls - the practice can lead 
to <i>anything</i>, and justify <i>everything;</i> in any &#8216;conjuncture&#8217; a 
political or ideological &#8216;instance&#8217; can be hypothesised as &#8216;dominant&#8217;, and the 
&#8216;kangaroo factor&#8217; will carry it blithely from one prejudice to the next.</p>

<p class="fst">If this is all that Althusserianism is, as ideology - if it is no 
more than one of the successive fashions by which the revolting Western 
intelligentsia can do their thing without practical pain - then we have been 
wasting our time. But it is more serious than that. It is actively reinforcing 
and reproducing the effective passivity before &#8216;structure&#8217; which holds us all 
prisoners. It is enforcing the rupture between theory and practice. It is 
diverting good minds from active theoretical engagement. And, at a level of more 
vulgar political discourse, it affords theoretical legitimations for all the 
stupidest and most dangerous half-truths which, one had supposed, had at last 
gone away: that &#8216;morality = the interests of the working class&#8217;, that 
&#8216;philosophy = class struggle&#8217;, that &#8216;democratic rights and practices = &#8220;liberal&#8221; 
ideology&#8217;, and so on. Such a theory, if ever afforded any power, so far from 
&#8216;liberating&#8217; the working class would, in its insufferable arrogance and 
pretentions to 'science&#8217;, deliver them into the hands of a bureaucratic clerisy: 
the <i>next</i> ruling-class, waiting on the line.</p>

<p class="fst">This outcome seems unlikely. Most of those who have fallen under 
Althusserian influence are not cut out to be Stalinist priests. They are simply 
young men and women, who would <i>like</i> to be socialist revolutionaries, who 
have not found a medium of practical engagement, and hence have been taken for a 
ride. The terminus of that ride is outside the city of human endeavour and 
outside the domain of knowledge. So we can expect them to be absent from both. 
And yet, at the same time, we should not forget that this Theory is affording 
comfort and arguments to the most conservative elements within the most 
conservative Communist apparatuses. Like all ideologies, this one confirms the 
situation out of which it arose. In strengthening the extreme right-wing of the 
&#8216;Left&#8217;, it reproduces that inertia and that paralysis of the socialist will 
which was its own pre-condition of existence.</p>

<p class="fst">I cannot say whether theoretical practice is being taken up 
within the State orthodoxies of the Soviet Union and of Eastern Europe. It is, I 
suspect, both too sophisticated and too undisguisedly Stalinist for that; after 
all, if Stalin were alive today, he would be the first to recognise that Stalin 
committed . . . errors. The ultimate dream of theoretical practice is the 
resuscitation of the duality of temporal and spiritual powers in medieval 
Christendom: the Holy Proletarian Emperor will make his pilgrimage to Theory&#8217;s 
abode, where, after due interrogation in the doctrine, he will be crowned. This 
is not likely to come about. But a more sombre, and more conceivable, scenario 
comes to mind when one contemplates the situation in certain countries in the 
Third World. For Althusserianism is rather exactly tailored to the ideological 
requirements of an aspirant ruling-class - the <i>next</i> ruling-class to be - 
in societies where a section of the intelligentsia, greatly distanced from the 
masses, adopts policies which demand ruthless 'modernization&#8217;, Marxist and 
anti-imperialist rhetoric, contempt for democratic practices, and effective 
reliance on the economic and military protection of the Soviet State. If one 
considers for a moment the possible consequences if the Communist Party of India 
(one of the most unreconstructed Stalinist parties in the world) were to 
reinforce its existing anti-libertarian tendencies and contempt for the 
&#8216;petit-bourgeois&#8217; masses - tendencies amply displayed in its partnership in the 
recent Emergency - with a dose of Althusserian arrogance; and if its largely 
bourgeois and intellectual upper cadres were to become theoretical 
practitioners; and if the opportunity to practice, not only in theory, but upon 
the body of India, should return - then we could expect nothing less than the 
re-enactment of the full repertoire of high Stalinism within the raging inferno 
of Indian &#8216;scarcity.'<a href="#n180" name="fn180" target="_self">[180]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But we may leave this to the good sense of our comrades in India 
or Latin America, who face, every day, problems more palpable and more exacting 
than our own, who cannot pretend to draw the blinds upon experience or to place 
their theory here and their practice over there. All the same, it would be good 
to talk about it, and to exchange experiences on the political problems which we 
have in common. It would be good if the authentic international dialogue of 
libertarian Communism could be resumed.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h17">xvii</a></h3>

<p class="fst">I will conclude, as is now obligatory, with an <i>auto-critique.</i></p>

<p class="fst">Five years ago, in my &#8216;Open Letter to Leszek Kolakowski&#8217;, I 
discussed several meanings of contemporary Marxisms, and concluded with a 
general notion of Marxism as Tradition. Within this &#8216;tradition&#8217; I saw an immense 
variety of discourse, and quite incompatible sub-traditions; but, nevertheless, 
I argued that (uncomfortable as such co-habitation may be) all were united in 
the sense of employing a common vocabulary of concepts, many of which derived 
from Engels and from Marx. I suggested that one must be resigned to the 
strenuous activity of continually defining one&#8217;s position within this 
&#8216;tradition&#8217;; and that the only alternative was that of evacuating this tradition 
altogether - a choice which I refused. I preferred to remain within that 
tradition, even if some few of us remained only as &#8216;outlaws.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">I can now see that this was an inadequate and evasive resolution. 
Politically, it has long been impossible for the Stalinist and anti-Stalinist 
positions to cohabit with each other. It is clear to me now, from my examination 
of Althusserianism - and my implicit critique of other related Marxisms - that 
we can no longer attach any theoretical meaning to the notion of a common 
tradition. For the gulf that has opened has not been between different 
accentuations to the vocabulary of concepts, between this analogy and that 
category, but between idealist and materialist modes of thought, between Marxism 
as closure and a tradition, derivative from Marx, of open investigation and 
critique. The first is a tradition of theology. The second is a tradition of 
active reason. Both can derive some licence from Marx, although the second has 
immeasurably the better credentials as to its lineage.</p>

<p class="fst">I must therefore state without equivocation that I can no longer 
speak of a single, common Marxist tradition. There are <i>two</i> traditions, 
whose bifurcation and disengagement from each other has been slow, and whose 
final declaration of irreconcilable antagonism was delayed - as an historical 
event - until 1956. From this point forward, it has been necessary, both within 
politics and within theory, to declare one&#8217;s allegiance to one or the other. 
Between theology and reason there can be no room left for negotiation. 
Libertarian Communism, and the socialist and Labour movement in general, can 
have no business with theoretical practice except to expose it and drive it out.</p>

<p class="fst">If I thought that Althusserianism was the logical terminus of 
Marx&#8217;s thought, then I could never be a Marxist. I would rather be a Christian 
(or hope to have the courage of a certain kind of Christian radical). At least I 
would then be given back a vocabulary within which value choices are allowed, 
and which permits the defence of the human personality against the invasions of 
the Unholy Capitalist or Holy Proletarian State. And if my disbelief, as well as 
my distaste for churches, disallowed this course, then I would have to settle 
for being an empirical, liberal, moralistic humanist.</p>

<p class="fst">But I refuse these spurious choices which theoretical practice 
(and allied Marxisms) seek to impose. And, instead, I declare unrelenting 
intellectual war against such Marxisms: and I do so from within a tradition one 
of whose major founders was Marx. There is a certain cant, which has long been 
about, which seeks to avoid this engagement under the slogan: 'No enemies to the 
Left!' That slogan had a necessary and honourable origin, in the emergencies of 
anti-Fascist resistance; and, in political terms, such emergencies will often 
recur. But how is it possible to say that there are no such enemies, after the 
experience of high Stalinism, after Budapest 1956, after Prague 1968? And, 
within theory, what possible meaning is attached to &#8216;the Left&#8217; when it teaches 
lessons of anti-moralism, anti-humanism, and the closure of all the empirical 
apertures of reason.? Could Marx, or Morris, or Mann, have recognised any of the 
theory or practice of Stalinism, and acknowledged these as having even a 
notional relation to &#8216;the Left&#8217;? Does the suppression of reason, and the 
obliteration of the imagination, have any place on &#8216;the Left&#8217;? Does the 
confiscation by an all-knowing, substitutionist Party or vanguard of the 
self-activity and means of self-expression and self-organisation of the working 
people, constitute the practice of a&#8216;Left&#8217;?</p>

<p class="fst">What the cant slogan does is simply erect a moralistic defence 
around orthodox Communist organisation and practices - defences supplemented by 
the &#8216;ideological terrorism&#8217; of Althusser - intended to impress any socialist 
critic with a sense of guilt, a breach of solidarity. Hence the <i>status quo</i> 
is inviolable; any socialist critique is illicit (or is evidence of malicious 
&#8216;bourgeois or Trotskyite slander&#8217;); and the only licit criticism must be within 
the slow and opportunistic procedures of the apparatus itself. Hence the fight 
against Stalinism as theory and as practice must be left for ever unresolved. 
And as a consequence we are constructed into a space within which we commit 
daily breaches of solidarity with our comrades who are striving to dismantle 
Stalinism and who suffer under the reasons of Communist power.</p>

<p class="fst">In declaring &#8216;war&#8217; in this way - and in asking that others 
declare themselves less equivocally - I do not make a simple equation: Stalinism 
= all Communist organisations and forms. I do not declare all Communism to be 
infected, and suffering a terminal illness. I do not reject necessary, and 
clear-eyed, political alliances with Communist movements. I do not ignore the 
honourable (and, indeed, democratic) elements in the record of Communist 
struggle, in the West and in the Third World. I do not doubt the courage and 
commitment of Communist cadres, in a hundred anti-imperialist and anticapitalist 
struggles. I do not confuse Stalinism as theory, and as particular forms and 
practice, with the historical and sociological existence of Communist mass 
movements. I do not deny that, within the turn towards &#8216;Euro-Communism&#8217;, genuine 
struggles over principle are involved, as well as opportunist adjustments to an 
electorate. I do not refuse to note the genuine concern - and the public 
registration of this concern - at aspects of Soviet reality which have been 
increasingly evident within &#8216;Euro-Communism&#8217; since the time of Prague, 1968. I 
do not dismiss all this as hypocrisy; it is a welcome and important indication 
of an ulterior shift, often imposed upon the leadership by their own militant 
&#8216;base'. Above all, I expect, in the coming decades, fresh reinforcements for the 
war against Stalinism to arise - whether East or West - from within the 
Communist movements themselves. How these struggles will eventuate - and with 
what differences in Poland, Spain or Bengal - is a historical question, as to 
which theory would be foolish to predict.</p>

<p class="fst">What I mean is, rather, this. First, libertarian Communism, or a 
Socialism which is both democratic and revolutionary in its means, its strategy 
and objectives, must stand firmly, on an independent base, on its own feet, 
developing its own theoretical critique and, increasingly, its own political 
forms and practices. Only on these presuppositions can any &#8216;alliance&#8217; be 
negotiated; and if emergencies demand such an alliance, then it cannot be on 
orthodox Communism&#8217;s usual imperative terms: that ulterior theoretical and 
strategic differences be obscured or silenced, in the interests of a &#8216;Broad 
Left&#8217; (whose interests, are, in turn, ultimately those of the Party).</p>

<p class="fst">Second, the conditions for any common action must be a continuing 
and unequivocal critique of every aspect of the Stalinist legacy. Until the 
&#8216;agenda&#8217; of 1956 is completed, down to the last item of Any Other Business, any 
pretences as to the self-reform of Euro-Communism can rest only on the insecure 
pledges of electoral opportunism. The struggle must irradiate every level of 
theory and of practice - leading to radical changes in the forms of Communist 
Party organisation, and in the practical relations of Communists with other 
socialist bodies and with their own &#8216;constituencies&#8217; - and only on these 
preconditions, that common action accelerates such changes and discloses 
ulterior differences, can our purposes be served.</p>

<p class="fst">In Britain, with its small and declining Communist Party, these 
questions are of secondary importance. But, equally, the failure of the 
alternative, libertarian tradition, to enter that vacuum and establish itself as 
a political presence alongside the Labour movement - this failure is the more 
serious and less explicable. In the much-publicised &#8216;revival of Marxism&#8217; in 
Britain in the last two decades, a mountain of thought has not yet given birth 
to one political mouse. Enclosed within the intelligentsia&#8217;s habitual elitism, 
the theorists disdain to enter into any kind of relation with a Labour movement 
which they know (on a priori grounds) to be &#8216;reformist&#8217; and &#8216;corporative&#8217;, whose 
struggles created the institutions in which they are employed, whose labour made 
the chairs in which they sit, which manages to exist and to reproduce itself 
without them, and whose defensive pressures are all that stand between them and 
the reasons of capitalist power. Nor have these theorists created any 
independent agencies of political communication and education; the only agencies 
created are journals in which they can converse with each other. But this is to 
raise a new range of political questions, to be discussed on some other day.</p>

<p class="fst">I may sound more bitter than I am. I think there is, indeed, much 
energy and ability inside those barrels of enclosed Marxisms which stand, row 
upon row, in the corridors of Polytechnics and Universities. By striking a sharp 
and bitter blow at the Althusserian bungs, I hope I may let a little of that 
energy get out. If it should do so, then the problems of creating in this 
country an independent Left, engaged in a continual and fraternal dialogue of 
practice with the large Labour movement, might not prove to be insuperable after 
all. Those massive and impassive &#8216;structures&#8217; of our time might prove to be more 
vulnerable to human agencies than the Marxisms suppose.</p>

<p class="fst">And if any minds should get out, I hope they will bring Marx with 
them. I hope they will not bring only Marx; and they must certainly rid 
themselves of the truly scholastic notion that the problems of our time (and the 
experiences of our century) will become understood by the rigorous scrutiny of a 
text published one hundred and twenty years ago. To return, in every motion of 
analysis, to propositions of Marx is like going on a crosscountry run in leaden 
boots. William Morris expressed the matter with unerring sanity. &#8216;Tough as the 
job is you ought to read Marx&#8217;, he advised a correspondent: &#8216;up to date he is 
the only completely scientific Economist on our side.&#8217;<a href="#n181" name="fn181" target="_self">[181]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As the assembled ranks of Marxists express their sense of 
scandal, or dissolve into laughter, I will continue my argument It is not on the 
question of whether or not it is adequate to describe Marx as an &#8216;Economist.&#8217; 
This was the Marx available to Morris; and, one might add, it is the Marx to 
which the man is reduced, in effect, by &#8216;mode of production&#8217; manipulators and by <i>
Capital</i> navel-scrutinising groups. The point is, that <i>Marx is on our side</i>; <i>
we are not on the side of Marx.</i> His is a voice whose power will never be 
silenced, but it has never been the only voice, and its discourse does not have 
limitless range. He did not invent the socialist movement, nor did socialist 
thought in some way fall into his sole possession or that of his legitimate 
heirs. He had little to say (by choice) as to socialist objectives, as to which 
Morris and others said more - and more that is pertinent today. In saying this 
little he forgot (and at times appeared to deny) that not only Socialism but <i>
any</i> future made by men and women rests not only upon &#8216;science&#8217;, or upon the 
determinations of necessity, but also upon choices of values, and the struggles 
to give these choices effect.</p>

<p class="fst">The choice which faces the Marxist tradition today, and which has 
long faced it, is that between Idealist irrationalism and the operative and 
active reason. As for the Althusserians, they have long made that choice, and 
retired to the rituals of their own secluded observatory:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;As if an astronomical observatory should be made without any 
windows, and the astronomer within should arrange the starry universe solely by 
pen, ink and paper, so M. Althusser, in <i>his</i> Observatory (and there are 
many like it) had no need to cast an eye upon the teeming myriads of human 
beings around him, but could settle all their destinies on a slate, and wipe out 
all their tears with one dirty little bit of sponge.&#8221;<a href="#n182" name="fn182" target="_self">[182]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Maybe this observatory is already collapsing upon its rotten 
foundations. But other, more fashionable, more <i>avant-garde</i> observatories 
will be erected around its ruins. Before they are enclosed within some more 
well-appointed &#8216;Marxism&#8217;, I ask my readers also to choose.</p>

<p class="fst">I have now, on three occasions, beaten the bounds of&#8216;1956&#8217;. No 
doubt my critics are right; the return to that moment in the past has been, with 
me, obsessional; &#8216;there have been few confessions of fossilization as sad as 
this.&#8217;<a href="#n183" name="fn183" target="_self">[183]</a> At each defeat one 
should pick oneself up, brush the dust off one&#8217;s knees, and march cheerily on 
with one&#8217;s head in the air. But what if the defeat be total and abject, and call 
in question the rationality and good faith of the socialist project itself? And 
what if the protagonists within the socialist movement finally disengage at that 
point, and their absolute antagonism becomes declared? Can one then go on, head 
even higher in the air, just as before? I do not think so. But I promise not to 
mention the matter again. My dues to &#8216;1956&#8217; have now been paid in full. I may 
now, with a better conscience, return to my proper work and to my own garden. I 
will watch how things grow.</p>

an elementary knowledge of the history of philosophy will notice at once that 
what Althusser means by &#8220;empiricism&#8221;, could well be considered as the 
Aristotelian or Thomist theory of abstraction but that modern empiricism &#8482; 
beginning not with Locke but at least with fourteenth century nominalists - 
means exactly the opposite of this idea,&#8217;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> Only later (<i>L &amp; P.</i> 53) 
did Althusser make a <i>sotto voce</i> acknowledgement that Lenin&#8217;s categories 
&#8216;may&#8217; have been &#8216;contaminated by his empiricist references (e.g. the category of 
reflection).&#8217;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n7" href="#fn7">[7]</a> It has of course been so 
supposed, and in some quarters it still is: the opening chapters of Raymond 
Williams, <i>Marxism and Literature</i> (Oxford, 1977), are in one sense a 
sustained polemic against this supposition.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n8" href="#fn8">[8]</a> For the purposes of exposition

<p class="endnote"><a name="n9" href="#fn9">[9]</a> The other two are mathematics - 
acclaimed, but not drawn <i>upon</i> - and psycho-analysis, from which certain

<p class="endnote"><a name="n10" href="#fn10">[10]</a> The influence, scarcely 
acknowledged in <i>F.M.</i> (although see p. 78, note 40), is more pronounced in <i>
R.C</i>. (p. 102: &#8216;Spinoza&#8217;s philosophy introduced probably the greatest 
philosophical revolution of all time&#8217;), and fully declared in Essays, pp. 104,

F.M.</i> pp. 184-185.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n12" href="#fn12">[12]</a> Althusser follows Bachelard&#8217;s 
notion of a science which is constituted by an &#8216;epistemological break&#8217; with its 
&#8216;ideological&#8217; prehistory. Both <i>F.M.</i> (see pp. 167-8) and <i>R.C.</i> see 
post-1846 Marxism as constituting a Science (&quot;Theory&#8217;) in this way. In his 
subsequent self-criticism, Althusser takes away this notion with his left hand 
and then returns it (by way of the Party) with his right: <i>Essays</i>, pp. 
107-125.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n13" href="#fn13">[13]</a> For an excellent 
demonstration of the incompatibility of Althusser&#8217;s method with that of Marx, 
see Derek Sayer, &#8216;Science as Critique: Marx versus Althusser&#8217; in J. Mepham and 
D. Rubin (eds.), <i>Essays in Marxist Philosophy</i> (Harvester, 1978). I have 
found this essay helpful throughout, and also the lucid and thorough study by 
Simon Clarke, &#8216;Althusserian Marxism&#8217;, an important study as yet unpublished 
(copies obtainable from the author, Dept, of Sociology, University of Warwick).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n14" href="#fn14">[14]</a> As defined in the Glossary to <i>
R.C.</i> (p. 322) prepared by Ben Brewster and approved by Althusser.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n15" href="#fn15">[15]</a> See note 12 above. The 
emphasis in <i>R.C.</i> (pp. 59-60 and other passages) is such as to suggest 
that experiment and &#8216;other practices&#8217; (while perhaps permissible in the natural 
sciences) are evidence as to a science&#8217;s prehistory.</p>

congruence He in the ulterior congruence of Althusserian and positivist 
epistemology. This was argued long ago, in a forcible polemic by Paul Piccone, 
&#8216;Structuralist Marxism?&#8217;, <i>Radical America</i>, III, no. 5, September, 1969, 
which concluded: &#8216;Althusser is not aware of the history of recent positivism so 
that he does not realize that he has unwittingly appropriated their entire 
discarded problematic&#8217; (pp. 27-28). For an exact correspondence with Althusser&#8217;s 
propositions, see M. Oakeshott, <i>Experience and its Modes</i> (Cambridge, 
1933), p. 168. For a resume of the congruence, see H. Gilliam, &#8216;The Dialectics

<p class="endnote"><a name="n24" href="#fn24">[24]</a> By 1969 Althusser had 
narrowed the fully-approved texts to two: the <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i> 
(1875) and the <i>Marginal Notes on Wagner&#8217;s &#8216;Lehrbuch der politischen Okonomie</i>) 
(1880): these alone &#8216;are <i>totally and definitively exempt</i> from <i>any</i> 
trace of Hegelian influence&#8217; (L. <i>&amp; P.</i> 90). See also Francois George,

&#8216;Exploitation&#8217;, in <i>The Making of the English Working Class.</i></p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n27" href="#fn27">[27]</a> But this is too generous, 
since Althusser&#8217;s &#8216;definition&#8217; of empiricism is so slovenly and unlocated, on 
one hand, and so all-embracing (&#8216;rationalist&#8217;, &#8216;sensualist&#8217;, and &#8216;Hegelian 
thought&#8217;) on the other, as to leave us with only an epithet to attach to any 
views which he dislikes. See <i>R.C.</i> pp. 35-36.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n28" href="#fn28">[28]</a> One may take heart from the 
principled criticism which (after a little delay) American historians visited 
upon Fogei and Engerman&#8217;s <i>Time on the Cross.</i> The French historical 
profession (to judge by <i>Annales E.S.C.</i> in recent years) has not always 
offered the same principled defence against the universalist claims of the 
computer.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n29" href="#fn29">[29]</a> In its secondary form it is 
the accepted &#8216;findings&#8217; or accumulating knowledge of historians, which is (or

&#8216;predictive&#8217; character of certain notions of historical &#8216;laws&#8217; have force, and 
are stubbornly argued. Althusser would benefit from reading them.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n32" href="#fn32">[32]</a> In a blistering chapter (&#8216;The 
Need for a Philosophy of History&#8217;) in his <i>Autobiography</i>, R.G. Collingwood 
exposed exactly these confusions. &#8216;It was clear to me that any philosopher who 
offered a theory of &#8216;scientific method&#8217;, without being in a position to offer a 
theory of historical method, was defrauding his public by supporting his world 
on an elephant and hoping that nobody would ask what kept the elephant up&#8217; 
(Pelican, 1944; p. 61).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n34" href="#fn34">[34]</a> See note 15. The argument is 
little more than a gesture towards a particular French tradition of epistemology 
and idealist structuralism: Bachelard, Cavailles, Canguilhem and Foucault. See 
Simon Clarke, &#8216;Althusserian Marxism&#8217;, Part III, section 1, and <i>R.C.</i> 
43-46. It is significant that the only historian commended by Althusser is 
Foucault, his former pupil, who in his earlier work (work dominated by the 
concept of the &#8216;episteme&#8217;), also gives us history as a subject-less structure, 
and one in which men and women are obliterated by ideologies.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n36" href="#fn36">[36]</a> One part of this claim has 
come from authentic efforts to establish &#8216;scientific&#8217; procedures of 
investigation (quantitative, demographic, &amp;c.); the other part has stemmed from 
academic humbug, as &#8216;social scientists&#8217; have sought to maintain parity with 
scientific colleagues within educational structures (and in the face of 
grant-awarding bodies) dominated by utilitarian criteria. The older, 
&#8216;amateurish&#8217;, notion of History as a disciplined &#8216;Humanity&#8217; was always more 
exact.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n37" href="#fn37">[37]</a> J.H. Hexter&#8217;s &#8216;reality rule&#8217; 
- &#8216;the most likely story that can be sustained by the relevant existing 
evidence&#8217; - is, in itself, a helpful one. Unfortunately it has been put to work 
by its author in increasingly unhelpful ways, in support of a prior assumption 
that <i>any</i> &#8216;Marxist&#8217; story <i>must</i> be unlikely.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n38" href="#fn38">[38]</a> For a prime example of this 
misunderstanding, see Hindess and Hirst, op. cit., p. 312.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n39" href="#fn39">[39]</a> This does not mean that 
&#8216;history&#8217; may be seen <i>only</i> as process. In our time historians - and 
certainly Marxist historians - have selected process (and attendant questions of 
relationship and causation) as the supreme object of enquiry. There are other 
legitimate ways of interrogating the evidence.</p>

notwithstanding this, I will continue to use both terms.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n42" href="#fn42">[42]</a> By &#8216;concepts&#8217; (or notions) I 
mean general categories - of class, ideology, the nation-state, feudalism, &amp;c., 
or specific historical forms and sequences, as crisis of subsistence, familial 
development cycle, &amp;c. - and by &#8216;hypotheses&#8217; I mean the conceptual organisation 
of the evidence to explain particular episodes of causation and relationship.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n43" href="#fn43">[43]</a> One helpful elucidation of 
these procedures is in E.J. Hobsbawm, &#8216;Karl Marx&#8217;s Contribution to 
Historiography&#8217;, in R. Blackburn (ed.), <i>Ideology in Social Science</i> 
(1972).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n52" href="#fn52">[52]</a> It is significant that 
Althusser passes over the most serious epistemological error of Engels 
(&#8216;reflection theory&#8217;) without any critique. For critique would have involved him 
in (a) a consideration of the whole problem of &#8216;dialogue&#8217;, (b) in a consequent 
critique of Lenin (see note 6), and (c) in a self-critique which must have led 
on to a self-destruct, since his own epistemology (with Generalities I arising 
unbidden and unexamined) is a kind of &#8216;theoreticisf refiection-theory, 
reproduced in idealist form.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n53" href="#fn53">[53]</a> <i>Grundrisse,</i> p. 461.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n54" href="#fn54">[54]</a> Book I of <i>Capital</i>

Capitalist Production.&#8217;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n55" href="#fn55">[55]</a> When I made this self-evident 
point in 1965 I was sternly rebuked for my &#8216;incredibly impoverished vision of 
Marx&#8217;s work&#8217;: Perry Anderson, &#8216;Socialism and Pseudo-Empiricism&#8217;, <i>New Left 
Review</i>, 35 (January-February 1966), p. 21. I had not then read the <i>
Grundrisse.</i> The point is surely now established beyond any reach of 
argument?</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n56" href="#fn56">[56]</a> Marx to Lassalle, 22 February 
1858: &#8216;The thing makes very slow progress because as soon as one tries to come 
to a final reckoning with questions which one has made the chief object of one&#8217;s 
studies for years, they are always revealing new aspects and demanding fresh 
consideration.&#8217; (<i>Selected Correspondence,</i> p. 224). But seven years before 
Marx had assured Engels that &#8216;in five weeks I will be through with the whole 
economic shit.&#8217; He would then throw himself &#8216;into a new science ... I am 
beginning to be tired of it.&#8217; Cited in David McLellan, <i>Karl Marx, His Life 
and Thought</i> (1973), p. 283.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n57" href="#fn57">[57]</a> I am of course aware that 
this is a contentious area in which a hundred books and theses have been 
deployed. I am only reporting my own considered conclusion. Althusser also sees <i>
Capital</i> as a work of Political Economy (Marxist Science), although he sees 
this as a merit: &#8216;the theory of Political Economy, of which <i>Capital</i> is an 
example . . . considers one relatively autonomous component of the social 
totality&#8217; (<i>R.C.</i> 109). He also allows that, if chapter one of <i>Capital</i> 
is not read in <i>his sense,</i> it would be &#8216;an essentially Hegelian work&#8217; (<i>R.C.</i> 
125-126). He repeatedly insists that the object of <i>Capital</i> is neither 
theory nor social formations, but the capitalist mode of production (e.g. <i>L. 
&amp; P.</i> 76, cited above, p. 214; <i>P. &amp; H</i> p. 186). Colletti sees the 
problem (Is Marx making a critique of <i>bourgeois</i> Political Economy, or is 
he criticising Political Economy as such?) as remaining unresolved: &#8216;Interview&#8217;, <i>
New Left Review</i>, 86 (July-August 1975), pp. 17-18; Castoriadis, examining 
much the same problem, flatly concludes that Marxist economic theory is 
untenable: &#8216;Interview&#8217;, <i>Telos,</i> 23 (1975) esp. pp. 143-149.</p>

Roman Rosdolsky, <i>The Making of Marx&#8217;s &quot;Capital&#8221;</i> (London, 1977) has made a 
definitive analysis of the Hegelian structure of the <i>Grundrisse</i> and of 
the central status of the concept of &#8216;capital in general&#8217;, a status which 
remains central in <i>Capital.</i> The question arises throughout, but see 
especially pp. 41-52, 367-8, and his correct emphasis (p. 493) that &#8216;the model 
of a pure capitalist society in Marx&#8217;s work . . . represented a heuristic 
device, intended to help in the illustration of the developmental tendencies of 
the capitalist mode of production, free from &#8220;all disturbing accompanying 
circumstances.&#8221; See also I.L. Rubin, <i>Essays on Marx&#8217;s Theory of Value</i> 
(Detroit, 1972), p. 117.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n61" href="#fn61">[61]</a> Ibid p. 278. Such passages 
are licences for Althusser&#8217;s view of history is a &#8216;process without a subject.&#8217;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n62" href="#fn62">[62]</a> Ibid., p. 101. There is of 
course now an immense literature on the Hegel-Marx relationship. Althusser&#8217;s 
attempt to deny the Hegelian influence upon <i>Capital</i> has not survived it. 
For my purposes I wish to stress the strong and continuing Hegelian influence in 
these critical years: for 1857&#8212;8, see McLellan, op. cit., p. 304; for circa 
1861-2 see &#8216;Marx&#8217;s Precis of Hegel&#8217;s Doctrine of Being in the Minor Logic&#8217;, <i>

and Pseudo-Empricism&#8217;, pp. 19-21.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n64" href="#fn64">[64]</a> When Gareth Stedman Jones, 
&#8216;Engels and the End of Classical German Philosophy&#8217;, <i>New Left Review,</i> 79, 
(May-June 1973), refers (p. 25) to &#8216;the Darwinist laws of evolution&#8217;, it is not 
clear to me which <i>laws</i> are being referred to; although it is true that 
Engels, in <i>Dialectics of Nature,</i> saw evolutionary process as exemplifying 
dialectical laws: as Darwin did not.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n65" href="#fn65">[65]</a> <i>Selected Correspondence</i>, 
pp. 125-126. My italics. Engels had previously written to Marx that Darwin had 
&#8216;finished off teleology, and spoke of his &#8216;magnificent attempt ... to 
demonstrate historical development in nature.&#8217;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n66" href="#fn66">[66]</a> Ibid., p. 198. McLellan, for 
some reason, renders Marx&#8217;s &#8216;deathblow&#8217; to teleology as a blow to <i>&#8216;religious</i> 
teleology&#8217; (which Marx does <i>not</i> say). But he also usefully documents 
Marx&#8217;s subsequent criticisms of Darwin, pp. 423-24. These vary from comments on 
the ideological intrusion of notions of competition (&#8216;Hobbes&#8217;s &#8220;bellum omnium 
contra omnes&#8221;&#8217;) to the (very different) complaint that &#8216;in Darwin progress is 
merely accidental.&#8217; Lawrence Krader is the only authority known to me who has 
made a scholarly and exact definition of the point at issue: &#8216;The opposite of a 
teleological, directed law of nature and man attracted Marx to the conceptions 
of Darwin&#8217;: see <i>The Ethnological Notebooks of Karl Marx</i> (Assen, 1974), 
esp. pp. 82-85, also pp. 2, 354-355, 392-393. While Engels certainly employed 
more unconsidered analogies between natural evolution and historical process 
than did Marx, the attempt of many recent Marxologists to dissociate Marx from 
their common admiration of Darwin is absurd.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n67" href="#fn67">[67]</a> See Gerratana&#8217;s helpful (but 
over-reverent) essay, &#8216;Marx and Darwin&#8217;, <i>New Left Review,</i> 82 
(November-December 1973), pp. 79-80. However, the supposition that Marx had 
wished to dedicate a volume of <i>Capital</i> to Darwin has now been shown to be 
in error. (Darwin&#8217;s correspondent, on that occasion, was Edward Aveling.) See 
Margaret A. Fay, &#8216;Did Marx offer to dedicate <i>Capital</i> to Darwin?&#8217;, <i>
Journal of History of Ideas</i>, XXXIX, January-March, 1978; and <i>Annals of 
Science</i>, XXXIII, 1976.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n68" href="#fn68">[68]</a> Thus Marx&#8217;s reminder to 
himself, at one point in the <i>Grundrisse</i>, &#8216;to correct the idealist manner 
of this analysis.&#8217;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n69" href="#fn69">[69]</a> Nicolaus (<i>Grundrisse</i>, 
p. 60) follows Rosdolsky here. Since Rosdolsky&#8217;s work has been acclaimed in some 
quarters as definitive, it is necessary to make a critical comment on his very 
serious and scrupulous study. His discussion of the whole question of the 
historical dimension of <i>Capital</i> is confined to one footnote (p. 25, note 
56), dismissive of the phrase &#8216;turn everything round&#8217;, and to brief discussions 
of primitive accumulation in which Marx&#8217;s historical and empirical analyses are 
commended for &#8216;liveliness and persuasiveness&#8217; (p. 61) but scarcely considered 
further. In short, Rosdolsky shows little interest in historical materialism, 
sees the Hegelian structure (&#8216;capital in general&#8217;) of <i>Capital</i> as always a 
merit, and hence does less than justice to critics (including Marxist critics): 
notably to Rosa Luxembourg. I am not competent to comment on Rosdoisky&#8217;s status 
as an economic theorist; but one must regret that he can see <i>Capital</i> only 
as a heuristic academic exercise in economic theory, that his study contains <i>
no</i> discussion of Darwin or of the intellectual and political context more 
generally. In short, it is a serious but profoundly ahistorical work.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n70" href="#fn70">[70]</a> As Rosa Luxembourg wrote in a 
private letter from prison: &#8216;the famed Volume I of <i>Capital</i> with its 
Hegelian Rococo ornamentation is quite abhorrent to me&#8217;: <i>Briefe an Freunde</i>, 
p. 85, cited Rosdolsky, pp. 492-3. As Althusser exalts exactly these &#8216;Rococo&#8217; 
elements into &#8216;Science&#8217; I find myself coming to share Luxembourg&#8217;s abhorrence of 
them.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n71" href="#fn71">[71]</a> Thus Balibar (<i>R.C.</i>, p. 
202) declares that <i>Capital</i> sets the &#8216;hypothesis&#8217; of historical 
materialism to work &#8216;and <i>verifies</i> it against the example of the 
capitalist social formation.&#8217; A good example of Balibar&#8217;s general nonsense. A 
historical hypothesis could only be &#8216;verified&#8217; in historical investigation: and 
(as he and Althusser repeat <i>ad nauseam</i>) <i>Capitals</i> object is the 
capitalist mode of production and not &#8216;the capitalist social formation.&#8217;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n72" href="#fn72">[72]</a> The &#8216;historical&#8217; chapters of <i>
Capital</i> have inevitably had a stronger formative influence upon the British 
tradition of Marxist historiography than that of any other country; and for the 
same reason, a slavish adoption of Marx&#8217;s hypotheses was replaced fairly early 
by a critical apprenticeship to them. An interesting case is the suggestive 
final chapter of Volume One on &#8216;Primitive Accumulation&#8217;, which raised questions 
which were re-examined by M.H. Dobb, <i>Studies in the Development of Capitalism</i> 
(1946), which in turn gave rise to controversies which are resumed and discussed 
by John Saville, <i>Socialist Register</i>, 1969. But Saville&#8217;s discussion 
leaves open areas (accumulation through &#8216;colonial plunder&#8217;) which are being 
reopened from several directions (Wallerstein, Perry Anderson, and Indian 
Marxist historians such as Irfan Habib), who demand renewed attention to 
Britain&#8217;s imperial and colonial role. The point is that they are those 
hypotheses of Marx which are most alive which continue to undergo interrogation 
and revision.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n73" href="#fn73">[73]</a> Marx was himself, on 
occasion, careful to indicate the limits of this structure. Thus <i>Capital,</i> 
Volume Three (Chicago, 1909), p. 37, commences by speaking of &#8216;the life circle 
of capital&#8217;, and characterises Volume One as an analysis of the capitalist 
productive process &#8216;without regard to any secondary influences of conditions 
outside it.&#8217; On p. 96S: \ . . the actual movements of competition belong outside 
of our plan . ,. because we have to present only the internal organization of 
the capitalist mode of production, as it were, in its ideal average.&#8217; And so on. 
On other occasions he was less careful.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n81" href="#fn81">[81]</a> One characteristic of&#8216;1956&#8217; 
was the resurgence among Communist &#8216;revisionists&#8217; of a voluntarist vocabulary - 
notably Poland, Hungary, but also throughout the world movement. The various 
oppositions of 1956 were often led by militants whose sensibility had been 
formed in the decade 1936-46. A similar expression of &#8216;rebellion against fact&#8217; 
was evinced in the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. It is obligatory 
today to deplore the supposed &#8216;moralism&#8217; of this movement, although that 
&#8216;moralism&#8217; did more to exert a presence and to shift the terms of politics in 
this country than has anything in the subsequent fifteen years of Marxist 
&#8216;revival.&#8217;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n82" href="#fn82">[82]</a> I have discussed this

<p class="endnote"><a name="n86" href="#fn86">[86]</a> In view of Alvin Gouldner&#8217;s 
analysis of the genesis of Parsonian structuralism (<i>The Coming Crisis in 
Western Sociology</i>) I should make it clear that I do not mean that this 
thought was genetically the product of Cold War stasis: Gouldner is exactly 
right to place the critical experiential matrix in an earlier context. I mean 
that the ascendancy of Parsonianism as <i>ideology</i>, with massive academic 
and institutional support, was so.</p>

criticisms, they are either (a) marginal and so qualified as to constitute 
rhetorical (rather than intellectual) negotiations, or (b) so large that, if 
taken seriously, they call in question the earlier work <i>in toto.</i> We are 
thus entitied to take <i>F.M.</i> and <i>R.C.</i> as the most elaborated and 
most influential part of the Althusserian corpus. The subsequent writings are, 
generally, brutalised versions of the earlier, and are largely to be 
distinguished by the &#8216;militant&#8217; and 'revolutionary&#8217; posturing demanded by his 
Office as the leading philosopher of the P.C.F.</p>

seen that &#8216;law&#8217; is being used metaphorically, as &#8216;logic&#8217;, direction, or 
tendency. But this cannot excuse Marx&#8217;s reference, as in his first Preface to <i>

working with iron necessity towards inevitable results.&#8217; How is it possible for

<p class="endnote"><a name="n116" href="#fn116">[116]</a> As far as lam concerned, 
Jeff Coulter&#8217;s excellent study, &#8216;Marxism and the Engels Paradox&#8217;, <i>Socialist 
Register</i>, 1971, settles that question. The logical critique of Engels&#8217;s <i>
Naturdialektik</i> is, as far as it goes, sound; and it has been resumed, in 
somewhat similar ways, by K. Popper, &#8216;What is Dialectic?&#8217;, <i>Conjectures and 
Refutations</i> (1963), by Colletti in <i>Marxism and Hegel</i>, and by G. 
Stedman Jones, &#8216;Engels and the End of Classical German Philosophy&#8217;, <i>New Left 
Review</i> (May-June 1973) - which follows Colletti. But all then throw out the 
baby (&#8216;the conscious interception of the object in its process of development&#8217;) 
along with the Hegelian bathwater: see Coulter, pp. 129-132, 137-141.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n119" href="#fn119">[119]</a> Althusser&#8217;s distrust of 
dialectics follows, once again, contemporary fashion; as Coulter remarks (p. 
143, citing G. Pask, <i>An Approach to Cybernetics</i> 1963); cybernetic 
considerations have prevailed over notions of &#8216;dialectical leap&#8217;, especially in

his antique factoral notion of history: <i>F.M.</i> 111-2; Althusser, <i>Pour

<p class="endnote"><a name="n124" href="#fn124">[124]</a> But only <i>in this sense.</i> 
It is in the context of this polemic that Marx&#8217;s famous epigram arises (&#8216;The 
hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with 
the industrial capitalist&#8217;: <i>C. W.</i> VI, 166) - an aphorism which has been 
taken as licence for technological determinism: the productive forces &#8216;give you&#8217; 
society (Stalin - but also, in the last instance, Althusser, Balibar, 
Poulantzas). But the proposition can only be understood as a counter-proposition 
to Proudhon, for whom the division of labour proceeds from the idea (&#8216;I 
propose&#8217;) in a rational serial to the workshop and thence to the machines: see 
esp. <i>C.W.</i> VI, pp. 178-190 and <i>Selected Correspondence</i>, p. 10 (this

<p class="endnote"><a name="n134" href="#fn134">[134]</a> I have not attempted to 
sketch the full and complex history. An early consequence of Althusserian 
influence was expressed in a Maoist freak-out among his student following; then 
Althusser&#8217;s conservative posture during the May events, 1968, led to secessions 
and Althusserian heresies. And so on. These bits of theatre were predictable. 
Some part of the story is to be found in the lively apostasies of Jacques 
Ranciere, <i>La legon d</i>&#8217;<i>Althusser</i> (Gallimard, 1974); Rancière, &#8216;On 
the theory of Ideology&#8217;, <i>Radical Philosophy</i>, 7 (Spring 1974); and in

<p class="endnote"><a name="n137" href="#fn137">[137]</a> In <i>Essays</i>, p. 77, 
Althusser went so far as to write that &#8216;the national mass movement of the Czech 
people . . . merits the respect and support of all Communists&#8217;, exactly as &#8216;the 
&#8220;humanist&#8221; philosophies of western intellectuals (at ease in their academic 
chairs or wherever) &#8217; merited their criticism. Where, then, has Althusser been 
sitting, these last few years? And why should the same phenomenon merit the 
respect of Communists, but (if &#8216;Marxist humanists&#8217; should respect it) it must 
call for criticism?</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n139" href="#fn139">[139]</a> By 1975, when, in a 
curious piece of theatre, Althusser defended his doctoral &#8216;thesis&#8217; at Amiens, 
his language, as reported in <i>Le Monde,</i> had become even uglier: &#8216;I would 
never have written anything were it not for the 20th Congress and Khrushchev&#8217;s 
critique of Stalinism and the subsequent liberalisation . . . My target was 
therefore clear; these humanist ravings, these feeble dissertations on liberty, 
labour or alienation which were the effects of all this among French Party'

<p class="endnote"><a name="n143" href="#fn143">[143]</a> It is the more surprising 
that anthropological work of vitality and originality has emerged from within 
the sphere of Althusserian influence. Possibly Althusser&#8217;s ambiguous 
redefinition of the &#8216;economic&#8217; (see p. 197) gave back to French Marxist 
anthropologists a little space for movement. It must also be remembered that 
anthropology finds it easier to co-habit with a structuralism than does history.

are found, in their most ridiculous version, in <i>L. &amp; P.,</i> pp. 160-170, in 
the theory of ideological interpellation. More recently, Ernesto Laclau (<i>.Politics 
and Ideology in Marxist Theory,</i> New Left Books, 1977, chapters 3 &amp; 4), has 
sought to put this fairy-story to use. That Laclau occasionally appears to be 
more sensible than Althusser does not arise from any improvement in &#8216;theory&#8217; but 
from the fact that he starts off with rather more information about the real 
world. No doubt he will be embarrassed by this accusation - since he tells us 
that &#8216;modem epistemology asserts&#8217; (!!!) that &#8216;the &#8220;concrete facts&#8221; are produced 
by the theory or problematic itself (p. 59) - but in fact he <i>does</i> know a 
little about Fascism, Populism, &amp;c. He remains a kangaroo, but one who settles 
for longer periods and sniffs the real grass before he bounds off into the 
theoretical elements.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n149" href="#fn149">[149]</a> In case it should be 
supposed that this term has elitist connotations, I must note that it is a 
social category to be found thickest on the ground in Oxford, Cambridge, Paris, 
London, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n150" href="#fn150">[150]</a> Marx&#8217;s sixth thesis on 
Feuerbach declared that &#8216;the human essence is no abstraction inherent in each 
single individual. In its reality it is the <i>ensemble</i> of the social 
relations.&#8217; Mepham (see note 144) reports that &#8216;Marx&#8217;s formulation&#8217; was that 
&#8216;men are &#8220;ensembles of social relations&#8221;! How is one to keep up with 
mis-readings of this order?</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n151" href="#fn151">[151]</a> This is discussed by 
(among others) Norman Geras, &#8216;Althusserian Marxism&#8217;, <i>New Left Review</i>, 71 
(January-February, 1971); Geras, &#8216;Marx and the Critique of Political Economy&#8217;, 
in <i>Ideology and Social Science.</i></p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n152" href="#fn152">[152]</a> It is true that Marx 
sometimes appears to gesture towards a larger claim, notably in chapter XLVIII 
of <i>Capital</i>&gt; III (&#8216;The Trinitarian Formula&#8217;). This chapter, which is 
especially beloved by theoretical practitioners, was composed of three different 
fragments (in fact, three different unfinished attempts to write the same thing) 
which Engels found among Marx&#8217;s papers. We may leave to Marxologists the 
question as to the status to be afforded to such fragments. I find them 
suggestive, but they also provide renewed evidence as to Marx&#8217;s entrapment 
within the anti-structure of Political Economy: capital is seen as &#8216;a perennial 
pumping machine of surplus labour&#8217; (p. 957) which (if we forget that the 
resistance of labour is continually gumming up the pump) gives us another motor 
for an orrery.</p>

Althusser&#8217;s special licences for structuralism (<i>Capital,</i> III, p. 919), 
arising in a highly-condensed discussion of . feudal &#8216;labour rent&#8217;. See the

argued that Marxist Political Economy and &#8216;the &#8220;subjective&#8221; description of

equally original and not derived one from the other . . Karl Korsch, <i>Karl

<p class="endnote"><a name="n162" href="#fn162">[162]</a> As Jones shows (above), 
Engels was very much too modest. One may hazard that his extreme generosity to 
his friend was prompted by the fact that Marx had died only three months 
previously. In a subsequent note (to the new German edition of 1890) he was more 
just to himself.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n163" href="#fn163">[163]</a> Althusser returns 
constantly to this moment of Marx&#8217;s theoretical (and Hegelian) immobilism: in an 
index to Marx&#8217;s work in <i>R.C.</i> the longest entry is to the &#8216;1857&#8217; 
Introduction, the next longest to the Preface to the <i>Critique.</i></p>

add that the author has increasingly overcome this idealist legacy in his 
subsequent work.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n167" href="#fn167">[167]</a> Cornelius Castoriadis, <i>
L</i>&#8217;<i>éxperience du mouvement ouvrier</i> (Paris, 1974) ; <i>La societe 
bureaucratique</i> (Paris, 1973); <i>L</i>&#8217;<i>institution imaginaire de la 
societé</i> (Paris, 1975); <i>Les Carrefours du lahyrinthe</i> (Paris, 1978). In 
recent years the journal <i>Telos</i> has presented some of the work of 
Castoriadis and of Claude Lefort to an English-speaking public. Unfortunately I 
am unable to recommend the account of their work by an American enthusiast, Dick 
Howard, <i>The Marxian Legacy</i> (London, 1977). Howard&#8217;s study is an 
extraordinary essay in ashistorical and apolitical weightlessness, which reduces 
everything to an interminable North American post-New-Left academic seminar in 
something which he calls (inaccurately) &#8216;ontology&#8217;. Castoriadis has never been 
engaged in academicisms of this kind. The English &#8216;Solidarity&#8217; group has 
published some pertinent extracts from Castoriadis (&#8216;Paul Cardan&#8217;) in pamphlet 
form: &#8216;Solidarity&#8217;, c/o 123 Lathom Road, London E.6. Notably <i>Modern 
Capitalism and Revolution</i> (75p) and <i>History and Revolution</i> (20p). The 
latter pamphlet is twenty pennyworth of the best emetic to prescribe to Marxist 
theologians and theoretical practitioners - a sectarian emetic to be 
administered only to sectarians.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n168" href="#fn168">[168]</a> I find helpful James 
Henretta, &#8216;Social History as Lived and Written&#8217; (Newberry Library, Chicago, 
1977). I find actively unhelpful recent attempts to suggest a rupture in British 
Marxist historiography between the work of Maurice Dobb, and the historiography 
of the 1960s (including the work by myself and Eugene Genovese).</p>

<p class="endnote">I see on <i>both</i> sides of this supposed &#8216;break&#8217; a <i>common</i> 
tradition of Marxist historiography submitted to an empirical discourse (albeit 
with differing emphases); and &#8216;culturalism&#8217; is a term which I refuse: see R. 
Johnson, G. McLennan, B. Schwarz, <i>Economy</i>, <i>Culture and Concept</i> 
(Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, Birmingham University, 1978).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n171" href="#fn171">[171]</a> I have argued this again 
recently in my Postscript to <i>William Morris</i>, It has long been a theme of 
Castoriadis&#8217;s flanking attacks on Marxist theory and organisation: see e.g. &#8216;On 
the History of the Workers&#8221; Movement&#8217;, <i>Telos</i>, 30, Winter 1967-77. Agnes 
Heller, <i>The Theory of Need in Marx</i> (1976) deploys some of the materials 
for the necessary argument, but see also the thoughtful criticisms by Kate 
Soper, <i>Radical Philosophy,</i> 17, Summer 1977, pp. 37-42.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n174" href="#fn174">[174]</a> A very much more serious 
critique was commenced by Philip Corrigan and Derek Sayer, &#8216;Moral Relations, 
Political Economy and Class Struggle&#8217;, <i>Radical Philosophy</i>, 12, Winter 
1975, which starts excellently but then becomes dispersed, perhaps because the 
authors were unwilling to press their critique so far as to recognise the 
&#8216;silence&#8217; in Mara.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n177" href="#fn177">[177]</a> But the Trotskyisms have 
rarely offered &#8216;Theory&#8217; in such pretentious and mystifying ways. More often they 
represent a more old-fashioned return to a notional purified Leninism, which, 
while usually &#8216;economistic&#8217;, often inept, and always stridently self-righteous, 
is at least redeemed by some political activity, in the course of which the 
&#8216;cadres&#8217; learn a good deal, and often learn enough to carry them out of their 
own self-enclosed sects.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n178" href="#fn178">[178]</a> In certain hands, the 
Gramscian concept of &#8216;hegemony&#8217; can induce the same pessimistic determinism, as 
can Marcusian notions of the co-optation of the working class and of its 
organisations; so also can certain theoreticised notions of patriarchal and male 
domination, which - although sometimes presented by feminist writers - end up by 
depreciating women&#8217;s presence, and by confiscating their historical identity.</p>
