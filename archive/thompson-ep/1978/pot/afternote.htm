<h2><a name="h1">Afternote</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The text of <i>The Poverty of Theory</i> was completed in 
February 1978. In March the Union of the Left was defeated in the French 
elections. At the end of April Althusser published four articles in <i>Le Monde</i>, 
polemicising against the leadership of the French Communist Party. These have 
subsequently been republished by Maspero (<i>Ce qui ne peut durer dans le parti 
communiste francais),</i> and englished in <i>New Left Review</i>, 109, May-June 
1978.</p>

<p class="fst">These articles have been variously presented in different organs 
of the British Left, as a &#8216;dramatic and eloquent intervention&#8217;, and as the 
&#8216;devastating&#8217; pronouncements of a &#8216;non-dogmatic&#8217; and &#8216;supple&#8217; Marxist. Althusser 
has become a new &#8216;anti-Stalinist&#8217; culture-hero of the francophile British 
intelligentsia, and I have shown my usual ineptitude in choosing this moment to 
publish my critique.</p>

<p class="fst">Unfortunately I have not been able to obtain these&#8216;eloquent&#8217; and 
&#8216;devastating&#8217; articles. They have not yet reached me at Worcester. The articles 
which I have read were given up to the kind of political in-fighting predictable 
in the aftermath of a lamentable political defeat - a defeat ensured by the 
double-talk, double-tactics, and unabashed opportunism of the PCF One is given 
the impression that, if the Union of the Left had won 2% more of the poll, M. 
Althusser would have denied the world the benefit of his views. But defeat, 
repeating the experience of promise deferred which has become perpetual to 
generations of the French Left, has unloosed a squall of dismay, in which 
Althusser must either raise his voice above the others, or be consigned to 
nullity.</p>

<p class="fst">It would have been more impressive if Althusser&#8217;s critique (and 
in particular, his recommendation of joint action of the Left at the &#8216;base&#8217;) had 
been issued <i>before</i> the defeat, and in time to have influenced the 
campaign. It is, after all, rather familiar for unsuccessful politicians to find 
themselves exposed to retribution in the aftermath of defeat - and Althusser and 
his friends are playing the part of Mrs Thatcher to the Edward Heath of Marchais.</p>

<p class="fst">What distinguishes Althusser&#8217;s polemics is not their eloquence 
but their self-righteous tone and their utter lack of self-criticism. The 
Political Committee of the PCF is held responsible for all - for the Party's 
history, its strategies, and its ideology. The polemic is sharp, and sometimes 
caustic, in its exposure of the Party&#8217;s bureaucratic organisation and 
quasimilitary control. But this is, after all, a very old story, and one 
profoundly familiar to anyone with a practical (as opposed to theoretic) 
knowledge of the French Left. It has been written out, over several decades, by 
many hands: by Trotskyists and syndicalists, by the Communist oppositions of 
1956 and subsequently, by Sartre at large in the late 1950s, by our comrades of 
the first Nouvelle Gauche, of <i>France-Observateur</i> and the U.G.S., by <i>
Socialisme ou Barbaric,</i> by the activists of May 1968, and by many others. 
Throughout these decades, Althusser has refused any permissibility to this 
critique, and, as we have seen, has denounced it as &#8216;the most violent bourgeois 
anti-Communism and Trotskyist anti-Stalinism.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">No doubt we should admire his &#8216;supple&#8217;, even agile, Marxism. He 
has been able to move from &#8216;the cult of the personality&#8217; (1965) to &#8216;a Stalinian 
deviation&#8217; (1973) to a quite explicit dissent from Stalinist theory and forms - 
and all this in less than twenty years! We should perhaps welcome Althusser as a 
late developer, a philosopher innocent of practical political knowledge who has 
at length been enlightened by an electoral <i>debacle</i> in the classic arena 
of bourgeois democracy. But to what practical conclusions does this polemic 
lead? With much courting of the &#8216;militants of the base&#8217;, he calls for &#8216;a 
thorough critique and reform of the Party&#8217;s internal organisation.&#8217; Very good. 
And in what should such a reform consist? Rather little, perhaps, for Althusser 
insists that &#8216;democratic centralism&#8217; must be sacrosanct: the &#8216;militants&#8217; and the 
&#8216;masses&#8217; need no advice from &#8216;experts in bourgeois democracy - be they Communist 
or not.&#8217; This is a pre-emptive strike: Communist critics are forewarned that if 
they propose reforms which are not to Althusser&#8217;s taste, he will enter their 
names in the Black Book of Bourgeois Democracy. For the rest, we are offered a 
delphic inscrutability. My friend Douglas Johnson, who is rumoured to have 
private information, tells us (<i>New Statesman</i>, 7 July 1978) that 
Althusser&#8217;s proposed reforms would be of extensive reach: &#8216;Discussion should be 
possible within the cells. A militant should be able to write to the Central 
Committee and have the right to a reply.&#8217; I must remember to propose such 
devastating reforms in the cell of my local Labour Party.</p>

<p class="fst">What gives more pause for thought is Althusser&#8217;s third article (<i>Le 
Monde</i>, 26 April) on &#8216;Ideology.&#8217; Here he demands &#8216;a Marxist theory brought 
back to life: one that is not hardened and deformed by consecrated formulae, but 
lucid, critical and rigorous.&#8217; And he carefully explains that such a theory must 
be accompanied by <i>concrete analysis</i>! And, more than this, by <i>concrete 
analysis of class relations</i>! How very remarkable! And how remarkable, also, 
that he can intone these platitudes without a single tremor of self-criticism! 
For two decades Althusser and his immediate circle have had more influence upon 
the ideology of French Communist intellectuals than any other group. And this 
influence can be seen, precisely, in the reduction of Marxism to elaborate 
consecrated formulae, in the abject divorce (under the blanket attack of 
&#8216;empiricism&#8217;) between &#8216;theory&#8217; and concrete analysis, and in the reduction of 
the analysis of class relations to metaphysical permutations. So that the first 
requisite of a critique of the ideology of the PCF must be a rigorous and 
unforgiving critique of Althusser&#8217;s works themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">I borrow the term &#8216;unforgiving&#8217; from Althusser. He tells us that 
concrete analysis, and also theory, &#8216;do not forgive.&#8217; But the necessary critique 
of the theory and practices of the PCF will turn out to be very much less 
forgiving than he supposes. For the PCF was, for many years, the major bastion 
of Stalinism in the non-Communist world, and its leaders had unusual positions 
of influence within the counsels of the Comintern.</p>

<p class="fst">It is true that Althusser takes a step towards honesty, when he 
admits that (&#8216;between 1948 and 1965&#8217;) the PCF held its own faked &#8216;trials&#8217; of 
critics and intimidated and blackballed independent sections of the French Left 
with campaigns of calumny. But, cheek by jowl with this, he twice invokes the 
memory of Maurice Thorez, and a supposed Golden Age of vital theory and honest 
practice. This is a useful demogogic trick to pass on the &#8216;militants', in whose 
memory Thorez is indelibly identified with the great mass anti-fascist struggles 
of the 1930s. But does not Althusser also know that Thorez (the Moscow exile of 
the Resistance) was a major engineer of Stalinism within the Comintern, the 
architect of that subordination of the International to Soviet interests, and of 
those structures, practices and ideology which <i>now</i> (in 1978) Althusser 
can at last identify as Stalinist? Does he not know that, according to the 
testimony of two members of the Central Committee of the PCF of that time (<i>Politique 
Hebdo</i>, Spring 1976; <i>Socialist Register</i>, 1976), in 1956 Thorez 
attempted to suppress from his own members any knowledge of Khrushchev&#8217;s secret 
report to the 20th Congress, and was associated with Molotov, Malenkov and 
Kaganovitch in their attempt to overthrow Khrushchev in a <i>coup</i>? Althusser 
is a signatory to the appeal for the clearing of the name of Bukharin, and this 
does him credit. No doubt he will be interested to learn that, when Khrushchev 
and his colleagues signified their intention to &#8216;rehabilitate&#8217; Bukharin, Rykov 
and Zinoviev, it was Thorez who flew to Moscow to beseech them to maintain 
silence (Ken Coates, <i>The Case of Bukharin,</i> Postscript)?</p>

<p class="fst">If Althusser wishes to revive the tradition of Thorez, then new 
Althusser is but old Thorez writ large. With Althusser, the critique of 
Stalinism has not even begun, nor can it begin, since his own thought is both 
the consequence of Stalinism and its continuance. But I do not wish to trespass 
further into French affairs: we can safely leave this unforgiving accounting to 
our French comrades.</p>

<p class="fst">What concerned me in <i>The Poverty of Theory</i> was not the 
particular situation of Althusser in France - the signs, and the complexities, 
of that situation I may not always have correctly read - but the influence of 
transposed Althusserian thought outside of France. And it is necessary to note 
the consistent misinformation as to French political realities, and 
mystification as to French intellectual affairs, which has been passed upon the 
English-speaking Left by the British francophiles who have, for some fifteen 
years, been promoting a purported &#8216;revival of Marxism&#8217; in this country.</p>

<p class="fst">I make no objection to francophilia. There is very much in French 
intellectual and political life to learn from and to admire. But our own 
agencies, who have taken out their franchises to import Althusser, Balibar, 
Poulantzas, Lacan, &amp;c., have consistently presented images of French life and 
politics which are little more than fairy-tales derived from Parisian cafe 
gossip. <i>New Left Review</i> (and New Left Books) hold a particular 
responsibility for this, since over the past fifteen years they have issued, to 
the accompaniment of ecstatic &#8216;presentations&#8217; and theoretical heavy breathing, 
every product, however banal, of the Althusserian <i>fabrik;</i> and, from 
France or about France, they have <i>issued nothing else.</i> So that, whatever 
esoteric reservations the <i>Review&#8217;s</i> editors may hold as to Althusser, the 
imposition has been passed upon an innocent public that the French proletariat = 
the PCF, a Party supposedly composed of a heroic, uncomplicated, militant 
&#8216;base&#8217;, adjoined to which are rigorous and lucid Marxist theorists, imbricated 
in the concrete life of the Party.</p>

<p class="fst">One distasteful aspect of this fairy-story is that it has 
contributed, over the same period, to an actual breach of solidarity between 
ourselves and the very vigorous libertarian and anti-Stalimst Left in France, 
with which the first New Left had the closest fraternal associations, but whose 
activities are now neither examined nor even reported. So that, in the name of 
francophilia, exchanges have actually become more difficult with those 
independent French intellectuals and activists whom the PCF has chosen to 
blackball or calumniate. And an equally distasteful consequence is that the <i>
soi-disant</i> Marxist Left in Britain is wholly unprepared to understand the 
long-delayed disaster that has now, at length, overtaken the Communist 
intellectual tradition in France.</p>

<p class="fst">For the drama of the last two decades has been wholly misreported 
in this country. It has never been the arduous intellectual epic that British 
promoters supposed. A number of episodes have been - and have been <i>seen</i>, 
by an increasing number of French intellectuals, to be - farce. One does not 
have to be as old as Methuselah to recall the years when Roger Garaudy (the Dr 
John Lewis of France) held the Office of Corrector of Bourgeois Heresies 
throughout the Western World - an office from which he was deposed as 
preliminary to his reconciliation with the Catholic Church! More than in any 
other Western country, the PCF succeeded in intimidating their intellectuals and 
in neutralising them with bourgeois guilt. The intellectuals were segregated in 
their ghettos, and subordinated to the discipline of the Party&#8217;s clerisy. The 
consequent rupture between theory and practice found a classical expression in 
Althusserian thought. More resistant to the education of experience than any 
other Western Communist Party, the PCF met the demise of Stalinism and the 
reinvigoration of capitalism with the rigorous response of an ostrich. This 
meant, for the Party leadership, a collapse into pragmatism and opportunism; 
and, for the intellectuals, a swift passage into idealism &#8212; a 
theoretically-justified <i>refusal</i> of evidence, of history, of &#8216;empiricism.&#8217; 
Now, after many decades of battering at the door, social being is finally making 
a late forced entry upon social consciousness. Suddenly, the Party intellectuals 
in their breached fortress are making &#8216;eloquent&#8217; and &#8216;devastating&#8217; signals of 
recognition of. . . what everyone outside that fortress has long known.</p>

<p class="fst">I will not predict Althusser&#8217;s future evolution. He is unlikely 
to follow the path of Garaudy. What I will predict is that all that high and 
rigorous theory will collapse, for a decade, into a shambles, and that the 
tenacious posthumous Stalinism of the French Communist intelligentsia will 
vanish in a year or two amidst cries of <i>sauve qui peut!</i> I cannot say that 
this prospect displeases me. I found the cruel and largely-unmerited <i>debacle</i> 
of an honourable French Communist tradition of the Thirties and of the 
Resistance to be tragic; but in the last two decades I have seen less honour and 
more bad faith in that quarter. The work of rebuilding a libertarian 
revolutionary tradition in France has long been going on elsewhere.</p>

<p class="fst">In certain of these judgements I may be ill-informed. It is 
possible, even, that Althusser may prove to be more serious in his new-found 
anti-Stalinism than I suppose. Let us hope that this is so. But if he is to be 
so, then he must revoke the greater part of his own published theory. And this 
is what <i>The Poverty of Theory</i> is about. For the theory remains <i>as</i> 
theory, is replicated as theory, and is transplanted as theory, whatever 
personal or public contingencies arise. In this, at least, I am glad to be 
confirmed by Althusser. For, as he remarked rather grandly in an interview' to <i>
Les Nouvelles Litteraires</i> (8 June 1978): &#8216;Philosophe, je ne suis pas piege 
par les effets de la politique publique quotidienne . . / Historian, je ne suis 
pas either. There is not one sentence in <i>The Poverty of Theory</i> which I 
wish to retract.</p>
