<h2><a name="h1">Postscript</a></h2>

<p class="fst">I have not contributed a position paper to this book, since <i>
The Poverty of Theory</i> is that. And it remains that. I have followed and am 
following the discussion which is going on, in <i>History Workshop Journal</i> 
and elsewhere, and am learning from it. But I have not changed my positions at 
any central point. However, the articles of Richard Johnson and Stuart Hall 
raise points which require a comment.</p>

<p class="fst">First, I simply want to place on this table certain refusals. Of 
which the most substantial is this: I reject without reservation the 
identification of the Marxist tradition of historiography of which I have been 
taken as one representative of &#8216;culturalism&#8217;. The term is of Richard Johnson&#8217;s 
invention. He comes before us, in his article, reproving everyone except himself 
for &#8216;theoretical absolutism&#8217;. This results, he argues, in an inflation of 
issues, a whole massive . . . investment in one particular set of differences.&#8217; 
I am told that my polemic &#8216;hardens up differences . . . reproduces really 
unhelpful polarities.&#8217; Yet it is, of course, the specious opposition between his 
invented category, &#8216;culturalism&#8217;, and a supposedly authentic Marxism (which, 
however, has no representative historical works which can point to ... as yet) 
which is a theoretical absolutism, and which it does all these things.</p>

<p class="fst">This category of culturalism is constructed from some sloppy and 
impressionistic history. Examine Johnson&#8217;s description of &#8216;the Moment of 
Culture&#8217;. &#8216;Roughly mid-1950s - early 1960s.&#8217; &#8216;Key texts: Raymond Williams&#8217;s 
early work: EPT&#8217;s <i>Making:</i> Hoggart&#8217;s <i>Uses?</i> This gives us a 
mish-mash, a &#8216;cultural&#8217; blur. What puzzles me is that Richard Johnson, who has 
worked across a corridor from Smart Hall for several years, could read the 
history like that In the mid-1950s Richard Hoggart&#8217;s attitude to Marxism was one 
of explicit hostility, Raymond Williams&#8217;s was one of active critique, Stuart 
Hall&#8217;s (I would summarise) was one of sceptical ambivalence, whereas, from 1956 
onwards, the <i>Reasoner</i> group, with which was associated, closely or 
loosely, a number of Marxist historians - among them John Saville, Dorothy 
Thompson, myself, Ralph Miliband, Michael Barratt Brown, Peter Worsley (an 
anthropologist, but we will allow him in), Ronald Meek, Roy den Harrison, and, 
less closely, Christopher Hill and Rodney Hilton, and (as a friendly but 
politically distanced critic) Eric Hobsbawm - this group was attempting to 
defend, re-examine and extend the Marxist tradition at a time of political and 
theoretical disaster.</p>

<p class="fst">I am not saying that we were right, and that Hoggart or Raymond 
Williams or Stuart Hall were wrong. I am not trying to fight out old fraternal 
battles or differences over again. It may well be that we old Marxists at that 
time had got into ruts, and that Hoggart, Williams or Hall, running free on the 
surrounding terrain, helped to tow us out. What I am objecting to is this 
mish-mash, coming from the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies. After all, 
not only MI5 keeps files: some of <i>us</i> have files as well. And there were 
some fierce polemics in those days - for example, on the question of the 
Pilkington Report - which turned precisely on the question of &#8216;cultural 
studies&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst">What I am struggling with is the irony that we Marxists then were 
subjected to an unremitting critique from positions of an explicit and 
articulated culturalism; yet today some of those critics have turned full 
circle, and are accusing us, from positions which are claimed as authentically 
Marxist, of those culturalist sins - that &#8216;Moment of Culture&#8217; - which was, 
precisely, their own. It is not a question of the theoretical rights or wrongs 
of the issues: the critique, then or now, may have force. It is simply a 
question of getting the history straight, which as historians we ought to do.</p>

<p class="fst">Let me give one illustration. Richard Johnson tells us that this 
&#8216;Moment of Culture&#8217; produced powerful paradigms of the study of the culture: for 
example, the &#8216;centrality of lived experience - cultural as a whole way of life.&#8217; 
When Raymond Williams&#8217;s <i>The Long Revolution</i> came out, Stuart Hall, as 
editor of <i>New Left Review</i>, commissioned me to write a review article upon 
it. After reading the book I asked to be relieved of the task, since I found my 
theoretical differences with Williams to be so sharp that, to express them 
fully, would endanger the political relations of the New Left. (I mention this 
anecdote because it may illustrate the dangers of theoretical opportunism, or 
the covert suppression of differences - without any Stalinist or Leninist 
intervention - when one is engaged in an active, urgent and fraternal common 
political movement.)</p>

<p class="fst">Stuart Hall, who was not then, and who is not now (I think) a 
Stalinist, rejected my refusal and encouraged me to write out my critique fully 
and without inhibition. My article, which appeared in two numbers of <i>New Left 
Review</i> (Nos 9 and 10, May-June and July-August 1961) - in fact in three, 
since a page was inadvertently dropped and appeared subsequently on the line 
like a single sock (September-October, 1961) - was precisely a critique of 
Williams&#8217;s claims for &#8216;cultural history&#8217;, as the history of &#8216;a whole way of 
life&#8217;, and a critique in terms of Marxist categories and the Marxist tradition, 
which offered the counter-proposal of &#8216;a whole way of struggle&#8217;, that is, class 
struggle. I argued in this piece:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Any theory of culture must include the concept of the 
dialectical interaction between culture and something that is not culture. We 
must suppose the raw material of life-experience to be at one pole, and all the 
infinitely-complex human disciplines and systems, articulate and inarticulate, 
formalised in institutions or dispersed in the least formal ways, which 
&#8216;handle&#8217;, transmit, or distort this raw material to be at the other. It is the 
active <i>process</i> - which is at the same time the <i>process through which 
men make their history</i> &#8212; that I am insisting upon.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">And I argued, explicitly, that we could not grasp the one pole 
without the concept of the &#8216;mode of production&#8217; nor the other pole without the 
concept of &#8216;ideology&#8217;. I proposed directly that there was a theoretical gap, in 
the formative New Left, between Williams&#8217;s &#8216;cultural history&#8217; and the Marxist 
tradition, and discussed ways in which this might be bridged, or exchanges 
between the traditions might be most fruitful.</p>

<p class="fst">Any reader going back to that exchange from today&#8217;s more 
theoretically conscious world will find my defence of the Marxist tradition to 
be not only lacking in confidence but also innocent. We Marxist dissidents, in 
the years 1956 to 1962, were beset not only by radical inner doubts and 
self-criticism, but also by a total climate of scepticism or active resistance 
to Marxism in any form. This climate permeated the New Left also, at its origin, 
and many comrades then shared the general view that Marxism, in its association 
with the Soviet state and with indefensible communist apologetics, was a 
liability which should be dumped, while new theories were improvised from less 
contaminated sources. My defence of the Marxist tradition then, against 
culturalism, has none of the robust confidence which characterises &#8216;The Moment 
of Theory&#8217;. When I brought <i>Capital</i> forward to challenge one of Williams&#8217;s 
propositions, I felt it obligatory to cover my quotation with an apology:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Oh, <i>that</i> book! Do we really have to go over all that 
old nineteenth-century stuff again? We have all felt this response: Marx has 
become not only an embarrassment but a bore. But <i>The Long Revolution</i> has 
convinced me, finally, that go over it again we must.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">In the past fifteen years - &#8216;the Moment of Theory&#8217; - this 
going-over has been done, even to the point of obsession. There have been some 
strange reversals of position in the same period. Williams has submitted some of 
his own culturalist positions to a self-critique far more thoroughgoing than any 
that I offered in 1961. Williams and, certainly, Stuart Hall have shown 
increasing respect and confidence in the notion of a Marxism as a total and 
systematic theory, and, to the same degree, my own confidence in such 
systematisation has become less. So . . . let me make clear, once again, what I 
am arguing about. I am <i>not</i> proposing that, in 1961,1 was right and that 
Hoggart, Williams or Stuart Hall were then wrong. I admire all these writers, 
for many things; the dialogue of the early New Left was a fruitful one, from 
which both traditions gained; and today I am very close indeed to Raymond 
Williams on critical points of theory.</p>

<p class="fst">My point is that my critique of what Johnson calls culturalism 
appeared in 1961: that is, <i>exactly</i> when I was in mid-flow in writing the <i>
Making of the English Working Class.</i> And that the <i>Making</i> was written, 
not only during a period of polemics against Stalinism and positivist economic 
history, but also during a conscious and open-running critique of &#8216;culturalism&#8217;. 
And it is very easy to establish this point, without resort to nuanced private 
histories or files.</p>

<p class="fst">What Richard Johnson is not interested in - what scarcely seems 
to enter the door of the Birmingham Centre for Cultural Studies - is any 
consideration of the <i>politics</i> of his &#8216;moments&#8217;. His notion of &#8216;theory&#8217; is 
abstracted from any analysis of the generative political context, and what he is 
interested in - and how could he write this phrase without feeling a chill 
somewhere in his epistemological organs? &#8212; is &#8216;the production of really useful 
knowledge&#8217;. Which knowledge, however, must not be tainted by empiricism, must be 
at a high level of abstraction, and must point towards a Utopia when total 
history will at last be written. Some rather important &#8216;texts&#8217; of that &#8216;Moment 
of Culture&#8217; are altogether overlooked: Khrushchev&#8217;s secret speech (a text which 
still requires close and symptomatic reading); the speeches of John Foster 
Dulles; the crisis of British imperialism at Suez; the debates at the 8th Plenum 
of the Polish Communist Party, the poems of Wazyk, the stories of Tibor Dery, 
and on and on.</p>

<p class="fst">What brought that jumble-sale of theoretical elements together in 
the first New Left was not a moment of culture at all, but a common sense of 
political crisis. It was the politics of that moment which directed all of use, 
from different traditions, to certain common problems, which include those of 
class, of popular culture and of communications. Examine that moment - situate 
yourself for a Marxist historical or cultural analysis - and you must commence, 
not within theory, but within the political world. Marx would have started that 
way; for what concerned Marx most closely was not &#8216;economics&#8217; nor even (dare I 
say it?) epistemology but <i>power.</i> It was to understand <i>power</i> in 
society that he entered that lifelong detour into economic theory.</p>

<p class="fst">We thought, in the late 1950s, watching the flames arise above 
Budapest, the traditional working-class movement erode around us, while nuclear 
war seemed imminent, that we had to enter different detours in pursuit of the 
same questions. Social being had made a convulsive and overdue entry upon social 
consciousness, including Marxist consciousness, and the times set us not only 
certain questions but indications as to how these must be pursued. This, and not 
culturalism, proposed the questions addressed in the <i>Making.</i> It is 
altogether right that readers today are dissatisfied with the book, or, if not 
dissatisfied, are looking for different books. Today is proposing, urgently, 
different questions.</p>

<p class="fst">But what is all this theory, or even &#8216;socialist history&#8217;, about 
it if is so ecumenical that power and politics scarcely matter at all? Richard 
Johnson will not have us inflating differences: our discourse must be &#8216;careful 
and respectful&#8217; and be conducted in a &#8216;sisterly and brotherly way&#8217;. It is easy 
to be respectful, sisterly and brotherly, if one&#8217;s theory can never do so much 
as bend a pin in the real political world: if one never has to be called to 
account for one&#8217;s theories, since the gap between theory and actuality is so 
rarely crossed: or if theory is reduced (in part by external determinations, in 
part by our own inward-turning mentalities) into little more than a psychodrama 
within the enclosed ghetto of the theoretical left.</p>

<p class="fst">It is, I agree, improper to get heated about Stalinism in an 
academic seminar. It is certainly wrong for elderly teachers to bully or 
indoctrinate the young. But is it possible to carry over the proper procedures 
of academic discussion into the political world just like that? For there is 
another political world, to which <i>The Poverty of Theory</i> was addressed. 
And it is a world which, like it or not, is less than sisterly or brotherly, in 
which we must acknowledge solidarities, and discriminate between theoretical 
kin.</p>

<p class="fst">I was going to leave it at that. But I have recently received 
this criticism from many quarters - &#8216;fighting old battles&#8217; and the like - and 
something more must be said. There is, first, the matter of aggression. <i>The 
Poverty of Theory</i> is sometimes presented as an unseemly act of aggression, 
breaking in upon and disorganising a constructive, &#8216;careful and respectful&#8217; 
discourse of the theoretical left. But, from the position of my tradition, the 
matter of aggression can be seen very differently. For a full decade a 
theoreticist and structuralist campaign had been directed at our positions, for 
their supposed &#8216;empiricism&#8217;, &#8216;humanism&#8217;, 'moralism', &#8216;historicism&#8217;, theoretical 
vacuity, etc. This campaign had almost overwhelmed the older Marxist tradition 
in sociology, rooted itself deeply in the criticisms of film, art and 
literature, and was massing on the borders of history. What seemed to be at 
risk, then, was not this or that book of mine or of Genovese&#8217;s - and I don&#8217;t at 
all wish to protect our work from criticism - but a whole tradition of Marxist 
historical practice, which had never been theoretically vacant, and whose very 
continuity seemed to be under threat. In this sense. <i>The Poverty of Theory</i> 
was not an act of aggression but a counter-attack against a decade of 
Althusserian dismissal.</p>

<p class="fst">Second, I really don&#8217;t think that Richard Johnson himself 
understands the way in which a certain kind of appeal for an absence of polemic, 
for &#8216;careful and respectful&#8217; discussion in &#8216;brotherly and sisterly&#8217; ways, can be 
a stratagem for doing two things: first, removing socialist theory from a 
political to an academic context, and he also insists that &#8216;the Moment of 
Theory&#8217; must be removed from context also. To point out, as I have done, that 
this Moment originates in the work of Althusser, in a very particular context of 
polemic (as well as organisational measures, expulsions, controls, etc.) within 
the French Communist Party against libertarian and humanist critics within the 
French Marxist and socialist movement is to introduce improper (untheoretical) 
considerations.</p>

<p class="fst">But this is pre-emption with a vengeance. It is to say that 
discussion must be on the ground which he has indicated and on no other. It is 
to say, also, that considerations of ideology, while no doubt proper when we are 
examining racism, sexism, empiricism, humanism and the rest, are quite improper 
- even inconceivable - when considering the communist or Marxist movement, where 
all arises in a medium of pure theory. Richard Johnson declares, in his position 
paper, in his careful and respectful way, that 1 see <i>The Poverty of Theory</i> 
as mainly mischievous in its effects.&#8217; I have been trying to explain why I find 
his new absolutist category of &#8216;culturalism&#8217; to be mischievous also. It is a 
category which he has shown, not only into national but also into international 
discourse, and, if uncontested, it would lead to serious misrecognitions, and 
threaten to close off or eject a large and still-creative tradition of 
open-ended Marxist or marxisant historical practice. But to contest that 
ejection it is not adequate to enter meekly upon the ground which he has 
declared to be legitimate, and then argue respectfully that this is or that 
formulation is incorrect. It is necessary to refuse his ground and his terms.</p>

<p class="fst">In doing this, voices sometimes get raised. And I am chided for 
this by Gareth Stedman Jones, a comrade and historian whom I greatly respect. He 
says, in <i>History Workshop Journal 8</i>, &#8216;Since <i>Pre-Capitalist Modes of 
Production</i> and <i>The Poverty of Theory</i>, the tone of debate has fallen 
to the worst standards of the Cold War.... We are enjoined to think in manichean 
terms&#8217;. Now this also seems to me to be pre-emption - again, perhaps, 
unconscious - of a different kind. I must remind you where <i>The Poverty of 
Theory</i> came from. It came from the socialist and Marxist tradition, in 
particular from the tradition of the <i>Reasoner</i>. All of the comrades 
associated with that tradition lived through the worst years of the ideological 
Cold War, and we were at the receiving end of it. When our own crisis came, in 
1956 or thereabouts, not one person in that tradition of Marxist historiography 
ran to <i>Encounter</i>, lamented that our God had failed, or called for the 
wholesale rejection of the Marxist tradition. Nor did we quit the socialist 
movement: there are at least four members of the board of the old <i>New 
Reasoner</i> (John Saville, Dorothy Thompson, Peter Worsley and myself) at this 
workship today. I mention these points because I think they argue an entitlement 
in us - when we confront what appear to be over-familiar idealist deformations, 
as well as large and guilty silences, in what passes as a Marxism - to argue the 
points, within the left, sharply and with force. <i>The Poverty of Theory</i> 
was a political intervention, coming from a socialist publishing house and 
addressed to the left.</p>

<p class="fst">We cannot discuss Marxist theory today, carefully and 
respectfully, while holding the hand over the fact that in huge territories of 
the world power is endorsed by a state-orthodoxy called Marxism, which is 
profoundly authoritarian and hostile to libertarian values. Those who ask us not 
to mention such matters too loudly, in the name of solidarity on the &#8216;left&#8217;, are 
simply asking to be left in the possession of the field - to define what the 
&#8216;left&#8217; is - and using solidarity as a gag. They are also reassuring us, without 
permitting an inspection, that there could not possibly be any <i>theoretical</i> 
component in the disasters of real socialist history.</p>

<p class="fst">Now I find this very strange. Because the same theorists are very 
sensitive, and sometimes enlightening, in showing us the way in which 
capitalist, racist or sexist ideologies reproduce themselves by theoretical 
means. But for some reason &#8216;Marxism&#8217; is proclaimed as utterly exempt from 
similar &#8216;protocols&#8217;: it is improper even to suggest that Stalinist ideology, or 
authoritarian, elitist, inhumane and philistine attitudes could reproduce 
themselves within Marxism by theoretical means. A very special privilege, an 
immunity from ideology, is claimed. Well, I have argued otherwise in <i>The 
Poverty of Theory</i>: I have argued that &#8216;the Moment of Theory&#8217; had ideological 
origins, that structuralism has enabled vast areas of guilty silence to be kept 
as to Stalinist practice, and I have even argued, more carefully than some 
critics suppose, the difference between Stalinism as a historical eventuation 
and Stalinism as an existing ideological tradition. I have been trying to 
establish libertarian positions, not just on a basis of moralism or utopian 
aspiration, but at a level of theory: and such a splitting-apart of 
authoritarian and libertarian elements within a common theoretical tradition 
cannot be effected without a polemic which must, on occasion, appear &#8216;manichean&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst">I will agree, however, that the indiscriminate hurling around of 
accusations of &#8216;Stalinism&#8217; is no more helpful to thought or practice than any 
other sort of indiscriminate boo word: racism, empiricism, sexism or humanism. 
Discrimination is what matters. What matters is to explore those large and 
guilty areas of silence which Althusserianism walled off with its own boo words 
and its own specious appeals to a solidarity of the &#8216;left&#8217; which left its 
practitioners in command of every wall. If Gareth Stedman Jones means that 
&#8216;Stalinism&#8217; is a term so heavy with emotion that it cannot be used for 
discrimination, then - if he will also agree that the other walls must be pulled 
down which have for too long protected that historical and theoretical object 
from analysis - I will attend to his objection with care and respect.</p>

<p class="fst">Some more refusals, very much more briefly. They chiefly concern 
Stuart Hall&#8217;s article. What puzzles me about this is that it carries a whole set 
of assertions as to my positions which are not founded upon any careful 
attention to my text. Of course I see a problem in empiricism. I certainly do 
not reject filiations between law and class rule in the twentieth-century - 
although.</p>

<p class="fst">I do not always see these as he does, I have argued the 
complexity of these, and I have certainly not argued &#8216;<i>contra</i> the left, <i>
tout court</i>&#8217;. I certainly do not reject concepts of structure: I am at pains 
to distinguish such valid conceptual and heuristic organisations from 
structuralism. I am astonished to find that ideology is an &#8216;absent category&#8217; 
from my work.</p>

<p class="fst">I am also astonished to find that I present values and norms as 
&#8216;transcendental human values <i>outside</i> of real historical conditions&#8217;, a 
point which also appears in Simon Clarke&#8217;s generous and historically informed 
critique &#8216;Abstract and Ahistorical Moralism&#8217;, <i>History Workshop Journal 8</i>, 
p. 154. This seems to me to indicate a serious closure or refusal which still 
marks the Marxist tradition. For what I actually say about this - &#8216;A materialist 
examination of values must situate itself, not by idealist propositions, but in 
the face of culture&#8217;s material abode: the people&#8217;s way of life, and, above all, 
their productive and familial relationships&#8217; (<i>Poverty of Theory</i>, p. 238) 
- allows no warrant for this dismissal. This continues to be, as in my revised <i>
William Morris</i>, and my ongoing work on eighteenth-century customs, a central 
piece of my own historical <i>and theoretical</i> engagement: neither abstract, 
nor a-historical, nor transcendental, but contextual and materialist.</p>

<p class="fst">I am surprised to find that, in my attempts to define the 
historical discipline, with its own logic or discourse of the proof, I have 
given the impression that all &#8216;History&#8217; is somehow immune from ideological 
intrusion and may stand above other disciplines as a &#8216;judge&#8217;. And, finally, I am 
surprised to find that readers still think that I have proposed some 
&#8216;culturalist&#8217; theory of class, in which people float free of economic 
determinations and discover themselves in terms of some immaterial 
consciousness. (I have written about this, to different effect, repeatedly: most 
recently in <i>Social History</i>, Vol. 3, no. 2: but see also the excellent 
study by R. W. Connell, &#8216;A Critique of the Althusserian Approach to Class&#8217;, <i>
Theory and Society</i>, 8, 1979.)</p>

<p class="fst">I am not attempting to refuse all criticism. I am refusing the 
category of &#8216;culturalism&#8217; (which I see as one more wall of silence), and 
inaccurate criticism. As for the general debate in HWJ I have found much in it 
that is constructive, and clearly find many points made by McLelland, Tim Mason, 
Clarke, Williams and Stedman Jones to be helpful. The clarification of concepts 
in <i>Capital</i> and respecting the Marxist notation of the capitalist mode of 
production is very certainly helpful; and I am more than willing to accept (and 
welcome) correction and clarification in economic theory, where my work has 
obvious weaknesses.</p>

<p class="fst">There are still certain difficulties in this exchange. That is, 
it is not helpful to criticise me or Genovese for not having written out 
different versions of <i>Capital</i>, when our objects of study and our 
particular skills were not those of Marx! We have both been working in a Marxist 
tradition of historiography, supported by the skills of colleagues in adjacent 
disciplines, and chastised or enlightened by the criticism. When writing the <i>
Making</i>, whose central object of study was a moment of class formation, I 
compensated for my own weakness in economic theory by borrowing heavily from 
that tradition (Marx or Dobb) or by exchanges with colleagues (John Saville, 
Hobsbawm and others). I am sure that weaknesses remain, which merit criticism. 
But I am distinctly unhappy - <i>especially in relation to Marist historiography 
-</i> at this tendency towards a cult of the methodological individual, whose 
themes, objects of study and characteristic weaknesses (or even strengths) must 
be prematurely defined as identifying an absolutist position. It is not only 
that this puts upon an individual&#8217;s work more than it can bear (unless one is a 
Marx, which none of us are), thereby distracting attention from equally 
significant adjacent work within a common tradition. It is also that it erects 
walls <i>within</i> a tradition, which need not be there. In fact, in the 
British Marxist tradition of historiography these walls just have not existed: 
colleagues of much harder - even &#8216;economistic&#8217; - emphasis have argued with me, 
and I have argued back, and we have both learned from the exchange, just as the 
very different traditions of the Society for the Study of Labour History, <i>
Past and Present</i>, <i>Social History</i>, <i>New Left Review</i> and the 
History Workshop engage in fruitful exchanges today. If I have resisted 
structuralism so vigorously &#8212; and refuse with vigour the attempt to label a 
whole ongoing tradition of work as &#8216;culturalism&#8217; - it is exactly because we 
should not allow these absolutist walls to be built and to interrupt our 
exchanges.</p>

<p class="fst">The other difficulty in the exchange is that some of the 
contributors, while making valuable criticisms, appear to wish to reconstruct 
Marxism-as-system (Tim Mason of course is a warm exception) - and sometimes (as 
Gareth Stedman Jones suggests, <i>HWJ</i> 8) a system reconstructed in their own 
image. This is a difficult distance to argue across, but I hope that we can 
continue to do so. A characteristic of his notion of Marxism-as-system is an 
insistent attribution of heuristic priority, not only in an epochal sense, but 
in every detail of method, to the mode of production: the notion persists that, 
once this can be really theorised and put together with all the bits (including 
aesthetics and the common law) in the right places, all problems of explanation 
are ended; indeed, one might then not have to research history at all, because 
the theory would anticipate the results. I have explained, and I hope with some 
care, in <i>The Poverty of Theory</i>, why I reject this notion of &#8216;theory&#8217; - in 
explaining everything, in one complex gulp, it leaves the actual history 
unexplained.</p>

<p class="fst">This is not, of course, a question of whether we need <i>theory</i> 
or not. Do I need to say that the title of my book did not invoke the 
jettisoning of all theory, any more than Marx, in writing <i>The Poverty of 
Philosophy</i>, intended to jettison all philosophy? My critique was of Theory, 
of the notion that it could all, somehow, be put together, as a system, by 
theoretical means. In every moment of our work we certainly need theory - 
whether in defining problems of the mode of production, or micro-economics, or 
the family, or culture or the state - and we need research which is both 
empirically and theoretically informed, and the theorised interrogation of what 
this research finds.</p>

<p class="fst">Two self-critical points. The first arises generally, but 
particularly in Gavin Kitching&#8217;s position paper. What surprised me in Kitching 
was his assertion that I collapse exploitation into the <i>experience</i> of 
exploitation, reject material causes going on &#8216;behind the back&#8217; of 
consciousness, suppose consciousness to be in some way &#8216;autonomous&#8217; of any 
material determinations, and suppose that class arises in such ways. This is to 
repeat a similar line of critique in Johnson&#8217;s original article.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
This stands so much against the whole tenor of my work (and that of the older 
Marxist tradition of historiography) that I must suppose that the reading arises 
from a lack of clarity in my own definitions.</p>

<p class="fst">Some of the fault lies with my critics. They persistently refuse 
to examine seriously the discriminations which Raymond Williams and I have made 
as to determination in its sense of &#8216;setting limits&#8217; and &#8216;exerting pressures&#8217;, 
and which I have made as to &#8216;junction-concepts&#8217;. But the other part may lie in 
my own use of &#8216;experience&#8217;. For experience is exactly what makes the junction 
between culture and not-culture, lying half within social being, half within 
social consciousness. We might perhaps call these experiences I - lived 
experience - and II - perceived experience.</p>

<p class="fst">Many contemporary epistemologists and sociologists, when they 
hear the word &#8216;experience&#8217;, immediately reach for experience II. That is, they 
move directly to what Marx called social consciousness. They then go on to show 
that experience II is a very imperfect and falsifying medium, corrupted by 
ideological intrusions, and so on. They even read us little epistemological 
lessons, to show that different persons experience the same thing differently, 
that experience is organised according to presuppositions and within 
ideologically-formed categories, etc. Which is all so. But this is exactly why I 
was so heavy about the distinctive'discipline, the discourse of the proof, of 
the historian. Historians within the Marxist tradition - as well as many without 
- have for so long been using the term &#8216;experience&#8217; in a different way that I 
had come to assume this usage so deeply myself that in <i>The Poverty of Theory</i> 
I did not adequately explain it.</p>

<p class="fst">What we see - and study - in our work are repeated events within 
&#8216;social being&#8217; - such events being indeed often consequent upon material causes 
which go on behind the back of consciousness or intention - which inevitably do 
and must give rise to lived experience, experience I, which do not instantly 
break through as &#8216;reflections&#8217; into experience II, but whose pressure upon the 
whole field of consciousness cannot be indefinitely diverted, postponed, 
falsified or suppressed by ideology. I gestured in <i>The Poverty of Theory</i> 
(p 11) to the kind of collective experience, within social being, which I mean:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Experience walks in without knocking at the door, and 
announces deaths, crises of subsistence, trench warfare, unemployment, 
inflation, genocide. People starve: their survivors think in new ways about the 
market. People are imprisoned: in prison they meditate in new ways about the 
law.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">And I argued:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;changes take place within social being, which give rise to 
changed <i>experience</i>: and this experience is <i>determining,</i> in the 
sense that it exerts pressures upon existent social consciousness, proposes new 
questions, and affords much of the material which the more elaborated 
intellectual exercises are about.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">How else can a materialist explain historical change with any 
rationality at all? How else, at a time like our own, are we to suppose that 
there can ever be any human remedy to the hegemonic domination of the mind, the 
false descriptions of reality reproduced daily by the media? Experience I is in 
eternal friction with imposed consciousness, and, as it breaks through, we, who 
fight in all the intricate vocabularies and disciplines of experience II, are 
given moments of openness and opportunity before the mould of ideology is 
imposed once more.</p>

<p class="fst">The second self-criticism is too complex to work out, except with 
pain and at length. I doubt whether I am competent to attempt it. When he had 
read <i>Poverty of Theory</i> Hans Medick wrote to me to argue that, when I 
offered to establish the objectivity both of the historical discipline and of 
its object - the finished historical process, with its pattern of (ultimately 
unknowable) causation - I had lurched towards that positivism which, at other 
points, I attempt to confront. I had put Popper out at the front door, and then 
sneaked him in again at the back. In short, by placing fact here and value 
there, I had opened my argument to serious error.</p>

<p class="fst">I sent a grumpy answer to Hans Medick, but on reflection I think 
that he is right, or partially right. The fact is - and David Selborne in his 
paper makes this point<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> - we are 
all making ferocious or lofty epistemological faces, but most of us, especially 
in Britain, are the merest novices in philosophy. A training by way of Althusser 
(who himself makes gross logical blunders) or by way of a critique of Althusser 
is not an adequate substitute for a more rigourous preparation. In my present 
view, the distinction offered in <i>The Poverty of Theory</i> remains valid, in 
the sense that the historical discipline (its &#8216;discourse of the proof&#8217;) 
presupposes that an encounter with objective evidence is what is at issue: and 
particular techniques and a particular disciplinary logic have been devised to 
that end. But I concede also that the historian, in every moment of his or her 
work, is a value-formed being, who cannot, when proposing problems or 
interrogating evidence, in fact operate in this value-free way. Medick considers 
that Habermas has disclosed the nature of this problem and that we should attend 
more carefully to his writing. I hope that Medick will write further and assist 
us through this difficult point.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, what, oh what, are we to do with our good friend Philip 
Corrigan? Does he <i>know</i> what he has written? Philip Corrigan, the enemy of 
theoretical &#8216;terrorism' - how on earth did his typewriter encompass that 
sentence, the most defeatist and terrorist of all? &#8216;It seems to me time, to be 
honest, to recognise that History is a cultural form engaged in practices of 
regulation just like Law &#8212; it is one of the ways in which the subordinated are 
encouraged to agree to their own confinement.&#8217; That <i>is</i> what he has 
written. Not that History can <i>sometimes</i> be that: not that this is an 
ideological deformation or &#8216;capture&#8217; of History, which may go on, in certain 
academic circles, or in school curricula, or even as popular myth. This point 
should certainly be taken. But that History is ... just that. Hindess and Hirst 
come back! All is forgiven! no blow you ever struck was as unkind as this!</p>

<p class="fst">No intellectual discipline or art is a cultural form engaged only 
in practices or regulation, not even law. As Corrigan, of course, well knows. 
History is a form within which we fight, and many have fought before us. Nor are 
we alone when we fight there. For the past is not just dead, inert, confining; 
it carries signs and evidences also of creative resources which can sustain the 
present and prefigure possibility.</p>
