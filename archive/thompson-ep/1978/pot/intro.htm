<h2><a name="h1">Introduction</a></h2>

<p class="fst">This essay is a rarity among Edward&#8217;s published work. Although he 
was throughout his life interested in the philosophy of history and in various 
theoretical formulations, he concerned himself with these mainly in private 
reading and private discussion. As a historian and as a writer on political 
matters he was concerned to examine particular problems rather than to enunciate 
overarching general principles. He approached his subject matter certainly with 
expectations - even assumptions - which were to be tested against the evidence. 
Such prior conceptions often demanded new kinds of evidence, and one of Edward&#8217;s 
contributions to historiography was that he, along with others of his 
generation, opened up new sources for the study of past societies as well as 
interrogating many existing sources in new ways. He came from a tradition of 
Marxist historiography, but always preferred to refer to a tradition rather than 
a system. Towards the end of his life he ceased to consider himself a &#8216;Marxist&#8217; 
- not because he no longer respected the tradition, but because the term had 
acquired a quasi-religious connotation which seemed to involve arguments which 
were irrelevant to the fruitful development of the positive elements in the 
tradition. He preferred to call himself a &#8216;historical materialist&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst">Why then did he write this essay? He had read the works of Louis 
Althusser and found very little in them to affect his work. There have been 
numerous proponents of closed systems in religious thought and at the fringes of 
philosophy whose work has not concerned historians to any great extent. The 
basic platonic mode of thought by which human endeavour is to be judged by its 
degree of approximation to a pre-existing ideal is to be found in most system of 
religious thought in which the teacher, by exegetic or hermeneutic means 
extracts the truth from some form of holy writ. That there have been elements of 
such an approach in some forms of Marxist writing cannot be denied, but on the 
whole the historians who were writing in the tradition in the fifties and 
sixties were more interested in Marx as a major intellectual influence than as a 
prophet. When Althusser appeared on the scene he made little impact on 
practising historians. For some reason however, he suddenly became a major force 
among graduate students and some young historians and literary scholars. Most 
historians would have been prepared to wait for the new influence to demonstrate 
its validity in the production of innovative work in history; not only did this 
not happen, but Althusser&#8217;s followers - even some of the historians among them - 
began to declare that history was a non-discipline and that its study was of no 
value.</p>

<p class="fst">It was the influence that Althusser&#8217;s writings were having on 
scholarship that made Edward take on the uncongenial task of putting the case 
for history against his closed system. We had been attending a series of 
international seminars on Social History in Paris, and found that scholars who 
shared our outlook in France, Germany and the United States were having the same 
experience. Edward read up all the relevant published work and packed volumes 
and notes into a car and we set out to spend a fortnight out of the tourist 
season on the shore of Lake Garda. We walked in the hills each morning, had 
lunch and then spent the afternoon and evening writing. So this essay was 
actually written in two weeks of intensive work, being argued about and 
corrected as it went along. It was intended as a polemical statement and written 
for a particular moment.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course it produced responses. Some of these emerged at an 
extraordinary evening at a History Workshop conference in Oxford in December 
1979. This was for some reason held in a dimly-lit ruined building, and had been 
set up as a discussion. It ended up however as an emotionally-charged event 
whose repercussions continued for months if not for years. Unfortunately the 
paper to which Edward was replying which had particularly annoyed him when he 
saw it a short time before the debate, seems to have been completely re-written 
for the published version.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> 
Nevertheless, the point to which he took particular exception is explained in 
his published reply - his categorisation as a &#8216;culturalist'. At the end of the 
evening a leading History Workshop character asked whether he would continue to 
publish relevant material. Edward replied that he thought he would not be 
publishing much of anything for a while, since he felt that his time would be 
taken up in trying to organise opposition to the sighting of cruise missiles in 
Britain. The answer was &#8216;cruise <i>what</i> Edward?&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">As a definitive work of &#8216;theory&#8217; the essay has many shortcomings. 
It is much more a defence of history than an exposition of an alternative to 
Althusser&#8217;s views of Marxism. Edward saw the dispute not only as a scholarly 
one, but as the tackling of a set of intellectual assumptions which in politics 
could be taken to justify Stalinism and the discredited methods of the old 
Communist parties. Readers of Althusser&#8217;s autobiography, a strangely haunting 
volume which is now available in English as well as French<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> 
may feel that the gulf between the two writers lies not only in their different 
intellectual approaches but in their whole lives. Perhaps one may even use the 
despised word 'experience&#8217;?</p>
