<h3>Final Installment</h3>

<h4>The Final Answer to Coughlin</h4>

<p class="fst">Democratic capitalism is doomed in the United States.</p>

<p>It can offer nothing but war, unemployment, misery, death.</p>

<p>In its desperate dying struggles capitalism will attempt anything to survive.</p>

<p>That &#8220;<em>anything&#8221;</em> is <em>fascism</em>.</p>

<p>The whole fascist movement is built upon the collapse of &#8220;democracy&#8221; and complete scorn and rejection of democratic institutions, except where they an be utilized to further fascism.</p>

<p>The entire working class, employed and unemployed, youth and aged, and their brothers who toil on the farms, must unite in common struggle to throw out the present government which represents the capitalists and place in power a government that will <em>represent the workers and the farmers</em>.</p>

<p>First step in placing labor&#8217;s own government in power is to organize labor&#8217;s OWN POLITICAL PARTY.</p>

<p>Every worker must begin <em>thinking</em> INDEPENDENT LABOR PARTY, <em>talking</em> INDEPENDENT LABOR PARTY, <em>organising</em> INDEPENDENT LABOR PARTY.</p>

<p>This must be done immediately.</p>

<p>There is not a moment to lose.</p>

<p>ORGANIZE AN INDEPENDENT LABOR PARTY.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>The Socialist Order of Plenty</h4>

<p class="fst">Democratic capitalism is doomed.</p>

<p>Although it loaded them with chains and branded them with irons, even a slave state could feed and clothe its slaves. But democratic capitalism can provide neither jobs nor food for those who toil.</p>

<p>It deserves no other fate but to be crushed by socialist revolution.</p>

<p>Clean away the rubbish of democratic capitalism!</p>

<p>GOOD RIDDANCE!</p>

<p>The productive system is ready to pour out fabulous riches.</p>

<p>Open up the vaults and the granaries! Open up the bursting warehouses for every working member of society!</p>

<p>Harvest and distribute the crops that ripen in the fields!</p>

<p>Open the idle factories and man the machines that will produce undreamed quantities of wealth!</p>

<p>An end to the blind alley of despair in America! Fight with the Socialist Workers Party for the SOCIALIST ORDER OF PLENTY!</p>
