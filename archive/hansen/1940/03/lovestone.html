<p class="fst">Not the least vociferous among Stalin&rsquo;s attorneys up until
the time the Dewey Commission investigated the Moscow Trials were the
Lovestoneites. They defended Stalin&rsquo;s hideous frame-ups. They
defended Stalin&rsquo;s murder of the entire generation that led the
October revolution. The only thing about Stalinism they didn&rsquo;t
defend was the refusal of the rotten and corrupt Comintern to
reinstate them as members.</p>

<p>After an embarrassed silence following the hearings of the Dewey
Commission, they finally spoke of the Moscow Trials as frame-ups and
sanctimoniously raised their eyes heavenward at the crimes of
Stalinism. But Jay Lovestone and his cohorts never offered anyone the
slightest explanation for this sudden repentance from supporting
Stalinist morality.</p>

<p>This background sheds a grim light upon the article entitled
<em>Trotskyites Put Forward Own Super-&lsquo;Ham-and-Eggs&rsquo; Plan</em>,
printed in the March 2 issue of their official organ, the <strong>Workers
Age</strong>.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The policy of both the Stalinists and the
Trotskyists is of supporting the Ham and Eggs movement in
California,&rdquo; declares this article, &ldquo;has nothing in
common with socialism. It only indicates that again and once again
the Stalinists and Trotskyists have something in common &ndash; an
unprincipled and demagogic appeal to the backwardness and illusions
of the masses.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Naturally the <strong>Workers Age</strong> fails to mention the actual
circumstances which dictated our critical support of &ldquo;Ham and
Eggs.&rdquo; There was a mass movement in California for social
security, actually mobilizing hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of
desperate, poverty-stricken people. The <strong>Workers Age</strong> didn&rsquo;t
mention that the demands of these masses were entirely justified and
reasonable. It didn&rsquo;t mention that the inability of capitalism
to feed and clothe and shelter these people gave their demands a
revolutionary significance. It didn&rsquo;t mention that a
revolutionary party has the duty to support such demands of the
masses &ndash; although sharply criticising the unrealistic means
proposed to attain them &ndash; in order to direct these demands
toward their only real means of achievement &ndash; socialism. It
didn&rsquo;t mention that above all a revolutionary party stays with
the masses and goes through their experiences with them, precisely in
order to hasten their development toward socialism.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Attacks Our &ldquo;Transitional&rdquo; Program</h4>

<p class="fst">Lovestone&rsquo;s organ however does not stop at these
distortions. Something weightier is needed to &ldquo;prove&rdquo;
that Trotskyism is but another manifestation of Stalinism. To this
end the <strong>Workers Age</strong> points to the first thing on the first
page of the <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>: the program which the Socialist
Workers Party proposes Congress should enact as EMERGENCY legislation
for the relief of those in dire need &ndash; $10,000,000,000 for the
unemployed, a 30 hour week at minimum pay of $30, disability and old
age pensions of $30 a week, and $3,000,000,000 for the youth.</p>

<p>This program is attacked by arguments that Calvin Coolidge would
have heartily seconded. They add up to this: our program is
economically impossible, and therefore &ldquo;unprincipled and
demagogic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the aid of an adding machine the <strong>Workers Age</strong> proceeds
to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; this: the Roosevelt administration doesn&rsquo;t
get enough income from its system of taxation; the national income is
too low under capitalism in its death agony; hence, it concludes,
there is not enough money available at present to foot the costs of
our program.</p>

<p>In addition to reading us this adding machine tape, the <strong>Workers
Age</strong> appeals to the truth expounded in the labor movement ever
since the <strong>Communist Manifesto</strong> was written almost a hundred
years ago, that &ldquo;only through the establishment of a socialist
society is it possible to bring about any substantial and lasting
improvement in the conditions of the masses.&rdquo; We agree with
this truth one hundred per cent. It is precisely the aim expressed in
this truth which motivates every word written in the <strong>Socialist
Appeal</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What Is the Road to Socialism?</h4>

<p class="fst">But that doesn&rsquo;t happen to be the question at issue. What is
at issue and what must be answered by whoever would lead the
revolutionary movement in the United States is: How achieve this end?</p>

<p>Inasmuch as we could not find a single slogan in the Lovestone
organ calling for armed insurrection in the United States or even so
much as a polite bid for revolutionary terror against Ford,
Rockefeller, Morgan, and the rest of the Sixty Families who dominate
American industry, we take it that the Lovestoneites do not believe
the American working class has yet been convinced that revolution is
the only way out of the capitalist system of war, hunger, and
fascism.</p>

<p>Can the workers be convinced of the necessity of revolution by
calling for armed insurrection tomorrow? The Lovestoneite article
seems to imply that anything less than that is an &ldquo;unprincipled
and demagogic appeal to the backwardness and illusions of the
masses.&rdquo; Then out of their own mouths the Lovestoneites are
proved demagogic and unprincipled, for in that very article they
include the main plank of the Lovestone Ham-and-Eggs program: &ldquo;Keep
America Out of War.&rdquo; Is this program realizable under
capitalism? Can America be kept out of war so long as the capitalist
system endures? We say no, and we do not have to appeal to an adding
machine to prove our contention &ndash; today&rsquo;s headlines are
demonstrating it. Our slogans, on the contrary, such as turning all
war funds over to the unemployed, would destroy capitalism. But there
is a world of difference between being for these demands without
labelling them impossible of complete achievement under capitalism,
and the Lovestone-Norman Thomas propaganda that it is possible to
have peace under capitalism. Their &ldquo;Keep America Out of War&rdquo;
committees thus directly propagate a harmful lie, while our
campaigning for the popular referendum on war specifically refrains
from promising that it will keep America out of war. The distinction
between us and Lovestone-Thomas on this question is the distinction
between reformism and revolutionary Marxism.</p>

<p>The crime which the Lovestoneites commit in creating illusions
about peace under capitalism is the one they accuse us of in
advocating our economic demands. But we are not at all guilty of
their crime. Nowhere do we promise that these demands are compatible
with capitalism. We create no such illusions. These demands are,
indeed, a &ldquo;transition&rdquo;, a bridge, to a full socialist
program.</p>
