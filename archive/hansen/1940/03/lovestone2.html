<hr />
<p class="fst">In his article published in the March 2 issue of the <strong>Workers
Age</strong>, official organ of the Lovestoneites, Mr. Graham places the
label &ldquo;Trotskyite Super &lsquo;Ham-and-Eggs&rsquo; Plan&rdquo;
upon the emergency demands which the Socialist Workers Party suggests
the labor movement make upon Congress. These demands include the
following immediate legislation: $10,000,000,000 for the unemployed,
a 30-hour week at minimum pay of $30, disability and old age pensions
of $30 a week, and $3,000,000,000 for the youth.</p>

<p>Such demands, claims Mr. Graham, are not feasible under capitalism
and therefore should not be raised by the labor movement. He attempts
to prove this by pointing to the national income and the federal
income and then deducing that these sums are not large enough to
carry out the demands of the suggested program. Such arguments, we
note in passing, are the stock in trade of all the attorneys of the
capitalist system from the Chamber of Commerce right down to the most
miserable pettifogging labor lieutenant of Wall Street.</p>

<p>(Mr. Graham draws the moral that our suggesting such demands
indicates &ldquo;again and once again the Stalinists and Trotskyists
have something in common &ndash; an unprincipled and demagogic appeal
to the backwardness and illusions of the masses.&rdquo; This from the
Lovestoneites who white washed the Moscow Trials and who are now
shouting that it is possible &ndash; under capitalism! &ndash; to
&ldquo;Keep America Out of War.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Are these emergency demands feasible? Is there not enough wealth
available in the United States to provide food, clothing, shelter,
and jobs for everyone immediately? Let us see.</p>

<h4>It Can Be Done!</h4>

<p class="fst">If it is merely a question of raising the national income or of
providing the necessary funds which Mr. Graham believes the present
federal income could not provide (under the present tax structure
controlled by Wall Street), here are some practical proposals which
if carried out would immediately make possible not only the granting
of the above emergency demands but far bigger and more important
needs of the poverty-stricken levels of the populace:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the idle factories and run them at full capacity,
providing jobs for all the unemployed in productive enterprises at
trade union wages. This would immediately raise the national income,
about which Mr. Graham worries, to many times its present figure.
True, some of the coupon-clippers might have to take a factory job,
but what they lost in dividends from their stock would be made up
hundreds of&lsquo;times over by what the workers gained in wages.
And who, aside from the Lovestoneites, would concern themselves
about the whining objections of the stockholders who now live by
exploiting and plundering the poor?<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Expropriate the parasitic Sixty Families who now dominate and
control the nation&rsquo;s industries and who operate them for their
private benefit at the expense of the rest of the population. This
would immediately provide far more than the amount of funds
necessary to carry out the proposed emergency program &ndash; thus
answering the Lovestoneite objection that the federal income is
inadequate to supply the funds we call for. True, the Sixty Families
would find it somewhat distasteful but again who, aside from the
Lovestoneites, feels any tenderness for these completely useless and
decayed aristocrats of high society?<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Run the national industries under the control of factory
committees elected by the workers. If the workers themselves
controlled the industries, even though they were still &ldquo;owned&rdquo;
by the capitalists they could be trusted to see to it that the
productive system was run at maximum efficiency and that all the
secret bookkeeping, the secret deals, the swindles, and frauds which
now bleed the enterprises of the nation would be ended. Under this
control, the workers could even guarantee their former bosses $30 a
week (if they worked 30 hours a week) or a pension of $30 a week if
they were old or disabled. Under such control of industry by the
workers there would be a tremendous leap in production that would
immediately raise the national income and the federal income far
above the present figures.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">Any one of the above three proposals, or all three taken together,
if carried out, would provide the &lsquo;answer to Mr. Graham&rsquo;s
objections that there aren&rsquo;t enough funds available. And as a
starter, just to relieve the worst cases now awaiting the pleasure of
the relief authorities, how about the approximately $18,000,000,000
in pure gold now lying idle in the vaults at Fort Knox? Why not put
this money to work relieving human distress? Why not distribute it
immediately as a bonus to the unemployed, the underpaid, the aged,
the youth, and the disabled while Congress gets the machine greased
to put into effect the proposals which would have a more permanent
effect?</p>

<p>To add up our proposed demands on a capitalist adding machine as
the Lovestoneites have done &ndash; in an attempt to prove solely on
the basis of the present national income under capitalism in its
death agony and the present tax structure as controlled by Wall
Street that these demands are not feasible &ndash; is sheer
blockheadedness, an unprincipled and demagogic appeal to the
backwardness and illusions of the masses.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Masses Are Not Doomed!</h4>

<p class="fst">We cannot agree with the implications of Mr. Graham&rsquo;s
article that the unemployed, the youth, the aged, and the disabled
are doomed to suffer without hope of any gains whatsoever until
socialism is securely established. A militant fight on the part of
the masses for emergency appropriations by the present Congress would
bring greater returns than even those outlined in the program carried
on our front page masthead, if the militant fight mobilized the
entire working class for the demands.</p>

<p>This program, we are the first to point out, does not offer a
permanent solution. We have never claimed that it would. Only
socialism can do that. Our entire program is designed to reach that
permanent solution, to provide the oppressed masses with a program
which will show them the road to that permanent solution.</p>

<p>But there is absolutely ho reason for anyone in a land as rich as
this going hungry, ill-clothed, or shelterless while the toilers are
organizing for socialism. Emergency appropriations by Congress are in
order to relieve the present nationwide distress immediately. It is
high time that the labor movement pitted its colossal power in a
struggle for this elementary right.</p>
