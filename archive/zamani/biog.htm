<p>Shahrokh Zamani was born in Tabriz, the capital of Iran's East Azerbaijan Province, in 1963. He was a painter and decorator by trade and was active in the <em>Committee to Pursue the Establishment of Free Labour Organisations</em> in Iran and attempts to re-launch the painters' union.</p>
<p>Shahrokh Zamani was arrested in Tabriz on June 4th 2011, and without being   made aware of the charges against him, was sentenced to 11 years in   prison. During his second hunger strike, which lasted 50 days, he lost   24 kilograms in weight. The Iranian regime would not even allow Shahrokh   to attend his mother&rsquo;s funeral or his only daughter&rsquo;s wedding. The   particularly harsh treatment of Shahrokh Zamani was undoubtedly due to   his uncompromising belief in the Leninist concept of the vanguard party   of the proletariat.</p>
<p>On September 13th 2015 he died in Karaj's Rejai Shahr prison under suspicious circumstances. His cell-mates have said that he had &ldquo;black and bruised&rdquo; areas on his body.</p>
