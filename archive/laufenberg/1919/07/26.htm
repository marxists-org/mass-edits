<h2>Heinrich Laufenberg</h2>
<h1>The Hamburg Revolution</h1>
<h3>1919</h3>

<h3>Preface</h3>

<p class="fst">This small volume owes its existence to the editorial committee 
of the <i>Archive of Social Sciences and Social Legislation</i>, who invited me 
to explain the role and importance of the council system. I have restricted 
myself to a historically faithful account, based on the proceedings and policies 
of the Hamburg Council and, given its general interest, I publish this work 
without any substantial modifications in order to make it accessible to a wider 
public.</p>

<p class="fst">What follows includes that part of the events in question in 
which I was personally involved. The events of the days between November 6 and 
11 are therefore not treated here. The uprising of the Kiel sailors only 
acquired importance as a result of the rebellion in Hamburg on the 6<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, 
which was itself made possible by the fact that a massive peaceful 
demonstration, organized by the USPD on the Heiligengeist fields, was joined by 
the insurrection of revolutionary troops under a radical leftist leadership. The 
fact that the military power completely collapsed within the region of the Ninth 
Army Corps, which was the only military formation which could have opposed the 
revolt, was the signal for revolution throughout the empire. Since I lack their 
source documentation, these events, which occurred under the leadership of the 
radical left, can only be explained in their full significance by the 
participants themselves. My comrade Wolffheim, who played an outstanding role in 
the revolutionary uprising as well as in its preparation, will also have his say 
on the matter.</p>

Hamburg-Altrahlstedt, July 26, 1919.</p>

<p class="fst">The council movement, which in Germany as elsewhere originated in 
the revolution, has not yet been appreciated in all of its details, nor has its 
development reached a conclusion, by any means. The council movement is at the 
very heart of the struggles between parties, and is simultaneously the goal and 
the means in these struggles. Faced with the current impossibility of subjecting 
this vast historical process to critical judgment, only one way now lies open 
for scientific and political orientation: the description of the historical 
events, in particularly important locations, and the exposition of the principle 
positions which distinguished the permutations of <i>political</i> practice. 
Given the importance of the urban region of the lower Elbe for all of Germany, 
the delineation of the experiences and peculiarities of the council systems in 
Hamburg, Altona and their environs will permit us to draw a series of 
conclusions concerning the general course of events and the basic outlines of 
the German council system.</p>

<p class="fst">A few days after the victory of the sailors&#8217; revolt in Kiel, the 
revolutionary movement arose in Hamburg, giving the signal for revolution in the 
rest of Germany. The struggle in Hamburg itself was brief. While the military 
was withdrawing in a none-too-glorious manner, a provisional council of workers 
and soldiers was formed, which distributed a manifesto to the population on 
November 7. The manifesto began with the declaration that the council had taken 
&#8220;the greater part of political power&#8221; into its hands, and warned that the 
highest degree of unity would be required to fulfill the great tasks of the 
future. A series of political measures was then decreed, such as the release of 
all political prisoners, freedom of the press and of speech, and the abolition 
of the censorship of the mail. The essential part of the manifesto was the 
elimination of the old military discipline and of the power of the military 
command structure, which passed into the hands of the Soldiers&#8217; Council. Decent 
treatment of the troops by their superiors, and their personal freedom while 
off-duty, were to be considered by everyone in the military as the standing 
order of the Soldiers&#8217; Councils. In addition, private property was protected and 
the security of the food supply was guaranteed.</p>

<p class="fst">At the beginning of the revolution, a popular assembly gathered 
on the Heiligengeist fields decided to confiscate the old newspaper of the 
Hamburg workers, the <i>Hamburger Echo</i>, and, under the new name of the <i>
Rote Fahne</i>, to put it at the service of the revolution. But this decision 
was soon annulled. After a few days, the old newspaper once again appeared, 
alongside the <i>Rote Fahne</i>, just as the seizure of political power had not 
been completed, which eventually by one means or another fell back into the 
hands of the old authorities. Thanks to the revolution, the Workers and Soldiers 
Council had become the real government in Hamburg, but the old Senate continued 
to function after its own fashion right alongside the Council.</p>

<p class="fst">An agreement was reached between the various socialist parties, 
which called for the formation of a General Workers Council with approximately 
500 members representing the factories, and, as an executive committee for this 
General Council, a new Workers Council to replace the provisional one, which 
would consist of three delegates each from the old party, the trade unions, the 
USPD and the Party of the Radical Left, respectively, as well as 18 
representatives from the factories. This executive committee&#8217;s presidium, 
referred to as the Workers Council, would be formed by one representative from 
each party mentioned above and the trade unions, and three representatives from 
the factories. The election of the president of this body was carried out like a 
political election. A representative of the radical left group, which would 
later become the communist group, was elected President of the Workers Council; 
this, as well as the general political composition of the Executive Committee, 
was a reflection of the role played by the communist and independent fractions 
in the events of November 6.</p>

<p class="fst">The Executive Committee of the Soldiers Councils, the Commission 
of Fifteen, which later became the Commission of Thirty, formed a consultative 
body together with the Workers Council, with the proviso that only the soldiers 
would be involved in resolving purely military issues. This Commission soon 
created a Commission of Seven as a High Command. The personnel of the Soldiers 
Council had already changed in the first few days. Its composition presented a 
wide range of political views. Bourgeois-democratic ideas prevailed among the 
majority, and some of its members were sympathetic to socialism, but ignorant of 
socialist ideology; only a few were convinced socialists; the only issue that 
concerned all the soldiers was their next military assignment. If the Workers 
Council, with its diversity of parties, had a common basis in the working class, 
such a common foundation did not exist among the representatives of the Soldiers 
Council. This meant that, the more clearly the class position of the Workers 
Council&#8217;s policy was manifested, and the more that different opinions became 
evident, the more the majority of the Soldiers Councils, for the moment, fell 
under the influence of the Workers Council and its communist-independent 
leadership; this became obvious as soon as the Council proceeded to clearly and 
firmly set out its position in respect to the old political powers.</p>

<p class="fst">Hamburg is a city-state. Political power was exercised by its 
Senate. Alongside this Senate, and delimited in its activity by the particular 
rights and prerogatives of the Senate, the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> (City Council) 
existed as a legislative assembly. If the Workers and Soldiers Council wanted to 
pass binding resolutions, it had to replace the Senate and firmly impose its 
legislative power and function on the <i>Bürgerschaft.</i> Both tasks were 
accomplished by means of a manifesto issued on November 12. Based on the fact 
that the revolution had, by establishing a new division of powers, created the 
basis for a new constitution, and therefore a new legal situation, it began with 
the statement that the Workers and Soldiers Council had assumed the exercise of 
political power in the state of Hamburg, and that the Senate and the <i>
Bürgerschaft</i> had ceased to exist; the state of Hamburg would in the future 
form part of the German Peoples&#8217; Republic. Legislative bodies which would be 
created in the near future would decide upon the arrangement of the new 
relations. Peace and order were guaranteed, the functionaries would remain at 
their posts and would continue to be paid, and the assurance was again made that 
private property would be protected.</p>

<p class="fst">The debates which took place in the Council prior to the 
publication of the manifesto were heated and somewhat turbulent, since all the 
representatives of the old party defended a position which was profoundly 
opposed to the new principles set out in the manifesto. Against the idea of 
working class rule, upon which the manifesto was based, they supported the 
demand for popular sovereignty, and proposed a motion to that effect, tailored 
for the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> by the social democratic faction. The motion called 
for the immediate recognition of universal suffrage, with an equal, direct and 
secret vote for the elections to the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> and the other municipal 
governments of the <i>Land</i>, on the basis of a proportional system of 
representation, for all the adult citizens of both sexes; that all special 
elections for privileged status should be abolished, such as those which had 
hitherto been held for the nobility and landowners; that the Senate should be 
elected by the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> for a limited term, and that its membership 
should no longer be restricted to certain professions; and that the city 
administration should be democratized. Immediately after the introduction of the 
new electoral law, elections for the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> should take place, in 
order to deliberate on the new constitution and the new organization of the city 
administration. The Workers and Soldiers Council deliberately and as a matter of 
principle went beyond the motion of the social democratic fraction, in order to 
express, in the most unequivocal manner, the fact that a power shift had taken 
place. The manifesto declared: the Senate and the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> no longer 
exist, the <i>Land</i> of Hamburg will in the future form part of the German 
Peoples&#8217; Republic; but the leadership of the Council was aware of the fact that, 
as they acknowledged during the debate, the communal functions previously 
exercised by the Senate and the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> as community institutions 
still had to be carried out, and that, furthermore, the last word on the future 
of each <i>Land</i> would depend upon the course of events in the Empire as a 
whole, and that in the meantime a declaration concerning the nature of the 
Hamburg <i>Land</i> was necessary. The Council took action on these two matters 
shortly afterwards, as the indisputable voice of the complete sovereignty which 
had passed into the hands of the institutions of the working class; by precisely 
assigning particular tasks, clearly defined and fundamentally distinct from 
their former prerogatives, to the old powers, the new regime showed that it was 
master of the situation and the old powers. Even during the late hours of the 
night, the proclamation was delivered to the newspapers, and was also publicized 
by means of wall posters.</p>

<p class="fst">The first task was to secure the Senate. Since it constituted the 
apex of the administrative apparatus, whose uninterrupted functioning was of 
great interest to the Workers and Soldiers Council, above all so as to prevent 
any problems with the circulation of money, and thus with the payment of family 
subsidies and the wages of workers and government employees. The Council pursued 
the goal of not destroying this apparatus, but of transforming the bureaucracy 
into a popular institution, and securing political control in all of its 
decisive aspects. The transition to the new situation was achieved without any 
friction. In memorable negotiations, the Senate submitted without resistance to 
the existing situation and also declared its willingness to cooperate on the 
basis of the new state of affairs. The Council issued a decree assuring the 
continuity of all administrative authorities and commissions, to which the 
public was to bring its appeals as in the past. A declaration of the manifesto 
of November 12 stated that Hamburg would still exist as a <i>Land</i> and as a 
bearer of financial rights and obligations, until such a time as there should be 
a decision on the scale of the Empire concerning the German constitution. For 
relations between Hamburg and the other German states, with the sole 
responsibility of contracting its obligations and issuing provisional currency, 
the Finance Department would continue to exist in conformity with the laws. Four 
representatives of the Workers and Soldiers Council were incorporated into the 
Senate, and one into the Finance Department, the Council reserving to itself the 
unconditional right to veto any Senate decision. This made the position of the 
Council perfectly clear to the Senate, which in essence preserved only the role 
of a municipal council.</p>

<p class="fst">In parallel with the negotiations with the Senate, negotiations 
took place with representatives of the bourgeois industrialists and the 
retailers, wholesalers and industrial chambers of commerce, as well as the 
banks, which led to the formation of an economic council. These representatives 
of the bourgeoisie also resigned themselves to the <i>fait accompli</i> of the 
shift in political power. Renouncing their demand that the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> 
should be re-established with its old prerogatives, they proposed the 
establishment of a system of local representation. A debate was held in the 
Council on the question of whether the municipal parliament should be composed 
of representatives of the Workers and Soldiers Council, of the councils of white 
collar employees, civil servants, teachers and other professionals, or whether 
the old <i>Bürgerschaft</i> should be provisionally reinstated as a 
representative municipal body. While the representatives of the old party 
without exception wanted to maintain the old institution of the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> 
and to have it meet as a constituent assembly in the near future, the 
representatives of the independent fraction agreed that the old <i>Bürgerschaft</i> 
should be convened, but were opposed to holding elections in the near future, 
since no one could foresee what the next few weeks would bring. The 
representatives of the left radicals, however, proposed that the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> 
should be treated in exactly the same way as the Senate. Since it was at that 
time impossible to completely eliminate the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> and to replace 
it with the General Workers Council due to the danger of international 
repercussions, the Council, by virtue of its revolutionary powers, had to 
provisionally convoke the old <i>Bürgerschaft</i>, within the framework of and 
in accordance with the tasks of municipal representation. The proclamation was 
issued from the very beginning that the universal, equal, direct and secret 
right to vote was established for all representative bodies in the state 
territory of Hamburg. In any event, the Council had to hold elections as soon as 
possible. At this juncture it had the power to determine the character of the 
municipal parliament, and to assign it a set of clearly-defined rights and 
duties, and to prevent political power from falling into the hands of the Senate 
and the <i>Bürgerschaft</i>. The Workers and Soldiers Council assented to this 
proposal, also agreeing, however, with the representatives of the independent 
fraction in regard to holding elections for a constituent municipal assembly. 
While not setting a date for these elections, the Council did agree that they 
should be prepared for as soon as possible. In the exercise of its political 
power, the Council also reserved the right of unconditional veto power over the 
decisions of the <i>Bürgerschaft</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">To assure its effectiveness, the Council had to create its own 
logistical apparatus. Needless to say, from the very first moments of its 
existence, it had at its disposal a well-organized office, and also created a 
press department in order to present its policies outside of Hamburg, which at 
first caused some problems, since this department, although in the hands of the 
Workers and Soldiers Council, was staffed by men of a bourgeois-democratic cast 
of mind, and expressed political views which by no means accorded with those of 
the Council. It took several weeks to remedy this situation, when the Council 
closed this office and formed another with a totally different staff. At its 
first session, the Council had already created three committees: for social 
policy, medicine and transportation. To these, others were soon added: 
committees on external relations and the press, food supply, justice and 
prisons, security and police, public health, construction and housing, 
education, trade, shipping and industry, finance, military affairs and 
indemnifications.</p>

<p class="fst">The most important departments were those which dealt with 
justice, education, trade and industry, social policies and security. The 
justice committee had the job of solving problems which resulted from the 
Council&#8217;s edicts, or their interpretation. It also had to elaborate new norms 
for the penal system and the regulation of administrative justice and, in 
general, was responsible for changing the practice of penal law and eliminating 
reactionary laws. The security committee was in charge of adapting the police 
apparatus to the new situation, as well as creating the basis for the total 
liquidation of the old army apparatus and the introduction of a peoples&#8217; 
militia, composed essentially of members of the three socialist organizations. 
The education committee&#8217;s mission was to transform the entire school system, 
from elementary to secondary levels, with the goal of establishing a unified 
school system. The committee on trade, shipping and industry was in charge of 
reincorporating Hamburg&#8217;s economic life into German production, and above all of 
refitting the metallurgical industry, especially the shipyards, for the repair 
and production of materiel for the railroads. The department of social policy 
had an almost decisive importance for the Council. It had to introduce the 
council system into the factories, so as to prepare for their socialization. In 
addition, this committee also functioned as a high court in case of conflicts 
between workers and owners. It did not replace the industrial tribunals, but in 
all important cases which would establish a precedent for the industry or 
economic life in general, after having heard the petitions of the two parties, 
it issued a binding decision; in this way all relations in the factories were 
definitively in the hands of this institution of the revolutionary Council. The 
results obtained by this committee fell short of what was desired, since in no 
field did it attain its initial objectives; the fault lay as much in its own 
deficiencies as in the resistance of the old authorities and the business class. 
This was also true of the committee on trade, shipping and industry and its 
attempt to reorganize the economy of the Hamburg area and to reintegrate it into 
German production. As difficult as this task was, it could have been carried out 
with even a minimum of collaboration on the part of the Prussian authorities.</p>

<p class="fst">Among the first measures of the Council, the implementation of 
the fundamental economic requirements of its labor policy stands out. At its 
second session it decreed the eight hour day, with the provision that, should 
the owners close their businesses in protest against this decree, the factories 
and workshops would be reopened by force. According to its manifesto, the whole 
sum of wages previously paid was to still be paid on a weekly basis, including 
payment for days not worked. From then on, the eight hour day or, where this was 
not practicable, as in the cases of food supply and transport, the working week 
of 48 hours, was set as the maximum. The wages to be paid were to be at least 
the same amount as had been paid for the previous regular day&#8217;s work. 
Consequently, hourly wages and piecework rates had to be raised until they 
reached the old daily wage, with the obligation to completely eliminate 
piecework as soon as possible. Overtime, where necessary, had to be paid with an 
extra premium, as stipulated for each case. These rules had to be rigorously 
obeyed and enacted without delay. Any infractions were to be severely punished, 
with the provision that the offending business could be expropriated by the 
Workers and Soldiers Council. The terms of this manifesto were not uniformly 
implemented, since the regulation of piecework was in the hands of the trade 
unions, and the resolution of complaints was under the control of the department 
of social policy, with the bulk of responsibility for such matters, which was at 
first the within the jurisdiction of that department, being later transferred to 
the trade unions. Nonetheless, the rules providing that the wages for the 
reduced work week had to be &#8220;at least&#8221; equal to the previous weekly wage, and 
that piecework had to be eliminated &#8220;completely and as quickly as possible&#8221; 
naturally stimulated more demands along the same lines. Nor was the situation to 
change much when, some time later, certain aspects of the manifesto were more 
clearly formulated, in order to regulate the situation in those enterprises 
where the reduction of the working week could not be immediately and completely 
enacted. The workers&#8217; attitude would continue to be largely determined by the 
initial proclamations.</p>

<p class="fst">Already, among its first acts, the Council addressed the problem 
of unemployment, since the number of unemployed soon surpassed 70,000, while 
those who could only find part-time work numbered over 100,000. The Senate and 
the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> had previously, prior to the revolution, decided to 
create a labor office, responsible for job placement, assisting demobilized 
soldiers, and organizing unemployment benefits; the latter consisted of 6 marks 
for a married couple without children, 1 ½ marks for each child up to a maximum 
of three, and 4 marks for single persons, which would cost the <i>Land</i> of 
Hamburg three million marks each month. Since this labor office had not yet been 
established, and the Council faced many problems on all fronts, the resolution 
of the matter had to be postponed until mid-December. This delay led to vast 
demonstrations of the unemployed, but the Council eventually managed to achieve 
a satisfactory settlement of the problem. It proposed to the unemployed that a 
permanent commission be established, elected by the unemployed with the widest 
possible representation of professions and industries, which would be in 
permanent contact with the Council, with representatives in the labor office and 
its various delegations, to maintain oversight of its operations. While military 
field kitchens supplied food at very low prices to the unemployed, and jobless 
people became involved in running these services, the Council ordered an 
increase in unemployment benefits: one mark extra for single persons and two 
more for couples. An attempt on the part of the Senate and the labor office to 
reduce these increases was vetoed by the Council. Only later was it decided that 
the total subsidy for each family could not surpass 7 ½ marks per week.</p>

<p class="fst">The Council&#8217;s activity, especially in the economic domain, 
encouraged the creation of new councils. The latter were formed among every 
category of civil servants, teachers, police, firemen, railroad workers, etc., 
as well as councils of white collar employees of every kind. The demand, often 
expressed by such councils, to be directly represented on the Workers and 
Soldiers Council, was not granted, since the number of members of the Executive 
Committee and the respective proportions of representatives of the parties and 
the factories had already been fixed, but direct and permanent liaisons were 
nonetheless established between the different councils and the corresponding 
committees of the Workers and Soldiers Council, in most cases with the 
department of social policy.</p>

<p class="fst">As soon as its working departments had been created, the Council 
began to organize the political control of the administrative apparatus. This 
control was exercised by means of the activity of those institutions (the 
committees) mentioned above, as well as by means of commissars who were 
dispatched to the most important departments. However, as was the case with the 
activity of the Council itself, there was a lack of trained personnel, as well 
as resistance from the higher functionaries, which had been a problem since the 
first day of the new regime and which had only grown stronger since then. 
Political control of the administrative apparatus could only be achieved by 
integrating it into the social democracy and thus reducing it, once it is free 
of any bureaucratic constraints and formalities, to its basic tasks, in other 
words, leaving it in the hands of the population itself and basing the municipal 
organization on the council system. But these difficulties did not prevent the 
Council from purging the administration of its most pernicious elements by means 
of a simple decree, as in the case of the high-level Prussian functionaries in 
the suburbs of Hamburg who were expelled from their posts, although against the 
protests of the governments of Schleswig and Berlin. The same thing happened to 
a district president, whose work was controlled and then partially taken over by 
a delegate of the Council. But problems arose even with the Council&#8217;s 
supporters. The workers and soldiers councils in the towns in the Hamburg region 
had eliminated their municipal councils and, in one town, had introduced the 
six-hour working day, and in another had revised the pay rates of all the 
government employees and white collar workers and deposed the landlords&#8217; 
representative. These events, which took place with the consent of the councils 
in these two towns, provided a reason to clearly delineate the responsibilities 
of the Workers Council, which was responsible not only for Hamburg, but also for 
Altona, Ottensen, Wandsbeck, and the whole area around the four cities in the 
neighboring territories.</p>

<p class="fst">According to the resulting decree, all the councils of the <i>
Land</i> of Hamburg were subordinated to the Hamburg Council as the bearer of 
political power in that state, and the local councils were to be only 
institutions for the control of their local administrations. They were forbidden 
to become involved in administrative activities at the level of the <i>Land</i>. 
In the region which was part of Prussia, the Council&#8217;s domain included the 
organizations and military units which sent representatives to the Council. In 
these cases, however, the Council could only operate as a control office for the 
local administrations, in accordance with the rules established by the Prussian 
government, and, in principle&#8212;the actual practice often varied&#8212;was not 
authorized to become involved in state administrative activities. The local 
councils in these outlying areas were recognized by the Hamburg Council; the 
latter provided them with protection and assistance and, in matters which 
affected all of them as a result of the economic interdependence of the region, 
they took joint action. Where no workers and soldiers council existed, the 
Hamburg Council was authorized to exercise the right to control the local 
administration through elected councilors.</p>

<p class="fst">Organizational measures and managerial tasks, of course, embraced 
the most diverse matters. The provisional Workers and Soldiers Council had 
formed a food supply committee, and its permission was required for the export 
of foodstuffs. Until then, such regulation had been in the hands of the War 
Supply Office and, in order to improve the system of food supply, it was 
demanded that this Office&#8217;s administrative district be extended from Hamburg to 
the surrounding urban and rural areas. The new Council also appointed a 
committee of five members to supervise the entire food supply system. This 
committee decided to assume the functions of the Office of War Supply and the 
Altona municipal council, in regard to their responsibilities for food supplies, 
a decision which, given the complexity of the apparatus of the Hamburg Office of 
War Supply, could not have been implemented without serious prejudice to the 
continuity of the food supply, and was also in contradiction of the ruling that 
the Hamburg state authorities were to remain in office for the time being. The 
Council therefore cancelled this decision. It later stipulated essential changes 
in food distribution, in the reduction of prices for rationed goods, and in 
those prices which could not be set without its consultation and consent. In the 
interest of the population, and to its benefit, the Council repeatedly 
intervened, both in regard to prices as well as the quantities of distributed 
goods.</p>

<p class="fst">The fact that the farmers did not deliver the prescribed 
quantities of food led to serious problems. Already in its first session the 
Council had discussed how to establish good communications between the city and 
the countryside, as well as a system of organized collaboration. It called for, 
among other things, the formation of peasants&#8217; councils, and carried out an 
extensive propaganda campaign on their behalf. These proposals, however, never 
came to a vote and were never implemented. Nor, after petitioning the imperial 
government and the Armistice Commission, were the Council&#8217;s efforts to reopen 
the offshore fisheries successful.</p>

<p class="fst">An economic council was formed under the auspices of the Council 
and representatives of industry, the banks and import-export firms, whose 
mission was to stimulate the resumption of trade, especially foreign trade. This 
collaborative effort did not, however, prove to be fruitful, since the 
divergence of opinions concerning the resumption of production and distribution 
was quite profound, and immediately became apparent. While its collaborators 
considered capitalist practices as natural, the Council was aiming for 
socialization. Consequently, only a few sessions of this economic council were 
held, with no practical results. The Workers and Soldiers Council naturally did 
not agree with the economic council&#8217;s demand that wages be reduced, although the 
trade union representatives readily showed some good will in that respect, which 
entailed no minor problems from the workers point of view. Since all socialist 
production is production in the interests of the consumer, the Council proposed 
that consumer prices be reduced, and that the first steps should be taken 
towards the reorganization of the distribution process. It proposed that the 
materiel stockpiled in the shipyards for the construction of submarines be used 
instead for the construction of rolling stock for the railroads. Recognizing 
that production is the basis of social life, it sought to fundamentally 
transform the role of the working class in production, putting the factories 
under its control, both socially and technically. The possibility of socializing 
the bakeries was debated. Since the twelve largest bakeries were capable of 
producing enough bread for the whole urban area, the elimination of the small 
and medium-size enterprises and their transformation into mere distribution 
centers would have implied important savings in industrial resources and raw 
materials, which would then have become available for other uses. The 
socialization of the fishing industry was also discussed with representatives of 
the fishermen, as its transfer to the control of the Hamburg<i> Land</i> was a 
relatively simple matter; such measures, so important for feeding the entire 
population, would have rendered socialization in other fields unavoidable. The 
Council also insisted that it not be excluded from the negotiations between the 
economic council and the imperial government concerning the supply of raw 
materials, guided by the idea that whoever directed the reorganization of 
economic life would also tighten their grip on political power. In the end, 
these projects soon became a dead letter because the Berlin government, 
handcuffed by its compromise and coalition with the big bourgeoisie, was neither 
willing nor able to undertake socialization. Disagreements within the Council 
itself were also becoming more acute, as well.</p>

<p class="fst">For these reasons, the Council sought to create fixed rules for 
the consolidation of the council system, while simultaneously maintaining the 
economic council in a certain relation of dependence. Towards this end it 
presented a series of regulations. These decreed that the economic council was 
an institution created as a consequence of the revolution, and that it had to 
present its proposals to the economic and industrial committee of the Workers 
and Soldiers Council, which would examine and approve them, prior to taking the 
necessary steps for their implementation. It mandated a workers council for each 
enterprise with more than twenty workers; enterprises with fewer than twenty 
workers were to join others of the same kind in order to elect factory councils; 
casual laborers were to unite according to their job categories in order to 
elect workers councils. All workers over the age of sixteen, according to this 
proposal, were granted the right to vote, and all those over the age of 20 would 
be eligible for office. The workers council was responsible for the orderly 
operation of the enterprise, as well as the control of its administration in its 
social, technical and commercial aspects, and the regulation, together with its 
owners, and in collaboration with the organizations of workers and white collar 
employees, of working conditions and wages. Where agreement on such issues could 
not be achieved, an appeal would have to be brought before the committee on 
social policy of the Workers and Soldiers Council, which would issue its ruling, 
with assistance from experts from both parties to the dispute. In general, the 
factory councils were to exercise the functions which had been delegated to them 
by the General Workers Council, without being prevented from doing so by either 
the factory owners or the old authorities. The General Workers Council set the 
rules for and established the framework of its field of action and the extent of 
its prerogatives, a resolution which would have enabled it, and, according to 
the intention of the authors of its proposals, had to enable it, to assume at 
any moment and to their full extent, all the political functions of the 
executive. The deliberations on this matter continued, and finally, when the 
Council&#8217;s power dissolved, and it no longer had the power to implement its 
proposals, they were liquidated on their own.</p>

<p class="fst">The workers in the urban area also naturally took advantage of 
the revolution to improve their standard of living, and to attempt to restore 
its pre-war level. Assisted in their efforts by the manifesto on the eight hour 
day and the rapid phase-out of piecework, the shipyard workers, for whom the 
latter stipulation was of the greatest concern, managed to practically eliminate 
piecework, despite the attempts of the owners to reintroduce it. In order to 
compel the payment of wages for the days when workers had attended the mass 
demonstrations, the Council closed one factory, arrested its owner, and 
confiscated his bank account. The Council repeatedly intervened on behalf of the 
seamen, in order to secure higher wages than had been granted to them by the 
sailors union and the ship-owners&#8217; association. In the plumbers strike the 
Council exerted pressure on the employers and imposed the recognition of the 
demands of the workers. In short, it supported wage demands with all of its 
political and moral prestige. In negotiations with the shipyard owners, the 
Council&#8217;s department of social policy reminded the owners that they had 
previously used political power to their own economic advantage, and tersely 
declared that the working class would henceforth do the same; it applied its own 
legal principles without any concern over the prospect that the big capitalists, 
who had never concerned themselves with the workers&#8217; sense of justice, might 
consider this to be an injustice. These acts profoundly changed the relation of 
forces between the workers and the owners. The department of social policy went 
far beyond the means which had until then been decisive in relations with the 
owners, whether it was the strike or negotiations between one organization and 
another, replacing them with completely new methods, trials before the Council, 
organ of political power of the whole working class, organized or not. Without 
being in a position to exercise a dictatorship in the strict sense of the word, 
wielding merely a subsidiary power in the apparatus of the bourgeois state, the 
Council largely eliminated, in the decisive political arenas, the old organs of 
negotiation and struggle, and transformed them into organs of the Council&#8217;s 
policy. In a later stage, during the city transport workers strike which lasted 
more than a week, it clearly proved to the whole world the importance of an 
energetic display of political power for the satisfaction of the demands of the 
working class; the Council was not, however, capable of rapidly ending this 
public calamity, nor could it meet all the workers&#8217; demands, or protect the 
public from a steep fare increase.</p>

<p class="fst">One of the Council&#8217;s most important tasks was the regulation of 
public security. It turned to the troops in the barracks and formed police 
patrols with some of them, while those not suited for such duties were 
transferred to honor guards, work details or other already-existing detachments. 
Besides their food and military pay they received a premium of three marks per 
day, as had those soldiers who were already assigned to police duties. Their 
maximum number was set at 2,400. At first the situation gave cause for concern: 
the police commissioners retained their seats on the <i>Bürgerschaft</i>, 
frustrated with waiting for their new orders and the satisfaction of their 
complaints. Order was reestablished by means of prompt dismissals. Enlistments 
for the <i>Freikorps</i> were also banned by the Council, which also ordered the 
dissolution of the youth militias.</p>

<p class="fst">In its socialization policy, the Council was aware of the need to 
restructure Hamburg&#8217;s position within the empire by considerably expanding its 
territory. Completely surrounded by Prussian territory, the city not only lacked 
the space to extend its industry and undertake a generous plan of construction, 
it did not even have enough territory to expand its port facilities, since the 
administrative rights to control the banks of the river were indispensable for 
this purpose and the city only had the responsibility to regulate the Elbe 
itself. The administrative division of the region between Hamburg, Altona and 
Wandsbeck resulted in short-sighted and parochial policies in all important 
projects, such as urban railways, construction, canals and lighting, and made 
the old system&#8217;s unprofitable nature evident, as well as the vast obstacles 
standing in the way of the extension of &#8220;municipal socialism&#8221;. The dominant 
opinion on the Council was, therefore, that Hamburg&#8217;s territory had to be 
enlarged. For the realization of this project, it was of the utmost importance 
that Germany should become a unified republic rather than continuing to be a 
federation of states. When Hamburg&#8217;s representatives at the Berlin conference of 
German states, which took place at the end of November, frankly expressed their 
&#8220;annexationist designs&#8221;, they triggered a great uproar, and the Prussian 
minister Hirsch was especially vehement in protesting this presumption of 
dismembering Prussian territories. The delegates nonetheless remained convinced 
that Hamburg would soon and without great difficulties, and with the assistance 
of the imperial institutions, achieve the indispensable expansion of its 
territory, a hope which would not be fulfilled.</p>

<p class="fst">At the beginning of December, the Hamburg Council convoked an 
assembly of delegates from all the region&#8217;s workers and soldiers councils in 
order to consider the proposal to create a unitary economic region on the lower 
Elbe, with its center in Hamburg, which would be called Greater Hamburg. The 
fears that Hamburg would endanger the unity of the empire were energetically 
denied; a forced annexation was out of the question. If, on occasion, in 
sessions of the Hamburg Council, the desire to extend the Council&#8217;s political 
power to Altona and Wandsbeck and to control these cities through commissars had 
been expressed, these opinions garnered no support. As for the borders of this 
future economic region, no proposals or decisions were made at this conference. 
It appeared, however, that a large majority of the delegates were in favor of 
incorporating a substantial strip of the Elbe valley, between Hamburg and the 
mouth of the river, into the territory of Hamburg. The conference declared its 
support for the creation of a Greater Hamburg administrative district, and 
delegated to the Hamburg Council the task of taking the necessary steps for its 
establishment, in cooperation with the local authorities and the neighboring 
workers and soldiers councils. In any event, the Hamburg Council did have the 
merit of taking the first steps to bring the matter to fruition and preparing 
negotiations with the imperial government. The subsequent eclipse of its power 
left the continuation of these negotiations in the hands of the Senate.</p>

<p class="fst">The Council was more successful in the field of education. It 
brought proposals before a series of professors, in order to settle the question 
of the university and to make the University of Hamburg a reality. But the 
project never advanced beyond the first stages of planning. The Council did, 
however, aggressively implement the law on secondary education, with essential 
improvements, which had been in abeyance for five years, and whose previous 
implementation had been postponed by the war and the lack of teachers. The 
education committee held discussions with the teachers council about 
reorganizing the entire Hamburg school system in order to create a unified 
school district. It eliminated religious instruction from all public schools and 
institutions and, as of January 1, 1919, nullified all the laws and decrees of 
the Senate concerning the parochial levy, which thus passed into the 
jurisdiction of the religious communities themselves. It also made it much 
easier to renounce religion, decreeing that it was sufficient for the individual 
to declare that he or she was fourteen years old and to make a written or oral 
declaration before the civil registry.</p>

<p class="fst">The Council also promptly addressed the issue of housing and 
construction. It recommended that the State buy all available building 
construction materials, and proposed special measures to prevent real estate 
speculation.</p>

<p class="fst">The Council&#8217;s sovereign exercise of its rights was indisputable. 
The Council, rather than the Senate, reduced a murderer&#8217;s sentence to life in 
prison. Upon their return from the front, it was the Council, as representative 
of the state, which welcomed the troops, while the Senate, as representative of 
the city, addressed them afterwards. It decreed that, at official events, the 
flags of Hamburg and the revolution should be displayed, rather than the old 
imperial banners. It repeatedly exercised its right to veto resolutions of the 
Senate and the <i>Bürgerschaft</i>. As the representative of the state it 
dispatched its representatives to the Conference of German States convened by 
the imperial government in late November. In the deliberations concerning this 
delegation&#8217;s mandate, the divisions within the Council could already be seen, 
which would later undermine its political power.</p>

<p class="fst">Since it was foreseen that the Conference of German States would 
also discuss the question of a constituent assembly, a debate took place in the 
Council concerning the position its representatives would defend in relation to 
this question. The right wing socialists rejected a council regime and demanded 
a prompt convocation of a constituent assembly. The USPD delegates supported 
this position in principle but wanted to delay the convocation of the 
constituent assembly for as long as possible, in order to allow the returning 
soldiers to participate, to prepare women for the electoral process, and to 
first secure the achievements of the revolution by initiating socialization. A 
USPD speaker said that the days of the soviet government were numbered, and that 
it would not be favorable for the compromise reached in the interest of the 
revolution by the three factions, if one of them were to declare itself against 
the constituent assembly. The representative of the communist wing of the 
movement, however, emphasized that political power had fallen into the hands of 
the working class, although the latter was not presently capable of exercising 
its dictatorship: this was prevented by the fact that the revolution had been 
for the most part the achievement of the army, and even then with the decisive 
support of bourgeois elements. If the revolution was to continue in a <i>smooth 
and orderly</i> manner, and, at the same time, the political power of the 
working class was to be secured, if a sharpening of class contradictions and 
even a civil war were to be prevented, then only one road remained. There was 
danger from both the right and the left. From the left, because, as attempts 
were being made to prevent the installation of a soviet system and to reinstate 
the capitalist order, the influence of syndicalist and anarchist elements would 
grow, and with it the danger of armed insurrections. From the right, because the 
restoration of capitalism would be accompanied by the rearming of the 
bourgeoisie. To prevent these two possibilities, and the consequent civil war, 
from taking place, the total political power of the working class must be 
maintained in order to assure socialization; the bourgeoisie, however, had to be 
offered the chance to influence the course, the form and the manner of 
socialization, in accordance with its numerical importance in society. The 
convocation of a constituent assembly meant the demise of the workers&#8217; power: 
the political power of the bourgeoisie would not be questioned, if the workers 
did not enter the electoral struggle as a united class. Whoever wanted to 
preserve the political power of the working class could not therefore support 
the convocation of a constituent assembly, which the bourgeoisie was loudly 
demanding. However, alongside the organ of the rule of the working class, the 
Central Council, a parliament could be created, elected by a general vote, 
which, under the control of the workers government, and with clearly-defined 
responsibilities, would provide a certain margin of maneuver for the 
bourgeoisie, so they could defend their interests during the course of 
socialization. This argument, which was also schematically outlined during the 
Conference of German States, since it was not possible to present it in all of 
its details, had practically no support on the Council. On the contrary, the 
positions of the various party factions were directly opposed to one another on 
a question which was not merely a simple matter of the division between the 
working class and the bourgeoisie, but revolved around the question of power as 
it affected the working class itself: the power structures of the old 
organizations transformed the struggle for the leadership of the class into a 
struggle over the position and identity of the personnel of its leadership.</p>

<p class="fst">The course of events in the Empire thus had to have negative 
consequences for the political position of the Hamburg Council. On the question 
of the legal foundations of the State, upon which the reorganization of the 
Empire had to be based, there were serious differences of opinion between the 
two leftist factions. Each had essentially distinct assessments of the national 
assembly. The attempt of the communist council delegates to get the Council, and 
particularly its left wing, to accept a common line did not prosper. For this 
reason, on the important question of Hamburg&#8217;s external policies, many said: 
concerning the domestic policy of the Empire, the influence which the left 
factions exercised over the Soldiers Council in other matters failed from the 
first moment, and the bourgeois component of the Soldiers Council was able to 
prevail, which led to a situation where the Hamburg Council&#8217;s external policies 
were harmed by what appeared to be its strong points in Hamburg itself. On the 
other hand, the exclusive political rule of the working class was more 
accentuated in Hamburg than anywhere else, and much more so than in the imperial 
government, which from the very beginning had insisted upon a coalition with the 
bourgeoisie. If the Empire would not follow Hamburg, if the revolution were to 
recede rather than advance, the foundations of the Hamburg Council&#8217;s policies 
would dissolve. And this is precisely what happened. In a short time, and 
especially after the First Congress of the Councils, a fierce struggle erupted 
among the Council&#8217;s factions for its leadership and power base. As in the 
empire, so too in Hamburg, the leaders of the socialist right wing led a turn 
towards the past.</p>

<p class="fst">While it was the Council&#8217;s policy to try to exercise an 
increasingly more strict control over the bourgeois administration, organically 
integrating itself into its highest offices, the old party, in contradiction to 
this policy, appointed four senators in Altona. In the trade unions, a vigorous 
attack was launched regarding the composition of the Council; its dissolution 
and immediate elections were energetically demanded, which would have endangered 
everything which had been achieved, with the obvious intention of negating the 
Council&#8217;s policy and carrying out a total about-face, an attack which curiously 
took place at the same time as the first session of the <i>Bürgerschaft</i>. 
Already, at this first session, the president was going to present a motion, 
supported by all the factions, to grant Hamburg an electoral law, as the Hamburg 
Council had decreed, but assigning the drafting of this electoral law to the 
Senate and the <i>Bürgerschaft</i>. This maneuver was an attempt to restore 
their former legislative powers to these institutions, and thus their former 
political powers as well. The Senate&#8217;s representative admitted during the 
deliberations on this matter that it was basically an attempt to force a 
confrontation on the question of power, and that he considered this initiative 
to be premature. But the old party continued to pursue the matter, only 
introducing a small amendment to the motion which would eliminate the <i>
Bürgerschaft</i> as a political factor, yet fully reinstating the Senate in its 
old status. The struggle quickly ended in an unequivocal defeat of the <i>
Bürgerschaft</i>, and the Council&#8217;s sovereignty was clearly emphasized when, at 
the first session, the Council president laconically declared in the name of the 
Council that as a consequence of the revolution political power had passed into 
the hands of the Workers and Soldiers Council and that the Senate and the <i>
Bürgerschaft</i> had been eliminated as political entities, which would only 
continue to exist as communal and administrative institutions, and that the 
Council had also, of course, made it known that the jurisdictional arrangements 
thus established would be acknowledged by the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> just as the 
Senate had previously done.</p>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile, fundamental transformations had also taken place in 
the Soldiers Council. In order to establish parity with the Workers Council it 
had, without consulting anyone, increased its membership from 15 to 30, and the 
representatives of the old party and the trade unions were well-prepared to 
easily take advantage of this change and the consequent increase of the 
bourgeois element, in order to set down roots in the Soldiers Council and to 
convert it into their own secure fortress. How much the situation had changed 
could clearly be seen when the Soldiers Council addressed the issue of the 
popular militia. The committee responsible for implementing this measure set 
forth rules which dictated that the militia would be composed of dedicated 
militants from the three socialist groups: regardless of individual political 
convictions, it must not be the instrument of any one socialist faction or its 
policies. As an organization independent of the security service, which it had 
to assist in certain circumstances, its members would keep weapons in their 
homes, and would in principle be economically dependent upon only their day 
jobs. The militia depended upon the central government, although the day-to-day 
command functions necessary to fulfill the militia&#8217;s specific task remained in 
the hands of the territorial government: this task was to safeguard the 
revolution. The motion was defeated due to the resistance of the representatives 
of the old party and the leaders of the Soldiers Council, and these two groups 
managed to table the discussion and leave its future in the hands of the 
Soldiers Council. This signified the elimination of the popular militia as far 
as Hamburg was concerned, which was clearly stated in a protest of the communist 
wing of the Council and the representatives of the Independent Social Democratic 
Party.</p>

<p class="fst">This was the situation when the First Congress of Workers and 
Soldiers Councils convened in Berlin. The attempt to keep the Hamburg delegation 
united as the sole representative body of the Council failed; some of the 
representatives of the Soldiers Council along with the representatives of the 
old party separated from the rest of the delegates. Since there was no communist 
fraction at the Congress, and the Council&#8217;s radical wing did not want to join 
either of the other two socialist groups, and faced with the obligation of 
belonging to a fraction, which was a condition indirectly imposed by the rules 
of the Congress, it formed an independent fraction of United Revolutionary 
Workers and Soldiers, which had the promising number of 24 members. The motion 
presented to the Congress by the communist wing, which was consonant with the 
policy of the Hamburg Council, stated: &#8220;The revolutionary proletariat, together 
with the revolutionary army, have overthrown the old powers. With the victorious 
conclusion of the uprising, supreme power has fallen into the hands of the 
workers and soldiers councils. As representative of the workers and soldiers 
councils throughout all of Germany, the Congress takes possession of political 
power and the responsibility for exercising that power. As bearer of the 
sovereignty of the empire it has the right to control, to nominate or to depose 
any member of the executive. The Congress demands the immediate departure from 
the government of its bourgeois members. It shall elect a commission which will 
present proposals concerning the situation of the former members of the 
government.&#8221; As a result of this motion&#8217;s status under the Congress&#8217;s rules of 
order, it was debated only on the last day of the Congress, by which time the 
Congress had already voted in favor of the well-known and quite different motion 
presented by Lüdemann, thus rendering the revolutionaries&#8217; motion null and void.</p>

<p class="fst">Faced with the divergent tendencies which wracked the Council, 
the Council&#8217;s leadership called for the unity of the whole working class, in 
order to secure and to extend the revolution and its conquests. This goal was 
not hindered by an attempted coup against the Council which involved various 
former members of the Council and its press office, together with bourgeois 
editors, financial circles and politicians. Several editors of the <i>Echo</i> 
were also in on the plot, as they had to confess in writing while under 
interrogation. The plotters wanted to arrest fourteen members of the Council to 
hold as hostages, in order to execute them in case of a revolutionary 
counter-action, as they said in a leaflet. On the basis of a proposal which had 
previously been prepared by the Council, in assemblies convoked for this 
purpose, it was ruled and decided that, in order to prevent the recovery of the 
forces of reaction, the security forces must be composed exclusively of 
dedicated revolutionaries, and that all the stores of arms and ammunition should 
be under the exclusive control of faithful troops, and also that the Committee 
of Seven of the Supreme Soldiers Council, which was in command of the troops, 
should be composed solely of determined revolutionaries. Officers&#8217; military 
insignia and uniforms were also prohibited, all officers were required to 
disarm, and the soldiers councils were made responsible for the loyalty of the 
various military units. Officers were allowed to be members of the councils if 
they were elected by a majority of their detachments and were known to be 
convinced supporters of the revolution, demands which, in a more detailed and 
somewhat modified form, were approved by the First Council Congress, where they 
became famous under the name of the Hamburg Seven Points. In order to help bring 
about the political unity of the workers and to provide more publicity for the 
Council&#8217;s policies, it was demanded, recalling the revolution&#8217;s first measures, 
that the <i>Hamburger Echo</i> should be placed at the disposal of the Council. 
When the Hamburg troops extended the ruling against officers&#8217; insignia to all 
military insignia, opposition arose, particularly from the lower 
non-commissioned ranks.</p>

<p class="fst">The watchword of unity heightened the workers&#8217; consciousness of 
belonging to one class, and its most profound significance was that under no 
circumstances whatsoever, and under no political pretext, should the members of 
the working class ever take up arms against one another. It also helped members 
of the old party and independent social democrats to move towards the left, and, 
furthermore, if this watchword of unity did not prevail, the structure of the 
Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) would have been compromised, since 
this party contained two distinct factions. In general, however, the 
negotiations concerning a unitary organization, then taking place in Hamburg, 
could only construct the basic framework for the future, while the general 
direction of events could clearly be seen in the fact that the basis which had 
been established for a fusion of the organizations was undoubtedly favorable for 
the communists: the revolution had created new conditions which made the 
unification of the revolutionary working masses possible. In the future, the 
politics, tactics and organization of the working class had to be oriented 
within the framework of the revolution. The Würzburg program had lost all 
meaning after the revolution. The Erfurt program must henceforth be the point of 
departure, with its principles of socialization of the means of production and 
the class struggle, taking into account, of course, that in regard to many other 
issues this program was not in the forefront of the movement. Since the old 
organizational apparatus corresponded to neither the level of social 
development, nor to the political and tactical needs of the working class, a new 
program and a new organization became necessary, which would be more suited to 
the conditions of the revolution, and which could guarantee that in the future 
the will of the organized militants would not only be expressed by the 
leadership, but would really determine the movement&#8217;s policies and tactics.</p>

<p class="fst">But it was precisely the considerable success of this call for 
unity which exacerbated the differences of opinion among the Council&#8217;s leaders 
and, after the First Congress of Councils, the attacks commenced against the 
power of command exercised by the soldiers councils, the representatives of the 
Berlin government and the trade unions no longer concealed their aversion for 
the workers councils, and doubts arose concerning their sincerity in proposing 
to undertake socialization. When the situation in Berlin subsequently rapidly 
deteriorated, revolutionary delegates from the factories of Hamburg issued a 
call for a solidarity strike, which led to a demonstration against the leaders 
of the socialist right and the trade unions. These delegates demanded 
socialization, especially of the large factories, the guarantee of an eight hour 
working day, and decent wages, as well as the total elimination of piecework and 
price gouging. A delegation sent to the Council brought news that strikers had 
occupied the trade union offices in order to shut them down. It demanded that 
the Council ratify and implement these measures. In order to guarantee the 
safety of buildings and property, the president of the Council declared, in the 
presence of a small proportion of the Council&#8217;s membership&#8212;as many as were 
necessary for a quorum since, faced with the urgency of the situation, not all 
of them could be gathered together in such a short time&#8212;that the strikers&#8217; 
delegation&#8217;s desires were to be provisionally satisfied, and ordered that the 
necessary measures be taken. The trade union offices were therefore closed, and 
the Council guaranteed their security. But this measure led to the most violent 
confrontations within the Council. The right wing passionately rejected it, and 
the Soldiers Council&#8217;s Committee of Seven decided to evacuate the trade union 
offices with three companies of infantry, but, after considering the possible 
grave consequences of such an employment of armed force, did not dare to carry 
out its own decree.</p>

<p class="fst">Despite the tumultuous proceedings, the debate in the Council 
crystallized around the question of the relations between the council system and 
the trade unions. The right wing socialists, who insisted upon the preservation 
of the old organizational jurisdictions and relations, were told that the 
revolution was not over, and that its basic effectiveness resided in the 
consolidation of the council system. Since it was primarily an organization of 
the factories, which places the latter under the control of the workers, the 
council system was also a new way to conceive of the construction of the economy 
and society, and was at the same time the culmination of the organization of the 
working class, embracing both its political and its economic aspects; it 
expressed the unity of the class and was, furthermore, incompatible with 
separate political and economic organizations, which the working class had 
created within the framework of capitalist society for its fight against that 
society. In principle and in practice, the council system therefore superseded 
the political and trade union apparatuses of the pre-revolutionary era. The 
demonstration which was taking place at that time, whose purpose was to bring 
awareness of the council system&#8217;s new tasks to the masses, was, despite the 
circumstances which accompanied it, the beginning of a new era in the struggle 
in Hamburg as well. The Council finally passed a resolution which, in 
consideration of the ambivalence of the government&#8217;s policies, demanded the 
resignation of the Ebert-Scheidemann-Noske government, called for the 
consolidation of the council system in the factories, and defined the Council as 
the decision-making power in all industrial affairs. In order to make this last 
point of the resolution an effective reality, a revolutionary tribunal had to be 
created. The Council, the resolution also proclaimed, was the supreme and 
highest power of the Hamburg workers, to which the trade union organizations had 
to be subordinated. The detailed exposition of these principles was to be 
elaborated by a committee whose composition would be determined at a later time.</p>

<p class="fst">Since on that same evening excesses had been committed at the <i>
Hamburger Echo</i>, with much destruction on the ground floor, the Council 
president, taking action to pacify the crowd, decreed that the building should 
be closed, provisionally prohibiting the publication of the newspaper to prevent 
new incidents, and above all because numerous provocateurs had infiltrated the 
crowd. This measure was also applied, for reasons of fairness, to the second 
socialist newspaper published in the city, that of the independent social 
democrats, and this edict was later ratified by the Council. A committee was 
formed to deliberate upon the question of what concrete conditions would have to 
be met for the <i>Echo</i> to be reopened. It ruled that the measure which had 
been proposed after the coup attempt, and which had been approved by acclamation 
in popular assemblies, must be implemented immediately, and that the newspaper, 
by means of an equal allotment of editorial positions, must be transformed into 
an organ of the Council. The committee understood, of course, that it would 
naturally have to simultaneously suspend the publication of the newspaper of the 
Independent Social Democratic Party, thus assuring unity on the terrain of the 
press, and in the future, the unity of the political organization as well. 
However, before the Council could implement these measures, it was prevented 
from doing so by the arrest of the Council&#8217;s president, who was seized in the 
meeting hall, with threats and by force, by security troops; at the same time, 
the Soldiers Council occupied the <i>Echo</i> with a strong contingent of 
soldiers, to protect it against the Council&#8217;s ruling.</p>

<p class="fst">As a result of these events, the old party organized a large 
demonstration which took place on January 11, 1919. The implementation of a 
Council edict had been prevented by the intervention of armed force in the 
interest of one party. But the president had to be released a few hours later, 
by order of the Council. Only one road remained if the dictatorship of the 
Soldiers Council over the Workers Council was not to be openly proclaimed, 
thereby setting a precedent for the future: the Workers Council had to be 
deposed, and its membership re-elected upon a foundation which would guarantee a 
better composition, as understood by the right wing socialists. Consequently, 
they wanted to compel the Workers Council to resign. As representatives of a 
crowd which filled the entire plaza assembled before the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> 
building&#8212;large businesses had closed and sometimes even compelled their 
employees to participate in the demonstration&#8212;a delegation appeared in the 
Council&#8217;s meeting chamber, and posed the question of whether the Workers Council 
was ready to resign. The delegation was informed that, in principle, the Council 
was ready to resign at any moment, but that its resignation was itself 
exclusively the decision of the General Workers Council, and that it would not 
take place without the latter&#8217;s intervention; there remained the possibility of 
resorting, with the assent of the Soldiers Council, to the use of force against 
the whole Workers Council, as had occurred a few days earlier in the case of the 
Council&#8217;s president. Even when the dismissal of the Workers Council was proposed 
to the crowd waiting outside, and the crowd supported the proposal, the radical 
majority of the Workers Council was no more compliant. After another round of 
heated debate, the delegation contented itself with a declaration in which it 
recognized the need for the council system and its consolidation&#8212;its attack had 
been basically directed against this position&#8212;while the Council agreed to bring 
a proposal before the General Workers Council concerning the re-election of the 
executive committee on the basis of a system of proportional representation by 
party instead of the system of representation by factory regardless of party 
affiliation. As had been foreseen, the General Workers Council refused to 
consider the proposal. The proportional system was eventually imposed in Hamburg 
by the German Central Council immediately prior to the elections for the Second 
Council Congress, by which time the political power of the working class had 
long since expired.</p>

<p class="fst">A phase of dictatorship by the Soldiers Council began. Not only 
did it spread the idea among the security troops and soldiers that the left wing 
and the Workers Councils were planning a putsch, but a long and bizarre series 
of arrests of alleged Spartacists took place, among people who, while not always 
totally inoffensive, had nothing at all to do with the Spartacus League. The 
Committee of Seven even ordered the arrest of the leader of the delegation of 
the shipyard workers which had demanded the closure of the trade union offices, 
charging him with the completely baseless accusation that he, a Russian, had 
called for armed resistance and the occupation of the trade union offices, and 
that his identification papers were forged. Upon the request of the Foreign 
Minister, and against the will of the judge presiding over the case in Hamburg, 
who had expressly refused to authorize his arrest, the accountant of the Russian 
Consulate was arrested and brought to Berlin. Various people working in the 
municipal administration were arrested, accused of having provided the spokesmen 
of the delegation from the shipyard with his supposedly false identification 
papers, in the form of a travel pass with a false name. Since they did not want 
to assume any more responsibility for this arbitrary regime, which had not 
consulted the Council&#8217;s justice committee about any of these matters, the 
justice committee&#8217;s president, along with the president of the Council, 
resigned, and issued a public declaration. Afterwards, events took their 
inevitable course, which can be summarized as follows: the opposition in the 
Council, when the elections for Council president were held, submitted blank 
ballots. A representative of the right wing socialists was elected. The growing 
strength of reaction in Germany, assisted by the newly-formed white guards, and 
the government policy of progressively eliminating the power of the councils and 
revoking their rulings and decrees, rendered the continuation of the Council&#8217;s 
policies, as they had been originally conceived, impossible.</p>

<p class="fst">The new leadership began to systematically curtail the Council&#8217;s 
political power. It proposed immediate elections for the <i>Bürgerschaft</i>. 
The communist group, of course, had not only never opposed the election of a 
communal representative body, but had recommended it from the early days of the 
Council. But the old party had a much more ambitious goal, that is, to reinstate 
the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> in its old position and with its old rights. The 
Council, which due to personnel changes in the Soldiers Council, was 
increasingly dominated by right wing socialists, decided, after extensive 
negotiations, that it would elect a new municipal parliament, which would have 
the old name of the <i>Bürgerschaft</i>, and that all those who had voted for 
the national assembly would have the right to vote in this election, if the date 
set for the elections in Hamburg came within six months. Another ruling followed 
this one which went much further, according to which the <i>Bürgerschaft</i> 
would be a legislative body, with political power. According to the decisive 
first article of the ruling decreed by the Council on the elections for the <i>
Bürgerschaft</i>, its tasks, besides the management of day-to-day affairs, 
consisted in debating and approving a new constitution, and formulating and 
passing the laws required to complement the new constitution. A motion to the 
effect that the ruling must be in accord with the manifesto of November 12, 
1918, in other words, that the Council had veto power over any decisions 
concerning the constitution, which was a prerequisite of political power prior 
to the accession to power of the Council, was rejected. An attempt to at least 
assure a reorganization of the Senate, adapting it to the new times, also 
failed, and its opponents explained that it was not the Council&#8217;s job to decree 
such decisive rulings and that the new <i>Bürgerschaft</i> should regulate such 
matters. These decisions basically corresponded to the stance of the imperial 
government, which no longer recognized the Council as the bearer of political 
power in Hamburg. When a delegation from Hamburg had to be selected for the new 
Chamber of States, the national government turned to the Senate, despite the 
Council&#8217;s protests, in this case curiously joined by the representatives of the 
old party, which were of no avail; this is how the government&#8217;s policy, which, 
under pressure from a succession of revolutionary strikes, was forced to allow 
the continued existence of workers councils in the factories, managed to 
eliminate the councils wherever they had political power, as it had already 
eliminated the soldiers councils&#8217; power of command.</p>

<p class="fst">The factional disputes in Hamburg also facilitated the advance of 
the reactionary forces. The new leadership allowed the enlistment of volunteer 
units without any restrictions. Council decisions encountered the open 
resistance of the authorities&#8212;not least of all from the police and the various 
branches of the soldiers councils&#8212;or were sometimes contested by the sudden 
rebellion of the employers. This situation had the greatest impact on the 
rulings of the department of social policy. In part, the employers no longer 
paid it any heed, and in other cases its legal jurisdiction was denied, with the 
support of decrees by the imperial government, since it was once again possible, 
by citing these decrees, to carry out the most reactionary judicial initiatives, 
even against the trade unions. The textile workers union, for example, had 
decided to shut down a firm, and the department of social policy had ruled in 
the union&#8217;s favor. The firm presented a demand to withdraw this ruling, and also 
demanded a declaration that the reasons for the closing of its plant proffered 
by the union were not true: a counterrevolutionary act which was no longer 
content with attacking the Council, but openly took on the trade unions. 
Considering the great importance of the case, the Council pondered the option of 
intervening outside of its jurisdiction and prohibiting the court from ruling on 
the appeal. A motion to do so was approved, and it was also decided that a 
delegation should be sent to Berlin. The Council&#8217;s initiative came to nothing, 
because the end of the Council was immanent.</p>

<p class="fst">Particularly during the Council&#8217;s last days one could note that 
various attempts to create a special tribunal with jurisdiction over all 
questions involving the revolution and the power of the Council, which could not 
be judged by reference to the existing laws, had not borne fruit, thus rendering 
the Council&#8217;s rulings unenforceable. Whenever business owners appealed the 
rulings of the department of social policy before the courts, the latter ruled 
that the department&#8217;s decrees were not legal. And everything remained as before. 
Although a proposal to create a special tribunal was submitted to the justice 
committee for debate and elaboration, no definitive decision was reached, and 
when a tribunal was nevertheless created, its president, a high court judge, 
resigned because the tribunal was not compatible with judicial procedure.</p>

<p class="fst">When Liebknecht was buried in Berlin, the Council only sent a 
delegation. A public declaration was no longer possible. Meanwhile, the 
well-known battle of Bremen was taking place. The imperial government took 
advantage of the collapse of Bremen&#8217;s government to subject this port city to 
its power, and to impose a government of right wing socialists more to its 
taste. It thus intervened in the military region of the Ninth Army Corps, 
without prior notice, which gave rise to serious discontent: the Soldiers 
Council of the Ninth Army Corps responded by mobilizing its forces, that is, 
with a declaration of war. This was a very precipitous step, taken without 
consulting the Workers Council, one which would have the most disastrous 
consequences if it did not have any real power behind it, and even more so, if 
it did not have any capability for carrying out military actions; this turned 
out to be the case, since the Hamburg Soldiers Council refused to obey the 
orders of the Ninth Army Corps Soldiers Council High Command, at first 
clandestinely and then openly. The disaster which was immanent in these 
circumstances could only be prevented by the unanimous intervention of the 
workers of the four cities, assuring that the necessary measures should be 
taken. The Hamburg General Workers Council therefore passed a resolution 
demanding that the workers be armed within 48 hours. Compliance with this order 
could be expected of the military command, despite such short notice, since it 
had been delegated the responsibility for studying the question of forming 
militias many weeks before. The Workers Council also demanded that access roads 
be secured, that food supplies in the port be requisitioned, and that Bremen be 
supported with all military means possible. The attack on Bremen was not just 
the logical continuation of the Berlin military high command&#8217;s attempt to repeal 
the fundamental achievement of the revolution, the exercise of the power of 
military command by the soldiers councils, and the elimination of the Hamburg 
Seven Points, which had already suffered a serious defeat in the struggles in 
Berlin, and which, with the defeat of Bremen, would be definitively annihilated: 
the total elimination of the revolutionary remnants of the old army was also 
immanent, as well as the fall of the new military apparatus which was in the 
process of formation into the hands of the old general staff.</p>

<p class="fst">The outcome of the political and military success of this action 
would be of more benefit to the military than to the imperial government. The 
same was true, or even more so, of its possible further consequences. The 
government would never feel safe as long as it was not master of its coasts. But 
if it were to establish itself here, the military gang will have gained a base 
where, one day&#8212;perhaps while fighting against the imperial government itself&#8212;it 
might join forces with the English troops of the Entente. The intention of the 
Council&#8217;s left wing was to keep the government and its military away from the 
coast, and it was possible to achieve this goal. Given the forces of the 
formations of armed workers in Bremen, which were well-entrenched, several 
thousand men were enough to momentarily prevent the Gerstenberg division from 
entering Bremen. There were more than enough arms and munitions in Hamburg. The 
breathing space so gained could have been used to fully arm all the workers of 
the coastal regions of the North Sea. A battle for the port of Hamburg, with its 
stockpiles of food and materiel, would never be tolerated by the government. And 
at least during these moments of shared danger, the call to unity had an effect. 
Not even the right wing socialist leadership could yield under these 
circumstances; it was obliged to participate in public demonstrations against 
Noske, and had resigned itself to the possibility of armed defense. The 
communist wing, meanwhile, considered linking up with the industrialized regions 
of the Elbe to join with the revolutionary workers of Saxony and central Germany 
in one uninterrupted chain. It wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to 
intervene in the course of events in the rest of Germany, and to give a decisive 
boost to the revolution. Were this plan to succeed, the government and the 
national assembly would be lost, since a few weeks later the strikes broke out 
in central Germany.</p>

<p class="fst">This policy ultimately failed as a result of the serious 
disagreements among the Council&#8217;s factions, even though unity among the workers 
themselves took a great step forward, and the general swing towards the left 
obliged the right wing socialist leaders to clearly distance themselves from the 
government&#8217;s militarist policy. The disagreements among the factions led to the 
resistance of the Hamburg Soldiers Council and its leadership to the orders of 
the Ninth Army Corps High Command. A vivid display of personal grudges! Amidst 
these events the Hamburg Seven Points met their definitive demise, buried by 
precisely those who had previously used them as a springboard for their first 
promotions, and who had shortly thereafter distinguished themselves, following 
the general trend, as government favorites.</p>

<p class="fst">These events decided the Council&#8217;s fate. Its activity from this 
point on would be nothing but agonizing and disgraceful death throes, from which 
the communist representatives kept their distance. The immediate consequence of 
this death spasm, for the workers, was the total paralysis of the department of 
social policy. Even in the Council, its activity was violently criticized 
because&#8212;although this had been true since its inception&#8212;its rulings clashed with 
the judicial norms of imperial law; since the revolution had only replaced the 
prior sovereignty with the Council, it was said, the Council&#8217;s jurisdiction must 
be limited by the laws of the Empire; this constituted an attempt to base the 
revolution upon bourgeois law, which was possible because all the courts had 
recognized the imperial government. It finally occurred to the department&#8217;s 
supporters to subject all the department&#8217;s rulings to the Council&#8217;s enabling 
clause. But the justice department, which had been assigned the task of 
examining the case, proposed submitting an appeal to the courts to test the 
validity of the department&#8217;s rulings. An old experience was once again verified: 
when you have political power, legal formulations are an easy matter. When power 
is lost, legal formulations cannot overcome and eliminate the resistance of 
reality.</p>

<p class="fst">Up to this time an arbitration committee had yet to be created. 
The demobilization commissioner declared that until such a committee was 
nominated, he would name one in its place. There were thus two departments of 
social policy, with overlapping functions, one based on a decree of the imperial 
government, the other on the shattered political power of the Council. The end 
had come for the department of social policy, and the decision to bring the 
matter before the General Workers Council amounted to no more than a ploy to 
gain time, faced with the necessity of recognizing the full significance of the 
situation, which would have been more dignified.</p>

<p class="fst">Since the Council had withdrawn from the political arena, there 
were some debates on this problem, but no definitive position was adopted. When 
the new <i>Bürgerschaft</i> met for the first time, with a majority of right 
wing socialists, the Council president, also a right wing socialist, surrendered 
the Council&#8217;s political power to the new parliamentary body. In accordance with 
the policy of the imperial government, the new Workers Council, which was 
meeting at the same time, would no longer exercise political functions, but only 
economic ones.</p>

<p class="fst">An apolitical council system&#8212;an impossible demand, a political 
fantasy! The government, with the help of loyal military units, defeated the 
revolutionary remnants of the old army. But it has not yet been able to stop the 
workers&#8217; revolutionary strikes, nor will it be able to do so, so it seems. 
Chained to the bourgeoisie, and to the compromise it concluded with the 
bourgeoisie, which entailed both the rejection of any socialization as well as 
the elimination of the councils, it will have to reject any concession which 
could endanger this coalition, and with it the continued existence of the 
government itself. Even more important is the fact that it has retreated on both 
these points before the pressure of the strikes. It promised that the councils 
would be institutionalized in the constitution, that socialization would be 
carried out, and that the legal foundations for socialization would be created. 
However, the different parties to the labor process recognized by the government 
contradict the fundamental idea of the council system. The so-called 
Socialization Law is a stillborn law, which does not go beyond the juridical 
principles of the legal state, and the taxation of the coal trade is the 
opposite of a socialization measure. While these concessions and the way they 
were made could only strengthen the contradictory intermediate position of the 
government, without satisfying the working class in any way, the pacification 
ploy of making the councils participate in socialization contains an even 
greater contradiction.</p>

<p class="fst">Only those who hold political power can carry out socialization. 
Socialization is only possible by confronting and fundamentally transforming the 
old bureaucracy, by radically confronting capitalism, as an economic principle 
and as a social class, by totally replacing the existing social powers, by 
completely reorganizing the laws of property, production and distribution. And 
in this vast process of the transformation of all of society, the councils are 
the revolutionary and transformative instruments of the working class. Who would 
believe that, having found a solution for these problems, relegating the 
councils to the economic sphere is the most urgent political task of the present 
and the greatest social problem of our culture in the future?</p>

<p class="fst">The councils in large industrial factories embrace, as a matter 
of principle, control over the enterprises in the technical and commercial 
aspects as well. In the smaller and more decentralized industries, their tasks 
are even more daunting. Here they will lay the foundations for concentrating 
production into larger units. Savings, in the widest social meaning, are now a 
vital necessity for all of society. A private capitalist economy saves in each 
particular capitalist enterprise, while a socialized economy saves on the level 
of the economy as a whole. Even if it closes small and medium-sized enterprises 
and therefore destroys private capital, an economy undergoing socialization will 
intervene in this manner if required by the general interest, or if this can be 
done without serious consequences. In this transformation towards higher forms 
of production, in the employment of labor power and physical plant which will 
have thus been freed, the factory councils will be as indispensable as the 
councils of the towns, the cities and industries, since such a reorientation of 
industry would be impossible without a corresponding reorganization of its 
administration.</p>

<p class="fst">As a new social principle of organization and administration, the 
council system opposes to municipal politics, which is the basis of the private 
economy, and therefore of capitalist society, the idea of the union of all those 
who work in production on the basis of the nature and location of their 
production. Just as the era of tribal organization had its own forms of group 
socialization, and the era of the private organization of the economy manifests 
forms of interconnection between essentially different groups, so too does 
socialized society create its own particular new forms of union and integration. 
The blood ties of tribal organization as a constructive principle of human 
economy and society were succeeded by the no less simple idea of one&#8217;s 
residence, of municipal politics within a country or a territory. This 
principle, which has dominated civilization for thousands of years, is now 
replaced by the principle of labor. To the idea of municipal politics, and its 
highest manifestation in democracy and parliament, is contrasted, without being 
totally disconnected from those two concepts, the organizational and 
administrative idea of the councils, which is radically opposed to the former 
notion. This does not imply that a social organization which has taken thousands 
of years to develop and has attained its latest bourgeois-capitalist form during 
the last several centuries can be rapidly and totally established upon entirely 
new bases. The two social principles, perhaps for a very long time, will be 
obliged to accept practical compromises and to coexist. What must be decided 
upon now is not the absolute elimination and destruction of the old principle, 
but the question of which of the two principles should dominate society, which 
one of them must prevail over the other. Until now, the ties of nationality have 
been based upon coercion from above. The new system will organize the nations 
from below. And it is precisely due to this fact that the new system will obtain 
the security which will allow it to prevail over the old, which no foreign 
forces will be able to prevent or oppress, and which will bring in its wake, in 
all regions and throughout the world, with the guarantee of domestic 
invincibility, the possibility of the unlimited expansion of the world socialist 
order.</p>
