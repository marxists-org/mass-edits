<p class="fst">Tony Cliff based his theory that the USSR and countries with
analogous socio-economic structures are &#8216;state-capitalist&#8217; on a
set of hypotheses which are taken as axiomatic. We shall outline six
of them:</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>Soviet society and the societies of Western Europe, of the
United States and of Japan are all qualitatively the same since they
are all capitalist.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>In the USSR a new ruling class exists which is not based on
private property but which can nevertheless be characterised as
capitalist.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The Soviet economy is fundamentally ruled by the law of
value, &#8216;operating via the world market&#8217;, even though internal
competition has been eliminated.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Just like Western and Japanese capitalists, the Russian
ruling class is basically driven by the need to accumulate:
&#8216;production for the sake of production&#8217;.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Crises of overproduction are absent because &#8216;organised
capitalism&#8217; allows them to be avoided in the USSR. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Furthermore, general crises of overproduction do not exist
in the imperialist countries either, in view of the tendency towards
&#8216;organised capitalism&#8217; and the importance of the armaments
sector in their economies.
</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">Events over the last 15 years have inflicted one cruel blow after
the other on these dogmatic assertions. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> The generalised
recessions of the world capitalist economy in 1974&#8211;5 and 1980&#8211;2
were truly classic crises of overproduction, the mitigating effects
of inflation notwithstanding. In scale they exceeded, rather than
being below, the average capitalist crisis of overproduction of the
last century and a half. What then remains of the myth of &#8216;organised
capitalism&#8217; and Hilferding&#8217;s <em>Generalkartell</em>?</p>

<p>Nothing similar has taken place in the USSR. If there is a crisis
in that country it is one of underproduction of use values (of
scarcity) and not one of overproduction of exchange values (of
commodities). To claim that the first is only a variant of the second
is a gross fallacy. An empty shop is not &#8216;a variant&#8217; of a shop
stuffed full of unsellable goods.</p>

<p>A process of restoration of capitalism is under way in several
East European countries. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> In at least one country, the GDR, that
process is almost complete. Literally no one in these countries, or
in the world, denies the evidence. This presents the followers of the
theory of state capitalism with an insoluble problem: how is it
possible under capitalism to restore capitalism?</p>

<p>They try to get out of this difficulty by claiming that &#8216;private
capitalism&#8217; is different from &#8216;state capitalism&#8217;. But that only
pushes the problem one stage further back: either the difference
between &#8216;state&#8217; and &#8216;private&#8217; capitalism is a qualitative one
&#8211; in which case, why use the same concept to cover both? Or the
difference is purely quantitative. In which case, the whole initial
problem re-emerges more strongly. Can one seriously argue that there
was only a quantitative difference between the GDR and the Federal
Republic? Does the Federal Republic&#8217;s <em>Anschluss</em> change
nothing basic in the GDR&#8217;s actual socio-economic system? Are the
societies of North and South Korea qualitatively the same?</p>

<p>To reduce the nature of capitalism simply to the wish to
accumulate (&#8216;production for the sake of production&#8217;) is to
dismiss much of Volumes 1 and 3 of <strong>Capital</strong>, and the whole of
Volume 2. Capitalist production is generalised commodity production.
Every commodity contains within itself a contradiction between use
value and exchange value, as well as a contradiction between
commodity and money. An &#8216;organised capitalism&#8217; that overcame
these contradictions would no longer be capitalism, at least not in
the sense analysed and defined by Marx.</p>

<p>Capital exists and can only exist with money-capital as its
starting point. Capital is value looking to increase in value, to
surplus value. Of necessity it must eventually recover its initial
money form, despite the fact that while engaged in the production
process it no longer has that form. Without money there can be no
capital accumulation.</p>

<p>These are not esoteric abstractions. We are at the heart of the
matter. It is of no use for a capitalist just to make the workers he
exploits produce the maximum of surplus value. He cannot transform a
car pound or warehouses full of colour televisions into additional
machines or steel, or into wages for extra workers, or into private
jets for his own consumption. He cannot accumulate capital simply by
producing surplus value. He must realise that surplus value through
the sale of the commodities that have been produced in order to
accumulate capital. As Marx says, the process of (expanded)
reproduction, that is to say, the process of accumulation, is the
unity of both the process of production and the process of
realisation of surplus value. These two never coincide automatically.
Without the process of realisation no accumulation is possible. What
makes periodic crises of overproduction inevitable is the inevitable
contradiction between the two poles of this unity. Moreover, the same
contradiction activates a series of mechanisms typical of the
capitalist economy. These were carefully analysed by Marx and can be
called &#8216;the laws of motion&#8217; of the capitalist economy.</p>

<p>To know whether a society is basically capitalist or not we have
therefore to ask the question (and back it up factually): are the
laws of capitalist motion in evidence?</p>

<p>Just to point to the extraction of surplus labour from the direct
producers is insufficient. At night all cats are grey. For thousands
of years since primitive communism surplus labour has always been
extracted from the direct producers, and this will continue until we
reach the future classless socialist society. But that does not make
all these societies capitalist. Marx says that in the last analysis
the nature of each society (except classless society) is determined
by the specific form in which surplus labour is extracted (<strong>Marx
Engels Works</strong>, Vol.&nbsp;27, p.&nbsp;799). And under capitalism
that takes the specific form of the transformation of labour power
into a commodity, of its sale to capitalists for money, of
capitalists buying the means of production for money, of the
appropriation by these same capitalists of the products of wage
labour, and of the sale of these commodities in order to make roughly
the average profit. Without all these specific mechanisms, capitalism
does not exist for Marx, at least not as a dominant mode of
production.</p>

<p>Our interpretation of the present day capitalist economy and of
present day Soviet economy allows the inner coherence of Marxist
theory to be preserved. Cliff&#8217;s theory destroys any type of
coherence unless essential elements of Marxist theory are jettisoned.
So whatever advantage it claims in explaining the USSR is lost when
it comes to explaining present day capitalism.</p>

<p>The idea of the bureaucracy as a ruling class really has to be
taken with a smile after what has happened in Hungary, Poland and the
GDR (to quote only those examples). Has any ruling class in history
ever been seen to literally tiptoe away from the stage of society, as
a significant section of the <em>nomenklatura</em> in those countries
is now doing?</p>

<p>According to chapter one of Volume 1 of <strong>Capital</strong>, a
commodity is only a commodity because it is the product of private
acts of labour performed independently one from the other. To present
the Soviet economy in terms of a capitalist economy therefore implies
that industrial labour there consists of &#8216;private acts of labour
performed independently one from the other&#8217;: an absurd description
if ever there was one.</p>

<p>To say that an act of labour is private means that no capitalist
(firm) knows whether the labour costs expended (both living and dead)
will be recognised as socially necessary costs, that is to say,
whether they will be paid for by society. It is only after the sale
of the commodities that the capitalist learns whether he has gained
or lost. If the labour expended has been socially necessary, he
obtains an average profit. If social labour has been wasted, he gets
less than the average profit or goes bankrupt.</p>

<p>At the first sign of sale at a loss or of below average profits,
he attempts to change the way in which production is organised. He
will try to improve the technology, to use better machines, to save
on raw materials and energy, to extract more surplus labour from his
workforce, to spread his investments, to get access to cheaper
credit, and so on. The organisation of labour depends in the first
place on the private decisions of the factory owner, which is then
corrected by competition, by the market. He has to submit to these
corrections or face extinction. Under capitalism there is only one
overall measure of performance &#8211; realised profit. The more
productivity is raised, and the lower the costs of production, the
greater the likelihood that his profit will outstrip that of his
competitors. But there is nothing automatic about this. It is the
post-sale profits that determine everything. The capitalist economy
is an economy based on profit, and profit can only be realised and
measured in the form of money.</p>

<p>This is where the famous &#8216;law of value&#8217; enters into play. It
determines the social nature of labour through commodities exchanging
at equivalent values and so operates under capitalism as the tendency
to create an average rate of profit. Capitals move out of enterprises
and sectors of below average profit into those of above average
profit. Thus, as Harman himself emphasises, the essential function of
the law of value under capitalism is to ensure that productive
resources are allocated through objective mechanisms, these being
imposed on enterprises and capitalists, as well as on workers, behind
their backs and independently of their will and decisions.</p>

<p>However, the law of value only rules any economy in so far as it
is one of generalised commodity production, that is, one in which
labour is basically private labour. In pre-capitalist societies this
is not the case. Here the law of value is not determinant, even if it
has already begun to influence economic decisions. A French peasant
of the 11th century, a Russian peasant of the 18th century, or a
Peruvian peasant of the first half of the 20th century, does not
alter his decisions to sow or reap in line with the price of wheat
rising or falling, for the simple reason that 95 percent of his
production is not for the market. In these societies the bulk of
productive resources are directly allocated to different sectors by
those who control the means of production. Direct, <em>a priori</em>
allocation is the opposite of <em>a posteriori</em> allocation brought
about through the law of value. This difference between two methods
of resource allocation marks the opposition between planning and the market.</p>

<p>In the USSR the essential investments are not decided via the law
of value. They are decided by the bureaucracy, mostly at state level.
It is a planned economy (that implies no value judgement: an economy
can be planned in an irrational, even senseless manner) as far as
direct allocation of resources is concerned. For 70 years, &#8216;loss&#8217;
making enterprises requiring large subsidies have received a
preferential allocation of productive resources. These have been
systematically diverted from &#8216;more profitable&#8217; enterprises or
sectors. Such phenomena are unthinkable under capitalism and the rule
of the law of value. But if the law of value does not rule &#8216;directly&#8217;
in the USSR, does it do so &#8216;indirectly&#8217; through the intermediary
of the world market?</p>

<p>Dogmatically, as if it were a revealed truth, Cliff and Harman
claim this to be the case. They cannot prove it. Any rule of the law
of value &#8216;through the intermediary of the world market&#8217; has to
operate via trade, like anything to do with capitalism. Enterprises
that fail to compete with imported goods are doomed to go under. At
least two thirds, if not more, of Soviet enterprises do not compete
with imperialist enterprises. If they were subject to the law of
value operating &#8216;through the intermediary of the world market&#8217;,
they would be forced to close (like Mexican steelworks or British
coal mines). There is therefore no &#8216;rule of the law of value&#8217; in
the USSR &#8216;through the intermediary of the world market&#8217;.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A hybrid economy</h4>

<p class="fst">However, even though the functioning of the Soviet economy is not
dominated by the law of value, it cannot abstract itself from its
influence. While it is not a capitalist economy, that is, an economy
based on generalised commodity production, neither is it a socialist
economy geared to the direct satisfaction of human need, an economy
in which labour possesses an immediately social character. It is a
post-capitalist economy with elements of the market. Partial survival
of commodity production is combined with the partial rule of the
direct allocation of productive resources.</p>

<p>This combination is hybrid and contradictory. It implies that the
fate of the USSR as a transitional society between capitalism and
socialism, &#8216;frozen&#8217; at its present stage by the bureaucratic
dictatorship, has not yet been settled historically. A social
counter-revolution can pull the USSR back towards capitalism. A
victorious anti-bureaucratic political revolution can push it in the
direction of socialism (no more than that: socialism in one country
is impossible no matter how pure, democratic, revolutionary or
internationalist a government based on workers&#8217; power may be).</p>
<p>Comrades from the Socialist Workers Party in Britain (SWP) find
this notion of hybrid combination, the perpetuation of which lacks
all certainty, this &#8216;transition between two progressive modes of
production&#8217; (to quote Marx&#8217;s celebrated formula), difficult to
accept and understand. They are quite wrong. We are talking here of a
phenomenon that has occurred in practically every epoch when a given
mode of production has entered its historical period of decline and decay.</p>

<p>To give just one example &#8211; between the decline of the feudal
mode of production and the triumph of capitalism a transitional epoch
intervened in which petty commodity production dominated, stretching
over several centuries. Petty commodity production has its own
characteristics which are neither those of feudalism (serfdom) or of
capitalism (wage labour). The predominant form of labour is the free
labour of small proprietors or semi-proprietors, owning their own
means of production.</p>

<p>We are not talking here of a new mode of production able to
perpetuate itself automatically. Petty commodity production is
capable of regression towards feudalism, which is what happened in a
large area of central and eastern Europe from the 16th century
onwards, the period of the &#8216;second serfdom&#8217;. It is also capable
of moving towards capitalism, that is towards the predominance of
wage labour, which is what happened in the Netherlands and in England
from the 17th and 18th centuries onwards. But in both cases the small
independent producers disappeared only little by little.</p>

<p>The same rule can be applied more or less to the period of
transition between capitalism and socialism. Either what remains of
commodity production will finally eliminate most of the direct
appropriation and allocation of the social surplus product &#8211; in
which case, capitalism will be restored. Or society will throw off
the deadweight of the bureaucracy and ensure that the direct
appropriation and allocation of major resources for the satisfaction
of needs as democratically decided by the masses will predominate &#8211;
in which case, the unavoidable survival of some market mechanisms
will no longer be able to put a brake on genuine progress towards
socialism. But in both cases, what is specific about today&#8217;s hybrid
Soviet situation will have largely disappeared.</p>

<p>Once again, it is not a question of some abstract theoretical
schema. Our understanding of the principal causes of the specific
economic crisis characteristic of the USSR is rooted in reality.
Current mystification notwithstanding, what the Soviet economy
suffers from is at one and the same time too little central planning
(democratic planning, let it be understood, not bureaucratic
planning) and too little of the market (in all those areas where as a
result of the inadequate objective socialisation of labour direct
allocation of resources does not operate and the market is required
to break up monopolies). <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>The despotic nature of planning from the First Five Year Plan
onwards meant that it was marked by colossal disproportions, the
cumulative effect of which in the end undermined even the very
targets set by the bureaucracy. The market or pseudo-market
mechanisms used have always lacked a proper foundation largely
because there is no unified pricing system and no stable currency.
The double pricing system is an accurate reflection of the hybrid
dualism of the Soviet economy. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p>Comrade Cliff&#8217;s analysis makes much of the importance of the
world market for the Soviet economy. But the world market is not some
disembodied Holy Ghost hovering above the clouds in order to create
the world, as the Bible boldly tells us. One of the essential
contributions that Marx and Marxism have brought to the social
sciences is the categorical rejection of any kind of reification of
economic categories. One of the essential gains of historical
materialism is to discover behind these categories relations between
social groups (social classes and major class fractions). The
connections between them and the way they struggle for their
interests strips bare the secret of economic categories, including
that of the world market.</p>

<p>In this respect, the theory put forward by Trotsky and the Fourth
International, that the fate of the USSR and so of its economy has
not yet been definitely settled, is based on a precise understanding
of international class struggle in the 20th century. Cliffs theory
largely empties the interconnection between international class
struggle and what has happened in the USSR of its significance.</p>

<p>Trotsky predicted in 1905&#8211;6 that the imperialist chain would
first break in Russia because its proletariat was subjectively
stronger than the proletariat in Germany and other countries.
Objectively, however, the conditions for an advance towards socialism
were infinitely worse in Russia than in any of the major
industrialised countries in the world. Therefore either the
victorious Russian revolution would join up with a victorious
revolution in some of these countries, in which case the proletariat
would retain political power. Or it would not, in which case the
Russian proletariat would lose political power.</p>

<p>But what would be the precise form of the counter-revolution in
Russia? Again, that did not depend first and foremost on the forces
present in that country alone, but on the relationship of social and
political forces at a world level. The imperialist bourgeoisie was
strong enough to prevent (or, what amounts to the same thing, the
leadership of the proletariat was too weak to ensure) the victory of
the revolution in Germany, Austria, Italy, Britain, France and Spain.
It was not, however, in a position to crush the world working class
movement. Overall, it was only strong enough to crush the workers&#8217;
movement in Germany and Spain with the victory of fascism, but even
that was only temporary.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Russian bourgeoisie had been too weakened, and
the international bourgeoisie was too divided, to make a success of
restoring capitalism by civil war, foreign intervention or the direct
pressure of the world market. In part, this effort was neutralised by
the intervention and pressure of the world proletariat. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> What
followed as a result was a relative world equilibrium of class
forces. These conditions meant that a political counter-revolution
(Thermidor) took place in Russia, but not a social one. The
proletariat lost political power but it was not an old or new
capitalist class which benefitted but, to use Marx&#8217;s formula,
functionaries who rose from the ranks of the working class itself.</p>

<p>In the long term, this relative equilibrium of class forces cannot
last. Either the international working class will make decisive moves
forward to socialist revolution in key countries of the world, in
which case any restoration of capitalism will become impossible in
the USSR. Or the world proletariat will experience crushing defeats,
not necessarily in the precise form of the Nazi victory in Germany
but with similar consequences, namely the elimination for a long
period of its capacity for resistance and collective and organised
action. If that happens the restoration of capitalism in the USSR is
inevitable. Given this perspective, the role of the Soviet working
class itself, its capacity to react, to resist and move onto the
counter-offensive, will become more and more important.</p>

<p>Chris Harman criticises us by quoting an extract from an article
written in 1956, in which we stated that the Soviet economy grows in
a regular rhythm and that this shows its superiority to the
capitalist economy. Extracting a single quotation on a topic which an
author has written about for more than 40 years is not a serious way
to debate. We could quite easily refer to ten or so passages in which
we predicted that the rate of growth in the Soviet economy would
fall. One quotation will do:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The disproportion between the development of light
industry and that of heavy industry, which underlies the bureaucratic
form of management, has become a deep-going weakness in the economic
system. Its repercussions on the development of heavy industry itself
... are becoming bigger and bigger. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">So have we changed our mind on this matter? Is there a
contradiction in our analysis? Not at all. The quotation and the
method used by Harman can be turned against him. If one examines the
real growth curve of the Soviet economy from 1928 onwards (excepting
the years of Nazi aggression against the USSR 1941&#8211;44), it will be
seen: a) that growth really was regular and uninterrupted; b) that
unlike the capitalist economy the USSR has experienced no recession,
no crisis of overproduction leading to an absolute fall in
production, for more than 60 years <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a>, c) that the rate of growth
began to fall 20 years ago; d) that this fall may become &#8216;zero
growth&#8217;, but that there is no &#8216;law&#8217; making this inevitable. It
so happens, then, that we did predict this fall in the rate of growth
and our analysis of the Soviet economy (and of Soviet society)
accounts perfectly for both aspects of the tendency.</p>

<p>Cliff&#8217;s explanation, on the other hand, starts from a confusion
in analysis and terminology and relies on false statistical data.
Under capitalism, the lash of competition and of class struggle leads
capitalists to increase the organic composition of capital. In the
first instance they replace living by dead labour, i.e. by machines,
in order to sell more cheaply on the market. In the second they can
raise the rate of surplus value by subjecting workers to the pressure
of unemployment. The rise in the organic composition of capital, and
the resultant tendency of the rate of profit to fall, are the
consequence and not the cause of this behaviour. The cause lies in
the nature of the system itself: production for the sake of profit.
This takes us back again to money-capital, which is the starting
point for the reproduction cycle of capital and its end point.</p>

<p>In other words, without competition between capitalist firms, none
of this dynamic would exist, or would only exist on an extremely
limited scale. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> Marx was explicit on the subject. He writes in
Volume 3 of <strong>Capital</strong> that without competition &#8216;the fire that
keeps production alive&#8217; (and a fortiori accumulation) would be
extinguished. Let us add that Marx believed that capitalism can only
exist in the form of &#8216;many capitals&#8217;, which in turn inevitably
implies competition. Marx was also quite unambiguous about the point
that competition involves exchange, that competition is only possible
through exchange. So where is the &#8216;exchange&#8217; between Soviet arms
and imperialist goods?</p>

<p>The use of the term &#8216;military competition&#8217; as equivalent to
competition for the realisation of profit arises from a
characteristic semantic confusion. In reality, for &#8216;military
competition&#8217; to be capitalist competition, it must operate via the
world market. That would mean the USSR being forced to buy arms or
the machines necessary for the production of arms from abroad, which
would mean that Soviet factories producing these arms or machines
would have to close if they worked at too high a cost price. This has
clearly not been the case in the USSR for 70 years. Quite the
contrary. No arms factory or factory making machines for arms has
closed, irrespective of whether costs were known to be higher than
those in the USA, Germany or Japan.</p>

<p>All this proves once again that the Soviet economy is not governed
by the law of value. And so one cannot speak of &#8216;competition&#8217;
with capitalist countries in the economic Marxist sense of the word
when dealing with the arms race.</p>

<p>Do the figures quoted by Harman agree with reality? Not at all.
What they reflect is the systematic attempt to camouflage the reality
of the Soviet economy which the bureaucracy has carried out since the
Stalin era. This has misled both apologists like Maurice Dobb and
critics like Bordiga and Cliff. The aim of this mystification is to
disguise the essentially parasitic and wasteful role of bureaucratic management.</p>

<p>The theoretical error which allows this statistical falsification
is the reduction of the Soviet economy to a system having two instead
of three sectors (Department III includes unproductive consumption
and &#8216;accumulation&#8217;, while Department I consists of means of
production and Department II of the means of consumption consumed by
the producers, that is to say productive consumption). With a two
sector scheme, productive and unproductive consumption, investment
which leads to expanded reproduction and investment which serves no
economic purpose in reproduction are carelessly added together and
jumbled up.</p>

<p>Here is an example, deliberately chosen from outside armaments
production. When a steelmill produces bars of steel which
&#8216;accumulate&#8217; in warehouses (or, better still, in the open air)
and remain there, one cannot speak of &#8216;accumulation&#8217; in any
economic sense of the word. Using the term &#8216;capital accumulation&#8217;
in this connection would make any real capitalist laugh. It is
clearly waste production from a social point of view. It is also
waste production from the point of view of those who control the economy.</p>

<p>Sheer wastage of products and resources occupies an enormous space
in the Soviet economy. Calculation of its size is not easy, but the
most critical economists have put forward the figure of between 30
and 40 percent of available productive resources (including human
resources: a third of all paid hours of work result in no real
production). Here we have the &#8216;secret&#8217; of the command economy, of
pseudo- or semi-planning in the USSR: it is Department III which is
overexpanded, not Department I.</p>

<p>Let us take one concrete example among many. The USSR is the
biggest producer of chemical fertiliser in the world. It produces
nearly as much as the USA and Western Europe put together. Does this
imply overexpansion of Department I (chemical fertiliser, being a raw
material, is part of Department I)? Not at all. More than half this
production is lost &#8216;in transit&#8217;. It never reaches the user and so
is never incorporated into any force of production or reproduction. A
product of labour whose use value is not realised has no exchange
value. So asserts Marx for commodity production. To extend this
analysis to any society not governed by the law of value, to say it
is simply a sheer waste of social resources, is to echo the spirit of
his thought still more strongly. Such wastage has nothing to do with
any supposed &#8216;allocation of productive resources by the law of
value&#8217; or with any drive to &#8216;accumulate capital&#8217;.</p>

<p>Back will come the retort, but what about armaments production
under capitalism? Isn&#8217;t that also waste production of productive
resources? Wouldn&#8217;t capitalism which incorporates the arms race as
a more or less permanent feature be a capitalism which develops the
forces of destruction rather than the forces of production? <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a> Our
answer to this objection is at several levels.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the individual capitalist firm involved
in arms production this is not waste. Such commodities find buyers in
so far as these buyers (the state or arms dealers) wish to realise
their use value. So they possess an exchange value which creates real
profit. Otherwise they wouldn&#8217;t be produced under capitalism anyway.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t what the firm producing arms finds &#8216;useful&#8217;
irrational, even inhuman, from the social point of view? Undoubtedly.
But this is absolutely characteristic of capitalism. The
contradiction between the partial rationality and the global
irrationality of economic activity is developed to the extreme. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a>
The same point can be made about drugs, cigarettes, polluting
automobiles, chemical fertilisers, nuclear power stations, and so on.</p>

<p>Is arms production &#8216;unproductive&#8217; from the point of view of
the capitalist economy as a whole? That is, doesn&#8217;t it fail to
increase the mass of surplus value, of profit-source and of capital,
which is the only definition of &#8216;productive&#8217; from the point of
view of capital as a whole? Not necessarily. When a mass of
productive resources lies idle the effect of expanding Department III
can be to mobilise these resources and so increase the total mass of
surplus value and of profits. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a> That is clearly what happened in
the United States from 1940 onwards. It would be absurd to deny that
capitalism, and indeed bourgeois American society, was more
prosperous in 1944 (not to say in 1950) than in 1933.</p>

<p>Does that mean that capitalism has been transformed into a &#8216;waste
economy&#8217;? Only partially. Besides there is nothing new about this.
Marx already stated in the Grundrisse and in Capital that capitalism
can only develop the production of material wealth by simultaneously
undermining the two sources of all wealth: human productive force and
nature. During the rise of capitalism the &#8216;positive&#8217; effects of
growth outweighed the destructive ones. In its period of decline,
from 1914 at least, the opposite has been the case. Yet growth since
1949 (in the USA since 1940) has not been any the less real. The
extra amount of foodstuff, textiles, medicines, housing and domestic
appliances produced in the last 40 years is genuine and colossal. To
label this as &#8216;forces of destruction&#8217; is absurd, non-materialist
and non-Marxist.</p>

<p>Should one conclude from this that it is a matter of indifference,
economically speaking, whether society produces means of destruction
or means of production? Such a conclusion is not justified either.
The iron laws of reproduction continue to operate in a commodity
production system of whatever type (including the partial commodity
production system of the USSR, as in any country in a period of
transition between capitalism and socialism).</p>

<p>One cannot produce wheat with teargas, dresses with tanks, or
television sets with rockets. The dimensions of Department III are
bound to have repercussions on the dimensions of Departments I and
II. The utilisation of any productive resource for the manufacture of
armaments entails its removal from production of the means of
production and of consumption. Production in Department III therefore
cannot be developed beyond a certain point without in the end
reducing production in the other two Departments, thereby strangling
expanded reproduction and so the accumulation of capital.</p>

<p>What is true of capitalist society is also true of pre-capitalist
society. And in as much as armaments production persists (or other
forms of wastage appear on a grand scale) it applies to
post-capitalist society as well.</p>

<p>For thousands of years in pre-capitalist societies, wars led to
famine and to an absolute decline in production which was temporary
or long lasting depending on the period and the circumstances. In the
USSR the over-expansion in Department III of armaments production and
unproductive expenses in general (above all administrative expenses,
ie the cost of the bureaucracy) puts a brake on the overall
development of material production.</p>
<p>In the end it even chokes off growth, including growth in the arms
sector. This is for two reasons: it takes away vital resources for
the development of Departments I and II; and it increases the
producers&#8217; dissatisfaction with their given level of consumption
(even if this rises in a modest way), such that their lack of concern
about overall production results becomes ever greater. Under
capitalism, this lack of concern is partly neutralised by fear of
redundancy and unemployment, something which has played no role in
the USSR for more than half a century. Instead, therefore, alongside
each producer had to be placed a supervisor, a foreman, a cop. Hence
the enormously swollen size of the &#8216;petty&#8217; bureaucracy, amounting
to about 20 million people, it can be reckoned, since Trotsky&#8217;s
time. Hence also the colossal and permanent growth of unproductive
expense: Department III is biting its own tail like the legendary serpent.</p>

<p>This mechanism cannot be &#8216;reformed&#8217;, as Gorbachev has
discovered to his cost. The serpent can only be slain by the spread
of strictly public, popular working class control, and by the spread
of genuine working class management in a multiparty socialist democracy.</p>

<p>A schematic system of thought which only operates in black and red
and which is the prisoner of outrageously simplistic abstractions is
incapable of handling the categories of &#8216;transition&#8217;, of
&#8216;combined and uneven development&#8217; and of &#8216;contradictory
reality&#8217;. In other words, such thought is undialectical. This
unfortunately is the way in which Tony Cliff and Chris Harman think,
at least when dealing with general problems.</p>

<p>Moreover there is something irrational, even positively
irresponsible, in the SWP comrades&#8217; vituperative attacks on
accelerated industrialisation in the USSR from 1927 onwards. This is
clear to the naked eye for every worker, peasant and Marxist from
Third World countries, and for every true internationalist.</p>

<p>Each one of us is against &#8216;overinvestment&#8217;, against
&#8216;gigantism&#8217;, against Stalinist and post-Stalinist
&#8216;superindustrialisation&#8217;, most of which represent a total loss of
expenditure in material resources. But we are not against accelerated
industrialisation as such in these countries or in Russia, which was
the first to opt for it, after the October revolution. To turn one&#8217;s
back on this industrialisation would mean not just rejecting the
whole short and medium term trend in economic policy elaborated by
Lenin, Trotsky and the Left Opposition after 1923. Above all it would
mean condemning those countries to flounder in barbarism while they
wait for the victory of the world revolution. But when would that
come about? After five years? After ten years? After 20 years? After
30 years? Who knows? Must we in the meantime fold our arms and
tolerate the intolerable?</p>

<p>When we speak of intolerable barbarism we are not speaking
loosely. Underdevelopment kills 16 million children in the Third
World each year. How many children would die each year if development
took place in these countries on the basis of a democratically run
socialised economy? The <em>Generalplan Ost</em> of Nazi-led German
imperialism envisaged the extermination of 100 million people in
central and Eastern Europe. Was it wrong not to have laid down
conditions for successful resistance against this projected monstrous
crime, notably by developing a powerful industry in the Urals and
beyond? By rejecting a sense of proportion (the difference between
necessary accelerated industrialisation and disproportionate,
wasteful and destructive superindustrialisation), which breaks with
dialectical thinking, the SWP comrades put themselves in an
impossible situation with respect to their own objectives.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that one day they succeed in leading the British
working class to a seizure of power. What type of society would
emerge from this victorious revolution? A socialist society? Have the
SWP comrades been suddenly converted to the reactionary Utopia of
socialism in one country? A state capitalist society because of &#8216;the
pressure of competition from the world market&#8217;? Workers&#8217; power
would scarcely be in a position to counter this pressure in Great
Britain alone. Would their efforts then have been in vain? A
socialist society by virtue of the fact that the British revolution
would immediately spread to the rest of the world? But if that does
not happen, or at least not for some time, wouldn&#8217;t Britain then be
a transitional society between capitalism and socialism which all
advanced workers and communists/socialists would unite in an effort
to protect from the dangers of bureaucratisation, even if they
couldn&#8217;t eliminate them entirely? What is the point of rejecting
today the very concept which one would be forced to apply tomorrow?
And wouldn&#8217;t the funds for accumulation, productive as well as
unproductive, have to be sufficient to meet (at least partially) the
requirements to invest in order to satisfy the needs of the masses
and to defend them against imperialism?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t reducing this whole complex problematic simply to the
question of the &#8216;pressure of the world market&#8217; result in
paralysis, even suicide, for the SWP and for any victorious British
revolution? In the imperfect world in which we live it is impossible
to find one&#8217;s bearings or to act in a revolutionary manner without
resorting to such categories as &#8216;transition&#8217;, &#8216;transitional
programme&#8217;, &#8216;transitional demands&#8217; and &#8216;transitional
society&#8217;. The all or nothing approach acts as a blindfold. It also
inhibits revolutionary action, no matter how limited in effect.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The specific character of the Soviet bureaucracy</h4>

<p class="fst">According to Cliff and Harman, the Soviet bureaucracy is
characterised by the tendency to excess production of the means of
production, the tendency to &#8216;production for the sake of
production&#8217;. The idea which they object to (and attribute to us) is
the claim that the economic development of the USSR is dominated by
the production of consumption goods (luxury goods) for the
bureaucracy. We have never defended such an extreme thesis. In no
society (including slave or feudal society) does what motivates the
ruling class or group &#8211; the desire to increase its own consumption
&#8211; explain or exhaust the dynamic of the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>In order to preserve and extend its privileges, the Soviet
bureaucracy, just like any ruling class or group in history, has to
develop the economy up to a certain point. Without car factories 3
million middle and top bureaucrats cannot acquire cars. Without
enough steel, electricity or iron ore, the car industry cannot be
developed satisfactorily. True, one could try and import these goods.
But that would mean having to export in order to obtain resources,
which would mean submitting to the law of value and to the world
market. In that situation an underdeveloped country remains basically
an underdeveloped country, unable either to industrialise beyond a
certain limit or buy a sufficient number of cars.</p>

<p>In order to avoid just this kind of constraint (to escape the
constraints of the world market), the Soviet bureaucracy unleashed a
process of &#8216;superindustrialisation&#8217; in the USSR. Without this, it
could not have defended, consolidated or extended its powers and
privileges as spectacularly as it did after 1928.</p>

<p>This is the framework necessary to understand the socio-political
struggles that have taken place in the USSR over the last 60 years.
The struggle has been three way, not two way (&#8216;between capital and
labour&#8217;). When the profound crises of 1928&#8211;33, 1941&#8211;44 and
1945&#8211;48 shook Soviet society and the power of the bureaucracy, on
every occasion the bureaucracy struck simultaneously at both the
bourgeoisie and the working class. It did the same in Eastern Europe.
It did not simply &#8216;overexploit the working class&#8217;, it also
expropriated the bourgeoisie. Historically it has played an
autonomous role.</p>

<p>The real theoretical debate turns on the extent of this relative
autonomy and how long it can last. For believers in the theory of
&#8216;bureaucratic collectivism&#8217;, this autonomy is identical with that
of a ruling class in history. For Trotsky, as for us, it is much more
limited, both in time and scope. But that does not make it any the
less genuine, much more genuine than the majority of Marxists thought
possible before 1927. To persist in ignoring this today is to deprive
oneself of an explanation of what has actually happened in the USSR
since then.</p>

<p>The fourth great crisis in the history of the bureaucratised USSR
is now unfolding. It remains to be seen whether the three way
struggle continues (we think it will), or whether, as many
commentators and tendencies believe, the <em>nomenklatura</em> will go
over into the camp of the international bourgeoisie lock, stock and
barrel and become its resident junior partner (very junior: look at
the GDR!).</p>

<p>Be that as it may, ends and means have to be clearly distinguished
in this complex social struggle: what the fundamental driving force
is, what means are used to fulfil the ends chosen, and what the
objective results are of the interaction between ends and means. And
here we are forced to return to the conclusion &#8211; a conclusion
moreover which corresponds to Marx&#8217;s definition &#8211; that only under
the lash of competition has the bourgeoisie a permanent and lasting
stake in the continuous expansion of production. Without this
constant pressure, no pre-capitalist ruling class showed any such
tendency (nor, we would add, does the bureaucratic caste in the USSR).</p>

<p>As long as the shortage of consumption goods kept them thirsty for
more, the bureaucrats were fanatical about accumulation, about
&#8216;production for the sake of production&#8217; and about &#8216;technological
progress&#8217; (as sections of the middle bureaucracy, in their greed
for an American yuppie lifestyle, still are today). But as soon as
the <em>nomenklatura</em> as a whole had reached a satisfactory level
of consumption (&#8216;when socialism had been achieved for its benefit&#8217;)
this thirst began to disappear. &#8216;Productivist fanaticism&#8217;
dwindled. A stage of what the Hungarian Stalinist ex-prime minister,
Hegedus, correctly called &#8216;generalised irresponsibility&#8217; set in.</p>

<p>This also explains why Soviet managers, unlike their capitalist
counterparts, nearly always and almost automatically give in to wage
demands in the workplace: no pressure of competition forces them to
&#8216;extract the maximum surplus value&#8217; from the workers. The only
pressure they are under is to &#8216;avoid problems&#8217; when it comes to
fulfilling the plan. It is in order to bring about a thorough change
in their attitude that Gorbachev and his ilk have been trying to
introduce all the technocratic changes of perestroika. However, as
the most consistent supporters of perestroika and of out and out
&#8216;economic liberalisation&#8217;, both East and West, have clearly
understood, radical &#8216;structural reform&#8217; cannot be fulfilled
without a massive return to private property.</p>

<p>Without competition and the drive to private accumulation which it
sets in motion the behaviour of the bureaucrats in the East will in
essence never be like that of capitalist bosses. At best they will
act like gangsters trying to legalise theft and extortion (&#8216;trying
to go legit&#8217;). And if they embark on all out privatisation, which
would mean making tens of millions of people unemployed in the USSR,
they will have to break the resistance of the working class.</p>

<p>This proves that a genuine &#8216;three way struggle&#8217; is still
taking place in the USSR. It proves that, despite everything, workers
still have at least two &#8216;gains&#8217; from the October revolution to
defend: more than half a century of uninterrupted full employment
(which has never existed in capitalist society and never will exist);
and the abolition of private property in large scale production,
without which this full employment cannot be achieved.</p>

<p>By dogmatically and unrealistically defining the bureaucracy as a
&#8216;capitalist class&#8217; the SWP comrades are unable to grasp what is
specific about the Soviet bureaucracy. The bureaucracy differs from
the bourgeois class, indeed from all ruling classes in history, by
virtue of the fact that the income of those classes (its portion of
the social product) is variable, while that of the bureaucrats is
fixed. The annual profits of the bourgeoisie depend on the annual
fluctuations in profit and production. The annual feudal rent
depended on annual fluctuations in the harvests. The annual income of
the bureaucrat depends on his (or her) position in the hierarchy. If
that position does not change, the income does not change either,
except marginally.</p>

<p>Hence the conservatism, inertia and &#8216;irresponsibility&#8217; of the
bureaucracy in stark contrast to the behaviour of the capitalist
entrepreneur. The latter behaves differently not because he is &#8216;more
aggressive&#8217; or &#8216;more rational&#8217;, &#8216;better&#8217; or &#8216;worse&#8217;
than the bureaucrat, or more of an &#8216;individualist&#8217;. He does so
because capitalist competition means that the struggle over the
distribution of the mass of surplus value and profit is never
eliminated, which means his share of it can never be guaranteed. If
he slips up on the path of &#8216;technological progress&#8217; or of &#8216;labour
organisation&#8217; the inevitable consequence will be a fall in his
share, if not bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Nothing of what glasnost has come to reveal about the reality of
the Soviet economy has had any light shed on it by the myths of
&#8216;state capitalism&#8217;, myths which are only the reverse side of the
Stalinist coin about the &#8216;achievements of socialist
industrialisation&#8217;. All can be explained in the light of the
analysis made by Trotsky and the Fourth International of Soviet
society and the Soviet economy, and of the analysis underpinning it
of the specific nature of the Soviet bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Harman claims that nowhere in history has a section of the
producing class been involved in the &#8216;maximum extraction of surplus
labour&#8217; from the producers themselves. Without doubt, the Soviet
bureaucracy is an unprecedented phenomenon historically. But the
October revolution and the creation of the isolated Russian workers&#8217;
state were also new phenomena lacking historical precedent (the Paris
Commune lasted only a few months). People with a scientific and
undogmatic outlook should not be surprised if a new historical
development throws up new and unexpected by-products.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the question of &#8216;maximum extraction of surplus
labour&#8217;. The proportion of working class consumption in the USSR is
much bigger than in Brazil, to take just one example of a country
engaged in accelerated industrialisation (not that of working class
and middle class consumption put together: the middle classes consume
ten times more than workers and account for 20 percent of the population).</p>

<p>Let us call to mind a simple analogy (which is not to say it is
identical, just analogous). For any socialist or trade unionist in
1848 or 1890 the idea of socialist party leaders or reactionary trade
union leaders acting so as to objectively increase the &#8216;extraction
of surplus labour from the producers&#8217; would have appeared literally
unthinkable. Yet that is what social democratic leaders have done
since 1914, and a good number of trade union leaders since even
before that date. Should one therefore refuse to call social
democratic parties workers&#8217; parties? Have they become bourgeois
parties, identical with the Conservatives and the Liberals? Is it
possible to engage in class politics in Europe or Japan without
having to defend these parties against the bourgeoisie&#8217;s attempts
to weaken or even periodically crush them?</p>

<p>Must the mass trade unions under the leadership of reformist
traitors be considered as yellow bosses&#8217; unions? The ultra left
have long defended this absurd idea, which the SWP comrades reject as
far as Great Britain is concerned. But why, if it is conceivable to
defend the SPD against fascism, despite its being led by the Noskes,
the assassins of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, is it
&#8216;inconceivable&#8217; to defend the USSR against imperialism?</p>

<p>Chris Harman claims that two arguments we successively put forward
about the bureaucracy are mutually incompatible. The first is that
the bureaucracy is not a ruling class; the second is that it controls
and distributes the bulk of the social surplus in the USSR. But this
incompatibility yet again reflects a formalist, schematic and
simplistically dogmatic manner of thinking.</p>

<p>There have been many cases in history where powerful social layers
controlled and distributed the bulk of the surplus despite not being
the ruling class. For to be a ruling class involves appropriating the
surplus, which is not necessarily the same as controlling or
distributing it. The mandarins at the height of the Chinese Empire
and the imperial bureaucracy in the late Roman Empire were by and
large in control of the centralisation and distribution of the social
surplus. But for all that they were not the ruling classes in these
two societies, because they did not appropriate the major share of
the surplus. At the end of the Third Reich, the Nazi military
bureaucracy certainly controlled the distribution of what was
produced socially. But it was in no sense the ruling class, since the
bulk of the social surplus continued to be appropriated by the
capitalist class. The events which followed showed who was master and
who, despite the appearance of omnipotence, only carried out orders.</p>

<p>Future events will similarly demonstrate that the Soviet
bureaucracy will only be able to become a ruling class by
appropriating to itself the social surplus and the means of
production, that is to say, by turning into &#8216;old fashioned&#8217;
capitalists who own a good chunk of the large scale means of production.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A fear that has proved groundless</h4>

<p class="fst">When he decided to break with the interpretation of Soviet society
formulated by Trotsky and defended by the Fourth International, Tony
Cliff predicted that those who continued to call the USSR a
bureaucratically degenerated workers&#8217; state would be led to
capitulate to Stalinism, in particular to side with the bureaucracy
against workers in revolt. (Incidentally, let us recall that as early
as Stalin&#8217;s death, if not from 1948 onwards, we predicted such revolts.)</p>

<p>Subsequent events have proved this prediction to be groundless.
Neither the Fourth International, nor any of its sections, nor any of
its leading representatives, has even once lined up &#8216;on the side of
the bureaucracy against the masses in revolt&#8217;. We all gave 100
percent support to the workers&#8217; uprising in the GDR in 1953, to the
1956 Hungarian revolution, to the Polish workers&#8217; struggles in the
same year, to the Prague Spring&#8217;s resistance in 1968&#8211;69 to the
Soviet invasion, to the rise of Solidarnosc in 1980&#8211;81 and to its
subsequent struggle against Jaruzelski&#8217;s military coup in Poland,
and to the uprisings in China and Eastern Europe in 1989.</p>

<p>Chris Harman recognises this, moreover. In embarrassment he falls
back on the assertion that we nevertheless might have expressed a
&#8216;preference&#8217; for the Gomulka style method of reform in 1956 to
that of the Hungarian revolution. This is slander. Harman will not be
able to find a single quotation to back up his accusation. We have
been supporters of a political revolution &#8211; a revolution involving
large scale independent mass action and self-organisation &#8211; ever
since we began to take part in debates on the &#8216;nature of the USSR&#8217;
(i.e. since 1945&#8211;6), and remain so. We have never budged an inch
from this position. But the reality of the political mass struggles
in the USSR, Eastern Europe and like societies cannot be reduced to
struggles between the masses and the bureaucracy.</p>

<p>In the USSR, Eastern Europe, China, Cuba and Nicaragua, the
struggles of the last 50 years have also taken place between, on the
one hand, these states and the masses in these countries and, on the
other, the imperialist powers. The theory of state capitalism has
been no kind of guide in these conflicts, to say the least. Its
internal logic would necessarily lead one to view most of these
conflicts as interimperialist and take an absentionist, &#8216;third
camp&#8217; position (which is what Cliff adopted in the Korean War and
which at least some of his followers were tempted to do in the Bay of
Pigs conflict). It is true that during the Vietnamese War he took a
more correct position, but one in flagrant contradiction to the logic
of the theory of &#8216;state capitalism&#8217;.</p>

<p>In these conflicts the popular masses of those countries, starting
with the workers, did not remain neutral. They lined up against
imperialism, despite their hatred of Stalin and his heirs. In
practice they applied Trotsky&#8217;s line of military defence of the
USSR (and the other bureaucratised workers&#8217; states) against
imperialism. They did so in the USSR, in Yugoslavia, in China, in
Vietnam, in Cuba and in Nicaragua. In these confrontations, which
involved tens of millions of workers, the attitude adopted by the few
followers of the theory of &#8216;state capitalism&#8217; was at best
confused and contradictory, at worst plainly counterrevolutionary. If
Soviet workers had had the misfortune to follow these false guides,
none of us would be alive today and no independent workers&#8217;
organisation would exist in Europe, if not in other continents. The
triumph of Nazi barbarism would have destroyed them.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The vicious circle of sectarianism</h4>

<p class="fst">The tendency led by Tony Cliff (from which the SWP came) has seen
its main task ever since its birth as spreading the theory of &#8216;state
capitalism&#8217;. This is the characteristic mark of a sect as defined
by Marx: in order to justify its existence it constructs a shibboleth
out of a particular doctrine and subordinates its activity to the
defence of that shibboleth.</p>

<p>This sectarian deviation has its own logic from which it is almost
impossible to escape. In Britain itself the SWP comrades have been
partially protected from the worst sins of sectarianism because of
their real roots in the working class and because of the size of
their organisation: any type of irresponsible behaviour is impossible
when acting under the critical gaze of thousands. But even in Britain
the sectarian frame of mind has damaged and continues to damage the
SWP, particularly in its approach to those mass movements which it
considers &#8216;non-proletarian&#8217; and carelessly dubs &#8216;petty
bourgeois&#8217;. This derives from the same inability to grasp the
notion of combined development which arises as a transitional
phenomenon, particularly in the sphere of class consciousness. It is
the same &#8216;all or nothing&#8217; attitude which lies at the heart of the
theory of &#8216;state capitalism&#8217;.</p>

<p>Sectarianism has especially damaged the SWP&#8217;s international work
in another way. The theory of state capitalism means that it is
powerless to grasp the full progressive dynamic of the mass
anti-imperialist movements in the Third World. According to that
theory, these movements can only lead in the end to the creation of
new state capitalist states. Their dynamic is a purely
&#8216;nationalistic&#8217; one. The entire strategy of permanent revolution
&#8211; total support for the anti-imperialist struggle while fighting
for the political class independence of the proletariat; a struggle
for proletarian hegemony inside the movement; striving to ensure that
in solving its national-democratic tasks the revolution grows over
into making a start on solving its socialist-proletarian ones &#8211; is
in fact rejected or minimalised by the leadership of the SWP.</p>

<p>In other imperialist countries besides Britain, the followers of
the SWP mostly content themselves with forming grouplets to propagate
the theory of state capitalism, which are incapable, if only because
of their tiny size, of intervening in genuine class struggle.
Sectarian interests take precedence over class interests. The same
applies in the states of Eastern Europe, which are in complete social
and political turmoil. In the <strong>Communist Manifesto</strong> Marx and
Engels provided the classic definition of what communists have to do:</p>

<p class="quoteb">They have no interests separate and apart from those of
the proletariat as a whole.</p>

<p class="quote">They do not set up any special principles [in the 1888
English edition Engels preferred to insert &#8216;sectarian principles&#8217;]
of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.</p>

<p class="quote">The communists are distinguished from the other working
class parties by this only: 1 In the national struggles of the
proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to
the front the common interests of the entire proletariat,
independently of all nationality. 2 In the various stages of
development which the struggle of the working class against the
bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent
the interests of the movement as a whole.</p>

<p class="quote">The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand,
practically, the most advanced and resolute section of the working
class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all
others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great
mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the
tine of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of
the proletarian movement.</p>

<p class="fst">The SWP is no different from the Fourth International when it
comes to &#8216;understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the
ultimate general results of the proletarian movement&#8217; in Eastern
Europe and the USSR: the proletariat organises itself to conquer
power through multiparty, democratically elected Soviets, with the
perspective of constructing a classless society internationally.</p>

<p>But the followers of the SWP do not draw the obvious conclusion
that a separate organisation of state caps is unjustified in these
Eastern European countries. They do not see that the task of any
revolutionary there is to help advanced workers and intellectuals
battle on two fronts, against the bureaucracy and against
restorationist forces. Instead of defending the interests of the
proletariat as a whole, which above all demands the (re)creation of
class independence (no easy matter), the followers of the SWP
concentrate on stirring up an artificial distinction from every other
revolutionary current &#8211; a distinction exclusively based on
acceptance of the dogma of &#8216;state capitalism&#8217;, their sectarian
shibboleth.</p>

<p>That can only reinforce the image of revolutionary Marxists as
scholastic dogmatists, as hopeless &#8216;splitters&#8217;, which first
Stalinists and then neo-Stalinists and neo-social democrats have
systematically spread in these countries in order to discredit
revolutionary Marxists (and increasingly these days Marxism itself).
This image is counterproductive. It weakens the real possibilities
that Marxists have in these countries, not to found sects, but to
become the major pole of attraction for the militant left inside the
workers&#8217; movement as it reconstructs itself.</p>

<p>Fortunately the negative effect of this will remain limited, both
because of the theoretical, political and organisational strength
which the Fourth International has already gained (its influence is
real there in a way that the SWP&#8217;s is not), and because of the
understanding and experience that the best indigenous forces
springing up in those countries have progressively accumulated that
the role played there by the SWP clearly illustrates the negative
repercussions of sectarianism.</p>

<p>This sectarianism has made the SWP incapable of making any
progress towards the construction of an international organisation.
Sects can only link up with mini-sects which they closely control.
Organisationally, their sectarianism prevents them linking up with
substantial, autonomous revolutionary bodies in an important number
of countries. Politically, this is because they fail to understand
the real process of mass struggle in most countries in the world. The
SWP is essentially, then, a national-communist organisation, which is
forced to fob its members off by trying to create grouplets in a few countries.</p>

<p>After 40 years experience our record in this respect cannot be
faulted. The Fourth International exists for real as the one and only
world organisation. It is, of course, still small, too small, and is
far from being the mass revolutionary international for which it is
working and of which it will constitute just one element. However, it
is much stronger than in 1938 or than in 1948, both in numbers, in
rootedness in the workplace and unions, and in geographical terms. It
exists in 50 countries or so. Some of its sections and sympathising
organisations play a genuine part in the workers&#8217; movement and the
mass movement in their respective countries, which is recognised by
all. It acts and will continue to act in a non-sectarian fashion, on
the basis laid down above in the <strong>Communist Manifesto</strong>.</p>

<p>It can do so because it represents the one current in the
international workers&#8217; movement which takes on the unconditional
and uncompromising defence of the interests of the workers and the
oppressed in the three sectors of the world revolution &#8211; the
imperialist countries, the countries under bureaucratic dictatorship
and the so called Third World countries &#8211; without anywhere
subordinating this defence to any supposed &#8216;priorities&#8217;. This is
what allows the building at one and the same time of national
revolutionary organisations and of an international revolutionary
organisation. In this respect, an understanding, based on the theory
of permanent revolution, on the Trotskyist analysis of Stalinism, on
<strong>The Transitional Programme</strong> and on the &#8216;dialectic of the
three sectors of the world revolution&#8217;, of what has happened, and
is happening in the USSR, in the Third World and in the organised
workers&#8217; movement in the imperialist countries, has proved both
operational and effective.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> Bordiga, who advanced a different variant from Cliff&#8217;s about
&#8216;state capitalism&#8217; in the USSR, predicted that a general crisis
of overproduction was going to occur in that country. He even
announced the precise year in which it would break out. The year came
and has long since gone. The general crisis of overproduction in the
USSR is still awaited ...</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f2" name="n2">2.</a> The SWP comrades did not at all predict the overproduction
crises of 1974&#8211;75 and 1980&#8211;82. We did so almost to the year in
which they broke out.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f3" name="n3">3.</a> It is another matter to know what period of time is needed for
the process to have some chance of completion.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f4" name="n4">4.</a> See the perfectly clear statement by Trotsky in <a href="../../../trotsky/1932/10/sovecon.htm" target="new"><strong>The Soviet
Economy in Danger</strong></a> (1932).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f5" name="n5">5.</a> It would be better to add, the triple or quadruple pricing
system, for account must be taken of black market prices and of the
&#8216;prices&#8217; (comparative advantages) of the &#8216;grey market&#8217;
(exchange of services).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f6" name="n6">6.</a> In addition the growing importance of the mass liberation
movements in the colonial and semi-colonial countries from 1925&#8211;28
onwards should be included.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f7" name="n7">7.</a> Written in 1960, <strong>Marxist Economic Theory</strong> (first edition,
Merlin Press), p.&nbsp;598: &#8216;At the same time the rates of
industrial expansion had to be reduced&#8217;, <strong>ibid.</strong> (second
edition, 1969).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f8" name="n8">8.</a> Aganbegyan claims that there was one year of absolute decline
in production under Brezhnev. This is contradicted by every other source.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f9" name="n9">9.</a> Complete and permanent monopolies are impossible under
capitalism. The very divergence between their rates of profit and
those in other branches inevitably attracts capital towards the
sector that has been monopolised.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f10" name="n10">10.</a> The Lambertists believe this.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f11" name="n11">11.</a> We devoted one entire chapter in <strong>Late Capitalism</strong> to
developing this idea.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f12" name="n12">12.</a> This is the &#8216;rational kernel&#8217; of Keynesian and
neo-Keynesian theories, which in every other respect are wrong.</p>
