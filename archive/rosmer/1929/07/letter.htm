<p class="fst">Dear Comrade Cannon:</p>

<p class="fst">We have decided here to publish an International Review, called <strong>Opposition</strong> as soon as possible. We hope to be ready by next September. This review is to be published in two languages: French and German. An English edition is, of course, very desirable, but we believe it not possible for the present ... In the meantime, we shall send you, of course, all articles of an international interest for insertion in <strong>The Militant</strong> ...</p>

<p>We hope that the French Opposition will take during the months to come a new development. We are preparing a weekly which, according to our intention, must unite the present small groups &#8211; or most of the comrades who are in them &#8211; and above all many Communists who are no more members of the Party but are quite demoralized by Stalin&#8217;s zigzags and partially inactive, our task will be hard but we take it with great confidence.</p>

<p>The arrival every fortnight of <strong>The Militant</strong> is always a great joy to me. I read it at once from beginning to end: it is good stuff and I admire your fighting spirit in the struggle against the Stalinist clique.</p>

<p class="c">With my best wishes for the young Communist League,</p>

<p class="fst">P.S. &#8211; You know perhaps that Foster is an old acquaintance of mine. I wonder how he can stay in Stalin&#8217;s galley. I used to hear him speak rather harshly of &#8220;bolshevisation.&#8221;</p>
