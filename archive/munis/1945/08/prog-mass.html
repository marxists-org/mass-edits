<h1>Relationship of Program to Mass Influence</h1>

<h4 class="western">An Answer to Enrique Procuna</h4>

<h3 class="western">(August 1945)</h3>

<hr class="infotop" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="info">From <strong>The New International</strong>, <a href="../../../../history/etol/newspape/ni/issue2.htm#ni46_04" target="new">Vol.&nbsp;XII No.&nbsp;4</a>, April 1945, pp.&nbsp;105&#8211;107.<br />

<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">In the previous issue of <strong>Revolution</strong>, Comrade Enrique
Procuna presented a polemical article called <a href="../../../../history/etol/newspape/ni/vol12/no04/procuna.html" target="new"><em>The Fourth International and Working-Class Unity: Workers&#8217; Democracy and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat</em></a>. Observing the large numbers of
militants who have abandoned the Third International since the first
symptoms of its political degeneration became manifest, Comrade
Procuna asks why the Fourth International has not been able to grow
on a large scale. Comrade Procuna puts a period to his question with
the observation that one cannot explain these facts as one explains
the degeneration of the Russian Revolution, by the unfavorable
conditions encountered by the European revolution since 1923. &#8220;What
immediately leaps to view,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is the fact that after the
experiences of the Russian and German Revolutions, and much later,
the Spanish Revolution, nothing serious can be achieved without a
correct analysis of these historic events.&#8221; He thereby implies that
the absence of this correct analysis has been, and is, an obstacle to
the vigorous development of the Fourth International. And by
light-mindedly linking the Trotskyist movement with centrism, he
attributes to the former the lack of a concrete and profound analysis
of events so characteristic of the latter. With this mistaken method,
he only succeeds in imitating centrism; that is, Procuna substitutes
vague generalities for concrete analysis. I reproach him all the more
strongly for this, since Procuna knows that if in the ranks of the
Fourth International concep- [some text missing in printed version]
exist centrist deviations coupled with organizational conceptions
intractable to criticism, they are not generally characteristic of
the Fourth International, but apply principally to our American
section, which we have been the first to criticize with the utmost vigor.</p>

<p>Of course, the downward trend of the European revolutionary
movement is not sufficient to explain the limited growth of
international Trotskyism. And the decline of the revolutionary
movement did not follow a straight line, but occurred in zig-zag
fashion. The process was not fatalistically predetermined, but was
subject to the intervention of human consciousness; in so far, it
must be added, as this consciousness was susceptible to the pressure
of the Trotskyist movement. Our ideas were not the only force acting
on the historical process. We had to content against the negative
power of the Social-Democracy and, above all, Stalinism. The latter,
usurping the prestige of the Russian Revolution, which still dazzles
the masses as the greatest exploit since the Paris Commune, was able
to yield a great power of deception. This power of deception can be
explained by the general law, &#8220;Being determines consciousness.&#8221;
The masses, including the majority of militants with some training,
refused to believe that the Russian Revolution had been betrayed, and
that the Third International, officially linked to it, represented
the counter-revolution, and not the Russian Revolution. To grasp this
reality, the living experience was necessary. It was given, and given
painfully, by the triumph of Nazism in Germany, and its domination
over Europe; by the barbarous Stalinist despotism in Russia; by the
wanton destruction of the imperialist war, and by the new slavery
imposed on Europe and the world in general by the
Washington-London-Moscow combination.</p>

<p>Taking the Spanish experience primarily into account, I believe
that before the war the Trotskyist movement had some possibility of
developing and of turning upward once more the descending line of the
world revolution. But these .possibilities were meager indeed,
compared to the crushing number that led in the opposite direction.
The reason why it could not take advantage of the opportunities which
did present themselves is to be found in the inadequacies and defects
common to any organization in the period of formation: extreme
numerical weakness, meager material resources, inability to approach
the masses, vacillation in critical situations, and many other
imponderable factors. No serious militant can reproach the Trotskyist
movement for not knowing how to build, in a few years and under the
most disadvantageous conditions recorded by history, mature
revolutionary organizations nothing short of perfect. Honestly posed,
the problem reduces itself to understanding whether the organization,
holding to a correct revolutionary line, is overcoming its defects as
it develops or whether its growth is being hampered by incorrect
political ideas. Obviously, the Fourth international falls into the
first category. Even Comrade Procuna is compelled to admit that at no
point in its career has the Fourth International been guilty of any
theoretical misconceptions. But this is precisely why Procuna must
reject what is surely the main &#8211; if not the only &#8211; reason for the
limited success of the Fourth International in the pre-war period:
the unfavorable conditions since 1923. Given the fact that these
conditions have changed, and given the considerable experience
already accumulated, we have the right to expect of the leading
sections of the Fourth International a rate of growth which formerly
required tremendous enterprise.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Connection Between Program and Growth</h4>

<p class="fst">Like many other worthy militants, Comrade Procuna is guilty of a
mechanical approach. Taking as his point of departure the admitted
fact that economic conditions are ripe for the development of the
socialist revolution, he is driven to the inevitable, though tacit,
conclusion that a correct political program ought to be crowned with
success. Conversely, failure to grow is but the direct reflection of
a false political line. The social processes would proceed smoothly
indeed if they were regulated by such a simple and automatic
determinism. To refute this mechanical conception and to indicate the
complex relation between revolutionary politics and success, it is
enough to record the frequency with which the reformist and Stalinist
parties have achieved great successes while pursuing false programs
to a reactionary and criminal degree. The experience of the last ten
years permits us to accept as axiomatic the idea that it is much
easier to build big parties with an opportunistic political line than
with a line that is revolutionary. The reason is obvious. Capitalist
society presents no real resistance to the politics of the
opportunist working-class parties. And so long as it lasts, these
parties benefit from the inertia and lack of consciousness which
existing conditions impose upon the masses. In critical moments such
as those through which Europe is now passing, capitalism could not
save itself without the aid of the opportunist working-class parties.
So it is that within the framework of capitalist society these
parties are granted the right to flourish on a grand scale. For the
revolutionary party it is otherwise. It encounters the iron ring of
capitalist resistance; it must educate itself ideologically in a
hostile world; it must reach a degree of practical efficiency and a
numerical size that will permit it to undertake independent action;
above all, it must dissipate the inertia and apathy imposed by both
the capitalists and the opportunist working-class organizations on
the proletariat. The proletariat is not wailing for a correct and
finished program to fall from the skies, which it will then proceed
to adopt and carry out in action. If it had the intellectual
sensitivity and knowledge necessary to discriminate between
revolutionary and opportunist politics there would be no need for the
revolutionary party that gives the proletariat leadership in
fulfilling its historic task. And to tell the truth, the proletarian
vanguard is itself often enough found wanting in this very quality. A
revolutionary party develops itself, first of all, in the struggle
against the prejudices and bourgeois ideas that weigh down upon the
majority of the exploited masses. The relation between correct
program and success is not automatic; it is subject and subordinate
to various factors, three of which can frequently be decisive even
with the most correct program: a vanguard large enough to be in
contact with the most active and conscious layers of the proletariat,
the capabilities of the party in question, and conditions among the
masses which facilitate its break with the opportunist organizations.
Two parties who have accepted the same program are not equally
capable. As for the working class, conditions do not always permit it
to understand that the men and organizations in whom it has
confidence are betraying it. So, before the war, the masses and many
relatively advanced militants interpreted the opportunism and
betrayals of the Stalinists as tricks or maneuvers, directed, in the
last analysis, against the bourgeoisie. So great was the hope that
the Russian government would remain faithful to the great revolution.
Now, however, things begin to change. They change because the
arguments employed by the Stalinists no longer have the apparent
validity they had before; because Stalin himself is assassinating the
revolution in the countries he occupies; because the Stalinist
parties in Western Europe are serving as more powerful props for a
severely shaken capitalist system than the reformists; and, above
all, because we are entering a period of ascending development for
the revolution.</p>

<p>The only concrete criticism which Procuna makes of the Fourth
International is of not having conducted a &#8220;thorough discussion on
the important problem of the dictatorship of the proletariat and
workers&#8217; democracy,&#8221; for &#8220;fear of submitting to a severe
analysis the Russian Revolution up until Lenin&#8217;s death and,
consequently, the theories of Trotskyism, and the program of the
Fourth International.&#8221; But even if we were to accept his assertions
as correct, it would be absurd to find here the cause of the limited
development of the Fourth International in the pre-war period. The
truth is that our analysis of Soviet degeneration seemed at that time
false or exaggerated to the most capable and advanced militants of
other tendencies.</p>

<p>I cannot judge Comrade Procuna&#8217;s criticism of the Fourth
International&#8217;s program since has had not made any. He has been
content to make some superficial observations. However, he cannot
deny that the only analysis of the Russian Revolution and
counter-revolution in existence is that made by the Trotskyist
movement. So much so, that from it emanates anything concrete that
Procuna has been able to say on the subject. There exists, moreover,
the theory of bureaucratic collectivism which departs from Marxism,
destroying its conception of social evolution, and is more in the way
of a declara[tion] than than an analysis. Whether or not my opponent
leans toward this theory cannot be deduced from his article. At any
rate, nothing more remains of his accusation than the supposed fear
of critically evaluating the Russian Revolution up until the time of
Lenin&#8217;s death. Procuna does not have the right to make this
accusation until he demonstrates that some ideas pertinent to this
subject have been rejected. My reply, and I find it sufficient, is
that I consider the discussion necessary, not because I think the
analysis of the Fourth International false, but because it can be
amplified and more directly applied in the struggle of future
revolutions against the danger of Thermidor.</p>

<p>The totality of objective causes and the majority of subjective
causes to which Procuna attributes the degeneration of the Russian
Revolution and the defeat of the European Revolution in the preceding
period are but a repetition of the analysis made by the Trotskyist
movement. The ideas vaguely expressed in his article can be
summarized in the following fashion: Starting in the summer of 1918,
there begins in the Red Army and the factories a centralization of
power which gradually withdraws control of the economy and army from
the proletariat, virtually suppresses Soviet democracy and culminates
in the total suppression of all opposition. This is the source of the
Stalinist counter-revolution. While I cannot pause to refute every
argument of Comrade Procuna, I must say to him that he commits an
error in presuming that the Fourth International hypocritically seeks
to maintain its prestige by repudiating its heritage, and for that
reason singles out 1923 as the year One of degeneration.</p>

<p>In reality, the danger of Thermidor continually preoccupied the
Bolshevik Party from the moment it took power. Unfortunately, most of
what was said on this subject by Lenin, Trotsky and other leaders,
has not survived in writing, or is hermetically sealed in the
archives of the Kremlin. 1923 is simply a year of culmination, a year
in which Lenin&#8217;s disappearance from active political life
precipitates the rapid progress of Thermidor. The previous existence
of its germs in the organism of the state, the Soviets, and the Party
is attested to by the following extract from Lenin&#8217;s speech before
the Congress of the Council of Economy in 1918: &#8220;There exists a
tendency of the petty-bourgeoisie to transform the members of the
Soviets into parliamentarians, or rather, into bureaucrats. It is
necessary to struggle against this by engagingall the members of the
Soviets in an active participation in the administration. In some
parts of the country, the Soviets are being transformed into organs
which differ in no way from the Commissariats.&#8221; The Thermidorean
symptoms did escape the eyes of the best revolutionists. Their
efforts to avoid it were defeated, according to Lenin, because there
are epochs, &#8220;in which the abundant ruins of the old ideas
accumulate more rapidly than the scattered sproutings of new creations ...&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Danger of Future Thermidors</h4>

<p class="fst">Yet we must not attribute to the Thermidorean counteroffensive,
founded on the economic and social ruins of the old society, and
omnipotence which it does not possess. The experience of the Russian
Thermidor ought to be carefully studied and employed against the
future Thermidor, which will not fail to threaten. The question
Comrade Procuna poses is the great question of the revolutionary
movement: how to avoid Thermidor. One can truthfully say that the
conquest of power will seem like child&#8217;s play;·it will be far more
difficult to prevent the masses from being misled, once more, by a
reactionary clique that springs from the ranks of the revolutionary
cadre itself, and to uninterruptedly carry forward the work of
dissolving the classes, political parties and the state.</p>

<p>It is impossible to deal adequately with this important question
in a brief article. I intend to devote a special work to this
question in the near future. But those who assert that the single
ruling party is the goal of Bolshevism can put their minds at ease.
The aim of the Fourth International is the democracy of the producers
through their organs of power, with complete freedom for
working-class parties loyal to the revolutionary regime. The best of
parties, turned monolithic, tends necessarily to smother all
opposition in its own ranks, and to liberate the tendencies toward
degeneration. Nevertheless. the danger of Thermidor cannot be avoided
by the simple expedient of giving liberty to all the parties within
the revolutionary organs of power, because, among other reasons, two
or more parties can degenerate just as well as one, and can unite
their respective Thermidorean elements against the revolution. The
concrete process of Thermidor embraces a multitude of factors, large
and small, not easy to describe. One ought to remember that important
as the economic basis is, which the victorious revolution inherits
and develops, no less important is the cultural level and
intelligence of the common man. Between the one and the other, there
is no direct relation. The connection must be made by the revolution.
It must be understood that Socialism cannot be attained on the
present cultural basis. A great spirit of responsibility is necessary
&#8211; without which the indispensable discipline is realized through
coercion &#8211; and also necessary are ability, the power to make
critical decisions, vast practical knowledge, and a general level of
intelligence which will make difficult the use of deceit and fraud,
weapons used against the masses for forty centuries, and which
Thermidor turns to superlative use.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I believe that the problem of the degeneration of
the Russian Revolution and the struggle against future Thermidors
must be posed against the background of the social contradictions
which determine the function of the state, and consequently, of the
political parties and working-class organizations in general,
including the unions. Only by overcoming these contradictions, so
deeply rooted in society, will the social revolution achieve an
uninterrupted development, make an end to the government of men, and
give way to an administration of things.</p>
