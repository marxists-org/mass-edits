<p class="fst">The ruling class nowadays differs in many ways from the ruling
classes centuries ago. In those days, wars of rapine and booty could
be carried out, with all their attendant misery for the people,
without the creation of great war-myths. Armies were more or less
mercenary and the arming of the people for war was not required on
anything like the scale demanded by war today.</p>

<p>Modern war requires at least the tacit support of millions. The
powers that be would never dare to equip the masses with modern arms
without that support. But how acquire it? The masses are suspicious
enough as it is &ndash; and restless enough. They cannot very easily
be gotten to serve as cannon fodder if they are told that the war is
being fought for colonial empire or new sources of raw material or
fields of investment of surplus capital. They have to be given a more
idealistic aim: democracy, justice, freedom, defense of popular
rights, struggle against despotism, and the like. Once the masses
have been sufficiently confused and poisoned with lies, their masters
feel less uneasy about providing them with arms which, as history has
showed so often, have the ingenious faculty of shooting no matter
what direction they are, pointed in ...</p>

<p>Even Hitler, who rules at home all the weapons of totalitarian terror
finds himself obliged to drug his slaves with the propaganda that they are fighting, in the
war, for the establishment of &ldquo;socialism.&rdquo; Stalin,
arch-suppressor of revolution, finds it wise to tell the masses that
they are fighting for the &ldquo;liberation of the peoples.&rdquo; In
the &ldquo;democracies,&rdquo; war is being fought, of course, for
the &ldquo;preservation&rdquo; of democracy and the &ldquo;independence&rdquo;
of the small nations.</p>

<p>Right now, the war-mongers are having a poison-picnic with
Finland. People are literally starving to death amid unprecedented
wealth &ndash; in Cleveland and not only in Cleveland. That&rsquo;s a
bit of a scandal, you see, and it has to be covered up, especially in
face of the fact that the rulers of the United States, who haven&rsquo;t
any money to spare for the prevention of starvation, have hundreds
upon hundreds of millions of dollars for the building up of the
biggest war machine this country has ever known. Placed starkly side
by side, that wouldn&rsquo;t look so good. The hue and cry over
Finland helps to cover up both.</p>

<p>Starving or well-fed &ndash; what does it matter? cry the
champagne-and-caviar-stuffed bankers and industrial magnates. The
important thing is to prepare to defend ourselves, our women and
children and our modest little homes in Newport and on Park Avenue.
Look at poor little Finland! How democratic! How brave!</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<h4>A Few Words on Poland</h4>

<p class="fst">These remarks about the war-mongers and poor little Finland remind
us about the chauvinistic campaign of the war-mongers about poor
little Poland, only a few months ago. How they wailed and gnashed
their teeth at seeing that tender little flower of democracy nipped
in the bud! Now that the invasion of Poland is over, and they feel
they have squeezed all they can out of it for their, war-mongering
purposes, they are allowing a slim sliver of the truth about this
&ldquo;democracy&rdquo; to pierce through the columns of their press.</p>

<p><B>N.Y. World-Telegram</B> of December 22, 1939, commenting on an
article on Poland by Max Nomad, who is one of the best-informed men
in this country on the history and conditions of that country. Says
Barnes who, be it noted, is himself a bourgeois democrat:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The war in the name of civilization was undertaken
in defense of the Polish government, which had an unsavory record, so
far as democracy, social justice and minority rights are concerned.
The Polish state gave evidence of the defects and vices of Germany
and Russia without whatever virtues these larger totalitarian states
may posses in the way of efficiency ...</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;Democracy and party government were stifled (by
the &ldquo;Colonels&rdquo;. &ndash; <I>MS</I>). The able military
leadership of the pre-1918 days were excluded from the army and
amateurs substituted. Marshal Smigly-Rydz, commander in chief of the
army last autumn, was, like Hitler, a painter before he was elevated
to a high military post. Anti-Semitism was revived and the Jewish
population, much larger than that of Germany, was treated brutally.&rdquo;
(Which didn&rsquo;t prevent the Jewish bourgeois and &ldquo;socialist&rdquo;
press here from becoming wild-eyed Polish patriots during the
invasion!)</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;Worst of all was the increasing economic
desperation of the worthy Polish masses. Many peasants could not even
afford salt. They learned to split a single match into four usable
parts. They literally had to replace worn-out steel axes by those
fashioned out of stone &ndash; like the men of the cave period ...</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;When their neighbor, Czechoslovakia, was butchered
in 1938, the Polish leaders stood by, eager to snatch their slice of
the booty.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>He Can Talk How</h4>

<p class="fst">It is of course a little safer for Mr. Barnes to speak of Poland
in this way toward the end of December than at the beginning of
September. Then the war-mongering wave in this country over the
question of poor little Poland was at its height, and truth was at a
premium. The warmongers were able to increase considerably the
poison-content in the mind of the masses.</p>

<p>They are doing the same now about Mannerheim&rsquo;s Finland. The
revolutionary Marxists, who were not Hitlerites when they denounced
the war-mongers&rsquo; fraud about &ldquo;poor little Poland&rdquo;
and &ldquo;poor little (imperialist!) Czechoslovakia&rdquo; before
it, and are not Stalinists when we denounce the similar fraud about
&ldquo;poor little Finland&rdquo; today, are not only the only ones
who must tell the truth to the people, but the only ones who can
afford to tell it. And not when it&rsquo;s &ldquo;all over&rdquo; &ndash;
but in good time.<br />
