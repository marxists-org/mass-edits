<p class="fst">The decision of the Socialist Workers Party to run a candidate in the Bronx in the coming municipal elections signifies that the workers of that community will have an opportunity to vote this fall for the only militant and consistently anti-war party in the field.</p>

<p>The war danger &#8211; literally a life and death matter &#8211; is the all-dominating issue of our time. By voting for the candidates of the Socialist Workers Party working men and working women can give the most clear-cut expression to their hatred of imperialist war and of the imperialist war mongers. Such a vote, even on a local scale, will give important food for thought to those who are prepared to plunge the population of this country into a new world disaster.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>ALP Benefits</h4>

<p class="fst">Voting for the councilmanic candidates of the Socialist Workers Party will in no way invalidate votes that are cast at the same time for the candidates of the American Labor Party. The proportional representation system that exists in New York makes it possible for the first choice votes, which we hope will go to the candidates of the Socialist Workers Party, to be transferred if necessary to the second choice votes, which most workers will give to the American Labor Party candidate.</p>

<p>I am honored by my nomination as one of the standard bearers of the revolutionary Socialist Workers Party in the coming elections. I can only pledge myself to do all within my power to justify this honor by an energetic campaign to bring the platfprm of our party to the widest possible circle of labor in the Bronx.</p>
