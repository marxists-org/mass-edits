<p class="fst">Although the second World War has been on for more than three
months, it would be a mistake to suppose that the present division of
the two camps and their supporters is so fixed that the line will not
be crossed in either direction for the duration of the fighting.
Quite the contrary. One of the reasons why large-scale hostilities
have been so slow in developing between the two camps is that each of
them is rather reluctant to engage the other decisively before having
exhausted all possibilities of further alignment and realignment.
Both sides are making desperate attempts to cajole or coerce into
alliance those countries which have not yet definitely committed
their sympathies and those which have committed them but not very
firmly.</p>

<p>More plainly, at no time in modern history has the dirty
diplomatic game of duplicity, of double and triple cross, been played
so feverishly as today. At no time has trust of the peoples been so
cynically abused, their ideals and aspirations so cunningly
subverted, their lives so cold-bloodedly used as pawns, as at the
present.</p>

<p>Take the single case of Stalin&rsquo;s invasion of Finland.</p>

<p>The Italian fascists, for example, worked up a veritable passion
over the war, organized semi-official pro-Finnish demonstrations, and
even sent or promised to send a few airplanes to the Finns. Why?
Because of their devotion to the sacred cause of national
independence and the sovereign integrity of small nations? The sad
ghosts of Ethiopia and Albania would laugh out of court anyone stupid
or cynical enough to ascribe such lofty motives to Mussolini.</p>

<p>Despite his uneasy alliance with Hitler, Mussolini knows that the
Nazis and, for that matter, Stalin, have a yellow eye on the Danubian
and Balkan countries. His &ldquo;gesture&rdquo; to Finland is
Mussolini&rsquo;s way of telling Moscow and Berlin: &ldquo;Keep your
dirty pig&rsquo;s snout out of my cabbage patch&rdquo; (as Stalin
would say). &ldquo;Or else, please see to it that I get another
patch, else I may yield to the ardent advance of my Anglo-French
suitor.&rdquo; At the same time, he is saying quite unsubtly to
countries like Rumania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey: &ldquo;Resist
the Germans; resist the Russians; you will find in me a real ally and
protector. The help I merely promise to Finland will be very
substantial in your case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much the same practical objective is pursued by England and
France. To be sure, one of the aims &ndash; by no means without
importance &ndash; of the democratic demagogues is to exploit
Stalin&rsquo;s criminal invasion for the purpose of discrediting the
name of communism in the eyes of the masses, who are rightly outraged
by the latest abomination of the Kremlin gangsters. The demagogues of
course know that Stalin and his acts have as little in common with
communism, with revolutionary Marxism, as Hitler has with socialism,
but this does not prevent them from making the most out of the
situation for their own reactionary ends.</p>

<p>While England and France are just as little concerned with the
right of self-determination as Italy (see India, Indo-China, etc.!),
they are interested in blackmailing or blackjacking the Hitler-Stalin
alliance into two parts. For a series of reasons that need not be
dwelled upon here, they did not succeed in getting Hitler to play the
role of &ldquo;super-Wrangel&rdquo;, of spearhead of the imperialist
intervention into the Soviet Union &ndash; at least not at this
stage. If they could isolate Hitler and make him their tool without
the expense and risk of a world war, so much the better. Hence the
alternate wooing and threatening of Hitler&rsquo;s Moscow partner. An
example of the wooing was what was tantamount to the British
whitewash of Stalin&rsquo;s invasion of Poland, much to the
discomfiture and anger of the ludicrous remnants of the Polish
&ldquo;government&rdquo; in France. An example of the threatening is
the way England and France have &ldquo;rallied&rdquo; to Finland.
While practically nothing is excluded from possibility in these
hectic and changeful times, it is most unlikely at the present stage
that the &ldquo;democracies&rdquo; will launch a war against Stalin.</p>

<p>The British promise of material aid to Finland, like the farcical
expulsion of Russia from the League of Nations, has primarily
different aims for the moment. The countries of Southeastern Europe
are teetering uncertainly between the German and the Anglo-French
camps. The miserable, reactionary bourgeoisie of these countries is
saying to itself: If England and France do as little for us as they
did for Poland or are doing for Finland, then we might as well go
over as servants of Hitler before he crushes us completely and
dismisses us even as servants. The &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; gestures
of aid to the Finnish bourgeoisie are calculated to reassure the
Balkan vassals of London and Paris, to encourage greater resistance
to Hitler&rsquo;s encroachments.</p>

<p>At the same time, Stalin is being warned: Don&rsquo;t go much
further; don&rsquo;t tighten your alliance with Hitler. We are still
capable of making it hot for you, if not today then tomorrow, unless
you break with Berlin and join us, as we proposed last August.</p>

<p>The warning is not entirely purposeless. But Stalin will part with
Hitler only when Hitler has ceased to be a menace to him. And Hitler
will cease to be a menace only if the &ldquo;democracies&rdquo;
reduce his military capacities by a series of successful battles.</p>

<p>Like Chamberlain, Roosevelt is not only warning Stalin to break
with Hitler, but at least as important as that, he is warning him not
to make an alliance with Japan for the subjugation of China, which
would temporarily protect Stalin&rsquo;s eastern flank and turn over
most of China to the Japanese &ndash; to the exclusion of American
imperialism. At the same time, Ambassador Drew tells Tokyo that
Washington will not tolerate an alliance with Moscow at the expense
of &ldquo;China&rdquo; (read: of U.S. imperialist interests in
China).</p>

<p>As always in such cases, Finland is a mere pawn of all the
imperialist bandits, and its cause a pious fraud on their lips. Not
only its socialist interests but its democratic right to independence
are defended in reality only by us revolutionary internationalists.</p>
