<h1>The Hue and Cry About<br />
&lsquo;Poor Little Finland&rsquo;</h1>

<h3>(16 December 1939)</h3>

<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>, <a href="../../../../history/etol/newspape/themilitant/socialist-appeal-1939/index.htm#sa03_93" target="new">Vol. III No. 93</a>, 16 December 1939, p.&nbsp;3.<br />

<br />
<p class="fst">Almost everybody is joining the pack in a hue and cry over Poor
Little Finland. Mr. Hoover is collecting funds; President Roosevelt
is granting a moratorium on the Finnish debt; Congressmen are yelping
for a breaking off of relations with Russia; Alexander Kerensky is
stoutly for the independence of Finland; the Finnish White Guards in
this country are loading recruits for Finland on to ships; and the
liberals and social democrats are pouring out a sea of tears on which
to float the ships. The rearguard is brought up smartly by Norman
Thomas and the editor of his official organ, who are ready to fight
it out for Finland to the death.</p>

<p>Without exception, all the &ldquo;friends of Finland&rdquo; are
serving one objective; the whipping up of a chauvinistic war spirit
for the &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; imperialists and for American
participation in the world slaughter on their side.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Kerensky Somewhat Belated</h4>

<p class="fst">As we recall it, Mr. Kerensky, head of the Russian Provisional
Government some twenty-two years ago, was then not quite so strenuous
in his demand for the independence of Finland from Muscovite rule. In
fact, he fought both the Bolsheviks and the Finnish nationalists who
demanded the right of self-determination for Finland. We further
recall that it was the Bolsheviks under Lenin and Trotsky who, as
soon as they were in power, promptly granted Finland its
independence. Mr. Kerensky&rsquo;s love for Finland is a little &ndash;
how shall we say? &ndash; belated.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Where Were Roosevelt &amp; Co. Then?</h4>

<p class="fst">We do not recall any very vigorous activity on the part of Messrs.
Hoover, Roosevelt and Co. in behalf of Albania, Ethiopia,
Czechoslovakia, Austria, Spain and other victims of reactionary
assault.</p>

<p>When the imperialist gangsters were cutting up the world map to
suit themselves, and without bothering to inquire of the wishes of
those they were carving into greater empires, we heard barely a
whisper from all the Congressmen, statesmen and other illustrious
citizens of our Great Democracy. They did not then demand the
breaking off of diplomatic relations with Italy or Germany. And for
good reasons. Mussolini and Hitler were, after all, only doing what
every imperialist nation, the United States included, has done
throughout its existence, and continues to do.</p>

<p>But didn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; and &ldquo;socialists&rdquo;
of the <B>New Leader</B> and the <B>Nation</B> and the <B>Socialist
Call</B> protest then? Yes, they protested when the fascist bandits
carried out their abominations. But not even from them was there a
word of protest against the similar abominations of the &ldquo;democratic&rdquo;
bandits.</p>

<p>Not a murmur, for example, when France so graciously ceded to
Turkey the Syrian province of Alexandretta a short time ago, purely
for the purpose of winning Turkey to an alliance with Anglo-French
imperialism. The people of Alexandretta, non-Turkish in their
majority, were of course not consulted by either the Turks or the
French, any more than the Syrians as a whole were ever consulted
about being put under the heel of the French army and the French
banks.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>First Things First</h4>

<p class="fst">The protestations of our great American patriots and war-mongers,
from Hoover through Roosevelt to Gerry Allard would sound a spot more
convincing if they prefaced their activity by a declaration that
their first and main fight is against the violation of national
independence and sovereignty which is perpetuated by their own ruling
class, that is to say, by American imperialism in Puerto Rico, Samoa,
the Philippine Islands and elsewhere.</p>

<p>And once they made such a declaration, it would be obligatory for
them to add a similar statement with reference to their allies, that
is, to those on whose side they are asking us to fight, England and
France. They would have to say, it seems to us, that before they
presume to say a word in protest against the violation of Finland&rsquo;s
independence by Stalin, they denounce the continuing violation of the
independence of India, Indo-China, Syria, Algiers, most of Africa and
all the other colonies, protectorates and &ldquo;spheres of
influence&rdquo; of British and French imperialism.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that they will do nothing of the kind. They
are too busy working up the campaign for American participation in
the war to bother with such trifles. How does the fate of a few
hundred million Indians compare with so noble and idealistic a goal
as making the world safe for democracy a second time?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all very clear and simple. You can commit any crime in
the calendar of Stalin or Hitler or Mussolini on one condition: just
call yourself a democrat. It will not only sanctify whatever you do,
but constitute an unlimited license to condemn your opponent in world
politics for doing exactly the same thing.</p>
