<p class="fst">During the war, industry and agriculture performed miracles. We reached levels never before reached in the United States. We outproduced the rest of the world.</p>

<p><em>These miracles were performed in the service of war. Never before was such a thorough job done of destroying life and property.</em></p>

<p>Now the job is to maintain life, not to destroy it. More than a year has passed since the end of the war. But that job seems further from success than ever.</p>

<p>We are faced with an unbelievable spectacle:</p>

<p><em>A country which spent billions to erect buildings for war production cannot provide decent housing for millions who badly need it, including millions of war veterans.</em></p>

<p>With a record figure of livestock in the country, it is impossible to buy a pound of meat without paying fantastic black market prices for it.</p>

<p><em>The industrialists and bankers say:</em></p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;No more controls, no more ceilings. If we don&rsquo;t have the right to unlimited, monopolistic profits, the people can go on living in holes and without decent food.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">The Republicans respond to this shameless blackmailing and blackjacking of the whole country by saying: &ldquo;Remove all controls. Do what the monopolists say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Democrats in office answer:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;No, let us have controls which controlled nothing yesterday, control nothing today and will control nothing tomorrow.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;Every week we will raise ceilings until the monopolists get what they want.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Meanwhile, there is no meat, no housing, no consumer goods in general, and no relief in sight.</em></p>

<p>The Congressional election gives you an opportunity to answer these self-confessed bankrupts who cannot even feed or house the people of the richest land in the world..</p>

<p>In presenting me as its candidate for the 15th Congressional District of Brooklyn, and for the Congressman from Harlem, the noted Negro labor leader, Ernest Rice McKinney, the Workers Party, a socialist political organization, has put the food and price question right at the top of its election platform.</p>

<p><em>As candidate of that party, 1 call for the immediate nationalization of all food industries under workers&rsquo; control.</em></p>

<p>I call for a 12&frac12; billion dollar national appropriation for housing and other public works, which is very little compared with two billion dollars spent for the atom bomb.</p>

<p>We can have fair distribution of food at low prices only by ending the farce of OPA and nationalizing the basic industries.</p>

<p><em>Take them out of the hands of the bankrupts and blackmailers. Put them under the control &ndash; not of a few thousand helpless bureaucrats &ndash; but of the 15 million workers democratically organized in the trade unions and price committees of housewives and consumers.</em></p>

<p>They are not interested in blood profits but in feeding and housing the people decently.</p>

<p>They are in a position to keep a close check on production and distribution all the way down the line, from raw materials to the retail outlet &ndash;</p>

<p>To control profits and prices democratically and without an army of bureaucrats.</p>

<p><em>You can&rsquo;t know the truth about shortages, secret deals between manufacturers and black marketeers, profits and prices &ndash; unless you control production and distribution.</em></p>

<p>And there is no more effective agency for such control than the workers, housewives and consumers of the country.</p>

<p><em>That is the main point you are supporting when you cast your vote for Max Shachtman in Brooklyn or Ernest R. McKinney in Harlem this November.</em></p>

<p>If you are interested in our platform, write the Workers Party, 114 West 14th Street, in New York City.</p>
