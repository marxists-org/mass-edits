However, in order that the hearing may be most useful and fruitful on both sides, it seems to me necessary that your office indicate to us the grounds on which it was decided to include the Workers Party in your list of subversive organizations, that is, just what charges have been levelled at us and what evidence has been adduced to sustain them. With this information at our disposal, the matter will be enormously simplified both for your office and for ourselves. Our representative at the conference with you will thereby be relieved of the handicap of refuting charges or evidence of which we are now unaware. With the material in our hands in advance, on the contrary, the time of our conference can be efficiently devoted to a point by point consideration of every charge against our party and of all evidence that may be produced by your office.</P><P>I am sure that you will agree with the wisdom and fairness of the procedure I propose. Once this information is provided us, it will be only a matter of a few days for us to prepare our own documentary material, to call upon any corroborating witnesses we may find necessary, and thereupon set a satisfactory date for the hearing in Washington.</P><P>It may be that the appointment you propose with a representative of our party has as its purpose a preliminary conference between us at which the actual procedure to be followed at a subsequent formal hearing is to be discussed. In that case, I am prepared to come to your office without further delay and without being provided with the material that I request above. It would then be possible for us to discuss at this conference all the necessary arrangements for a formal hearing on our application for the removal of the name of the Workers Party from the &ldquo;subversive list&rdquo; and to take up also the matter of the charges and evidence against us.</P><P>I await your early reply with the greatest interest.</P><TABLE WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=3>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH=60%>			<P>&nbsp;</P>		</TD>		<TD>			<p class="fst">Your truly,<BR><I>Max Shachtman</I>,<BR>National Chairman,			Workers Party</P>		</TD>	</TR></TABLE><p class="fst">MS:B</P><p class="link">&#160;<br /><a href="#top">Top of the page</a></p><table border="2" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="2" align="center"><tr><td valign="middle" align="center" width="50%"><a href="../../index.htm"><img src="../../shach-z.gif" alt="button" border="0" /></a><br /><small><small><a href="../../index.htm">Max Shachtman<br />Archive</a></small></small></td><td valign="middle" align="center"><a href="../../../index.htm"><img src="../../../../glossary/people/m/pics/marx.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="button" border="0" /></a><br /><small><small><a href="../../../index.htm">Marxist Writers&#8217;<br />Archives</a></small></small></td></tr></table><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" /><p class="updat">Last updated on 22 May 2018</p></body></html>
