<p class="fst">In 1940 an internal struggle in the Socialist Workers Party
resulted in a split, the Minority forming the Workers Party as an
independent organization. The split has continued up to the present
time. Attempts made in recent times to find a basis for the
unification of the two parties satisfactory to both sides, given the
existence of the recognized disagreements on a number of important
questions, did not meet with success and the discussions of the
project were discontinued.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Question of Unification Reopened</h4>

<p class="fst">In recent days the question was opened again. New discussions
between the leading committees of the two organizations have taken
place. On February 10, the National Committee of the WP presented a
written declaration in favor of unification. In this declaration the
National Committee of the WP obligated itself to accept the decisions
of an Extraordinary Party Convention projected for the coming fall.
This obligation was undertaken with the understanding that the WP,
like the SWP, would have the right to participate in the
pre-convention discussion and to be represented at the EPC with full
rights and in proportion to its numerical strength; and that fusion
of the two organizations into a united party would be achieved. On
this basis, the WP pledged itself to abide by the discipline of the
united party, politically as well as organizationally, even if the
EPC should adopt decisions which would place the members of the WP in
the position of a minority.</p>

<p>The plenum of the National Committee of the SWP, meeting in New
York, February 15&#8211;16, accepted this declaration as providing a
realistic basis for unity and unanimously voted in favor of
unification on this basis. In view of the WP declaration, the plenum
of the SWP on its part agreed that the WP should have the right to
participate in the preparatory discussion of the EPC in a special
discussion bulletin which will be distributed to the members of both
parties. This discussion is to be completed in the branches of the
separate organizations before the formal unification.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Committees Recommended Unity of Parties</h4>

<p class="fst">As to the specific forms of the proposed unification, it has been
agreed by both sides that the members of the WP and the SWP, as of
February 10, 1947, as well as all those recruited by each party
subsequent to that date shall be admitted into the ranks of the
united party as a body, without prejudice or discrimination. However,
while the unity negotiations are in progress, neither party will
admit into its ranks any individuals or groups who are now or who
have formerly been members of the other party, except by agreement.
During the same period it is agreed that no exclusive measures will
be taken by either party against any members or groups in its ranks
in disciplinary cases arising out of the discussion on unity without
consultation with the other party.</p>

<p>On the basis of the agreements and conditions outlined above, the
two National Committees are recommending the unification of the two
parties. If this recommendation is approved by the members of the two
parties, as preliminary consultation indicates is most probable, the
formal unification will take place as soon as the discussion now
proceeding in the ranks of the two organizations is concluded. In the
meantime, a joint committee of the two organizations has been
established, which is empowered to organize and arrange a program of
cooperation and joint activities of the two parties in all possible
fields of the class struggle, designed to lead up to and prepare the
way for the informal unification.</p>
