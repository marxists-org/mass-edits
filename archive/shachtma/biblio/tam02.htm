<h3>Notes</h3>

<p class="fst">Max Shachtman was an author, editor and communist leader. Shachtman, a Polish immigrant, became interested in socialist reform early in his life. In 1923, at the age of 19, he began working full time for the communist movement. In 1928 he was expelled from the party after adopting Trotsky&#8217;s views. In 1929 he became a leader of the Communist League of America, the new Trotskyist organization. In 1940 Shachtman again lead a splinter group away from the party over differences arising from the Hitler-Stalin Pact of 1939 and formed the Workers Party which became the Independent Socialist League in 1948. During the 1950s the Shachtmanites came to reject the Leninist concept of the party, reaffirming that democracy is essential to socialism. He continued active participation in Socialist affairs and during the 1960s began a history of the Communist International which remained unfinished at his death in 1972.</p>
