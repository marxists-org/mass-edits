<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>, <a href="../../../../history/etol/newspape/themilitant/socialist-appeal-1938/index.htm#sa02_17" target="new">Vol. II No. 17</a>, 23 April 1938, p.&#160;4.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="../../../../admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Marxists&#8217; Internet Archive</strong>.</p>

<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">I hope the readers of the <strong>Appeal</strong> will pardon me for a personal statement, but Mr. Michael Gold&#8217;s column in the <strong>Daily Worker</strong> of April 19, 1938, leaves me no other course. The day before it appeared I received a letter from the circulation department of the pictorial weekly, <strong>Life</strong>, saying that I was going to receive that periodical for a year as a gift from Michael Gold .</p>

<p>The only Michael Gold I know of is the aforementioned columnist, and my reaction to this felicitous token of affection from a political foe may well be imagined. All the more disconcerting was it to have Mr. Gold make public a letter from Anne Bedford, of <strong>Life</strong>, billing him for the $4.50 in payment of the subscription. With what is dismayingly like a terror-stricken tone, he adds:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;(1) I never sent in any such order for a subscription; (2) I am so chummy with Max Shachtman, Trotsky&#8217;s sneaking little stooge in this country, that the only thing I would help him to would be the reward of a Judas; and (3) I am painfully uninterested in <strong>Life</strong>, and would not subscribe to it for anyone ... So, Annie, don&#8217;t bill me for $4.50, because it will not be paid you.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Now if Michael Gold wants to back out of the subscription just on account of a measly four dollars and fifty cents, why, that&#8217;s all right with me, although everybody knows what a real sporting man thinks of a welcher. An impetuous literary man might be forgiven an act of impulse, but he hadn&#8217;t ought to get so offensive about it when the time comes for the pay-off. Personally, you see, I had no intention to do any talking about the gift, because I have myself to think of and it wouldn&#8217;t be so good to have my name coupled with even a penitent Gold. And if the latter hadn&#8217;t gone shooting off his mouth, no one would have been the wiser.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, it isn&#8217;t entirely his fault. May be the prison censor on 13th Street opened <strong>Life</strong>&#8217;s letter before passing it into Gold&#8217;s cell and he got scared that he might have to do another stretch in solitary. Yessir, that may account for Gold&#8217;s column. But even so I still think he shouldn&#8217;t have been so infernally dirty about it.</p>
