<p class="fst">On Saturday 16 August, the fiftieth anniversary of the first of the three big Moscow Trials of the old Bolsheviks, the <strong>Guardian</strong> carried a full page commemorative article by Geoffrey Robertson entitled <em>The Day of the Mad Dogs</em>.</p>

<p>It was a curious article in a number of ways but most notably in that it was largely devoted to Nikolai Bukharin. Now Bukharin was not on trial in 1936. Indeed he was still editor of <strong>Pravda</strong> at the time. What he privately thought about the trial can only be guessed. What <strong>Pravda</strong> said is a matter of record. It daily denounced the &#8216;mad dogs&#8217; in the dock, Zinoviev and Kamenev being the best known, along with their alleged leader the exiled Trotsky, as fascists, traitors, agents of Hitler, scum, human vermin etc.</p>

<p>True, Bukharin&#8217;s own turn duly came (at the third trial in 1938) but why, on the anniversary of the first monstrous frame-up in 1936, scarcely a paragraph about Zinoviev, President of the Communist International in Lenin&#8217;s day, Kamenev, Politbureau member with Lenin and his literary executor and, above all, Trotsky the real principal defendant in all three trials?</p>

<p>The political motivation is clear enough. Bukharin, we are told, &#8216;occupies an honoured place in the eyes of Communist reformers in countries outside the Soviet Union [read Eurocommunist &#8211; <em>DH</em>], his political and economic principles are increasingly in tune with those espoused by Gorbachev.&#8217;</p>

<p>In a particularly disgraceful paragraph Robertson writes: &#8216;It was incredible that Bukharin would have joined forces with his old enemies the Trotskyites, and conspired with [the] fascist powers ...&#8217; &#8211; implying that Trotsky (and presumably Zinoviev and the others) did or might have done!</p>

<p>It is not my purpose here to discuss the actual role and political ideas of Bukharin. That has been attempted in various articles in <strong>International Socialism</strong> by Peter Sedgwick, myself and (most recently) Mike Haynes.</p>

<p>I wish instead to stress two related points. First, the &#8216;evidence&#8217; against <em>all</em> the accused in all three trials was equally and utterly worthless; a mass of baseless fabrications supported only by confessions obtained by torture (as Khruschev, in effect, admitted).</p>

<p>Second, an important function of the trials was to demonstrate to the Western powers that Stalin&#8217;s regime represented a decisive break with the revolutionary politics of Lenin and his associates (the earlier Bukharin included) and was a reliable coalition partner of the British and French empires against Hitler.</p>

<p>This was the era of the Popular Front, of the abandonment by the Stalinised Communist parties of revolutionary class politics in favour of collaboration with &#8216;their own&#8217; ruling classes, of the strangling of the Spanish revolution in the name of &#8216;democracy&#8217;.</p>

<p>The trials, the terror in the USSR and the Popular Front were integral parts of the same phenomena &ndash; the consolidation of Stalin&#8217;s conservative regime in the USSR and its emergence as a &#8216;great power&#8217; pursuing the ends of its own ruling class.</p>
