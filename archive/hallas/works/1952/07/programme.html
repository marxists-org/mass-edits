<p class="fst">Since the inception of our group we have pursued a policy of
propaganda and education amongst advanced workers, many of them
already influenced by Trotskyist ideas. We have concentrated on
building a cadre rather than on influencing the class struggle. In
spite of occasional attempts at political action, that is to say,
intervention in specific struggles with concrete slogans, we have
remained in the main, a purely propaganda group. (Of course
individual comrades have been engaged in various actions &#8211; I am
concerned here with the group as a unit.) I believe that this policy
was absolutely correct in the first period of our existence. We have
succeeded by these means in stabilising our membership, getting rid
of indigestible elements, integrating new comrades, and in publishing
a paper. But we can make no significant further progress along these
lines as the experience of the last six months has demonstrated. The
conclusion to be drawn is, in my opinion, that we must enter into
serious political work with our present cadre. In order to avoid any
misunderstanding it is essential to make clear the difference between
political actions (or agitation if comrades prefer) and propaganda.
If in a local labour party we put down a motion on the textile crisis
saying, in effect, that the crisis is inevitable under capitalism,
condemning the self-defeating class collaboration policies of the
leadership and calling for a struggle against the bosses (as, for
example, is done in the excellent article by Cde. Lowndes in the last
issue of our paper) &#8211; this is propaganda action. Everything we say
is true and it is very necessary to say it as effectively as we can.
But it is not a political intervention. Supposing that instead, we
put down a motion demanding work or full maintenance at trade union
rates, mentioning in passing our general thesis <em>but concentrating
our fire on the immediate demand</em> then we are giving a concrete
answer to a concrete question, an answer which wide sections of the
workers can understand and can be induced to struggle for &#8211; in
other words a political as opposed to a propaganda answer. At the
present time our answers <em>as a group</em> are all of the propaganda
variety. The decisive proof of this is the paper. We have articles,
excellent articles, on many questions, articles which analyse and
inform, articles for the serious student, but not (with one or two
exceptions such as the articles of Cde. Carlsson) articles calling
for action in any immediate and concrete sense. To say that we must
now enter into serious political work means that we must shift our
emphasis from propaganda to agitation. To do this we need two things,
a programme and a perspective. Again to avoid misunderstanding by a
programme I do not mean a document reiterating the fundamentals of
Communism &#8211; though such a document one should certainly also have &#8211;
I mean a list of things we tell the workers <em>to do now</em>, by a
perspective I do not mean an analysis of the decline of British
capitalism &#8211; again this is a necessary weapon in our armoury &#8211; I
mean a concrete plan of work to build the group. I submit the
following as a suitable transitional programme, i.e., as a programme
of demands which can be made to appear both necessary and realizable
to broad sections of the workers <em>given their present (reformist)
level of understanding</em> but which in reality pass beyond the
framework of bourgeois democracy. Naturally, since it says only part
(a fairly small part) of what we advocate, it is only one of several
possible programmes and for that reason I would not be dogmatic in
defending the inclusion of one point and the exclusion of another.
But I would strongly maintain that it is the sort of programme for
which we ought to be actively fighting.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Programme</h4>

<p class="fst">The <strong>Socialist Review</strong> stands for the overthrow of the Tory
Government by all the means at the disposal of the working class
movement and the establishment of a Labour government pledged to
carry out radical measures in the interests of the workers, including
the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>To break the stranglehold of finance capital on the means
of livelihood of the people and progress towards socialism,
renationalise without further compensation all industries
denationalised by the present government and nationalise the Joint
Stock banks, insurance companies, the land, the chemical industry
and the twelve sections of the engineering industry specified by the
Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>To eliminate the class of social parasites whose numbers
have been swollen by the so-called compensation provision of
previous nationalisation measures and establish the socialist
principal <em>(sic)</em> that all who eat must work, introduce the
principle of cash compensation to ex-owners in cases of proved need
only, such need to be assessed by elected committees of workers, and
suspend interest payments on the national debt except on holdings of
less than &#0163;500.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>To prevent the growth of a new class of bureaucratic
&#8220;managers&#8221;, and to make &#8220;industrial democracy&#8221; more than a
phrase. The majority of all members of national, area and other
boards in nationalised industries shall consist of elected workers&#8217;
representatives who shall be subject to periodic re-election and to
recall at any time by the men and women who elected them and who
shall be paid the average skilled rate in the industry concerned. To
prevent sabotage by the capitalists in the remaining privately-owned
industries. Two or more elected workers&#8217; representatives shall sit
on the board of each concern employing more than 20 workers with
full legal rights to attend all meetings and inspect all books and
documents and to call in expert advisers from outside where
necessary. To prevent bureaucratic mismanagement and unnecessary
disputes, no change in working conditions at pit and plant level
shall be permitted in any industry without the consent of the pit or
shop organisation of the workers in whose hands shall rest
exclusively the control of hiring and firing.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>To develop the social services till they approach the
socialist principle of from each according to his ability to each
according to his need, taking the following first steps:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<ol type="a">
<li>Reinstate a completely free national health service and
abolish the anomaly of the &#8220;private&#8221; patient.</li>
<li>Establish the principle of full maintenance at trade union
rates for the unemployed.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>A sliding scale of adequate pensions based on a new and
realistic cost of living index.</li>
<li>A real housing drive assisted by the allocation of adequate
capital resources, interest free loans to local authorities, more
drastic powers to requisition and rent-free state-owned land.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<ol start="5">
<li>A foreign policy based on independence of both Moscow and
Washington, political support to the struggles of the workers and
peasants everywhere, independence to the colonies or free federation
if they desire it as an immediate right, economic aid to the
backward areas, withdrawal of all British forces from overseas, and
immediate publication and repudiation of all secret treaties and
only such rearmament as is necessary to defend a socialist Britain.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">I will not attempt to anticipate objections to this sort of
programme except on one point. It may be argued that because the
programme does not call for workers&#8217; councils, democratisation (a
euphemism for disintegration) of the state machine, etc., it is a
reformist programme. I would reply to that by pointing out that this
programme cannot possibly be carried out without a fight to the
finish with the bourgeoisie. In the course of that struggle the
situation will become clearer to the advanced workers and we can then
advance such slogans <em>which will then be seen to be necessary</em>.
To advance them now would be simply a waste of time.<em>It goes
without saying that in our propaganda we put the Marxist case</em>,
but this programme is for immediate <em>agitation</em> in the British
Labour movement and must therefore be designed to fit the
consciousness of <em>that movement</em>, not of some hypothetical one.</p>

<p>Finally our perspective. Our next steps should be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Transform the <strong>S.R.</strong> into a paper fighting for this programme
as an immediate task.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Initiate groupings in the localities based on this
programme including all who will accept it regardless of what
illusions they may have on other questions.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Invite all existing groupings and individuals to do
likewise. (I have in mind here people like the Kendall group in the
L.O.Y. and the &#8220;Rally&#8221; periphery, etc.) and attempt to unite
them on this basis into a national fraction.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Develop trade union fractions within this group on the
basis of our usual trade union demands.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>A paper for this group (ours if possible but not as a
principle).</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">I believe that with work and good direction from the centre this
is a realistic proposition and is the correct tactic for a Labour
Party fraction. We start on the basis of a programme (unlike the
&#8220;Socialist Fellowship&#8221;) which will be acceptable to many elements
whom we cannot now reach (&#8220;we are sectarian&#8221; etc.) and who will
in the course of the struggle arrive at a consistent revolutionary
position &#8211; with our assistance, naturally. This is the road to a
sizeable revolutionary fraction and ultimately to the masses.</p>
