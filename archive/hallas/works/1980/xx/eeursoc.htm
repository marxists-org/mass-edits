<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">I read the article <a href="../../../../../history/etol/writers/binns/1980/xx/newtheories.html" target="new"><em>New theories of Eastern European class societies</em></a> (<strong>IS2&#160;:&#160;7</strong>) with great interest. It was a most timely and instructive piece of work.</p>

<p>Particularly valuable was the demonstration of the politically indeterminate character of the &#8216;new form of class society&#8217; analyses. Are these societies more progressive than western capitalism (as Fantham and Machover says they are &#8220;in their initial stages&#8221;), less progressive or simply equivalent? The answer depends entirely on the current political preoccupations and impressions of the &#8216;new form of class society&#8217; theorists.</p>

<p>Thus when they had illusions in Mao&#8217;s China it, unlike the USSR was &#8216;progressive&#8217;. Now, without any real change in class structure or political superstructure, it is no longer so. In short these theories are not a guide to action. They are merely a smokescreen for the vacillations of impressionists.</p>

<p>This is not a new issue for our tendency. Long ago it was necessary for us to sharply distinguish our ideas from the various &#8216;bureaucratic collectivist&#8217; trends, in particular that associated with the American group led by Max Shachtman. An article you cite, <a href="../../../../cliff/works/1948/xx/burcoll.htm" target="new" class="mia"><em>A critique of the theory of Bureaucratic Collectivism</em></a> (<strong>IS</strong>, series 1, No.&#160;32) was actually first published in 1952.</p>

<p>In it Cliff demonstrates that Shachtman and others like him fluctuated between the views that the USSR was &#8220;on a historically more progressive plane&#8221; (in relation to western capitalism) to &#8220;Stalinism is the new barbarism&#8221;; all depending on current views amongst the radical petit-bourgeois intellectuals in America. This was an issue of great practical importance, the western CPs were also &#8216;new barbarians&#8217; during the Cold War for these people.</p>

<p>The present &#8216;State Collectivist&#8217; trends in the European Left are essentially similar. What they have in common is a lack of any serious grounding in Marxism.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Binns-Haynes article itself makes unwarranted concessions to these impressionists.</p>

<p>In particular the statement that &#8220;labour power cannot be a commodity in the USSR because with only one company (USSR Ltd.) purchasing it there cannot be a genuine labour market there. <em>With this (considered purely on its own) we have no quarrel</em>&#8221; (my emphasis &#8211; <em>DH</em>).</p>

<p>But we have and <em>must</em> have. What is at issue here is nothing less than whether there is a proletariat (in Marx&#8217;s sense) in the USSR or whether there is not.</p>

<p>To concede that there is not is to accept the substance of the &#8216;exceptionalist&#8217; case and to undermine the fundamental basis of the bureaucratic state capitalist analysis.</p>

<p>If labour power is not a commodity in the USSR, then there is no proletariat. Moreover, if labour power is not a commodity then there can be no wage labour/capital relationship and therefore no capital either. Therefore there can be no capitalism in any shape or form.</p>

<p>Because, to return to basics, capital, for Marx, is &#8220;an independent social power, i.e., as the power of part of society it maintains itself and increases by exchange for direct living labour power&#8221; (my emphasis &#8211; <em>DH</em>).</p>

<p>No exchange, no capital. Exchange requires wages and therefore <em>money</em> (the generalised commodity) and the production of commodities &#8211; goods produced for sale.</p>

<p>If it is indeed the case that there is no commodity production in the USSR, and no real money (as Ticktin <em>et al.</em> argue), then the USSR is not capitalist. It must be a new method of extracting surplus product from an exploited class which is not a proletariat.</p>

<p>It simply will not do to brush aside this argument with references to slavery in the USA before 1863 because as <em>every</em> serious student (Marxist, liberal or conservative) agrees, the USA was a bourgeois republic &#8211; the product of a bourgeois revolution (1774&#8211;83) &#8211; and that slavery was never the dominant relation of production at any time.</p>

<p>Again this is not a new issue for us. Shachtman and many others argued that the working people in the USSR were, in effect, slaves. We rejected this.</p>

<p>Of course, the matter has to be decided on <em>empirical</em> grounds. The question of whether or not a particular theoretical analysis is or is not appropriate to a given system is, as Marx himself said, an empirical matter.</p>

<p>This is why Cliff, in the article Binns and Haynes cite and elsewhere, devoted considerable space to demonstrating that Russian workers are in fact &#8216;free&#8217; in Marx&#8217;s sense (free <em>both</em> from control of the means of production and from servitude to a particular enterprise). He proved that, in spite of various legal restriction, the turnover of labour in enterprises <em>even in the period of high Stalinism</em> was greater than anywhere else in the world. And today we have the situation of big wage premiums (20 to 25%) offered to workers who will take jobs in Eastern Siberia.</p>

<p>Slave owners do not have to offer premiums. Of course, slavery, real slavery, existed in the USSR on a considerable scale from the early thirties till the early fifties but it was never the <em>dominant</em> relation of production and it is now economically insignificant.</p>

<p>I will summarise what seems to me to be irrefutable.</p>

<p>First, the majority of the actual producers in the USSR are free wage earners &#8211; proletarians.</p>

<p>Second their remuneration is in rouble notes &#8211; in money, real money which is a genuine means of exchange.</p>

<p>Third, they spend this money on commodities, on goods produced for sale and <em>not</em> administratively allocated as rations, &#8216;army issue&#8217; or otherwise.</p>

<p>Fourth, that therefore wage labour and commodity production exist on a large scale in the USSR.</p>

<p>Fifth, that the wage labour/capital relation is the <em>dominant</em> relation of production in the USSR and <em>that</em>, irrespective of causation, constitutes the essential capitalist feature of the regime.</p>

<p>Sixth, that to slur over these facts, or to make concessions to the &#8216;new form of class society&#8217; impressionists is not only to risk sinking to the level of a Ticktin but, more important, is to lose one&#8217;s way politically.</p>
