<em>Pluto Press, 30p</em></p>

<p class="fst"><strong>Strikes: A Documentary History</strong><br />
by R. &amp; E. Frow and Michael Katanka<br />
<em>Charles Knight, &#163;1.25</em></p>

<p class="fst">Richard Hyman has compressed into fifty odd pages a valuable discussion of some of the basic problems of revolutionary work in the unions. Do industrial struggles lead, as Marx argued, to &#8216;the ever expanding union of the workers&#8217;, to the &#8216;organisation of the proletarians as a class&#8217;? Or was Lenin correct to argue, as he did in 1902, that &#8216;the spontaneous development of the working class movement leads to its subordination to bourgeois ideology ... trade unionism means the ideological enslavement of the workers by the bourgeoisie&#8217;? Or are neither of these positions generally true?</p>

<p>Hyman explains, and illustrates by means of well chosen quotations, the views of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Michels, Trotsky and Gramsci on this and related questions. There is a good discussion of the bureaucratisation of unions under capitalism and of the possibilities of resisting it. Trotsky&#8217;s well known view that under conditions of late capitalism the major features of trade unions &#8216;is their drawing closely to and growing together with the state power&#8217; is carefully examined in the light of subsequent experience.</p>

<p>Add to this a forceful criticism of the writings of the academic &#8216;lieutenants of the capitalist class&#8217; and a cogent assessment of the current industrial situation in Britain and you have more of substance than in many a book of five hundred pages. It could be of great assistance to large numbers of trade union militants. Unfortunately, much of its value is offset by two serious blemishes.</p>

<p>The first is that the style and language is that of a piece written by an academic for academics. Here is a typical sentence. &#8216;The articulation of a strategy of incorporation in response to the chronic problems of the British economy clearly demonstrates the continued relevance of the first part of Trotsky&#8217;s argument&#8217;. I take this to mean the fact that the capitalist class and its governments try all the time to tie the trade unions to them by way of &#8216;consultation&#8217;, incomes policy, legislation to increase the power of the officials, etc, shows that Trotsky was right. Then why not say so in plain words? Words like &#8216;salience&#8217;, &#8216;overdetermined&#8217;, &#8216;parameter&#8217; and &#8216;normative&#8217; are no doubt the small change of sociological conversation but they are not part of everyday speech and their use, without explanation, is a hindrance to understanding. Having made this point I urge all our trade union members and sympathisers to make the effort to read and understand this pamphlet. It is worth it.</p>

<p>The other blemish can best be seen by comparing Hyman&#8217;s pamphlet with the Frow-Katanka book. There is very little theory in <strong>Strikes</strong>, indeed that is one of its main weaknesses. Yet its collection excerpts about forty-four disputes tells more about how things actually happen than any amount of learned discussions about &#8216;spontaneity&#8217; and &#8216;consciousness&#8217;. What is needed is a bringing together of the two approaches. One of the most interesting things in <strong>Strikes</strong> is the <strong>Strikers&#8217; Handbook</strong> &#8211; actually a communist policy guide of 1929.</p>

<p>Though completely ultra-left in its approach to the union leaderships and official organisations (it was written in the so-called &#8216;Third Period&#8217;) it is an illustration of the need for practical advice in the publications of a revolutionary socialist organisation. A few quotations will show what I mean.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;A strike committee must on no account adopt the standpoint of &#8220;All or Nothing&#8221;. In the course of the campaign the strike committee must be able to estimate correctly the correlation of forces and to manoeuvre ...&#8217;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;If wobbling is noticeable in the strike committee ... demand that the question be brought up for decision at mass meetings ...&#8217;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;Regular strike committee meetings and regular reports on its sessions to the participants of the struggle.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">A modern version, free from the ultra-left absurdities of Third Period Stalinism, is badly needed.</p>
