<p class="quoteb">Sir, we jointly and severally request your attention to the following requirements; namely, 2s 8d per day for our labour; hours from six till five and to close at three on Saturdays; and 4d an hour overtime.</p>

<p class="fst">It was in 1872 that farm labourers in South Warwickshire went on strike for these demands. There were 200 of them at first and then thousands as &#8220;a whole series of small strikes and lock-outs&#8221; developed. Out of this successful struggle &#8211; wages were pushed up in a year by twenty to twenty-five per cent &#8211; the agricultural workers union was born. By May 1873 it had grown, under the leadership of Joseph Arch, from nothing to 71,835 members.</p>

<p>It was widely believed that the agricultural labourers, &#8220;impoverished and hopelessly insecure&#8221;, were unorganisable. After the savage repression of attempts to hold up wages and to organise in the 1830s &#8211; the Tolpuddle Martyrs were agricultural labourers &#8211; a white terror ruled the English countryside. Under the three-fold despotism of Parson, Squire and Farmer, wielding as magistrates all the forces of &#8216;law and order&#8217;, the labourers were reduced to one remedy for their crying grievances &#8211; emigration, emigration to the towns or overseas. Arch and the Warwickshire labourers broke, for a time at least, that iron tyranny.</p>

<p>The inevitable counter-attack came in 1874. The employers resolving, typically, that &#8220;all union men be locked out after giving one week&#8217;s notice&#8221;. The union managed to survive that lock-out with 50,000 members left but repeated attacks in the years that followed, combined with &#8216;the great depression&#8217; of British agriculture, reduced it to a tenth of that number by 1889. By 1896 it had less than a thousand members and by the next year it was dead.</p>

<p>Or rather dormant. Something of the spirit survived and after fifteen years the union was re-established. This little booklet written for the centenary gives, as the union&#8217;s General Secretary says in his introduction, something of &#8220;the sight, sound and smell of poverty stirring and then embattled against exploitation.&#8221;</p>
