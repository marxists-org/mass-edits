<p class="info">From <strong>International Socialism</strong> (1st series), <a href="../../../../../history/etol/newspape/isj/index3.html#isj076" target="new">No.76</a>, March 1975, p.2.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="../../../../../admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Marxists&#8217; Internet Archive</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">A cynic might be forgiven for saying that what is promised for the next issue of the <strong>Journal</strong> is guaranteed not to appear. Apologies are due to readers for promises made and not kept.</p>

<p>There are two reasons for this kind of default. The first, and most important, is that comrades who have something useful and important to say are, by definition, heavily involved in activity of one kind or another and find it difficult to meet the copy deadlines imposed on us by the necessities of our printshop. Thus, the second part of Alistair Goulding&#8217;s article on <em>The Building Industry</em> does not, after all, appear in this issue because the writer has been so busy in the campaign to free the Shrewsbury Two that he was not able to complete it in time. It will appear in the April number.</p>

<p>The second reason is that of the problem of balance. It seemed to the Editor, that it would be a mistake, an overweighting of the <strong>Journal</strong> in a particular direction, to include both John Ure&#8217;s promised article (the first of four) on Marxian economics and Chris Harman&#8217;s <em>Marxist Economics and the world today</em> in one issue. A choice needed to be made.</p>

<p>The April Journal will feature <em>The Bosses&#8217; Market: Why we oppose it</em> and <em>Lenin</em>, a discussion article on the first volume of Tony Cliff&#8217;s new book.</p>

<p>Finally, the standard of proof reading and correction in <strong>IS 75</strong> was abysmal. Fortunately a comrade experienced in these matters, Geoff Ellen of <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, has volunteered to ensure that this does not happen again.</p>
