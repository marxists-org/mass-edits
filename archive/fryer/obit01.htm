<h3>Obituary</h3>

<h2>Terry Brotherstone</h2>

<h1>Peter Fryer</h1>

<h4>Communist journalist who told the truth about Hungary 1956</h4>

<h5>Friday November 3, 2006<br />
<em>The Guardian</em></h5>

<p class="fst">The death of Peter Fryer aged 79, comes 50 years to the week since his honest reporting of Hungary&#8217;s 1956 revolution for the <strong>Daily Worker</strong> (now the <strong>Morning Star</strong>) split the Communist party of Great Britain, and changed his own life. A loyal CP member since 1945, and a <strong>Worker</strong> journalist for nine years, he immediately wrote a short, passionate book <strong>Hungarian Tragedy</strong> in defence of the revolution&#8212;and was expelled from the party.</p>

<p>Fryer&#8217;s book has been compared to John Reed&#8217;s <strong>Ten Days that Shook the World</strong> on the Bolshevik uprising of 1917. A few days before he died, Fryer heard that Hungary&#8217;s president had awarded him the Knight&#8217;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic, in recognition of his &#8220;continuous support of the Hungarian revolution and freedom fight&#8221;.</p>

<p>Sent by the then <strong>Worker</strong> editor, Johnny Campbell, to report on a &#8220;counter-revolutionary&#8221; uprising, Fryer&#8217;s loyalty was to communism, Marx&#8217;s &#8220;truly human society&#8221;, not to the CPGB&#8217;s Stalinist line. Realising that he was witnessing a popular uprising of students and workers, he sided with the revolutionaries. His dispatches were savagely edited, then suppressed.</p>

<p>In 1949, Fryer had covered the Hungarian Stalinist regime&#8217;s show trial of Hungarian party leader, L&#225;szl&#243; Rajk. In good faith, he reported Rajk&#8217;s &#8220;confession&#8221;&#8212;made with the promise of being spared, but resulting in his execution&#8212;as proletarian justice. So, when the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev&#8217;s revelations about Stalinism at the 1956 Soviet Party congress were followed in Hungary by Rajk&#8217;s cynical &#8220;rehabilitation&#8221;, Fryer&#8217;s engagement with the CPGB&#8217;s crisis was personal. The &#8220;doubts and difficulties&#8221; shared by many members, for him meant confronting the part he felt he had played in Rajk&#8217;s murder.</p>

<p>Held up at a border town on the road from Vienna to Budapest, Fryer saw his first dead bodies&#8212;80 people shot during a demonstration. It was his turning-point. Attending the election of a workers&#8217; council at a state farm was the last straw. An apology that it was taking all day because &#8220;we have absolutely no experience of electing people&#8221; made him think: &#8220;So much for &#8216;people&#8217;s democracy&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>In late October 1956 there was a lull which followed from the brief Soviet withdrawal and ended with the Soviet army&#8217;s return to Budapest on November 4 to crush the revolution. During that period Fryer offered to edit an English-language paper, and he was proud to read, in a 1961 Hungarian emigr&#233; bibliography of the revolution that this was &#8220;of capital importance as regards the character of the insurrection: the only foreign journalist who decided to act for the sake of Hungary was a Communist&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Hungarian Tragedy</strong> played a big part in the CPGB&#8217;s fierce internal discussions which followed the Soviet invasion and led up to its Easter 1957 Hammersmith congress. But the party proved irredeemable. By then Fryer was working with the Trotskyist &#8220;club&#8221; of Gerry Healy (obituary December 18 1989), for which he edited the weekly <strong>Newsletter</strong> and co-edited <strong>Labour Review</strong>. These publications represent one of the few attempts by British Trotskyists to engage in serious dialogue and for a while they attracted a wide range of authors.</p>

<p>The narrow-minded, and sometimes brutal, authoritarianism Healy substituted for Marxist politics soon drove Fryer away. For quarter of a century, he lived another life, writing on the history of Portugal, Grundyism, censorship, and, above all, black history and music.</p>

<p>His best-known book, <strong>Staying Power</strong> (1984), on the black presence in Britain was followed by <strong>Rhythms of Resistance</strong> (2000), which makes a significant contribution to the study of the impact of African music in Latin America.</p>

<p>The son of a Hull master mariner, he won a scholarship to Hymers college in 1938. The young Fryer was impressed by the local Communist party&#8217;s opposition to Sir Oswald Mosley&#8217;s British Union of Fascists. But he was an anarchist until, inspired by the Red Army, and &#8220;a patriot of the Soviet Union&#8221;, he joined the Young Communist League in 1942.</p>

<p>He also gravitated towards journalism notably at the <strong>Yorkshire Post</strong>. But his CP membership and the paper&#8217;s Tory politics proved an unstable mix and on the last day of 1947 he joined the <strong>Daily Worker</strong>.</p>

<p>In the late 1980s the expulsion of Gerry Healy from what had become the Workers&#8217; Revolutionary Party allowed Fryer to return to the political dialogue left unfinished 30 years earlier. Fryer wrote a splendid column for the often rather earnest weekly <strong>Workers&#8217; Press</strong>.</p>

<p>In his last few weeks, he had a success as a pianist playing blues at the Caipirinha jazz bar in Archway, north London.</p>

<p>He is survived by Norma Meacock, his partner, and their son, two daughters and three grandchildren.</p>
