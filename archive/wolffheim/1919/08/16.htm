<h1>Factory Organizations or Trade Unions?</h1>
<h3>1919</h3>
<hr>

<p class="information">Original Title: <i>Betriebsorganisation oder Gewerkschaften?</i>, 
Hamburg, 1919. This pamphlet contains the text of a speech presented on August 
16, 1919 before the assembly of the Communist Party's Hamburg local. It was 
published "by unanimous consent of the assembly".</p>

<hr>

<p class="fst">The German revolution, whose political phase ended on November 9, 
1918, meant, in addition to the destruction of German imperialism by means of 
the war, the destruction of the entire German Empire as well. Once its military 
power was destroyed, and the workers and soldiers told the big landowners and 
princes to go to hell, the German Empire, as it had existed until that time, 
ceased to exist. The German Empire had been, since 1871, a bourgeois class state 
under the leadership of princes and big landowners. It is true of every state 
that it provides an organization for the people within its borders. All 
bourgeois class states involve the concentration of their inhabitants into one 
nation. A nation is the organization of the people under the leadership of the 
bourgeoisie. The founding of the nation means that the bourgeoisie is organized 
as the ruling class, and that it tries to make sure that the subject masses are 
either totally isolated or believe in an organization which cannot endanger 
bourgeois rule. As long as a bourgeois state is firmly rooted in the means of 
political power, the ruling class possesses the power to prevent the proletariat 
from creating a revolutionary organizational form. If the proletariat wants to 
organize, it must first acknowledge this state and unite within a framework 
which the latter generously concedes for a certain form of organization. When 
the proletariat began its class struggle it confronted the ruling bourgeoisie in 
a situation where it had no right to organize. So the struggle of the 
proletariat began with the struggle for its right to freedom of association. 
This is why, in a military-police-bureaucratic state like the German Empire 
after 1871, the struggle began with political forms. The political struggle had 
to build the foundations which would enable the proletariat to construct its own 
economic organization. The political struggle is also the vehicle for expanding 
the scope of the freedom conceded by the bourgeoisie to the proletariat to form 
its own organizations.</p>

<p class="fst">This is why, prior to the revolution, both the political and 
trade union movements, despite their laying claim to the revolutionary 
traditions of 1848, were essentially reformist. The workers movement was 
reformist because it recognized the class state, because its principle goal was 
to try to influence the rulers from within an institution of the class state, 
from inside parliament. It was reformist in its trade union struggles because, 
rather than organizing the working class with the objective of destroying the 
bourgeoisie, and abolishing the principle of hiring wage labor, its goal was to 
negotiate with the employers, guaranteeing their future existence, and thus to 
try to obtain more favorable wages and working conditions for particular sectors 
of the working class. And when the party and trade unions participated in the 
class struggle, they did so only within the framework of the existing state. 
Even in the heat of the struggle, in strikes, it was, for the trade unions, not 
a matter of attempting to destroy the bourgeoisie but of compelling particular 
groups to yield to certain demands of particular sectors of the working class, 
demands which were framed so that their satisfaction would be possible, and 
would by no means jeopardize the future prosperity of capital. This must be kept 
well in mind if we want to clearly understand whether the trade union form of 
pre-revolutionary times corresponds to the needs of the German proletariat now 
that it has carried out a political revolution. Having destroyed the power of 
the landowners and princes which the bourgeoisie had at its disposal, the 
originally political revolution has destroyed all powers which could have 
blocked the proletariat&#8217;s road to power. Then the proletariat faced the 
question: what kind of state should be organized? Should a capitalist state or a 
proletarian state be born? The old capitalist state was overthrown by the 
revolution; when it fell, there was no state at all, and the decision concerning 
what kind of state should replace the old one which had fallen was in the hands 
of the proletariat. The proletariat has not become aware of this fact; it was 
not accustomed to reflecting on the nature of the state. The proletariat had 
customarily restricted its efforts to gathering together a mountain of white 
slips of paper every five years, so that its so-called representatives could 
climb up to the heights of parliament. In matters relating to economic 
organization, the proletariat has been prone, or compelled, to yield all 
decision-making power to a small group of leaders, and to limit itself to paying 
its dues, so that a small number of leaders can enjoy a safe and secure 
existence. These were basically the functions of the proletariat in Germany, and 
if its trade union and political organizations were used for anything else, it 
was with the intention of transmitting the stultifying mental training for which 
the school and the barracks had so nobly prepared the German people, the party 
and the trade unions, as well as the workers, who might otherwise have developed 
revolutionary ideas. Since the only thing which the essence of the state has to 
deal with now is revolutionary activity, it tries with great determination to 
get the German proletarians to exercise themselves over the question of whether 
this or that indirect tax is more or less beneficial for the landowners, rather 
than the problem of analyzing the nature of bourgeois power, and what kind of 
power the proletariat has to create in order to eventually organize that power 
as a state. All the Kautskyists spoke of the conquest of power, but how to 
achieve this conquest is not the subject of their study, nor do they want the 
workers to attend to the matter. Now, when it has been two years since a 
proletariat which is not as cultivated as the German proletariat, the Russian 
working class, showed what means are required for the conquest of power, and 
upon what basis this power is subsequently organized, then all the Kautskyists 
come and implore the German people, for the love of God, not to imitate the 
&#8220;cruelties&#8221; unleashed by the destruction of the bourgeoisie as a class in 
Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">The German proletariat had grown accustomed to following its 
leaders; the whole world only appeared to it as a prison courtyard, and no one 
was more surprised by the successfully concluded German revolution than the 
German proletarians themselves. Had this not been the case, if their capacity to 
speak and to think had not been so astoundingly lost, then at that moment, at 
least, they would have asked what had to be done to defend the power they had 
conquered. This question would have been the question concerning the essence of 
the State.</p>

<p class="fst">Lassalle, who lived during an era when <i>bonzes</i> did not yet 
exist in the German workers movement, solved this problem. &#8220;The State&#8221;, he says, 
&#8220;is the concentration of all real means of power existing in a people.&#8221;<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> The 
concentration of machine guns and the press, the rule over the banks, the rule 
over the means of production, the concentration of all military and economic 
organizations, this is the State. And what is decisive for the rule of the State 
is the question of which class among its entire people possesses the strongest 
means of power.</p>

<p class="fst">The power of the High Command&#8217;s generals consisted in their 
control over the whole ensemble of great masses of arms and men. When this 
circumstance changed, when the workers and soldiers took all the means of power 
into their hands, and the other classes amounted to nothing, then all that had 
to be done was to organize this power and to add to it the rule over the press 
and the proletarian state would have come into existence. The institutions of 
this proletarian state developed quite spontaneously among the masses in the 
days of the revolution. The military organizations were in ruins, the police and 
the courts, as well as the administrative bureaucracy of the state, were 
paralyzed. To prevent chaos, and to organize economic relations, the workers and 
soldiers councils were organized throughout Germany, as if by a natural process, 
which in the first days of the revolution had concentrated all power into their 
hands. The union of all the German workers and soldiers councils and their solid 
foundation in the masses of working people, in the mines, in the factories, in 
the countryside&#8212;this organization was the State. Within the framework of this 
organization the proletarians who possessed arms would have created a military 
organization: the Red Army. It did not occur to the proletarians that it was 
necessary to immediately firmly safeguard their power and to reorganize it. 
Whenever they thought in terms of organizations, they had in mind the concepts 
of their old organizations, the social democratic parties and the trade unions, 
which were born in the class state, and had matured within it, and which had 
neither the will nor the ability to safeguard proletarian power, to organize the 
proletariat as a State; not only had these parties and trade unions been 
integrated into the bourgeois class State, they had also become an essential 
part of it, and when all the organizations of the bourgeois State trembled when 
everything collapsed, they did not tremble, they became the backbone of the 
reborn bourgeois State. This is how the proletariat of Germany was defeated by 
the German proletarians, who had, by means of their parties, their trade unions, 
and their leaders, allowed the old German Empire, with its &#8220;Reichstag&#8221; which had 
just been tossed into the gutter, to return in the guise of the national 
assembly. This is how the commanding heights of the party and the trade unions 
became the commanding heights of this State. And this is how, in the state which 
had been reconstructed in this manner, the proletarians were disarmed, and the 
white guards were armed.</p>

<p class="fst">That such a misfortune should have befallen the proletariat is 
due in part to the fact that it was by no means prepared to carry out a 
revolution. But besides this circumstance there is another one which is very 
important. The proletariat had been accustomed to view the revolution as 
essentially a political change, and thought that, once this political change had 
taken place, the other change would only be a question of time, and that when 
the old political forms are destroyed, there would be an evolution towards a 
socialist society, and that the proletarian struggle would no longer be 
necessary. And, once again, it was the social democratic party and the trade 
unions which nourished this belief within the proletariat, and which had 
forgotten, or wanted to forget, to explain to the proletariat that the 
proletarian revolution is not exhausted in bringing about changes in political 
forms, but is essentially an economic revolution, a revolution whose task is to 
basically revolutionize the whole economy. If the political revolution was 
carried out by means of the uprising in the streets, the same cannot be true of 
the economic revolution, which cannot be accomplished by means of armed actions, 
but must take place where the economic process has its roots&#8212;in the factories. 
When it is a matter of providing a country&#8217;s economy with a completely new 
economic foundation, one must go to the roots of the economy, so it is not 
enough to rectify some random surface phenomena of the existing economy. Its 
roots are in the factories, that is why the revolutionary economic struggle of 
the workers begins in the factories themselves. And if the revolutionary 
struggle of the proletarians begins and ends in the factories, and if the goal 
of this struggle is to put these factories at the service of the proletariat, 
then the only way to organize the proletariat for this struggle is on the basis 
of the factory organization.</p>

<p class="fst">The old trade unions were created during an era when the 
proletariat did not find itself in the midst of an economic revolution. 
Capitalism was still expanding, attaining higher forms, and Germany was still 
undergoing industrial-capitalist ascent. In those days, when the trade unions 
began to unite the proletariat within the entire people, capitalism was still 
split into factions. Many businesses still competed with one another. At that 
time it was not a question of destroying the bourgeoisie as a class, because it 
was still in the process of forming itself as a class. Then, it was only a 
question of obtaining better wages and working conditions for certain layers of 
the working class. And at that time, the old trade union form did correspond to 
the needs of the proletarians. Skilled workers were still predominant in large 
sectors of the working masses, and there were still small and medium-sized 
enterprises everywhere, with only occasional large businesses. The trade unions 
organized the workers by trade, and made the worker&#8217;s neighborhood, rather than 
his factory, the basis of his trade union membership. All the questions of the 
trade union struggle were handled by trade union officials or at membership 
meetings, and were by no means decided where the workers find themselves day and 
night: in the factories.</p>

<p class="fst">Even before the war, this form of organization rendered the 
workers incapable of putting their forces to the test against capitalism in mass 
strikes. Because the old trade unions had fragmented the masses into groups 
defined by trade, they did not have the mass strike in their programs. As a 
result, the great shipyard workers strike of 1913 was defeated, because the 
workers&#8217; form of organization was not suited to the needs of a mass 
organization. The old trade unions were organizations of leaders who carried out 
the bulk of trade union activity; it was the leaders, not the masses, who 
negotiated. The leaders did not want the masses themselves to carry out actions. 
For these leaders, the strike was a last resort to be utilized in emergencies, 
rather than the natural weapon which the strike constitutes in a revolutionary 
period. In a revolutionary period it is no longer only a matter of improving 
working conditions, because capitalism is dying, capitalist society can no 
longer improve working conditions: now it is a question of destroying capitalist 
society. This can only be done by means of a continuous series of revolutionary 
mass strikes which, constantly spreading and successively embracing all 
industries, will shake the economy of the whole country to its very foundations 
and finally compel the capitalist class to declare bankruptcy. It is bankrupt 
now, but does it abandon all attempts to stage a recovery, or does it confess 
its incompetence? No, the capitalist class does no such thing; it cannot do 
that, that would mean suicide. This will only happen when the proletariat 
compels the capitalist class to do it. The principle means to achieve this goal 
is the revolutionary strike.</p>

<p class="fst">This strike, which can break out because of simple economic 
demands, possesses a political dimension because it affects the masses in such a 
manner as to threaten the existence of the whole economy by spreading to other 
sectors of the economy. This has been clearly demonstrated by the miners strike. 
Due to a shortage of coal, railroad operations were curtailed and the transport 
of commodities was paralyzed. Whether or not the miners were aware of this, the 
fact that they joined the strike as one great mass itself has had political 
effects. And this is the second reason why the old trade unions are incapable of 
leading the struggle of the working class during revolutionary times. The trade 
unions are prepared for partial economic struggles; the old social democratic 
party is prepared for political-parliamentary struggles. A struggle which is 
revolutionary, and simultaneously economic and political, can only be carried 
out by the masses themselves. This is only possible within organizations which 
are created for the purpose of conducting such struggles. Where these struggles 
have broken out, where the workers have plainly seen the incompetence of the old 
trade unions is where this new form has now become a reality. The miners 
organized by mines, and among the mines by regions, and all the districts 
together into a <i>Union</i> which includes all the workers in the industry. 
Since the miners have discovered this new form, the shipyard workers have now 
also finally begun to discuss this new form of organization. In the shipyards 
they, too, are joining workplace organizations, in order to then unite these 
workplace organizations in a single <i>Union</i> of Shipyard Workers. There is 
also the <i>Deutscher Seemannsbund</i> (Seaman&#8217;s Organization) and an 
industry-wide organization of the German railroad workers is being debated 
throughout the country. The German railroad workers have only just recently been 
pushed into the free trade unions,<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> and they have already begun to create a 
new revolutionary trade union based on workplace organizations. In Halle as in 
Berlin and Hamburg, they have independently elaborated the organizational forms 
which they intend to combine into a unitary organization, based on workplace 
organizations. These preparatory labors are quite advanced, and if not this lost 
strike, then the next defeat will compel the railroad workers to turn their 
backs on the old trade union, and to find an organizational form which makes it 
possible for them to develop freely within the struggle without the restraints 
imposed by the trade union&#8217;s centralized bureaucracy, which is so intimately 
intertwined with the state, and which in fact defends the interests of German 
state power. There is also a Bargemen&#8217;s <i>Union</i> in Upper Silesia, and I 
have been informed that efforts are now taking place in Hamburg to unite the 
barge and river transport workers into a unitary organization.</p>

<p class="fst">There is still a great deal of hesitation; many workers still 
feel a certain fondness for their trade unions due to old habits. But 
revolutionary times demand revolutionary decisions, and whoever makes 
sentimentality the basis of their activity can win three political revolutions 
but then lose them because of the lack of an economic organization, just as the 
German proletariat has come to lose almost everything it gained after the first 
German revolution. The German proletariat, which is ready to conquer state power 
so as to organize a socialist economy, cannot do so unless it has first 
organized itself for this economy. If socialism is to be more than merely a 
bureaucratic scheme in which, instead of local employers, a centralized 
bureaucracy directs the economic process, and rules the working masses, as is 
now being attempted, then the proletariat must organize against the centralized 
bureaucracy in order to become a pillar of the productive process. This is the 
difference, and this is why the trade unions hate the factory organizations.</p>

<p class="fst">A trust, which is a kind of North American corporate entity, can 
dissolve itself today, and reorganize itself in a new form tomorrow. This is a 
completely natural process for it when it encounters obstacles which impede its 
operations. The trade unions, however, cannot dissolve themselves after a 
revolution in order to reorganize on a new basis. They have to preserve their 
old centralization, their old bureaucracy, and do so in order to organize the 
white guards to make factory organizations impossible even before they arise. 
This is how things stand now. Today, when the workers are well enough organized 
to begin the process of transformation, where they have a sensible leadership, 
the trade union bureaucracy joins the white guards to fight against those who 
want to form revolutionary trade unions.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> If a trade union were to be 
dissolved, and the next day, the workers were to begin signing up for the new 
form of organization, what would such an event signify? It would signify that 
the masses would have an organizational form in which they could freely develop 
all of their forces. For the leaders of the trade unions, however, it would mean 
they would no longer be needed, and this is why the bureaucracy will not agree 
to such a thing, and are merciless with the factory organizations.</p>

<p class="fst">As everyone knows, we have the enterprise councils,<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> which 
will be institutionalized in the recently-created bourgeois class State. This 
State will give the councils a few rights, and more duties. Their principle duty 
will consist of endeavoring, together with the employers, to increase each 
enterprise&#8217;s productivity. This cannot be the task of the revolutionary factory 
councils. As long as the class State exists, the proletariat is at war, and the 
factory councils must be organs of the revolutionary struggle. They must 
unilaterally defend the interests of the workers, even if this means that the 
enterprise goes bankrupt ten times, since, in this economic order, it is not 
interested in assuring profitability. The proletariat today has no interest at 
all in the recovery of the capitalist economy, but in its collapse. Each step 
towards recovery is a step backwards for the proletariat. Each increase in the 
profitability of any enterprise only fixes the chain more firmly which has once 
again bound the hands of the proletariat after the political revolution. But if 
the factory councils are not to be institutions dedicated to preserving 
capitalist exploitation, but rather institutions of the struggle of the 
revolutionary proletariat, then they must not be controlled by the 
counterrevolutionary trade unions, which are institutions of the class State, 
but, instead, by the workers in the factories. The workers should not consent to 
any interference whatsoever in the running of these enterprise councils, 
especially by the trade unions. For this reason, as well, the proletariat needs 
factory organizations. Only if all the proletarians in an enterprise are united 
in a factory organization would they be capable of controlling everything that 
happens in the workplace. As long as this organizational form does not exist, 
the proletarians will be dispersed. Therefore, if you want to put an end to this 
dispersion into trade unions and parties, this can only be achieved if a new 
form of unity is created, a form of unity in which all the workers, whatever 
their trade, or their party, can together coordinate the affairs of the 
enterprise. This would only be possible in a factory organization. If the 
workers in a factory have to work together, regardless of which political 
tendencies they endorse, they could also carry out negotiations with each other 
and manage their own affairs within the factory.</p>

<p class="fst">The only condition for membership which the factory organization 
will have to establish, besides getting out of the trade unions, is that each 
member must defend the principle of the proletarian class struggle, and that he 
share the conviction that there can be no peace between the employers and the 
proletarians as long as the class State exists. A declaration to that effect is 
completely sufficient. This will keep out all those elements which used to be 
called &#8220;yellow&#8221;, and unite all the revolutionary workers, even if their 
political positions diverge on some points (which is of no account for activity 
within the factory), in a unitary struggle against the employer, and against the 
employers as a class.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not by chance that it is just now, in Germany, where the 
political revolution has given way to the economic revolution, that this form of 
organization is beginning to prevail. In other countries, where police powers 
are more limited, and where capitalist democracy, such as we now have in 
Germany, already existed, the workers have long been organized in accordance 
with these perspectives. In North America, the &#8220;Industrial Workers of the World&#8221; 
discovered this form of organization many years ago, and has been applying 
methods which seem new to us here in Germany.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> Just as the &#8220;Industrial Workers 
of the World&#8221; began to win the masses over to its principles at the moment that 
it became clear that social contradictions had become so exacerbated that there 
could no longer be any concessions in the struggle against the trusts, and that 
the capitalist economy had to be destroyed, so here in Germany, the idea of the 
&#8220;<i>Allgemeine Arbeiterunion</i>&#8221; (General Workers Union) began to spread at the 
moment when the proletarians of Germany understood that being revolutionary 
involves more than just making or listening to revolutionary speeches, that 
revolutionary ideas must be transformed into revolutionary action, and that 
without revolutionary action the economic revolution cannot be completed even if 
the economic conditions are ripe for such a transformation. Today this implies 
that the proletarians must be convinced that they have to break with the old 
trade union forms, which did good work in the past, but which today comprise a 
counterrevolutionary element, and that it is of the utmost importance to 
concentrate all their forces in revolutionary organizations which can engage in 
the revolutionary struggle, and which will later be capable of taking control of 
industry. Who should control industry? Should it be the trade union offices, or 
do the workers want to control it themselves? If the workers want to control 
industry, they have to create an organizational form capable of making them 
masters of production. This form is the council regime, and the basic unit of 
the council regime is the factory council: but the factory council can play this 
role only if it is rooted in the factory organization. If not, it would be a 
falsification of the idea of the council. It would not, in such a case, be an 
instrument of the revolutionary struggle, but a deceit to confuse the 
proletarians about what methods to choose for that struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">Whoever has a firm determination to assure that power remains in 
the hands of the proletariat, must also be sure of the road to follow. Whoever 
wants the political struggle to end in the dictatorship of the proletariat, and 
the economic struggle to result in the transfer of production into the hands of 
the proletariat, can only have one slogan:</p>

<p class="indentb"><i>Get out of the trade unions</i>,<br>
<i>Create factory organizations!</i></p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1]</a> This is certainly not a quote from any of Lassalle&#8217;s writings. 
Lassalle often dilated on the purpose of the state. To the &#8220;night-watchman idea&#8221; 
of the state, which, according to Lassalle, the bourgeois maintains, Lassalle 
opposes the &#8220;idea of the state of the workers as a whole&#8221; (to be realized by 
universal suffrage), which would be identical to the idea of the state. Lassalle 
meant all those who have a part in productive activity, be it manual, 
administrative, scientific, educational, etc. The state would then be the &#8220;unity 
of all individuals in an ethical whole, a unity which will multiply the 
individuals&#8217; forces a million-fold. Its purpose will be the education and 
development of the human species towards freedom&#8221;. Ferdinand Lassalle, <i>
Gesammelte Reden und Schriften</i>, edited and with an introduction by Eduard 
Bernstein, Vol. II, Berlin, 1919, p. 195 <i>et seq</i>., and pp. 240-241. The 
quotations are from the following works: 1) <i>Arbeiterprogramm Uber den 
besonderen Zusammenhang der gegenwärtigen Geschichtsepoche mit der Idee des 
Arbieterstandes</i> (speech before a Berlin artisans&#8217; society in 1862); 2) <i>
Die Wissenschaft und die Arbeiter</i>. A speech in his own defense before the 
Berlin Criminal Court, against the accusation of having publicly incited the 
non-possessing classes to hatred and contempt for the possessing classes. (That 
is, in the &#8220;Workers Program&#8221;. The trial took place in 1863.)</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n2" href="#fn2">[2]</a> As a result of the legalization of freedom of association for 
certain categories of workers (the railroad workers, for example), there were no 
longer any obstacles standing in the way of joining a trade union for those 
workers affected by the new law. Note that the &#8220;free trade unions&#8221; are the 
social democratic trade unions.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n3" href="#fn3">[3]</a> In 1919/1920, the expression &#8220;revolutionary trade unions&#8221; was 
also used by other left communists, who would later&#8212;at least after their break 
with the &#8220;Red Trade Union International&#8221;&#8212;consider it a contradiction in terms.</p>
