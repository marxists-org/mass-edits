    <P>The <I>Fahne des Kommunismus</I> carries two letters from Trotsky, in
      which he takes a position on our group.</P>
    
    <P>Trotsky sums up his general evaluation of us In the following sentences:</P>
    
    <P>&#147;Truly I needed no time ... in order to ascertain that the
      Brandler-Thalheimer group stands on the other side of the barricades ...
      Our task consists in explaining that the Brandlerite faction is only a new
      gateway to the social democracy...</P>
    
    <P>Of course one can say that this is an exaggeration: Brandler and
      Thalheimer are not yet social democrats. Of course, they are not <B>yet</B>
      social democrats and, of course, they are not the <B>present</B> social
      democracy, but one must understand how to observe phenomena In their
      development ... Permit me to remind you once more, that young,
      particularly oppositional, opportunist factions, are no 'nicer' in
      relation to the old social chauvinist parties, than a little piglet is
      'nicer' than an old swine&#148;.</P>
    
    <P>In order to make such a 'ascertainment', Trotsky, of course, did not
      need much time. He has simply repeated what the official Comintern press
      says. The only original thing in his 'ascertainment' is the choice of
      abusive terminology, which demonstrates in Trotsky an otherwise wholly
      unusual preoccupation with rustic psychology and the problems of livestock
      farming.</P>
    
    <P>This manner in which Trotsky treats the questions of the international
      labour movement shows, how right we were, in describing him as the<B>
      most consistent representative of ultra-left politics</B>.</P>
    
    <P>While those faithful to the party-line still attempt to cobble together
      an 'analysis' of the objective situation, out of scraps of theses and
      newspaper clippings, in order to conceal their nakedness. Trotsky scorns
      all such apparel, even those reminding him from afar of the pedantic
      customs of earlier times.</P>
    
    <P>He does not even make an attempt to examine the objective situation in
      the different countries, the relationship of class forces, or the
      perspectives of the class struggle. He has his own infallible yardstick
      with which he separates the righteous from the unrighteous and places them
      on the different sides of the barricades.</P>
    
    <P>The decisive questions for him are: The attitude towards 1923, to the
      Anglo-Russian Committee, to the Chinese Revolution, and to the theory of
      the building of socialism in one country.</P>
    
    <P>Here anyone not swearing on the Trotskyist formula stands on the other
      side of the barrier, pardon, the barricade, which separates the small
      Trotskyist groups from the earthly world and its problems. The present
      questions of the international labour movement, the present tasks of the
      revolutionary workers, are absent from the Trotskyist creed. Here the
      slogan holds good - to paraphrase Heine: &#147;The earth we relinquish to
      the piglets and the swine&#148;.</P>
    
    <P>Trotsky literally says:</P>
    
    <P>&#147;Today it is an honour for any genuine revolutionary to remain a
      `sectarian&#146;&#148;.</P>
    
    <P>We, the Opposition in Germany are also a minority and we are not afraid
      of being a minority. But we are not a sect and we have no wish to be one.
      We agree with Marx who, at beginning of the labour movement when it did
      nit yet contain masses always fought sectarianism with all his strength. A
      minority does not need to be a sect. It can become one at the moment it,
      instead of participating in the movement oi the great masses, instead of
      seeing its aim as looking clatter their interests, boxes itself off from
      it, if it concerns itself with problems not connected with this movement,
      but which have been <B>especially chosen for a purpose</B>.</P>
    
    <P>Trotsky&#146;s confession of sectarianism is therefore much nearer the
      truth than he himself suspects. Sectarianism is the content of the
      activity of Trotsky and his adherents. For example, it is characteristic
      that Trotsky states, <B>by the way</B>, the necessity of a platform of
      transitional demands and a correct tactic in the trades unions. But he
      does not believe that to be decisive. What is decisive is, <B>how one
      stands regarding his creed</B>. What one should do today, the practical
      tasks, are secondary for him. How that manifests itself can be seen with
      Trotsky&#146;s adherent <B>Urbahns</B>. The Leninbund is one day in
      favour of work in the trade unions, another day for the
      struggle-leaderships. They get their day-to-day slogans now from the KPD
      CC, and then from us. They do not know what they want. If one is a bit
      sharp with them, then at each appropriate and inappropriate opportunity,
      they fire off the Trotskyist article of faith, whereupon the theory of the
      building of socialism in one country is the source of all evil. That is
      the purest type of sectarianism.</P>
    
    <P>Today the conflict over the united front tactic and the trade union
      question is occupying all sections of the Comintern. But these are not
      decisive questions for Trotsky. Decisive are 1923, the Anglo-Russian
      Committee, etc, etc. As long as the world has not recognised that Trotsky
      was correct in all these questions, he generously leaves it to itself in
      its own filth, until then he does not concern himself with the <B>situation
      today and what is happening today</B>.</P>
    
    <P>But now to the content of the Trotskyist article of faith. On 1923 he
      says:</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>&#147;It (Brandler's policy) led to the great catastrophe in
      late 1923 &#133;.. This catastrophe is the political precondition for the
      subsequent stabilisation of European capitalism..&#148;</BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <P>In a word: Brandler has stabilised capitalism. No one else has yet
      formulated the October Legend so crudely. One arrives at such conclusions
      when one is, like Trotsky, of the opinion that in 1923 all the
      preconditions for a victorious armed uprising were present, and that it
      all failed only because Brandler and Thalheimer had overslept. The
      question of whether the conditions existed in October 1923, that Lenin
      named in 1917 as the preconditions for the uprising, is not posed by
      Trotsky. An examination of the objective situation in 1923 does not
      interest him.</P>
    
    <P>On the question of the Anglo-Russian Committee we took a position at the
      time (in the circle of some comrades, as a public appearance was not
      possible), against both Stalin as well as against Trotsky and Zinoviev. We
      are of the opinion that negotiations at the top level with the reformists
      cannot be fundamentally opposed, but under certain circumstances are
      necessary and useful. Only one should not, of course, want to sit at a
      table with the reformists merely for conversing together, but only when it
      concerns a distinct practical aim. During its first stage of existence the
      Anglo-Russian Committee served just such a distinct aim, namely the
      struggle for a united trade union international. Later, however, as this
      slogan was dropped, the Anglo-Russian Committee ceased to have any
      immediate practical significance and actually transformed itself into an
      opportunist top-level combination. It adopted decisions on all sorts of
      questions, and everyone knew that they were only generalities which
      committed nobody to anything. Trotsky&#146;s attitude to the Anglo-Russian
      Committee is, however, different to ours. He represented the viewpoint
      that it was inadmissible to sit at a table with Purcell, ie, the <B>old
      ultra-left attitude towards the united front tactic</B>.</P>
    
    <P>Neither were we in agreement with Stalin or Trotsky on the <B>Chinese
      Question</B>. We were against the policy of unconditional support to the
      Kuomintang. We criticised that in order to get unity with the Kuomintang,
      one paralysed the proletarian class struggle in China, held the mass
      movement back, throttled strikes, etc. We were however, simultaneously,
      against the attitude of Trotsky and his friends, who were against any,
      even transitory, collaboration with the national- revolutionary
      bourgeoisie. By the way, today Karl <B>Radek</B>, who in his time, was in
      agreement with Trotsky on the Chinese Question and was the
      China-specialist of the Opposition, also states, that Trotsky&#146;s
      attitude to the Chinese Question stood in direct contradiction with that
      of Lenin. Recently Trotsky has namely advanced the view that in China only
      the slogan of the socialist dictatorship of the proletariat is valid, but
      not that of the democratic dictatorship of workers and peasants. According
      to Trotsky then, the bourgeois, the national, the agrarian revolution in
      China is already concluded.</P>
    
    <P>In a previous issue we have already taken a position on Trotsky&#146;s
      hobby-horse, the <B>theory of the building of socialism in one country</B>.
      As far as we are concerned, as regards the Soviet Union, another question
      seems to be decisive. Namely, that of whether the Soviet Union is a
      dictatorship of the proletariat or not. Among the Russian Trotskyists the
      discussion over this question resulted in sharp differences and has led to
      a split in the group. In a letter, Trotsky advanced the view that the
      Stalin-Rykov block was an expression of the middle-peasants and the
      kulaks. His closest Russian adherents are of the view that Soviet Russia
      is governed by a &quot;block of the reactionary elements or the town and
      the village&quot;. That in not our view but that of the social democracy.
      We are by no means inclined to identify with Stalin's policies from A to
      Z, nor to ignore the deficiencies of the CPSU's policies, but the starting
      point for our criticism is the fact that the Soviet Union is a Workers&#146;
      State. We criticise that which is inappropriate from the standpoint of the
      maintenance and the strengthening of the proletarian dictatorship and the
      socialist construction. However, we stand with the Soviet Union against
      the capitalist world on one side of the barricade! But here Trotsky has
      lost his war.</P>
    
    <P>Trotsky turns against our criticism our position on the peasant question
      in Russia and writes:</P>
    
    <P>&#147;The middle layer of the peasantry represents a social protoplasm.
      It uninterruptedly and unalterably assumes certain forms in two
      directions: towards capitalist ones through the kulaks and towards
      socialist ones through the semi-proletarians and agricultural labourers.
      Anyone who ignores this fundamental process, anyone who speaks of the
      peasantry in general, anyone who does not see that the 'peasantry' has two
      hostile faces, is irretrievably lost&#148;.</P>
    
    <P>The confirmation that a differentiation occurs among the middle
      peasantry, that it unceasingly separates out into proletarianised and
      capitalist elements, should on no account induce us to not notice the fact
      that today the majority of the population of the Soviet Union consists of
      neither agricultural labourers nor of kulaks, but of middle peasants.
      Trotsky disregards this fact and that is what we criticise him for.</P>
    
    <P>Therefore Trotsky&#146;s article of faith does not accord with our
      conception. We are unable to adhere to any of the points mentioned by him.
      The falseness of this article of faith is also shown <B>by its blocking
      the way of Trotsky and his adherents from dealing with the present
      political problems</B>.</P>
    
    <P>Trotsky has, for his part, gained sympathy with many, particularly
      outside Russia, who were dissatisfied with the ruling party regime. This
      sympathy holds good for those persecuted by Stalin. Numerous groups in
      different countries which otherwise uphold the most contradictory
      conceptions adhere to Trotsky. However, personal sympathies for a leader
      who has gained great merit in the past are not a suitable basis for a
      political association. That requires principled agreement. All the groups
      adhering to Trotsky have necessarily ended up in the <B>channel of
      sectarianism</B>. All the groups not wanting to pursue ultra-left politics
      have gradually distanced themselves from Trotsky.</P>
    
    <P>At the moment in which Trotsky makes the attempt to set up his
      Trotskyist International from Constantinople, a large part of his
      adherents in almost all countries have already left him or are about to do
      so.</P>
    
    <P>What is gathering around Trotsky is a sect, which swears allegiance to
      the great leader and his article of faith. Anyone who has doubt will be
      rejected, as with Souvarine in France, who did have great personal
      sympathies for Trotsky, but in some questions dared to have his own
      opinion.</P>
    
    <P>Trotsky is infallible after all. In one of his recent articles on <I>The
      Permanent Revolution and the Line of Lenin</I>, he states, that Lenin
      polemicised against him without having read Trotsky&#146;s fundamental
      work on the Russian Revolution of 1905.</P>
    
    <P>Those who refuse to go along with such a game, ourselves, for example,
      get excommunicated by Trotsky.</P>
    
    <P>This method seems familiar to us. It is not patented by Trotsky. It in a
      poor imitation of the methods of the Comintern apparatus.</P>
    
    <P>It is a sad image presented by Trotsky, when he sets himself up in
      Constantinople as a Anti-Pope and dispatches his excommunications. He will
      not gain anything for the future by that, but only blot out the memory of
      his past.</P>

    <P CLASS="pagenoteb">The two letters which appeared in <I>Fahne des

      and 12.6.29 respectively, can be found in <I>Writings of Leon Trotsky
