    <P class="pagenoteb">This piece is a section of a much longer document written by Thalheimer
      in response to the programme drafted (mainly by Bukharin) for the
      Communist International's Sixth Congress in 1928. The document was
      retrieved from the SED (East German Communist Party) archives and
      published in 1993 by Decaton, Mainz, as <I>Programmatische Fragen: Kritik
      des Programmentwurfs der Komintem (V1. Weltkongreis), </I>with a foreword
      by Theodor Bergmann. We are grateful to Mike Jones for providing a
      translation.</P>
    
    <P>This part seems to me to be the weakest in the whole draft. It is also
      the most important for those sections of the CI [Communist International]
      which still face the task of winning the majority of the working class for
      the principles and aims of Communism, thus to create the organisational
      and ideological preconditions for the struggle for the proletarian
      dictatorship.</P>
    
    <P>This task still faces such important sections of the CI as the German,
      French, Italian, Polish, Czechoslovak, etc. I have mentioned here sections
      of the CI which are already mass <I>parties. </I>Some sections of the CI
      have not even reached this level yet. They are not yet mass parties, but
      rather small groups with small circles around them, whose activity is
      dominated by propaganda. Other sections may still be in the very early
      stage of circles. The borders here are of course not fixed, but fluid.
      However, it seems <I>useful </I>to us to make this classification.</P>
    
    <P>In this part, the insufficient participation of the non-Russian sections
      in elaborating the draft is most perceptible. The tactical and strategical
      experiences of the individual sections are much richer, more multifarious,
      more specific, than it appears in this part. Of course, this part of the
      programme of the International cannot merely consist of a juxtaposition,
      nor a mere addition, to the experience of the individual sections. It
      should represent the general viewpoints which result from these tactical
      experiences. This also accords with the well-known decision of the Fourth
      Congress [of the CI], in which Lenin played a decisive role. Moreover, it
      also accords with the conception that I represented here. I would not have
      considered it worth mentioning if some comrades had not tried to distort
      the conceptions represented there by me (on behalf of, and in agreement
      with, the KPI) [German Communist Party]). One has only to compare the
      texts of the reports, such as that of the resolution drawn up at the
      Fourth Congress, to completely clarify things. If necessary that can be
      checked later. I am not in possession of the texts in question at present</P>
    
    <P>It would also surely have been beneficial for the elaboration of this
      part if the most important sections of the Comintern had complied with the
      instructions by the ECCI [Executive Committee of the CI] years ago:
      namely, to elaborate Action Programmes for their countries. As far as I
      know, an elaborated draft of a long-term Action Programme only exists on
      the part of the Italian section. In this regard, it indicates a maturity
      above the average of the other sections.</P>
    
    <P>In our German section there is, as is known, a toing and froing in
      opinion on whether a long-term Action Programme is in accordance with the
      principles of the CI or not. The view was presented here that an Action
      Programme should only contain partial or day-to-day demands (minimum
      demands as they used to be called), which could be shifted out within 24
      hours.</P>
    
    <P>I regard this view as false. It is not in accord with the
      above-mentioned instruction from the Executive to the individual sections
      to elaborate their Action Programmes. It certainly did not intend a mere
      collation of partial and day-to-day demands. These might have to be
      changed a short notice, often from one day to the next. They shun a
      concrete fixation for longer periods. In addition, this view contradicts
      the fact of the Action Programme of the Italian section. It also
      contradicts the decisions of the Third Congress, in which Lenin played
      such a decisive role. And, finally, it contradicts the conception of the
      practice of Marx and Engels.</P>
    
    <P>On the other hand, it accords with the Erfurt Programme. It is a relapse
      into an obsolete stage of the workers' movement.</P>
    
    <P>Now we come to the question of <I>transitional slogans </I>in general,
      and to the question whether transitional slogans <I>may be propagated in
      non-acute revolutionary situations.</I></P>
    
    <P>According to rumours of which I have become aware, some comrades have
      accused me of a frightful theoretical misunderstanding of the meaning of
      the transitional slogans of Marx and Engels. In the opinion of Marx and
      Engels they should only be propagated in an acute revolutionary situation,
      in the revolutionary overturn itself.</P>
    
    <P>Furthermore: with transitional slogans in the sense of Marx and Engels
      are meant slogans that could only be <I>realised after </I>the conquest
      of power by the working class. The grave theoretical mistake here is
      wholly on the side of the comrades who mention the above described
      conception.</P>
    
    <P>In the <I>Communist Manifesto, </I>Marx and Engels speak of 'despotic
      inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois
      production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically
      insufficient and untenable, but which, m the course of the movement
      outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social
      order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode
      of production'. <I>Which transition </I>should these demands or measures
      effect? That from the capitalist to the socialist mode of production. <I>Which
      force </I>should effect this transition? The working class, which 'raises
      itself to the position of ruling class', which conquers 'political power',
      which has won 'the battle of democracy'. The word democracy, used here by
      Marx and Engels without further definition, would appear to mean the
      workers' and peasants ' democratic dictatorship. The revolutionary
      democracy of the Jacobins and not the parliamentary form. The proletarian
      dictatorship was defined in more detail by them to signify the <I>smashing
      of the bourgeois stale machine </I>only after the experience of the
      Commune.</P>
    
    <P>Which demands or measures are posed here by Marx and Engels for
      fulfilment after the conquest of power?</P>
    
    <P>The <I>Communist Manifesto </I>says in this regard:</P>
    
    <P>'These measures will of course be different in different countries.
      Nevertheless, in the most advanced countries, the following will be pretty
      generally applicable</P>
    <OL class="numbered">
      <LI> Abolition of property in land and application of all rents to public
        purposes. </LI>
      <LI> A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. </LI>
      <LI> Abolition of all rights of inheritance. </LI>
      <LI> Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.. </LI>
      <LI> Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State, by means of a
        national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly. </LI>
      <LI> Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the
        hands of the State. </LI>
      <LI> Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the
        State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement
        of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan. </LI>
      <LI> Equal liability of all to labour. Establishment of industrial
        armies, especially for agriculture. </LI>
      <LI> Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual
        abolition of the distinction between town and country by a more equable
        distribution of the population over the country. </LI>
      <LI> Free education for an children in public schools. Abolition of
        children's factory labour in its present form. Combination of education
        with industrial production, etc.' </LI>
    </OL>
    
    <P>As one can immediately see, here it is a question of exclusively
      transitional <I>measures after the conquest of power </I>by the working
      class. Hence, they are mostly maximum slogans (except for the 'heavy
      progressive tax', although it too has a revolutionary meaning here).</P>
    
    <P>Transitional slogans in the sense of the tactical theory of the Third
      Congress of the CI are, by their nature, as by the period of their use,
      something else. They are slogans which <I>in the course of the struggle
      </I>for power, that is, in an acutely revolutionary situation, are take:n
      up and partially realised, even before the working class has established
      its state power, but where it is already capable, in a number of areas, if
      not yet in a centralised form, of weakening capitalist rule in the
      factories and the bourgeois state power, and of strengthening its own
      class power. The implementation of these measures against the resistance
      of the bourgeoisie, the attempt to extend them, unfolds the question of
      power in its full extent. The resistance of the bourgeoisie poses for the
      working class the alternative: either to wholly lose the partial gains
      again or to continue advancing further.</P>
    
    <P>In Soviet Russia in 1917, the most important of these transitional
      slogans were workers' control of production and the arming of the workers.</P>
    
    <P>Upon the establishment of the proletarian state power these slogans are
      out of date, as the struggle advances.. Control of the factories by the
      workers is superseded by complete expropriation of the capitalist factory
      manager and management of the factories by the organs of the workers'
      state. Then workers' control assumes new forms and becomes a subordinate
      issue. At the same time it becomes generalised. The aiming of the workers
      in the course of the struggle for power is replaced, after the seizure of
      power, by the state aiming of the workers and disarming of the
      bourgeoisie. The Red Army, etc., takes the place of the Red Guards, etc.</P>
    
    <P>One has simply allowed oneself to be led astray by the common word
      'transitional' in the expressions transitional <I>measures </I>in the
      sense of the <I>Communist Manifesto </I>and transitional <I>slogans </I>in
      the sense of the Third Congress. In the one and the other case it concerns
      in essence <I>different transitions </I>and therefore different <I>periods
      of struggle. </I>In the one case it means measures of the <I>victorious
      </I>proletarian revolution, in the other case slogans and actions of the
      working class struggling for power. If I envisage only the word
      'transition', without considering from what to what is the transition,
      then the change of the socialist society into the communist is also a
      'transition' with corresponding transitional measures, slogans and
      phenomena. In the first case it concerns the period of the proletarian
      dictatorship; in the second, the period of the conquest of power. But
      maximum slogans as well as transitional slogans are propaganda slogans,
      before they become slogans of action- And, indeed, in the propaganda,
      maximum and transitional slogans must be linked to each other, the maximum
      slogans must be derived from the transitional slogans.</P>
    
    <P>Demands of the second character, that is in the sense of transitional
      slogans, are not contained in the <I>Communist Manifesto, </I>but in the
      17 demands formulated by the Central Committee of the Communist League in
      March 1848, that is in the already begun revolution, and moreover m the
      well known circular of the Central Committee of March 1850, hence <I>after
      </I>the defeat of the German revolution, in the midst of the high tide of
      the reaction, in the expectation of a new upturn of the revolution</P>
    
    <P>This circular said that, of course, at the start of the movement, the
      workers could not yet propose any directly communist measures, but they
      could compel the Democrats to intervene in as many sides of the hitherto
      existing social order as possible, to disturb its regular functioning and
      to compromise themselves, as well as to concentrate as many productive
      forces, means of transport, railways, etc., as possible in the hands of
      the state.</P>
    
    <P>In this case, Marx, or the Central Committee, have in mind the
      transition from the bourgeois to the proletarian revolution and, at the
      same time, the of the workers fighting for power.</P>
    
    <P>It is obvious that the transitional slogans formulated here are not
      relevant for Germany today, where the bourgeois revolution lies behind us
      (even if it has still left a vast quantity of rubbish, like the separate
      states, the legal system amalgamated with elements left over from princely
      absolutisn, etc.) and which faces the proletarian or socialist revolution
      as the next direct link.</P>
    
    <P>Here the question for us was only one of characterising the general
      nature of 'transitional slogans' in the stage of the working class
      struggle for power, as opposed to transitional <I>measures </I>in the
      sense of the <I>Communist Manifesto, </I>which are, in truth, maximum
      demands. But the comrades who look here for an incomprehensible
      theoretical error of mine commit one themselves, as they <I>confuse </I>different
      things.</P>
    
    <P>Firstly, transitional slogans and transitional measures in the sense of
      the <I>Communist Manifesto, </I>that is, maximum slogans. Secondly,
      transitional slogans that are effective, transform themselves into action,
      in an immediate revolutionary situation, that is, in the <I>course </I>of
      the working-class struggle for power. Transitional slogans in our sense
      were posed and propagated by Marx and Engels only at the emergence of the
      revolutionary situation, at the outbreak of the revolution, then (1850)
      also in a time of profound reaction, the ebb of the revolution.</P>
    
    <P>The situation will be fully clarified if one considers the situation in
      which the 1850 circular of the Central Committee was drafted. It was a
      period 'between two revolutions'. The revolution had, for the time being,
      been defeated. Reaction ruled. Marx and Engels expected a new
      revolutionary upswing in connection with a new economic crisis, but this
      new revolutionary upturn <I>had not yet arrived. </I>The members of the
      Communist League are, of course, not meant to put the transitional slogans
      from the circular m their pockets until the appearance of the new
      revolutionary outbreak, but they should already now, before the outbreak,
      propagate them within the working class. The circular serves not only to
      develop the perspectives of the new revolutionary struggles for the
      members, to show them the basic lines of strategy and tactics, but also to
      nourish the present <I>propaganda of </I>the Communists in the working
      class. Through this propaganda the Communists shall prepare the working
      class for the coming revolutionary struggles. To start with propaganda for
      the struggle for power when it has already begun is typical chvostism
      (tail-endism). This was typical of the liquidatory Mensheviks and Trotsky
      in the years of reaction in Russia after 1907. The liquidators wanted
      those key slogans to be posed which presupposed a Tsarist regime with
      liberal additions. As the most important one they raised the freedom of
      combination In opposition to them Lenin represented the viewpoint that a
      second revolution would be necessary, and that accordingly one should
      raise the unabridged revolutionary slogans: the well-known three whales -
      democratic republic, eight-hour day, landlord's land to the peasants. The
      Leninist slogans were presented in the big mass strikes of 1912.</P>
    
    <P>I assumed that these simple things would be well known. That was
      evidently a mistake.</P>
    
    <P>Now we go to the twentieth century</P>
    
    <P>Lenin deals with the question of transitional demands in his text on the
      'Infantile Disorders of Leftism', where he speaks of the still not fully
      Communist slogans or measures which are necessary to draw the majority of
      the proletariat and working people close to the (already convinced)
      revolutionary vanguard. That was written in 1920. Lenin was careful and
      prudent enough not to put any time limit on when the majority of the
      working class and working people had or ought to be drawn around the
      vanguard. In any case, it is clear that for Lenin the transitional slogans
      ought to be propagated at a time when the Communist Party has not yet won
      the majority of the working class and the working people, in a generally
      revolutionary but not yet acutely revolutionary situation.</P>
    
    <P>The issue will become clearer when we consider the Third Congress of the
      CI.</P>
    
    <P>Let us look at Radek's report on tactics. Of course, what Radek
      expressed here was not his personal view, but that of the leading Russian
      comrades, above all that of Lenin</P>
    
    <P>On transitional slogans, the following <I>general </I>viewpoints were
      developed:</P>
    
    <P>The minimum demands in the programme of pre-war Social Democracy were 'a
      system of demands which should improve the situation of the working class
      on the basis of capitalism, which should arm the working class against the
      depressing tendencies of capitalism. Rosa Luxemburg once characterised the
      real function of the Social Democratic (minimum) programme, in a polemic
      with Sombart, in such a way that she declared: 'Really we only struggle
      for the commodity labour power to be sold at its real price, so that the
      worker receives the wage which allows him to reproduce his own labour
      power.'</P>
    
    <P>The Social Democratic <I>minimum programme </I>remained <I>economically
      </I>within the framework of the capitalist economic form, practically
      within the framework of the bourgeois-democratic state, the 'well known
      democratic litany', as Marx put it in his remarks on the Gotha Programme.
      The objective precondition for it was that the Social Democracy still
      envisaged 'a long period of existence of capitalist society'.</P>
    
    <P>The minimum programme of the pre-war Social Democracy posed demands
      'which were attainable within capitalist society, and which functioned in
      a revolutionary way, since capitalist society time and again, opposed
      these attainable and, for the working class, necessary demands'.</P>
    
    <P>Here one should have added that the revolutionary <I>effect </I>of the
      political minimum demands, for example, in the Erfurt Programme, was
      connected to the fact that here, in the political area, the bourgeois
      revolution had been stuck in mid-course. In Bismarck-Hohenzollern Germany,
      the bourgeois-parliamentary republic slogan must, naturally, have a
      revolutionary effect. As is known, it was not contained in the Erfurt
      Programme, allegedly purely for police reasons. In reality, there was more
      to it, as was demonstrated by the opposition to the proposal by Rosa
      Luxemburg to propagate the republic (1910), and later (1918) by the Social
      Democratic attempts, even in the last hours, to save the monarchy. At the
      foundation congress of the KPD (Spartakusbund), in late December 19 18,
      Rosa Luxemburg declared: 'For us now there is no minimum programme, no
      maximum programme; socialism is one and the same, that is the minimum we
      have to achieve today.'</P>
    
    <P>In the Spartacus programme, this minimum and maximum was posed as: 'all
      power to the worker councils, arming of the proletariat, cancellation of
      state debts, seizing possession of the factories', etc.</P>
    
    <P>'In which situation', commented Radek, 'did this programme arise? The
      workers' councils were the highest power in Germany. Formally, the working
      class., had the power in its hands. And the task of the Spartacus League
      consisted in just saying to these workers' councils what the power of the
      working class consists of, and nothing more.'</P>
    
    <P>'It is clear', continued Radek, 'that now we do not find ourselves in
      this situation. The bourgeoisie has the power. The first working-class
      assault in the epoch of demobilisation was repelled. The proletarian
      revolution is now only growing.'</P>
    
    <P>What is the consequence?</P>
    
    <P>'Primarily, it is this: one must try to lead all struggle over wage
      rises, over working hours, against unemployment towards the intermediate
      aim of control over production, not towards the system of production,
      control effected by the government, by passing a law, which the
      proletariat has then to respect, that the worker does not steal, and the
      capitalist has to watch that the worker works. Control over production
      means education in proletarian struggle, all factory organisations to be
      subject to elections, their local and district-wide connection on the
      basis of industrial groups in the proletarian struggle.'</P>
    
    <P>Radek named 'the arming of the proletariat, the disarming of the
      bourgeoisie' as the second slogan.</P>
    
    <P>And he draws the following <I>general conclusion:</I></P>
    
    <P>'One could mention even more slogans of that type. I will not do so.
      They grow out of the practical struggle. What we say to you, give to you
      as a general slogan, as a general orientation is, not to counterpose
      yourselves to the proletariat in all the struggles Which the masses
      undertake, but to sharpen, to extend the struggles of the masses for their
      practical necessities, and to teach them to have greater necessities: the
      necessity to conquer power.'</P>
    
    <P>I mention one more passage from the report:</P>
    
    <P>The preparatory work is not in opposition to the epoch of agitation...
      struggle is revolutionary agitation, struggle is revolutionary propaganda,
      struggle is illegal organisations, the military training of the
      proletariat, party school, demonstration, uprising, is struggle.'</P>
    
    <P>The Third Congress Theses on Tactics sum up the ideas in the report then
      as follows:</P>
    
    <P>'The action tasks which will soon confront the VKPI) [United Communist
      Party of Germany - the name initially adopted by the KPI) after the fusion
      of the KPD (Spartakusbund) with the left of the Independent Social
      Democratic Party], because of the breakdown of the German economy and the
      capitalist threat to the living standards of the working masses, can only
      be accomplished if the party, instead of opposing the tasks of
      organisation and agitation to those of action, of the deed, keeps
      constantly on the alert the spirit of militancy in its organisations,
      makes its agitation really popular in character, and builds its
      organisations in such a way that through its ties with the masses, it
      develops the ability to weigh up situations most carefiffly, to determine
      the moment for fighting, and to prepare thoroughly for the fight.' <I>(Thesen
      und Resolutionen des 3. Weltkongresses der Kommunistischen Internationale</I>,
      Hamburg 1921, part 4, pp.43-44.)</P>
    
    <P>'The Communist Parties do not put forward any <I>minimum programme </I>to
      strengthen and improve the tottering structure of capitalism The
      destruction of that structure remains their guiding aim and their
      immediate mission. But to carry out this mission the Communist Parties
      must put forward demands whose fulfilment is an immediate and urgent
      working-class need, and they must fight for these demands in mass
      struggle, regardless of whether or not they are compatible with the profit
      economy of the capitalist class or not-</P>
    
    <P>'It is not the viability and competitive capacity of capitalist
      industry, nor the profitability of capitalist finance to which Communist
      Parties should pay regard, but the limits of want which the proletariat
      cannot and should not endure any longer. If the demands correspond to the
      vital need of broad proletarian masses, if these masses feel that they
      cannot exist unless these demands are met, then the struggles for these
      demands will become the starting points of the struggle for power In place
      of the minimum programme of the reformists and centrists, the Communist
      International puts the struggle for the concrete needs of the proletariat,
      for a system of demands which in their totality disintegrate the power of
      the bourgeoisie, organise the proletariat, represent stages in the
      struggle for the proletarian dictatorship, and each of which expresses in
      itself the need of the broadest masses, even if the masses themselves are
      not yet consciously in favour of the proletarian dictatorship.' <I>(Thesen
      und Resolutionen</I>, part 5, pp.46-7.)</P>
    
    <P>1... To the extent that the struggles for partial demands, and the
      particular struggles of particular groups of workers develop into the
      general struggle of the working class against capitalism, the Communist
      Party must also <I>intensify </I>and generalise its slogans, up to the
      slogan of the direct defeat of the enemy In formulating their partial
      demands, the Communist Parties have to consider that these demands -
      anchored in the needs of the broadest masses - not only lead the masses in
      the struggle, but by their very nature also are organising demands. Every
      practical slogan which derives from the economic needs of the working
      masses must be channelled into the struggle for the control of production,
      not as a plan for the bureaucratic organisation of the national economy
      under the capitalist regime, but as the struggle against capitalism,
      through the factory councils and revolutionary trade unions.' (Ibid.,
      pp.47-8.)</P>
    
    <P>Between the <I>beginning </I>of the struggle for power by the working
      class and the classes allied to it, the outbreak of the acute
      revolutionary period and its provisional closure at the conquest of power
      by the establishment of the council-power (provisional closure, since
      after the establishment of the council-power, the struggle continues for
      its maintenance), lies the period <I>of the struggle </I>for power
      itself. Many comrades 'forget' that. In Russia in 1917, the struggle of
      the working class for power lasted from March to October - eight months.
      Its starting point was the 'dual-government', the coexistence of the
      bourgeois-democratic state power (Kerensky government) and the workers',
      peasants' and soldiers' councils, the latter of which realised in an
      original form the workers' and peasants' democratic dictatorship. Its <I>end-point
      </I>was the establishment of the soviet power in October, the destruction
      and removal of the bourgeois-democratic state power and state machine.</P>
    
    <P>The main contents of the resolution are as follows:</P>
    
    <P>(1) The rise of the councils of workers', peasants' and soldiers'
      deputies as organs of struggle of the revolutionary classes, their
      struggle with the organs of bourgeois democracy and finally their victory
      over them, which transforms the councils into the organs of <I>the </I>proletarian
      state power.</P>
    
    <P>(2) The aiming and the armed struggles of the workers, peasants and
      soldiers, the undermining and destruction of the Tsarist army, finally the
      armed uprising, the victory of the armed workers, peasants and the
      creation of the Red Guards and the Red Army.</P>
    
    <P>(3) The sporadic workers' control of production, where the employers are
      still formally owners of the factories, but the control and, in part,
      management is subordinate to the factory councils. The end-point is, with
      the conquest of power, the seizure of the big enterprises by the
      council-state, their management by the organs of the workers' state,
      simultaneously, systematic extension of workers' control which, however,
      now assumes a wholly different character, where the employer is now
      replaced as owner and manager by the workers' state. Workers' control is
      integrated by, and subordinate to, the council-state leadership,
      generalised and transformed.</P>
    
    <P>(4) The local, spontaneous and direct occupation of the land of the big
      landlords by the peasants. The end-point here is: the decree nationalising
      the land, the <I>general </I>confiscation of large-scale landed property
      by the state.</P>
    
    <P>These eight months also constitute the transition or the change from the
      bourgeois-democratic into the proletarian-socialist revolution.</P>
    
    <P>There is no doubt that Marx and Engels had in mind not only transitional
      measures <I>after </I>the conquest of power, after the establishment of
      the workers' and peasants' democratic dictatorship (as stated in the <I>Communist
      Manifesto), </I>but also transitional slogans for the preceding period,
      for the conquest of power itself (Engels 1847, the 17 denmds of March
      1848, the Central Committee circular of 1850).</P>
    
    <P>This was a transition from the bourgeois-democratic to the
      proletarian-socialist revolution also under the conditions prevailing at
      the time in Germany. In <I>present-day </I>Germany, which has left the
      completed bourgeois-democratic revolution behind, the section of the
      struggle of the workers, and of those classes allied to and led by them,
      for state power cannot any longer, of course, be a transition from the
      bourgeois democratic to the proletarian-socialist revolution. In Germany,
      the different stages of the bourgeois and proletarian revolution, which
      were compressed into the space of time from 1905/06 to 1917 in Russia,
      that is12 years, are separated by over 70 years (the bourgeois revolution
      in Germany began in 1848, and is concluded in 1919; simultaneously, the
      proletarian revolution <I>began</I> in 1918).</P>
    
    <P>One thing is certain, the struggle of the working class and its allies
      for power, in Germany and also in other counties with similar economic and
      administrative preconditions, will last for a determined period, not just
      a fleeting moment As its main contents one can already today indicate an
      outline as follows:</P>
    
    <P>1) The formation of workers' (small peasants' and possibly soldiers')
      councils as organs of struggle, their struggle against the organs of the
      bourgeois state power.</P>
    
    <P>2) The arming and armed struggles of the workers, the undermining and
      finally the smashing of the bourgeois military and police power, and other
      military forces of the bourgeoisie.</P>
    
    <P>3) The conquest of new positions of power by the workers against the
      employers in the factories, the control and partial management of
      individual factories by the workers; in probability, also already the
      partial expulsion or flight of capitalist employers from 'their'
      enterprises.</P>
    
    <P>4) Probably also the local occupation of large scale landed property,
      big farm land, by farm labourers, rural semi-proletarians, dwarf- and
      small-holders and lower layers of the middle peasantry.</P>
    
    <P>What kind of slogans?</P>
    
    <P>If we take as an example the slogan of the local occupation of
      large-scale landed property and the land of large farmers by farm
      labourers, rural casual labourers, dwarf- and small-holders and part of
      the middle peasantry. Is that a partial slogan? Surely not. It is more. It
      already breaks the framework of the bourgeois order. Is it a <I>maximum
      </I>slogan? Not yet. It is less. A maximum slogan is the expropriation of
      the big landlords (and big farmers) and the appropriation of the land by
      the council state.</P>
    
    <P>What we have here is a type of transitional slogan. There will be quite
      a few of them. Some can be foreseen, others cannot.</P>
    
    <P>A second example - the slogan of the councils. They will arise in acute
      revolutionary situations. For a longer or shorter period they become
      organs of struggle of the working class and its allies, rather than organs
      <I>of power. </I>The maximum slogan is that of council power: 'All power
      to the councils!' But what is the 'Workers' and Peasants' Government!'
      slogan? It is surely not a bourgeois-democratic slogan. It already breaks
      the framework of the bourgeois state. Hence it is not a partial, reform or
      minimum slogan. It is a revolutionary slogan. Is it already a maximum
      slogan, the ready-made council-power, its 'synonym or pseudonym'? Two
      names or slogans for the same thing are superfluous. It is again a
      transitional slogan for the struggle for power: the council-power of the
      council state in its not yet perfect or finished, but still
      incomplete and transitory, form. (For example, in Russia, from 7 November
      up to the breaking-up of the alliance with the Left SRs in the soviets.)</P>
    
    <P>This is also a type of transitional slogan, and as a condition a
      transitional one or a transitional measure in the here-mentioned
      sense.</P>
    
    <P>Moreover, one must see that this period of struggle must be prepared
      <I>agitationally, propagandistically, organisationally, </I>that is, that
      the transitional slogans must be propagated before the struggle for power
      has begun, until and so that they become <I>slogans of action </I>in the
      struggle for powert</P>
    
    <P>When and <I>which </I>specific transitional slogans are agitated for
      and propagated before the immediate struggle for power, depends on the
      concrete conditions, but must be investigated in each single case. In
      other words, that is the task of <I>leading </I>the masses to the
      struggle for power.</P>
    
    <P>This task, which Lenin saw as the main task of the Communist Party in
      the most important countries in 1920, at a time when capitalism was much
      more convulsed than today, seemed attainable in a relatively short time.
      Today the objective circumstances indicate that it will necessitate a <I>longer
      time.</I></P>
    
    <P>But the <I>essence of this task </I>remains the same today as it did
      then.</P>
    
    <P>To want to <I>overlook </I>or <I>forget' </I>or argue away this task
      is to commit a great theoretical as well as a practical error. It means
      ignoring the <I>subjective </I>conditions necessary for the realisation
      of the transitional slogans. It means to forget the role of the Communist
      Party as the leader of the working class, which has to show it the next
      step. It means to limit oneself to 'tail-ending', to remaining behind the
      movement of the masses. It is Kautsky's famous strategy of attrition.</P>
    
    <P>The general result is this:</P>
    
    <P>1) A limiting to a minimum programme, like that of the pre-war Social
      Democracy, which holds itself within the framework of the capitalist order
      and the bourgeois-democratic state, is not permissible in a time when
      capitalism finds itself in a revolutionary crisis and where the
      bourgeois-democratic state already exists in fact in the country in
      question.</P>
    
    <P>2) Just as impermissible is limiting oneself to maximum slogans, in a
      time when capitalism finds itself indeed in revolutionary crisis, but the
      working class is not immediately fighting for power and the bourgeoisie
      has again consolidated itself in power for a longer of a shorter time.</P>
    
    <P>3) In a period like that the task is, apart from propagating maximum
      slogans: agitation, propaganda and organisation of struggles around
      partial demands and transitional slogans.</P>
    
    <P>The posing of the one or the other must conform to the concrete
      circumstances of the struggle.</P>
    
    <P>Where do we find ourselves now? Not in the first period of struggle of
      the still unshaken capitalism. The draft programme is absolutely correct
      to speak of the general crisis <I>of </I>capitalism, which denotes the
      whole actual period of struggle. Even if the particular postiwar crisis
      has been overcome, the general crisis <I>of </I>capitalism has in any
      case remained. This crisis is already proved by the fact that the Soviet
      Union, an oasis with a dominating socialist economic form, exists and
      grows in the middle of the capitalist world.</P>
    
    <P>Is world capitalism in 1928 different from that of 1921, that of the
      Third Congress? Certainly. Capitalism has, in the meantime, consolidated
      itself more firmly (but so have the Soviet Union and the Communist
      International).</P>
    
    <P>But is the situation different in its fundamental characteristics, which
      determine the posing and propagating of transitional slogans? No!</P>
    
    <P>Hence what follows?</P>
    
    <P>Two things:</P>
    
    <P>1) The continuing general crisis of capitalism proves today as in 1921
      the necessity of posing and propagating transitional slogans.</P>
    
    <P>2) The overcoming of the particular post-war crisis of capitalism, the
      'relative stabilisation of capitalism', the development of contradictions,
      crises, conflicts on new bases, stipulates that the transitional slogans
      are adapted to a new situation, given new contents and forms, that their
      utilisation will have different forms, etc. It is not simply a question of
      repeating the old formulas and forms.</P>
    
    <P>I content myself here with this general result. To deal with <I>one
      </I>of these transitional slogans, such as that of control of production,
      its actual possible content in a country like Germany or Italy, its form
      of propagation adapted to the situation, the organisational utilisation,
      etc., would go too far here.</P>
    
    <P>The programme must give clear information over the question: what are
      transitional slogans, under what conditions should they be propagated,
      when do they become slogans of action, etc.</P>
    
    <P>The questions are thrown up in the movement; they must be clearly and
      precisely replied to, in a general form, in the programme. </P>
