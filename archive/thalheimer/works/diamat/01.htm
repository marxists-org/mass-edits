<H3>1 - Religion I</H3>


<p>Our topic is the &quot;modern world-view.&quot; Immediately this
question arises: Is there a uniform modern world-view accepted by everyone, in
the sense that there is a uniform physics or chemistry? Physics and chemistry
are unquestionably uniform systems which one can expound in the same way all
over the world. Of course, in these sciences, too, there are moot questions,
but these moot questions remain within the bounds of the science. They only
arise upon a common basis of accepted scientific achievement. And they are
settled by methods which are accepted by all concerned - that is, by
experiments. This is true of such problems as arise in physics, those, for
example, in relation to the theory of relativity. Thus there is the important
and very much discussed question whether there is an ether, a material medium
of light. Now in physics we answer such questions by experiments, and this
problem was actually tackled by a series of experiments by famous physicists,
particularly by the American physicist, Michelson. Then there are a whole
series of other problems which arise in this connection, such as the question
of apparent irregularities in the orbit of the planet Mercury, the question of
the path of a ray of light which passes close to the sun, etc. For all these
questions in physics there is a uniform method of research, a uniform solution.
The same is true of problems in chemistry. Recently, for example, the question
arose whether it was possible to change lead or quicksilver into gold. Several
investigators maintained that it could be done, but it was demonstrated through
more exact experiments that <i>for the present </i>
it cannot be
done. Or other problems of chemistry: the problem of the composition of the
ultimate chemical elements&#8212;atoms. Here too experiment has led to further
disclosures and to uniform solutions. Atoms have been finally analyzed into
smaller elements. Therefore, all things considered, we can say that there are a
number of sciences which are uniform, which one can uniformly cxpound, and
which are determined by uniform methods.</p>



<p>The case is quite different with questions of world-view. There is no
uniform, universally accepted, modern world-view - as there is a uniform
physics or a uniform chemistry or botany. There are, as we know, wholly opposed
world-views which wage violent war on each other, which do not accept each
other's methods. What is true for one philosophy is false for the others, what
is false for one is true for the others. For instance, I am a Communist and as a
Communist represent a very definite viewpoint, namely, historical or
dialectical materialism. But this world-view co-exists with others opposing it
which also call themselves &quot;modern&quot; and which wage violent
war on dialectical materialism, while at the same time dialectical materialism
wages violent war on them. Moreover, there is a further consideration: You see
on the one hand that this theory of historical materialism is uniform. Wherever
it is presented, it is presented in the same manner. When a dialectical
materialist deals with certain questions, he treats them in the same way as
another dialectical materialist; one more skillfully, the other less
skillfully; one with more, the other with less knowledge of the facts. But the
method is one and same.</p>



<p>But consider on the other hand the world-views which stand opposed to
historical materialism. Here are a whole host of different viewpoints on nature
and on history. To begin with, there are a great number of
world-views which we call religion. Religion is a definite world-view. As you know, there is not one but a great number of religions each of which maintains
that it alone is right and that all others are wrong, and that 
letter-spacing:
it alone points out to men the right path in life and the way to a happy
life after death, that it alone delivers men from all evil and suffering.
Besides these different religions there are various other world-views of a
philosophical nature. Such conceptions are well-nigh as numerous as professors
of philosophy. There are a whole host of schools of philosophy in America and
Europe, and, depending upon where you go, you will be told that one or another
is <i>
the </i>
philosophy. Here
the case is the same as with religions: each maintains that it alone is right
and that all the others are wrong. Such world-views occur in great number not
only in America and Europe; as you know, there are also in China a whole host
of philosophic systems which war with each other, which compete with each other
for your attention. The question therefore arises: How shall we correctly
orient ourselves in this difficult situation? How shall we solve the problem of
describing the modern world-view without causing a hullaballoo in our minds?</p>



<p>Since I accept a definite modern world-view, dialectical materialism,
the impression might be received that this will be a one-sided report. Perhaps
someone might propose that we seek to get a cross-section of all the different
viewpoints and possibly find therein what is common to all and present it as
&quot;the modern world-view.&quot; But these viewpoints so contradict each
other, they set out from such different premises and employ methods so
different that if I contrived to put them all together into one lump and then
pared away the contradictions there would be nothing left. The problem becomes
all the more difficult since you who read these lectures are not possessed of
blank minds. Rather, each one of you already holds to this or that
world-view more or less clearly, either as a result of inculcated religious attitudes
or as a result of other environmental influences - language, lectures, books,
etc. Thus I cannot assume that you will receive what I shall say about modern
world-views without prejudice. Consequently, I shall approach the problem in
the following manner: I shall present dialectical materialism as the most
advanced modern world-view, yet not simply as something ready-made, but in <i> its historical setting, </i>
in its
development. I shall therefore try to show how and from what sources historical
materialism came into being. Secondly, from the standpoint of historical
materialism, I shall try, together with you, to come to an understanding of the
most important and influential world-views in Europe, America and China which
co-exist with historical materialism, so that we may confute or even accept
them, supplement or improve them. I choose this type of presentation to help
you arrive at an independent orientation, and to help you find your way among
the various intellectual currents which will sooner or later confront you. I consider
best the method used by the famous German philosopher, Kant. He used to say to
his listeners: I do not want to teach you philosophy - that is, a hard and fast
doctrine - but I wish to teach you how man philosophizes, how man orients
himself in relation to nature and history. It is the same with philosophy as
with a craft, shoemaking, let us say. If I discuss shoemaking, it will be of
little value if I do not show how the thing is practically handled. Likewise,
you will gain little if I speak at great length on dialectical materialism but
fail to point out how man applies this world-view to the fundamental problems
of social theory, history, natural science, epistemology, etc., so that he may
consistently elaborate and solve them.</p>



<p>Therefore, in my presentation of historical or dialectical materialism
I shall apply the method of historical materialism itself. Through this
procedure you will become acquainted with two special characteristics of
dialectical materialism at the same time: I present dialectical materialism
itself as something which comes into being, that is, as something historical.
It is a peculiar quality of historical materialism that it views all things in
both natural and human worlds nor as completed, not as finished once and for
all, but as emerging, continually changing, and ultimately disappearing. And
secondly, when I show you how historical materialism emerged from a world-view
or from various world-views which were directly opposed to it, you will see
here a special kind of dialectical materialism: you will perceive that development
comes about through contradictions, that a thing always develops out of its
opposite. This proposition demands detailed clarification and foundation,
which it will receive later. What obtains for all things also obtains for
historical materialism itself, and this we shall have to show. When we consider
at closer range the different world-views which today stand opposed to each
other, we can distinguish beneath apparent confusion very definite groupings,
very definite categories. When we examine them from this point of view, we find
two <i>
fundamental
tendencies. </i> These two tendencies of the modern world-view
are in close correspondence with the underlying class division which is
characteristic of modern capitalistic society. Just as the working class and
the bourgeoisie stand opposed to each other, so we see that the modern
world-views are grouped in accordance with these two fundamental tendencies.
One tendency is the proletarian. To it belongs historical or dialectical
materialism, otherwise known as Marxism. The other is the bourgeois tendency,
whichis represented by the different forms of the so-called idealistic
world-view. These two fundamental tendencies are as definitive of the
world-views as difference between the two classes is definitive of social life
and economics. In addition, there is still a third tendency, which stands
apparently between the two,
between the proletarian and the bourgeois, and which fancies itself as standing
<i>above </i>the other two tendencies, but
which is really only a special form of the bourgeois outlook. This type of
world-view corresponds to that class which stands between the proletariat and
the bourgeoisie, namely, the petty bourgeoisie. Just as the petty bourgeoisie
stands socially between proletariat and bourgeoisie, so there is a series of
world-views which stand between the materialist tendency of the proletariat
and the idealist tendency of the bourgeoisie. But just as the petty bourgeoisie
cannot in actuality assume a neutral, intermediate position between proletariat
and bourgeoisie, but must decide in favor of one or the other class, and must
form an alliance with one or with the other, so the world-views of the petty
bourgeoisie cannot stand above or between materialism and idealism. All of
these viewpoints are actually varieties of the idealistic or bourgeois
tendency.</p>



<p>In what follows I shall try to present these fundamental tendencies in
their historical development. Accordingly, we need not treat them in very
great detail, listing many names, dates, etc.; but we need only make the basic
concepts as clear and distinct as possible. From the standpoint of China, only
the great lines of European cultural history are of importance. I want to tell
you briefly what I shall mainly deal with as regards the prehistory and later
development of historical materialism, and the views opposed to it. Of course,
dialectical materialism itself will be the focal point. First, 1 shall deal
with the question of religion as the oldest and fundamental conception, from
which all the others have emerged. Then I shall deal with the most important
world-views as they were developed in antiquity, in ancient Greece, in India,
and in China - again not in detail, but only in broad and general outline. Then
I shall enter upon a treatment of French materialism, that is, that world-view
which prepared the way for the greatest and most significant bourgeois
revolution at the end of the eighteenth century. I shall treat French materialism
separately because of its essential contribution to the development of
historical materialism. Then I shall present the most important stages in the
development of classical bourgeois philosophy in Germany: Hegel and Feuerbach.
I single out these two because, like the French materialists, they made a
surpassing contribution to the building of the modern dialectical viewpoint.
Finally, when we have viewed the history of dialectical materialism in its
principal phases, we shall seek to orient ourselves in relation to the most
important intellectual currents of the present day in America, in Europe, and
in China.</p>




<p>We may now turn immediately to our
first topic, a consideration of religions. We begin with religion because
religion, as you know, is the oldest of all world-views.
I shall not deal with the different forms of religion in different countries
and ages. That would have no value for us. Rather, I am going to deal only with
that which is universal and fundamental in religion. I shall take up the question
in what fundamental way it differs from the modern world-view, how religion
emerges, what material bases it has, how religion becomes separated from
science and finally disintegrates, and what particular stand Communism takes on
the question of religion.</p>





<p>The first question: What distinguishes religion from the modern,
scientific dialectical-materialistic world-view? What is the peculiar,
essential characteristic of religion? The essential characteristic of religion
I can designate thus: Religion is the product of fantasy, of the imagination,
as opposed to the modern world-view which is a product of science. Or it may
also be contrasted thus: Religion is rooted in belief, science in knowledge.
But it is not true that religion, as opposed to science, is solely a product of
free fantasy, that it comes into being without previous experience. The case is
just the same with religious fantasy as it is with every other fantasy. Every
fantasy, all poetry, has a distinct empirical basis which is elaborated in a
fantastic way. Science likewise has its empirical basis, but it elaborates it
in a manner diametrically opposite to religion; not through fantasy, but
through logic, through research and through reason.</p>





<p>In order to present this contrast as simply as possible, I want to
give you an example of how one and the same event is treated by religion and by
science. Let us take a phenomenon like rain. Rain is a phenomenon of
extraordinary importance to the material life of mankind. Among peoples whose
principal occupation is agriculture the fate of the population is in large
measure dependent upon the frequency, quantity, and local distribution of
rain. But rain is a phenomenon which lies outside man's control. Man cannot
cause it to come and go as he pleases. What, then, does religion do? What do
primitive peoples do? They represent the natural phenomenon of rain as the product
of a fantastic being, of a god of rain. Such rain-gods are found among
primitive folk in highly varying forms. The problem then is to influence these
lords of rain by those methods known through experience to exert an influence on mighty beings. These are gifts
(sacrifices), supplications (prayers), threats or symbolic acts which are
supposed to represent real acts (ceremonies). Among some peoples we find 
<p>specialists for this purpose, so-called
rain-makers, who believe that they can conjure up rain through ceremonies,
incantations, etc.</p>





<p>Science views rain quite differently. It considers it not as the
product of a god, spirit, or demon, but as the product of natural causes, of
given natural forces. It seeks the causes of rain not in the arbitrary will of 
fantastic beings which are supposed to be hidden
behind the phenomenon, but in the phenomenon itself and in its relation to the
general organization of nature. Thus there is a special science, meteorology,
which deals with rain, observes its manifestations, and arranges these
observations with special reference to the question: What is the cause and what
is the effect? Under what conditions does rain fail to appear, in what regions
does it appear, etc.? We are not yet so far advanced in the science that we can
always predict exactly the occurrence of rain, nor can we produce it at will.
Thus an Australian rain-magician is apparently much farther advanced than a
modern student of meteorology, who predicts rain more or less exactly, but
cannot produce it. You see here the fundamental contrast between the method of
religion and that of science. A second, very well-known example: the remarkable
phenomenon of thunder, on which everyone reflects. The religious person
conceives that there is a god of thunder who travels over the clouds in a
chariot or who brings forth the tumult with an instrument. He has various
magical means by which he believes he can make thunder.</p>



<p>Science, as we know, treats thunder very differently, namely, as a
noise which is bound up with the occurrence of an electric discharge,
lightning. We are not yet so far advanced that we can actually bring forth
thunder and lightning on a large scale. But on asmall scale, in the laboratory, we can already produce events
identical with thunder and lightning.</p>





<p>To sum up what we have learned from these examples: the peculiar
characteristic of religion is that it fantastically elaborates a certain cycle
of experiences, he they in nature or in history, and in such fashion that
gods, spirits or demons are represented as the producers, lords or masters of
natural phenomena. In the most developed forms of religion there are not many
spirits, gods or demons, but only one god who is the supreme ruler of nature, a
fantastic being who is supposed to sit above and beyond the world, whose nature
can he recognized as the projection of man himself, whose capacities are
fantastically elevated, and who has these capacities without a body
appertaining. Perhaps we should not say that there is one god, but rather that
there is a ruling family: the father, the son, and the holy ghost, who together
rule the world. From the elementary form which this assumes with the
Australian Negro to the form which it takes in the Christian religion there is
a long chain of development, but in fundamental principle it is the same
throughout. Today under modern capitalism there are, to be sure,
extraordinarily refined forms in which the religious idea is far removed from
the primitive conception of rain-god held by the Australian Negro. If eve
probe deeply, however, we discover that these very refined conceptions hark
back to the mystical beings of primitive people, who arbitrarily control events.</p>



<p>Quite different is the method of science. What does science do? It
observes and collects facts; it arranges them in groups, classes, etc.; it
analyzes them, seeks rules as to how the consequences derive from the precedent
facts, how concomitants mutually affect each other, how the facts occurred. It
investigates - and this is very important - how social forms come into being
and how they change; and moreover, on the basis of natural science it builds
technology, and on the basis of social science, politics. Thus, in accordance
with known laws, it places the forces of nature at the service of human ends,
at the service of the establishment of use-values, or social institutions. In
this respect religion, no matter what name it may bear, fundamentally differs
from modern science, from the modern world-view.</p>





<p>I proceed now to my next topic, namely, to the question: &quot;What
are the main sources of religious conceptions?&quot; We can distinguish two
main sources from which religious conceptions flow. The first source is the
relation of man to nature - his dependence, in fact, upon nature and his desire
to master in fantasy the forces of nature which he cannot master in reality, by
offering sacrifices, praying, performing ceremonies, etc. The second and no
less important source from which religious conceptions and religious fantasies
flow are the relations of individual men to
society; that is to say, the totality
of social relations. Now, the basis of social relations in turn is the mode of
production, i.e. the relationships into
which men enter with each other while
producing, with certain instruments, useful things for the maintenance of life;
or the social way in which they produce their material livelihood.</p>


<p>We shall now consider these two sources
of religion, first of all in the most primitive social
forms. As for dependence upon nature: it is clear that the less developed men
are - technically and economically - so much more dependent are they upon
nature, and they aye more inclined to view all natural phenomena through the
eyes of religious fantasy. If you consider primitive man, armed with only the
most elementary implements of stone, bone, or wood, scarcely able to sustain
life by hunting, fishing, etc., it is clear that from such relations of
dependence upon nature the most varied religious ideas must develop. Or take
the primitive farmer: he is extremely dependent upon the forces of nature, on
the sun, the wind, the rain, on the river which flows past his land. As long as
man is style='letter-spacing:.2pt'>unable to supervise all these
relations, to foresee them, and conquer them technically to a certain
degree, he will seek mastery over these things through religious Ideas. In this
connection I want to remind you of the distinctive characteristics of the ancient
religion of China, which naturally is a religion of farmers; in it <p>the
forces of nature which are most important for the farmer, such as rain, the
heavens, the stars, etc., play a decisive role in the religious idea. If you
consider the different social forms and their religions you will find that
they always stand in exceedingly close connection with the way in which such a
society stands in relation to nature. I do not wish to go into any further
detail on this question, but simply to indicate the general aspect of the
matter.</p>





<p>The second source from which the religious idea flows is the social
relations of men with each other. These social relations show that the
individual man in society is dependent upon the whole, that over against him a
higher power is placed. In early times the society as a whole exercised a very
powerful influence upon the individual, and the subordination of the individual
to the family and to the tribe was extraordinarily great. For the individual,
morals, laws, customs, usages and precepts of universal scope had the force of
imperative commands. But their meaning and purpose were not generally, not even
in the majority of instances, clear to the individual or understood by him.
Conformity was instinctive, automatic. Primitive society was itself still a
kind of natural organism. Its codes, precepts, customs, etc., affected individuals
just like the uncomprehended forces of nature. Indeed, primitive social
organizations in general reacted to their own regulations as they did to theseinmutable forces of nature. And from this
characteristic of social organization there naturally arose the religious idea
as its <i>support </i>and <i>sanction. </i>For example: everywhere in the
South Seas we have the so-called tabu-commandments, that is, commandments which
declare that such and such groups of men must not hunt and eat such and such
animals at certain times, or not collect and eat certain plants. Such commandments
once had a distinct significance. They were equivalent to the regulation of
production; they effected a kind of division of labor and a kind of regulation
of consumption. But these commandments later became obscure, became automatic.
From them certain religious commandments developed to the effect that such and
such spirits, demons, etc., had issued such and such commandments and would see
to their observance by threat of punishment.</p>





<p>Still another example that comes very close to home: one of the
oldest, perhaps the oldest religious idea is that of reverence for the souls of
the dead, the spirits of the ancestors. Even in the most primitive religious
ideas this plays a very important role. The spirits of the ancestors cannot be
explained as the personification of a natural phenomenon, but they can easily
be explained in terms of social relations. The souls of the dead, which are
revered by their descendants, preserve the continuity, in the imagination of
course, between ancestors and descendants. They assure thecontinuous recognition of the traditional
social order. The ancestral spirit of the family or the tribe personifies its
order. Especially potent sources of religious ideas develop when class
conflicts come to the fore, for then religious ideas become a means through
which the ruling class holds the exploited and oppressed class in obedience and
subjection. Moreover, as soon as class conflicts arise in the course of the
social division of labor, there emerges a distinct class or caste which
specializes in religious matters, namely, the priests. This class is more or less
freed from direct productive labor and lives upon the surplus product of the
others. For this priestly caste religious ideas become a means by which to
support and preserve their privileged status in society. We must not think of
this matter as if it were sheer imposture. On the contrary, this class or
caste, like their ideas, grew out of social and natural relations. Hence they
became just as widely accepted by the mass of people as by the priests. They
constituted a world-view adapted to primitive relationships and to primitive
methods of thought. As a dialectical materialist one must recognize that for a
certain limited period this priesthood played a progressive role. In a time
when men had to exert themselves to the utmost to produce even the barest essentials
of life, the priests represented a social stratum which did not directly
participate in labor and, therefore, could occupy themselves with a number of 
socially important problems for which this very
freedom from directly productive labor was prerequisite. Thus it was the
priests who first developed the elements of science. The beginnings of
astronomy can be traced back to the Egyptian and Babylonian priests; the first
elements of geometry were discovered by priests; they discovered how to measure
land; they developed the ground-plan for constructing temples; they predicted
the rise and fall of the waters of the Nile, etc. The priestly caste developed
the seeds which, in the form of philosophy and natural science, finally put an
end to all priests and all religion.</p>
