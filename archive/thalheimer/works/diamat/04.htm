<H3>4 - Greek Idealism</H3>

<p>From the further development of Greek materialistic philosophy I shall
select only the most prominent names and schools - Anaximander, Heraclitus and
the Atomists, most prominent of whom are Democritus and Empedocles.</p>


<p>I begin with Anaximander.
Like Thales of Miletus, he comes from the renowned Greek commercial city of
which we have already spoken. He lived somewhat after Thales. His theory is
characterized by the proposition that the world has emerged from formless
stuff, from unformed homogeneous matter, as he called it. The development of
this matter or of this formless stuff occurs through its separation into contradictory
elements. This is the way the heavenly bodies came into being, the sun and the
other stars. Man developed from fish-like beings which had taken to the land.
To this conception of the world, of the planets,
and of life, Anaximander added the conception of the future decline of the
world. If the emergence of the world consists in the division of matter, in
the breaking up of matter into opposite elements, then the decline of the
world, of individual beings, consists in dissolution of these elements.
According to Anaximander's theory matter is eternal and indestructible. As you
see, it is a fairly broadly constructed theory of the development of the world,
a theory which is completely materialistic, that is, deriving from natural
causes. One cannot help being astonished at its correctness in the large, at a
time when all the great accomplishments of modern natural science were lacking.</p>





<p>The
second great name which I mention is that of Heraclitus the Obscure, of
Ephesus. The nickname &quot;Obscure&quot; was given to him because of the
obscurity and the difficulty of his writings. Heraclitus was also born in one
of the greatest commercial cities of Greek Asia Minor, Ephesus. This city was
one of the strongest competitors of Miletus. He lived about five hundred years
before Christ. His great significance lies in the fact that he first discovered
and gave expression to the qualities of what later developed into dialectics. I
shall recount his principal ideas. Heraclitus arrived at his conceptions of the
origin and nature of the world by synthesizing previous doctrines concerning
the emergence of the world, the previous cosmology. Every previous philosopher had the world emerging from a
different stuff. One, like Thales, from water, another from light, a third from
stuff in general. From these doctrines Heraclitus elaborated the general
universal transformation of all things. This
conception
he compressed into the striking proposition, &quot;Everything is in
flux&quot;; that is, everything is changing, nothing remains as it is. He also compressed it into another proposition:
&quot;One cannot ascend the same river twice.&quot; This contained the same
thought differently expressed. The river never remains the same; every instant
it is a different river. In this instance, the river, of course, is only a
figure of speech. It serves as the symbol of all the changes in nature and in the
human world. This conception of the unceasing, universal change of all things
can be taken as a fundamental conception of dialectics. According to the view
of Heraclitus the world as a. whole is eternal - that is, infinite in time; and
endless - that is, infinite in space. But this world is always changing; it
never remains the same. This change, however, is not conceived in terms of
modern evolution. According to Heraclitus world-change does not proceed
continuously forward, but in what the physicists and chemists call a circular
process. It is a constant transformation of things, which, however, always
reverts to a certain starting point. For example: like all his predecessors
Heraclitus differentiates four elements: fire, earth, air, and water. These four
elements continuously change into each other, but in such a manner that the 
change always occurs within the same circle of the four elements. This change of things occurs, according to Heraclitus,
not arbitrarily, but in accordance with certain mass relationships. It is
regular change. This also as a new and advanced thought. Heraclitus called the
world an eternal fire - again figuratively, of course. He did not mean that
the world emerged from fire as the prime stuff; fire was merely a figurative
designation for the continual process of change. The world is not a stable
substance, but a continual chemical process. I have already said - and I need
not elaborate - that the Heraclitean conception of chance must not be confused
with the modern concept of evolution. It is a change that occurs in a circle 
and which reverts to the original
starting point.</p>

<p>Another
basic idea of Heraclitus is that this change of all things follows the rule
that opposites always emerge from opposites; that is, that this change always
takes place in the form of contradictions. For this, 
too, he found a striking metaphorical expression: &quot;Conflict is the father
of all things.&quot; The conflict of opposites is the impulse to all change, to
all development. This is also a fundamental conception of dialectics, and
Heraclitus was able to express even this thought in very general fashion. He
applied it to the relation of Being and Non-Being. Heraclitus said
that Being and Non-Being, these two extreme opposites, come
together in the concept of Becoming. The thought is clear. A thing that is
becoming is, and at the same time is not, that thing. These two ideas are
contained in Becoming. Otherwise expressed: The nature of all things and
processes consists of the togetherness of opposites. All things, in other
words, are polar, are composed of opposites or contradictions.</p>

<p>Also germane to the theory of Heraclitus is the
fact that he declared himself against the notion of the immortality of the
soul. He also declared himself against the doctrine that sensual pleasure is
bad, a doctrine which at that time played an important role among certain
religious societies, and we shall soon see why.</p>





<p>I
proceed now to another point, namely, the explanation how this theory of
Heraclitus is connected with the mode of production and with the class relationships
of the time. From your actual observation of contemporary events, it is
understandable to you how a world-view is connected with certain class
attitudes. This observation which we can make today holds for all periods. Each
world-view has its roots in certain class relationships. There is only this
difference; we can very clearly see the modern class relations, 
whereas the class
relations of 2,000 to 3,000 years ago are only in small part known. Often we have to guess at these because the
historical sources are meager. Concerning the class position of Heraclitus we
can roughly say the following:</p>



<p>He
belonged to the <i>
municipal aristocracy </i>
in Ephesus. I have already discussed the rule of the aristocracy in
these cities. Previous to the time of Heraclitus a government of such
aristocrats existed, but this had been unseated by the government of a Tyrant
or military commander.</p>


<p>This
Tyrant was supported by the mass of petty craftsmen and peasants against the aristocracy.
Later the rule of the Tyrant yielded to a more or less restricted democracy
which was brought into Ephesus by the citizens of the city of Athens.
Heraclitus, who belonged to the
aristocracy against which the Tyrant fought and against which the Tyrant played
the masses of the people, was naturally considered a revolutionary. The
existing state of affairs was not to his liking. He was anxious to overthrow
it. Therefore there developed in him the conception that it is a general law of
all existing things not to remain as they are, but to change &#8212; to 
change, indeed, into their opposites. From the 
relations which prevailed in the city he arrived at the idea that conflict is
the impulse of all change. And he came
to the conclusion that this holds not only for political and social relations
in the city, but that it applies universally. I believe that the concept of dialectics will now be accessible to you.
The masses of the people in Ephesus
were severely oppressed and exploited by the Tyrants. They had to work for the
Tyrants, they had to pay heavy tribute, and in part also to perform forced
labor. In this situation the masses of the people sought any ideas at all
which could give them consolation. And so they took refuge in religion, which gave them the consolation they needed. They
established religious groups which sought security in the theory of a Redeemer
who would come and free the people; in the theory of the immortality of the
soul; and in the evil of sensual pleasures - a theory which is very congenial
to an exploited mass of people. When men turn against sensual pleasures, this
signifies a political break with and a repudiation of the luxurious life of the
rich. All should live as simply and frugally as possible, and avoid luxury.
This idea is congenial to the exploited and oppressed masses at a time when the
material prerequisites are not yet at hand for <i>all </i> to be able to live in plenty;
that is to say, when the productiveness of labor is still poorly developed. And
this was the case then, as opposed to the situation now in capitalist society.
Heraclitus' attitude is explained in the simplest manner by reference to the
role of the mass of the people, the role of the Tyrant, and Heraclitus'
own membership in the aristocracy. Since the Tyrant was supported by the mass
of the people against the aristocracy, Heraclitus had to turn against the ideas
of these masses, against their religious ideas, against the conception of a
Redeemer, against the immortality of the soul, and against the doctrine of the
evil or sensual pleasures. Thus you
see that all the fundamental ideas in Heraclitus are determined, are
conditioned by the characteristic class relations of his time.</p>


<p>I should
now like to make a few brief comments on the theory of atoms. Atomic theory or
atomistics was developed by a number of these philosophers of nature. The
principal proposition of the theory maintains that the world consists of
small, identical material parts and empty space. The various movements of these
material parts explain all phenomena. I do not need to develop this theory
further. Atomic theory is today a part of natural science, of chemistry, of
physics, etc. The significance of atomic theory in antiquity, however, lay in
the fact that it was the most consistent development of materialism. This
theory of atoms has played a part in all consistent theories of materialism for
thousands of years.</p>




<p>With
this I close the discussion of the Ionian natural philosophy, the period of
materialistic philosophy in ancient times, and come now to a most important
turning point, when materialist philosophy was replaced by idealist philosophy.
This turning point is linked with the names of two great philosophers of
ancient times, Plato and Aristotle. Plato was born in 429 B.C., Aristotle in
384 B.C. They are thus somewhat later than the Ionian
philosophers of nature. These two philosophers of idealism have had a tremendous
influence on the whole subsequent period, on the philosophy of the Middle Ages,
as well as on the world-view of modern times. In the last analysis we can say
that all idealistic world-views have their origin in Plato and Aristotle. We
will now investigate the reasons for this transition from the materialist to
the idealist world-view. The fundamental reason for this is the complete
development of slave economy as the basis of Greek society and the beginning of
its decline. This society, founded on slave labor, led into a blind alley, with
no way out. In the seventh century <i>slave labor </i>was just appearing in the Greek colonies of Asia Minor, although <i>slave trade </i>was already in full
swing. Industrial labor was, in the main,
performed by handicraftsmen or free wage laborers. In the fifth and fourth
centuries, however, in Athens - where the philosophers, Plato and Aristotle,
lived and taught, slave labor was the foundation of the State and of the whole
economy. Slavery was the basis of the class system in Athens at that time, and
not, as has often superficially been contended, the opposition between
aristocracy and democracy, which was<i> only an opposition within the ruling class which
consisted of free citizens. </i>Both
the rich and poor free citizens were propped on the shoulders of slaves. The
rich as well as the poor freemen in Athens lived at the expense of the slaves,
who were without rights, who were not considered men but simply <i>tools </i> endowed
with speech. That the Athenian people were able to devote themselves to
politics, art, philosophy, gymnastics, and all such fine things was made
possible only by abundant and constant importation of slave laborers. This is
not simply my opinion; it is taken from a work on ancient Athens by a good
bourgeois historian.</p>




<p>I shall now develop the
contradictions which beset a society which is built on a slave economy. First
contradiction and first difficulty: In no slave economy is the natural
propagation of slaves sufficient to maintain it. This experience is not
restricted to antiquity. The same thing occurred in the slave plantations in
the South of the United States of America. To maintain the slave economy, there
must be a continual importation of new slaves. They can be obtained only
through wars or predation. Continual waging of war, which is necessary for a
State built on a slave economy, naturally saps the strength of such a State.
To wage war in ancient times it was necessary for the citizen about to go to
war to furnish his own equipment. This was costly, of course, especially for a
mounted warrior. He had to maintain his horse and a groom. He had to be able to
support his dependants at home as well as himself in the field. This necessity
gradually impoverished the simple farmers and artisans who participated.
Thereby the power of the State was diminished,
and it was exposed to the danger of being conquered by another State where the
farmers and artisans were not yet undermined. To be humbled and conquered meant
something quite different then from what it means today. It meant that the
people would be carried off as slaves - men, women and children.</p>




<p>The
second contradiction in which a society built on slave labor is involved is the
following: It is proudly maintained in such a society that working for a living
is unworthy of a freeman. Labor is stigmatized as unworthy. Labor is only for
slaves. This conception of labor dominated the best and most open minds of
antiquity. And it had a further consequence: The free people who could not
exploit slaves were dependent on the State for a livelihood. They were
parasites, spongers on the State. The unpropertied freeman of antiquity was fundamentally
different from the modern proletarian. The latter through his labor supports
the whole society, the capitalists and everything else. The unpropertied
freeman, the proletarian of antiquity, was supported by the State at 
the expense of slave labor. The State itself maintained a great number of slaves who provided the means of support for the
unpropertied freemen. Moreover, a powerful city like Athens subjugated a great
number of other cities who had to pay tribute, which also served to maintain these
unpropertied freemen. Thus the existence of such a city was naturally very
precarious. A society which rests on such an uncertain foundation as slave
labor becomes increasingly involved in difficulties.</p>


<p>The
third contradiction within this city which was 
at the
same time a state - city and state are here one - 
is the
following: Within this city there developed, 
even
among the freemen, more and more class oppositions.
The great private fortunes increased and fell into the hands of fewer people,
whereas the artisans were impoverished by continual warfare. This sharpened
the opposition between creditors and debtors. At the same time the moral bond
which bound the city dwellers to each other became weaker and weaker, and this
led to continual civil wars which jeopardized the existence of the State more
and more.</p>




<p>Further,
I should like to mention a fourth and very important point in the realm of economics: Slave labor hinders
technical progress. The connection here is very clear. Since slaves work only under
compulsion, they cannot be given very delicate or complicated tools. Slave
labor can only be accomplished with the crudest and roughest tools. As soon as
slave labor becomes the characteristic phenomenon of a society, technical
development is hindered, and the development of the forces of production is
brought to a standstill. Thus, at the height of the slave economy in antiquity
we find technical stagnation and also a loss of 
the
interest in natural science such as was prevalent in the colonies of Asia Minor
which we have mentioned.</p>

<p>These conditions resulted in the following: first,
that the problem of development in nature and the problem of the origin of the
world no longer stood in the foreground as they did in the ascending period of
Greek social development. Instead, the questions characteristic of society in
its middle stage are emphasized: How should man live, how should the State be
governed, how should the economy be carried on, what is good, what is evil,
what is permitted, what is forbidden? All these questions of morals now become
matters of controversy.</p>

<p>The
second and most important result linked with the transition to the declining
phase of ancient society is the transition from the materialistic to the
idealistic world-view. This critical change from materialism to idealism is
conditioned by, and based on the facts which I have already set forth. It was
conditioned, namely, by the circumstance that the old slave owning society had
passed its apex and had entered upon its declining phase.</p>

<p>I should
like to sketch very briefly the main features of Plato's idealism so that you
may know something about the idealism here indicated. According to Plato, the
true essence of things does not consist of a stuff, as the philosophers of
nature had said, but rather the principle of the world is spiritual,
non-material. The world of the senses, the world of sense-experience is notin Plato's conception, an actual and true world, but only
apparent and illusory. This world of sensory phenomena is only a consequence, a
copy of eternal Ideas, of eternal spiritual prototypes, which are independent
of material phenomena. Thus the true locus of things is posited in the mind.
The highest idea is the idea of the Good. These ideas not only are the true
essence, the very kernel of the world; they are, moreover, the ultimate impulse
and the ultimate measure of all events. With Aristotle this is further developed:
Reason is the essence, the ultimate impulse or prime mover of all worldly
events.</p>


<p>But upon
precisely what is this transition from materialism to idealism based? In the
last analysis upon the fact that there is, from the standpoint of the ruling
class of this period, no material, historical, progressive solution of social
contradictions, as I have already shown. It is not possible for a slave economy
to make the transition to a higher form of society and economy. It is a blind
alley, a<i> cul-de-sac. </i>I have explained to you how the Christian religion grew up among the
oppressed classes. In the same way idealistic
philosophy grew on in the ruling class at this critical moment in the Athenian
State. This idealistic philosophy became an element and a basis of later
Christianity. What social aim did this idealist doctrine have? Its aim was to
idealize the existing social situation, that is, to beautify to eliminate the contradictions in it, to immortalize it. The
supremacy of the Idea, the supremacy
of Reason, was only a universalization of the theory that the reasonable and the wise should rule. And of course every
ruling class conceives these to he the members of the ruling class itself. The
people, according to this notion, are unreasonable, and it is always a very
small minority, the ruling class, which is reasonable. When this theory is
carried from the State over to the whole world, idealistic philosophy appears,
the concept of the supremacy of Reason over all things. In the later centuries
and millennia this idealistic philosophy generally became one of the strongest
foundations for the views of the ruling class. But you must not think that the
philosophy of Plato and Aristotle was in their time reactionary <i> within </i>
the ruling class. It was not. Ancient society had
no way out. There was no class in this society which could offer any sort of
antithetical, revolutionary outlet. On the question of slavery, democracy in
ancient Greece did not and could not have a fundamentally different viewpoint,
since its existence was based on resources of the State provided by slave
labor. It would be a very great error to mistake the democracy of Greek
antiquity for bourgeois or proletarian democracy. The opposition between
ancient Greek democracy and modern bourgeois democracy is even greater than
that between bourgeois and proletarian democracy. The basic problems of this ancient
society were not those of democracy or aristocracy; these were only problems of
the superstructure. The basic problem was slave labor, the relation of the
slaves to freemen. The reactionary aspect of this philosophy stands out in bold
relief only <i>
in relation to slavery, </i>
in the fact that it is the philosophy of a slave
owning society, based upon slave labor. It appears reactionary in the light of
later historical development which abolished slave labor and substituted more
progressive forms of exploitation. But this philosophy not only had a reactionary
aspect; it also had a progressive aspect. We shall speak of this in the next
chapter.</p>
