<H3>Preface to the German edition</H3>





<p>The following lectures, under the title
of &quot;The Modern World-View,&quot; were delivered in Moscow in the spring of
1927 before second-term students of the Sun Yat-Sen University. They were
delivered in German, and every paragraph or section was followed by a
translation into Chinese. The brevity, of the individual lectures is
ascribable to this devious method of presentation, which at times limited a
single lecture to three-quarters of an hour and necessarily made them extremely
concise.</p>





<p>At the same time, the need
for translation demanded the simplest possible style. Moreover, the
presentation had to be as elementary as possible because of the great
differences in education among my Chinese listeners, differences between those
who had been students in Europe and the young workers. Especially in European
history and literature was there much that could not be taken for granted -
although, of course, one could assume a great deal of knowledge of Chinese
history and literature which is not part of the average European education.</p>





<p>Since the course had to be completed within a comparatively short
time, a systematic and exhaustive treatment was impossible; it had to be
limited to those fundamental theoretic concepts which were most important to
the given audience.</p>





<p>The
purpose of the lectures was to help the Chinese listeners, as well as possible
Chinese readers, towards an <i> independent orientation</i>to the principal philosophic world-views which impinged upon them. For this
reason the historical form of presentation was chosen. It also accounts for the
review of ancient Indian and Chinese philosophy as well as pragmatism.
Unfortunately, sufficient source-material for a contemplated treatment of the
currents in modern Chinese philosophy was not available.</p>





<p>The
lectures were stenographically recorded and only slightly edited, and they
remain essentially as given. It was therefore further intended to add to the
small number of literary quotations contained in the lectures. Instead,
however, marginal notes were placed beside each paragraph or section to help
the reader's perspective.<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup></p>





<p>The
author hopes that the lectures will also be of use to European readers who wish
to be introduced to dialectical materialism. He refers, above all, to young revolutionary
workers.</p>





<p>The reader trained in Marxism will notice that a
number of themes are treated here either for the first time or in new
connections. Some of these are ancient dialectics, ancient Indian and Chinese
philosophy, and the development of the inner connections between the main
propositions of materialistic dialectics.</p>

<p>I should be pleased if the ideas sketched here
inspired further detailed Marxist research.</p>

<H3><a name="american"></a>Preface to the American edition</H3>



<p>For details
about the origin of this book, which reproduces a series of lectures, the
reader is referred to the preface of the German edition, reprinted here.</p>

<p>The book has
appeared in Russian, Japanese, and Spanish, as well as in German. The original
German edition has long been out of print. Owners of copies in Germany have to
conceal them carefully from the eyes of the &quot;Gestapo,&quot; the
government secret police. Consequently the translators had considerable difficulty
hunting out an extra German copy.</p>


<p>For American
readers the following comments may be in order: The book is meant for readers
who have no special philosophic training, but who are connected with the labor
movement - that is, it is meant primarily for workers. In virtue of their class
position and their class experience much of its content will be clearer to them
than to bourgeois intellectuals, who, though they may indeed be practiced in
abstract thought, will approach the subject with their peculiar class prejudices,
with deep-rooted habits of thought, and with traditional academic concepts.</p>



<p>I have taken pains
to present the subject in the simplest possible language and to relate it as
much as possible to everyday experience. But let no one therefore be misled
into thinking that the subject itself is &quot;simple&quot; or
&quot;commonplace.&quot; The fruits of more than two thousand years of
painstaking and involved intellectual labor are contained in materialistic
dialectics - a labor shared by many peoples. The readers may rest assured that
it is much easier to present the subject in traditional philosophic language.
For students this might have certain superficial advantages. But it would not
make the problem itself any easier nor would it help the workers, who
constituted the main contingent of my European readers and whom I chiefly wish
to address here in America as well.</p>



<p>Usually, when
confronted with an introduction to a science, one assumes that the science
itself already exists in elaborate systematic form, in formal texts. But this
does not apply to materialistic dialectics, and it can be safely said that it
will still be some time before there will be a text for materialist dialectics
as systematic and complete as Hegel's <i>Logic</i>
is for idealistic dialectics, or as many texts on formal logic. To make way for
such a text a tremendous amount of preliminary labor is necessary, among other
things, the critical examination of all materials in the history of philosophy
as sources.</p>


<p>Readers who
wish to go more deeply into the subject should refer to the works of Karl Marx,
Friedrich Engels, Plekhanoff, Labriola, Franz Mehring, and Lenin, who treat of
the problems of philosophy and the history of philosophy. And, if they wish to
go further and make independent investigations in the field of materialistic
dialectics, they should, on the basis of the groundwork thus laid, make a critical
study of the principal works of philosophy and the principal contributions of
modern natural science, as well as the Marxist social sciences.</p>


<p>Readers who
have neither the opportunities nor the inclination for this sort of study (and
these will doubtless be in the majority) are advised that conscious
participation in the struggles of our time, which is uncommonly full of sudden
crises and sharp contradictions, will provide more than enough material for a
deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts and methods of materialistic
dialectics. Such participation can make these principles and methods a vital
part of oneself, an instrument of thought for daily use &#8212; i.e., it can teach
one to &quot;think dialectically&quot;.</p>



<p>This book is
not meant for casual spectators; nor is it meant for those who are or wish to
be academic philosophers. It is intended primarily as a tool for practical and
conscious participants in the class struggle of today</p>


<p>Perhaps it may
also be of some service to natural scientists who wish to become acquainted with unbiased
methods of thought which depart from tradition but which are closely related
to the &quot;instinctive&quot; materialism of natural-science practice.</p>
