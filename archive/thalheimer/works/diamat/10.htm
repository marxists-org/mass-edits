<H3>10 - Dialectics I</H3>



<p>In this
chapter we will discuss dialectics proper. Previous chapters have shown that
dialectics has a history which embraces many thousands of years and that it has
passed through various stages of development. Disregarding the beginnings of
dialectics in Indian and Chinese philosophy, the following main stages can be
distinguished: (1) the dialectics of
the old Greek philosophers of nature,
Heraclitus; (2) the second and higher stage, the dialectics of
Plato and Aristotle; (3) Hegelian dialectics; and (4) materialistic
dialectics. Dialectics itself has undergone
a dialectical development. Heraclitus, representing the first stage,
develops the dialectics of one-after-the-other; Plato and Aristotle,
representing the second stage, develop the dialectics of one-beside-the-other.
The latter is in opposition to the dialectics of the first stage, being its
negation. Hegel embraces both
preceding stages of development and raises them to a higher stage. He develops
the dialectics of the one-after-the-other and the one-beside-the-other, but in
an idealistic form; in other words, he develops an historico-idealistic
dialectics. The dialectics of antiquity was limited. I pointed out earlier
where the basis of this limitation is to be found: namely, in the mode of
production and the class relations of ancient Greece, particularly in the slave
economy and in the social relations resulting from this slave economy. Not
until the advent of materialistic dialectics were these limitations completely
overcome. This new dialectics is not restricted; it is universalized. And here
too I will briefly point out the relation of this universalized dialectics to
the fundamental relations of class and production. Materialistic dialectics is
developed by workers who have the working-class point of view, the point of
view of the proletarian revolution. This point of view demands the elimination
of classes, and consequently the elimination of class society. As a result of
the elimination of classes and class society, the last limitation on social
development and on the idea of development in general collapses. For Aristotle
as well as for Plato and even Hegel, class society itself was something that
development could not transcend. For Plato and Aristotle slave economy was the
final and absolute limitation; with Hegel it was bourgeois society. In
dialectical materialism, however, or from the viewpoint of the working class,
class society is not in itself ultimate or final; it is by no means the absolute
limit of social development. It is itself subject to dialectical development
and is part of the stream of social evolution. The generalized and at the same
time materialistic form of dialectics is a natural result of the generalization
of this point of view. Incidentally, bourgeois scholars have of late again
turned to dialectics. In one form or another Hegel's dialectics has
been revived in Germany. In France the philosopher Bergson has developed a
peculiar form of dialectics. However, this bourgeois form of dialectics, as it
has reappeared in recent years, is idealistic throughout; or, as in the case of
Bergson, it is an idealistic dialectics which at the same time reverts to the
first stage of dialectics, i.e., to the point of view of Heraclitus.</p>





<p>Dialectics may be
characterized as the science which treats of the general relations in nature,
in history, and in thought. The opposite of dialectics is the isolated
consideration of things, and the consideration of things only in their fixity.
Dialectics, on the contrary, considers all things in their most general relations,
in their mutual relations of dependency, not in their fixity but in their
development. The question might be raised: How do we know of this mysterious
science of dialectics? Whence do we procure this wisdom? There are three
sources from which dialectics has been derived. The first source is nature, the
observation of natural processes. This is how Heraclitus first came upon the
idea of dialectics. The second source is the observation of human history, of
changes which occur from one historical period to another, changes in the mode
of production, in the forms of society, and in the social ideologies associated
with them. This is the second source. The third source is the examination of
human thought itself. And here a further question is raised: what is the
guarantee that the laws of dialectical thought that we find in our minds
correspond to the laws of reality, to the laws of change in nature and in
history? This correspondence is not particularly remarkable, for man, after
all, is only a part of nature. Human thought is in the last analysis a natural
process, of the same kind as any other process in nature. That human thought
corresponds to the laws of nature and history is, therefore, not astonishing.
Rather, one could say that the opposite would be inconceivable.</p>





<p>I cannot, of course, develop
all the details of dialectics in a work of this scope. What I propose to do is
to develop its fundamental laws. I shall give several examples as a basis of
elucidation. Further, I shall point out the inner relation of these fundamental
laws of dialectics. If these things are a bit difficult, it must be realized
that they can only be understood through repeated study. Yet you will find that
they are not incomprehensible secrets, that ultimately anyone can grasp them
because everyone has the proof of dialectics in his daily experience as well
as in his own mind. In this respect human
thought is exactly the same in all minds.</p>





<p>The most
general and the most inclusive fundamental law of dialectics from which all
others are deduced is the law of the permeation of opposites. This law has a
two-fold meaning: first, that all things, all processes, all concepts merge in
the last analysis into an absolute unity, or, in other words, that there are no
opposites, no differences which cannot ultimately be comprehended into a
unity. Second, and just as unconditionally valid, that all things are at the
same time absolutely different and absolutely or unqualifiedly opposed. This
law may also be referred to as the law of the polar unity of opposites. This
law applies to every single thing, to every single phenomenon, and to the
world as a whole. Viewing thought and its method alone, it can also be put this
way: <p>The human mind is capable of
infinite condensation of things into unities, even the sharpest contradictions
and opposites, and, on the other hand, it is capable of infinite
differentiation and analysis of things into opposites. The human mind can
establish this unlimited unity and unlimited differentiation because this unlimited
unity and differentiation is present in reality.</p>




<p>
A few examples will make this
universal law clearer. Take the example of night and day. There 
is the twelve-hour day and the twelve-hour night, a period of light
and a period of darkness. Day and night are opposites; they are mutually
exclusive. This, however, does not
prevent their being, at the same time, parts of a 24-hour 
day. Take another example: male and female.
These particular opposites played a decisive rule in ancient Chinese
philosophy. The opposition between male and female was made the fundamental law
of the philosophy of Yih-king or <i>
Book of Transformations. </i>Male and female
are opposites. But this does not prevent man and woman from being identical,
from coinciding as forms of the more general concept, mankind. Insofar as they
both are forms of mankind they are completely identical. Take other opposites,
opposites in nature such as rest and motion. Common sense regards rest and
motion as absolutely different processes. Whatever rests, rests, and whatever
moves, moves. The physicist, however, conceives of rest merely as a special
kind of motion and vice versa. He can look upon every motion as a kind of rest.
Those who are acquainted with modern physics will have a better comprehension
of these things. Let us consider another opposition which appears to be
absolute: it is customary to oppose art and nature. As opposed to the creations
of nature, art is a creation of man. Art, however, is also a part of nature,
since the man who produces art is himself nothing but a part of nature. These
examples could be multiplied indefinitely,
and their implications are much more far-reaching than these simple examples
indicate. I cite these, however, so that you will have as clear a conception
as possible of this law.</p>


<p>Where only simple objects of direct perception are involved, and
where strong social interests are not involved, this conception which asserts
the identity of opposites will usually meet with no difficulties. Obstacles to
this conception present themselves when social interests oppose it or when it
is no longer a question of ideas or concepts closely related to direct sense
perception but of general concepts far removed from sense perception. Here too
I will give a few examples. It is very easy for us to realize today that the
slave as well as the slave-owner is a human being, although socially they are
the most extreme opposites conceivable. But if you had told a Greek, even the
most intelligent, that the slave and the slave-owner were alike as human
beings, he would not have accepted it under any circumstances and would have
answered that they were absolutely opposed to each other and that there could
be no identity between them. Or take a modern instance, the capitalist and the
proletarian, the employer and the worker. Every bourgeois will take for
granted that the capitalist and the proletarian are opposed. In fact, he will
maintain that this opposition has always existed and will always exist, and
that it cannot be bridged. In order to understand that thisopposition is historical and transitory,
one must have the the point of view of the the revolutionary working class. Or
take another matter which is closer to you: we spoke before of man and woman.
Everyone will admit that man and woman, from the point of view of natural
science, are members of the same species, that man and woman are homogeneous,
human in the same way. But as soon as I come to the social realm, contradictions
immediately arise. A whole series of major historical revolutions would be
necessary for mankind to conceive and apply the idea that woman should have the
same human rights that man has. I don't have to tell you that in a great many countries
of the Orient practical recognition of the equality between man and woman has
not yet been realized. In all these cases a person who has not learned to think
dialectically and who is moved by particular interests will maintain that these
opposites are absolute. Only a person trained in dialectics will perceive the
permeation of opposites. Of course, this does not depend only upon training in
dialectics, but also upon the class viewpoint, the social viewpoint which the
individual adopts. I should like to consider one more question which belongs in
the same field. You know that in the United States a social distinction is made
between white and colored people, and in Europe between the European, who is
supposed to represent a higher class, and the colored, black and yellow races.
To comprehend, both theoretically and
practically, that these are not absolute opposites but that they are united in
the concept of mankind which is shared equally by the white, the black, and the
yellow - to comprehend this requires not only a dialectically-trained mind, but
also a definite class viewpoint. The untrained mind, however, is confronted
with peculiar difficulties when general concepts are in question, difficulties
which increase the more abstract, the more obscure, and the farther removed
these concepts are from sense perception. That both day and night are parts of
the twenty-four-hour day is easily understood. But it is more difficult with
such opposites as true and false, and still more difficult with the concepts of
being and non-being, which are the most general of all, the most inclusive,
and, at the same time, the poorest in content. The average person will say: how
can one unite such absolute opposites as being and non-being? Either a thing is
or it is not. There can be no bridge or common ground between them. In the
treatment of Heraclitus I have already shown how the concepts of being and
non-being actually permeate each other in everything that changes, how they are
contained in changing things at the same time and in the same way; for a thing
which is developing is something and at the same time is not that something.
For example: a child which is developing into a man is a child and at the same
time not a child. So far as it is becoming
a man, it ceases to be a child. But it is not yet a man, because it has not yet
developed into a man. The concept of becoming contains the concepts of being
and non-being. In this concept they permeate each other. Or let us take another
example which I have already given, the example of ordinary locomotion, i.e.,
when a body moves from one place to another. While it is moving it is at a
certain place, and at the same time it is not at this place. I will take a
third opposition, a great stumbling-block for common sense, the opposition of
material and mental, of materiality and thought, or of materiality and
consciousness. The average untutored mind believes that these two opposites
have nothing in common. The material is not mental, and the mental is not
material, and that is that. We have already demonstrated how both become a
unity; how thought, the mental, is a material activity and is therefore bound
to the material.</p>


<p>Now I will show you the obverse side of the medal, the other aspect
of the proposition of the permeation of opposites. We said at the outset that
there were no opposites which could not be united, no opposites between which
there was no identity. Now we maintain at the same time that there are no two
things between which there is not some difference, some opposition. In other
words: the opposition of things is just as unlimited as their identity. To make
this clearer I will tell you a little anecdote taken from the history of
philosophy. German philosopher, Leibnitz, who lived at the end of the seventeenth
and during the first half of the eighteenth century, formulated the proposition
that there are no two things which are not different. One day he was out
walking with a group of courtiers. The conversation turned upon this proposition
and someone proposed to see whether or not there were two identical leaves on a
certain tree standing by the wayside. The ladies and gentlemen of the court
examined the tree and, of course, could not find two leaves which were
perfectly identical. It is in the nature of things as well as in the nature of
mind that no two things exist which do not differ. The same can be said of two
rain drops. One will never be exactly like the other. Or take the smallest
components of matter: two electrons which form parts of an atomic system can
never be absolutely identical. We can say this with certainty even though we
are not yet in a position to know anything about the individual peculiarities
of electrons. (As far as atoms and molecules are concerned, we can at least
determine differences in kind.) This is based on the proposition of the
permeation of opposites, the proposition which says that the identity of things
is just as unlimited as their difference. The capacity of the mind infinitely
to equate things as well as to differentiate and oppose, corresponds to the infinite identity and difference of things in
nature. This is primary. You will also find
the same thing if you compare all the most general concepts, such as being and
non-being, materiality and thought, etc. We have previously shown that being
and non-being exist simultaneously in becoming, that they constitute identical
elements of becoming. But this does not preclude their being opposites at the
same time, i.e., being and non-being are different.</p>

<p>This law of the permeation of opposites will probably be new to
you, something to which you have not previously given thought. Upon closer
examination you will discover that you cannot utter a single meaningful
sentence which does not comprehend this proposition. Except for sentences such
as, &quot;A lion is a lion,&quot; where the subject and predicate are
identical, a meaningless sentence, this proposition can be found everywhere.
Let us take a rather common sentence: &quot;The lion is a beast of prey.&quot;
A thing, A, the lion, is equated with a thing B. At the same time a distinction
is made between A and B. So far as the lion is a beast of prey, it is equated
with all beasts of that kind. At the same time, in the same sentence, it is
distinguished from the kind. It is impossible to utter a sentence which will
not contain the formula, A equals B. All meaningful sentences have a form which
is conditioned by the permeation of opposites. This contradiction contained in
every meaningful sentence, the equation and at the same time the differentiation
between subject and predicate, had already been noticed by the so-called
&quot;sophists&quot; of the classic period of Chinese philosophy when they
argued whether or not &quot;white horse&quot; was really a horse.</p>


<p>Now our question is: what is the origin of this basic law? And this
is the answer: in the first place, it is a generalization of experience. In
daily life and in science we constantly have to search for the identities as
well as the differences of things, and experience shows that there are no
rigid, fixed limits to the discovery of either. Existing limits are mobile,
relative, and temporary; they are constantly being broken, reset, and rebroken.</p>

<p>Secondly, this law of the permeation of opposites may be deduced
from the examination of thought itself. It is a law of thought as well as of
nature. In thought this law is inherent in the basis of consciousness, and
this basis consists in the fact that I know that I am a part of the universe, a
part of being, and, on the other hand, in the fact that I know myself to be distinct
from the external world, distinct from other things. The basic structure of
thought is, from the very beginning, a polar unity of opposites, and from this
all other laws of thought are derived. Furthermore, this polar unity of thought
corresponds to the nature of all things</p>
