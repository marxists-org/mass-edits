    <P CLASS="pagenoteb">The report included here comes from an unsigned copy
      in the Arbejderbev&aelig;gelsens Arkiv in Copenhagen, and has been
      identified as the work of August Thalheimer (cf KH Tjaden, <I>Struktur
      und Funktion der KPD-Opposition (KPO)</I>, p335, n114; Volume 2, p200),
      who was in Catalonia from 19 November to 4 December 1936, and sent back
      reports in code, not only to the KPO but to its co-thinkers, such as the
      Leninist League in Glasgow. Our version comes from Gruppe Arbeiterstimme,
      <I>Der Spanische B&uuml;rgerkrieg</I>, Nuremburg, 1987, pp32-40, and has
      been translated by Esther Leslie and Mike Jones, whom we have to thank not
      only for his labour upon the text, but also for his careful research on
      all the German source material that appears in this volume.</P>
    
    <P CLASS="pagenoteb">August Thalheimer (1884-1948) was a member of the
      German Social Democratic Party before the First World War, and editor of
      one of its papers, the <I>Volksfreund</I>. From 1916 he assisted in the
      production of the <I>Spartakusbriefe</I>, was a member of the USPD
      (Independent Socialists) from 1917, and a founder member of the German
      Communist Party (KPD). He quickly rose to prominence as the party&#146;s
      main theoretician, being editor of <I>Rote Fahne</I> as well as of Franz
      Mehring&#146;s manuscripts left unpublished at his death.</P>
    
    <P CLASS="pagenoteb">During the 1923 crisis he was Minister of Finance in
      the W&uuml;rttemburg local government, was subsequently blamed along with
      Brandler for the deb&acirc;cle, and was called to Moscow in 1924, where he
      worked in the Communist International apparat, as well as for the
      Marx-Engels Institute. His lectures delivered at the Sun Yat-Sen
      University in 1927 were published as a textbook in philosophy (which
      appeared in English as <I>Introduction to Dialectical Materialism</I>,
      New York, 1936), and he also worked on the draft programme of the
      Comintern along with Bukharin. Pressure from the KPD, still uneasy with
      the leadership of Th&auml;lmann, secured his return to Germany in 1928,
      but a year later he was expelled from the KPD along with Brandler, and
      they went on to form the KPO, or Brandlerites.</P>
    
    <P CLASS="pagenoteb">The Brandlerite organisation restricted most of its
      criticisms to the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, whilst maintaining
      that its domestic operations were basically healthy. Thalheimer insisted
      that: &#145;We do not want to draw the conclusion that as the politics of
      the Comintern are wrong, it must follow that the politics of Russia are
      also wrong.&#146; (<I>GdST</I>, 4/1931) Thalheimer himself supported
      forced collectivisation and Stakhanovism, and whilst in Barcelona became
      involved in a heated argument with Nin over the POUM&#146;s condemnation
      of the first Moscow Trial.</P>
    
    <P CLASS="pagenoteb">In exile in Paris from 1932 onwards, Thalheimer went
      to Spain in 1936, and then back to France again where the KPO&#146;s exile
      organisation worked. When six members of the KPO were arrested in
      Barcelona by the Stalinists and charged with the usual crimes in July
      1937, he issued a statement co-signed by Brandler saying that:</P>
    
    <P CLASS="pagenoteb">&#145;We take upon ourselves any political and
      personal guarantee for our arrested comrades. They are anti-Fascists and
      revolutionaries, incapable of any action that could be construed as high
      treason to the Spanish Revolution.&#146;</P>
    
    <P CLASS="pagenoteb">They were not to stay long in Paris. In 1940 France
      fell to Hitler, and Thalheimer fled to Cuba, where he died in 1948.</P>
    
    <P CLASS="pagenoteb">The aim of the visit was to gather general information
      about the political situation in Catalonia, as well as information needed
      to prepare the international conference in Barcelona planned for January.</P>
    
    <P>I was kitted out with a passport for the journey by the Catalan legation
      in Paris. This proved to be sufficient. Departure, Paris Thursday, 19
      November 1936 from the Quai d&#146;Orsay, change at Toulouse, arrived
      Narbonne 23.27 hours, overnight stay in Narbonne, continued on to
      Perpignan 07.55 hours.</P>
    
    <P>In Perpignan I looked up the Comit&eacute; de Vigilance on the Place
      Aragon. A comrade from the POUM, who takes care of communication between
      Barcelona and Perpignan, was there as well as a comrade from the Barcelona
      leadership of the POUM. Two younger comrades from Switzerland who wanted
      to go to the front also turned up. These comrades had been turned away
      from the Spanish border town of Port-Bou days earlier because they did not
      have the necessary papers. In the meantime, by chance, they had bumped
      into Comrade Kahlman from Switzerland, who had come from the Catalan front
      and who vouched for them with the Spanish comrades.</P>
    
    <P>Left Perpignan with the two Swiss comrades and a comrade from the POUM
      at 12.30 hours. The border control at the French border town of Cerb&egrave;re
      took place on the train and went quite quickly without problems. The
      Spanish border town is Port-Bou, and you arrive there in a few minutes
      through a tunnel. The controls there are carried out predominantly by the
      CNT people and they are very thorough. Due to the presence of comrades
      from the POUM our control went through very quickly.</P>
    
    <P>Left Port-Bou for Barcelona at about three o&#146;clock. The train had
      been taken over by the CNT, and they carried out a very careful passport
      check on the way to Barcelona. The third class compartments of the train
      were very overcrowded. Everybody there was a worker, or at least was
      wearing workers&#146; clothes, or military people, etc. The atmosphere was
      lively, cheerful and confident. As we reached the outskirts of Barcelona
      the <I>Internationale</I> was being sung in several carriages. At the
      station there was a further baggage check.</P>
    
    <P>The POUM comrade took us from the station to the Hotel Falc&oacute;n in
      the Ramblas (the main street) where we were immediately billeted. From
      there the POUM comrade took us on to the Executive Committee of the POUM,
      where I met Arquer who had been at the Brussels conference. I also met
      Bonet, the treasurer of the Executive Committee. I told them the purpose
      of my visit and gave the treasurer $200 from the American CP(O). He told
      me that an official receipt would appear in <I>La Batalla</I> and in
      other POUM papers. In reply to my question Arquer told me that an
      international conference would take place in mid-January. The POUM
      regarded the Brussels conference as a failure. Arquer explained to me that
      he found it incomprehensible and contradictory that we should reject the
      politics of the Communist International but accept the internal politics
      of the Soviet Union. I tried to enlighten him as to our position in this
      matter, but I did not get the impression that I was successful. Arquer and
      Bonet belong to the Maur&iacute;n wing of the POUM.</P>
    
    <P>The former Trotskyists who are on the Executive Committee come fairly
      close to defending the Trotskyist position on the Soviet Union. The others
      make concessions to this Trotskyist position but do not adhere to it too
      closely. But it is quite clear from their official papers that the Maur&iacute;n
      wing rejects our position on the Soviet Union. However, it must be added
      that, according to the statements of our German comrades, who are closely
      connected with the POUM membership, it would seem that some of the members
      are very critical of their Executive&#146;s position on the Soviet Union.
      This is not an insignificant point. It stems mainly from a reaction to the
      change of line adopted by the Soviet Union in respect of delivery of
      weapons and food to Spain. However, the mood of the POUM members can be
      summed up like this: they want a good and friendly relationship with the
      Soviet Union and reject any anti-Bolshevik tendencies, but they are
      nevertheless determined to prevent any Soviet and Comintern influence on
      their policies in Spain or Catalonia.</P>
    
    <P>The membership is quite convinced that it is they who should determine
      policy in Catalonia, and are therefore not interested in being dictated to
      by the representatives of the Comintern and the Soviet Union. This
      especially hits home as regards the policy of the Popular Front and their
      slogan, &#145;For the Defence of Bourgeois Democracy&#146;, which is
      expressed on a whole number of issues formulated by the party of the
      Comintern in Catalonia, the PSUC. There is sharp opposition to the PSUC.
      Every day there are vigorous polemics in the POUM and PSUC papers. The
      POUM&#146;s attitude to the PSUC largely determines the attitude of the
      POUM membership to the politics of the Comintern.</P>
    
    <P>The Ramblas is crowded with people until late at night. The caf&eacute;s
      and bars are all full. The public appears thoroughly proletarian according
      to their clothes and so on. There are few bourgeois around. You get the
      impression that the town is thoroughly controlled by proletarian elements.
      The houses are plastered with posters from the CNT, FAI, POUM and PSUC.
      There are hardly any posters from the Esquerra to be seen anywhere. Along
      the Ramblas a row of large kiosks with newspapers, books and portraits
      have been set up by individual political parties. The proletarian
      appearance of the crowds makes the street scenes reminiscent of Moscow in
      the immediate post-revolutionary years. There are a lot of milicianos in
      leather or silk jackets, and countless workers&#146; patrols carrying
      weapons. It is rare to see the khaki of a regular soldier&#146;s uniform.
      The only police are traffic police in blue uniforms and white pith
      helmets. These police no longer have the power of arrest.</P>
    
    <P>Along the length of the Ramblas are countless loudspeakers bringing
      reports from the front and messages from abroad, and playing revolutionary
      and sometimes popular music. The crowds in the street seem lively, self
      confident and optimistic. There is not the vaguest glimmer of depression.
      The news broadcast over the loudspeakers is eagerly discussed by the
      masses. It would appear that, even in respect to the fate of Madrid,<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP>
      there is no nervousness. Unlike Moscow in the early years, the shops in
      the Ramblas are nearly all open for business.</P>
    
    <P>I met some of our comrades right away in the Hotel Falc&oacute;n. By
      coincidence comrade H<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#2" NAME="2b">2)</A></SUP>
      happened to be there too, on leave from the front. Here too the mood was
      thoroughly confident.</P>
    
    <P><B>Saturday, 21 November 1936</B>: A discussion with Bonet, a member of
      the POUM Executive Committee. I asked him the reasons for the entry of the
      POUM into the Catalan government.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#3" NAME="3b">3)</A></SUP>
      He explained that had they not joined, it would have meant their complete
      isolation from the masses in the factories and the community, etc.
      Moreover, in exchange for their participation, they had demanded certain
      guarantees, for example a Socialist economic programme and their inclusion
      on all official bodies.</P>
    
    <P>In answer to my questions about military formations, Bonet explained to
      me that workers&#146; organisations exercise complete control over the
      army. The PSUC had tried to eliminate both this and the milicianos, but
      these attempts had failed. I discovered from other sources that the decree
      about the militarisation<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#4" NAME="4b">4)</A></SUP>
      of the Catalan front had not actually been carried out. Just as before,
      there are still the party units with their corresponding political
      commissars. The POUM, like other political organisations, has a special
      military section in its Central Committee, responsible for its military
      wing. The state apparatus has been thoroughly purged of all Fascist
      elements.</P>
    
    <P>After this I had a discussion with a POUM comrade, a mechanic, who
      performs the job of fiscal (public prosecutor) in a people&#146;s court
      (in Barcelona there are four of them). The judges are chosen by the
      various workers&#146; organisations. Each court has a bourgeois judge, a
      professionally trained one, who exercises purely formal functions. The
      trials are actually directed by the fiscal. The people&#146;s judges are
      not bound by any written laws, but rather make decisions on the basis of
      their own assessment, in line with their own class experience. The
      structure of the trial is also no longer bound by the old rules, and
      appears, in contrast, relatively free and its procedures quite
      appropriate. The accused may have a defence lawyer, and members of the
      public may make statements on behalf of the accused. The accused often
      take advantage of this opportunity, as statements from the public
      generally tend to have more effect on proletarian judges than the
      interventions of a lawyer.</P>
    
    <P>Trivial non-political cases are still dealt with by the remaining
      structures of the old legal system, ostensibly because the people&#146;s
      courts are too busy with political cases, and cannot be bothered with more
      trivial matters. But that is a provisional rule and there is a move to
      clear out all the old bourgeois judges, policemen, etc. The proletarian
      judges of the people&#146;s courts are paid by the government. As a rule
      they continue to work in the factories, and devote only a part of their
      time to the legal system.</P>
    
    <P>In the evening the comrades with whom I had detailed discussions, mainly
      about the International, stressed that they wish to continue receiving
      material from the Trotskyists, as they are unable to get hold of such
      material in Barcelona.</P>
    
    <P>On the question of the reform of the International, all the comrades
      insisted that we cannot expect such a solution to meet with the approval
      of the POUM comrades at this moment in time. The CNT is similarly
      uninterested in any sort of link with the Comintern. This is most
      noticeable in their tense and hostile relationship with the PSUC, which is
      seen as a brake on the revolution in a number of concrete matters. It is
      seen as inhibiting progress towards Socialism, and as a force behind which
      all sorts of bourgeois and petit-bourgeois elements (Esquerra, Social
      Democrats, etc) gather.</P>
    
    <P><B>Sunday, 22 November 1936</B>: Durruti&#146;s funeral was this
      afternoon. The attendance at the parade and in the streets was massive.
      The whole city was out. The CNT ordered that all shops, bars, etc, should
      be closed during the ceremony. Most people organised by the CNT and the
      FAI were present at the gathering. Particularly interesting was the troop
      of control patrols (Checas) in their black uniforms. They turned out in
      their hundreds.</P>
    
    <P>I learned the truth about Durruti&#146;s death from Nin, whom I met
      afterwards in a POUM bar. This is the way it was. On returning to the
      front Durruti ran into a group of milicianos coming away from the front.
      He asked them to go back. There was fight and he was shot by one of them.
      The public is unclear about the real story, and assumes that Durruti was
      killed by a Fascist bullet during an ambush. Durruti&#146;s end is not
      inconceivable, according to reports of his general behaviour. POUM
      comrades told me how he was once most unfair and despotic in his dealings
      with a POUM column, and it was mooted at the time that certain people
      wanted to kill him. Durruti was very capable militarily, but he often
      seemed too undisciplined and despotic.</P>
    
    <P><B>On Sunday afternoon</B>: Housewarming at a POUM Pioneer House. Like
      many others this house was confiscated by the POUM. It was originally a
      bourgeois country house. The pioneers &mdash; youth between the ages of 10
      and 12 &mdash; made a very lively impression.</P>
    
    <P>After that a housewarming at a POUM library in a part of town called
      Gracia. The library is in a house which was taken over from a Marquis who
      had fled. The Committee of POUM Youth is there, as is comrade Schwarz&#146;s<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#5" NAME="5b">5)</A></SUP>
      office (International Left). Most of the library&#146;s collection comes
      from bourgeois houses in Barcelona, whose property was confiscated. It
      also contains Comrade K&ouml;nig&#146;s<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#6" NAME="6b">6)</A></SUP>
      book collection. The inaugural speech was made in Catalan by a POUM member
      &mdash; a teacher. It stressed the class and Marxist orientation of the
      library and the class nature of all culture. Comrade K&ouml;nig works in
      the library.</P>
    
    <P>In total, about 200 000 workers are supposed to have been called up into
      the army by now. It is estimated that in the rest of Spain the number is
      around 150 000. In any case, it is a smaller number than in Catalonia
      alone. These estimates are from comrades and are not official.</P>
    
    <P>Factories with more than 50 workers have been expropriated (incautado),
      while those with less than 50 have been put under workers&#146; control.
      Some of the smaller factories which produce munitions can be, and have
      been, taken over. Along with the confiscation of the factories goes the
      confiscation of factory capital. There is now a centralised distribution
      of raw materials, fuel, etc, in Catalonia, organised by the Economic
      Council. Foreign owners of factories have been promised compensation, but
      this is of only formal significance as no guarantees have been made as to
      how or when compensation will occur.</P>
    
    <P>In the evening I had a conversation on the state of Catalan agriculture
      with Comrade Sarda, who is supposed to be one of the POUM&#146;s best
      agricultural experts. About 80 per cent of the land is suitable for modern
      mechanical farming methods. About 20 per cent of the land cannot be worked
      mechanically, due to its situation on mountain sides, hilltops, etc.
      Modern methods are also possible in the olive plantations, which are very
      important in Catalonia, and also in vineyards. Cultivating olives needs
      careful attention and plenty of fertiliser, otherwise they yield a small
      crop. Grain production is also very important here. Agricultural
      conditions vary a great deal in the different parts of Catalonia. In the
      area around Barcelona vegetables and fruit are intensively cultivated.</P>
    
    <P>The peasants in this area exported vast amounts, mainly to Britain, and
      were economically quite well off. Large estates predominated in L&eacute;rida
      province, which is now decisively under POUM influence. The other parts of
      Catalonia are mostly made up of small freeholders and tenant farmers.
      There are two types of tenant. First, there are the rabassaires. They
      provide all the equipment themselves and pay one third of the crop to the
      owners. The owners generally have nothing to do with the enterprise and,
      living on their rent collecting, tend to spend their time in caf&eacute;s.
      The second category of tenant is just like the m&eacute;tayers in France.
      The owner provides all the equipment, including half the seed. The tenant
      then gives half the yield to the owner. The rabassaire tenants tend to be
      long-term, between 20 and 30 years, while the m&eacute;tayers are
      short-term and can expect to be left high and dry at any moment.</P>
    
    <P>The revolution immediately gave these tenants the right to all of the
      crop which they produced. The big farms were expropriated and are now
      largely collectively farmed, and the rural workers are helped by
      representatives of the workers&#146; organisations from the towns.</P>
    
    <P>Most of the tenant farmers and small peasants have formed unions,
      sometimes several in one place (CNT, UGT, rabassaires, Anarchists, etc).
      It is now decreed that every locality should only have one union which all
      peasants and rural workers should join. Such a union might be thought of
      as an agricultural cooperative. For the rural workers it is similar to a
      trade union. The union takes care of the communal sale of agricultural
      products, the communal buying of goods for the village cooperative shop,
      and the common use of agricultural equipment, oil-presses, wine making,
      etc. However, the cultivation of the land tends to take place
      individually.</P>
    
    <P>There have been some problems in Catalonia, due to the fact that, under
      the leadership of the lower organs of the CNT, collectivisation of the
      land has been carried out more radically than the farmers themselves
      wanted. The farmers do not agree with many of the orders which have been
      issued. The leading bodies of the CNT have made statements against these
      excesses by the lower levels of the leadership, but they do not seem to be
      wholly capable of eradicating them everywhere. According to the opinions
      of some experts, these excesses must be stopped if the revolution in
      Catalonia is to survive, and ways and means are being devised to deal with
      the situation.</P>
    
    <P>On the question of distribution of food, things look quite different
      from what I expected on the basis of a report I got recently from someone
      returning from Barcelona. In general there is no sign of a lack of food,
      either in the rear areas or at the front. The province of Catalonia grows
      masses of vegetables, fruit oil, grain, etc. The restaurants and the food
      shops have plenty of these goods. In general the workers&#146; standard of
      living has risen since 19 July. Wages are up by 13 per cent. They are paid
      in full even for short-time work. The milicianos at the front get 10
      pesetas a day, and their families in the rear are also taken care of.</P>
    
    <P>There is a certain shortage of potatoes, but this is not very
      significant. More important is the shortage of fresh meat which has
      arisen, because the regions from which most of the meat comes to Catalonia
      have been occupied by the Fascists. There is a lot of fish. There is some
      shortage of charcoal, the normal cooking fuel of Catalonia. The houses
      themselves tend not to be heated, as the climate makes this unnecessary.
      Here and there milk is in short supply. I have been told that many people
      eat in the restaurants because they get meat supplies. The soldiers at the
      front get priority when it comes to the distribution of meat. According to
      those who have just come from there, nourishment at the front is said to
      be very good. The cost of food is much, much lower than in France. In the
      party club a good meal can be had for between two and 2.5 pesetas. Wine
      costs between 40 and 50 cents a litre. There are queues in front of
      butchers and the shops selling cooked beans and peas.</P>
    
    <P>In answer to the question as to why there were relatively few turncoats
      at the front, it was explained to me that this is prevented, above all, by
      the terror which the Fascists use against the relatives of those fighting
      at the front. In spite of this there are still many desertions from the
      Fascist lines. At the front itself oral propaganda is generally shouted
      between the trenches. The Fascists claim that it is they who will carry
      out Socialist policies. Fascist aeroplanes drop propaganda leaflets. I
      have been told of some cases of the Fascists dropping <I>Le Populaire</I>,
      apparently to prove to the milicianos that the French Popular Front
      Government has left them in the lurch. It is estimated that the Fascists
      have shot about 200 000 workers.</P>
    
    <P>Following 19 July all the churches in Barcelona were set on fire. It is
      usually only the interior which is burnt out. We were told that these acts
      of arson fitted in well with the mood of the people. Many priests are
      fighting stubbornly, arms in hand, on Franco&#146;s side. According to the
      milicianos, the military strength of the Falangists in Catalonia is
      thought to be very considerable. They are quite often large farmers who
      have fled, village profiteers, etc, and caciques, who fight all the more
      bitterly, because their whole existence depends on the outcome of the war.</P>
    
    <P>Comrade K&ouml;nig, who was in charge of the German bulletin, has now
      been relieved of this function. The move was prompted by the Trotskyists,
      and some material about the Moscow Trials was used.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#7" NAME="7b">7)</A></SUP>
      Comrade Walter Schwarz is the POUM&#146;s official coordinator of
      international links. In addition to that he has been elected
      organisational leader of the important district of Gracia. To be
      politically effective within the POUM it is essential to be able to speak
      Spanish and at least understand Catalan. Comrade Schwarz&#146;s good
      position within the organisation has something to do with the fact that he
      has been an active member of the POUM for four years and was active at the
      front, and has thus won the confidence of many POUM members and other
      people there.</P>
    
    <P>The leaders of the Catalan troops are very quickly trained in people&#146;s
      military schools. To enter one you must get recommended by a workers&#146;
      organisation. The entire course lasts four months. It is mostly concerned
      with training military leaders for the infantry. A smaller department
      trains those for the artillery. At the end of every four month period
      exams are held. Those who do a one month course are sent to the front as
      group leaders, after two months as non-commissioned officers, after three
      months as sergeants, and after four months as teniente or second
      lieutenants. The training is both theoretical and practical. It involves
      the elements of military tactics. The proletarian composition of these
      military schools is ensured by the way candidates are selected. But the
      number of bourgeois officers at their disposal is very small anyway, and
      is certainly not enough to form a bourgeois officer corps. The creation of
      proletarian military leaders is because of the situation after the revolt
      of 19 July in Catalonia.</P>
    
    <P><B>Tuesday, 24 November 1936</B>: A visit to the weekly market showed
      that there are large quantities of vegetables, fruit, bread, pasta and
      fish available here. It was not particularly busy there. The stalls lacked
      fresh meat. Some prices: mandarins: between 10 and 15 cents per pound &mdash;
      about 400 grams; good grapes: between 30 and 50 cents per pound &mdash;
      about 400 grams. Plenty of bread and butter.</P>
    
    <P>On Monday evening comrades asked me to give a talk on the international
      situation to members of the international group who were about to go to
      the front. Apart from our comrades Heidenreich and Huber, two Austrian
      soldiers and two Swiss were present. Naturally I spoke about Popular Front
      policies, particularly in France. The comrades explained that they were
      sorely lacking in political information at the front, and that the
      political commissars did virtually nothing in this respect. They requested
      that I or somebody else give lectures for a few weeks directly behind the
      front lines, and they assured me that there would be a lot of interest (I
      did not have enough time to take them up on this.) Political propaganda at
      the front is largely limited to providing milicianos with newspapers.
      These are sent every day without fail. Moreover, it is said that even
      amongst members of the POUM at the front, the contradiction between the
      attitude of the POUM in <I>La Batalla</I> to the Soviet Union and the
      soldiers&#146; gratitude for Russian arms is noticeable.</P>
    
    <P><B>Wednesday, 25 November 1936</B>: On Tuesday I attended a session of
      the People&#146;s Court, at which the POUM member, whom I met at the
      Executive Committee, was acting as fiscal. The trial took place in a room
      at the Palace of Justice. The court seemed thoroughly proletarian in its
      composition and attitudes. The bourgeois judge obviously tried to fit his
      behaviour to that of the workers. A doctor was on trial. He was accused of
      treating a Republican officer wounded in the revolt with injections in
      such a way that he knew that he would most certainly die. A number of
      testimonies were given. There was no conclusive proof. The accused was
      freed. The audience was mainly composed of workers. There were also some
      doctors. The public took an active part in the proceedings, but were also
      very dignified at all times. The fiscal really did lead the proceedings. A
      lawyer defended the accused, putting questions to witnesses.</P>
    
    <P><B>Thursday, 26 November 1936</B>: On Wednesday morning I visited a
      POUM barracks, a former cavalry barracks, kitted out with modern fittings
      in airy rooms. The barracks </P>
    
    <P>are for training milicianos.</P>
    
    <P>At Nin&#146;s: arranged to meet on Saturday morning at 10am. Car ride to
      the Barcelona hills. In the evening I had a discussion with Comrade Sarda
      about the organisation of agriculture outside Catalonia. I gleaned from
      his remarks that it is impossible to tell what has actually happened.
      Talking about Valencia, he said that not only the large farms but also the
      smaller ones had been collectivised. In general it seems that in the
      regions of Spain around Catalonia people have gone much further than the
      stated intentions of the government in Madrid. A clear solution to the
      agrarian problem does not exist in the rest of Spain. The comrade reported
      that, in some cases, with a too radical political leadership on the
      smallholding question, there have been a few cases of peasants shooting
      the &#145;new caciques&#146;, and in other cases there has been sabotage
      on the land. The question is how this can be put right. This must be
      regarded as a very important matter.</P>
    
    <P>The press reported the arrest of the police chief, who belonged to the
      Esquerra. <I>Solidaridad Obrera</I> is attempting to suggest that it was
      a purely criminal matter, but from other press statements it can be seen
      that it has something to do with the political manoeuvring of a section of
      the Estat Catala (the military wing of the Esquerra). These endeavours
      obviously have something to do with separatist and counter-revolutionary
      tendencies. The public were only given vague hints, perhaps because the
      investigation was not yet finished. Checa people have arrested a number of
      people in connection with this, and have apparently been quite busy.</P>
    
    <P>Sarda has this to report about the composition of the PSUC. Less than a
      third of its members are former Communists. The majority come from the
      bourgeois left. On many matters the PSUC is to the right of the Esquerra.</P>
    
    <P><B>Friday, 27 November 1936</B>: In the morning I visited some of the
      poor districts of the city. They are reminiscent of the worst part of the
      harbour district in Marseilles. In the evening there was a meeting of the
      POUM in the Gracia district. Agenda: report on organisational questions.
      Members were called up through their cells. Excluding those who were
      prevented from attending because they had to take part in some sort of
      party task, virtually everyone was present. The district has 200 members. 
      Twenty are old ones, that is members from before the revolt. One hundred
      and eighty have joined since June. This is clearly typical. The membership
      is largely young.</P>
    
    <P>There was a report on trade union work, local projects and work in the
      schools, and a number of organisational questions were tackled. The
      reports were short. There was a discussion after each one. At the end some
      complaints were made about the fact that the local committee had not yet
      replied in writing to suggestions from the districts. It was explained
      that this was mainly due to them being pushed for time. Comrades were
      asked to accept oral replies. Comrade Schwarz was made organisational
      leader of the district, which met with general approval. Sarda is the
      political leader.</P>
    
    <P>In the meantime Gorkin and Andrade of the Executive have returned from
      Madrid. They had been there to settle a dispute to do with the Madrid POUM
      column. Gorkin, whom I met at the Executive Committee of the POUM, was
      very optimistic about the military situation in Madrid. The entire
      civilian population of the city is being evacuated. In Barcelona itself
      children have been arriving from Madrid and have been warmly greeted by
      the locals. Gorkin invited me to the editorial offices of <I>La Batalla</I>
      for a discussion this afternoon.</P>
    
    <P><B>Saturday, 28 November 1936</B>: At 10am I had a discussion with Nin.
      First of all I enquired as to the long term political perspectives for the
      government in Catalonia. He answered that at the moment it was impossible
      to see in precisely what way they could establish a workers&#146; and
      peasants&#146; government. Most interesting was what Nin had to say about
      the ways in which the continual political shifts among the rank and file
      express themselves in the leadership.</P>
    
    <P>This happens through the trade unions. According to Nin the workers are
      100 per cent trade unionised. Following the shifts in influence of the
      political parties in the trade unions, the committees, which exercise
      power in the localities in Catalonia, change their composition in the same
      proportion. All political questions are discussed in the trade unions, and
      delegates are chosen according to the attitudes of the rank and file. It
      is also quite often the case that in areas where, for example, the POUM is
      strongest, even the CNT and UGT delegates represent POUM positions and
      feel like POUM representatives, even though they are not members of the
      organisation. According to this description the trade unions are the broad
      bodies through which proletarian democracy is put into effect. It can thus
      be seen that when, for example, the ratio of representatives of the
      various organisations is fixed in any locality, its real political
      composition alters in line with the attitudes of the rank and file.</P>
    
    <P>It is for this reason that the POUM has expended so much energy
      attempting to win over the UGT. Their former party trade union entered it.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#8" NAME="8b">8)</A></SUP>
      They maintain that, despite the bureaucracy of the PSUC and the Social
      Democrats, who have put all kinds of obstacles in their path, they are in
      a good position to win the leadership of the UGT. One of the PSUC&#146;s
      tricks is to allow into the unions all kinds of petit-bourgeois elements,
      people who have nothing to do with trade unions.</P>
    
    <P>The POUM is also active in the CNT. They stand for a merger of the CNT
      and the UGT, and, according to them, this will soon be a reality.
      According to Nin&#146;s account, which is backed up by Arquer and others,
      it is just not true that the representatives of the leading political
      committees are simply named by the party political leadership. They are
      elected by the membership, or the membership must agree with the
      selection. In any case the political development of the masses organised
      in trade unions &mdash; and that is equivalent to the entire working class &#151;
      is reflected in the composition or the political position of the
      committee. This is a proletarian democracy (which is also the start of the
      proletarian dictatorship), whose organ is primarily the trade unions.</P>
    
    <P>Nin was very critical of the PSUC. The PSUC and the Esquerra tend to
      hang around together. The CNT informed him that the PSUC sent them a
      confidential letter containing the following demands:</P>
    <OL CLASS="numbered">
      <LI> Full dictatorial powers for the government </LI>
      <LI> Exclusion of the POUM from the government. </LI>
      <LI> Abolition of the junta de defensa and all bodies through which the
        workers&#146; organisations carry out their control over the armed
        forces at the front and in the rear. </LI>
    </OL>
    
    <P>Even the CNT, as well as the UGT members, strongly opposed this
      statement and rejected it.</P>
    
    <P>Nin also gave a report of a conference or meeting of government members
      after the October celebrations, whereby, quite characteristically,
      Companys is said to have called for a Socialist republic, whilst
      Antonov-Ovseyenko,<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#9" NAME="9b">9)</A></SUP>
      the consular representative of the Soviet Union, came out in favour of a
      bourgeois republic.</P>
    
    <P>Moreover, Nin told me of an article which Antonov-Ovseyenko sent to the
      Barcelona press denouncing an article in <I>La Batalla</I>. He described
      the POUM as Fascistic. On the following Sunday, Nin and some other POUM
      spokesmen publicly and sharply replied to this attack.</P>
    
    <P>Nin says the Esquerra should not be taken for a liberal bourgeois party.
      There are no elements of the big bourgeoisie in their ranks but, rather,
      peasants, petit-bourgeois and a considerable number of workers &mdash;
      professional workers. It would be more appropriate to compare the Esquerra
      to the Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party.</P>
    
    <P>On the question of the international working class movement, Nin&#146;s
      position can be summed up by the following:</P>
    <OL CLASS="numbered">
      <LI> He admits that the Brussels conference was a flop. </LI>
      <LI> At the international conference in Barcelona the ideological basis
        for a new International should be worked out, but the time is not yet
        ripe for its immediate formation. </LI>
      <LI> In reply to the question of what does he imagine the relationship of
        a new International to the Soviet Union may be, he said that he thought
        that a victory in Spain &#145;through its effect on France and other
        countries, could alter the internal regime of the Soviet Union&#146;. A
        reform of the Comintern would only be imaginable if &#145;Stalin were to
        take a walk&#146;. </LI>
    </OL>
    
    <P>Nin was evasive in response to my suggestion of financial payment from
      the POUM for our propaganda. He said that the party was currently
      stocktaking the goods which they had confiscated. It seems that they have
      come across a lot of things of little worth. Of course, I did not pursue
      the matter any further.</P>
    
    <P>Characteristic of Nin&#146;s attitude to the Soviet Union was his remark
      that the workers have less freedom of expression there than in Hitler&#146;s
      Germany. We both agreed that we were divided by totally opposing attitudes
      to the Soviet Union.</P>
    
    <P><B>Sunday, 30 November 1936</B>: A discussion with POUM representatives
      on the Economic Council. Factories with over 50 workers have been
      collectivised. Those with less than 50 are under workers&#146; control.</P>
    
    <P>The PSUC, as a front for the Esquerra, supports compensation for
      expropriated owners. The POUM and the CNT reject compensation completely.
      (Compensation would be paid out in some sort of promissory notes, which
      would yield an interest rate of three or four per cent.)</P>
    
    <P>Factories with fewer than 50 workers can also be collectivised if they
      are important for the war effort, or if the owner has fled. Small
      employers quite often continue to work in their factories as employees.
      Decisions about production are made by the staff, though in some cases
      they have to approved by the Economic Council.</P>
    
    <P>At the head of each industry is an Industrial Board, made up of four
      UGT, four CNT, four representatives from factory councils, and one
      delegate from the government. These are the main problems being faced at
      the moment:</P>
    <OL CLASS="numbered">
      <LI> The supply of raw materials, especially cotton and coal. </LI>
      <LI> The difficulties of selling the goods of some industries because of
        the collapse of the Spanish market and the paralysis of foreign trade.
      </LI>
      <LI> Small businessmen are getting credit to pay wages, but are having
        problems getting money to buy the necessary raw materials. </LI>
      <LI> Many workers tend to treat the factory as the particular property of
        the employees. In future the profits or gains of all factories will be
        pooled so that the deficit firms can be supported by the surplus profits
        of the others. </LI>
    </OL>
    
    <P>The POUM delegate did not want an inflation of the economy but it
      appears inevitable. He told us in confidence that the Basque government
      has let it be known that they will not stand for any expropriation of
      firms and factories in the Basque country as has happened in Catalonia.</P>
    
    <P><B>Monday, 1 December 1936</B>: Some of the streets with saints&#146;
      names were renamed after POUM people who have fallen. Arquer gave a little
      speech at each street. There was a procession with music, flags, etc. The
      widows of the fallen men were there dressed in mourning.</P>
    
    <P>Finally a public meeting in a large theatre. Nin, Arquer and Solano<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#10" NAME="10b">10)</A></SUP>
      spoke, as did McGovern from the ILP, and a man from the SAP. Nin replied
      to the attacks on <I>La Batalla</I> and the POUM by the Soviet consul
      Antonov-Ovseyenko to the sound of mighty applause from the auditorium. The
      meeting was very lively.</P>
    
    <P>In the afternoon a trip to L&eacute;rida in the POUM car with Walter
      Schwarz and Sarda. Drove past Montserrat. The countryside round Barcelona
      has been turned into gardens for market gardening and fruit orchards.
      Arrived at L&eacute;rida at about 8pm. We ate in a huge old nunnery which
      had been taken over by the town council as a canteen for milicianos and
      deserters from the Fascists. The catering had been well organised and
      there was plenty of food, potatoes, fresh meat, wine, etc.</P>
    
    <P>Later on we went to a POUM bar. It is in the former club building of the
      Rightist party, very nicely decorated and in the centre of town.
      Downstairs is a caf&eacute; where milicianos and party comrades have
      lively discussions. The POUM dominates the town and province of L&eacute;rida.
      It has predominantly textile industries. Several burnt out churches. There
      is a lot of bustle on the streets. Lots of movement to and from the front.
      The party secretary is a young man in his early 30s.</P>
    
    <P>There were two regiments in the town made up mainly of farmers&#146;
      sons from the surrounding area. The officers had been preparing an
      uprising in L&eacute;rida, but waited for the result of the battle for
      Barcelona before they came out. After the defeat in Barcelona they did not
      dare to crack down. Two hundred officers and leading lights of the right
      were shot, and the soldiers were demobbed. Initially only workers were
      sent to the front. Now, soldiers, too, are called up.</P>
    
    <P>We were quartered in the Palace Hotel. It is clean and in good
      condition. Breakfast &mdash; one peseta. The POUM is in control of the UGT,
      which is dominant in L&eacute;rida. The CNT is weak in L&eacute;rida.</P>
    
    <P><B>Tuesday 2 December 1936</B>: In the morning visited &#145;Good
      Homeland&#146;, about 20 kilometres from L&eacute;rida. This property
      consists of several thousand hectares. There are large vineyards which
      produced between 5000 and 6000 hectolitres of wine this year. There are
      timber plantations (poplars) for the paper industry, and corn fields. Even
      before the uprising there was a POUM rural workers&#146; group of around
      30 members. About 150 people are employed on the farm. After the uprising
      the property was confiscated and collectivised. The POUM sent five people
      to help run the place. They have a former accountant here, a POUM member
      from Barcelona. The different branches of production have workers&#146;
      commissions in charge. Wine is produced using modern methods &mdash;
      hydraulic presses made in Germany, huge cement cisterns, distillation
      equipment which manufacture alcohol from hops, cooling equipment, chemical
      laboratories, etc. Every year between 5000 and 6000 litres of alcohol are
      produced, </P>
    
    <P>The wages of rural workers have been raised to between seven and 10
      pesetas a day. There is a shop and a caf&eacute;, both run by workers. The
      owner had built a huge church for one and a half million pesetas on the
      farm. This is now used as a silo. Nuns used to teach at the school, but
      they have been kicked out and replaced by a secular teacher.</P>
    
    <P>The farm house is an old castle with a high tower, from which a view
      stretches far into the distance. It is very modern inside. The rural
      workers live in miserable little houses, each with a tiny back garden.
      They will be rebuilt next year. Most of the furniture stayed in the
      castle, excluding the material that was sent to the front &mdash; beds and
      so on. You get the impression that the farm is successful under the new
      regime too. Difficulties could arise because only a tiny amount of capital
      (80 000 pesetas) was confiscated along with the farm. The owner was one of
      the big bourgeoisie and owned some more property near Barcelona, where
      some of the wine from the &#145;Good Homeland&#146; was made into
      sparkling wine.</P>
    
    <P>The farm continues to produce the usual sparkling wine, red wine (tinto)
      and, from special grapes (16 to 18 grad) the so-called vino rancio, a wine
      which is exposed to sunlight for long periods of time. According to the
      farm director, it is not from wine production that the greatest return is
      yielded but rather from the cereal harvest. Some of the cattle were handed
      over for the front. The management of the farm is based on a system of
      mutual agreement and is directed by the Economic Council of the
      government. The farm has not been split up. I was told that much of the
      surrounding land was made up of similar large businesses, and that it was
      unnecessary to divide up the farm.</P>
    
    <P><B>Tuesday evening</B>: Left Barcelona. Reached Figueras at 12 o&#146;clock.
      Left Figueras early on Wednesday morning, crossed at Port-Bou to reach
      Perpignan. The French customs offices are about a kilometre from Port-Bou
      towards Cerb&egrave;re. The French Customs were obviously quite
      sympathetic to the cause, as there was no customs search and just a brief
      passport control. In the clear sunlight we could see the snow covered
      mountains of the Pyrenees outside Perpignan, and below them vineyards,
      huge timber plantations, etc. On the journey from Port-Bou to Cerb&egrave;re
      and from Cerb&egrave;re to Perpignan many of the labourers who were
      working on the roads and so on greeted the car with a clenched fist.
      Reached Perpignan at 2.43. Paris Thursday morning at seven o&#146;clock.</P>

      Ewald K&ouml;nig (1894-1945) was a teacher and a member of the KPO. He
      joined the Socialist movement in the early 1920s, and from there the KPD.
      Expelled as a supporter of Brandler in 1929, he left Germany for France
      upon Hitler&#146;s accession to power. During the Spanish Civil War he ran

      by the Stalinist secret police in one of their private prisons for his
      support for the POUM. He was released after three months, and then
      returned to France, where he was interned in 1939. He died of pneumonia

      The reference here is to the first of the Moscow Trials, in which
      Zinoviev, Kamenev and others were accused of being accomplices of Trotsky.
      The attitude of the Brandlerites was to accept the validity of the
      accusations, which led to the removal of K&ouml;nig from his position as
      the editor of the German language bulletin of the POUM. In April 1937 a
      group of about 25 Trotskyists left the POUM to set up the Spanish
      Bolshevik-Leninists, a section of the international Trotskyist movement,
      with the paper <I>La Voz Leninista</I>.</P>
