<H4>Introduction by Mike Jones</H4>
    
   
    <P>The article below was first published in the 3 January 1930 issue of
      <I>Gegen den Strom</I>, It was apparently written both to mark the
      celebration of the 'Three Ls' (Lenin, Luxemburg and Liebknecht') on 15
      January 1930 and also to counter crude attacks on Luxemburg by those
      leaders of the German Communist Party (KPD) who were undertaking the final
      Stalinisation of the party in the aftermath of the adoption of the
      Comintern's ultra-left 'new line'. By then many of Luxemburg's associates,
      who had founded and built up the party, had been expelled and were
      organised in the KPD (Opposition), whose theoretical weekly <I>Gegen den
      Strom </I>was. The Luxemburg tradition had come under attack earlier,
      under the Ruth Fischer-Arkadi Maslow leadership, allies of Zinoviev, who
      began the so-called 'Bolshevisation' of the KPD, uprooting the native
      democratic structures and adopting one resulting from the Russian
      experience - almost destroying the party in the process, because of the
      linked sectarian politics. Luxemburg, Trotsky and Brandler<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#1" NAME="1b">1)</A></SUP> were all
      compared and denounced as 'semi-Mensheviks', etc.</P>
    
    <P>Walter Held's essay in the last <I>What Next? </I>would seem to stem
      from that tradition that thought the Bolsheviks had found all the answers.
      I see that outlook as ahistorical. As August Thalheimer points out, it was
      not a result of an 'error' that Rosa Luxernburg opposed centralism in
      Germany, but because of the level of capitalist development, the level of
      class struggle, and the corresponding forms of the labour movement thrown
      up by the workers themselves. In Russia and Poland, the level of
      capitalist development and of the class struggle, and the need for
      secrecy, all meant that the nascent movement was dominated by the
      intellectuals, with only a few advanced workers prepared to follow them.
      The organisations they set up were by nature of the Blanquist type. The
      1903 dispute over the Russian Social Democratic and Labour Party statutes
      reflects that.</P>
    
    <P>The organisational form adopted by the workers' organisations expressed
      the needs of the distinct stage of development. In Germany, Rosa Luxemburg
      fought the centralism of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). as this was
      allowing the party to move away from the advanced workers and into class
      collaboration. For her, the workers' party, rust be able to respond to the
      creative deeds of the revolutionary workers, to integrate into its arsenal
      their new conceptions, and to theorise such novel creations. The top-down
      centralised party cannot respond to such creative acts. It operates
      according to schemas drafted by all-powerful Central Committees. Witness
      the Bolshevik response to the 1905 events.</P>
    
    <P>In accordance with her analysis of capitalist development - as set out
      in her <I>The Accumulation of Capital </I>- Rosa Luxemburg assumed that,
      as capitalism developed, its contradictions sharpened. The class struggle
      would increase accordingly and the working class would gradually
      radicalise, resulting in the SPI) shedding the petty bourgeois element and
      becoming the pure workers' party required, as the radicalised workers
      began to determine its policy and tactics. For her, it was not the party
      that brought revolutionary consciousness to the working class, but the
      workers, becoming conscious through the actual struggles they undertook,
      who then brought their conceptions into the party. The party then reworks
      these discoveries into its programme and theory. Luxemburg saw the role of
      the party as that of raising the existing consciousness of the class, not
      as arriving from outside and imposing ready-made schemas.</P>
    
    <P>For example, the 'Open Letter' of January 1921, where the KPI) advanced
      demands around which a United Front could materialise, came from the
      Stuttgart Demands, put forward by KPI) metalworkers in that area; and
      they, in turn, originated in a discussion of the W&uuml;rttemberg District
      Conunittee of the KPD, at which Brandler and Walcher were present.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#2" NAME="2b">2)</A></SUP> The
      point being that W&uuml;rttemberg had been a stronghold of Spartakus, key
      KPD leaders came from there, and a layer of workers existed who had been
      schooled in Luxemburg's understanding of Marxism. Hence the demands came
      not from the top down, but from that reciprocal relationship between the
      party and class.</P>
    
    <P>Luxernburg's struggle, waged over the years within the SPD, meant that
      she understood that reformism and centrism had deep material roots, that
      the removal of a few leaders was no solution, that these historical
      leaders had a following, even if, to a degree, this was based on
      illusions. No, the 4 August events resulted from a long historical
      process. Therefore she opposed any break from the SPD until no more could
      be done (and she was correct to oppose Lenin at Zimmerwald - as was
      Trotsky), as a small group of intellectuals and a tiny sector of advanced
      workers would have only separated themselves from the organised workers'
      movement by a split, and made difficult the task of influencing those same
      workers, by participating in and influencing the process whereby they
      became aware of the need either to take over the old party or to found a
      new one. For Luxemburg, as for Marx, the emergence of the party does not
      result from the will of the intellectuals but from the conscious decision
      of the working class, out of a stage in its development, and out of the
      class struggle itself. Everything else is sect-building,</P>
    
    <P>Hence it was no 'error' of Luxemburg to have neglected to split long
      before. August Thalheimer's phrase 'schoolboy notion' sums up such a view.
      That view is still current in some of the sects today. Another one, just
      as erroneous, is that she should have created a 'hard faction' in the SPD.
      To what end? As long as Luxemburg and her comrades had freedom of speech,
      could operate freely, could not only publish in but even edit local
      newspapers, could run local and district SPI) organisations, in other
      words have normal rights as party members - then why set up secret
      groupings? A current of opinion suffices in such circumstances. Secret
      groups can only alienate other comrades and cut oneself off from
      influencing them.</P>
    
    <P>Years later, looking back, Thalheimer wrote: 'Still in 1914-15, we did
      not exclude the possibility of being able to still raise the flag of
      revolution within the Social Democracy and cleansing it of opportunist
      elements. Only gradually did we become convinced that within this old
      framework there was nothing more to expect, nothing more to gain. One must
      be clear, however, that inside the Social Democratic Party the severe
      factional struggles between the Lassalleans and Eisenachers were still
      fixed in the memory, the idea of a split met with the most difficult
      obstructions and the most grave hesitations among even the most
      progressive workers.&#146;<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#3" NAME="3b">3)</A></SUP></P>
    
    <P>In Chapter 5 of his Rosa <I>Luxemburg </I>biography, Paul Fr&ouml;1ich
      evaluates our two protagonists, and although he has been accused of
      smoothing out the differences, it seem to me that, within the framework of
      the task he was set, he does face up to them. On the original argument
      over the type of party (1904), Fr&ouml;lich says that Luxemburg 'observed
      in him [Lenin] a dangerous rigidity in argumentation, a certain
      scholasticism in his political ideas, and a tendency to ignore the living
      movement of the masses, or even to coerce it into accepting preconceived
      tactical plans'.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#4" NAME="4b">4)</A></SUP> But he goes on to say: 'In any case, when big
      decisions had to be taken, he demonstrated a tactical elasticity which one
      would not have suspected from his writings. His associates, however,
      manifested that conservative inertia, as decried by Rosa Luxemburg.<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#5" NAME="5b">5)</A></SUP>
      Summing up that first difference, Fr&ouml;lich concludes that: 'Luxemburg
      underestimated the power of organisation, particularly when the reins of
      leadership were in the hands of her opponents. She relied all too
      believingly on the pressure of the revolutionary masses to make any
      correction in party policy. Lenin's total political view prior to 1917
      shows traces of unmistakeably Blanquist influences and an exaggerated
      voluntarism, though he quickly overcame it when faced with concrete
      situations ... it can be said that Rosa concerned herself more with the
      historical process as a whole and derived her political decisions from it,
      while Lenin's eye was more concentrated on the final aim and sought the
      means to bring it about. For her the decisive element was the mass., for
      him it was the party, which he wanted to forge into the spearhead of the
      whole movement.'<SUP CLASS="anote"><A HREF="#6" NAME="6b">6)</A></SUP></P>
    
    <P>Fr&ouml;lich looks at Luxernburg's approach to the party during the war
      in Chapter 11, and adequately outlines her reasoning. In Chapter 12, he
      does the came regarding her attitude in 1917 and the deeds of the
      Bolsheviks. Thalheimer does not deal with the questions of democracy or
      the terror, so I'll restrict myself to a few comments only. In her
      unfinished brochure on the Russian Revolution, Luxemburg spoke up for 'the
      dictatorship of <I>the class, </I>not of a party or of a clique'. She
      also criticised the Bolsheviks justifying the measures they took, and even
      theoretising them, when they went counter to the Marxist programme. If we
      know that these measures were adopted ad hoc because of civil war and
      counter-revolution, we also know today where they led. Such measures
      became part and parcel of what passed for Communist theory. It seems to me
      that Luxemburg was correct here.</P>
    
    <P>In a number of quotes from Luxemburg's brochure, Fr&ouml;lich sums up
      how she saw the role of the masses, as opposed to Lenin-Trotsky, and she
      wrote that: 'Socialist practice demands a total spiritual transformation
      in the masses ('ganze geistige Umw&auml;lzung' - the untranslatable
      'geistige' can also mean 'mental', 'intellectual', etc.), and to me that
      sums up Luxemburg. For her the downtrodden masses had become conscious of
      the need to take power and emancipate themselves; that a party based on
      Marxism was pushing them aside and saying 'leave things to us' was
      incomprehensible. For me she represents more the Marxism of Marx, while
      Lenin (Trotsky became a Bolshevik and rejected his old criticism) has
      strong Blanquist traits that surely originate in the Russian populist
      tradition. A serious debate on these old arguments is welcome, and here I
      agree with Thalheimer, that one should reject the either/or, thereby
      constructing false poles, but approach the matters historically, and today
      with the benefit of much hindsight.</P>

    <H2>Rosa Luxemburg or Lenin?</H2>
    
    <H1>August Thalheimer</H1>
    
    <P>0n the 15 January, the revolutionary working class in Germany celebrates
      <I>simultaneously </I>Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and Lenin. In the
      imagination and the sentiment of the German revolutionary worker they
      stand on the same level, as the hitherto greatest champions of the
      proletarian revolution. Each of them with their own traits, their own
      achievements, their own revolutionary character, their own role. The name
      of Lenin shines in the clear lustre of the victor of the first proletarian
      revolution and its convulsive and infectious impact worldwide. The names
      of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht are surrounded by the gloomy lustre
      of the leaders of a revolution that was crushed in its first assault, of
      the martyrs of the revolutionary struggle, of the most outstandmig symbols
      of the arduous path of martyrdom and suffering, but also of the unbending
      fighting spirit of the German working class. If the former personifies the
      victorious present and true reality of the proletarian revolution, then
      the latter personify its future, its hope, its intention to break through
      to the advanced capitalist west. All three are equally dear to the hearts
      of the revolutionary working class.</P>
    
    <P>Only the minor and ambitious fellows today at work on the shoulders of
      these giants, in dull ignorance, m order to misrepresent, to pervert and
      demolish what the others built up, now reserve the right to put the
      question: 'Luxemburg <I>or </I>Lenin?' And they decide it so: Rosa
      Luxemburg became stuck on the way to Bolshevism (the name Communism is
      apparently no longer sufficient), at centrism or semi-centrism, so to
      speak, that she was a - fortunately outmoded - stage towards the height to
      which these fellows have raised themselves.</P>
    
    <P>It would, however, be just as wrong to counter-pose to this mistake the
      opposite one, that 'Luxemburgism' is the superior revolutionary doctrine
      to Leninism.</P>
    
    <P>Not Luxemburg <I>or </I>Lenin - but Luxemburg <I>and </I>Lenin. Here
      it is not a question of an obscure mixture and obliteration of
      differences, but of recognising the particular role and significance of
      each of them for the proletarian revolution. Each of them gave the
      proletarian revolution something the other did not, and could not, give.
      The reasons can be found in the different historical role of the
      revolutionary movements in which they were, above all, rooted and which
      they, above all, influenced.</P>
    
    <P>Firstly, we take the general conception of the proletarian revolution.
      Out of genuine revolutionary Marxism, both Rosa Luxemburg and also Lenin
      rescued <I>the general conception of the proletarian dictatorship </I>and
      the role of revolutionary violence within it. Rosa Luxemburg championed
      this conception first in the West not only against the revisionism of
      Bernstein, but also against Kautsky, against the 'Marxist Centre' -
      obviously so named because it tore the revolutionary centre from the
      Marxist conception of the proletarian revolution, by dispelling the
      proletarian dictatorship and <I>limiting </I>the revolutionary struggle
      to the democratic-parliamentary-trade union struggle.</P>
    
    <P>The essence of the Marxist Centre, of Kautskyism, took shape in the
      years in which the struggle of the proletariat for power was felt to be
      approaching, and it implied that what was only a certain period in the
      struggle of the German and Western proletariat, the parliamentary and
      trade union struggle for reforms, was an absolute, the one and only way.
      Kautskyist thought faltered before the dialectical transformation of the
      method of struggle for reform into that of the <I>immediate revolutionary
      </I>struggle. For the whole of Marxism it substituted the <I>fragment,
      </I>which parliamentary-trade unionist struggle of the German social
      democracy during the years 1870-1914 embodied. Consequently, when history
      really posed the question of the proletarian revolution during the
      imperialist world war, Kautskyism sank back into social -pacifism and
      vulgar democracy, and vulgar democracy turned into naked
      counterrevolution.</P>
    
    <P>Bernstein and Kautsky, the 'Siamese Twins', the poles of the same vulgar
      democratic and semi-Marxist narrow-mindedness, today logically find
      themselves together again on the basis of the same conception.</P>
    
    <P>In opposition to them, Rosa Luxemburg rescued the whole, and thereby the
      true, conception of Marxism, due to the fact that she saw far beyond the
      German and Western European sector of the proletarian struggle and
      therefore also in time beyond the purely parliamentary and purely trade
      union period.</P>
    
    <P>However, she was no more able than Marx and Engels, or anyone else
      however ingenious, to anticipate out of the depths of the mind,
      discoveries and creations which only the struggle of the proletarian
      masses itself was able to accomplish. Bureaucrats of the revolution may
      imagine that they can replace the creative power of the historical process
      of the revolution (yet in reality it only results in powerless
      caricatures). As long as the proletarian revolution had not assumed a real
      form anywhere, the conception of the proletarian revolution could not go
      beyond the degree of precision conceived by Marx and Engels from out of
      the French Commune, i.e. it had to remain standing at a still very general
      and abstract conception.</P>
    
    <P>An important and decisive step beyond that was first taken by the
      revolutionary Marxist leader of the working class who stood closest to the
      Russian revolution of 1905-6 and therefore knew how to fully evaluate its
      results theoretically. This role fell to Lenin. From the 1905-6 revolution
      he conceived the idea of the significance of the councils as the embryo of
      proletarian state power and in connection with the 1917 revolution as the
      <I>concrete _fundamental form of the state of the proletarian
      dictatorship.</I></P>
    
    <P>The true creator of this form is the revolutionary working class itself.
      Lenin's epoch-making accomplishment consists in recognising the general
      significance and historical importance of this form faster, more sharply
      and more profoundly than anyone else, and in having drawn
      practical-revolutionary conclusions from this perception.</P>
    
    <P>Following a different direction, Lenin concretised the conception, and
      with that also the plan and strategy, of the proletarian revolution: with
      regard to the relation between the proletarian, the agrarian-peasant and
      the national revolution. The powerful experimental field of three Russian
      revolutions also produced the illustrative material for that. (In
      Trotsky's description, in his <I>'An Attempt at an Autobiography'</I>,
      all that remains in semi-darkness, which might be agreeable for him, but
      is harmful for historical knowledge.)</P>
    
    <P>As soon as the German revolution approached in 1918, Rosa Luxeinburg and
      Karl Lieblenecht, Franz Mehring, Leo Jogiches, and those united with them
      in the Spartakusbund, at once accepted this conception as their
      standpoint, and they knew how to use it <I>with complete independence,
      </I>in a country with substantially different class relations. In a
      country where the working class did not constitute a small minority of the
      population as in Russia, but the majority. Where the anti-feudal agrarian
      revolution had already been completed. Where capitalism had attained its
      highest level of development. Where the working class had for decades been
      used to broad mass organisations, etc.</P>
    
    <P>Neither 'centrists' nor 'semi-centrists', not even mere pupils, not to
      mention bureaucratic subordinates of a bureaucratic supreme authority of
      the proletarian revolution, were capable of that task; only independent
      revolutionary brains could accomplish it. The outcome of these
      achievements, which continue the work of the Russian revolution on German
      ground, is the Spartakus Programme, is the <I>Rote Fahne </I>up to the
      deaths of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht.</P>
    
    <P>In the bureaucratic regions of the KPD it has become customary to
      attribute to a subjective 'error' on Rosa Luxemburg's part, that in
      November 1918 the Spartakusbund was not yet a strong mass party but only a
      numerically weak tendency in transition to wards a party. According to
      this conception, she already 'failed' to 'split' in 1914 or 1915, or even
      as early as 1903. This schoolboy notion fails to grasp that the conditions
      for the building of a revolutionary party out of an already existing mass
      party, which assembles within it the most progressive elements of the
      working class, are different from those where such a mass party and mass
      organisations do not yet exist, but where the task is to build the
      revolutionary core to which the unorganised proletarian masses then
      adhere. That was, however, the different situation in Russia.</P>
    
    <P>Regarding the <I>national question, </I>Rosa Luxemburg's consistent
      struggle in Poland against petty bourgeois nationalism remains a merit not
      disputed by Lenin. Her theoretical generalisation was mistaken. Lenin
      correctly accomplished it out of the great Russian experience.</P>
    
    <P>Regarding the <I>agrarian question, </I>too, the different conceptions
      can be wholly explained by the different conditions. Where feudal or
      semi-feudal agrarian relations in the countryside still have to be
      overcome, as in Russia, but also in a series of other countries, the
      transitional stage in which the generalisation and levelling of the
      individual peasant holdings is unavoidable. However, on the other hand,
      the later Russian experience shows that the construction of socialist
      industry came very quickly into intolerable contradiction with the
      continued existence of the individual peasant holding, and that socialist
      industry must be supplemented by large-scale socialist enterprise on the
      land. Yet it goes without saying that from this general necessity it does
      not follow that this step can be made <I>at any moment </I>but that
      certain real preconditions must met. Trotsky erred in this question by
      ignoring these real preconditions. He erred moreover by not understanding
      that this transition could only be carried out not <I>against </I>but
      only together <I>with </I>the great majority of the small and the middle
      peasants. If it is correct that the transitional stage of the poor
      peasantry in Russia could not be skipped over, then it is just as true
      that under different conditions the aim of the large socialist
      agricultural enterprise can be attained in other shortened stages and in
      part by other means.</P>
    
    <P>In the proletarian revolution too, indeed quite particularly in it, the
      historical dialectic makes itself felt, in that the very same method
      causes transformations in opposite directions depending on the different
      preconditions and that for the same purposes under different circumstances
      occasionally contrary means and methods are called for.</P>
    
    <P>Some questions of the revolutionary organisation may serve as an
      example. In Russia, Lenin posed the question of the strictest
      revolutionary centralisation at first against the Mensheviks, in a
      situation where it was a matter of clearly distinguishing between the
      elements of the proletarian and the bourgeois revolution. The loose form
      of revolutionary organisation favoured by the Mensheviks was the
      organisational expression of the dominance of bourgeois-revolutionary
      intellectual elements, whereas strictest centralisation was the
      organisational expression of the proletarian revolutionary class character
      of the movement.</P>
    
    <P>How different to Germany before the war! The sharpest form of
      organisational centralisation here was represented by the party
      bureaucracy, more or less corroded by opportunism. The rule of the
      opportunist tendency expressed itself organisationally by the domination
      of a strictly centralist, opportunist party apparatus. Against that the
      task was to appeal to the <I>revolutionary self-activity of the members.
      </I>In Russia the principle of strict centralisation was bound up with the
      proletarian-revolutionary tendency, while it was the opposite in Germany,
      where this was the principle of the
      opportunist-petty-bourgeois-bureaucratic tendency. The same formal
      organisational principle in fact combined contradictory contents regarding
      both the direction and, in the last analysis, class objectives. In
      Germany, therefore, the first task was to attack the
      opportunist-reformist-parliamentary centralism, to smash it, in order to
      create the preconditions for revolutionary centralisation. A classical
      dialectical course of development: from the opportunist centralisation
      through its abolition to the revolutionary centralisation.</P>
    
    <P>However, revolutionary centralisation, too, in its turn undergoes anew a
      dialectical course of development.</P>
    
    <P>That is shown most tangibly in the question of the 'professional
      revolutionary'. The 'professional revolutionary' is a necessary product
      and tool of the leadership of the revolutionary organisation <I>that is
      illegal and is not yet a mass organisation. </I>In the <I>legal </I>Communist
      <I>mass </I>organisation there is no place for the 'professional
      revolutionary' <I>in this sense. </I>Here, as the movement grows, the
      'professional revolutionary' too easily changes into the characterless,
      politically and materially corrupt careerist bureaucrat, for whom the
      revolutionary movement is a source of a living, of a career, of
      parliamentary and other posts.</P>
    
    <P>Out of revolutionary centralism the danger of bureaucratic centralism
      develops anew, on a higher plane, and becomes a hindrance, a fetter on the
      movement, and against it one must appeal to the revolutionary
      self-activity of the party ranks. Is this danger present today in the
      Communist International and its sections? Undoubtedly! Consequently,
      however, in this question today, too, it is not a matter of Lenin or
      Luxemburg, but Lenin and Luxemburg. This means that upholding the Leninist
      principle of revolutionary centralisation today demands a struggle against
      the bureaucratic, opportunist or ultra-left degeneration of into
      bureaucratic centralism demands an appeal to the revolutionary
      self-activity of the membership of the Communist Party in the
      spirit of Rosa Luxemburg. In this struggle, however, we can also refer to
      Lenin, who began the struggle against party and state bureaucratism in the
      victorious Soviet state. These are only some examples for a general lesson
      that is still suitable for a variety of practical applications.</P>
    
    <P>The party bureaucracy perceives Lenin and Luxemburg as opposed to each
      other and thereby proves that it has not understood either. We
      counter-pose to the bureaucracy not only the formal but also the spiritual
      bond of these two great revolutionary champions of the working class and
      their closest comrades in arms, their mutual supplementary features as
      revolutionary leaders, as practicians and theoreticians. What unites them,
      is that they used the <I>very same principle </I>on different levels,
      situations and spheres of the great totality of the world revolution.</P>
    
    <P>This whole also transcends the greatest individuals. The individual
      greatness of revolutionary leaders is also subject to the law of the
      dialectic: it exists only as much as it is not just an individual, but a
      general thing, as it participates in the greatness of the cause of the
      proletarian revolution. Where an attempt is made to bring it into play
      counter to, or independent from it, then the greatest individual talents
      and gifts shrivel up to <I>a </I>veritable zero, as shown by manifest
      examples.</P>
