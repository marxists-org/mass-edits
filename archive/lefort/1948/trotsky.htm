<p class="quoteb">"Let us hold out our hands to each other and rally around our 
Party's committees. We must not forget even for a minute that only the Party 
committees can worthily lead us, only they will light our way to the Promised 
Land."</p>

<p class="fst">It was in these words, with the turn of phrase now familiar to us 
all, that as early as 1905 Stalin addressed the Russian workers on the occasion 
of their first revolution. It may well have been on that very same day, Trotsky 
notes, that Lenin dispatched from Geneva the following appeal to the masses: 
"Make way for the anger and hatred that have accumulated in your hearts 
throughout the centuries of exploitation, suffering and grief!"<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Nothing could be more typical of the two men, or better bring out 
the contrast between them, than these two statements, one made by a 
revolutionary for whom the oppressed masses are the essential force of history, 
the other made by a party militant, already a "bureaucrat", for whom the party 
apparatus alone knows what the future is to be and is capable of bringing it 
about. For us who are familiar with the course that events have taken since 
then, this psychological opposition assumes a more general significance, for it 
forms part of a broader opposition that is essentially historical in character.</p>

<p class="fst">In his long book on Stalin, Trotsky tried to expose the character 
of his protagonist and the nature of his behaviour before his accession to power 
and to show how both were in a sense legitimated by history during the decline 
of the revolution, with the formation of a new social stratum, the bureaucracy. 
In substantiating his thesis, Trotsky used the traditional methods of the 
historian: he examined the documents, explored the annals of Bolshevism, cited 
eye-witnesses, interpreted dates, placed side by side documents written prior to 
1923 and the commissioned panegyrics composed after the advent of the 
bureaucracy.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> In the first phase of his political activity, Stalin is shown to 
have been a "provincial" militant, intellectually mediocre and politically 
inept. In Georgia, he never managed to bring together a Bolshevik fraction to 
confront the Mensheviks within the social-democratic fold; he attended the first 
Bolshevik Party congresses only in the capacity of an observer, since he never 
managed to win a sufficient number of votes to get elected as a delegate. At the 
London Congress, the mandate that he claimed was shown to be fraudulent and he 
was deprived of voting rights. He was able to join the Bolshevik Central 
Committee only by co-option, that is, without ever having been elected by the 
party militants. The uprising of February 1917 suddenly gave him, in Lenin's 
absence, an exceptional degree of power which he used as badly as possible: he 
was in favour of supporting the provisional government, the revolutionary war 
and, in the final analysis, the revolution in two stages. He was one of those 
opportunistic conciliators whom the workers in the party wanted to expel,<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> and 
whom Lenin was later to return to their places, when he put forward his famous 
April theses and rearmed the party with a view to the seizure of power. These 
fragments of information enable Trotsky to sketch a portrait of a rather 
uninteresting character, a "functionary" as Trotsky says, by which he wished to 
stress Stalin's narrow preoccupation with his work, his limitations as a 
theoretician and his propensity for routine. Trotsky's intention is obvious: he 
wanted to show that the "qualities" which enabled Stalin to become the man of 
the bureaucracy are precisely those which prevented him from being a 
revolutionary figure.</p>

<p class="fst">The argument is clear enough and sufficiently supported with 
evidence. But, in that case, one cannot but be surprised that a political writer 
of Trotsky's abilities should have believed it his duty to devote such a large 
book to him, to undertake a task that consists very largely of anecdotal 
history, almost of detective work, to prove that, through-out the 
pre-revolutionary and revolutionary period, Stalin was an obscure figure, and 
that it was precisely this fact which enabled him to emerge, in 1924, as a 
"ready-male dictator". Stalin's life was not unknown to the public. In 1935 
Boris Souvarine had published a substantial work on Stalin,<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> to which Trotsky 
added little that was new and of which, curiously enough, he pretended to be 
unaware. If we assume that Trotsky felt that he had a duty to inform the 
revolutionary vanguard about the background and development of the current 
dictator of Russia, then this duty had already been carried out. But Souvarine 
was not content, as Trotsky had been in his three hundred pages, to describe 
Stalin's behaviour. He had skilfully integrated this study into a much broader 
and more interesting analysis &#8211; the Bolshevik Party. The single-minded 
determination with which Trotsky stresses the mediocrity of his "hero", and the 
subordinate nature of the posts that he occupied in the revolutionary apparatus 
has, of course, been taken as an indication of Trotsky's personal resentment and 
desire for self-justification. Trotsky, it is said, set out to compare his own 
situation and destiny with those of Stalin before the revolution; he wanted to 
bring out the enormous distance that separated himself from that obscure 
functionary of Bolshevism. However, if one knows anything about Trotsky's 
temperament one soon realizes that such concerns were quite alien to him and 
that such an interpretation is artificial. If one must speak of 
self-justification, it would be more appropriate to do so by giving this term a 
political sense. One might say, for instance, that Trotsky wished to show that 
he had been deprived of power not because of any lack of political intelligence, 
but by the overwhelming power of objective factors. And this power of objective 
factors could be proved by the very mediocrity of the new leader. The end of 
Trotsky's Introduction makes this interpretation a very tempting one, "He 
[Stalin] took possession of power", writes Trotsky,</p>

<p class="quoteb">"not with the aid of personal qualities, but with the aid of an 
impersonal machine. And it was not he who created the machine, but the machine 
that created him. That machine, with its force and its authority, was the 
product of the prolonged and heroic struggle of the Bolshevik Party, which 
itself grew out of ideas. The machine was the bearer of the idea before it 
became an end in itself ... Lenin created the machine through constant 
association with the masses, if not by oral word, then by printed word, if not 
directly, then through the medium of his disciples. Stalin did not create the 
machine but took possession of it."<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky was already expressing, in a different form, the same 
sentiments when, in <i>My Life</i>, he wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"And the fact that today he is playing first is not so much a 
summing-up of the man as it is of this transitional period of political 
backsliding in the country. Helvetius said it long ago: 'Every period has its 
great men, and if these are lacking, it invents them.' Stalinism is above all 
else the automatic work of the impersonal apparatus of the decline of the 
revolution."<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">However I do not believe that this interpretation is entirely 
satisfactory either. Trotsky's study of Stalin does not strike me so much as a 
conscious attempt at self-justification; it seems to me, above all, to play the 
role of a substitute. When we open his <i>Stalin</i>, we are in no doubt that 
Trotsky has written under this title a new study of the USSR, that he has taken 
up again the whole problem of Stalinism and tried to give it an economic and 
social characterization: this was certainly his concern, as we know from his 
last published articles. It is what we expected of him. But this Stalin, this 
imposingly long work which laboriously follows the steps of the then anonymous 
master of the Kremlin, showing us that he was unable to direct a particular 
strike, or that while in deportation he went around with common-law criminals 
and was despised by the political prisoners: this work that one would have liked 
to regard as important is restricted to demolishing a legend in which serious 
people do not believe. I regard this work, therefore, as a kind of <i>aborted 
attempt</i>. Trotsky gossips quite unnecessarily about Stalin, because he would 
like to, but cannot, define Stalinism. Nothing could better confirm us in this 
belief than the second part of the book, which is intentionally more limited and 
insubstantial and which deals by allusion with events of the first 
importance<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a>: this is because it concerns specifically the period of the 
crystallization and triumph of the bureaucracy, that is, not so much Stalin 
himself as Stalinism. But Trotsky could not claim that he had exhausted the 
subject in the two or three chapters that he devoted to it in <i>The Revolution 
Betrayed</i> and in <i>My Life</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">It is to this formative period of Stalinism that I should like to 
return, beginning with the scattered statements on the subject that are to be 
found in Trotsky's last work. By its inadequacies, its contradictions, by its 
silences as well, it calls for a critique that would put Trotsky back in his 
place as an actor in a situation which, when writing his book, he tries all too 
easily to master.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">Trotsky's Struggle against Stalin</a></h3>

<p class="fst">A reading of Stalin, or of the earlier <i>The Revolution Betrayed</i> 
or <i>My Life</i>, would lead one to believe that the attitude of Trotsky and of 
the Left Opposition, in the great period of 1923-7, was a perfectly rigorous 
one. It is as if Trotsky, "bearer" of revolutionary consciousness, had been 
swept aside by the inexorable course of things that were then developing in a 
reactionary direction. There were a great many who, taking sides against Trotsky 
and in a way for Stalin, reproached Trotsky only for not having been realistic 
enough, not having been able to "adapt" the politics of revolutionary Russia to 
the difficult circumstances of a capitalist world undergoing reconsolidation. 
They did not dispute that Trotsky had then adopted a clearly revolutionary 
attitude, but it was precisely this attitude that they denounced as abstract. In 
any case, it is not usually denied that the Left Opposition had a coherent 
strategy, whether it was justified at the level of revolutionary morality or 
whether it was regarded as inopportune. Trotsky himself largely lent support to 
this view. In his works, he speaks of this period with perfect serenity, 
repeating that he acted as he had to act in the given objective situation. 
History, he says in essence, was taking a new course. No one could block the 
ebbing tide of the revolution. Thus, recalling the events of the decisive year 
1927, he writes in <i>My Life</i>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"We went to meet the inevitable debacle, confident, however, that 
we were paving the way for the triumph of our ideas in a more distant future ... 
It is possible by force of arms to check the development of progressive 
historical tendencies; it is not possible to block the road of the advance of 
progressive ideas for ever. That is why, when the struggle is one for great 
principles, the revolutionary can only follow one rule: <i>Fais ce que tu dois</i>, <i>
advienne que pourra</i>."<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It would be quite admirable, when one is in the midst of 
historical action, to retain such lucidity and to be able to stand above 
day-to-day events, perceiving what is permanent in the heart of what is 
immediately present. But one must ask whether Trotsky was as lucid when he was 
acting as he was when he was writing. For it is one thing to judge one's own 
past actions, to look back on a relatively closed period in which the most 
diverse actions seem to take on a single, absolute meaning; it is a quite 
different thing to act in an equivocal situation with an indeterminate future. 
In his <i>Stalin</i> Trotsky defines once again the principles of the Left 
Opposition in its anti-Stalinist struggle:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Numerous critics, publicists, correspondents, historians, 
biographers, and sundry amateur sociologists, have lectured the Left Opposition 
from time to time on the error of its ways, saying that the strategy of the Left 
Opposition was not feasible from the point of view of the struggle for power. 
However, the very approach to the question was incorrect. The Left Opposition 
could not achieve power, and did not hope even to do so&#8212;certainly not its most 
thoughtful leaders. A struggle for power by the Left Opposition, by a 
revolutionary Marxist organization, was conceivable only under the conditions of 
a revolutionary upsurge. Under such conditions the strategy is based on 
aggression, on direct appeal to the masses, on frontal attack against the 
government, quite a few members of the Left Opposition had played no minor part 
in such a struggle and had first-hand knowledge of how to wage it. But during 
the early twenties and later, there was no revolutionary upsurge in Russia, 
quite the contrary. Under such circumstances it was out of the question to 
launch a struggle for power.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Bear in mind that in the years of reaction, in 1908-1911 and 
later, the Bolshevik Party refused to launch a direct attack upon the monarchy 
and limited itself to the task of preparing for the eventual offensive by 
fighting for the survival of the revolutionary traditions and for the 
preservation of certain cadres, subjecting the developing events to untiring 
analysis, and utilizing all legal and semi-legal possibilities for training the 
advance stratum of workers. The Left Opposition could not proceed otherwise 
under similar conditions. Indeed the conditions of Soviet reaction were 
immeasurably more difficult for the Opposition than the conditions of the 
Tsarist reaction had been for the Bolsheviks."<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The first observation to be made is that this interpretation of 
the years following 1927 is in contradiction with Trotsky's general theses on 
the nature of Stalinism. In all his works he has said that Stalinism is based on 
a proletarian infrastructure: it is reactionary, but it is a moment of the 
dictatorship of the proletariat. For example, in "The Workers' State, Thermidor 
and Bonapartism" Trotsky writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"This usurpation [of power by the bureaucracy] was made possible 
and can maintain itself only because the social content of the dictatorship of 
the bureaucracy is determined by those productive relations that were created by 
the proletarian revolution. In this sense we may say with complete justification 
that the dictatorship of the proletariat found its distorted but indubitable 
expression in the dictatorship of the bureaucracy."<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">How, then, if one maintains Trotsky's general theses on the 
nature of Stalinism, could the struggle against Stalin, still regarded by him as 
a political struggle, require, as he says in his last work, a revolutionary 
upheaval? When Trotsky compares the situation of the Left Opposition with that 
in which the Bolshevik Party found itself in its struggle against Tsarism, he 
implies&#8212;quite rightly, in my opinion, but in contradiction with all his 
theses&#8212;that the struggle against the bureaucracy could only be a class struggle. 
I can only agree with the conclusions that he draws from this: the maintenance 
of revolutionary traditions, the preservation of the cadres, the tireless 
analysis of events in order to instruct the most conscious workers. But it is no 
accident if these conclusions, whose true import he fails to grasp, correspond 
in no way to the real tactics which were his and those of the Left Opposition in 
practice.</p>

<p class="fst">Indeed it is striking to see, when one examines the events of 
this period closely, that the struggle of the Left Opposition against Stalin 
almost never assumed a revolutionary form and always developed around 
compromise. The problem is not the one that Trotsky poses, namely, whether it 
was possible or desirable to undertake a struggle for power. The question was to 
lead the struggle&#8212;or to lay the ground for the future&#8212;in a revolutionary spirit. 
The Bolsheviks were in retreat between 1908 and 1911 and postponed until later 
the struggle for the seizure of power; but, on the theoretical plane, they did 
not make the slightest concession to their adversaries. At no time did the 
Bolsheviks ever indulge in a policy of compromise or conciliation with Tsarism. 
By contrast, it is Trotsky himself who declared in November 1934, referring to 
his attitude to Eastman when the latter revealed on his own initiative the 
existence of Lenin's Testament: "My statement at that time on Eastman cannot be 
understood except as an integral part of our line, which, at that time, was 
orientated towards conciliation and appeasement."<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> In 1929 he was writing 
from the same point of view and in a much more brutal manner:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Right up to the last minute, I avoided the struggle, for, in the 
first stage, it had the character of an unprincipled conspiracy directed towards 
me, personally. It was clear to me that a struggle of this nature, once begun, 
would inevitably assume an exceptional vigour and, in the conditions of the 
revolutionary dictatorship, might lead to dangerous consequences. This is not 
the place to try to find out whether it was correct at the cost of the greatest 
personal concessions to tend to preserve the foundations of a common work, or 
whether it was necessary for me to throw myself into an offensive all along the 
line, despite the absence, for such an offensive, of adequate political bases 
The fact is that I chose the first solution and that in spite of everything I do 
not regret it."<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky speaks here in an intentionally vague way of "personal 
concessions". But it is clear that, given his situation, those conditions could 
only have a political character. Without going into detail as to what those 
concessions were, in other words, what the Left Opposition's policy of 
"conciliation and appeasement" actually was, something should be said about a 
period that Trotsky usually passes over fairly rapidly: the year 1923, when 
Lenin was still alive and preparing a "bomb against Stalin" for the Twelfth 
Congress, when Trotsky was still regarded as the second most important Bolshevik 
leader by the majority of the party, and when, above all, Stalin had not yet 
succeeded in achieving complete control of the party apparatus and the newfound 
power of the bureaucracy was still vulnerable. It is usually thought that the 
antagonism between Trotsky and Stalin was much more severe than that between 
Stalin and Lenin. Yet it appears, quite indisputably, according to Trotsky's own 
memoirs, that it was not he, at this time, who wanted to take up the struggle 
against Stalin, but Lenin. While fatally ill, Lenin had perceived, quite 
lucidly, the extreme danger that Stalin and his bureaucratic methods represented 
for the future of the party. The documents that he left and which are known as 
the Testament leave no doubt on this question. They show in the most striking 
way that Lenin had decided to launch a decisive struggle against the heads of 
the bureaucracy: Stalin, Ordzhonikidze and Dzerzhinsky. Trotsky's memoirs show 
just as clearly that, although he basically shared Lenin's point of view, he did 
not wish to trigger off decisive hostilities against the Stalinists. Relating a 
conversation that he had had at this time with Kamenev, who had already gone 
over to Stalin's side and was acting as his emissary, Trotsky writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">" 'Sometimes,' I said out of fear of an imaginary danger, people 
are capable of bringing real danger down upon themselves. Remember, and tell 
others, that the last thing I want is to start a fight at the congress for any 
changes in organization. I am for preserving the status quo. If Lenin gets on 
his feet before the congress, of which there is unfortunately little chance, he 
and I will discuss the matter together anew. I am against removing Stalin, and 
expelling Ordzhonikidze, and displacing Dzerzhinsky from the commissariat of 
transport. But I do agree with Lenin in substance.' "<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Apart from Trotsky's memoirs, the documents are there to show 
that, against Lenin's will, Trotsky turned the Twelfth Congress of the Bolshevik 
Party into a congress of unanimity; the "bomb" concerning the "national question 
that Lenin had advised Trotsky to explode at this congress was set aside. Again 
it is Trotsky who prides himself on having avoided any struggle with Stalin by 
contenting himself with amending his resolution instead of fighting it. 
Significant too was his refusal to present the political report to the congress 
in Lenin's absence. And the justifications that he gave are no less significant. 
His whole conduct seems to have been dictated by a concern not to present 
himself as a pretender to Lenin's succession. It is difficult to understand 
these preoccupations, these sentimental scruples on the part of a Bolshevik, 
when a vital political question was at stake.</p>

<p class="fst">In fact, Trotsky had refused from the beginning, even when in a 
superior position, to initiate a struggle to regenerate the party by attacking 
the bureaucracy. When he maintains that a struggle for power was impossible, it 
is difficult to believe him &#8211; at least in the case of the year 1923, when 
nothing had yet been decided. Indeed he himself was to write later:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Would Lenin have been able to carry out the regrouping in the 
party direction that he planned? At that moment, he undoubtedly would ... Our 
joint action against the Central Committee at the beginning of 1923 would 
without a shadow of a doubt have brought us victory. And what is more, I have no 
doubt that if I had come forward on the eve of the twelfth congress in the 
spirit of a 'bloc of Lenin and Trotsky' against the Stalin bureaucracy, I should 
have been victorious even if Lenin had taken no direct part in the 
struggle."<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is true that Trotsky adds: "How solid the victory would have 
been is, of course, another question." But even if one answers this question 
negatively, as he does by showing that the flow of history was then turning into 
the ebb of the revolution, the task of the politician could never be to 
compromise with the ebb.</p>

<p class="fst">Now, from that point on and "to the very last minute", the Left 
Opposition practised a policy of "conciliation" and "appeasement". Even this 
policy could not remain coherent, for even if the Left Opposition did not want a 
fight, the bureaucracy did. Its triumph involved the annihilation of the former 
revolutionary leader, at the very time that this leader was seeking an 
understanding. So Trotsky was led to attack on several occasions; but his 
attacks bore the sign of his weakness. As Souvarine rightly remarks, Trotsky 
wore himself out in a vain polemic within the politbureau. In his articles 
(those that he published on the <i>New Course</i> in 1923, and the <i>Lessons of 
October</i> in 1924) he piled allusion on allusion and wrote in such a way that 
he could be understood only by the leadership of the party. None of his writing 
was intended to instruct the ordinary militants. Far more seriously, while the 
bureaucratic repression pitilessly tracked down the members or sympathizers of 
the Left Opposition, Trotsky did nothing to defend them; by his constantly 
shifting line he disarmed them politically; he gave them no platform for 
struggle, no theoretical element that might enable them to recognize themselves 
and to regroup.</p>

<p class="fst">This is not the place to follow in detail Trotsky's political 
development throughout this period, but we should highlight a few particularly 
important episodes. At the time of the Thirteenth Congress, the first to be 
completely "fabricated" by the bureaucrats, Trotsky, after having defended his 
views of the State Plan, felt obliged to stress the unity of the party in terms 
that could not fail to throw all his supporters into confusion.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"None of us desires or is able to dispute the will of the Party. 
Clearly, the Party is always right ... We can only be right with and by the 
Party, for history has provided no other way of being in the right. The English 
have a saying 'My country, right or wrong,' whether it is in the right or in the 
wrong, it is my country. We have much better historical justification in saying 
whether it is right or wrong in certain individual concrete cases, it is my 
party ... And if the Party adopts a decision which one or other of us thinks 
unjust, he will say, just or unjust, it is my Party, and I shall support the 
consequences of the decision to the end."<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was Trotsky who, in his <i>Stalin</i> of 1940, imposes upon himself 
the most categorical refutation of this view when he declares that a political 
party is neither "a homogeneous entity", nor "an omnipotent historical factor", 
but "only a temporary historical instrument, one of very many instruments and 
schools of history".<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> The true meaning of Trotsky's statement at the 
Thirteenth Congress emerges when one realizes that at that time he was aware of 
the complete bureaucratization of the organization and the mystification which 
prevailed at the congress. Indeed, shortly before, there had taken place a 
massive intake of new members to the party which came to be known as "Lenin's 
levy" and which, Trotsky was to write later, was a "manoeuvre ... to dissolve 
the revolutionary vanguard in raw human material, without experience, without 
independence, and yet with the old habit of submitting to the authorities".<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> 
This levy had been made in order to turn the party into a docile instrument in 
the hands of its general secretary. However "Lenin's promotion", which, Trotsky 
was to say on another occasion, "delivered a mortal blow to Lenin's party", was 
also approved by him during the Thirteenth Congress. Trotsky even pushed 
concession to the point of declaring that it "brought the party nearer to being 
an elected party"<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is true that the struggle against Trotskyism had not yet come 
out into the open and, more importantly, that Stalinism was only just emerging 
as a political entity. Trotsky's concessions seemed all the more tragic when 
battle commenced. After the first phase of this battle, after Trotsky had 
triggered off a struggle in favour of the New Course, after he had been the 
object of a campaign of systematic attacks from the politbureau, after Stalin 
had put forward his view of socialism in one country,<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> Trotsky published an 
article in Pravda (January 1925) in which he denies ever having thought of 
opposing a platform to the Stalinist majority.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> This was to state clearly 
that there was no fundamental divergence between him and this majority. 
Capitulation appears again in that year 1925, on the occasion of the Eastman 
affair. In a work entitled <i>Since Lenin Died</i>, the American journalist, a 
Bolshevik sympathizer, had taken it upon himself, as I have already indicated, 
to reveal the existence and the content of Lenin's Testament, which Trotsky, in 
agreement with the Central Committee, had thought good to conceal not only from 
the Russian masses, but also from the party militants and from communists 
throughout the world. Trotsky's declaration, at this time, would deserve to be 
quoted in full, so striking is the degree to which it reveals Trotsky's bad 
faith and the practice of the "supreme sacrifice" Trotsky accuses Eastman of 
"despicable lying" and implies that he is an agent of international reaction. 
"Comrade Lenin", he writes, "did not leave a testament: the nature of his 
relations with the Party and the nature of the Party itself excludes the 
possibility of such a testament." Referring to Lenin's letter on the 
reorganization of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection (in which Stalin had the 
upper hand), Trotsky does not hesitate to declare: "Eastman's affirmation 
according to which the C.C. was anxious to conceal, that is to say, not publish, 
Comrade Lenin's article on the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection is equally 
erroneous. The different points of view expressed in the C.C., <i>if it 
is actually possible to speak of a difference of points of view</i> in this 
case, was of absolutely secondary importance."<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> How could Trotsky speak in 
this way, when Lenin, on this very point, was making a fundamental attack, and 
when Trotsky was fully in agreement with him, as he has repeated a hundred 
times?</p>

<p class="fst">We cannot complete the balance sheet of this politics of 
conciliation without showing that, even on the theoretical level, Trotsky was 
confused. I have already shown that he did not regard the struggle against the 
theory of socialism in one country, when it was "discovered" by Stalin, as a 
matter of fundamental principle. One must also recognize that Trotsky did not 
oppose the entry of the Chinese communists into the Kuomintang nor the tactics 
used by the British communists within the trade-union Anglo-Russian Committee. 
In each case, he took up the struggle against the Stalinist policy only when it 
was obviously turning into a disaster.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> I said above that the tactics of the 
Left Opposition had helped to disarm the revolutionary vanguard in Russia; I 
should add, in the light of these examples, that it also had a negative effect 
on the revolutionary vanguard throughout the world. Trotsky said that Stalin 
appeared to the world one day as a "ready-made dictator"&#8212;he forgot to mention 
his own responsibility in this regard.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, it was in the last stage of the struggle between the 
Opposition and the Stalinist leadership, as this struggle became more violent, 
that the capitulations became more radical and more tragic. On two occasions, in 
October 1926 and in November 1927, the Left Opposition, which then had the 
support not only of Trotsky but also of Kamenev and Zinoviev, solemnly condemned 
itself, repudiated its supporters abroad and undertook its own dissolution. 
Finally, when there was no hope left for it, when Stalin had at his disposal a 
Congress (the Fifteenth) that obeyed him blindly, the Opposition made a final 
attempt to return to favour, and drew up a new condemnation of its own activity, 
namely, the Declaration of the 121. This is a document of the greatest 
historical importance, because it represents the last public action of the Left 
Opposition in Russia. The declaration begins by proclaiming that the unity of 
the Communist Party is the highest principle during the period of the 
dictatorship of the proletariat. We find the same terms that Trotsky had used in 
his speech to the Thirteenth Congress quoted above. The party is regarded as a 
divine factor in historical development, independently of its content and its 
line. The declaration thus underlines the danger of a war against the USSR and 
declares that there is nothing more urgent than to re-establish "the combatant 
unity of the party" One may find it extraordinary that the Opposition was 
seeking <i>above all</i> to preserve the facade of party unity, whereas the 
gravest dissensions were setting it against the leadership of this party. But 
the 121 had decided to regard their dissensions with the party as insignificant. 
Of course, on several occasions, they repeated that they were convinced of the 
correctness of their views and that they would continue to defend them, as the 
organizational statutes allowed them to do, after they had dissolved their 
fraction; but at the same time they proclaimed: "<i>There is no programmatic 
difference between us and the Party</i>."<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> And they bitterly denied that they 
had ever believed that the party or its Central Committee had followed a 
Thermidorian course. Now, not only had the party completely lost its 
revolutionary and democratic character in 1927, but it had adopted the 
perspective of socialism in one country, that is, it had in fact renounced the 
perspective of world revolution.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">Bolshevism and the Rise of Bureaucracy</a></h3>

<p class="fst">So that royal road, along which Trotsky, if his Stalin is to be 
believed, would have led the Left Opposition, never in fact existed. For five 
years Trotsky improvised a policy from day to day, a policy of harsh 
concessions, of revolt&#8212;when the domination of the bureaucracy became too 
unbearable&#8212;then of capitulations which led to new explosions. It is not possible 
here to follow the behaviour of the various representatives of the Opposition. 
But there were many defectors among them, not to mention Zinoviev and Kamenev, 
who had become professionals of capitulation. Of course, the face of Trotsky 
stands out from the group, for he was not a man to give in completely. But his 
responsibility can only be more striking. How could he blame the defectors when 
his entire policy tended to deny any "programmatic difference" with the 
Stalinists? This policy can be summed up in the formula that he used in 1927: 
"What separates us [from the bureaucracy] is incomparably less than what unites 
us."<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> It was a policy of suicide, since, despite all his practical 
declarations, Trotsky was not taken in by the bureaucratic degeneration, as a 
thousand details prove. His interventions in the higher bodies of the party and 
the notes that he himself mentions in his memoirs leave no doubt on the matter. 
He deliberately misled public opinion in the name of higher ends, that is, in 
order to defend the Soviet state in the world .</p>

<p class="fst">How can we understand that Trotsky, while perceiving the complete 
bureaucratization of the party and the reactionary character of the policies of 
its leaders, continued to feel at one with this party and its leaders? One can 
only answer this question by standing back and placing Trotsky and Trotskyism in 
their objective development. What is interesting, for me, is not to see whether 
Trotsky acted well or badly in a given situation, but to explain his attitude. 
In this sense, much of Souvarine's critique seems to me to be artificial. In 
many passages, he criticizes Trotsky for leading the struggle badly, for 
provoking the hatred of the leaders by inopportune polemics, for pushing 
Zinoviev and Kamenev in Stalin's direction instead of driving them apart, in 
general for being unable to wait for the bloc of his enemies to crumble, for 
being unable to play for time and manoeuvre as his adversaries were doing. I do 
not share Souvarine's point of view. Even if Trotsky had often been intransigent 
and clumsy, despite his general line of conciliation, this is merely a minor 
aspect of the question; and, in any case, he should not be criticized for being 
incapable of manoeuvring within the circles of leadership, but, on the contrary, 
for having all too often confined his actions to these circles. Indeed, 
Souvarine seems to appreciate this all too well when he levels his criticism, 
not at Trotsky's personality, but at the development of his positions.</p>

<p class="fst">If we are to offer an objective critique of Trotsky and of the 
Left Opposition, we must put aside evaluative criteria in favour of a concrete, 
historical point of view. Trotsky seems to adopt this point of view when he 
tries to reduce everything to some such explanation as "the revolution was at an 
ebb". In fact this explanation, though not incorrect, is unsatisfactory, for it 
is much too broad. The conception of the revolutionary ebb may enable us to 
understand the failure of the Opposition, but not its ideological disarray. It 
is because the explanation is too broad that Trotsky often invokes another one, 
this time too narrow: the machinations of Stalin and his supporters. In fact we 
can understand the policies of Trotsky and of the revolutionary leaders who 
surrounded him, after 1923, only by integrating them into the previous 
development of the Bolshevik Party.</p>

<p class="fst">For it is certainly Bolshevism that continued to be expressed in 
the Left Opposition, and what we have to try to explain is its inability to 
survive as a revolutionary ideology and strategy. In a passage in his <i>Stalin</i>, 
Trotsky attempts to elude the problem:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Sterile and absurd are the Sisyphean labours of those who try to 
reduce all subsequent developments to a few allegedly basic original attributes 
of the Bolshevik Parry ... The Bolshevik Party set for itself the goal of the 
conquest of power by the working class. In so far as that party accomplished 
this task for the first time in history and enriched human experience with this 
conquest, it fulfilled a tremendous historical role. Only the bewildered with a 
liking for abstruse discussion can demand of a political party that it should 
subjugate and eliminate far weightier factors of mass and class hostile to 
it."<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One cannot but agree as to the prodigious historical role of the 
Bolsheviks. But the question is badly put. It is obviously not a matter of 
requiring the party to win some sort of triumph over the course of history, but 
to understand how the course of history is expressed through the structure and 
life of the party itself. The fact that the Bolshevik Party carried out the 
October Revolution must not lead one to deify it and to see its subsequent 
failure as a mere accident. The failure of the Bolshevik Party in 1923 must be 
understood in terms of the internal dynamics of that party. In no sense am I 
trying to minimize the role of objective factors, but rather to discern, on the 
basis of the Bolshevik experience, the enduring power which they may have.</p>

<p class="fst">I have no wish to go over again&#8212;enough books and studies of every 
kind have brought this out&#8212;the very particular character of Russia within the 
capitalist world prior to 1917, the backward nature of its economy and the lack 
of education among the masses. If this very situation, as has also been 
stressed, was favourable to the formation of a vigorous revolutionary party, the 
social contradictions having been carried to their breaking point, then it is no 
less true&#8212;and commentators have usually had little to say about this aspect of 
things&#8212;that it had fundamental consequences as regards the structure and 
functioning of the party. The development of the professional revolutionary in 
Russia was probably unique and unparalleled in other countries: the necessities 
of illegality in the face of the Tsarist autocracy, the habit of living under 
oppression and in great poverty, helped to create the type of revolutionary 
practitioner represented <i>par excellence</i> by the Bolshevik. But one must 
also see that, by the very logic of his situation, the professional 
revolutionary was led to detach himself from the masses, to maintain only 
superficial relations with the real vanguard in the factories. Secrecy obliged 
the revolutionary to live in small, relatively closed circles. This climate was 
favourable to centralization, not to democracy. In his Stalin, Trotsky supports 
this view:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The negative aspect of Bolshevism's centripetal tendencies first 
became apparent at the Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democracy. The 
habits peculiar to a political machine were already forming in the underground. 
The young revolutionary bureaucrat was already emerging as a type. The 
conditions of conspiracy, true enough, offered rather meagre scope for such of 
the formalities of democracy as electiveness, accountability and control. Yet, 
undoubtedly the committeemen narrowed these limitations considerably more than 
necessity demanded and were far more intransigent and severe with the 
revolutionary workingmen than with themselves, preferring to domineer even on 
occasions that called imperatively for lending an attentive ear to the voices of 
the masses. Krupskaya notes that, just as in the Bolshevik committees, so at the 
Congress itself, there were almost no workingmen. The intellectuals 
predominated. "The 'committeeman'," writes Krupskaya, "was usually quite a 
self-confident person; he was fully aware of the tremendous influence wielded by 
the Committee's activities on the masses; the 'committee-man', as a rule, did 
not recognize any internal party democracy."<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Of course, this divorce between certain professional 
revolutionaries and the masses was less marked in the great revolutionary 
moments, but the effects were nonetheless very serious. They could be observed 
on the occasion of the 1905 revolution, when the Bolsheviks refused to recognize 
the Soviets that had been spontaneously created by the workers. "The Petersburg 
Committee of the Bolsheviks", notes Trotsky, "was frightened at first by such an 
innovation as a non-partisan representation of the embattled masses, and could 
find nothing better to do than to present the Soviet with an ultimatum: 
immediately adopt a Social-Democratic programme or disband."<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It may be said that, if the Bolsheviks did not bring about a 
series of catastrophes, it was thanks to Lenin and to his exceptional ability to 
discern the revolutionary significance of every situation. But even Lenin's 
pre-eminence deserves reflection; one is struck by how insubstantial the best 
Bolshevik leaders appeared to be without him. There is a veritable gulf between 
Lenin and the other Bolshevik .leaders, as well as a gulf between those leaders 
and the average militants of the party organization. Innumerable cases might be 
cited as evidence, but no doubt the best known is provided by the events of 
February 1917 when, with Lenin in exile, Kamenev and Stalin took over the 
leadership of the party in his absence. When Lenin returned and presented his 
April theses, he was almost alone against the entire party, finding support only 
among the Bolshevik workers of Viborg. It would not be an exaggeration to say 
that the strength of the party was hanging on a thread. Of course, the Bolshevik 
workers were the best guarantee of its power, but they could not by themselves 
run the party organization and, among the cadres, no one other than Lenin could. 
This very special physiognomy of the Bolshevik Party became all the more 
apparent in the aftermath of the revolution and throughout the period of the 
civil war. Indeed the civil war, combined with economic chaos and the low level 
of education of the Russian masses, necessitated an increased concentration of 
power and an increasingly voluntarist political strategy in the face of an 
increasingly difficult situation. Souvarine describes perfectly the evolution, 
in these conditions, of the Council of People's Commissars, which soon became 
the blue-print of the Bolshevik Central Committee and did nothing more than give 
a constitutional form to its decisions. He also shows that the Central Committee 
in turn existed less and less as a "college" and that real power was 
concentrated in the hands of an oligarchy within the politbureau. In all 
institutions, in the trade unions and in the Soviets, there was only one power 
and one policy, that of the Bolsheviks, who more and more became mere 
functionaries, alienated from the masses and from the workers in particular. The 
same logic led the Bolsheviks to eliminate all opposition. We know only too well 
the exceptional violence with which Lenin set about exterminating his 
adversaries, whether they were left-wing socialist revolutionaries or 
anarchists. Volin provides some striking information on this point. One sees the 
Bolsheviks fabricating compromising documents against the anarchists in order to 
inculpate them for criminal activities of which they were absolutely innocent. 
The terror that began by exterminating all the opposition parties and competing 
groups, and which culminated, within the Bolshevik Party itself, by forbidding 
the existence of factions, reached its paroxysm with the repression of the 
workers of Kronstadt who, once regarded as the revolutionary elite and fighting 
for demands some of which were confused but most of which were democratic, were 
treated as agents of counter-revolution and ruthlessly crushed.<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">All the facts concur: the party which, from its origin and by 
reason of the objective situation, tended to develop towards a military 
structure and functioned as a body loosely linked to the masses began to 
accentuate these traits considerably during the post-revolutionary period. One 
cannot but follow Souvarine when he takes up Bukharin's definition of the party 
as "entirely apart from and above everything".<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> On the other hand, it seems 
to me that Souvarine oscillates between a (subjective) criticism of the leaders' 
attitude and an objective interpretation that links this development of 
Bolshevism to the given economic, social, national and world situation. I 
repeat, the first criticism has no significance for me; let us put aside that 
kind of value judgement. The political strategy of the Bolshevik Party between 
1917 and 1923 was that of a revolutionary organization struggling desperately to 
preserve, until the outbreak of world revolution, a proletarian victory 
unprecedented in history. This strategy was essentially contradictory, since it 
led to the adoption of an anti-proletarian content in the name of the higher 
interests of the proletariat. But its contradictions were themselves objective, 
for they expressed the contradictions of the victorious Russian proletariat, 
stifled in its victory by negative factors on a national and international 
scale. The post-revolutionary period in Russia is the tragic moment of 
Bolshevism, torn apart between its ends and the nature of the forces that it 
tried to animate. This tragedy culminated in the repression of the workers of 
Kronstadt by Trotsky, who was led to crush them and to forge false evidence in 
order to persuade the whole world of their guilt. But this <i>moment of 
contradiction</i> was essentially transitory. Bolshevism could not remain split 
between its real behaviour and its principles; whatever the supreme ends at 
which it aimed, it could not survive if it were cut off from its real content &#8211; 
the proletarian masses that it represented. It could not remain without a social 
basis, as a pure will determined to force the course of history.</p>

<p class="fst">At the very heart of the party, the contradiction was expressed 
as the difference between the strategy of Lenin and Trotsky, who side by side 
were "steering towards world revolution", and the very body of the party, which 
was beginning to crystallize socially and was already taking on the form of a 
privileged caste. It is only from this point of view that one can understand the 
defeat of Trotsky, his liquidation in 1927 and, above all, his ideological 
collapse from 1923 on. Trotsky's struggle against the bureaucracy lacked any 
basis because Trotsky himself was objectively an artisan of that bureaucracy. 
Trotsky could not reproach Stalin for carrying out an anti-proletarian and 
anti-democratic policy when he had himself inaugurated that policy. He could not 
criticize the repression practised on the Opposition when he himself had taken 
part in the repression of the "Workers' Group" and "Workers' Truth". He was no 
longer free to find support among the vanguard of the factories because he had 
cut himself off from it. He had no overall platform against Stalin because he 
had allowed himself to be caught up in the contradiction that consists in 
directing the proletariat, according to its higher interests and against its 
immediate interests.</p>

<p class="fst">The turning-point of 1923 often seems difficult to understand. In 
fact, at this period the revolutionary character of Bolshevism was already 
hanging by a thread, in so far as the policies of Lenin and Trotsky were 
orientated towards world revolution. In the absence of this revolution, the 
thread could only snap. The contradiction was too intense and could not persist. 
Thus the rise of Stalin represents the eclipse of the contradiction and the 
emergence of a new term. In order to strengthen its hold, the new regime did not 
need to wage war against all the preceding values. They had destroyed themselves 
and, losing their true content, had already become, in a sense, the means of 
mystification. Thus Stalin could emerge without his policy seeming at first to 
be in opposition to Bolshevik policy. Thus the struggle he conducted against 
Trotsky could appear as a struggle between individuals. And Trotsky himself 
could declare that it was an "unprincipled conspiracy, directed against him 
personally". In fact it was an absolute break with the past, as the future was 
to show, but it appeared to be no more than an imperceptible transition, a 
question of individuals. Trotsky wanted to see the very existence of the party 
and the formal survival of the dictatorship of the proletariat as an historical 
guarantee of world revolution; he <i>wanted to believe</i> that this 
bureaucratized party, which was pursuing a counter-revolutionary strategy, was 
an essential element for the international proletariat. This is the significance 
of the strange declarations referred to above on the unity of the party and the 
significance, in general, of his conciliatory line. Such, too, was the 
significance of his intermittent shifts and changes. At one and the same time, 
he concealed the <i>Testament</i> and accused Stalin of abandoning Leninist 
policy; at one and the same time, he called for a "new course", a true 
democratization of the party, and declared, despite its bureaucratization, that 
"the Party is always right". He was no longer free to act as a revolutionary 
because he participated in a process which led him to turn his back on the 
masses. He was no longer free to act as a bureaucrat because he always sought to 
act, whatever his tactics might have been, in accordance with the revolutionary 
ideal.</p>

<p class="fst">Perhaps these contradictions are most strikingly expressed in his 
hesitation over the dating of "Thermidor". In 1923, he rejected any analogy with 
the Thermidorian reaction. In 1926, he was predicting the possibility of a 
Thermidorian course; at the same time he violently attacked the Leftists of 
Democratic Centralism, who were declaring that Thermidor was already a fact. In 
November 1927, following a demonstration in the streets in which supporters of 
the Opposition were molested by Stalinist gangs, he declared that they had just 
witnessed a general repetition of Thermidor. In 1927, with the 121, he declared 
that he had never thought that the party or its Central Committee were 
Thermidorian. In 1928-9, he announced yet again that there was a Thermidorian 
threat; then, in 1930, he brusquely declared: "With us, Thermidor has dragged 
on." Finally, in 1935, in his pamphlet, "The Workers' State, Thermidor and 
Bonapartism", he writes: "The Thermidor of the Great Russian Revolution is not 
before us but already far behind. The Thermidoreans can celebrate, 
approximately, the tenth anniversary of their victory."<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was worth examining carefully Trotsky's attitude at the dawn 
of Stalinism, for it enables us to elucidate the (theoretical) policy to which 
he adhered until his death. I have said that Trotsky represented, between 1923 
and 1927, the contradictions of Bolshevism. I should now add that he never 
emerged from this divided situation. Subsequently he transported into the domain 
of revolutionary theory the contradiction in which he had become objectively 
enclosed. Of course, he was forced by events to perceive the 
counter-revolutionary character of Stalinism, but he was not capable of taking 
an overall view of the new Stalinist society and of defining it. He transferred 
on to economic categories (collectivization, state planning) the fetishism that 
he had first professed with regard to political forms (party, Soviets). He 
declared both that "in contradistinction to capitalism, socialism is built not 
automatically but consciously. Progress towards socialism is inseparable from 
state power",<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a> and that "the dictatorship of the proletariat found its 
distorted, but unquestionable expression in the dictatorship of the 
bureaucracy".<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a> He shows how bureaucracy found an autonomous economic and 
social base,<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a> but he continues in all his works to maintain that bureaucracy 
is not a system of exploitation, that it is simply a parasitical caste. He 
writes, quite brilliantly, that "the Russian Thermidor would have undoubtedly 
opened a new era of bourgeois rule, if that rule had not proved obsolete 
throughout the world",<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a> thus indicating that the mode of exploitation based 
on private property had been superseded in the course of history without, for 
all that, resulting in the realization of socialism; and yet elsewhere he 
reiterates his view that the reign of bureaucracy was purely transitory and 
would inevitably collapse before the only two historical possibilities: 
capitalism or socialism.</p>

<p class="fst">I believe I have placed enough emphasis on the meaning of our 
critique in order to avoid misunderstandings. In my opinion, Stalinism is a 
system of exploitation, a system that is important to understand if one hopes to 
contribute in any way to the workers' movements; in the same way, it is crucial 
to understand modern capitalism as the system most likely to thwart them. When I 
evaluate Bolshevism&#8212;specifically in its period of decline&#8212;I do so while 
maintaining a relation of participation with it, for its strength and its crisis 
both flow from revolutionary ideology. Moreover, the romatico-fatalist 
assessments (that go something like "the failure of Bolshevism, the inspired 
party of overmen, show too well that revolution is impossible") seem alien and 
irrelevant to me. Bolshevism was the expression of an era. It did not fail 
because the proletariat was incompetent, but because Bolshevism was 
unprecedented in history. It failed because the socialist revolution was, in 
essence, a worldwide movement and because its foundations&#8212;the concentration of 
productive forces, the interpenetration of economies&#8212;were too inadequate at the 
time of the first World War; it failed because the socialist revolution was 
essentially proletarian and its conditions&#8212;the administration capacities of the 
proletariat&#8212;were not fully developed. It would be another task entirely&#8212;a task 
that exceeds the scope of this study&#8212;to show, on the one hand, that the bases of 
such a revolution were broadened while its barbarism was expanded, and, on the 
other, that this revolution exhibited traits&#8212;the effective participation of the 
proletarian vanguard in government, the significance of the autonomous organs of 
class, the reduced role of the party or parties in general&#8212;markedly different 
from those that characterized the Russian Revolution.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n28" href="#fn28">[28]</a> In this study, written in 1948, I merely allude to the 
crushing of the Kronstadt Commune and the repression practised by Bolshevik 
power against the workers' opposition movements. As far as Kronstadt is 
concerned, my sources were Voline's <i>La r&#233;volution inconnue</i> (republished 
in 1969 by Pierre Belfond) and an article by Victor Serge, "Kronstadt", in <i>
Politics</i> (April 1945). Since then, a great deal more information has been 
published. The following should be mentioned: Ida Mett, <i>La Commune de 
Cronstadt</i> (Paris: Spartacus, 1949); R. V. Daniels, "The Kronstadt Revolt of 
1921", <i>American Slavic and East European Review</i> (Dec. 1951) L. Schapiro, <i>
The Origin of the Communist Autocracy</i> (London: London School of Economics, 
1955), ch. XVI; George Katkov, "The Kronstadt Rising", <i>S:t Anthony's Papers</i>, 
no. 6 (1959); <i>La Commune de Cronstadt. Recueil de documents</i> (Paris: 
B&#233;libaste, 1969), which includes a translation of Kronstadt's Itvestia and 
extracts from the diary of an eye-witness, the anarchist Berkman; and P. Avrich, <i>
Kronstadt 1921</i> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1970).</p>

<p class="endnote">As far as the repression of the opposition movements is 
concerned, see especially the testimony of Ciliga, analysed in my <i>&#233;l&#233;ments 
d'unecritique de la bureaucratie</i> (Paris: Gallimard, 1979), pp. 145 ff., and 
E. H. Carr, <i>The Interregnum</i>, 1923-24 (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1954), 
pp.88-93, 276-8, 300-2. On the "Workers' Group" see L. Schapiro, <i>The 
Communist Party of the Soviet Union</i> (London: Constable, 1960), pp. 276-7; R. 
V. Daniels, <i>The Conscience of the Revolution</i> (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard 
University Press, 1960), pp. 158-9. On "Workers' Truth" see Daniels, <i>
Conscience of the Revolution</i>, pp. 204 and 210, <i>and A Documentary History 
of Communism</i>, (New York: Vintage, 1960), vol. I, pp. 2i0-23; Schapiro, <i>
Communist Party of the Soviet Union</i>, pp. 198-204.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n32" href="#fn32">[32]</a> One may also compare this statement with the final lines of 
Trotsky's Stalin which completely contradict it:</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%">" 'L'&#233;tat, c'est moi' [I am the State] is almost a liberal 
formula by comparison with the actualities of Stalin's totalitarian regime. 
Louis XIV identified himself only with the State. The Popes of Rome identified 
themselves with both the State and the Church &#8211; but only during the epoch of 
temporal power. The totalitarian state goes far beyond Caesaro-Papism, <i>for it 
has encompassed the entire economy of the country as well</i>. <i>Stalin can 
justly say</i>, <i>unlike the Sun King 'La Soci&#233;t&#233;</i>, <i>c'est moi'</i> [I am 
Society]." (<i>Stalin</i>, p. 421: Lefort's emphasis)</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n33" href="#fn33">[33]</a> For example in the passage of his <i>Stalin</i> where, 
referring to the period that saw the liquidation of the kulaks, Trotsky writes: 
"Thus opened the irreconcilable struggle over the surplus product of national 
labour. Who will dispose of it in the nearest future&#8212;the new bourgeoisie or the 
Soviet bureaucracy?&#8212;that became the next issue. He who disposes of the surplus 
product has the power of the State at his disposal." (<i>Stalin</i>, p. 397)</p>
