<h3>Britain in the World Front</h3>

<hr class="base" size="1">
<h4>Chapter II</h4>
<h3>What Stands in the Way?</h3>
<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<p class="fst">
THE greater part of a year has passed since the summer of 1941 brought the British-Soviet Pact and the world coalition against Fascism.
</p>
<p>
Where do we stand? Have the essential conditions for victory been carried out? Are we playing our full part in the Alliance? 
</p>
<p>
It is evident that the war is advancing to its highest intensity in these critical months of 1942. Are we prepared to play our part in these coming decisive conflicts?
</p>
<p>
In broad outline, on a large canvas, on a long term view, it might seem that all the conditions were present for victory, and that the road lies straight before us. The world coalition of the democratic Powers and of all the democratic anti-fascist forces exists, with overwhelmingly superior potential strength in resources and population to the fascist enemy. The headlong Nazi advance into the heart of the Soviet Union during the last six months of 1941 has been held and turned by the magnificent Soviet resistance. The Soviet counter-offensive has opened the possibility, given combined action, of the decisive defeat of Hitler this year, and the Soviet aim has been repeatedly and with increasing emphasis proclaimed for victory in 1942. United States production is being mobilised for war. In Britain there is more complete national unity than ever before in the history of this country for the common cause of victory over Fascism. There is the fullest support behind the Government for all the measures that are necessary for the achievement of this victory.
</p>
<p>
And yet&#8212;this is not the whole picture. Every one knows that we are still faced with a serious and critical situation, that the long chapter of grave reverses in a whole series of spheres of the war has up to the present continuously extended, and that we are still far from having reached that maximum effort and achievement which is indispensable for victory.
</p>
<p>
The potential superiority of the world coalition has not yet been translated into practical superiority in action. The unity of the alliance established in 1941 has not yet been accompanied by corresponding unity and co-ordination of strategy. During all these months the united strategy of the two-front war against Hitler has not yet been achieved; the Second Front in Europe does not yet exist; and the Nazi regime has been using these months to work all the arsenals of Europe overtime in preparation for the gigantic conflicts now opening. The only positive military action on our part during the first half-year since the Pact, alongside the terrific battles in Eastern Europe, the Libyan offensive, which opened in November, met with the set-back of Rommel&#8217;s counter-thrust. Japan with lightning speed has swept over Eastern Asia, directly menacing India and Australia. The divergence between the strategic conception of victory in 1942, proclaimed as the aim by Soviet spokesmen, and the conception of a waiting policy till 1943 or later, proclaimed by Anglo-American spokesmen, has so far remained unresolved.
</p>
<p>
On the home front the problems of production still clamour for effective solution. There is still confusion and wasted effort. While every theatre of war has revealed the same record of desperate shortage of material, there are still by common admission un-utilised reserves of productive power, and even restrictive influences hamper full production. There is not yet full mobilisation of the man-power and woman-power of the country. Passivity, half-heartedness and limited effort among wide sections have not yet been overcome. We have not yet achieved the self-sacrificing drive by every man and woman that is necessary to defeat Fascism.
</p>
<p>
It is only necessary to sense the opinion of every section of the nation to be conscious of the most widespread disquiet, anxiety, questioning; doubts of existing policies and strategy; doubts of the competence of ruling authorities or methods of organisation.
</p>
<p>
What is wrong? The answer is often given that &#8220;democracy works slowly,&#8221; that we cannot expect the same efficiency and speed of mobilisation as in the fascist regimes, that we will &#8220;muddle through,&#8221; that &#8220;time is on our side,&#8221; that the superiority of forces on our side will tell in the long run, that we must trust to a waiting policy, etc. The inadequacy of these answers is manifest, and has by now been abundantly proved by experience. It is not true that Fascism is efficient and that democracy is necessarily inefficient. On the contrary, one of the most significant facts of the recent period has been that in contrast to the collapse of France in a few weeks and the Anglo-American reverses, it has been precisely the most advanced democratic forms of organisation, the People&#8217;s Armies of the Soviet Union and China, which have won successes against Nazi Germany and against Japan. We need more democracy, not less. We need the fullest scope for the initiative and creative energy of the people overcoming all barriers. The ruthless &#8220;total war&#8221; of Fascism cannot be met by bureaucratic methods or by waiting defensive policies which expect automatic victories or mistake potential resources for actual resources. The defeat of the fascist onslaught requires full and conscious participation of the mass of the people, ready for the maximum effort and sacrifice, just as it requires the full mobilisation, organisation, leadership and action in strategy which can alone wrest the initiative from Fascism and ensure speediest victory.
</p>
<p>
Nor is it true, as is sometimes said, that the expressions of criticism represent only an unreasoning dissatisfaction or searching for scapegoats in the face of temporary reverses, when such reverses need to be counted on in the ups and downs of the severe ordeal of war to be met with strengthened determination. The readiness and ability of the British people to meet the heaviest reverses and difficulties without weakening, and with only reinforced resolution, is unquestionable. The dissatisfaction is specific, and expresses the sense of definite and avoidable inadequacies of preparedness, organisation, policy or leadership.
</p>
<p>
The millions of soldiers &#8220;browned off,&#8221; as they find themselves condemned to prolonged inactivity, with no prospect of facing the enemy or to soul-destroying &#8220;spit-and-polish&#8221; routine, while our allies are carrying forward the decisive battles of history against Fascism on the Eastern European front and calling in vain for our participation. Or the soldiers overseas who find themselves again and again compelled to meet the enemy without adequate equipment or aircraft protection. The millions of workers in war industry, chafing against enforced idle time and unused or half-used machines or waste of their skill, or told by the foreman &#8220;to look as if they were doing something&#8221; when a royal inspection takes place. The women eager to offer their services, and met with vague dilatory answers from harassed administrative officials and assurances that there is &#8220;no work.&#8221; The small manufacturers vainly seeking for orders for their plant, and finding themselves up against the entrenchments of the ring of monopolists in possession who snugly dominate the war controls and even openly restrict production. The younger officers, eager to respond to the new requirements of technique and strategy of a war of ceaseless innovation, and finding themselves powerless to storm the fortifications of the no less firmly entrenched, old-fashioned military caste which similarly choked off the De Gaulles in France and led France to ruin. A whole generation awakening to political life and awareness in this titanic conflict and finding themselves paralysed and thwarted by the reactionary forces entrenched in the governing party machinery and parliament. Restrictions of democratic expression, and the prohibition of the only newspaper not owned by the millionaires. The millions of colonial peoples frozen off from participation in a struggle which determines their fate, and which is regarded as only the affair of their masters, with their role to be the pawns and spoils of the victor. The placid settlements of rentier parasites (with their families prudently evacuated to the United States or Canada) in the spas or &#8220;safe&#8221; resorts, living on the fat of the land, and complaining that the war in the Far East has been brought home to them because it has restricted their supply of golf balls, while the soldiers&#8217; dependents are struggling to exist or selling their household furniture, and the railwayman toils through the black-out for his three pounds a week. All this is the other side of the medal of England at war to-day.
</p>
<p>
And all this, alongside the desperate admitted urgency of the war situation.
</p>
<p>
Is it surprising that emulous comparisons with the war effort of the Soviet Union begin to be made, not merely by representatives of the left, who have long recognised the distinctive strength of the social and political system of the Soviet Union, but by representatives of the right, who have previously disparaged that system as supposedly inefficient and not based on the will of the people. It is a Churchill who, in the hour of crisis after the fall of Singapore, holds up the example of the unbreakable national unity of the Soviet people in the face of reverses as a model for the British people. It is the organs of the millionaire press which, with rueful references to previous laughter at the Five Year Plans, hold up Soviet war production as a model of efficiency from which British business men should learn.
</p>
<p>
It took only a few weeks for the two hundred millions of the Soviet Union, thrust from the midst of peace into the midst of war by Hitler&#8217;s treacherous aggression, to mobilise all the resources of their country, and to mobilise every man, woman and child against the barbarous total war of Fascism. The entire people have risen as one to meet the enemy. They have stood up to an onslaught the like of which has never before been known in war, and within six months moved to their counter-offensive. All the representatives of every shade of opinion in the democratic countries have paid tribute to the epic example of this people who know no quislings; to their unbreakable national unity of will and action; their creative energy and miracle of achievement equally in the factories and at the front; to the way in which they have gone through an ordeal without equal, with the long retreat, the devastation of their territories and the infinite barbarism of the invader, and emerged, at the very moment when the experts on both sides were proclaiming their annihilation, to thrust back at the enemy with unquenchably renewed and ever rising confidence, vigour and resolution.
</p>
<p>
Yet here in Britain in the third year of the war, in a country with great initial advantages and resources and with a long tradition of leadership in the world, we are still struggling with heavy obstacles which cripple our effort.
</p>
<p>
Undoubtedly, it is true that there can be no close analogy between the Soviet Union and this country. Our conditions and problems are in many respects different. The Soviet people are strong, not merely because of what they are achieving to-day, but because of what they have achieved for a quarter of a century. They were able to establish from the outset a planned and unified war production, free from conflicting interests, and comparatively without difficulty and without delay, despite the heavy technical obstacles through the enemy occupation and the devastation of key industrial regions, because they had already built up a planned economy through twenty-three years of arduous reconstruction of the whole basis of ownership and organisation in industry and agriculture and through the laborious experience of three Five Year Plans. They are able to display a unity greater than any other people can immediately reach, because they have already in peace-time built up a society free from the division of classes and realising the equality of all the races and nations within it and the complete equality of men and women. They entered the war with those advantages. We have to wage the war without those advantages. We cannot undo in the twinkling of an eye the neglect of twenty years or make good what we should have achieved in the years of peace. With our existing forces and resources, with the nation at the stage of development it has to-day reached, we have to organise our war effort in the present urgent immediate conflict. Inheriting all the obstacles of a society based on the division of classes, and of the anarchy and monopoly interests of privately owned industry, we have to find the way to organise the united endeavour of the nation, and of all sections of the nation, in the war effort, and the most efficient organisation of the war effort, in such a way as to overcome and break down the crippling influence of sectional interests. The task is not easy, but it can be accomplished, and its accomplishment is the condition of victory. The difficulty only means that our effort must be the greater.
</p>
<p>
The British-Soviet Pact brought Britain out of the dangerous isolation in Europe which the previous policy of hostility to the Soviet Union, refusal of the Pact when it was offered before the war, and neglect of collective security had caused. It brought a profound change in the situation and the character of the war, and the birth of new hope and confidence and energy throughout the nation.
</p>
<p>
These hopes have received their measure of fulfilment with the establishment of the world coalition against Hitler and the consequent shifting of the balance of world forces to the disadvantage of Fascism.
</p>
<p>
Yet the hopes and enthusiasm which greeted the great changes of the summer of 1941 have been in part sapped and weakened by the policies of passivity, and have given place to renewed disquiet and questioning.
</p>
<p>
This was further intensified by the serious reverses in the Far East. Indeed, never was questioning more acute than in the early months of 1942 over the whole position and prospect of Britain in the war, over all the questions of strategy and organisation. The reconstruction of the Government in February, 1942, was a measure of reflection of this demand for a new and strengthened approach.
</p>
<p>
This deep concern, this sense of a crisis of the British people, is by no means confined to popular opinion. It finds its reflection equally in ruling class opinion. Consciousness of a deep inner bankruptcy, the fear of the looming possibility of the collapse and loss of the Empire, haunts ruling class expression.
</p>
<p>
Thus on February 21, 1942, the <em>Times</em> published an editorial which bears already something of the character of an obituary notice of the old Britain. It wrote:
</p>
<p class="quote">
&#8220;For a hundred years before 1914, Great Britain occupied a position of unparalleled greatness and prosperity. In the war of 1914-18 she enjoyed the powerful support of allies and associates; yet when the armistice sounded she could feel with justification that she had been the leader of the coalition and that hers had been the major share in the victory. Not only did this rightful consciousness of a glorious tradition in the past create an undue sense of security and ascendancy in the present: it also bred a blind and deep-seated belief, all the stronger for being rooted in instinct and rarely explicit in words, that the same methods which had hitherto produced these satisfactory results could be relied on to produce the same results in the future. Hence the unreasoned and almost unconscious resistance to innovation which has dominated national policy, domestic and international, military and economic, in an era of world-wide change.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Similarly the <em>Economist</em>, February 21, 1942, on the same theme wrote:
</p>
<p class="quote">
&#8220;The British people have been wonderfully patient under the long string of disasters and disappointments. But they are getting very tired of always losing&#8212;and usually losing so badly. In the whole history of the war, the British Army has not a single success of any importance to its credit&#8212;unless it be the very Pyrrhic triumphs of Dunkirk or the very temporary gains in Libya. True, it has had a great deal of bad luck&#8212;but the good general does not have bad luck. True, it has been short of equipment, but production is now very large. True, shipping is scarce, but it could have been less scarce if the imports of food had been reduced as drastically as the situation has demanded for several months past. And in any case, all of these excuses in combination do not explain what happened at Singapore. The dispatch from Batavia in Tuesday&#8217;s Times was the most terrifying document that has appeared in print for many years. &#8216;Soft&#8217; troops, unenterprising commanders, outwitted strategists, and incompetent administration, an apathetic native population&#8212;these are not the signs of a gallant army betrayed only by bad luck; they sound uncomfortably like the dissolution of an Empire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And further:
</p>
<p class="quote">
&#8220;It is not the armed forces alone that require the reformer&#8217;s zeal. Nowhere in the world is a scorched earth policy more necessary than in Whitehall. With rare exceptions, the present process of government is one of interminable delays, resulting in ridiculous compromises. The faculty of decision has been lost. . . .&#8221;
</p>
<p class="quote">
&#8220;It is a base libel to represent Britain as a tired but dogged sexagenarian with no prospect after successful defence save an honourable retirement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
These expressions are symptomatic of the severe self-questioning which has arisen, the sense of the dying days and bankruptcy of a whole r&#233;gime.
</p>
<p>
This is not the place to pursue the deeper issues raised by these critics. The decisive question at this moment is not the question of the basic weakness of the old traditional society in Britain, and the basic reconstruction which will have undoubtedly to take place. The decisive question now is how, in spite of the obstacles arising from this inherited structure of the old society, to organise our forces, to-day and not to-morrow, for the defeat of Nazism. In proportion as we fulfil this task, we shall be the stronger to deal with the deeper evils.
</p>
<p>
What stands in the way? What holds back the full mobilisation of the people, in order to overcome the present weaknesses and disorganisation and exert our full strength?
</p>
<p>
Many of the obstacles arise from the legacy of the past, the deadweight of past reactionary policies and inherited institutions and forms of organisation which still exercise a paralysing influence and hamper the war effort.
</p>
<p>
It would fall outside the scope of this book to go into the causes which have led us into the present mess. The inter-war years, under the rule of the Baldwins, MacDonalds, Chamberlains and Montagu Normans, were not happy years in the history of the British people. They were years of lost opportunities: of a profound social and economic decline, reflected in chronic mass unemployment, derelict areas and the decay of the basic industries, alongside tightening monopoly and growing parasitism; of reaction at home, expressed in the domination of Conservatism for eighteen out of the twenty-one inter-war years; of a reactionary colonial policy, most sharply expressed in the worsening relations with India; and of a reactionary foreign policy, destroying the weak attempts at a collective peace system, pursuing hostility to the Soviet Union, rebuilding the military power of German reaction, and supporting the enemies of the people and opposing popular advance in all countries: all culminating in the present war. Nor was the labour movement ready to take over leadership and carry through the changes that were necessary: the hostility of the ruling class to the Soviet Union was paralleled by the vendetta against Communism within the labour movement; and the divided labour movement proved unable to check the course of reaction.
</p>
<p>
To-day we are having to pay a heavy price for the legacy of these lost years. We are not only having to pay it in the difficulties of the international situation whose outcome has been the present war and the reverses in the war. We are having to pay for it in economic life, with the stranglehold of the monopolies on production, the dismantled shipyards, the restricted productive machinery, the neglected acres of the countryside, the loss of skilled labour. We are having to pay for it in the political field, with the still powerful role in parliament and in political life of those who were responsible for the old pro-fascist policies, as they were responsible for the policies of economic restriction, and whose continued influence has been seen in the pouring out of millions of pounds to a Franco, the privileges of a Mosley, the protracted unwillingness to declare war on Hitler&#8217;s satellites in Europe, and the tenacious opposition to an active anti-Hitler strategy and combined offensive with the Soviet Union in Europe. We are having to pay for it in the colonial sphere, where the results have made themselves sharply felt by all in the Far East, and where even the urgent need, with the enemy at the gates, to reach a basis of cooperation with the Indian people to enable them to mobilise their defence as a co-partner of the United Nations has been resisted and has so far met with an alarming breakdown. We are having to pay for it in the whole sphere of administration, with a bureaucracy still dominated by the old Munichite chiefs paralysing initiative and speedy action. We are having to pay for it in the military field, with the unpreparedness in armaments, the effects of the resistance to mechanisation, the dominance of reaction in the High Command and opposition to innovation and new strategic conceptions.
</p>
<p>
The past cannot be changed. But we can change the present. We can and must ruthlessly clear away every obstacle from reactionary past policies which stands in the way of present needs. We must be prepared to make far-reaching changes without hesitation in accordance with war needs. There can be no room in politics or in any commanding positions for those who hold responsibility for the old pro-fascist policies: to play with this question is to ask for trouble. In the economic sphere we must establish effective control and a united plan of war production which will override the resistance of monopolies and vested interests. In the colonial policy we need a new approach, the first step in which must be partnership with a free India. We must establish working class unity as the essential basis of democratic strength: in the labour movement there is neither room for the outlook of the bourbons of the right, who, on the basis of old antagonisms, oppose such unity to-day; nor for the bourbons of the former left, who fail to understand the urgency of the present struggle and the necessity of national unity for victory. In every sphere, in administration, in government and in the military command we need to make room for the advance of new forces and new methods, capable of overcoming the old routine and responding to the new needs, close to the people, resolutely anti-fascist in outlook and able to carry forward the struggle against Fascism to victory.
</p>
<p>
Alongside the legacies of the past, there is a second factor which exercises a hampering effect on all sections of the nation&#8212;the fear of the future. In a society which has been built up on the basis of every individual looking after his own interests, on trade competition, sectional antagonism and class division, the call to sacrifice individual interests to national need inevitably gives rise to hesitations, doubts, divided loyalties and incomplete response, not merely through the continuance of old outlooks and direct selfish resistance, but also through genuine and serious concern and anxiety for the future. Employers and managers in industry, compelled to consider the interests of their firm or their shareholders, respond to the national call with a divided loyalty, when they are simultaneously judging every new proposal and development with one eye on how it will affect the future interests of their firm, its hold on the market, its future trading position, or, with the memory of the sequel to the last war, fear the extension of production because they are haunted by the spectre of excess capacity after the war. Similarly the workers and trade unions, eager to respond to the appeal for maximum production, but with bitter memories of the sequel of the last war, are held back in agreeing to necessary changes in practices, sacrifice of old safeguards and hard-won positions, extension of training or the use of semi-skilled workers and the introduction of women in industry, because they fear the effects in the consequent weakening of their bargaining position in the economic struggle after the war. The women who are called on to give their services in the war effort, break home ties and enter production, view with anxiety their prospect after the war, in view of the experience which followed the last war, when the women who had responded to the call for war service were unceremoniously thrust aside from the jobs they had been temporarily called on to fulfil, and there was no further use for their training and capacity. In the same way the farmers, with no less bitter memories of the promises to agriculture at the end of the last war, hesitate to give full co-operation in the urgently needed maximum extension of production on the land, because they fear the situation which they foresee with the withdrawal of government support and the collapse of agricultural prices after the war.
</p>
<p>
Thus the fear of the post-war position becomes a factor paralysing the maximum effort in the war. Preoccupation with post-war prospects becomes the enemy of victory in the war, and could thus finally lead, if given free play, to the very outcome most feared, that is, the worst possible post-war position&#8212;defeat by Fascism.
</p>
<p>
We must overcome these paralysing doubts and fears; first by firmly recognising that the paramount necessity at the present moment, overriding every sectional interest, is the defeat of Fascism, on which depends the future prospect of every section of the nation; second, by recognising that the measure of strength of democratic response, initiative and organisation in tackling the present needs of the war is the best guarantee and the only finally effective guarantee for effectively tackling the problems of the post-war world in such a way that the experiences which followed the last war shall not be repeated; and, finally by such provisional guarantees (as with regard to the restoration of Trade Union rights or with regard to future agricultural development) as can assist in mitigating the anxieties felt.
</p>
<p>
A third factor hampering the national effort and will to victory consists in the hindrances to national unity consequent on the existing social and political structure&#8212;the glaring inequality of sacrifice, the war profiteering (which the mockery of the 100 per cent. excess profits tax does not camouflage&#8212;for the right to declare dividends of 50 per cent. or 100 per cent. on the grounds that similar dividends were already being made at the height of the pre-war arms racket can hardly be dismissed as the abolition of war profiteering, while the public are awake to the trickery of financial reserves, undistributed profits, and similar devices), the class discrimination in the services and in the call-up, the injustices in the practical working of partial food rationing with the continuance of the luxury hotels and restaurants, the hardships of many soldiers&#8217; dependants, etc. Here it is necessary to face brutal facts frankly. We have to fight Fascism with the existing society of a class-divided nation; we threw away the chance to make a basic social reconstruction during the past twenty years, such as the Russians have carried out, and cannot now carry through this gigantic task overnight in the midst of the fight against Fascism, when it is necessary to rally all sections for the common struggle. But this only makes it the more necessary that we can and must carry through the most radical democratic measures for diminishing the inequalities, for really curbing profiteering and luxury expenditure, for all-round rationing, for protecting the health and standards of the people, for democratic changes in the armed services, and for working towards the aims of equality of sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
A fourth factor paralysing the national will is unclearness of aim. The question &#8220;What are we fighting for?&#8221; is still often heard. Neither the record of the ruling class during the past ten years since Hitler came to power, nor the extremely contradictory declarations of Government spokesmen and official propaganda, are calculated to inspire the confidence of the people in the present struggle as a democratic struggle against Fascism and for the victory of the freedom of the peoples. Every sign of weakness or hesitancy in effective collaboration with the Soviet Union, of a conciliatory attitude to fascist regimes abroad or hostility to anti-fascist refugees, or opposition to recognising the claims to freedom of the colonial peoples, strengthens the doubts and suspicions.
</p>
<p>
The Soviet people have no difficulty in knowing what they are fighting for. The statements of Stalin lack nothing in concreteness. But it would be possible to compile a long list of statements of Government Ministers in Britain showing the most extreme contradictions on vital issues, e.g., the question of whether the war is against German Fascism or against the German people as a whole. Yet clearness of aim is the indispensable condition for the united mobilisation of the people and the will to victory.
</p>
<p>
The aims of the fight against Fascism, the ruthless exposure of what Fascism means and why its defeat is a life-and-death necessity for humanity, the aims of the victory of the freedom of the peoples and of the establishment of world peace as indicated in broad principle in the Atlantic Charter, need to be proclaimed in plain and concrete terms which can win the confidence and enthusiasm of the masses of the people. The aims of a conflict can only correspond to the forces waging it and directing its policy; and the clearness of aim of a democratic anti-fascist struggle can only be ensured by strengthening the representation in the Government and in all commanding positions of the most determined anti-fascist fighters who are capable of expressing the view-point of the millions in the war factories and the armed services.
</p>
<p>
All these factors underlie the tendencies to passivity, or lack of conviction, drive, 100 per cent effort or fighting spirit, of which complaint is often made. This passivity, running through many spheres of the war effort, both above and below, finds expression in a whole series of fields: in strategy; in production; in administration; in the political mobilisation of the people.
</p>
<p>
Representatives returning from the Soviet Union, whether statesmen, diplomatists, generals, or journalists have all borne witness to the difference of atmosphere of which they are conscious on their return: the absence of the same sense of urgency and all-out effort of the people. Petty preoccupations which reflect the absence of this sense of urgency and responsibility; sectional considerations, the tendency to regard the conflict as some natural cataclysm which has impinged on daily life, but is the concern and responsibility of those in control rather than our concern; negative criticism of those in authority, without the determination and activity to make the necessary changes; idle speculation on the post-war future; the old complacent calculations that &#8220;we are bound to win,&#8221; that &#8220;it will all come right in the end,&#8221; without special effort on our part, that someone else somewhere will do the job for us, that &#8220;Fascism will collapse,&#8221; that &#8220;Russia will win the war for us,&#8221; that &#8220;America&#8217;s vast resources makes victory certain&#8221;&#8212;all these tendencies which are the expression of passivity are still strong.
</p>
<p>
The task of overcoming this passivity is not an easy one, for it has deep roots in the past. It is bound up with the whole tradition and social-political structure of this country. For generations the unchallenged world monopoly and world leadership of Britain bred the assumption, instilled into the people by the ruling class, of a natural ordained and automatic superiority and privileged position without special effort; that no world events or catastrophes of other nations could really touch the stability and favoured immunity of this country; the lion might sometimes slumber, but he had only to stir anew to shake the world and re-assert his kingship. Only slowly does the awakening consciousness begin to break through that the old world situation is changed for ever; that Britain is no longer the foremost or strongest Power in the world; that the old sheltered immunity is gone; and that the issue of a struggle for national existence can seriously arise.
</p>
<p>
Similarly for generations the wars of British policy were conducted with skillfully constructed coalitions of allies, who bore the brunt of the fighting, while the hostilities were conducted on the soil of other nations. Only the war of 1914-18 brought the first shock, compelling heavy sacrifice of blood and life from the people of this country on a continental scale (though not proportionately as heavily as France or Germany or Russia); but even then there was not really a comparably serious threat to the island immunity; the French army remained intact; the enemy never held Paris or Calais; nor had air-power begun to balance sea-power; and the final victorious outcome strengthened the assumption of automatic victory.
</p>
<p>
The privileged economic position on the basis of the tribute of Empire and the export of capital all over the world bred parasitism in the life of the nation. This was reflected in the decline of the basic industries, the growth of the rentier class, and the growth of every form of non-productive service, salesmanship, the luxury service of the rentiers, etc. Characteristic of the modern period was the rapid multiplication of the so-called &#8220;new middle class,&#8221; divorced from the traditions and habits of common action of either the ruling class or the working class; living standardised lives in the no less rapidly multiplying standardised suburbs of the great towns; taught and trained by their whole conditions of life to seek &#8220;safety first&#8221;; and constituting the vast reservoir of passivity and apathy, the natural basis of Baldwinism and Chamberlainism.
</p>
<p>
For generations the people have been taught to look to a narrow and compact governing class&#8212;in which the names of a few families, or of the products of a handful of schools recur for generations in the leading offices of State, and into which the ambitious and successful newcomers in politics in each generation have been rapidly and effectively drawn&#8212;to direct the mysteries of State and control the conduct of administration. The one great popular assault on the entrenchments of privilege, Chartism, was beaten down and broken so completely that even its memory became dim and almost unknown to the sons and grandsons of the Chartists. There followed the long period of economic prosperity, in which liberalism was able to hold the workers under the sway of the ideas and politics of their masters, so that it was for long deemed impossible for a political party of the working class to arise in England. With the traditions of &#8220;public service&#8221; of the leisured ruling class, every sphere of national life, religion, culture, education, sports, youth organisation, has been directed and organised for the people by the representatives of the gentlemen, who set the tone, established the standards and philanthropically supervised the practice, so that the very forms of activity, ideas, and entertainments of the people were conducted along lines prescribed for them by their masters. There was another side to this picture, which found expression in the self-made organisations of the people, the trade unions and co-operatives; but these in nineteenth century England were still limited in scope, reaching only to a minority, and did not venture to challenge the ascendancy of the ruling class in the great issues of public affairs. The gradual advance of democratic reforms and extension of the franchise did not basically change this traditional aristocratic or oligarchic character of English politics and English society. The alternation of the &#8220;ins&#8221; and the &#8220;outs&#8221; of the two ruling parties left the same narrow ruling circle in control, while the people were privileged as spectators to cheer their favourites and at lengthy intervals of years appeared for a day as nominal sovereigns to determine such issues as it was agreed to place before them.

The growth of the political labour movement in the twentieth century represented the first advance of the movement of the people to take the initiative into their own hands in public affairs. But during the past quarter of a century the same gulf between leadership and rank-and-file has appeared, with a vast mass membership, formal democracy within certain limitations, but active participation of only a small minority, so that the politically active have remained a handful, while the bulk of the membership have remained passive, voting faithfully at elections, but seldom attending meetings of their organisations to take part in the formation of policy and control of decisions. The official system of bans and division during the recent period, with the exclusion and partial disfranchisement of the militant left wing, has intensified this tendency to passivity and stagnation, so that the advance towards greater unity and political activity of the workers has had to proceed against heavy obstacles.

In the critical years before the war the overwhelming majority of public opinion in this country was strongly antifascist, opposed to Hitler and Mussolini, hated the Chamberlain policies of conciliation to Fascism, supported collective security and approved the idea of an Anglo-Soviet Pact. Every testing of the evidence showed this again and again. The Peace Ballot in 1935, with its eleven million vote for collective security, disturbed ruling class circles. The 1935 elections had to be carried out on a basis of plain deception, with the proclamation of an anti-fascist League programme to win a majority, in order to carry out a Chamberlain programme of appeasement to Fascism and sabotage of the League. In the spring of 1939 a Gallup poll showed an 87 per cent. majority for an Anglo-Soviet military pact, at the same time as the Government was declaring that the adoption of such a Pact would fatally divide Europe into two ideological camps and was preparing to propose a thousand million pound loan to Hitler as the better way. Yet this overwhelming public majority opinion for the plain policy which would have been capable of preventing the present war was never able to make itself effective against the narrow unpopular Chamberlain Cliveden clique. The campaign for a union of the popular forces to defeat Chamberlain and ensure the alternative policy in time was able to organise great and enthusiastic demonstrations, but was not able to mobilise a decisive political majority. The mighty labour movement remained unmoved. The giant forces of passivity, strengthened by the inaction of the labour movement, won the battle for the hated and unpopular Chamberlain.

To-day the crisis is serious in the final degree. There is no room for passivity. There are no more last chances. A new approach is necessary, a break with old forms and paralysing limitations, a drastic change in the whole outlook and way of life in this country, a rousing of the energies and initiative of the masses of the people in a way that has never been done before. The many-million-strong working class movement has a prime responsibility in this to play the part that it can play, in every factory, in every locality, in every decision of national policy. The people must act or perish. This war is like no other war. The existence of the working class movement, the existence of democracy in any part of the world, the existence and future of socialism, of human progress and the freedom of peoples is at stake before the universal night of darkness with which Fascism threatens to engulf the world. The methods of this war are like no other war. The entire strength of organised populations, military, economic, industrial, moral and political, are thrown into the field. We cannot conduct this war on the principle of limited liability. Victory or extinction&#8212;these are the alternatives equally for Fascism and for the cause of popular freedom. The same superhuman energy, creative initiative and universal mobilisation which the Soviet people have been able to demonstrate, we must achieve in this country also. We must and can overcome every obstacle that stands in the way of this. We dare not fail.
