<h3>Britain in the World Front</h3>

<hr class="base" size="1">
<h4>Chapter VI</h4>
<h3>India and the Colonial Peoples</h3>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<p class="fst">
BRITAIN holds a special responsibility in the World Alliance to assist in winning the free and full collaboration of the Indian people and the colonial peoples.
</p>
<p>
Fascism is the enemy of all peoples in the world&#8212;equally of those who have already won a greater or less degree of freedom and self-government and of those who are still held subject under colonial rule. The aims of the struggle for freedom of the twelve hundred millions of humanity who live in India, China, Eastern Asia and the Pacific, the Middle East and Africa require the victory of the world anti-fascist alliance and the complete defeat of fascism. But the mobilisation of these gigantic reserves of the anti-fascist army will only be effective to the extent that their willing collaboration is won on the basis of their own understanding of their own interests, as voluntary allies, and not as servants called on to give their lives in the interests of their masters. The question of the freedom of the colonial peoples is no longer only a first-class political issue. It is a first-class strategic issue for the victory of the democratic anti-fascist alliance.
</p>
<p> 
Fascism&#8217;s war aims are openly directed against the colonial peoples: against India; against the former colonial country of China, which Fascism seeks to subjugate anew; against the peoples of Eastern Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Mussolini&#8217;s war of conquest and plunder against Abyssinia and Japan&#8217;s invasion and conquest of Manchuria and Northern China opened the fascist war offensive. Hitler&#8217;s drive towards the Middle East and India, strategic concentration in Northern Africa, and Fifth Column penetration in South Africa and South America, and Japan&#8217;s lightning military conquest of Eastern Asia and extending advance to India and Australia, are the expression of the expansionist drive of Fascism for the carving out of the new fascist empires over the bodies of all the colonial peoples of the world, no less than of the free democratic peoples.
</p>
<p> 
Fascism seeks to mask these designs of aggression, plunder and conquest behind a smokescreen of hypocritical slogans about the liberation of the colonial peoples from their present rulers. Japan puts out the slogan &#8220;Asia for the Asiatics!&#8221;&#8212;by which they mean &#8220;Asia for the Japanese War Lords!&#8221; The Annual Report of the German General Staff in 1939, already before the war, emphasised the importance of supporting every freedom movement anywhere in the British Empire as a means of securing a strategic foothold. Wherever adventurist, mercenary or misguided individuals can be found from the national liberation movements in the colonial countries, like Bose who was expelled from the Indian National Congress, Rashid Ali from Iraq or the Grand Mufti from Palestine, these are taken into the service of Fascism and exploited as fascist propaganda agents to confuse and mislead the masses in the colonial countries.
</p>
<p>
The colonial peoples have every reason to understand that Fascism is to-day their deadliest and most dangerous enemy, and that the interests of their struggle for liberation are bound up with the victory of the world anti-fascist alliance and the destruction of Fascism. All the most responsible and enlightened leaders of the national liberation movements have recognised that the interests of the colonial peoples are irreconcilably opposed to Fascism. The Chinese National Republic has fought with arms against the Japanese fascist invaders for years before the formation of the world anti-fascist alliance. The Indian National Congress has played an outstanding and honourable role in the vanguard of the struggle against Fascism, in support of China, Abyssinia and Spain, for years before the ruling authorities in this country began to move from their policies of conciliation to Fascism.
</p>
<p>
The world victory of fascist barbarism would mean the destruction for a long period of all hopes of freedom of the colonial peoples. Heavy as is the lot of the colonial peoples under the existing imperialist rule, it would be immeasurably worse under Fascism, which is the most aggressive and brutal form of imperialism. Every imperialist system means the oppression and degradation, the arresting of development of the subject peoples under its rule. The aim of every colonial people can only be for complete liberation from imperialism. But in the existing types of colonial r&#233;gime the mass struggle has already won in the majority of cases a varying measure of rights of organisation and political expression (trade unions, political organisation, press, despite heavy restrictions and intimidation) which, though limited and precarious, are of the utmost importance for further advance, and which would be completely swept away under Fascism. On the other hand, the development and victory of the world anti-fascist alliance represents the most favourable conditions for the complete liberation of the colonial peoples.
</p>
<p>
The principles of the fascist colonial system (already exemplified in the Japanese reign of terror in Manchuria and the occupied provinces of China) have been expressed with unconcealed brutality in the publications of the Nazi colonial office, which glorify the bloodthirsty Dr. Peters as the model colonial ruler. Reference may be made to the authoritative exposition of Dr. G&#252;nther Hecht, expert for racial colonial problems in the racial-political office of the National-Socialist Party, under the title &#8220;The Colonial Question and Racial Thought&#8221;, published in 1938, which lays down the racial principles intended to govern the future treatment of natives by the Nazi rulers.
</p>
<p>
Fascist colonial theories, drenched in racial chauvinism, pour contempt on what they term the pernicious humanitarian conceptions of the colonial system of the Western democratic Powers, which they declare, by opening the doors of European culture to the colonial peoples, sow the seeds for the disintegration of the colonial system. As against this, they state that Nazi rule will finally root out all such conceptions and establish the permanent inferior status of the colonial peoples. Fascism, with its pretence of Aryan superiority, assigns to the coloured people the status of human slaves. Higher schools and universities must be closed to them; no native of a Nazi colony must be allowed to travel outside it to Europe. The Nazi racial law must be extended to the colonies.
</p>
<p>
Blindness to what fascist victory would mean for the colonial peoples would be equivalent to betrayal of the interests of the colonial peoples.
</p>
<p>
Against this menace the victory of the world front of the peoples fighting to defeat fascist enslavement represents the hope of all colonial and semi-colonial peoples of the world. The Soviet Union has always been recognised by the subject peoples of the world as the pioneer and protagonist of the liberty and equality of oppressed peoples. In the free union of nations composing the Soviet Union, as <em>Pravda</em> wrote on May 1, 1941, &#8220;the dead, ideology dividing man into &#8216;higher and lower&#8217; races has been thrown onto the rubbish heap of history.&#8221; The freedom and equality won and enjoyed by the former oppressed peoples of the Tsarist Empire, the assistance which the Soviet Union has given to peoples struggling for national freedom, such as the Turkish, Spanish and Chinese peoples, and the insistence of the Soviet Union on equality in foreign relations, shown by the scrapping of the old grasping Tsarist treaties with China and Iran, have won respect and admiration throughout the world. The Chinese National Republic represents the vanguard of the national liberation movements of the world. There can be no question where the hopes and sympathies of all colonial peoples lie in this conflict.
</p>
<p>
But the effective participation of the colonial peoples in the world anti-fascist front cannot depend on their own efforts alone. The reactionary obstacles which still hinder that full participation must be removed. And here a special responsibility lies on the peoples in the imperialist countries participating in the anti-fascist coalition, and above all on the people of Britain, at the centre of the British Empire, with its four hundred and fifty millions of subject colonial peoples.
</p>
<p>
Reactionary policy in relation to India, Burma, Ceylon and all the colonial peoples has deeply injured and weakened the anti-fascist front.
</p>
<p>
The Indian people and all the colonial peoples represent a gigantic reservoir of democratic and anti-fascist strength. Their man-power is vast. Their resources are abundant in all the raw materials for war. Their will to freedom, their capacity for struggle and sacrifice, demonstrated in their national struggles, could play a powerful role in the common front and the common victory, and in Asia the decisive role.
</p>
<p>
Yet barely the fringe of this man-power and of these resources has so far been mobilised. Their democratic willingness has been repulsed and discouraged. In India the army so far raised amounts to one million men out of a population of nearly four hundred millions; recruitment is limited; masses are turned away from the recruiting offices.
</p> 
<p class="quote">
&#8220;There is no lack of men; since the outbreak of war recruiting offices all over the country have been congested with volunteers from every class, community and occupation to such an extent that it soon became impossible to deal with their numbers.&#8221;<br />
(&#8220;India At War&#8221; Government Report, 1941).
</p>
<p>
In proportion to population the man-power would provide twice the armed forces of the Soviet Union. On the Canadian scale of recruitment, it would provide fifteen to twenty millions. The actual outcome is one quarter of one per cent of the population, or a total less than that of a secondary European State. Even this figure has been stated to be &#8220;largely a paper figure. Arms are lacking for the training of a mass army, and as a  result recruiting,	until	recently, was rather discouraged&#8221; (Military Correspondent of the &#8220;Observer,&#8221; March 8, 1942). The Chinese example has shown the possibility, under national leadership, of organising and training armies even with limited resources, capable of meeting the Japanese armies; but the Chinese Command&#8217;s offer to send military instructors to India to assist in solving the problem of training has not so far been accepted.
</p>
<p>
Similarly in respect of resources and war production. India has abundant resources of all the key raw materials for war production, with the exception of nickel, molybdenum and vanadium. But only the tiniest fraction is utilised. With coal reserves of 36,000 million tons, the annual production before the war reached 25 million tons, or one-tenth of the British level; and coal output dropped in 1940. With iron ore reserves of 3,000 million tons, the output of steel on the eve of war was not yet one million tons, or one-thirteenth of the British level, and below the level of Poland. By 1941 steel output had advanced to one and a quarter million tons: &#8220;the expansion might have been larger, but . . . we are large importers of pig iron from India. It would have meant absorbing in India pig iron which was urgently required for our industry here&#8221; (the Duke of Devonshire, Under-Secretary for India, in the House of Lords, February 3, 1942). Thus shipping, urgently needed for war transport between Britain and the Far East, is used to transport pig iron from India to Britain and finished steel back to India, rather than manufacture in India. There is no motor industry and no aero-engine industry; India is dependent on overseas supply for all its heavy weapons: planes, tanks and heavy artillery. Yet India with industrial development could have been the arsenal of the war in the Far East. The Government announced in the House of Commons on October 9, 1941, that the manufacture of internal-combustion engines in India would not be &#8220;a practical proposition so far as the present war is concerned.&#8221; By the spring of 1942, after two and a half years of war, it was announced that an exploratory commission was being appointed &#8220;to examine the question of production of components of internal-combustion engines or complete engines.&#8221; Indian industrialists have vociferously complained that, in contrast to the gigantic industrial development in the Dominions since the war, industrial development in India has received a setback. &#8220;Unlike the last war, there has been very little industrial expansion" ("Great Britain and the East,&#8221; June 19, 1941).
</p>
<p>
The gigantic available man-power for war production is thus scarcely used. Despite the inexhaustible resources of raw materials for industrial production, and the inexhaustible reserves of man-power, to-day after nearly two centuries of British rule in India not one per cent. of the population is employed in factories, mines, railways or docks. It was reported as an achievement in November, 1941, that 50,000 workers are now employed in the Government Ordnance Factories, or one in eight thousand of the population. By the end of 1941 two batches of <em>fifty</em> Indian workers each had arrived in Britain for industrial training&#8212;from a population of four hundred millions. And meanwhile the authorities here wring their hands over the problem of man-power.
</p>
<p>
This policy of throttling Indian industrial development, already criminal in peacetime against the interests and needs of the Indian people, becomes doubly criminal to-day against the vital needs of the World Alliance and equivalent to direct help to Fascism.
</p>
<p>
Behind this lies the influence of the entire policy of colonial domination and exploitation: the denial of national self-determination, the policy which would rather lose the colonial territories temporarily to the fascist invaders than yield power to the peoples themselves; the fear of too rapid advance of the colonial peoples, fear of their industrial development, fear of arming the people, fear of their inevitable advance to freedom.
</p>  
<p>
The consequences of this policy have been seen in Malaya and Singapore, in Java and Burma: where the Japanese invaders were able to sweep forward without popular resistance, or even with active support from sections of the population; where the Government, in the words of the <em>Times</em> report on Malaya, &#8220;had no roots in the life of the people&#8221; and &#8220;with the exception of certain sections of the Chinese community&#8212;some inspired by Free China&#8217;s struggle for survival, others by Soviet precept and example&#8212;the bulk of the Asiatic population remained spectators from start to finish&#8221;; where the great naval base of Singapore was paralysed because out of the 12,000 Asiatic labourers only 800 remained, while ships could not be unloaded or put to sea because the Asiatic dockers and crews were gone; where the populations were not mobilised or trained or armed to defend themselves, but where, in Burma, the Japanese could recruit and organise whole companies of soldiers for their own purposes.
</p>
<p>
A radical change of policy is imperative in relation to India and all the colonial peoples. The events in the Far East have brought a shock of twelfth hour awakening even to many who were previously indifferent to this question.
</p>
<p>
But the necessary concrete steps to effect such a change have still to be taken.
</p>   
<p>
The Atlantic Charter proclaimed the &#8220;right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live.&#8221; Mr. Attlee, in a speech to West African students on the day following its promulgation, declared, according to the <em>Daily Herald</em> of August 16, 1941, that &#8220;coloured peoples, as well as white, will share the benefits of the Churchill-Roosevelt Atlantic Charter.&#8221; The subsequent pronouncement of Mr. Churchill on September 9, 1941, specifically excluding the application of the Atlantic Charter from &#8220;India, Burma or any other parts of the British Empire&#8221;, and explaining that &#8220;we had in mind primarily the restoration of the sovereignty, self-government and national life of the States and nations of Europe,&#8221; was a blow in the face to the aspirations of India and the colonial peoples.
</p>
<p>
With the rapid collapse in the autocratically governed Burma, Malaya, Singapore, Java, etc., may be contrasted the relatively more prolonged resistance in the Philippines, where a large measure of self-government had been granted, with a Filipino President, Cabinet and elected National Assembly, and a fixed date for complete independence by 1945.
</p>
<p>
The power of national independence to inspire and mobilise a people to fight in their own defence has been shown for all time by the heroic example and leadership of Free China, which, in the face of a thousand obstacles and shortage of arms, equipment or developed productive resources, has been able for five years to maintain its successful and united resistance to the assault of Japan, and has now been able to send its soldiers to the assistance of other Asiatic nations.
</p>
<p>
The alliance of Free China and Free India must be the corner-stone of freedom and the fight for freedom in Eastern Asia. The advance of Japan to the gates of India has brought the question of Indian national freedom and self-defence to the forefront of world politics. It is essential that a basis of agreement should be found between the British Government and the representatives of the Indian people to make possible the willing cooperation of the Indian people, as equal partners in the alliance of the United Nations, for the common struggle against the common enemy. This basis of agreement can be found, provided that the present dictatorial system of government in India is replaced by the formation of a National Coalition Government, representative of Indian political leaders of all sections prepared to collaborate in the common cause, and with full responsibility and powers, subject to the practical requirements of military cooperation with Britain and the United Nations.
</p>
<p>
The failure of the Cripps Mission to India to reach an agreement on this basis represented a major strategical defeat for the alliance against Fascism. The Cripps Mission failed, not because agreement was impossible, but because it refused the elementary demand for the formation of a representative National Government to mobilise the Indian people for the common struggle. The breakdown did not arise over the hypothetical post-war scheme for the future political regulation of India; this scheme, so far from being an offer of self-government, was of a dubious and undemocratic character, since it refused the first basis of self-determination, that the democratically elected representatives of the Indian people should be free to determine their own form of government, and it included projects, both fantastic and unworkable, for the future balkanisation of India; but the Indian politicians were sufficiently realist to recognise that these post-war speculations were of minor practical importance to-day. Nor did the breakdown occur over the alleged communal difficulty and divisions of the Indian people; this question never arose in the discussions and was only subsequently produced as a supposed explanation of the breakdown. The explicit statement of Jawaharlal Nehru that &#8220;at no stage during the talks did any communal or minority difficulty occur&#8221; compelled the final admission by Sir Stafford Cripps that &#8220;it is quite true that I did not discuss the minority question with Congress&#8221; and that &#8220;it was not in form on the communal question that the breakdown came.&#8221; All sections of Indian political opinion demanded the formation of a responsible National Government, even though the composition of such a Government would have had to be the subject of subsequent negotiation. But this stage was never reached, because the principle was refused; it was made clear that, even if all sections were united in this demand, it would be refused. This was the cause of the breakdown.
</p>
<p>
Urgent steps need now to be taken to remedy this situation before it is too late. The refusal to concede a National Government to India has led to serious deterioration of the political situation in India, tendencies to disintegration and demoralisation, and the increased influence of the fatal tendencies to pacifism, passivity and theories of neutrality in this life-and-death struggle.
</p>
<p>
The greatest responsibility rests on democratic opinion in this country to do all in its power to remove the reactionary obstacles from the side of British policy in the way of a settlement; and to ensure that the Government immediately reopen negotiations with the Indian National Congress with a view to the formation of a representative and responsible National Government in India, capable of enjoying the confidence of the Indian people and mobilising them for active defence, in cooperation with the other nations opposed to fascist aggression. Pending the establishment of such a Government, all the thousands of anti-fascist prisoners (now mainly working class and peasant prisoners, socialists, communists and trade unionists, who would be in the forefront of rallying the nation for resistance against Fascism) should be immediately released, and every form of assistance should be given to the National Congress to rally and organise the resistance of the people to the Japanese attack. Further, the most urgent steps need to be taken to speed the development of Indian industry for war production, to assist with equipment, machine-tools, etc., from Britain and the United States, to harness the available small-scale industry and handicraft, and to mobilise the man-power for a mighty effort comparable with that of China.
</p>
<p>
In the Middle East the Treaty of Britain and the Soviet Union with Iran, guaranteeing Iran&#8217;s territorial integrity and independence in the spirit of the Atlantic Charter, represents a blow to the aims of Nazi penetration in these regions. The proclamation of the independent Syrian and Lebanon Republics, and the establishment of the Wafdist (Nationalist) Government in Egypt represent further important progressive steps for the furtherance of unity against Fascism. The way forward here lies through the Federation of the Arabian countries in common resistance to fascist aggression.
</p>
<p>
In the African colonial countries and in the West Indies the path of democratic anti-fascist advance needs to be pressed forward: in the West Indies, by the immediate establishment of full self-government; and in the African colonial countries, by the extension of civil rights, rights of organisation and press, release of political prisoners, removal of racial disabilities, minimum labour and social legislation, and economic assistance, in such a way as to encourage the initiative and active role of the African peoples as common participants in the struggle against Fascism. There must be no room in the countries associated with the anti-fascist alliance for the racial repressive laws and disabilities which in fact reproduce the principles at the basis of Nazism, and which are most actively pressed forward (as in South Africa) especially by the open adherents and admirers of the Nazi model, the Pirows, Malans and their associates. Failure of the democratic peoples to undertake an active fight on this issue can prepare a sequel in Africa as menacing as that already experienced in the Far East.
</p>
<p>
The colonial peoples in all the countries of the world represent a powerful force for freedom. They are the natural enemies of Fascism and all oppression and tyranny. It is for the peoples in the democratic countries to understand their strivings, and to find a way to forge their close alliance with these in the common struggle against the fascist aims of world domination. This struggle will prepare the conditions for the full liberation of all peoples and nations throughout the world.
