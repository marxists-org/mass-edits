<h3>Britain in the World Front</h3>

<hr class="base" size="1">
<h4>Chapter XII</h4>
<h3>The Labour Movement and the War</h3>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<p class="fst">
THE speediest victory of Britain and Britain&#8217;s allies over Hitler is not the special interest of one class or section of the nation, but the common interest of all classes and sections of the nation. This common aim unites widely differing classes and parties, however much they may be opposed on other issues, in a single common task, the organisation of the full strength of the nation for the defeat of Hitler. Just as the world alliance unites widely differing States and nations, so the counterpart of this unity of the world alliance is the unity of each nation composing the alliance. This national unity is indispensable for victory over Hitler. A divided nation opens the way to the victory of Hitler. A united nation ensures the maximum strength for the speediest defeat of Hitler.
</p>
<p>
This collaboration of all sections of the nation, of normally opposed classes, parties and organisations, constitutes the united national front for the defeat of Hitler. It finds expression in the united endeavour of the national war effort. In industry it finds expression in the co-operation of employers, management and workers for maximum war production. In the political field it finds expression in the co-operation of parties in parliament and in elections, and in the support of a Coalition Government of National Unity, based at present on the Conservative, Liberal and Labour Parties. The Government has received national support as the representative of national unity.
</p>
<p>
The weakness of the national front as at present developed is its formal character of a collaboration only of the official machines of the older parties; it makes no attempt to reach out to the vast web of organisations of the people, social, economic, sporting, religious or political, of youth or of women; it makes no attempt to draw in the practical participation of the masses of active men and women of all parties and of no party. Hence the tendencies of many men and worsen who are awakening to political life and interest in the conditions of the war and seeking new forms of political expression, to be drawn in the wake of the various new &#8220;independent&#8221; groupings which crop up like mushrooms, often with very dubious antecedents, and which in fact, whatever their professions, cut across and break up national unity. This has been noticeable in recent by-elections, where the obsolete and unsatisfactory system of selection of candidates to represent national unity, not on the basis of the combined choice of all the democratic organisations in the constituency supporting national unity, but by the nomination of a caucus of whichever of the older party machines regards the constituency as its &#8220;property&#8221; on the basis of a seven year-old claim, has led in several cases to a revolt of the electors, the defeat of Government candidates representing national unity and the return of &#8220;independent&#8221; candidates, although this by no means reflects opposition of the majority of electors to national unity for victory over Hitler. These tendencies are a dangerous warning-signal. The disruption of national unity, even though beginning under the impetus of progressive desires and impatience of a section of the electors, would in fact play into the hands of the powerful reactionary forces which carried through the old policies of conciliation to Fascism, which arc still heavily represented in the existing Conservative majority in parliament, and which, although not daring for the moment to proclaim their aims in the open, are on the look-out for any signs of the break-up of national unity to resume their intrigues and combinations for the pursuit of their old aims under new forms. All serious anti-fascists and supporters of decisive victory over Hitler need to recognise that the inadequacies of the existing united national front, and the legitimate criticisms which can be brought against its present working, demonstrate the necessity to strengthen it, and to strengthen the Government as the representative of the democratic anti-fascist will to victory of the people, and not to weaken it. The disruption of national unity only serves the interests of Hitler.
</p>
<p>
The transition, which is thus now imperative and urgent, from the present largely formal united national front, which in respect of organisation mainly exists on top, to the real living unity of the entire nation, drawing in the active democratic participation of the masses of men and women and of the mass organisations of the people, depends above all on the r&ocirc;le of the working class movement. Only a strong, active and united working class, rallying and drawing into activity other sections of the people, can constitute the core of national unity. Without this, national unity is distorted and crippled. This is the key to the problems of the present political situation in Britain.
</p>
<p>
The working class has no interests opposed to the interests of the united national front for victory over Hitler. The working class acts and fights as an integral part of the united national front. The strengthening of national unity is the vital concern of the working class, which has the most direct interest, for its very existence and the future of its aims, to secure the complete defeat of Fascism.
</p>
<p>
Within the broad unity of the national front for the defeat of Hitler, the organised workers, representing the most active and politically conscious sections of the democratic forces of the nation, have a distinctive r&ocirc;le to play and a foremost responsibility to fulfil.
</p>
<p>
The working class constitutes the majority of the nationand not merely the arithmetical majority, but that section which bears the decisive burden of the war effort alike in the field of production and in the fighting services. The r&ocirc;le of the working class is decisive for the success of the war effort.
</p>
<p>
The working class is the rising class, which represents the future and which is least tied by the trammels of the past. The inevitable conflict between private property interests or monopolist restrictive policies and the maximum war effort means that the propertied sections of the nation, with the exception of a few individuals, are hampered from giving full and unqualified support to the maximum war effort by considerations for vested interests or fears of weakening the structure of property rights. The workers are not shackled by these limitations; they are by comparison free and unprejudiced in approach; they are ready to welcome what is new and progressive; they are less held back by fears of encroachment on vested interests; there is a wealth of creative energy in the working class which is still barely tapped in this country. It is not for nothing that that country where the working class has assumed power and the leadership of society has astonished the world by its limitless creative energy and resourcefulness, abundance of young and talented leading forces in every sphere, economic, political or military, its unshakable national unity, heroism, mass enthusiasm, capacity for self-sacrifice and dynamic achievement.
</p>
<p>
The working class is the most determined and inflexible anti-fascist section of the nation. Within the propertied classes there is division and conflict of interests and outlook in relation to Fascism, because powerful sections see in Fascism the protection of their interests against the working class and socialism, and fear that a too decisive victory over Fascism would open the gates to the future victory of socialism. These calculations and fears among the propertied sections in all countries, which have been cunningly played on by Nazi propaganda, provide the basis of Munichism, the Quislings and the Fifth Column. The Fifth Column, as the War Cabinet Minister, Mr. Bevin, truly pointed out in July, 1940, has never come from the working class, but always &#8220;from higher up.&#8221; Thus considerable sections of the propertied classes enter on the war against Fascism with a divided allegiance.
</p>
<p>
For the workers, on the other hand, the battle against Fascism is absolute and without compromise. Fascism, the representative of the most reactionary forces of the old dying social order, sets itself the aim to destroy the working class movement; to destroy the Socialist State in which the working people have already been able to win power and build that new social order which represents the aim of the working class movement in all countries; to destroy the democratic forms and national independence of all countries within the framework of which the working class movement has been able to grow up and build its organisation; and to destroy all aspirations to human progress and betterment. Between Fascism and the working class movement the battle is mortal, through whatever forms it must pass; one or the other must perish. The defeat of Fascism is the condition of survival of the working class movement and of the advance to Socialism. In this battle is being determined the fate of the working class movement and the future of the world.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the working class is the principal organised section of the nation and of democracy. The six million trade unionists, representing with their families the majority of the population; the two million members of the Labour Party; the nine million co-operators; the countless activity of the organised workers in the factories through their shop stewards and shop and works committees, and to-day also through the joint production committees; the Communist Party with an active membership and range of propaganda and campaigning exceeding that of any other political party or organisation: all these represent the forces of the organised working class. The workers are trained in discipline, solidarity, democratic initiative and organisation, self-sacrifice and tenacious struggle. They have learned the lessons of unity and collective action in place of individualism and egoism. Through generations of struggle against heavy odds they have built up their organisation, won their rights, and fought in the forefront of every battle for democratic freedom, national liberty and human progress. Thus the organised workers have won and earned the r&ocirc;le of the vanguard of the people, able and with the right, to the extent that they have achieved their own unity and leadership, to rally and draw with them in common action the masses of the people.
</p>
<p>
The tasks which the working class movement needs to fulfil within the common national front for the defeat of Hitler correspond to the character of the conflict and represent the highest level of responsibility in the long record of struggle of the working class.
</p>
<p>
First, the organised working class should be the strongest champion, organiser and defender of national unity for the defeat of Hitler. Against all hesitations and vacillations in other classes and sections of the nation; against all intrigues of adventurist and pro-fascist elements for the disruption of national unity; against all moods of passivity, half-heartedness, defeatism, war weariness, flinching from action and sacrifice, or leftist impatience, either in its own ranks or in the unorganised masses of the people, the strength, unity and leadership of the organised working class should be the most powerful bulwark and rallying-centre to lead, unite, inspire, hold firm and draw into active participation all sections of the people.
</p>
<p>
The workers know from twenty years of experience the necessity of unity against Fascism. Fascism has previously advanced, not by its superior strength, but by the division of its opponents. The unity of all opponents of Fascism is essential for victory. This lesson has been driven home equally by the experience of Germany, Austria or Italy, where the division of the working class and democratic forces permitted the victory of Fascism; and by the experience of France and Spain, where the unity of the working class and of the People&#8217;s Front stemmed the advance of Fascism, until inner weakening or international disunity again broke the front; no less than by the example of China, where the national united front has for five years been able to hold at bay the armed power of Japan and prepare the conditions for future victory. The establishment of world unity against Hitler, on the basis of the world alliance and of the unity of each nation engaged in the common fight against the fascist enemy, has already brought within view the doom of the Nazi regime and of the Axis aims of world fascist domination. Only the disruption of this unity, division in action or hesitation to bring into play the decisive combined strength of united action, could delay this doom. Therefore the maintenance and strengthening of this unity, both of the world alliance and of each nation fighting in the common cause, and unshakable opposition to every attempt to disrupt this unity or weaken united action, is the dearest interest of the working class in this historical moment. In this life-and-death struggle the working class can afford to lose no allies, however partial, hesitant or vacillating. The working class stands out and must stand out as the most determined upholder of national and international unity for the military defeat of German Fascism.
</p>
<p>
Second, the working class should not only be the most active upholder of the united national front for the defeat of Hitler, but should also be the most active driving force within the united national front. The working class has its positive contribution to make in the sphere of policy, programme and leadership. In every field of the struggle, in strategy, in political mobilisation in way production, in social and economic organisation, in colonial policy, in diplomatic policy, in propaganda, in the questions of war aims, the most active struggle needs to be conducted for the measures which are necessary in the interests of the world alliance for speediest victory over Fascism. The working class movement has the power and the responsibility to take the initiative in the fight to win support for these measures within the united national front and for their adoption by the Government.
</p>
<p>
Concretely, in the present situation this means that the organised working class movement should take the lead in the fight for a combined inter-allied strategy for maximum common action and full utilisation of existing forces in order to achieve the aim of victory in 1942, that is, specifically for the Second Front on the Continent of Europe; for the strengthening of the Government by the elimination of the remaining Munichite Ministers and the drawing in of the most resolute, energetic and capable democratic anti-fascist representatives; for the intensification and speeding up of war production by unified planning and effective public control of all war industry under a strong Ministry of Production, and ruthless over-riding of all sectional and vested interests which hamper maximum production; for the enforcement of a closer approach to equality of sacrifice in social and economic policy; for the protection and extension of democratic rights and press freedom for the purposes of antifascist mobilisation of the people, while operating more stringent measures against fascist and pro-fascist elements and propaganda; for winning the co-operation of the Indian people by the recognition of the independence of India and the establishment of a representative Indian National Government capable of mobilising and organising the defence of the Indian people as an equal partner in the alliance of the United Nations; for the strengthening of political and diplomatic collaboration with the Soviet Union, both in the conditions of the war and in the settlement following the war; for the strengthening of democratic anti-fascist collaboration with the peoples of Europe enslaved by Nazi rule, and the repudiation of all aims and policies which hinder such collaboration; and for all similar measures which strengthen the anti-fascist alliance, protect its democratic anti-fascist aims and speed victory.
</p>
<p>
All these are measures which are urgently necessary for victory over Hitler, but in relation to which there is still hesitation, indifference or resistance within the united national front. It is essential to develop an informed public opinion in support of these measures within the united national front, to organise mass pressure in order to overcome reactionary resistance and strengthen the hands of the Government for carrying them out, and to secure their adoption by the Government as the representative of national unity. The working class movement has here a decisive r&ocirc;le to play in voicing, leading and organising the fight for such measures.
</p>
<p>
Third, the organised working class movement has a special responsibility, in relation to the requirements of the war effort, to protect the standards, conditions and rights of the workers and of the masses of the people. In the interests of the major immediate aim of victory over Hitler, the workers have had to make many concessions, which under other conditions would have been stubbornly contested. It is the concern of the organised working class movement to see that these concessions are not exploited in the sectional interests of monopoly capital; that the compulsory powers, which have been freely used against the workers, are equally used, wherever the needs of the war dictate, against big capital, and that, within the limitations of war conditions, the standards and health of the working people take precedence as the first charge on all available means of consumption, in place of the present excess consumption expenditure of the upper incomes and propertied sections. For this purpose the working class movement needs to take special concern for the improvement of the pay, conditions and allowances of those serving in the armed forces and their dependants; the levelling up of old age pensions, widows&#8217; pensions and other social service benefits; the improvement of women workers&#8217; wages and conditions with the aim to realise effective equality of pay, and the raising of the wages of low paid sections; the revision of taxation to take all excess incomes above a certain level, and raise the exemption limit for lower incomes; the extension of rationing and price control; the protection of the rights of the workers in the factories; the protection of working class and democratic rights of propaganda and organisation, etc. Similarly in the necessary changes in industry the working class organisations can alone judge the best ways and methods to combine the two objectives of maximum production with the safeguarding of the rights and interests and future claims of the workers. All these questions, while the initiative and guidance in solving them must come especially from the working class movement, are no separate interest of a section, but the vital interest of the united war effort, for the purposes of democratic anti-fascist war and for the protection of the future.
</p>
<p>
Fourth, the strength, unity and active leading r&ocirc;le of the working class movement is the best guarantee, not only for the realisation of the present maximum war effort and united strategy for victory, but also for the future, for the character of the settlement which will follow the war, for the character of the organisation of the world after the war, and for the democratic and social advance which must follow victory over Fascism. The working class movement, as the representative of the working people and of the true interests of the nation, has the responsibility to see that the efforts and sacrifices of the people shall not be exploited for reactionary aims, throwing down a Hitler in order to set up some alternative form of reaction; that the settlement which follows the war shall correspond to the democratic anti-fascist aims of the people for the realisation of the freedom of nations and the organisation of a durable peace; that friendship and collaboration with the Soviet Union and with all the progressive forces of the world shall be maintained and carried forward; and that the economic and political concessions of the workers during the war, the concentration of monopoly capital and of executive powers necessitated by the requirements of the war, shall not become the basis of the intensified subjection and exploitation of the workers and enthronement of reaction after the war, but that, on the contrary, the advance shall be carried rapidly forward towards the aims of the working class movement, the aims of social liberation. No paper plan and no paper document can guarantee this. The hatching of elaborate plans of post-war reconstruction at the present moment, before the premisses are present, can easily take on a reactionary hue, or become a diversion from present urgent tasks. Only the real relations of social and political forces at the conclusion of the war will determine the outcome. Only a powerful and united working class movement can ensure that the outcome shall correspond to the interests of the working people. But this depends on the present strengthening, achievement of unity and fulfilment of its present political r&ocirc;le of the working class movement. The present determines the future.
</p>
<p>
In order to fulfil these tasks, the working class movement needs to be strong and united, and with a policy and leadership capable of responding to present needs. The workers need to build up their organisation, trade union, political and cooperative; to achieve unity and overcome sectional barriers and divisions; to pursue actively a policy and programme corresponding to the urgent needs of the war; and to develop effective political leadership. The picture of the outstanding r&ocirc;le which the working class movement can and should fulfil in the present situation is still far from the picture of what has so far been achieved. Within the framework of national unity there is not yet working class unity. This is a grave and dangerous contradiction which undermines national unity and shifts the balance in favour of reactionary forces. All the difficulties of the present political situation arise from the fact that there is not yet a strong and united working class movement fulfilling that active and leading r&ocirc;le within the united national front which it can and should fulfil. Hence the manifold &#8220;independent&#8221; groupings are enabled to press their competing claims for the support of the people, and to confuse and weaken the popular forces for the ultimate benefit of reaction.
</p>
<p>
The experience of the critical years leading up to the present war already demonstrated the truth of this. Why was it possible for the policies of &#8220;non-intervention&#8221; in Spain, of Munich, of conciliation to Hitler, of refusal of the British-Soviet Pact and sabotage of collective security to be carried through by the Chamberlain Government, in spite of the overwhelming strength of popular opinion against them (87 per cent. poll for the British-Soviet Pact, eleven millions vote for the Peace Ballot for collective security, etc.) and the actual division of the ruling class, sown in the division of the Conservative Party? Only because the organised working, class movement failed to fulfil its task of rallying and uniting the working class and democratic forces in a common front or People&#8217;s Front, which would have been capable&#8212;as opponents of the policy at the time recognized&#8212;of defeating Chamberlain and compelling a change of course. It is now widely recognised that if this policy, which was advocated at the time by the Communist Party, had been followed, we should be in a different situation to-day, and we should have probably been able to avoid the present war or, had it come, to have met it from the outset in a far more favourable situation.
</p>
<p>
To-day the representatives of the organised working class movement are participating in the Coalition Government for the defeat of Hitler. But this participation of individuals in a War Ministry, with little evidence of important influence on the major questions of policy, is far from equivalent to the active participation of a strong and united working class movement in the common national front, presenting its proposals and programme for the common cause, mobilising public opinion, and able in this way, both directly and through its representatives (whose voice would become strong as the voice of a mighty united movement with popular support), to exercise its due and powerful impress on the combined policy finally adopted by the Government. The weakness of the present situation, which is acutely felt by Labour supporters throughout the country, is not so much a question of the character of the individual representatives participating in the Coalition Ministry, as of the fact that this personal participation is regarded as a substitute for the participation of the working class movement in the national front, and is even made the occasion for closing down the political activity of the working class movement with consequent tendencies to decline of membership and stagnation of organisation, in this moment of most intense crisis, fateful issues and highest responsibility for the whole future of the movement.
</p>
<p>
In consequence, the criticism is sometimes expressed by some Labour supporters that the mistake lies in the participation in the Coalition Government, and that the solution is for Labour to come out of the Coalition. This, in the present situation, when Labour is in a minority in parliament, and there could be no question of Labour alone representing national unity, is equivalent to the denial of the necessity for national unity for the defeat of Hitler. Such a policy would play straight into the hands of reaction and the pro-Hitler forces. The maintenance of national unity, and of a Government representative of all political sections which stand for victory over Hitler, is essential for victory over Hitler and is therefore the vital interest of the working class movement. The fault does not lie in the participation in the Coalition, which is indispensable in the present relations of political forces, but in the policy pursued. The remedy does not lie in the disruption of national unity, and of the Coalition Government founded on its basis, but in the strengthening of the active r&ocirc;le and positive leadership of the working class movement in the national front.
</p>
<p>
Similarly the criticism is sometimes heard that the labour movement is &#8220;dead,&#8221; that there is stagnation, apathy and passivity in the localities, that organisation has fallen to pieces, and that the masses are turning elsewhere; and the conclusion is drawn that the future must be sought in some new &#8220;independent&#8221; &#8220;non-party&#8221; grouping or formation without roots in the organised workers or their mass organisations. This gloomy picture of the present situation of the organised working class movement is not a true picture. It is one-sided because it sees only what is going down and not what is rising; it sees a process of change and transition, which is the stirring of new life, as a process of decay and death. It is not the labour movement that is going down, but only old policies and methods which are discredited; new forces are rising to carry forward the movement and respond to present needs. Our task must be to assist this advance, and to clear away the obstacles which still stand in the path of further advance.
</p>
<p>
The workers are not quiescent. There is in fact abounding life and activity of the organised working class movement, even though still partial, and even though still held in by many limitations. The rise of trade union membership to over six millions represents the highest level for twenty years. Organisation and activity in the factories is more strongly developed than it has ever been, and is full of vitality, with plentiful evidence of keen enthusiasm and mass participation. Sales of working class literature have multiplied many times over during the war, and there is a new and serious reading public among the workers. The Communist Party has more than trebled its membership since the outbreak of war, and snore than doubled it in the most recent period, reaching a total of fifty thousand active individual members, a new type of development in socialist organisation in this country. On the basis of its policy expressing the plain common interests of the workers and of the entire nation in the present struggle, it has been able to organise campaigns, meetings and demonstrations, with the participation of representatives of all sections of the working class and democratic movement, which have won striking mass support exceeding previous levels of political campaigning and in certain cases exercising a perceptible influence in the political situation (campaigns for the removal of Margesson and Moore-Brabazon, for the Second Front, etc.).<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">*</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There is therefore no ground for deducing a decline in political interest of the organised workers from the recent decline in membership and local organisation of the Labour Party. This is only a reflection of the policies pursued during this period, the closing down of activities, and the harmful effects of the system of bans and exclusions. The removal of these causes could rapidly show a different picture.
</p>
<p>
The conclusion is evident. If the relatively small numbers of the most politically conscious workers organised in the Communist Party and the united movement have been already able to achieve a degree of mass response untouched by any other political party or organisation, how much more could be achieved if the entire organised working class movement were brought behind these demands and mobilised in united activity on a common immediate programme?
</p>
<p>
What is needed?	The first necessity is to establish effective working class unity in action. The still continuing opposition of the Labour Party leadership to cooperation of the different sections of the working class movement in the present urgent common fight, and the imposition of the system of bans and exclusions within the political labour movement, with extension to the trade union sphere in respect of trades councils and in some unions, is less than ever defensible in the present situation. Despite the progressive step forward of the establishment of the British-Soviet Trade Union Committee, the policy of hostility to working class unity within Britain has even been intensified in certain respects since the establishment of British-Soviet unity. An extreme example of this policy has been shown in the attempted banning even of British-Soviet Unity Committees, broadly based on the cooperation of all parties and organisations, political and non-poitical, under the leadership of the civic authorities, for the promotion of friendship and collaboration between Britain and the Soviet Union&#8212;on the grounds that cooperation between Labour Party members and Communists on a common committee and a common platform must not be permitted, even for the common aim of the fight against Hitler. This policy is neither in the interests of national unity for the defeat of Hitler, nor is it in the interests of the working class movement. Fortunately, the bans have not always been successful, and cooperation is extending in practice, in accordance with the healthy sense of the overwhelming majority of the working class movement; but it is still heavily impeded by the present disciplinary measures and the absence of cooperation on a national scale.
</p>
<p>
The aim of the policy of refusal of unity and disciplinary division of the working class movement is directed to place an artificial barrier between the vanguard of the working class and the main body, and thus seeks to prevent that interaction. which is indispensable for the health and growth of the movement as a whole. The Communist Party has established its permanent place in the life of the working class movement as the representative of a growing body of politically conscious workers, and can make its distinctive contribution and fulfil an increasingly valuable r&ocirc;le in the development of the working class movement as a whole. To attempt to prevent this by disciplinary regulations and threats is to attempt to stem the advancing tide of the working class movement. The refusal of unity and the system of division of the working class movement enabled Hitler to come to power in Germany. The same system serves the interests of Hitler in Britain to-day. It is necessary to make a serious attempt to overcome the present difficulties and find the way to establish united action and the free functioning of a united working class movement, by the cooperation of the Labour Party and the Communist Party, and the removal of those disciplinary bans on cooperation which paralyse the local working class movement or prevent the democratic election of representatives and expression of opinion within the working class movement. The establishment of such working class unity in action would enormously stimulate the growth, self-confidence, enthusiasm and revived activity of the entire working class movement.
</p>
<p>
Second, such working class unity in action needs to be based on a common immediate programme. It is necessary to adopt a common programme of action of the united working class movement corresponding to the present needs for the achievement of victory in 1942, and to be campaigned for within the framework of the united national front. The question of working class unity is not merely a question of organisation; it is a question of policy. At present there is dangerous disunity in practice, and the authority and responsibility of the working class movement is thereby weakened.	Despite the formal participation in the coalition, there is lack of convinced understanding of the necessity of national unity within the. local sections, as recent by-elections have shown. Adventurist elements from outside the working class movement are able to take advantage of this confusion to win support for their careerist aims or for groupings hostile to the interests of national unity against Hitler. Trends alien to the working class movement, whether chauvinist or pacifist, are able to take advantage of the passivity to penetrate and win support. When some representative leaders associate with the agitation of a Vansittart; when others are associated with pacifist groupings which are in fact pro-fascist in their policy; when Labour electors withhold support from candidates representing national unity and their leaders hesitate even to appear on a platform in a by-election to recommend national unity; then it is obvious that such demoralisation is weakening to the working class movement and prevents it from fulfilling the r&ocirc;le which it should fulfil in the national front. The adoption of a common immediate programme and campaign of a united working class movement, expressing the urgent necessary measures for speediest victory over Hitler, would rally all sections of the workers in support, end the weaknesses and vacillations, and lead to the very great strengthening of the working class movement and its political r&ocirc;le.
</p>
<p>
Third, the campaign of the united working class movement needs to be developed with the active cooperation of all sections on the basis of the common programme. For this purpose the extension of working class activity, and the protection, restoration or extension of the necessary democratic rights for anti-fascist propaganda and agitation is essential. In the forefront stands the question of the restoration of the <em>Daily Worker</em>. It is now admitted by the widest sections of opinion that the maintenance of the ban on the <em>Daily Worker</em> is indefensible. This question is vital for the strengthening of the working class movement, no less than for the cause of press freedom, democratic rights and national unity in the fight against Hitler. The opinion of leading trade unions and democratic organisations has emphatically called for the lifting of the ban. The <em>Daily Worker</em> since its foundation in 1930 has stood in the forefront of the fight for the unity of the working people, for opposition to Fascism, and for cooperation with the Soviet Union. To-day it could fulfil a r&ocirc;le which would mobilise, inspire and organise mass opinion and activity throughout the country for the united national fight against Hitler, for intensified war production, for the strengthening of the working class movement and for speedy victory. The attitude towards the ban on the <em>Daily Worker</em> is becoming more and more a touchstone of the whole attitude towards the war and the democratic anti-fascist aims of the war. It is imperative in the interests of the working class movement, no less than of the anti-fascist fight and of the cause of victory over Hitler that the <em>Daily Worker</em> should be immediately restored in order to fulfil the great r&ocirc;le which it can play in the cause of the working class and of democracy.
</p>
<p>
Such a revival of working class activity, on the basis of the establishment of working class unity and a united campaign would not merely strengthen the working class movement and the fulfilment of its r&ocirc;le in the national front, but would greatly strengthen the entire national war effort and the will to victory. The strength and the unity of the working class rallies wide sections around it. The common programme of the united working class, expressing the present needs of the struggle against Hitler, and embodying the necessary measures for victory, would win an enormous response from the entire nation. The establishment of working class unity on the basis of such a common immediate programme would basically change the political situation in Britain and open up a new perspective in the war. This path would lead to the most rapid achievement of a combined strategy, the opening up of the Second Front in Europe, and the accomplishment of those accompanying necessary measures which would help to make possible the realisation of the aim of victory in 1942.
</p>
<p>
More than this. A strong and united working class movement in this country would thus help to create the most favourable conditions for the speedy victorious ending of the war against Hitler. At the same time it would represent the most effective force on the side of the people for tackling the problems which would follow such a victory.
</p>
<p>
Great problems and great tasks tie before us. We need to defeat Fascism. We need to ensure that the world we shall create after the defeat of Fascism shall not permit the continued domination of those reactionary forces which have produced Fascism and the present evils, but shall correspond to the aspirations of the people for freedom, for a durable peace and for better conditions of life. We can achieve these aims, provided that we fulfil our present tasks and build up our strength and unity of the working class and popular forces in the battles of to-day to be capable of controlling the issues of the future. The greatest responsibility here rests with the working class.
</p>
<p>
In proportion as we fulfil our present tasks, and build up the strength of the working class movement in so doing, we shall be strong also to face the future.

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p class="fst"><a href="#1b" name="1">*</a>&#160;The Trafalgar Square demonstration for the Second Front in March, 1942, organised by the Communist Party, exceeded any previous level of demonstrations in Trafalgar Square, according to the testimony of the veteran, Ben Tillett, ranging over the memories of sixty years since the great demonstrations of the eighties in the early days of the modern political working class movement. Thirty five thousand participated in this demonstration; in the succeeding Trafalgar Square demonstration of the Communist Party in May, 1942, accompanying the Communist Party National Conference, fifty thousand participated, and unanimously voted a resolution supporting the Communist programme for the Second Front and other measures directed to the aim of victory in 1942.</p>
