<h3>The Army and the People</h3>

<p class="fst">
IN a progressive democratic war there can be no barrier of division between the army and the people. Millions of citizens, the cream of the nation&#8217;s man-power, are undertaking the most responsible, exacting and (under the conditions of modern mechanised warfare) highly skilled task of the common fight against Fascism. In the final resort, as in the case of invasion, the obligation of the military fight against Fascism falls on all able-bodied citizens, on all save the very young, aged or sick. The full-time armed services, whether land, sea or air forces, are the spearhead, the picked, most capable, trained representatives of the entire united nation for bearing and using the arms produced by the rest of the nation for the defeat of the fascist enemy. The interests of the armed services must be the first concern of the civilian population. The care of their families is the responsibility of the nation. The equipment, training, discipline and morale of the armed forces is the measure of the capacity of the nation to defeat Fascism. The army and the people are one.
</p>
<p>
These elementary governing principles of the role of the army, and of the relations of army and people, in a progressive democratic war mean a great change from previous traditional conceptions with regard to the army, the status of the army in the State or the inner life and organisation of the army. The requirements of modern warfare, and especially of modern antifascist war, with its union of military and political tasks, its combination of military strategy with political insurrectionary movements of enslaved peoples, and the special tactical and strategic characteristics of modern mechanised war, with the much higher degree of individual initiative, mechanical training and tactical skill demanded of every soldier, reinforce this necessity of a complete change from traditional conceptions in relation to the army.

Formerly the British Army was a small professional long-service army. Its main function was that of a garrison and police force in the colonial Empire, with availability, in case of civil disorder, against the people at home. Its main training was for colonial wars; it was a limited auxiliary of the principal weapon of British power, the Navy. Its composition corresponded to this task and function. The officers were drawn from a narrow upper-class section of the nation. The men were recruited mainly by the whip of starvation from the worst-off social stratum of the nation, from long unemployed workers, slum proletarians or those without training or prospect in civilian life (in 1925, out of 89,277 volunteering, no less than 52,200 or 58 per cent. were rejected on physical and medical grounds). The discipline and organisation corresponded to this composition and task. The discipline was a severe barrack-square discipline, making the heaviest calls on blind obedience and the least on intelligence, and assuming, in the whole character of training and of the traditional ethical code and penal regulations, the lowest level of intelligence and moral character of the private soldier (&#8220;Drunkenness and absence without leave are the two offences which require to be most frequently dealt with by the commanding officer,&#8221; &#8220;Manual of Military Law,&#8221; 1929). The Army was, in the fullest sense a class army: &#8220;the Army to-day is still fundamentally the same as that which existed throughout the nineteenth century; it is organised on a class basis&#8221; (Rt. Hon. C. R. Attlee in February, 1938). The Army was cut off from the nation&#8212;&#8220;monastic in character, an Army from the nation and walled up within an archaic discipline; in a way, an aristocratic caste founded upon ancient traditions&#8221; (Major-General J. F. C. Fuller, &#8220;The Army in My Time,&#8221; 1935, p. 17).
</p>
<p>
To-day the Army is in actual composition a Citizen Army, composed of millions of citizens drawn from all sections of the nation, a cross-section of the people, linked with the civilian population through nearly every family and household, and representing to a considerable degree the most intelligent, capable, trained and politically alert sections of the nation, the best of the younger generation. Yet the framework, the organisation, training, code and system of leadership, into which these millions of citizens are required to fit themselves, is still in the main essentials the framework of the old professional army, devised to meet different conditions, and leading to much unnecessary friction, frustration, misuse of skill and wasted effort. Some changes have already been made to meet the new conditions, to modernise the training, to broaden the area of selection of officers, to make more rational and human the discipline, and to recognise and encourage the cultural and political interests and consciousness of the citizen-soldiers. But these changes have still to advance through heavily entrenched obstruction of old routine and prejudice; and very much more far-reaching changes are still necessary.
</p>
<p> 
The army of the people for the war against Fascism (using the term, the army, in the most general sense for all the armed forces, not only the land army, but equally the navy, the air force, or the commandos, together with the artillery, tank corps, engineers, signals, anti-aircraft corps, etc.) needs to be well-equipped with all modern weapons of war, well-clothed, well-fed, well-trained and well-led. But this is only the beginning of the responsibilities of the nation in relation to the army. In this war against fascist barbarism the equipment of the antifascist soldier needs to be not only tanks, planes and munitions; not only a training, discipline, organisation and use of his skill corresponding with the requirements of modern mechanised warfare. The equipment of the anti-fascist soldier needs to be also a moral and political equipment&#8212;all that is embodied in the term &#8220;morale.&#8221;
</p>
<p> 
The anti-fascist soldier must know and hate the enemy, Fascism, and know well and love the cause for which he fights; he must feel himself the representative of the nation, whose fate and honour is entrusted in his hands; he must be filled with a burning resolution to achieve all and endure all on behalf of his own people and for the victory of the anti-fascist cause, the cause of all the peoples of the world. Political education and technical military education are equally necessary for the modern democratic soldier. In place of the old slogan, &#8220;no politics in the army&#8221;, the modern army of the people is and must be a political army, that is, an army of conscious fighters understanding for what they are fighting, an army of citizen soldiers. This necessity has been recognised in principle by the army authorities, with the institution of political lectures, the Army Bureau of Current Affairs, etc. The War Office instruction lays down:
</p>
<p class="quote">
&#8220;The soldier who understands the cause for which he fights is likely to be a more reliable soldier than one who does not. Many soldiers have no such understanding, and many others are losing touch with the sources of knowledge and information they used to possess.
</p>
<p class="quote">
It is the business of the Army to make good this deficiency of knowledge, and therefore to devise what means are possible to keep the men abreast of current affairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p> 
The first steps which have been taken in this direction still suffer from many weaknesses, and have been carried out in very varying degree, and with very varying standards, in different units. There are still needless restrictions on the political freedom of soldiers as citizens. Higher officers are able to make their views felt through parliament and other channels; serving soldiers are hemmed in by restrictions and regulations. Greater freedom of political expression, and greater freedom of contact and association of soldiers with the civilian population in political life, is the indispensable basis to ensure that the political life and consciousness of the army shall not develop in isolation, but as part of the political life and consciousness of the united nation.
</p>
<p> 
The most important source of strength for the soldier is the sense that he is not isolated, but closely linked with the people and their aims. He must feel that the people are united behind him, that the front and the rear are one, with common interests and outlook; that, while he performs his duty in military training and in the fighting front, the civilian population, his brothers and sisters, father and mother, are working and striving unitedly to provide him with equipment, to look after his family, and to take over and share all his responsibilities. Niggardly treatment of the soldiers&#8217; dependants, lowering their level below the level of families whose breadwinner has not been called up, means not only injustice to millions who are left without protection and whose well-being is the responsibility of the nation; it means weakening the army and the morale of the army. The concessions which have so far been made are extremely inadequate. The soldier&#8217;s wife with two children, even if her husband allots her the whole of the 3s. 6d. he receives under the latest increase, is still left with only 36s. 6d., while the single girl emerging from an engineering training centre receives 43s. per week, already a low wage. The demand of the labour movement for a flat rate of £2 for the soldier&#8217;s wife and 10s. for each child is modest enough; and such a minimum should be immediately established.
</p>
<p> 
The disruptive propaganda which seeks to promote ill-will by making comparisons between soldiers&#8217; pay and industrial workers&#8217; wages (while ignoring the really extravagant incomes of company directors or parasitic rentiers) needs to be actively combatted. The soldiers, sprung from the working class, need to understand that the industrial workers, in protecting their standards and conditions, are protecting the common interests of the whole working class, including the soldiers when they return to industry. At the same time, the industrial workers need to take up actively the fight for the improvement of soldiers&#8217; pay and dependants&#8217; allowances. Here, as elsewhere in the conditions of existing class society, there can be no abstract justice; but there can be and must be solidarity on the basis of a clear and conscious understanding of the common interests of the working people, whether serving in the army or in industry. Neglect by the labour movement of the interests and daily problems of those in the armed services, or lack of living contact, leads to the danger of alienation and opens the way to harmful influences. The closest understanding between the armed forces and the people is equally essential for the morale of the army and for the most effective production in industry. Everything which promotes closer contact and co-operation; including between particular organisations of the workers and particular units of the army, is in the national interest and strengthens the front against Fascism.
</p>
<p>
No less important are the necessary steps to strengthen the methods of training, organisation, promotion, leadership and discipline within the army in order to meet the drastic requirements of modern war, utilise more fully the capacities available within the army, and overcome the weaknesses consequent on the still powerful class-system and traditions. It is claimed that the avenues of promotion for the selection of officers are now thrown very much more widely open on the basis of efficiency rather than of class; but the practical results so far show that the effectiveness of this is still limited (it was recently stated on behalf of the War Office in parliament as proof of the new situation that only 24 per cent. of commissioned officers now came from the public schools; but in relation to the proportion of the male population passing through the public schools, estimated at 0.1 per cent., this would still represent 240 times their quota). The Beveridge Committee Report in February, 1942, showed the still &#8220;continuing failure to use men of engineering skill according to their skill, which has surprised us by its extent.&#8221; While methods of drill and training have been widely modernised, reports would indicate that there is still considerable room for improvement. The compatibility of more democratic relations between officers and men, and of more democratic conditions in the life of the army when off duty, with the maintenance of fully efficient discipline, has been abundantly demonstrated in the armies of other countries; but necessary changes are still delayed. Even such a moderate conservative organ as the <em>Observer</em> (November 30, 1941) has recommended the formation of representative soldiers&#8217; committees, reporting to regular general meetings of the soldiers and dealing with all matters of welfare and common concern, with the exclusion of military operations and training: &#8220;a Unit Forum, meeting regularly to discuss the general welfare of the unit, would do more to democratise the army than anything else.&#8221; All such measures would help to promote the democratic spirit, morale and efficiency of the army.
</p>
<p>
The most important need, however, for the army, as for the whole nation, is the ending of the passive waiting strategy of defence, whose prolonged continuance in the midst of crucial conflicts inevitably leads to demoralisation. The overwhelming majority of the army to-day consists of men who have been under arms for over two years without being under fire. This enforced passivity, without taking part in either fighting or production, and being compelled to watch as spectators the titanic conflicts of the Soviet armies on the Eastern Front needing every man, is not good for the spirit of the army. Such passivity behind the Maginot line during the winter of 1939-40 weakened the morale of the French Army. The delay of the Second Front (against the overwhelming feeling of the men, as shown in many manifestations) has done harm. This passivity breeds cynicism, political indifference, slackness, the sense of inferiority and myths of Nazi invincibility. Further, it injures the relations of the army and the civilian population. The presence of a vast idle army of millions living on the country, and neither fighting nor producing, with reports of army waste, abundant rations, and corruption, weakens the stimulus to the maximum effort, sacrifice and production on the part of the civilian population, and leads to bad feeling and a cynical attitude, which becomes the counterpart of the agitation within the army against industrial workers&#8217; wages. All these are the evil fruits of the policy of passivity. They can only be finally ended, not by political education and propaganda alone, but by action. The hour of action will sweep these passing clouds away. The opening of the Second Front in Europe, the call to common effort and sacrifice of every fighter and every producer, with the fighting front calling to the workshop and the workshop calling to the front-this is the measure which more than any other will strengthen the morale of the army and the morale of the whole nation, and finite the army and the civilian population in close bonds of comradeship for common achievement and common victory.
