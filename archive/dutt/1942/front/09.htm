<h3>Britain in the World Front</h3>

<hr class="base" size="1">
<h4>Chapter IX</h4>
<h3>Women in the War Effort</h3>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<p class="fst">
THE enormous demands on man-power required for the present conflict, equally to maintain in the field the highest level of the fighting forces capable of carrying through an offensive strategy and to develop at the same time the necessary extended industrial and agricultural production, make it imperative that women play the fullest part in the war effort.
</p>
<p>
The struggle against fascist barbarism is the common cause of men and women. In fighting and working alongside the men in the present struggle, women are at the same time building their own future, both to defeat the deadly menace which Fascism represents to the cause of the freedom of women, and to hasten their advance, through their active present participation, towards the goal of full social freedom and equality.
</p>
<p> 
Women are the main reserve of the nation&#8217;s strength, of the total available man-power, both for industrial production and for agriculture, as well as for civil defence and for the auxiliary services to release additional forces for the fighting front. Herein lies the pivot of the possibility of extending Britain&#8217;s war effort. The Government has recognised this and called for the fullest participation of women. Nevertheless, through a variety of reasons and practical difficulties, this participation is still in fact limited.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Woman power is not being fully enough used. Human energy, talents and personality that would go far towards beating the Nazis are being wasted because men are doing jobs women could do. Soviet women take over the jobs of all men who should be at the front. It is the job of the trade unions to work with the women of the country and to let them know what they can do.&#8221;
</p>
<p> 
This observation of one of the Soviet women trade union leaders, Mrs. Malkova (reported in a press interview, January 16, 1942), who took part in the visit of the Soviet trade union delegation to the leading factories and industrial centres in Britain at the beginning of 1942, reflected one of the principal conclusions reached by the delegation. Again and again they called attention to the extent to which work was still being done by men which could be done by women. In the Soviet Union, despite the gigantic call-up of men to the armed forces, output in the factories and on the land has actually been increased, because the women have come forward to take the places of their husbands and brothers as factory workers, tractor drivers and land workers, dockers and railway workers, and in every sphere of production, as well as contributing to the armed forces. Here, where already in peacetime the proportion of women participating in production was much less and the reserves are consequently greater, we have not yet achieved anything like the same level of war mobilisation, although the needs, in view of the smaller population in this country and the manifold tasks we have to perform, are, to say the least of it, not less pressing.
</p>
<p class="quote">
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to decry the efforts and sacrifices of the women of Britain&#8212;in the days of the blitz they showed their calibre. Nevertheless, I should be doing less than my duty as a reporter of facts if I did not say that the sacrifices of the women of Russia are so stupendously greater than our own at home, not merely in extent but in depth, that sometimes they seem like a race apart.
</p>
<p class="quote">
&#8220;I am always reluctant to generalise about a people, and even more about a sex, but here, if ever, generalisations are safe. There are no shirkers, taking it by and large, no wealthy women with nothing to do, no prosperous escapists bemoaning the awful war from safe and comfortable ringside seats. If there had been, Russia would have lost the war by now&#8212;and Britain might well be knowing the indescribable horrors of a Nazi invasion on her own soil.&#8221; (Paul Winterton in the <em>News Chronicle</em>, April 10, 1942).
</p>
<p> 
The women of Britain are&#8212;with few exceptions&#8212;not lacking in willingness, nor in ability. The most serious effort needs to be made to conquer the obstacles which still impede their full participation.
</p>
<p> 
The urgency of this question is manifest as soon as we take into account the relatively restricted numbers of the population in this country (one-half the numbers of Nazi Germany, one-third those of the United States, and one-quarter those of the Soviet Union) in relation to the tasks we have to perform. Of the 46,750,000 people in this country, the numbers of working age, between fourteen and sixty-five years of age, are 33,250,000, of whom sixteen million are men and seventeen and a quarter million are women. The numbers actually engaged in earning work in 1931 were fourteen and three-quarter million men and six and a quarter million women, or twenty one millions in all. This means that if, say, five million men are withdrawn for the armed forces or civil defence, the available industrial productive forces are reduced by one quarter. In fact, however, the situation is more serious. For the number of men of military age, between the ages of twenty and forty-nine, is only ten millions. These represent the main active and skilled forces in industry; for the majority of the six million occupied women were not employed in industry, and even the minority employed in industry were mainly in light industry. The withdrawal of five million men of military age is therefore equivalent to the withdrawal of half the main forces in productive industry. Yet production needs at the same time to be enormously increased. The cutting out of non-essential industries and occupations can only partially meet this loss, still less meet the need for an increase. The only additional source of strength, to compensate for the transfer of half the main productive workers to the armed forces, and to make possible increased production, must arise from the drawing into production of large numbers of women who were not previously engaged in production. This is the heart of the question of man-power. In order to carry out the absolutely necessary maximum production of war materials and food, alongside the maintenance of the necessary level of the armed forces, every woman who is healthy and not prevented by the direct charge of children must be drawn into productive work (or, where necessary, civil defence or the auxiliary services).
</p>
<p> 
What is the present position? The six and a quarter million women already engaged in earning work before the war represented 34 per cent. of the total number of women in the working ages, as against 49 per cent. in Germany (Crowther, &#8220;Ways and Means of War,&#8221; 1940). Two-thirds of the women of working age were thus not engaged in production. In his statement on December 2, 1941, introducing the new proposals for organising woman-power, Mr. Churchill referred to &#8220;our largest reserve for industry and home defence in the future,&#8221; as represented by &#8220;this great field of married women or women doing necessary household work, comprising about eleven million persons.&#8221;
</p>
<p> 
Since the war, by March, 1942, it has been officially reported that one and a half million women have been drawn into &#8220;munitions and other vital industries&#8221; above the pre-war numbers already engaged in these industries (statement of the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Labour on March 5, 1942). But a considerable proportion of these have been drawn from other non-essential industries and services, so that they represent a transference from within the six and a quarter millions already occupied, and not an addition to the total number occupied or the bringing in of new forces. It must be borne in mind that of the six and a quarter millions occupied in peacetime the majority were engaged in personal service (two millions), commerce and distribution, as clerks or in the professions, and not in direct production; while those engaged in productive industry were mainly concentrated in textiles, clothing and light industries, which have been most heavily cut down. Thus this transference has provided a first reserve for war industry; but such transference does not yet change the proportion of only 34 per cent. of the total strength of woman-power being mobilised.
</p>
<p> 
How far have women not previously occupied been drawn in? When the total increase in war industry amounted to one million, in December, 1941, it was stated that one quarter of these were drawn from non-essential industries, and three-quarters from those previously not occupied, married or in domestic service. Thus three-quarters of a million not previously engaged in industry had been drawn into industry. But since domestic service constituted by far the largest group in the six and a quarter millions already occupied, it is not clear from this statement what numbers of actual new forces from the two thirds of women of working age not previously employed, had been drawn in. Allowing for such necessary deduction, it would appear probable from this report that by the end of 1941 an optimistic estimate would be about half a million, to which must be added the numbers recruited for civil defence and the auxiliary services, so far as these were not drawn from women already in employment. This is some indication how limited is the achievement so far.
</p>
<p> 
In the war of 1914-18 one and a quarter million additional women were brought into industry. It has been stated that &#8220;making allowance for the increase in population, we have already reached, at the twenty-seventh month of this war, the same employment of women in industry, the services and Forces as in the forty-eighth month of the last war&#8221; (Mr. Churchill on December 2, 1941). This would mean that only the level of mobilisation of the last war had been reached by the end of 1941. But the requirements now are enormously greater, as should also be the possibilities, with the development of the role of women during the intervening twenty years. The economist, H. Makower, estimated in the <em>Economic Journal</em> of January, 1940, that the aim should be set for an inflow of four million women into industry.
</p>
<p> 
This large-scale mobilisation of women for production is not an easy task. We have here to pay the penalty for past policy and prejudices in relation to women and their role in production and society. The powerful traditional obstacles, which still impede present mobilisation, include:
</p>
<p class="indent">
(1) the very limited and slow advance of the entry of women into industry up to the war.
</p>
<p class="indent">
(2) wage discrimination against women workers; systematic low wages paid to women workers (average earnings of women workers in 1935 were 31s. 3d., against 64s. 6d. for men, or less than half the men&#8217;s level; this discrepancy has increased since the war; in July, 1941, average earnings of women workers were 44s. 4d., against 99s. 3d. for men, or 44.7 per cent. as against 48.4 per cent. in 1935); so that only the pressure of dire economic need has hitherto driven women into industry.
</p>
<p class="indent">
(3) barring of skilled work to women, and lack of training. 
</p>
<p class="indent">
(4) barring of married women from many occupations, in some cases by direct regulations in other cases by discrimination in practice (except in the textile industries).
</p>
<p class="indent">
(5) fear of competition of women&#8217;s labour, leading to opposition of the skilled trade unions to the introduction of women into industry or to their training.
</p>
<p class="indent">
(6) low level of trade union organisation of women (one million out of six million employed, or one-sixth as against five millions out of fifteen millions for men, or one-third); neglect of the trade union movement to fight actively for the interests of women workers or to end the wage discrepancies and discrimination.
</p>
<p class="indent">
(7) lack of the necessary social provision, creches, communal feeding arrangements, etc., to facilitate the entry of married women into industry.
</p>
<p class="indent">
(8) the traditional conception of woman&#8217;s place as the home. Further, the economic and social development of the modern period has produced a mass of passive, inactive women of the &#8220;new middle class,&#8221; the wives and daughters of the suburban petty bourgeoisie, accustomed to frittering away their lives in a trivial round (often with even the limited degree of housework mainly covered by domestic labour), to whom the conception of entering into productive industry would appear as a lowering of their status. Previously inactive or apathetic in relation to the life of society or communal activity, so far as they have to-day recognised the necessity of participation in the war effort, they tend to regard this as covered by some voluntary part-time activity in a canteen or similar welfare effort, rather than to take part in productive labour. The National Service officers have also tended to regard such participation as adequate in these cases, so that the burden of administrative compulsion to enter war industry has mainly fallen on working class women in practice, already the most heavily burdened with home obligations and difficult conditions of life.
</p>
<p> 
The same economic and social development has brought to an extreme point the parasitism of the rich, upper class women, without social responsibility (often without even the degree of social and political interest of the previous generation of upper class women who were active in winning their emancipation in the early twentieth century) and living under conditions making for social degeneration.
</p>
<p> 
Finally, the political backwardness of the majority of women, inculcated by the whole preceding development and by the whole tone of existing society in relation to the role of women, hampers now the necessary speed of response to the struggle against the fascist menace and sense of responsible sharing in the democratic anti-fascist front.
</p>
<p> 
How has the Government endeavoured to meet this problem? The approach has been very gradual, cautious and compromising, with pressure mainly reserved for the working class women Even the idea of a limited measure of legal obligation for some sections of women was not adopted until the end of 1941, after two and a quarter years of war.
</p>
<p> 
During 1940 the principal method, apart from economic pressure, was still the method of general appeal and exhortation. Mr. Churchill appealed for a million women to enter industry.
</p>
<p> 
In the spring of 1941 national registration of women, to be carried out by successive age groups, was adopted. But administration was extremely dilatory. By March, 1942, five million women, covering the age-groups from 21 to 34 years, had registered. Of these, one and a half millions, or less than one in three had been interviewed. There was in practice no check on those who failed to register. The interviews, in the case of those not previously employed, were often very indefinite in character: all kinds of explanations of other obligations, or of performance of voluntary part-time duties, were in general easily accepted.
</p>
<p> 
The result was that, until the introduction of conscription for single young women at the end of 1941, the only compulsion which had in practice been used was economic compulsion for women wage-workers in the non-essential industries which were being closed down. In the cotton, lace, hosiery, boot and shoe, clothing, hat-making, pottery and other industries factories were closed down by government order, and the women previously employed in them were left to be absorbed in war industry, unemployment pay being suspended in cases where such jobs were refused. Thus working class women were driven by the threat of starvation into the shell-filling factories and similar work, while middle class women were left free.
</p>
<p> 
This class discrimination in the call-up for women has only been partially corrected by the introduction of conscription for single young women at the end of 1941, since in practice the middle class women, where not exempted on the grounds of voluntary duties, have been able to find their way into all kinds of services, in some cases of an exclusive or snobbish character, and soft jobs, and have hardly ever been compelled to enter industry, while it is the daughters of the working class who have been compelled to take on all the heavy, dangerous, unhealthy and disfiguring labour in the munitions factories. The independent women&#8217;s panels and appeals boards controlling the allocation are dominated by upper and middle class women. In this connection the letter of an enlightened manufacturer, a well-to-do-father, on the war work of his daughters is of interest:
</p>
<p class="quote">
&#8220;I am a manufacturer engaged in turning out precision instruments for aircraft. I have a daughter and a daughter-in-law, both of whom I could profitably and productively employ; yet they both prefer to drive staff cars in the services, a job that could very well be undertaken by the staff officers concerned. I suggest that the employment of these girls (who are mostly from the so-called &#8216;sheltered classes&#8217;) in the ratio of one chauffeur per car is both wasteful and extravagant. They may, as they are told, be &#8216;doing a grand job of work&#8217;; nevertheless, I beg to suggest that there is a grander and more vital job awaiting them at the factory benches.&#8221; (Letter in the <em>Times</em>, March 5, 1942).
</p>
<p> 
On the other hand, the provision of practical facilities to assist the wider entry of women into industry has moved with extreme slowness.
</p>
<p> 
First, the organised training of women has been very little developed outside the Government training centres, and even the limited numbers trained there are not always employed afterwards on the jobs they have been trained to do. In the factories many employers have been unwilling to introduce training schemes, and the available compulsory powers have not been used to make them do it. Had systematic large-scale training been instituted from the outset of war and carried on for these two and a half years, there would now be an army of skilled women workers able to replace the men on service. The slowness of advance was sharply commented in the debate on man-power in October, 1941:
</p>
<p class="quote">
&#8220;If the training of women in factories is to continue at its present rate without any impetus or initiative from any one except the employers, then I think a thirty years war will produce the requisite numbers of skilled women. The thing has to be done on a very large scale, and if we could have a few directions, with a dash of compulsion for the employers, it would have the support of every right-minded man and woman in the country.&#8221; (Miss Megan Lloyd George, M.P., in the House of Commons on October 8, 1941).
</p>
<p> 
Second, the system of low wages for women has been in practice maintained. Even where the principle of equal pay has been nominally accepted, this has been in practice negated by the classification of &#8220;women&#8217;s jobs&#8221; (the main exceptions have been where the organised men have played an active role, as in bus transport), so that even where women have been doing jobs previously performed by men the rate has been refused on a variety of grounds, such as the breaking up of the job, the need of supervision, etc. The practical outcome is shown in the average earnings of all women workers in July, 1941, of 44s. 4d., and 25s. 2d. for those under eighteen, as against 99s. 3d. for men and 40s. 7d. for youths and boys under twenty-one: this includes overtime, night shifts, piece rates and bonus, and is prior to deductions for taxation. In engineering the average was 48s. 2d. for women and 27s. 10d. for girls. In many industries the average fell below £2 a week. It is worth recalling that in April, 1918, the average earnings of women workers in government shell factories were 42s. 2d. a week (Report of the War Cabinet Committee on Women in Industry). Statistical investigations have shown that only one woman worker in four is single and without dependants, so that the conventional basis for the supposed lower needs of women is built on a myth. The fact that the inequality is a systematic expression of a lower status, and not based on either services or needs, is most clearly shown by the inequality of government rates in service pay, compensation for disability or pensions: thus a male soldier or civilian who is completely disabled through enemy action receives 37s. 6d. a week as a basic pension, while a woman in exactly the same situation (neither is able to work, so that there is no inequality of work done) receives 27s. 6d.
</p>
<p> 
Third, the provision of hostels and adequate transport facilities for women having to work away from home has been very much neglected. Above all, no serious attempt has yet been made to grapple with the practical conditions to make possible the extended entry into industry of married women with children and household obligations, that is, the main reserve of eleven millions, by the extended provision of day nurseries and nursery schools, school feeding and school play centres, communal feeding arrangements, communal laundries, etc. The action of the authorities has been half-hearted and dilatory in the extreme. The number of day nurseries in the whole country by the end of January, 1942, was only 276, providing for 11,000 children, together with 374 approved and 257 projected, making a future grand total of 907, or provision for 36,000 children. This would provide for 18,000 married women on the basis of two children each. Of the 276 actually functioning by the end of January, 1942, only 132 were in operation whole time up to fifteen hours daily (those on part time, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. being no use for factory hours), or provision for less than 6,000 children. The shifting of responsibility between reluctant or obstructive local authorities and dilatory sanctions of the Ministry of Health and Treasury further impedes any serious programme. Yet this is one of the main governing factors to facilitate the further participation of married women in industry, which is in turn the key to. the problem of man-power. With this actual total of 132 whole-time day nurseries in operation throughout Britain at the end of January, 1942, may be compared the total of 23,000 day nurseries in Germany (<em>Times</em>, December 24, 1941). In the Soviet Union, as long ago as 1935, places were provided in creches <em>at the place of work</em> for 5,143,600 children.
</p>
<p> 
While in the present conditions of extreme urgency we cannot wait for an elaborate programme of construction to be fulfilled before endeavouring to extend to the utmost the participation of women, including married women, in industry, and must therefore make shift with all kinds of provisional emergency arrangements, such as part-time work, voluntary care of children among groups of neighbours and even the justly condemned &#8220;minder&#8221; system, the most serious effort must be made to go forward on a bold, large-scale and speedy programme in order to provide the practical conditions which can facilitate the further entry of women into industry. The real question is not the question of compulsion, except in the case of a relatively small minority (the response from the mass of working class women, and from wide sections of independent professional and progressive middle class women has been magnificent in spirit, sacrifice and achievement, in the face of obstacles and discouragement). The real question is to assist in solving the practical difficulties, as well as to combat the political backwardness of large sections of women and the prejudice of met) against their entry into industry.
</p>
<p>
What is needed?
</p>
<p> 
First, a bold, imaginative and large-scale Government programme for the rapid extension of the entry of women into production, in terms of millions, and energetic, generous provision of all necessary practical conditions to facilitate this.
</p>
<p> 
Second, large-scale industrial training of women, with compulsion on employers to carry through adequate training schemes, and effective measures to ensure that employers utilise the maximum proportion of women in accordance with their training.
</p>
<p>
Third, revision of women&#8217;s wages and rates to establish the universal application of the principle of equal pay for equal work and the payment of the rate for the job, whether performed by a man or a woman; raising of the present low rates paid to women where jobs are classified as &#8220;women&#8217;s jobs&#8221;; equal rates for women and men trainees.
</p>
<p> 
Fourth, organisation of improved transport and shopping facilities; improvement of welfare and sanitary provision for women in factories; improvement of housing and billeting arrangements in the case of transfer schemes, with the widest construction of hostels to be run on democratic lines; no transfer without consent in the case of women with dependants.
</p>
<p> 
Fifth, immediate large-scale programme for the establishment of nurseries, canteens and communal feeding centres and communal laundries, in order to diminish the obstacles to the fullest employment of women in industry.
</p>
<p> 
Sixth, an imaginative large-scale political campaign of propaganda and education to reach the masses of women and draw them into active and conscious participation in the democratic anti-fascist fight, as well as to combat the prejudices, both of men and of women, against their full and equal participation.
</p>
<p> 
Seventh, the trade unions to take the initiative in campaigning for and assisting the wider entry of women into industry, fighting to end all wage discrimination, to promote training and to further the interests and organisation of women, and revising all rules and regulations of their organisations which impede the fullest entry of women into industry.
</p>
<p>
The achievement of such a programme is not only of vital importance for victory over Fascism, but will represent a fundamental advance in the position of women in society. It will mean the establishment of new principles of lasting significance for the future of democracy.
