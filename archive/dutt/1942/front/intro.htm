<h3>Britain in the World Front</h3>

<hr class="base" size="1">
<h4>Foreword</h4>

<p class="fst">
At the moment when this book goes to press, a grave and responsible decision stands before the British people. 
</p>
<p>
The launching of the Soviet offensive on May 12 has placed in the hands of Britain and the United States the most favourable opportunity to deliver a parallel offensive in Western Europe in order that the combined strength of the United Nations shall complete the defeat of Hitler this year.
</p>
<p>
Will Britain act in time? Will Britain, with the support of the United States, establish the Second Front in Western Europe this summer? The opportunity of last autumn was lost. We cannot assume that the opportunity of this summer will be repeated. This is now the crucial question of Britain&#8217;s role in the World Front. This question is the pivot of the present international situation.
</p>
<p>
Up to the time of writing, this issue is still undecided. The nation-wide demand for the Second Front in the West is growing. There is a certain change of tone in the recent references of Government leaders to the question, from the previous disparagement, to approval in principle of the aim of the establishment of the Second Front in Western Europe at an unspecified date. It is manifest that a decision for action cannot be announced before action. But an examination of recent Government declarations as a whole (especially the Deputy Prime Minister&#8217;s declaration in the House of Commons on May 19 describing the present moment as &#8220;a pause before the full summer campaign breaks upon us&#8221;) affords no basis for judging that any fundamental change of strategy has yet taken place or any decision for speedy action. There is still no sign of a united allied strategy to combine the entire strength of the alliance in the maximum immediate common offensive action for the aim of victory this year.
</p>
<p>
We cannot afford to delay. The strategic time is now&#8212;when the Soviet forces are already in full action, when the issue is in the balance, when the opportunity is highest, when the European peoples are looking for our action, when our intervention can play a crucial part in the joint victory. There is still time to act, though late. But the sands are running out.
</p>
<p>
Only the most overwhelming united national will and determination can compel the necessary measures for immediate action, overcome all reactionary opposition, and sustain with the full strength of mass support and readiness for sacrifice the necessary action, once initiated. The working class and democratic movement, all who have stood in the forefront of the struggle against fascist barbarism during its decade of terror over Europe and the world, hold now the greatest responsibility in securing this united national mobilisation and action, in order that Britain may play its full part in the World Front for the final destruction of the fascist aims of world domination.
</p>
<p>
This book is directed entirely to the pressing needs of the present hour&#8212;to the manifold tasks which must be fulfilled if the full strength of Britain is to be exerted in the common struggle for the aim of speediest victory. There are a host of controversial issues of the past and of the future which at the appropriate time will repay careful review in order that the full political lessons of the period may be drawn. But the present is no time for recriminations over the past or philosophising over the future. The present hour requires unity in action of all who stand for victory over the fascist enemy in the supreme battle which is now being fought for the future of mankind.
