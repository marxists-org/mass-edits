<h3>Britain in the World Front</h3>

<hr class="base" size="1">
<h4>Chapter I</h4>
<h3>Our Task</h3>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<p class="fst">
THE crisis of our times, which has advanced through so many storms and strains since the opening of the war of 1914, has finally interlocked the fate of all human beings in a single conflict, a war between the world forces of progress and the most bestial and bloodthirsty barbarism which is expressed in Fascism. The defeat of Fascism is the imperative task for the future advance of humanity.
</p>
<p>
To-day this world conflict governs the outlook for every state and nation, for every party and organisation, for every man and woman. It dominates every political question, every question of the working class movement, every practical question for action. The future for Britain depends on the response we are capable of making to its demands.
</p>
<p>
In the tenth year since Hitler came to power, at long last, through harsh experience, after many obstacles and difficulties, after an arduous and zig-zag path, the common front against fascist war aggression, for which the democratic anti-fascist fighters so long strove in vain, is to-day being built up. It is still incomplete, still full of imperfections. But it exists.
</p>
<p>
On January 1st, 1942, the representatives of twenty-six States and nations, led by Britain and the Dominions, the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Chinese Republic, signed the Pact of Alliance &#8220;for victory over Hitlerism.&#8221; This pact gave formal expression to the World Front, to which further adherence is open to all &#8220;nations which are or may be rendering assistance and contributions to the struggle for victory over Hitlerism.&#8221;
</p>
<p> 
Against Hitler&#8217;s much vaunted &#8220;Grand Alliance,&#8221; which consists only of satellite States and puppet Governments ruling over enslaved and terrorised nations, there has come into existence a voluntary partnership of independent States and peoples, reaching to nations and peoples all over the world engaged in a common struggle for the freedom and independence of nations against fascist enslavement.
</p>
<p>
In its broadest character, this World Front is a common front drawing together, not only the States and Governments which constitute the formal alliance, and the organised national endeavour behind these Governments, but the widest range of national liberation, anti-fascist and popular democratic movements in all countries, including in the enemy and enemy-controlled countries, the international working class movement, international cultural movements, corresponding forms of the national front within each country, parties and organisations of varied type, men and women of varied social and political outlook, Conservatives, Liberals, Labour, Communists and non-party, who are all united, from whatever standpoint, in the common liberation struggle in the cause of national independence and human culture against fascist barbarism.
</p>
<p>
Britain in unity with the Soviet Union holds the key position in the vanguard of this battle. The central pillar around which has been built the alliance of the nations for freedom has been and remains the British-Soviet Pact of July 12, 1941. When Britain signed this Pact, it meant the closing of a chapter of many years of hostility to the Soviet Union and support of reaction, which had brought disastrous consequences for Britain and the world, and the opening of a new chapter in which Britain stands ranged with all the most progressive forces of the world.
</p>
<p>
To the British people falls the proud obligation, working and fighting side by side with the Soviet, American and Chinese peoples, and with all the nations struggling for freedom against the world menace of Axis Fascism, to play an active and responsible role in the vanguard of the battle through all the regions of the world reached by their strength.
</p>
<p>
Fascism, which is the enemy of all human progress, is above all the greatest enemy of the working class movement, in the battle against which it grew and rose to power, and for the destruction of which it was originally brought into existence by the most corrupt and degenerate champions of reactionary privilege. It is the deadliest menace in the path of all those who seek to build a new and better society based on equality and true freedom. Therefore, in all the common tasks for the organisation of victory, it is above all the working class and democratic movement which will need to play the leading part to give inspiration to the people, to arouse their highest efforts, to organise their struggle and to be the driving force in every sphere of policy for pressing forward the urgent measures required in the struggle and overcoming every obstacle in the path. The future of the working class movement, and the attainment of all the great positive aims for which it stands, depends on the fulfilment of this responsibility in the present conflict.
</p>
<p>
Fascism in its hatred of all humanity has declared war on every man, woman and child. The bombing of Guernica, Shanghai, Warsaw, Belgrade, Rotterdam, London and Moscow; the firing squad and the Gestapo in the conquered countries; the limitless atrocities in the war against the Soviet peoples and the explicit orders of the High Command for methods of extermination against whole populations: all these have shown the character of fascist &#8220;total war.&#8221; The &#8220;total war&#8221; of Fascism combines the most elaborate technique; the utilisation of all the weapons of modern science and invention, and the intensive organisation of whole populations mercilessly regimented for its purposes, with the most systematic and organised brutality and terrorism, the brutalisation of its fighting forces, the inculcation of contempt, on the basis of its racial theories, for all the peoples against whom it fights as &#8220;sub-human,&#8221; and the direction of the utmost savagery of war against the civilian populations, men, women and children.
</p>
<p>
This &#8220;total war&#8221; of Fascism cannot be met by the old methods of easy-going partial effort, dilatory routinism, &#8220;Business as usual&#8221; or protecting profits and privileges in front of 100 per cent. mobilisation. It must be met by the rising of the whole people in holy anger, uniting all their energies, their passion, their heroism and their determination in a single crusade and a single aim&#8212;the destruction of this foul enemy.
</p>
<p>
Clearness of aim, unity, organisation, discipline and self-sacrifice of the entire people are the elements of victory over Fascism. There is no room for ambiguities, complacency, compromises, &#8220;appeasement,&#8221; waverings or vacillation or half-heartedness in the fight.
</p>
<p>
To achieve victory over Fascism, this most cunning and desperate enemy, and to carry out our responsibilities in the great alliance of the peoples for this aim, we must
</p>
<p class="indent">
(1) ensure the maximum participation of the full strength of this country in the joint effort, military, economic and political;
</p>
<p class="indent">
(2) organise production for victory and elicit the democratic initiative of the masses of the people;
</p>
<p class="indent">
(3) build up the closest unity in spirit and effort of the civilian population and of those serving in the armed forces; 
</p>
<p class="indent">
(4) overcome every reactionary obstruction and defeat all man&#156;uvres of the pro-fascist enemies of the nation;
</p>
<p class="indent">
(5) ensure a leadership in the Government and in all commanding positions representative of the unity of the nation for these aims;
</p>
<p class="indent">
(6) draw close the co-operation of the peoples all over the world, including in the countries of the Empire, and also in the enemy-occupied and in the enemy countries, for the speediest destruction of Fascism;
</p>
<p class="indent">
(7) maintain and strengthen British-Soviet unity and co-operation in every field, and carry it forward, through the present struggle and through victory, in the future tasks of international co-operation.
</p>
<p class="indent">
(8) make secure the victory, when won, by the establishment of a peace which shall be based on the freedom of the peoples and on the organisation of common action for the maintenance of peace against all aggression; and to lead the way to the further advance which then becomes possible.
</p>
<p>
The fulfilment of these tasks is the condition of victory over Fascism.
</p>
<p>
The conditions under which we have to organise our struggle are not easy. In a society built on social inequality, rent with divisions, and with deep unsolved economic and political problems, we have now to achieve that unity of will and action which can alone defeat the common enemy, whose defeat is the condition of all further advance. But it must be done. The obstacles must be overcome. National unity in the struggle must be achieved.
</p>
<p>
A heavy price has to be paid for past reactionary policies and long continued weaknesses in leadership, policy and organisation. The paying of this price is not yet completed; and we must be prepared in consequence for still further reverses and disappointments until the lesson is learned. The war demands the overcoming of a host of legacies of disorganisation, inefficiency, the stranglehold of vested interests, and anti-democratic prejudices and reaction from the past. The more speedily we learn the lessons and act on them, carrying through the changes that are necessary, the more speedy will be the victory on which all further advance in finally overcoming the roots of these evils depends.
</p>
<p>
The present book has been prepared, at this fateful turning-point in the history of the British people, to assist in the fulfilment of these tasks.
