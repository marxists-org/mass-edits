<h1>Report on the Political Situation</h1>
<h3>1920</h3>
<hr>

<p class="fst">The appeal which you have just approved already describes the 
political situation. The political situation is presently best characterised by 
clearly realising that the bourgeoisie is split into two contesting fractions. 
And this is so not only in Germany, but also in the camp of the Entente. The 
first is the fraction to which the militarists and heavy industrialist belong, 
which arms the reaction and stands for the maintenance of the residents' 
militia, taking its mood from the Hungarian events. In England, this is the 
weaker fraction which wants to give Poland military aid. The leading power among 
the bourgeoisie which is battle-ready is the French bourgeoisie, and precisely 
because it sees itself threatened by an economic and financial collapse, because 
it has no more time to wait upon the peaceful methods of the English fraction. 
The other fraction is that which in England is represented by Lloyd George and 
in Germany by the Democratic Party. It is the direction which believes it can 
once again deal with the problem of the day, the World Revolution, through 
negotiations. This fraction, which still has time for such negotiations and ways 
of behaving, is therefore led by the English bourgeoisie, which is much less 
threatened by the collapse of the Western European economy. You could almost 
believe that our German Centre Parties are serious in the neutral application of 
the disarmament law, that they really would like to disarm both sides and 
participate in the English affair in Russia. But it must be clear that this 
fraction cannot win in the long run, and precisely because they have nothing to 
fight with. The material means of fighting are in the hands of the extreme 
right, whereas the mass action tool of struggle lies in the hands of the working 
class. This fraction of negotiators must be worn away in the struggle between 
the real powers. Support for the reactionary fraction is, in the main, localised 
in Hungary, Bavaria and East Prussia. Starting from Bavaria and Hungary they 
will try to create a reactionary block to crush Austria. The situation there is 
exactly the opposite to ours, where in the course of time a revolutionary block 
will be created which will crush the third reactionary outpost, the Polish 
nobility and the Polish bourgeoisie. One of the key areas is necessarily Upper 
Silesia; for only on its basis will the economic power be found which is 
necessary for the conduct of every war. On the other hand, as far as the Western 
coal fields are concerned, it must be assumed that they will fall into the hands 
of the reaction. The midday edition of today's paper carries a credible report 
according to which the Polish preparations for &quot;aid for Poland&quot; have been 
undertaken and a mass of rail workers has been assembled at the border, as they 
are naturally assuming that in Germany the rail workers will resist the 
transport of French troops through Germany. They want to break this resistance 
by using their own workers. For this reason, we must assume that the French 
bourgeoisie will soon push forward, because their situation forces them to look 
for a rapid solution, and that we will have the reactionary struggle brought 
into the country from the West.</p>

<p class="fst">Our internal situation is, on the contrary, focussed on the 
question of the disarmament law. I would be happy if we still had time to stage 
a great manoeuvre against the law, but we do not have time for this. It would be 
better if we did. For I don't believe that our organisation is sufficiently 
prepared for the economic and military struggle for us to take up the struggle 
with a good conscience and a clear belief in success. It would be better, I 
believe, if we could focus interest on the disarmament action and could then see 
where the hidden weaknesses of our organisation were, where things could be 
improved, so that we could be in the position to bring the USPD masses to us. We 
must keep our eye open, so that we do not miss any phase pass by in which we 
could, through direct connections with the proletariat, make clear the 
inhibitions and betrayals of the USPD leaders. We already know that this will 
happen and we are tying the masses ever more tightly to our slogans. If we think 
of the possibility of a reactionary action from the West being carried into the 
country, we must also think for a moment of a second danger: the danger of a 
nationalist intoxication, which could, under certain circumstances, pass through 
the country. We can be sure that the militarists will try all sorts of things. 
The politics of the reactionary papers are clearly those of preparation for an 
alliance with Russia against the West. The interests of the militarists are 
completely clear in following a line, and this line can only be carried out, if 
they succeed in confusing our thoughts, so that the masses are drawn into a 
common fight with Russia against the West, but under the leadership of 
reactionary militarists. This is a real danger which we must not underestimate. 
Germany does not consist of industrial cities alone. In the open countryside 
nationalist ideology is still deeply rooted. There would be a swarm of 
volunteers from the countryside. We must be prepared for this danger and stop 
this situation from being used by the old ruling caste to put itself in the 
saddle again. The Hamburg tendency is a most dangerous contribution to these 
reactionary politics.</p>

<p class="fst">It remains the fact that piecemeal actions are one of the 
greatest dangers for the proletariat. It is an ancient basic tenet of the 
militarists to strike down the first unit that marches, before it can form an 
army. This theory is inbred in the bone of our reaction and it is clear that 
they will act according to it. The slogans of the day must also be clear, so 
that the enemy only comes up against an undivided front and never find the 
opportunity of knocking out groups one by one. This question of centralism must 
not be considered as before, but only from this purely practical standpoint. I 
believe that, if we do not march forwards too quickly or too slowly in the 
coming struggles, we can arrive at our first goal. May our next Congress fall in 
a much more difficult situation: one where we must defend what we have won.
