<h3><a name="h1">I. The Significance of Bolshevism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">1. In Soviet Economy and the Soviet State, bolshevism has created 
for itself a closed field of social practice. In the Third International, it has 
organized an instrument for controlling and influencing the labor movement on 
international paths. Its directives in matters of principle and tactics are 
elaborated in "Leninism." The question arises: Is the Bolshevik theory, as 
Stalin says, Marxism in the epoch of imperialism and the social revolution? Is 
it, accordingly, the axis of the revolutionary movement of the proletariat on an 
international scale?</p>

<p class="fst">2. Bolshevism obtained its international reputation in the 
proletarian class movement, first, by its consistent revolutionary struggle 
against the World War of 1914-18 and, secondly, by the Russian Revolution of 
1917. Its world-historic importance lies in the fact that, under the consistent 
leadership of Lenin, it recognized the problems of the Russian. Revolution and 
at the same time created, in the Bolshevist Party, the instrument by which those 
problems could be practically solved. The adaptation of Bolshevism to the 
problems raised by the Russian Revolution was brought about by 20 years of 
painstaking and consistent development with the aid of insight into the 
fundamental class questions involved.</p>

<p class="fst">3. The question of whether this successful mastery of its tasks 
entitles Bolshevism to leadership, in theory, tactic and organization of the 
international proletarian revolution involves, on the one hand, an examination 
of the social bases and preconditions of the Russian Revolution, and, on the 
other, of the problems of the proletarian revolution in the great capitalist 
countries.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">II. The Preconditions of the Russian Revolution</a></h3>

<p class="fst">4. Russian society was decisively conditioned by its position 
between Europe and Asia. While the more progressive economic force and the 
stronger international position of Western Europe destroyed in Russia, before 
the end of the Middle Ages, the first beginnings of a commercial capitalist 
development, the political superiority of oriental despotism created the 
foundations for the absolutist state apparatus of the Russian Empire. Russia 
thus occupied, not only geographically but also economically and politically, an 
intermediate position between the two continents, combining their different 
social and political systems in its own peculiar way.</p>

<p class="fst">5. This internationally ambiguous position of Russia has 
decisively influenced not only its remote past, but also the problems of its 
revolution in the first two decades of the 20th century. The capitalist system 
in the era of imperialist upswing created two mutually opposed but intimately 
interlaced centers: the highly developed capitalist center of active imperialist 
advance in the strongly industrialized area of Western Europe and North America, 
and the colonial center of passive imperialist plunder in the agricultural 
regions of Eastern Asia. The class menace to the imperialist system thus arises 
from both these centers: the international proletarian revolution finds its 
pivot in the highly developed capitalist countries of Europe and America, the 
national agrarian revolution in the peasant countries of Eastern Asia. In 
Russia, which stood at the dividing point between the spheres of influence of 
the two imperialist centers the two revolutionary tendencies were mingled.</p>

<p class="fst">6. The Russian economy was a combination of antiquated agrarian 
production characteristic of Asia, and of modern industrial economy 
characteristic of Europe. Serfdom in various forms survived in practice for an 
enormous majority of Russian peasants. The small beginnings of capitalist 
agriculture were thus hindered in their development. They merely caused the 
breaking up of the Russian village, its indescribable pauperization, while 
leaving the peasant chained to a soil which no longer was able to nourish him. 
Russian agriculture, embracing four-fifths of the Russian population and more 
than half the total production, was until 1917 a feudal economy sprinkled with 
capitalistic elements. Russian industry was engrafted upon the country by the 
czarist regime, which wanted to be independent of foreign countries, especially 
in the production of army supplies. Since, however, Russia lacked the basis of a 
well developed system of handicrafts and the rudiments for the building of a 
class of "free laborers," this state capitalism, though born as mass production, 
created no wage-working class. It was a system of capitalistic serfdom, and 
preserved strong traces of this peculiarity down to 1917 in such features as the 
mode of wage payments, barracking of the workers, social legislation, etc. The 
Russian workers were therefore not only technically backward, but also to a 
great extent illiterate and in large part directly or indirectly bound to the 
village. In many branches of industry, the labor force was made up mainly of 
seasonal peasant workers who had no permanent connection with the city.</p>

<p class="fst">Russian industry until 1917 was a system of capitalist production 
interspersed with feudal elements. Feudal agriculture and capitalist industry 
were thus mutually penetrated with each other's basic elements and had been 
combined into a system which could neither be governed by feudal principles of 
economy nor furnish the foundations for an organic development of its 
capitalistic elements.</p>

<p class="fst">7. The economic task of the Russian Revolution was, first, the 
setting aside of the concealed agrarian feudalism and its continued exploitation 
of the peasants as serfs, together with the industrialization of agriculture, 
placing it on the plane of modern commodity production; secondly, to make 
possible the unrestricted creation, of a class of really "free laborers", 
liberating the industrial development from all its feudal fetters. Essentially, 
the tasks of the bourgeois revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">8. It was on this foundation that the state of czarist absolutism 
arose. The existence of this State depended on an equilibrium between the two 
possessing classes, neither of which was able to dominate the other. If 
capitalism furnished the economic backbone of that State, its political prop was 
provided by the feudal nobility. "Constitution," ''right to vote," and system of 
"self-government" could not conceal the political impotence of all classes in 
the czarist State which, under the conditions of the country's economic 
backwardness, produced a method of government which was a mixture of European 
absolutism and Oriental despotism.</p>

<p class="fst">9. Politically, the tasks confronting the Russian Revolution 
were: the destruction of absolutism, the abolition of the feudal nobility as the 
first estate, and the creation of a political constitution and an administrative 
apparatus which would secure politically the fulfillment of the economic task of 
the Revolution. The political tasks of the Russian Revolution were, therefore, 
quite in accord with its economic presuppositions, the tasks of the bourgeois 
revolution.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">III. The Class Groupings of the Russian Revolution</a></h3>

<p class="fst">10. Due to the peculiar social combination of feudal and 
capitalistic elements, the Russian Revolution was also confronted with 
complicated tasks. It differed in essence as fundamentally from the classic 
bourgeois revolution as the social structure of Russian absolutism at the 
beginning of the 20th century differed, say from that of French absolutism in 
the 17th century.</p>

<p class="fst">11. This difference, corresponding to the dissimilar economic 
foundation, found its clearest political expression in the attitude of the 
various classes of Russia toward Czarism and the revolution. From the standpoint 
of their economic interests, all these classes were fundamentally in opposition 
to Czarism. In political practice, however, this opposition differed not only in 
degree but was quite different also in its aim and goal.</p>

<p class="fst">12. The feudal nobility fought fundamentally only for the 
extension of its influence over the absolutist State, wishing to keep it intact 
for the safeguarding of its privileges.</p>

<p class="fst">13. The bourgeoisie numerically weak, politically dependent and 
directly bound to Czarism through state subsidies, made numerous shifts in its 
political orientation. The Decembrist movement of 1825 was their only 
revolutionary attack on the absolutist State. At the time of the terrorist 
movement of the Narodniki in the 70's and 80's, they supported the revolutionary 
movement passively for the purpose of strengthening the pressure on Czarism. 
They also attempted to utilize, as a means of pressure, the revolutionary strike 
movements down to the October struggles of 1905. Their aim was no longer the 
overthrow but the reform of Czarism. During the parliamentary period from 1906 
to the spring of 1917 they entered upon a phase of cooperation with Czarism. 
Finally, the Russian bourgeoisie, in flight from the consequences of the 
revolutionary struggles of the proletarian and peasant masses arrived at 
unconditional surrender to czarist reaction in the period of the Kornilov 
Putsch, which was designed to re-establish the former power of the Czar. It 
became counter-revolutionary even before the tasks of its own revolution had 
been accomplished. The first class characteristic. of the Russian Revolution is, 
therefore, the fact that as a bourgeois revolution it had to be carried through 
not only without but directly against the bourgeoisie. Thus arose a fundamental 
alteration of its whole political character.</p>

<p class="fst">14. In conformity with their overwhelming majority, the peasants 
became the social group which at least passively determined the Russian 
Revolution. While the numerically less important capitalistic-middle and 
upper-peasantry represented a liberal, petty-bourgeois policy, the preponderant 
number of famishing and enslaved small peasants were forced by elemental 
necessities into the course of violent expropriation of the large estates. 
Unable to pursue a class policy of their own, the Russian peasant elements found 
themselves compelled to follow the leadership of other classes. Until February 
1917 they had, on the whole, despite sporadic revolts, been the firm basis of 
Czarism. As a result of their massive immobility and backwardness, the 1905 
revolution collapsed. In 1917 they were decisive in bringing about the end of 
Czarism, which had organized them in great social units in the army, in that 
they passively crippled the conduct of the war. By their primitive but 
irresistible revolts in the villages during the further course of the 
Revolution, thus doing away with the large estates, they created the necessary 
conditions for the victory of the Bolshevik revolution which, during the years 
of civil war, was able to maintain itself only by reason of their further active 
assistance.</p>

<p class="fst">15. In spite of its backwardness, the Russian proletariat 
possessed great fighting strength, due to the merciless schooling of the 
combined czarist and capitalist oppression. It threw itself with enormous 
tenacity into the actions of the Russian bourgeois revolution and became its 
sharpest and most reliable instrument. As each of its actions, through the clash 
with Czarism, became a revolutionary one, it developed a primitive 
class-consciousness which in the struggles of 1917, especially in the 
spontaneous taking over of dominant enterprises, raised itself to the height of 
subjective communist will.</p>

<p class="fst">16. The petty-bourgeois intelligentsia played a distinct role in 
the Russian Revolution. Intolerably restricted in material and cultural matters, 
hindered in professional progress, schooled in the most advanced ideas of 
Western Europe, the best forces of the Russian intelligentsia stood in the 
forefront of the revolutionary movement, and by their leadership imprinted upon 
it a petty-bourgeois, jacobinical stamp. The Russian social-democratic movement, 
in its professional-revolutionary leader-element, constitutes primarily a party 
of the revolutionary petty-bourgeoisie.</p>

<p class="fst">17. For the class solution of the problems presented by the 
Russian Revolution, there arose a peculiar combination of forces. The enormous 
peasant masses formed its passive foundation; the numerically weaker but 
revolutionarily strong proletarian masses represented its fighting instrument; 
the small element of revolutionary intellectuals arose as the master mind of the 
Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">18. This class triangle was a necessary development of czarist 
society which was ruled politically by the absolutist, independent State, based 
on the disfranchised possessing classes; the feudal nobility and the 
bourgeoisie. The peculiar problems involved in accomplishing the bourgeois 
revolution without and against the bourgeoisie grew, out of the necessity for 
the overthrow of Czarism, of mobilizing the proletariat and peasantry in the 
struggle for their own interests and thereby destroying not only Czarism but the 
existing forms of feudal and capitalist exploitation. Numerically, the peasants 
would have been able to handle the matter alone, but were politically not in a 
position to do so as they were unable to actualize their class interests except 
by subordinating themselves to the leadership of some other class element which 
in a certain measure determined to what degree the class interests of the 
peasantry were carried through. The Russian workers developed, in 1917, the 
beginnings of an independent communist class policy, but lacked the social 
presuppositions for their victory, which as a victory of the proletarian 
revolution would have had to be a victory also over the peasantry. This was 
impossible for the Russian proletariat which, in its various strata, numbered 
but ten millions. Accordingly they&#8212;just like the peasants&#8212;had to subordinate 
themselves to the leadership of a group of intellectuals not organically bound 
up with their interests.</p>

<p class="fst">19. The creation of the organized leadership of the Russian 
Revolution and the development of an appropriate tactic is the merit of the 
Bolsheviks. They accomplished the seemingly hopeless task of creating the 
contradictory alliance between the peasant masses fighting for private property 
and the proletariat fighting for communism, thus making the revolution under its 
difficult conditions possible and assuring its success by binding together this 
contradictory peasant-worker combination with the iron links of their party 
dictatorship. The Bolsheviks constitute the leadership party of Russia's 
revolutionary petty-bourgeois intelligentsia; they accomplished the historical 
task of the Russian Revolution, namely, the fitting of history to the back of 
the bourgeois-revolutionary peasantry combined with the revolutionary working 
class.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">IV. The Essence of Bolshevism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">20. Bolshevism has all the fundamental characteristics of 
bourgeois revolutionary policy intensified by the insight (taken over from 
Marxism) into the laws of movement of social classes. Lenin's phrase, "the 
revolutionary social democrat is the Jacobin linked with the masses," is more 
than an external comparison. It is rather an expression of the inner 
technico-political affinity with the movement of the revolutionary 
petty-bourgeoisie of the French revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">21. The basic principle of Bolshevik policy&#8212;the conquest and 
exercise of power by the organization&#8212;is jacobinical. The guiding line of the 
great political perspective and of its realization through the tactic of the 
Bolshevik organization fighting for power is jacobinical; the mobilization of 
all suitable means and forces of society for the overthrow of the absolutist 
opponent, combined with the application of all methods which promise success; 
zigzagging and compromising with any social force which may be used, if even for 
the shortest time and in the least important sector of the struggle. The 
fundamental idea of bolshevist organization, finally, is jacobinical., the 
creation of a strict organization of professional revolutionists which will 
remain a pliant tool of omnipotent leadership.</p>

<p class="fst">22. Theoretically, Bolshevism has by no means developed a thought 
structure of its own which could be considered a closed system. It has, rather, 
taken over the Marxist method of looking at classes and adapted it to the 
Russian revolutionary situation, i.e., basically changed its content while 
maintaining its concepts.</p>

<p class="fst">23. The one ideological achievement of Bolshevism is the 
connecting of its own political theory as a whole with philosophical 
materialism. As a radical protagonist of the bourgeois revolution, it falls upon 
the radical philosophical ideology of the bourgeois revolution and makes it the 
dogma of its own view of human society. This fixation upon philosophical 
materialism is accompanied by a continual backsliding into philosophical 
idealism which considers political practice as in the last instance the 
emanation of the action of leaders. (Treason of reformism; idolatry of Lenin and 
Stalin.)</p>

<p class="fst">24. The organization of Bolshevism arose out of the 
Social-democratic circles of intellectual revolutionists and developed through 
factional struggles, splits and defeats into an organization of leaders with the 
dominant positions in the hands of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals. Its 
further growth., favored by the continuously illegal situation, established it 
as a political organization of military character, based on professional 
revolutionists. Only through such a straight-laced instrument of leadership 
could the Bolshevik tactic be carried through and the historical task of 
Russia's revolutionary intelligentsia be fulfilled.</p>

<p class="fst">25. The Bolshevik tactic, in the service of pursuing the conquest 
of power by the organization, revealed&#8212;especially up to October 1917&#8212;a powerful 
inner consistency. Its continual outer fluctuations were essentially only 
temporary adaptations to altered situations and to altered relations of forces 
between the classes. In accordance with the principle of absolute subordination 
of the masses to the end, without any consideration of the ideological effect on 
the classes which it led, the tactic was overhauled even in apparently 
fundamental questions. It was the task of the functionaries to make each of 
these manoeuvres understandable to the "masses." On the other hand, every 
ideological stirring among the masses, even when fundamentally in contradiction 
to the party program, was utilized. That could be done because the only issue 
was the unconditional capture of masses for its policy. It had to be done 
because these masses, workers and peasants, had contradictory interests and a 
completely different consciousness. Precisely for this reason, however, the 
tactical method of Bolshevism reveals its connection with 
revolutionary-bourgeois policy; it is, in fact, the method of that policy which 
Bolshevism actualizes.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">V. The Directors of Bolshevist Policy</a></h3>

<p class="fst">26. The goal which furnished the starting point of Bolshevism is 
the overthrow of the czarist system. As an attack on absolutism, it is of 
revolutionary-bourgeois character. To this goal is subordinated the struggle 
about the tactical line within the Russian social-democracy. In this struggle, 
Bolshevism develops its methods and slogans.</p>

<p class="fst">27. It was the historical task of Bolshevism to weld together, by 
its leadership tactic, the rebellion of the proletariat and peasantry, who stood 
on quite different social planes, to the end of common action against the feudal 
State. It had to combine the peasant revolt (action of the bourgeois revolution 
at the beginning of the development of bourgeois society) with the proletarian 
revolt (action of the proletarian revolution at the end of the development of 
bourgeois society) into a unified action. It was able to do this only by reason 
of the fact that it unfolded a grand strategy in which use was made of the most 
diverse class stirrings and tendencies.</p>

<p class="fst">28. This utilization strategy begins with the willingness to 
capitalize the smallest splits and cracks in the opponent's camp. Thus Lenin 
once spoke of the liberal proprietors as "our allies of tomorrow," while at 
another time he came out for support of the priests who turned against the 
government because of their material neglect. He was also ready to support the 
religious sects persecuted by Czarism.</p>

<p class="fst">29. The clarity of Lenin's tactic however reveals itself in the 
fact that, especially as result of the experiences of 1905, he posed the 
question of the "allies of the revolution" on the right line, in that he turned 
more sharply against all compromises with the dominant capitalist groups and 
restricted the policy of the "ally" and of compromises to the. petty bourgeois 
and small-peasant elements, i.e. those elements which, alone, historically, 
could be mobilized for the bourgeois revolution in Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">30. The two-class basis of Bolshevik Policy is expressed broadly 
in the tactical slogan of the "democratic dictatorship of the workers and 
peasants," which in 1905 was made the general guiding line of Bolshevik policy 
and which still carried with it the illusionary idea of some sort of 
parliamentarism without the bourgeoisie. It was later replaced by the slogan of 
a "class alliance between the workers and peasants." Behind this formula was 
concealed nothing but the necessity of setting both these classes in motion for 
the Bolshevik policy of seizing power.</p>

<p class="fst">31. The temporary slogans under which these two classes 
determining for the Russian Revolution were to be ruthlessly subordinated to the 
one purpose of using be mobilized on the basis of their contradictory interests 
the forces of these classes. In order to mobilize the peasantry, the Bolsheviks 
as early as 1905 or thereabouts coined the slogan of "radical expropriation of 
the landed proprietors by the peasants." This slogan could be regarded from the 
peasants' standpoint as an invitation to divide the big estates among the small 
peasants. When the Mensheviks pointed out the reactionary content of the 
Bolshevik agrarian slogans, Lenin informed them that the Bolsheviks had not in 
the least decided what was to be done with the expropriated estates. To regulate 
this matter would be the function of social-democratic policy when the situation 
arose. The demand for expropriation of the large estates by the peasants was 
thus of a demagogic character, but struck the peasants on the dominant point of 
their interests. In like manner, the Bolsheviks have also dropped slogans, among 
the workers, e.g. that of the soviets. Determining for their tactic was merely 
the momentary success of a slogan which was by no means regarded as an 
obligation of principle on the part of the party with respect to the masses, but 
as a propagandistic means of a policy having for its final content the conquest 
of power by the organization.</p>

<p class="fst">32. In the period 1906-14, Bolshevism developed, in the 
combination of legal with illegal activity, the tactic of "revolutionary 
parliamentarism." This tactic was in accord with the situation of the bourgeois 
revolution in Russia. With the aid of this tactic, it succeeded in linking the 
day-to-day guerrilla warfare between the workers and Czarism, and between the 
peasants and Czarism, into the great line of preparation for the bourgeois 
revolution under Russian conditions. In particular, each step in parliamentary 
activity on the part of the Russian social democracy bore, in consequence of 
czarist dictatorial policy, a bourgeois-revolutionary character. In its tactic 
of mobilizing the two decisive classes of the Russian Revolution in the altered 
situation between the revolution of 1905 down to the World War, this aim was 
further pursued and the Duma was used as a tribune for its propaganda among the 
workers and peasants.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h6">VI. Bolshevism and the Working Class</a></h3>

<p class="fst">33. Bolshevism has solved the historical problems of the 
bourgeois revolution in feudal-capitalist Russia with the aid of the proletariat 
as the active, fighting instrument. It has also appropriated the revolutionary 
theory of the working class and transformed that theory to suit its purposes. 
"Marxism-Leninism" is not Marxism, but a filling of the Marxist terminology 
adapted to the needs of the bourgeois revolution in Russia with the social 
content of the Russian Revolution. This theory becomes, in the hands of the 
Bolsheviks, and in spite of its being a means of understanding the class 
structure and tendencies of Russia, also the means of veiling the actual class 
content of the Bolshevik revolution. Behind the Marxist concepts and slogans is 
concealed the content of a bourgeois revolution which had to be brought about, 
under the leadership of a revolutionary petty-bourgeois intelligentsia, by the 
united assault of a socialistically oriented proletariat and a peasantry tied to 
private property, against czarist absolutism, land-owning nobility and the 
bourgeoisie.</p>

<p class="fst">34. The absolute claim to leadership on the part of the 
revolutionary, petty-bourgeois and jacobinical intelligentsia is concealed 
behind the Bolshevik conception of the role of the Party among the working 
class. The petty-bourgeois intelligentsia could expand its organization into an 
active revolutionary weapon only on condition of attracting and making use of 
proletarian forces. It therefore called its jacobinical party proletarian. The 
subordination of the fighting working class to the petty-bourgeois leadership 
was justified by Bolshevism on the theory of the "vanguard" of the proletariat&#8212;a 
theory which it extended in practice to the principle that the party is the 
embodiment of the class. The Party, that is, is not an instrument of the 
working-class, but the working-class an instrument of the Party.</p>

<p class="fst">35. The necessity for basing Bolshevik policy on the two lower 
classes of Russian society is transcribed by Bolshevism into the formula of a 
"class alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry" an alliance in which 
logically antagonistic class interests are consciously lumped together.</p>

<p class="fst">36. The demand for unconditional leadership of the peasantry is 
disguised by Bolshevism with the formula of the "primacy of the proletariat in 
the revolution." As the proletariat in its turn is ruled by the Bolshevik Party, 
the "primacy of the proletariat" means the primacy of the Bolshevik Party and 
its claim to governing both classes.</p>

<p class="fst">37. The Bolshevik pretension of seizing power with the support of 
two classes finds its highest expression in the Bolshevik concept of the 
"dictatorship of the proletariat." In conjunction with the concept of the Party 
as the absolute leader-organization of the class, the formula of the proletarian 
dictatorship naturally means mastery on the part of the jacobinical-bolshevik 
organization. Its class content is furthermore completely done away with by the 
bolshevik definition of the dictatorship of the proletariat as the "class 
alliance between proletariat and peasantry under the primacy of the 
proletariat." (Stalin and the program of the Comintern.) The Marxist principle 
of the dictatorship of the working class is thus distorted by Bolshevism into 
the rule over two opposed classes by the jacobinical party.</p>

<p class="fst">38. The bourgeois character of the Bolshevik revolution is 
underscored by the Bolsheviks themselves, in their revised slogan of the 
"people's revolution," i.e., the common struggle of different classes of a 
people in one revolution. That is the typical slogan of every bourgeois. 
revolution which behind a bourgeois leadership brings masses of petty-bourgeois 
peasants and proletarians into action for its own class aims.</p>

<p class="fst">39. In view of the organization's struggle for power over the 
revolutionary classes, every democratic attitude of Bolshevism becomes a mere 
tactical chess move. This has been proved particularly in the question of 
workers' democracy in the soviets. The Leninist slogan of March 1917, "all power 
to the soviets," bore the typical two-class aspect of the Russian Revolution for 
the soviets were the "councils of workers, peasants and soldiers" (i.e. again 
peasants). Furthermore, the slogan was mere tactic. It was put forth by Lenin in 
the February revolution because it seemed to assure the "peaceful" transition of 
control from the social-revolutionary Menshevik coalition to the Bolsheviks by 
the increase of their influence in the soviets. When, after the July 
demonstration, the influence of the Bolsheviks over the soviets declined, Lenin 
temporarily abandoned the soviet slogan and demanded the organization of other 
slogans of insurrection by the Bolshevik Party. It was only when, as a result of 
the Kornilov Putsch, the bolshevik influence in the soviets again sharply 
increased, that Lenin's party again took up the soviet slogan. Since the 
Bolsheviks regarded the soviets preponderantly as organs of insurrection instead 
of as organs of self-government of the working class, they made it all too clear 
that to them the soviets were only a tool by the aid of which their party could 
take over the power. This has been demonstrated in general practice, not only by 
their organization of the soviet state after the conquest of power, but also in 
the special case of the bloody repression of the Kronstadt rebellion. The 
peasant-capitalist demands of this insurrection were granted by the NEP; its 
proletarian-democratic demands, however, were drowned in working-class blood.</p>

<p class="fst">40. The struggle over the content of the Russian soviets led, as 
early as 1920, to the formation of a genuine, though on the whole still weak, 
communist current in the party. The workers' opposition (Utyanikov) represented 
the idea of carrying through soviet democracy for the working-class. Like all 
other serious oppositions of this nature, later on, it was eradicated by 
imprisonment, exile and military execution, but its platform remains as the 
historical starting point for an independent, proletarian-communist movement 
against the Bolshevik regime.</p>

<p class="fst">41. The attitude of the Bolsheviks toward the trade union 
question is likewise determined from the point of view of control and leadership 
of the workers by the Bolshevik party. In Russia, the Bolsheviks have completely 
taken away from the trade unions their character of labor organizations by 
governmentalizing and militarizing them by the compulsory character imposed upon 
them after the conquest of power. In other countries, the final result of the 
Bolshevik policy has been to protect the bureaucratic, reformist trade-union 
organizations, and instead of the breaking up of such organisations, the 
Bolsheviks have advocated the "conquest" of their apparatus. They were bitter 
opponents of the idea of revolutionary, industrial organizations because these 
latter embodied democratic democracy. The Bolsheviks fought for the conquest or 
renovation of organizations controlled by the centralistic bureaucracy, which 
they thought to rule from their own command posts.</p>

<p class="fst">42. As a leader-movement of jacobinical dictatorship, Bolshevism 
in all its phases has consistently combatted the idea of self-determination of 
the working class and demanded the subordination of the proletariat to the 
bureaucratized organization. In the discussion which took place, prior to the 
war, on the question of organization within the Second International, Lenin was 
a violent and vindictive opponent of Rosa Luxemburg and supported himself 
outspokenly on the centrist Kautsky, who during and after the war clearly 
revealed his policy of class betrayal. Bolshevism had even then, as constantly 
since, proved that it not only has no understanding of the question of 
developing the consciousness and the class organizations of the proletariat, but 
that it also combats with all means all theoretical and practical attempts to 
develop actual class organizations and class policies.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h7">VII. The Bolshevik Revolution</a></h3>

<p class="fst">43. Bolshevism has called the revolution of February the 
bourgeois revolution, and that of October the proletarian revolution in order to 
be able to pass off its later regime as proletarian class rule and its economic 
policies as socialism. The absurdity of this division of the revolution of 1917 
becomes clear merely from consideration of the fact that in that case a 
development of seven months would have sufficed to create the economic and 
social presuppositions for a proletarian revolution in a country which had just 
entered the process of its bourgeois revolution, i.e. simply to leap an economic 
and social phase of development that would at least require decades. In reality, 
the revolution of 1917 is a quite unitary social process of transformation, 
beginning with the collapse of Czarism and attaining its climax with the 
victorious armed insurrection of the Bolsheviks on November 7th. This violent 
process of transformation is that of Russia's bourgeois revolution under the 
historically created, peculiar Russian conditions.</p>

<p class="fst">44. In this process, the party of the revolutionary, jacobinical 
intelligentsia seized power on the two social waves of peasant and proletarian 
mass insurrection and created in the place of the shattered governing triangle, 
Czarism, nobility, bourgeoisie, the new governing triangle, bolshevism, 
peasantry, working class. Just as the state apparatus of Czarism ruled 
independently over the two possessing classes, so the new Bolshevik state 
apparatus began to make itself independent of its double class basis. Russia 
stepped out of the conditions of czarist absolutism into those of Bolshevik 
absolutism.</p>

<p class="fst">45. Bolshevik policy attains, during the revolutionary period, 
its highest point in the way of embracing and mastering the class forces of the 
revolution. The acme of their revolutionary tactic is reached in the preparation 
and carrying out of the armed insurrection. The question of the violent uprising 
became for the Bolsheviks a question of an exact, thoroughly scheduled and 
planned military action, the head of which as well as its driving and 
controlling force was the Bolshevik Party with its military formations. 
Conception, preparation and execution of the armed insurrection by the 
Bolsheviks bear the obvious stamp of the jacobinical conspiracy, (in the Russian 
Revolution again the only possible policy) that is, of insurrection under the 
peculiar conditions of carrying through the bourgeois revolution against the 
bourgeoisie.</p>

<p class="fst">46. The inner character of the Bolshevik revolution as a 
bourgeois revolution reveals itself in its economic slogans. To the peasant 
masses, the Bolsheviks represented the violent expropriation of the large 
estates by the spontaneous action of the land-hungry small peasantry. They 
perfectly expressed in their agrarian practice and slogans (Peace and Land) the 
interests of the peasants fighting for the security of small private property, 
hence on capitalistic lines, and were thus, on the agrarian question, ruthless 
champions of small-capitalist, hence not socialist-proletarian interests against 
feudal and capitalist landed property.</p>

<p class="fst">47. Nor with regard to the workers were the economic demands of 
the Bolshevik revolution filled with a socialist content. Lenin on several 
occasions repelled with distinct sharpness the Menshevik criticism that 
Bolshevism represented a utopian policy of socialization of production in a 
country not yet ripe for it. The Bolshevists declared that in the revolution it 
was not at all a question of socialization of production, but of control of 
production by the workers. The slogan of control of production served the 
attempt to maintain capitalism as a force for technical and economic 
organization of production, but depriving it of its character of exploitation. 
The bourgeois character of the Bolshevik revolution and the Bolshevik 
self-restriction to this bourgeois economic character, as opposed to the 
consolidation of the results of the overthrow of 1917, could not be shown more 
clearly than in this slogan of control of production.</p>

<p class="fst">48. The elemental force of the workers' attack, on the one hand, 
and the sabotage of the dethroned employers on the other, meanwhile drove the 
Bolshevik industrial policy further into taking over the. industrial enterprises 
by the new governmental bureaucracy. The state economy which at first throughout 
the period of war communism, almost choked from overorganization (Glavkism), was 
denoted by Lenin as state capitalism. The designation of the Bolshevik state 
economy as socialist is a product of the Stalinist era.</p>

<p class="fst">49. Lenin himself had, however, no other fundamental conception 
of socialization of production than that of a bureaucratically conducted state 
economy. To him, the German war economy and the postal service were 
illustrations of socialist organization i.e. economic organization of an 
outright, bureaucratic character, centralistically controlled from above. He saw 
only the technical, not the proletarian, social side of the socialization 
problem. Lenin likewise based himself, and with him Bolshevism in general,, on 
the concepts of socialization propounded by the centrist Hilferding who in his 
"Finance Capital" had sketched an idealized picture of a completely organized 
capitalism. The actual problem in socializing production, i.e. the taking over 
of the enterprises and the organization of economy through the working class and 
its class organisations, the shop councils; Bolshevism has completely passed it 
by. It had to be passed by because the Marxist idea of the association of free 
and equal producers is directly. opposed to the essence of the rule of a 
jacobinical organization, and because Russia did not possess the social and 
economic conditions necessary for socialism. The socialization concept of the 
Bolsheviks is therefore nothing but a capitalist economy taken over by the State 
and directed from the outside and from above by its bureaucracy. The Bolshevik 
socialism is state-organized capitalism.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h8">VIII. Bolshevik Internationalism and the National Question</a></h3>

<p class="fst">50. During the World War, the Bolsheviks represented a 
consistently international standpoint under the slogan "Convert the imperialist 
war into civil war" and had apparently conducted themselves as consistent 
Marxists, But their revolutionary internationalism was as much determined by 
their tactic in the struggle for the Russian Revolution as was later their swing 
to the NEP. The appeal to the international proletariat was only one side of a 
large-laid policy for international support of the Russian revolution. The other 
side was the policy and propaganda of "national self-determination" in which the 
class outlook was even more definitely sacrificed than in the concept of 
"people's revolution," in favour of an appeal to all classes of certain peoples.</p>

<p class="fst">51. This double-faced "two-class internationalism" of the 
Bolsheviks corresponded to the international situation of Russia and of her 
revolution. Russia stands between the two centers of the imperialist world 
system, geographically and sociologically. In Russia, where the active 
imperialist and the passive colonial tendencies met, the system collapsed. The 
reactionary classes of Russia were incompetent to put it together again, as 
their decisive defeat in the Kornilov Putsch and later in the civil war has 
proved. The only real danger threatening the Russian revolution was that of 
imperialist intervention. Only military invasion on the part of imperialist 
capital could strike down Bolshevism and restore Czarism&#8212;the old regime which 
had been built into the world system of imperialist exploitation both as an 
instrument and as material at the same time. The problem of active defense of 
Bolshevism against world imperialism consisted, therefore, in counter-attacking 
in the imperialist centers of power. This was brought about through the 
two-sided international policy of Bolshevism.</p>

<p class="fst">52. With the standpoint of the international proletarian 
revolution, Bolshevism propagated an internal attack by the international 
proletariat on the center of world imperialism in the highly developed 
capitalist countries. With the policy of "the right to national 
self-determination" Bolshevism propagated an attack by the oppressed peasant 
peoples of the Far East on the colonial center of world imperialism. In a 
double-phased international policy adjusted to tremendous perspectives, 
Bolshevism attempted to lengthen the proletarian and peasant arms of its 
revolution into the international stretches of world capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">53. The position of Bolshevism on the "national question" is 
practical, hence not merely an expedient of the bourgeois revolution of its own 
country&#8212;a revolution which wished to strike Czarism with the aid of the national 
instincts of the oppressed peasant elements and nationalities of the Russian 
Empire. It is, at the same time, the peasant internationalism of a bourgeois 
revolution which was accomplished in the age of world imperialism and which 
could hold out in the meshes of the imperialist net only with the aid of an 
internationally oriented and activated counter-policy.</p>

<p class="fst">54. As instruments of Bolshevist leadership for this policy of 
international support for the bourgeois revolution accomplished on Russian soil, 
Bolshevism attempted to create two international organizations: the Third 
International to mobilize the workers of the highly developed capitalist 
countries, and the Peasant International as an organization for Bolshevik 
mobilization of the oriental peasant peoples. As the final guiding thought of 
this international double-class policy there appeared the idea of the world 
revolution, in which the international (European-American) proletarian 
revolution and the national (mainly Oriental) peasant revolution were to be 
riveted into a new international unity of bolshevik world policy under the 
strict leadership of Moscow. Thus the concept of "world revolution" has for the 
Bolsheviks an altogether different class content. It no longer has anything in 
common with the international proletarian revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">55. The international policy of Bolshevism was thus directed to 
repeating the Russian Revolution on a world scale by simultaneous utilization of 
the proletarian and the peasant-bourgeois revolutions and thereby making the 
leadership of the Bolshevik party of Russia the commander of a world bolshevik 
system of coupling together the communist-proletarian and peasant-capitalist 
interests. This policy was insofar positive as it has protected the Bolshevik 
State from imperialist invasion by continually disquietening the capitalist 
States, and thereby has given it time to build itself gradually into the world 
imperialist system again by the capitalist methods of commercial relations, 
economic agreements and non-aggression pacts. It has given Russia the 
opportunity for an unhindered national building up and extension of its own 
internal position. The two-front policy of Bolshevism was negative in that on 
both sides the attempt to carry over the active bolshevik policies onto a world 
scale has collapsed. The experiment of the Peasant International has completely 
broken down with the defeat of bolshevik policy in China. The Third 
International, after the pitiful collapse of the Communist Party of Germany, is 
no longer a factor in bolshevik world policy. The gigantic attempt to transplant 
the bolshevik policy of Russia into world relations is historically a failure, 
and proves the national, Russian limitations of Bolshevism. At any rate, the 
bolshevik experiment in international Machtpolitik has afforded time and space 
for the retreat of Bolshevism onto its national (Russian) position and for the 
conversion to capitalist-imperialist methods of international policy. 
Theoretically, this retreat found its expression in the formula "socialism in 
one country," thereby removing the international ties from the concept of 
"socialism" after the Russian economic practice had already robbed it of its 
proletarian class content, and turned it into a disguise of state-capitalist 
tendencies found as well in reformism and in petty-bourgeois fascism.</p>

<p class="fst">56. Actually, it is unessential, now that we have the results of 
15 years of the bolshevist State and of the bolshevist, international, whether 
Lenin at or before the founding of the Comintern had or had not a different idea 
about the effect of this bolshevist international. In practice, Bolshevism with 
its concept of the "right to national self-determination" has developed the 
tendencies to a world-bolshevik Machtpolitik. It has also, through the 
Comintern, decisively contributed to the result that the European proletariat 
was unable to rise to the height of revolutionary communist insight and instead 
remained stuck in the mud of reformist concepts revived by Bolshevism and 
decorated with revolutionary phrases. Thus it has come about that the concept of 
the "Russian Fatherland" has become the cornerstone of the whole policy of the 
bolshevik parties, whereas for proletarian communism the international working 
class stands at the center of all international orientation.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h9">IX. State Bolshevism and the Comintern</a></h3>

<p class="fst">57. The establishment of the Soviet State was the establishment 
of the rule of the party of bolshevik Machiavellism. The sociological basis of 
this state power, made independent of its supporting classes and creating the 
new social element, of the bolshevist bureaucracy, was composed of the Russian 
proletariat and peasantry. The proletariat, enchained with the methods of 
compulsory membership in the trade unions and the terrorism of the Tcheka, 
formed the basis of the bolshevistic, bureaucratically conducted state economy. 
The peasantry concealed and still conceals in its ranks the private capitalist 
tendencies of that economy. The Soviet State in its inner policy was continually 
being tossed back and forth between the two tendencies. It has attempted to 
master them through violent organizational methods such as the five-year plan 
policy and compulsory collectivization. In practice, however, it has only 
increased the economic difficulties to the danger point of an explosion of the 
economic contradictions by the intolerable over-tensioning of the forces of the 
workers and peasants. The experiment in bureaucratically planned state economy 
can by no means be denoted as a complete success. The great international 
cataclysms threatening Russia are bound to increase the contradictions of its 
economic system till they become intolerable and may enormously hasten the 
collapse of the hitherto gigantic economic experiment.</p>

<p class="fst">58. The inner character of Russian economy is determined by the 
following circumstances: it rests on the foundation of commodity production; it 
is conducted according to the viewpoint's of capitalist profitability; it 
reveals a decidedly capitalist system of wages and speedup; it has carried the 
refinements of capitalist rationalization to the utmost limits. Bolshevist 
economy is state production with capitalistic methods.</p>

<p class="fst">59. This state form of production also produces surplus value, 
which is squeezed out of the workers in fullest measure. The Russian State does 
not, to be sure, reveal any class of people who individually and directly are 
the beneficiaries of the surplus-value production, but it pockets this surplus 
value through the bureaucratic, parasitical apparatus as a whole. In addition to 
its own quite costly maintenance, the surplus value produced serves for the 
expansion of production, the support of the peasant class and as a means of 
settlement for the foreign obligations of the State. So that, in addition to the 
economically parasitical element of the ruling bureaucracy, the Russian 
peasants, as a distinct part of international capital, are the beneficiaries of 
the surplus value produced by the Russian workers. The Russian state economy is 
therefore profit production and exploitation economy. It is state capitalism 
under the historically unique conditions of the bolshevik regime, and 
accordingly represents a different and more advanced type of capitalist 
production than even the greatest and most advanced countries have to show.</p>

<p class="fst">60. The foreign policy of the Soviet Union has been subordinated 
to the point of view of securing the position of the Bolshevist Party and of the 
state apparatus which it controls. Economically, the Russian government fought 
for support of its industrial construction, which was pushed forward with the 
greatest exertions. The isolation of Soviet Russia's economy led to a strenuous 
policy of doing away with the compulsory autarchy while maintaining control of 
the foreign trade monopoly. Commercial treaties, concessionnaire agreements, as 
well as extensive credit arrangements, reestablished the bond of Russian state 
economy with capitalist world production and its markets, into which Russia 
entered partly as a courted customer and partly as a keen competitor. On the 
other hand, the policy of economic attachment to world capital compelled the 
soviet government to cultivate friendly and peaceful relations with the 
capitalist powers. The principles of a bolshevist world policy, where they were 
still propagated, were opportunistically subordinated to the bare commercial 
treaty. The entire foreign policy of the Russian government took on the stamp of 
a typically capitalist diplomacy and thus, in the international sphere, 
definitely tore bolshevist theory loose from bolshevist practice.</p>

<p class="fst">61. In the center of the foreign propaganda of the Comintern, 
Bolshevism placed the thesis of "imperialist encircling of the Soviet Union" 
though such a phrase did not harmonize in the least with the complicated lines 
of imperialistic conflicts of interests and their continually changing 
groupings. It attempted to mobilize the international proletariat for its 
foreign policy and, through a partly parliamentary partly putschist policy on 
the part of the communist parties, to create unrest in the capitalist states 
from within and thereby strengthen the diplomatic and economic position of the 
Soviet Union.</p>

<p class="fst">62. The oppositions between the Soviet Union and the imperialist 
powers led to the ideological counterpropaganda of the Comintern under the 
slogans: "Menace of War against the U.S.S.R.," "Protect the Soviet Union." In 
that the workers were presented with these oppositions as the only and 
determining ones in world policy, they were prevented from gaining an insight 
into the actual realities of international politics. The adherents of the 
communist parties became, before everything else, blind and opportunistic 
defenders of the Soviet Union and were kept in ignorance of the fact that the 
Soviet Union had long ago become a full-fledged factor in imperialist world 
politics.</p>

<p class="fst">63. The continual cry of alarm about an imminent war by the 
combined imperialist powers against the U.S.S.R. served in domestic politics for 
justifying the intensified militarization of labor and the increased pressure on 
the Russian proletariat. At the same time, however, the Soviet Union had and has 
the greatest interest in the unconditional avoidance of any military conflict 
with other States. The existence of the bolshevik government depends internally 
in large measure on the avoidance of all convulsions in the sphere of foreign 
politics, both military as well as revolutionary. Therefore the Comintern has in 
practice, in crying contradiction to its old theory and propaganda, carried on a 
policy of sabotage of all real revolutionary proletarian development and in the 
communist parties somewhat openly spread the conception that the upbuilding of 
the Soviet Union must first be secured before the proletarian revolution in 
Europe can be pressed further. On the other hand, the Russian government has, to 
be sure, employed strong gestures against imperialist powers for the sake of 
prestige, but in practice always capitulated to them. The "sale" of the 
Manchurian railway is an example of the unresisting capitulation of the U.S.S.R. 
to the imperialist opponent. The overhasty recognition of the Soviet Union by 
the United States at the same point of time is, conversely, a proof that the 
imperialist powers, within the bounds of their policy of opposing interests, 
also know how to give a positive value to the factor represented by the Soviet 
Union. But especially has the Soviet Union documented its bond with capitalism 
by arranging and extending particularly close economic relations with Italian 
fascism and Hitler Germany. The Soviet Union appears as a reliable economic, and 
hence also political, support of the most reactionary fascist dictatorships in 
Europe.</p>

<p class="fst">64. The policy of unconditional understanding of the U.S.S.R. 
with capitalist and imperialist States has not only economic grounds. Nor is it 
merely an expression of military inferiority. The Soviet Union's "peace policy" 
is, rather, quite decisively guaranteed by the inner situation of Bolshevism. 
Its existence as an independent state power depends on its success in 
maintaining an equilibrium between the dominated working class and the 
peasantry. In spite of the progress made in industrializing the country, the 
position of the Russian peasantry is still extremely strong. First, in its hands 
still rests in large measure, in spite of all repressive policies from above, 
the decision about the feeding of the country. Secondly, collectivization has 
strengthened not only the economic, but also the political power of the 
peasantry which as before is still fighting for private capitalist interests. 
(For "collectivization" in Russia means a collective union of privately owning 
peasants with the maintenance of capitalistic methods of accounting and 
distribution.) In the third place, finally, a war and the mass arming of the 
peasantry would form the conditions for a renewed and violent peasant revolt 
against the bolshevist system; just as, on the other hand, a revolution by the 
European proletariat would also make probable an open rebellion by the Russian 
workers. On these grounds, the policy of understanding between the Soviet 
government and the imperialist powers is a life necessity of bolshevist 
absolutism.</p>

<p class="fst">65. The Comintern itself has become a tool for the misuse of the 
international working class for the opportunist aims of national glorification 
and the international security policy of the Russian State. It arose, in its 
extra-Russian parts, from combining the revolutionary cadres of the European 
proletariat. By utilizing the authority of the bolshevik revolution, the 
organizational principle and tactic of Bolshevism was forced upon the Comintern 
with the utmost brutality and without regard for immediate splits. The executive 
committee (E.C.C.I.)&#8212;another tool of the leadership of Russia's governmental 
bureaucracy&#8212;was made the absolute commander of all communist parties and their 
policy was completely cut loose from the actual revolutionary interests of the 
international working class. Revolutionary phrases and resolutions served as a 
cloak for the counter-revolutionary policy of the Comintern and its parties, 
which in their bolshevik manner became as adept in working class betrayal and 
unrestrained demagogy as the social-democratic parties had been. Just as 
reformism went down, in the historical sense, on the fusion of its apparatus 
with capitalism, so the Comintern suffered shipwreck by the connection, through 
its apparatus, with the capitalist policy of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h10">X. Bolshevism and the International Working Class</a></h3>

<p class="fst">66. Bolshevism, in principle, tactic and organization, is a 
movement and method of the bourgeois revolution in a preponderantly peasant 
country. It brought the socialistically oriented proletariat and the 
capitalistically oriented peasantry to a revolutionary uprising, under the 
dictatorial leadership of the jacobinical intelligentsia, against the absolutist 
State, feudalism and the bourgeoisie, for the purpose of smashing 
feudal-capitalistic absolutism, and, in a great strategy of turning everything 
to advantage, joined together the opposed proletarian and peasant 
class-interests with the aid of insight into the class character of the laws of 
social development.</p>

<p class="fst">67. Bolshevism is therefore not only unserviceable as a directive 
for the revolutionary policy of the international proletariat, but is one of its 
heaviest and most dangerous impediments. The struggle against the bolshevik 
ideology, against the bolshevik practices and hence against all groups seeking 
to anchor them anew in the proletariat is one of the first tasks in the struggle 
for the revolutionary re-orientation of the working class. Proletarian policy 
can de developed only from the proletarian class ground. and with the methods 
and organizational forms adapted thereto.</p>
