<p class="fst">May 22, 1933 was the day on which our prison term expired. On
 March 21, we sent a declaration to the C.E.C. and the collegium of
 the G.P.U. demanding that we be given permission to depart unhindered
 from Russia upon the expiration of our sentence. We pointed out in
 our declaration that in the event of a refusal or failure to receive
 an answer we would begin, a hunger strike on the day our sentence
 expired, and should the necessity arise, we would not refrain from
 resorting to the most extreme measures, sparing neither our health
 nor lives in the struggle.</P>
<P>A short time ago, I succeeded in obtaining permission to depart.
 Comrade Draguitch, a former member of the C.E.C. of the Jugoslav
 Communist Party, in his struggle to achieve this aim is still
 incarcerated in the secret dungeons of Soviet Guiana, the terrible
 Solovetski Islands, because he attempted to cross the frontiers
 illegally after permission to depart legally was denied him. Comrade
 Deditch, a well known trade union activist in Jugoslavia
 (Herzegovina) is sitting ill, famished, and without employment in
 distant Siberian exile.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Seasons for the Struggle</H4>
<p class="fst">We were so stubborn in insisting upon permission to depart abroad
 for several reasons. First of all, we came to Russia in 1926 only for
 a temporary stay and were supposed to return home after accomplishing
 certain work. By 1933, our mission had long been fulfilled. Secondly,
 there were no possibilities in Russia for doing revolutionary work as
 we understood it, and besides we had infinitely greater possibilities
 abroad. Thirdly, after our harsh experience in Russia we want to
 become directly acquainted also with the experience and the ideas of
 the Western European and American labor movement. And, finally, we
 could not reconcile ourselves with the conduct of the present Soviet
 Government, which permits itself to treat foreign workers and
 revolutionists like slaves, turning them into its perpetual
 prisoners, depriving them of their elementary human rights, seeking
 to strip them of all human dignity. Hundreds of foreign workers and
 revolutionists find themselves in Soviet Russia in the status of
 thinly veiled slavery and captivity. All this is being perpetrated by
 a Government that passes off its regime so persistently and falsely
 as the fatherland of the toilers of the entire world. It is this
 combination of the cynicism of infinite oppression with the cynicism
 of infinite lies to the foreign proletariat that most aroused our
 indignation at the Soviet bureaucratic customs.</P>
<P>Our demand for leave to depart was actively supported by the
 entire communist sector of the prison. In a special declaration to
 the Government, the Elder, in the name of all the imprisoned
 Communists, supported our demand to depart, and placed the
 responsibility for our fate upon the Government. The universal and
 decisive support of the entire isolator (up to and including a hunger
 strike in solidarity) was a manifestation of international
 solidarity, and of a desire to make known through us to the
 international working class the position of the persecuted groups of
 the working class movement in the U.S.S.R.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>A GPU Coup</H4>
<p class="fst">When the GPU saw that matters were heading toward an extensive
 struggle, it executed a maneuver, deciding to remove us from
 Verkhne-Uralsk on a decorous pretext. A few days prior to the
 expiration of our prison term, on May 15, 1933 we were told to
 surrender our correspondence and to get our things ready. To our
 inquiry as to our destination, Bizukov, the warden, replied &ndash;
 Moscow. To the question as to the purpose of the journey, we received
 the answer: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say. Apparently, in order to discuss
 the matter you raised in your declaration.&rdquo;</P>
<P>We were taken away. The isolator sent us off with the warmest
 wishes, but also with some doubts as to whether we were not being
 simply removed to mother prison. Our possessions were examined, our
 persons were searched. We were placed in two autos, comrades Deditch
 and Draguitch in one, myself in the other. The machines started
 together but on the road, the auto with my comrades pulled ahead, and
 disappeared in a cloud of dust. I never saw my comrades again. They
 had separated us. We rode the entire day, and toward evening we
 arrived in the city of Chelyabinsk. I was taken to the Chelyabinsk
 political prison, which held at that time from 50 to 80 people
 (S.R.&rsquo;s, social democrats, Zionists, anarchists, and a few
 communists).<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Chelyabinsk and Hunger Strike</H4>
<p class="fst">When I announced in the prison office that in view of the trick
 with regard to my alleged journey to Moscow, and my being separated
 from my comrades, I would immediately begin a hunger strike, the head
 of the Chelyabinsk isolator. The GPU agent Dupnis told me that in
 that case he refused to accept me, and would send me back to
 Verkne-Uralsk. Once again I was placed in an automobile and carried
 off. But not to Verkne-Uralsk They threw me into the cellar of the
 jail for criminals under the Chelyabinsk militia. I was locked into a
 damp, cold and dark cell. The electric light burned night and day. I
 spent three months in this cellar without ever leaving it for a
 minute, without even seeing the prison yard or the sun ...</P>
<P>I immediately began my hunger strike here. I knew that my comrades
 were also on a hunger strike somewhere, because we had taken into
 consideration all the possibilities beforehand, and had planned how
 to meet them. We had agreed that in the event of our being separated,
 or being taken to some other place than Moscow, we would begin a
 hunger strike immediately. A G.P.U. guard was placed over me: I was
 enrolled under the G.P.U. in the isolator although I was being kept
 in the jail under the militia. On the day of my transfer from
 Verkhne-Uralsk to Chelyabinsk I had received a rotten meal, and I
 therefore began the hunger strike under inauspicious conditions. For
 this reason I began to vomit on the second or the third day, but
 afterwards I began feeling better. I did not feel hungry. When a
 man&rsquo;s consciousness is really profoundly permeated with the
 conviction that he must not touch food, he absolutely does not feel
 the pangs of hunger. He only feels weak. I had already had the
 experience of the great hunger strike of 1931. Of course, the hunger
 strike in this place was made more difficult by the cold and the
 dampness. Half-dressed, wrapped in a blanket I lay the whole time,
 night and day, on the wooden bench. On the tenth day, after midnight
 a group of G.P.U. agents stamped into the cell. Night time is the
 favorite time of the G.P.U. for its work ...<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>A Nocturnal Visit</H4>
<p class="fst">I was already quite spent physically, and even more so mentally.
 Eight days had already elapsed since my demands. Suspense tends
 without any answer from the G.P.U. to strain and weaken spiritual
 resistance more than anything else. The G.P.U. is well aware of this,
 and therefore makes systematic use of this weapon. When the G.P.U.
 agents rushed in, I was dozing, and in the semi-darkness of the cell
 did not at first recognize the intruders. Then I perceived that in
 addition to Dupnis and six G.P.U. agents, there was also present the
 &ldquo;Commission from Moscow&rdquo;, the representatives of the
 collegium of the G.P.U. My old &ldquo;acquaintances&rdquo;:
 citiziness Andreyev, Agranov&rsquo;s assistant, who is in charge of
 all matters relating to the persecuted communist, socialist and
 anarchist groups. There was also the head of the All-Union Department
 of Prisons under the collegium of the G.P.U., citizen Popov, whose
 appearance alone bespoke of his functions. The third member of the
 commission &ndash; the representative of the prosecutor&rsquo;s
 office &ndash; was absent, although, as I learned later, he was
 present on the spot in Chelyabinsk, and used to make the rounds of
 the isolator during the day, together with Andreyev and Popov.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>The Execution of the Poles</H4>
<p class="fst">But inasmuch as my case, coupled with what the commission had to
 tell me, was such a shocking instance of lawlessness, such a cynical
 breach of even formal rights and proletarian morals, the prosecutor&rsquo;s
 office decided, quite reasonably, that it should best be done
 &ldquo;without its knowledge&rdquo;. All the more so since the
 representative of the prosecutor&rsquo;s office was himself a foreign
 communist, a former Polish worker. One should imagine that this
 former Polish worker is today already so &ldquo;Stalinized&rdquo; as
 to be able to now assume upon himself quite openly and brazenly what
 he undertook only shamefacedly in 1933. That is to say, unless he
 happened to be among those fifty important Polish communists who were
 recently shot in Russia without a trial, upon the unverified and
 all-embracing charge of Pilsudskyism, espionage and provocation. (In
 the opinion of the most competent and authoritative representatives
 of the Polish labor movement, the great majority of the executed,
 among them a former deputy to the Polish Sejm, were above all
 suspicion; and that upon investigation any impartial international
 committee would have proved criminal light-mindedness on the part of
 the Soviet ruling organs, if not something worse.)</P>
<P>In the eyes of the present Stalinist leadership, which is
 conducting a nationalist policy, every Pole and German must be held
 suspect, if not directly considered as a &ldquo;spy&rdquo;</P>
<P>I am personally inclined to consider this psychology as the
 underlying reason for the monstrous crime of shooting fifty Polish
 communists. Being somewhat acquainted with the deportment and methods
 of the G.P.U. I can say with certainty that it would not be so bad if
 among the executed there were ten or even five real agents of
 Pilsudsky.</P>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Citizen Ciliga&rdquo;, said Dupnis, &ldquo;the
 representatives of the collegium have something to communicate to
 you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fst">&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; I said rubbing my eyes, fumbling
 for my glasses, and half-raising myself on the bench.</P>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Citizen Ciliga&rdquo;, continued citizeness
 Andreyev, &ldquo;I have the following to communicate to you: the
 collegium of the G.P.U. and the C.E.C. of the U.S.S.R. have rejected
 your demand for permission to depart from the U.S.S.R. ... By the
 order of the collegium of the G.P.U. your prison term has been
 extended for an additional two years ... The G.P.U. refuses to
 recognize your hunger strike and beginning tomorrow you will be fed
 artificially ...&rdquo;</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;The question of the hunger strike and of
 artificial feeding has already become a secondary question,&rdquo; I
 began coldly and deliberately. &ldquo;In answer to the unheard-of
 decision of the G.P.U. and of the Soviet Government, and the refusal
 to allow me to return home although I have already served the prison
 sentence which you yourselves imposed upon me in 1930</I>, <I>to the
 automatic addition of a new prison term which transforms me into your
 perpetual slave and captive. I will resort to the extreme measure
 left me &ndash; suicide. If necessary let my death be the price paid
 for informing the foreign proletariat into what a position you put
 those foreign revolutionists who refuse to become your lackeys. I
 will also inform Moscow of my decision.&rdquo;</I></p>
<p class="fst">&ldquo;A man who decides to commit suicide does not give notice of
 it,&rdquo; objected citizeness Andreyev.</P>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, I said smiling at her, &ldquo;you
 would like to see me dead, provided you do not bear any
 responsibility for it. I am engaged in a political struggle against
 you, and you bear full political responsibility for everything you
 have done and will do to me and my comrades. My official declaration
 is precisely intended to place the responsibility upon you in the
 event of my protest-suicide.&rdquo;<BR>&nbsp;</p>
<H4>&ldquo;We Will Not Permit ...&rdquo;</H4>
<p class="fst">If the death could have been hushed up, the GPU would have not at
 all feared my demise, whether by suicide, firing squad, or as a
 result of an &ldquo;unfortunate incident&rdquo; But after our
 declarations in the Verkhne-Uralsk isolator, and after the
 declaration of the Elder of the collective of the imprisoned
 communists, our fate could not be kept secret any longer. This
 imposed upon the GPU the necessity of employing more cautious
 tactics.</P>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;We will not permit you to commit suicide.&rdquo;
 said citizeness Andreyev. &ldquo;We will assign two GPU agents to
 your cell, and all your things will be immediately removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fst">And she proceeded to issue the necessary orders. I was left only
 with a few toilet articles. But in them was secreted a new sharp
 blade, already smuggled out of the isolator ... I was triumphant. If
 it came to &ldquo;that&rdquo;, I would show them ... For this reason
 I told citizeness Andreyev ironically that a man who finds it
 necessary to do away with himself would not be restrained either by
 soldiers or any other obstacle.</P>
<P>The next morning I sent a telegram to the Moscow collegium of the
 GPU and the C.E.C. of the U.S.S.R. containing a declaration similar
 to the one I had made to Andreyev.</P>
<P>No attempt was made to feed me artificially, but instead I was
 officially told the following:<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>An &ldquo;Official&rdquo; Decree</H4>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The Political Bureau of the C.P. of Jugoslavia has
 passed a resolution approving the decision of the GPU to extend your
 term of imprisonment. This decision of the Political Bureau of the
 Jugoslav Communist Party will be given to you in writing ...&rdquo;</p>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;This is not my Political Bureau,&rdquo; I
 interrupted the orator. &ldquo;These are your mamelukes and their
 decisions are not binding upon me. I do not recognize this Political
 Bureau, I do not belong to any of your communist parties, nor have I
 any intention of belonging to them. Therefore I do not recognize
 their discipline and refuse to submit to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fst">Four days later, Dupnis appeared and informed me that a telegram
 had arrived from Moscow stating that the additional two year prison
 term had been changed to three years exile in Irkutsk.</P>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Irkutsk is a large city not like Chelyabinsk, and
 you will be able to arrange there the matter of your departure more
 quickly,&rdquo; the head of the Chelyabinsk political prison
 diplomatized.<BR>&nbsp;</p>
<H4>A New Columbus Itinerary</H4>
<p class="quoteb">&rdquo;You mean to say that since Columbus&rsquo; route
 from the Mediterranean to India was via America, therefore my
 itinerary from the Urals to Europe is via Irkutsk and Kamchatka,&rdquo;
 I said to him in a similar tone. &ldquo;But no.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I
 want to go from the Urals due West to Europe. Taking into
 consideration the withdrawal of an additional prison term, I withdraw
 the question of the protest-suicide. But I continue with the hunger
 strike for permission to depart home to Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fst">This occurred on the 14th day of the hunger strike. I struck for 9
 more days. Again Dupnis arrived, and told me that a new telegram was
 received from Moscow with instructions for me to go there. I demanded
 that I be given an official written notice to this effect, otherwise
 I would continue the hunger strike. Within half an hour the written
 statement I had demanded was delivered.</P>
<P>I called the hunger strike off; and in two weeks I was over its
 effects. (Dupnis really fed me quite well. He obviously thought that
 he was thus fulfilling his &ldquo;revolutionary and international&rdquo;
 duty; and besides, he was trying to &ldquo;bribe&rdquo; me so that I
 would agree to depart for exile.)</P>
<P>Still, I was not taken to Moscow.</P>
<P>I became nervous again. Finally I learned the answer. The typist
 &ldquo;had made a mistake&rdquo;. The communication from Moscow, it
 seems, read that I <I>would be called</I>, and not that I <I>am being
 called there</I>. A couple of days later, I was told that I must
 leave for Irkutsk.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4><I>En Route</I> to Irkutsk</H4>
<p class="fst">I declared a hunger strike. After these abominations, the question
 of the protest-suicide was again on the order of the day. But a few
 days later, shortly after I began the strike, again in the middle of
 the night, a group of GPU agents burst into my cell and informed me
 of the decision to remove me to exile by force. They packed my
 things, loaded them into an auto, shoved me in, and drove to the
 Chelyabinsk railway station. Thus, towards the end of July,
 accompanied by a convoy of four GPU agents I was taken to Irkutsk.</P>
<P>What to do? After pondering a while, I decided that the first
 stage of my struggle for departure must be considered as closed. The
 battle would have to be resumed in exile, after I had gathered and
 utilized all the possibilities it offered. Having made this decision,
 I called off the hunger strike and began to take note of everything
 new around me. For the first time after three years segregation from
 society, from life, I was on a train, &ldquo;among human beings&rdquo;</P>
