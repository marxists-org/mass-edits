<H3>III. In the Prisons at Leningrad and Verkhne-Uralsk</H3>
<p class="fst">I spent five months (from May to October 1930) in the Detention
 Prison in Leningrad. During the first part of this term, up to the
 conclusion of the investigation, I was committed to a small dark cell
 with several other prisoners. During the latter part of the term,
 while awaiting my sentence, I sat in a large cell, intended for 23
 people, in which there were from 80 to 110 of us. The occupants of
 the large cells were continually changing and in view of the fact
 that 4 to 5 large cells were let out together for 15 minutes into the
 yard, I had the opportunity to become acquainted with a great many
 prisoners with hundreds of &ldquo;cases&rdquo; and the fate of
 hundreds of individuals.</P>
<P>These were the days of the mass uprisings of the peasants against
 the Stalinist collectivization, the days of mass executions
 throughout the whole of Russia, the days of the famous execution of
 the &ldquo;Forty-Five&rsquo;&rsquo; so-called wreckers. During this
 time prisoners in our jail were taken out almost daily to face the
 firing squad. Except in rare instances, the press carried no news
 about these executions. But once I witnessed the following case. The
 morning papers, which had been just brought in, contained a dispatch
 that the death sentence of so-and-so had been &ldquo;carried out.&rdquo;
 But this man was still alive, sitting, entirely unaware, among us in
 the cell. The entire cell, the whole tier fell into a frenzy, into
 horror ... but a few minutes later this oversight was &ldquo;corrected,&rdquo;
 and the man led from the cell to face the firing squad ...</P>
<P>I also became acquainted here with the methods by which certain
 trials of wreckers were prepared and organized. One of the men who
 &ldquo;confessed&rdquo; spoke to me as follows:</P>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;They kept me in solitary confinement for five
 months, without newspapers, without tobacco, without my being allowed
 to receive packages (of food and clothing) or to see my family. I was
 starved and tortured by loneliness. They kept demanding that I
 confess myself guilty of acts of wrecking that never took place; I
 refused to assume responsibility for crimes I never committed &ndash;
 I was afraid of the consequences of such grave self-accusations, but
 the prosecutor kept assuring me that if I was really for the Soviet
 power, as I said I was, then I must prove it by deeds: the Soviet
 power was in need of my confessions, and therefore I must give them.
 I need not be afraid of the consequences because the Soviet power
 would take my unreserved confessions into account, and give me an
 opportunity to work (he was an engineer), and enable me to expiate my
 sins through work. I would immediately be permitted to receive visits
 from my family, obtain newspapers and packages, and go out for walks.
 But if I persisted in remaining stubborn and kept mum, I would be
 treated ruthlessly and not only find myself subjected to repressions
 but my wife and children would be persecuted as well ... For months I
 refused to capitulate, but then things became so hard, I was so
 lonely that it seemed to me that the future could hold nothing worse
 in store. In any case, I became indifferent to everything. Then I
 proceeded to sign everything the prosecutor demanded.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fst">The consequences? He was immediately permitted to receive
 newspapers, visits, books, packages, and was transferred to a common
 cell. The G.P.U. kept its promise. His lot was improved by his false
 self-accusations (and his accusations of others, although he made no
 mention of them directly to me). But why does the G.P.U. insist upon
 forcing such false testimony? Obviously in order to shift the
 responsibility for the difficulties and failures in the fulfillment
 of the Five Year Pan from the Government onto the shoulders of the
 engineers &ndash; that is the answer. In this jail I later ran across
 many similar cases.</P>
<P>In the Leningrad prison I was also treated to the spectacle of
 people compelled to spend the entire day standing in the corridor
 before the doors of the prosecutor&rsquo;s office &ndash; without
 food or sleep &ndash; or, subjected to 16&ndash;24 hours&rsquo; grilling in
 order to force from them &ldquo;confessions&rdquo; wanted by the
 G.P.U.</P>
<P>There is no sense in deluding oneself that these inquisitorial
 tortures are, if you please, applied only to the representatives of
 the former ruling classes, or to the bourgeois intelligentsia, and
 the middle classes. No. They are applied to workers. I saw a sailor
 who, on being led out from the cell, was several times told that he
 was going to face the firing squad. He was led out into the yard, and
 then brought back to the cell.</P>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;After all, you are a worker. We don&rsquo;t want
 to shoot you down like a White Guard. As a worker you should make a
 clean breast of it ...&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fst">The sailor persisted in refusing to confess. But as a result of
 these tortures he went half-mad. Then he was left in peace. They
 insisted that he confess his fictitious participation in a fictitious
 plot against Stalin. This happened not after the Kirov affair in
 1934, but long before, in the year 1930.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Persecution of Chinese</H4>
<p class="fst">All that I witnessed in the Leningrad prison came as a frightful
 blow to me. Until then I had the highest regard for the G.P.U. This
 was another one of the phases which demonstrated to me that the
 degeneration of the once revolutionary power had gone much further
 than I had presumed. I immediately protested to the prosecutor
 against these horrors, tortures, false accusations, and
 &ldquo;confessions.&rsquo;&rsquo;</P>
<P>Upon the conclusion of the investigation of my case, I sent a
 letter to the collegium of the G.P.U. and the C.E.C. of the U.S.S.R.,
 demanding that I be permitted to depart abroad. My communication was
 left unanswered. There was no need to treat us with ceremony, for we
 were only representatives of a small Balkan people. Together with my
 Yugoslav comrade Deditch, I was shipped off to the political prison
 in the Urals. The question of my returning home was postponed
 indefinitely. As I found out later, the treatment accorded us was
 quite &ldquo;respectable.&rdquo; After all, I was a European, a man,
 as Hitler would say, belonging to the white race.</P>
<P><I>But so far as Chinese and all other &ldquo;Asiatics&rdquo; are
 concerned, the present Soviet rulers deal with them much more
 unceremoniously: they are generally not recognized as political
 prisoners. Thus, for instance, the students, the Communist
 Oppositionists of the former Chinese University of Sun Yat Sen in
 Moscow were either shipped to the worst exile areas and into
 concentration camps where only criminals were sent, or they were
 simply handed over for extermination to Chiang Kai-shek (they were
 placed on board of a ship which goes from Vladivostok to Shanghai).</I></P>
<P>Comrade Deditch and myself were removed from Leningrad in the
 middle of October. True to its methods, the G.P.U. did not tell us
 where we were being taken. Only in Chelyabinsk did we learn that our
 destination was Verkhne-Uralsk. We arrived there on the evening of
 November 7. Throughout the day, from our car windows, we could
 observe the October parades, the celebrations in the cities of
 Troitsk, Magnitogorsk, and other places through which we passed.
 Everywhere against the sky rose the foundations, walls and chimneys
 of factories, power plants and industrial giants in process of
 construction. A new America, cruel and mighty sprouting over
 one-sixth of the terrestrial globe ...</P>
<P>The three of us, all Yugoslavs (comrade Draguitch was brought
 there three months later) spent 2&frac12; years (until May 1933) in
 the Verkhne-Uralsk political prison &ndash; (a political isolator, in
 Russian terminology). This prison is an old military jail, a
 structure three stories high on the steppes of the Ural Cossacks. The
 bottom story of the prison is very cold. One has to wear overshoes
 and sheepskin throughout the entire winter, sitting in the cells of
 the first tier. The inside window panes become covered during the
 night with a thick sheet of ice.</P>
 <P>The food is the traditional fare of the poor Russian <I>mouzhik</I>:
 bread and gruel for dinner and supper, day in and day out, from year
 to year. In addition we got a tiny portion of bad fish or of canned,
 and often half-rotten meat. Conflicts broke out several times over
 the rotten meat. Once a week we were given <I>vinaigrette</I> (a
 sauce made of vinegar and oil &ndash; <I>Ed.</I>). This day was
 considered a holiday. Two times a year &ndash; on May 1 and on
 November 7 &ndash; we received a slice of white bread. But even this
 modest and monotonous fare was given us in inadequate quantities. The
 portions were slightly increased only after the 18-day hunger strike
 in 1931. The quality, unfortunately, remained unchanged.</P>
<P>When, in the beginning of 1933, we began reading in the papers
 about the workers&rsquo; delegations that were being sent to Germany
 to visit the prisoners there, we were seized with downright envy! If
 some workers&rsquo; delegation or a democratic delegation would only
 arrive from abroad to pay us a visit, to take a look at what is going
 on, and observe how we are living in the prisons, concentration
 camps, and exile! But for some reason or other, the self-same leaders
 of the foreign working class organization, and the self-same
 democratic lawyers who grow indignant at any protest against the
 terrors of Hitler Germany keep quiet and remain unconcerned about
 measures, quite similar in nature, taken against workers, peasants
 and revolutionists in Stalinist Russia.</P>
<H4>* * *</H4>
<H3>The Hunger Strikes</H3>
<p class="fst">In 1931 we went through an 18-day hunger strike in our prison. It
  passed peacefully, and most of the demands were granted. This was the
 only case of a peaceful settlement of a conflict. During the 1930
 conflict, during one of the harshest winters, in the month of
 February, the prison administration &ndash; the self-same G.P.U. &ndash;
 used the water hose, sprayed the protesting prisoners with ice water,
 broke the windows, and shut off the heat. During the conflict in
 1929, the G.P.U. went even further &ndash; after they were doused
 with water from the hose, the prisoners were bound hand and foot,
 and, in this condition, soaking wet, hog-tied, without any food, they
 were left lying on the cement floors for three days and three nights
 &ndash; &ldquo;in solitary confinement.&rdquo; Such is the juridical
 label for these abominations. In the 1934 hunger strike, which was
 held in protest against the arbitrary automatic and universal
 extension of the prison terms, the Communist Oppositionists were once
 again hog-tied and subjected to forced artificial feeding, and then,
 they were transferred either to concentration camps or to other
 prisons.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Heavy Casualties Among Prisoners</H4>
<p class="fst">Several of the imprisoned female comrades among the
 Bolshevik-Leninists, among them Lena Danilovich, slashed their veins
 in protest against this bestial treatment. The consequences of this
 regime proved catastrophic for a number of comrades. In addition to
 two grave cases of insanity &ndash; Vera Berger and Victor Krainy,
 who were transferred to an insane asylum &ndash; there was the
 serious psychical illness of Marusia Ivanova, whose name is famous
 throughout all of Siberia as the heroine of the civil war and of the
 underground struggle against Kolchak. After a long drawn out
 struggle, the G.P.U. agreed to free her from jail but refused to let
 her go to her relatives, sending her instead into exile. One of the
 prisoners, Andrey Grayev, became stone-blind in the prison after the
 brutal acts of the G.P.U. in February 1930.</P>
<P>The imprisoned Communists lived in their cells and took their
 walks in the prison yard in groups (3&ndash;5 cells together, 25&ndash;30
 people); they composed the &ldquo;communist sector&rdquo; (all told,
 140&ndash;180). The Socialists of all parties (Russian and Georgian
 social democrats, Zionists and left S.R.s), the anarchists and
 individuals from the Right S.R.s and the Maximalists were placed in
 different cells and composed another, an anarchist-socialist section
 (50&ndash;80 people, approximately ten to each of the above mentioned
 organizations).</P>
<P>Each sector had its own &ldquo;household&rdquo; economic
 organization, headed by an Elder and a &ldquo;Minister of Finance.&rdquo;
 Each collective was represented by the elder in dealings with the
 prison administration, while the &ldquo;Minister of Finance&rdquo;
 had charge of the treasury of the sector. In the event of struggles
 with the administration, both sectors harmonized their actions,
 supporting each other in this or that form, but otherwise the
 relations between the two sectors, even as regards the day to day
 routine, were rigidly differentiated. The illegal post office was
 organized jointly.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Political Life</H4>
<p class="fst">In the political domain the Communist sector was divided into a
 number of groups and shadings, almost each of them with its own
 separate organization, its own committees, its own publications. The
 Five Year Plan shook up the entire 170 million population of Russia.
 The Plan represented a real technological, and, in part, an economic
 revolution (or, at any rate, as could be sensed even back in 1930, an
 attempt at such a revolution). The social and political problems
 which the Five Year Plan posed before all thinking people could not
 fail to arouse in the prison a profound ferment, new seekings, and.
 in part, a crisis in old ideologies. The intense and more or less
 fruitful search for answers to new questions was accompanied by an
 inevitable sharp internal struggle.</P>
<P>In 1933&ndash;1935 the situation in the country had become more
 clarified, the theoretical questions had assumed a more distinct and
 integrated form, and, on this basis, there occurred a new
 crystallization of the prisoners into several basic political groups,
 among them the unification of all the Bolshevik-Leninists into a
 single organization. I, too, took the liveliest part in the struggle
 of groups and ideas, in the search for the theoretical definition of
 all that was taking place at that time, and everything that had
 occurred during the entire 16 years of the revolution, and in the
 search for the definitions of the lessons of the Russian Revolution
 and the new revolutionary tasks. The large numerical strength of the
 Verkhne-Uralsk collective of the political prisoners, the presence
 there of qualified representatives of all tendencies and shadings of
 revolutionary thought in Russia for the last 20 years helped greatly
 to facilitate the attainment of definite results.</P>
<P>Under conditions that doomed the entire country to silence, or,
 rather, to subservience and compelled men to repeat parrot-like an
 obviously false official ideology, the large and internally cohesive
 jail was transformed into a laboratory of ideas. The prison became
 the only place for free sociological research. I attempted to make
 fundamental use of my compulsory presence in this prison, this tiny
 island of liberty.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Ciliga&rsquo;s Prison Conclusions</H4>
<p class="fst">I was of the opinion that aims and results justify sufferings and
 victims. As a consequence, I arrived to the views of the so-called
 ultra-Lefts. I became convinced that the fundamental and decisive
 breaking point in the Russian Revolution occurred in 1920&ndash;1921,
 when the initial steps of the workers towards gaining control of
 production came to an unsuccessful conclusion, and when, as a result,
 the bureaucratic state-capitalist organization of industrial
 production triumphed, being subsequently correlated under the N.E.P.
 with concessions to private capitalist elements in agriculture and
 trade. These concessions were liquidated, by and large, during the
 period of the Five Year Plan, after which there was established in
 Russia the system of far-flung bureaucratic state-capitalism in the
 domain of economy, supported by a regime of Bonapartism in the sphere
 of politics.</P>
<P>Because of these views I left the &ldquo;collective of the left
 Bolshevik-Leninists,&rdquo; and became one of the initiators of the
 unification of the so-called ultra-Left groupings. This unification
 took place only after my departure from Verkhne-Uralsk. &ldquo;The
 Federation of left Communists&rdquo; (consisting of extreme left
 Bolshevik-Leninists. a section of the D.C.ers. Workers&rsquo;
 Opposition, followers of Myasnikov) was organized there. This
 Federation numbered 25 people. The re-united organization of the
 Bolshevik-Leninists consisted of 140. A section of the D.C.ers and
 &ldquo;independents&rdquo; remained outside both these united groups.</P>
