<hr>

<p class="fst">Herman Gorter died at Brussels, on September 15, 1927. He had
gone to Switzerland from his home in Holland to renew his health, but he felt
that the end of his life was near, and so he broke off his stay in Switzerland
and tried to return home. But he was obliged to break his journey at Brussels,
and he died the same night in the hotel. His dying was as brave and true as his
living. He had death before his eyes ten hours before he died. And he spent the
time arranging about his unpublished writings and issuing strict instructions
that nobody should speak that his grave.</p>

<p class="fst">When the world war broke out, and so called "socialist" movement
put itself in every country under the command and at the disposal of the
national bourgeoisie, Herman Gorter did not fall. He impeached all the
"theoreticians" who surrendered the proletariat to the capitalist class, and
analysed the causes of the collapse of the socialist movement, in his work,
<cite>Imperialism, Social Democracy, and World War</cite>.</p>

<p class="fst">Herman Gorter was a son of a famous Dutch litterateur. He was
born on November 26, 1864. He was keen student of the classics and became a
teacher of Greek and Latin at the gymnasium. He astonished the literary world
by his poem <cite>May</cite>. It is a poem devoted to the worship of nature in
a language never heard before. He broke with tradition and established rules
and expressed the feelings as they were actually felt. In other words, he
placed poetry on the basis of truth. A storm of enthusiasm shock than literary
world and the poem was acknowledged to be the finest and best of that kind.
Gorter gathered about him a group of young poets and developed the literary
revolution known as "the movement of the Eighties". This was in 1880.</p>

<p class="fst">But Gorter soon perceived that this movement did not go very
far. It affected nothing. It lacked depth. He sought for the cause and studied
anew the ancient culture of Greece and Egypt to understand the reason of their
powerful development. The result was expressed in an essay: <cite>Critique of
the movement of the Eighties</cite>.</p>

<p class="fst">He studied philosophy, translated the <cite>Ethics</cite> of
Spinoza, and revelled in Kant. Then he read <cite>Das Capital</cite>. In Marx
he found what he wanted. He studied profoundly the writings of Marx and
Engels.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1890, Gorter joined the social Democratic Labour Party,
S.D.A.P., in Holland. At first this party rejoiced in his membership. But he
was too capable and too clever to please his party for long. He rapidly emerged
as one of the greatest theoreticians on Communism and Marxism in Europe, and
one of the most powerful speakers in Holland. <cite>Het Volk</cite>, the social
democratic organ, complained that socialism was, to him, a fine dream, a holy
unseizable ideal. It admitted he was a clear and convincing speaker, but added
that he disrupted the party. Which means that he opposed socialism to the
political corruption of social democracy, to careerism, to the struggle for
possession of the highest places in the capitalist state. To the "socialist"
parliamentarians there was nothing holy or unseizable. In the name of trade
unionism and Social Democracy they were willing to become the murderers of the
masses.</p>

<p class="fst">The tendency to smooth down the class struggle, the tendency to
reformism, became more marked in the S.D.A.P. Armed with the critical weapon of
Marxism, with the understanding given by historical materialism, Gorter exposed
the capitalistic compromises and treacheries of the S.D.A.P. The fight became
sharp and vigorous, and a powerful Marxian Group was formed within the S.D.A.P.
Most of this group was expelled in 1909 and formed a Marxian Party under the
title of the Social Democratic party (S.D.P.). Gorter joined the S.D.P.</p>

<p class="fst">That year the S.D.P. issued Gorter's work, <cite>Marxism and
Revisionism</cite>. This work exposed the antisocialist character of all
revisionist activity. Down to the outbreak of the world war, the S.D.P. did
good work by its clear analysis of capitalist society. Then a change came. The
leaders, Wijnkoop and Ravensteijn, were be elected to Parliament and
immediately turned to opportunism. The syndicalist labourers of Holland, as an
organised body, were opposed to "Prussianism" and inclined to sympathy with
"Allied" imperialism. So Wijnkoop. and V. Ravensteijn, who wanted the
syndicalist workers' votes at the ballot box, upheld the "Allied cause" in
Parliament. This caused Gorter, who would not desert the irreconcilable class
struggle to publish his work, <cite>Imperialism, Social Democracy and World
War.</cite> Gorter showed that it made no difference to the workers which of
the Imperialist alliances won the war. For the workers in all lands the issues
remained the same. All Imperialism had to be fought and destroyed. But
Imperialism was not destroyed by capitalist wars. There was only one way in
which the workers could destroy Imperialism: that was the way of World
revolution. The workers had to oppose Socialism to war.</p>

<p class="fst">The Russian Revolution of October, 1917, found in Gorter an
enthusiastic defender. But he was too sound a Marxian student not to see the
double character of that revolution. To triumph, the revolution had to be a
world revolution. Otherwise, it must retreat and cease to be. All forces,
therefore, ought to have been released to bring the world revolution
nearer.</p>

<p class="fst">With his friend, Anton Pannekoek, another much neglected famous
Dutch Marxian student, Gorter analysed the Russian Revolution in terms of
historical materialism. They show how this revolution was in part, a
proletarian, and in part, a farmer, that is, a capitalist revolution. For the
farmers desired smallholding and private possession and division of the land.
Against 10 million workers, inclined to Socialist understanding, there were
over 100 million farmers, with capitalistic ideology. If the world revolution
of the proletariat came to help, these ten millions would become part of the
mighty proletariat that had conquered and emancipated the world. But if the
world revolution did not come to help, then it was determined by the class
conditions existing in Russia that a new capitalist period would set in. And
the consequence would be that Russia would change from being the centre of
world revolution, into a powerful ally of world capitalism, allied to other
capitalist states, in enmity to the working class struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">Gorter travelled in 1921, illegally, to the Third Congress of
the Third International, to defend this viewpoint, as a delegate of the
K.A.P.D. Lenin had chosen already for the retreat to capitalism. He had
published his work on <cite>The Infantile Sickness of the Left Wing</cite>. And
at the Congress the revolutionary proletarians, who would put an end to
capitalism, were expelled from the Third International, and a bridge to
capitalist politics was found in this slogan of <em>The United Front</em>.</p>

<p class="fst">Gorter sharply replied to Lenin's <cite>Infantile
Sickness</cite> in the small brochure, entitled <cite>Open Letter to Comrade
Lenin</cite>. In a masterly demonstration, he showed how Lenin's tactic must
break down the Russian Revolution of October 1917; must collapse the world
struggle towards socialism; and must entail the irreparable arrestment of the
world revolution. Leninism would prolong the struggle and increase the cost in
suffering and hardship to the workers.</p>

<p class="fst">Gorter showed that Lenin liquidated Communism not only as an
expression of existence in Russia, but as a propaganda of the Communist Party.
He developed tactics of the <em>Left Wing</em>, that is, of
anti-Parliamentarism, against the capitalistic methods of Lenin, the retreat to
world-wide parliamentarianism and trade unionism, dictatorship <em>over</em>
the proletariat, and the gradual reduction and elimination of the Communist
Party is in every land to "legal" parties.</p>

<p class="fst">Gorter outlined the historic materialistic foundation of the
Left Wing or anti-Parliamentarian tactics. He declared that the tactics of
placing the shop committee in the centre of all class movement was not
"'discovered' or 'invented' by the theoreticians." Every period of the
class-struggle has its own laws, according to which the rank-and-file develops
its own forces. The workers discovered that in those countries where they had
made parliamentarianism and trade unionism possible, the organisation they had
built and developed opposed <em>every</em> proletarian action. So the shop
committee became the form in which the proletarian psychic energy found its
vent. <em>Left-wing tactics were evolved by the proletarian
themselves</em>.</p>

<p class="fst">Gorter analysed the causes of this behaviour of the
revolutionary proletariat, and explained, in his "Open Letter," that it was not
an accidental deviation, but the inevitable expression of the
class-struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">Gorter thought that Lenin did not understand western capitalism,
and, therefore, erred in the tactics he urged on the workers of Western Europe.
It is useless to speculate on this point to-day, when western civilisation is
in chaos, and the East is ruined with the war. First, Second, and Third
Internationals have passed. The Fourth does not exist, and Anarchism has
failed in France and Holland.</p>

<p class="fst">Gorter and Pannekoek developed the theoretical statement of the
<em>Left Wing</em>. They declared that the proletarian is the only power for
revolution, and must grow in class consciousness and power consciousness.
Parliamentarism must be destroyed as the safety-valve of class society,
intended to divert proletarian activities, and the trade unions must be
repudiated, as parliamentarism on the industrial field, a ramification of
parliamentarism. The <em>Left Wing</em> would not accept the 21 points, and was
expelled from the Third International. But Gorter viewed the breaking down of
the Third International as inevitable, and saw Communism before him, reviving
and conquering at last, after the disasters caused by the Russian retreat.</p>

<p class="fst">When Gorter became a Socialist he issued a book of poems, which
no longer had nature for the theme, but class struggle. As he says in one of
his poems, he "had found something much greater than Nature." He next worked at
a great poem of 500 pages, called <cite>Pan</cite>. He spent nine years, from
1907 to 1916, writing it. This work traces the history of the labour movement.
In it, he sees the factory as a wonderful thing, the condensation of the spirit
of mankind, the growth of generations, the parent of revolution and
commonweal.</p>

<p class="fst">In the unpublished works of Gorter, there is one poem, <cite>Der
Arbeidarraad</cite> <span class="inote">[The Soviet Committee]</span>. Gorter
pictures the shop committee the centre of revolution, bringing Communism into
being. He wrote this poem with all his love for his class, the workers. But the
ruling class of today, the world of bogus culture, can never understand how a
great poem can centre around the theme of a Soviet Committee.</p>
