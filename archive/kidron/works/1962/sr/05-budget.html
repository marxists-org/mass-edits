<h1>Budget Tricks</h1>

<h3>(May 1962)</h3>

<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Review</strong>, [<a href="../../../../../history/etol/newspape/soc-rev-srg/index.html#sr62_05" target="new">12th Year No.&nbsp;5</a>,] May 1962, p.&nbsp;5.<br />

<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">So much of Government&#8217;s expenditure is earmarked years in
advance that the budget can&#8217;t effect major changes, economically
speaking, from year to year. Of the total outlay last year, just
under one-quarter went on an inflexible arms budget, another eighth
on interest charges (mainly payment for past wars), another sixth or
more on long loans to nationalized industries, private firms and so
on, and under one-half on all the rest of civil administration. Even
here there is little room to manoeuvre: civil service pay, provision
for education, national assistance, national health, roads and the
rest are pretty well inflexible and determine very closely what the
Government is going to take in taxes.</p>

<p>In other words, there is litle interest in the budgetary &#8216;what&#8217;.
The totals are well known in advance. What might be interesting is
the &#8216;who&#8217;. Who is made to cough up when the Chancellor stretches
out his hand &#8216;ready to receive&#8217; like the judge in the <em>Caucasian
Chalk Circle</em>? Even here the budget usually holds few surprises.
The Tories don&#8217;t need the long Thursday afternoon rigmarole to
shift the load from their class to ours: the Rent Act which
transferred &#163;100 million per year from tenants to landlords was not
a budgetary measure, nor was the pay pause, nor the increase in Bank
Rate nor any of the other steps which squeezed part of the pay packet
into the pig-skin wallet. Not that the budget is neutral: reducing
purchase tax on luxuries and raising it on furniture as in the last
one is not a random choice. Still, it&#8217;s to be expected from the Tories ...</p>

<p>What is highly interesting though, is the use of budget day as a
pivot in Tory election strategy. Two things are important here. Tory
success at the polls is entirely dependent on their being able to
suffuse a &#8216;we&#8217;re all middle class now, and prospering&#8217; fog
amongst workers. Since next year is election year and the stock
market has recently been the scene of rich and publicized killings,
the Chancellor thought it <em>politic</em> to reinforce the &#8216;equality
of treatment&#8217; strand in Tory policy. Hence his &#8216;capital gains
tax&#8217; which, as the <strong>Economist</strong> points out &#8216;is an optional
tax, easily and legally avoided, and for some easily and illegally evaded&#8217;.</p>

<p>But who cares? The Tories aren&#8217;t interested in the money, but in
purveying a feeling of equity; not in taxing their class, but in
letting ours know that we&#8217;re not the only ones to be docked. The
Chancellor explained his case lucidly:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>While the main junction of any system of taxation must
be to bring in revenue, it must also be designed to produce a feeling
of broad equity of treatment between taxpayers. At present, it is
pretty widely felt to be inequitable that those who supplement their
incomes by speculative gains should escape tax on those gains. I do
not think that they should continue to do so; and I tell the
Committee frankly that it is on this account and not mainly for the
yield, that I put forward this proposal.</em></p>

<p class="fst">The second electioneering aspect of Lloyd&#8217;s budget lies in its
drabness. Little was given, little taken away this time. But next
time, April 1963, what an orgy of tax concessions there&#8217;ll be! The
promised abolition of Schedule A (a tax on mainly middle-class
owner-occupiers) and the raising of the surtax floor will conjoin
bountifully to save the middle class from Liberalism. A possible
penny off beer will, it is hoped, send workers reeling to the polls
holding Tory tickets. And the normal Tory barn dance will be stomped
through: April budget (expansive) &#8211; Spring election (Tory victory)
&#8211; Autumn budget (cruel and deflationary).</p>

<p>The Tories have served notice of their intentions. What the Labour
leadership is doing about it is a mystery. Not the faintest &#8216;peep&#8217;
to contradict the &#8216;one class, one nation&#8217; humbug; and not the
shadow of a policy to fight the next election on &#8211; or are they
waiting for the Liberals to helm them to their seats?</p>
