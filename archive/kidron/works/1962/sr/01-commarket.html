<p class="fst">IT is understandable that the labour movement in this country is
split in many different directions on Britain&#8217;s application to join
the Common Market. It is a major issue and the repercussions of
whatever move the Tories make will be felt for many years. Under the
circumstances one could expect the debate to be both serious and informed.</p>

<p>But no. The Common Marketers &#8211; Crosland, Roy Jenkins, Charles
Pannell and the rest &#8211; are content to peddle cartel-Europe in the
same terms and tones as are heard around boardroom tables, while the
Anti&#8217;s &#8211; and here one is dealing with the established Left of the
movement &#8211; have laboured to produce a motley of arguments which,
were they not such a tragic indication of their poverty in ideas,
would be very funny.</p>

<p>... There&#8217;s no need to reproduce the arguments of the Marketeers
here. They can be seen daily in the <strong>Times</strong>, <strong>Telegraph</strong>,
<strong>Economist</strong> and other such organs of &#8216;enlightened&#8217; big
business. The &#8216;Left&#8217; is less, well serviced, and so claims more attention.</p>

<p>Their first argument concerns the Commonwealth and Britain&#8217;s
unique role in world affairs. &#8216;The danger for Britain of
&#8220;integration&#8221; into the common political institutions envisaged by
the Treaty of Rome are clear&#8217; writes <strong>Trade Union Affairs</strong>,
new-look journal of the &#8216;enlightened&#8217; trade union bureaucracy
(Spring 1961, p.&nbsp;104). &#8216;From the day of her entry there would
be a corresponding erosion of Commonwealth organs and a diminishing
of her special role in the world, which has been quite exceptional
for a nation of only 52 million people unbacked by natural wealth.&#8217;
<strong>Tribune</strong> echoes: to join &#8216;would be to turn our backs on the
Commonwealth, to abdicate our independent role in world affairs ...&#8217;</p>

<p>A nice thought this. Indeed, Britain <em>has</em> a special,
independent role in world affairs. No other power has played
claphandies with Sir Roy so single-mindedly as Britain in the Congo.
Who but Britain could have led the Suez invasion six years ago? As
for the Commonwealth, a true example of non-racialist (except of
course for Australia and Britain) brotherhood it is. Within it
capital is capital, guns guns and strikers against the one are shot
down by the other as on the British tea estates in Assam.</p>

<p>Moving on, the Left has discovered the virtues of the virgin EFTA
(European Free Trade Association) conjured up by Britain to use as a
bargaining counter with the Common Market. Barrett-Brown and Hughes
have shown in their New Left Pamphlet, <strong>Britain&#8217;s Crisis and the
Common Market</strong>, that &#8216;EFTA is fundamentally a neutralistic
bloc&#8217;! Shame on MacMillan and Salazar for dragging us out of NATO
without telling anyone! Will they never get rid of their predilection
for secret diplomacy?</p>

<p>Then there is the danger to socialist planning. <strong>New Left
Review</strong>: &#8216;The contradictions for a government trying to steer a
socialist economy in tight reign with six capitalist countries,
working in close harmony would be immense.&#8217; (July&#8211;August, 1961,
pp.&nbsp;9&#8211;10). So too <strong>Trade Union Affairs</strong>: &#8216;a future
Labour Government might find progressive policies outlined in an
election manifesto were impossible of implementation due to the
economic and political planning core of the Six.&#8217; (Spring 1961, p.&nbsp;105).</p>

<p>Observe the image of Gaitskell steering Britain&#8217;s &#8216;socialist
economy&#8217; between the rocks of capitalist Europe, in which, by the
way, holidays and holiday pay are better than here (in Germany, Italy
and France), pensions more generous (Germany), maternity benefits
higher (France) and equal pay for women the rule (France).</p>

<p>&#8216;I have no wish&#8217;, says Anthony Greenwood, MP, an important
anti-Marketeer on the left of the Parliamentary Labour Party, &#8216;to
transfer political power from the British man in the street to Dr.
Adenauer and President de Gaulle ...&#8217; (<strong>Daily Worker</strong>, 10 June
1961). Blessed be the sentiment, but which man in which street is
dear Anthony talking about? Selwyn Lloyd in Downing Street?</p>

<p>Finally, it takes the Communist Party to appeal to the very
basest, parochial and cowardly defensive instincts in the movement.
&#8216;If the free movement of labour were established large numbers of
unemployed Italian workers might come to Britain.&#8217; (Labour Research
Department, <strong>Questions and Answers on the Common Market</strong>,
p.&nbsp;18). If it were true, so what? Surely the labour movement is
powerful enough to extend trade union protection to <em>all</em> new
workers? But it isn&#8217;t even true, otherwise German capital wouldn&#8217;t
be combing countries outside the Common Market &#8211; Greece and Spain &#8211;
for workers, nor would Italian industry be stalking the Ruhr to lure
Italian immigrant workers back to their home country.</p>

<p>Not all the arguments are so specious, however. <strong>Trade Union
Affairs</strong> is right to say that &#8216;we might well find ourselves
committed to a sadly unequal struggle with entrenched monopolistic
concerns able to insure themselves against pressures or defeat by the
international nature of their operations&#8217; (Spring 1961, pp.&nbsp;104&#8211;5),
and that &#8216;the British trade unions need overhaul, better
structures, more specialists: they would be lost in the Common
Market&#8216;. (Summer 1961, p.&nbsp;5) But surely this is an argument
for getting on with the job of adapting the structure of our unions
and for linking up internationally?</p>

<p>Within capitalism there seems no escape from cartel Europe. Nor is
the decision ours. If it were, we would be on the brink of socialist
revolution and looking ourselves for support from Europe&#8217;s workers.
But it isn&#8217;t, and so long as this is the case, instead of crying
&#8216;Commonwealth&#8217;, &#8216;EFTA&#8217;, &#8216;Planning&#8217; etc. with the
established Left, it is our duty to warn the labour movement of the
upheavals that are bound to occur as we edge towards the Continent,
to fight for the best conditions obtaining anywhere within the Common
Market (British National Health Service, German pensions, French
equal pay and so on), to link up with the European labour movement
and to help inscribe on the program of a united European labour
movement &#8211; no Cartel Market but the United States of Socialist Europe!</p>
