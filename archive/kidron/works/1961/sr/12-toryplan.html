<p class="fst">It is futile to suggest &#8211; as is often done in the labour
movement &#8211; that the Tories are incapable of some form of national
planning, or that capitalism must necessarily buck or block it. The
massive concentration of capital inherent in the system, which allows
100 top firms to receive one-third of all profits in industry; the
growth in economic importance of the state which now takes one-third
of gross national product in taxes; the complete interdependence of
the state and private economies, particularly, but not only, in the
war industries; the shortage of labour resulting from the
arms-sustained boom, have already imposed a rudimentary form of planning.</p>

<p>This finds expression as much in concrete projects, such as the
Iron and Steel Federation&#8217;s <em>Plan for Steel</em> or the Transport
Commission&#8217;s ten year modernization plan for British Railways, as
in the shift of economic studies from micro-economics (price, the
firm, marginalism, consumer studies) to macro-economics (national
income analysis and the battery of concepts known, loosely, as Keynesianism).</p>

<p>As capitalist Britain edges towards cartel-Europe the pressures
for planning the necessary adjustments &#8211; killing off some
industries, fattening others, shifting the direction of trade,
linking Britain and European capital, coordinating legal systems, and
so on are becoming greater. Selwyn Lloyd&#8217;s National Economic
Development Council is only one straw in the wind. There will be
more, and it is for the labour movement to clarify its attitude
towards them. One thing must be clear from the start. Whatever the
form capitalist planning takes it can never be more then a very
primitive, partial and highly irrational affair. There are a number
of reasons for this.</p>

<p>Capitalism can exist only if there is a strictly-defined function
for the ruling class to exercise, namely the control over investment.
This is not to say that the class as a whole takes common decisions
on the matter. On the contrary, except in time of war or other major
crises investment is presided over in an uncoordinated way by
different sections of the class dispersed throughout the economy. The
only way they have of telling what investment policy they should
adopt &#8211; whether more or less, in this form of production or that &#8211;
is generally [?] by reference to actual and ?????al competition
amongst themselves. Competition &#8211; the &#8216;anarchy of the market in
Marx&#8217;s phrase &#8211; and the ???ersal [the ??? are covered by the
remains of a 2 #189;d stamp! &#8211; <em>RK</em>] of investment decisions
that implies are vital to the system, so vital as to make full
capitalist planning a contradiction in terms.</p>

<p>But not all planning is ruled out of court. The more severe the
competition the greater the need for concentrating capital into
larger (and fewer) units in order to compete, the easier it becomes
to coordinate between the units as against an alliance of competitors
elsewhere and the more does this coordination appear necessary to the
hitherto warring segments within each national or even supra-national
sphere. The process is fraught with complexities. No one will deny
the ferocity of military and economic competition between East and
West. Yet a glance at the strenuous bargaining between British and
Franco-German capital about the conditions of the former&#8217;s entry
into cartel-Europe is enough to realize how difficult it is to attain
even minimum collaboration between different centres of capital and
that under maximum pressure. And what goes on a European scale goes
within each national unit.</p>

<p>There is another, ultimately more important limitation on
capitalist planning. For capital, labour is a factor of production;
no more, no less. It has to be planned for like any other. But
workers are more than hands, as capital finds out to its annoyance in
its day to day activities. In much the same way as planning is
constantly upset because relations <em>between</em> centres of capital
cannot be planned within the system, so relations between capital and
labour are fundamentally unstable and resist a rigid mould.</p>

<p>Not that capital does not give it a good try. &#8216;Profit sharing&#8217;,
tame union bosses, the encouragement of class collaborationist ideas
(&#8216;both sides of industry must pull together&#8217;; wage pause and
dividend freeze can together &#8216;save sterling&#8217; and so on) are all
invoked to spread the illusion of common interest, common assumptions
and therefore the possibility of long-term harmony. But so long as
workers are robbed of responsibility for running industry, capital
cannot hope for lasting success. And its planning, as always occurs
when planning is divorced from mass participation and initiative
remains a bureaucratically conceived, imposed and irrational half-measure.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the labour movement needs a policy; and none need it
more than the small minority of revolutionary socialists. Very
broadly, such a policy would require to include two major elements.</p>

<p>First, we cannot reject planning. To do so would be to deny one
characteristic &#8211; a major one at that &#8211; of a contemporary system
which enjoys the acquiescence of an overwhelming majority of the
working class. As the system becomes more closely administered, it is
up to the labour movement&#8217;s organizations to transfer their
reformist activities to that administration and pay less
single-minded attention to dying parliamentary institutions. The
change from exclusive involvement in such institutions, which in any
case are becoming steadily less meaningful in gaining improvements
for workers within the system, to involvement in those which count
might even save the reformist soul of our mass organizations from
withering away utterly. Whatever the case, if the prime function of
the trade unions and Labour Party is to get &#8216;more&#8217;, let them ask
for it and fight for it where it is most likely to be found, in the
administration, the new Development Council or wherever, and not in
the draughty void of Westminster.</p>

<p>We must advocate this shift in emphasis. But we cannot, obviously,
be satisfied with this as our only or indeed our prime role. After
all, our justification is the revolutionary potential of the working
class to effect a change in society, and our activity must be geared
to actualizing this potential. As association with capitalist
planning corrupts the reformist organizations &#8211; and it inevitably
will &#8211; our work must concentrate more and more on breaking the
ideology of class collaboration and embodying the ideas and reality
of class struggle in organizations that can never be wholly absorbed
within the new, all-embracing, administered capitalism: in
shop-stewards committees, rank-and-file movements and such like.
These are the badly-policed, imperfectly-&#8216; pacified&#8217; areas of
capital&#8217;s empire. Increasingly they should become our strongholds
as other areas of open opposition and conflict tend to be smothered
in the administrative machinery of capitalist planning.</p>
