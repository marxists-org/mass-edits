<p class="fst">THE FATE suffered by Rosa Luxemburg&#8217;s memory in the forty years
since her murder is an accurate reflection of the fate of the
international socialist movement. This mighty revolutionary, probably
the greatest tribune the western proletariat has produced since Marx
and Engels, has laid almost undisturbed in the byways of socialist
research, dimly remembered, grossly misrepresented, incapable of
being accommodated within the turgid streams of social democracy and
Stalinism. Even the miniscule groups of misnamed Trotskyists have
found her too turbulent a spirit to commit to their gallery of deities.</p>

<p>The movement has yet to discover the significance of Rosa
Luxemburg. When it does, it will be infinitely richer; until it does,
it will be underlining its failure to measure up to its historic tasks.</p>

<p>Rosa Luxemburg has had her biographers. Paul Fr√∂lich&#8217;s work is
a classic of sympathetic writing. But until now, no one has attempted
a critical appraisal of her life and work from the point of view of
Western socialists, that is, in terms of the current tasks of the
developed proletarian mass movement. No one has yet appealed to
Luxemburg for guidance in present-day political activity.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>New men old problem</h4>

<p class="fst">This, Tony Cliff has now done in his critique of Rosa Luxemburg,
published as nos.&nbsp;2 and 3 of <strong>International Socialism</strong>. His
method is to fasten on to the major problems facing the West European
labour movement at the turn of last century by describing their
formulation in Rosa Luxemburg&#8217;s work, and then to present her
conclusions and solutions in a spirit of criticism and objective
evaluation. This is creative writing. The reader sees the subject in
historical perspective. Her magnificent achievements placed in
context, her equally magnificent mistakes sharply exposed.</p>

<p>Sometimes the logic of ideas leads the author to ignore, his
subject, completely imputing to her a train of thought more his
merely serve to underline the major lesson of the book: that there is
an amazingly strong similarity between the problems that faced our
grandfathers and those confronting us; that the searing revolutionary
energy and clairvoyance that enabled Rosa Luxemburg to cleave to the
very heart of their solution have made her the greatest teacher of
our time, a never-ending source of inspiration to the isolated
revolutionary socialist minorities of today.</p>

<p>Where we have a Strachey, Luxemburg&#8217;s generation had a
Bernstein. Both ex-Marxists, both projecting a brief capitalist
prosperity into the limitless future; both ascribing a regulatory,
&#8220;democratic&#8221; role to trade unions which, in the long run, is
bound to transmute the system gently, ever so gently, into a
socialist one; both, in a word, providing the intellectual fodder for
reformism and class collaboration.</p>

<p>Luxemburg declared relentless war on these prophets of weakness.
She exposed the analytical pretensions of Bernstein and his
followers, placed the struggle for socialism firmly on its material
base in capitalism&#8217;s inescapable economic contradictions, revealed
the limitations of trade unions as offensive weapons in the battle
for social change, attacked parliamentary fetishism, excoriated the
social-democratic politicians who accepted office in order to
disorientate and destroy independent working class action. In short,
she represented the revolutionary opposition, the hard lump of
uncompromising proletarian power within the soft, messy porage of
reformism. In her understanding of deep-rooted reformism, in the
fury, subtlety and accuracy of her campaign against it, Rosa
Luxemburg is unsurpassed in the history of socialist thought. In this
alone, she has left a testament which we have yet to read.</p>

<p>But however central to her life and thought this struggle against
capitulation within the ranks of the mass movement, it was only one
aspect. Her understanding of the awakening of mass consciousness,
gained from the experience of the mass strikes that thrust the new
from out of the old century, from Russia to Belgium, is a model of
sensitivity for, and harmony with, the tonalities of the mass
movement. It is a specific [<em>sic</em> &#8211; <em>?</em> antidote] for
both the mindless militancy and the militant mindlessness so
prevalent within it today.</p>
<p>More than anyone else she opened the eyes of socialists to the
detailed impact of imperialism on backward, pre-capitalist countries.
Nothing can be a better antidote to our neo-fabians&#8217; <strong>New
Colonial Essays</strong> than one page of her moving descriptions and
incisive analysis.</p>

<p>One of her greatest contributions, long since lost within the
grinding maws of social democracy and Stalinism, uncherished within
the lesser bureaucracies of the movement&#8217;s sects, is her passionate
defence of democracy for the working class and within it. Nothing
could stem her tirades against the machine and the machine men, the
lifeless multilimbed bureaucracy that grew on the movement in her day
and is still there. Nothing could trim her infinite belief in
working-class initiative, in consciously-conceived self-directed
working class action. Her deep understanding of the role of
leadership, the intricate interaction between leadership and led,
indeed of the physiology of the movement, led her into battle not
only against the Gaitskells of the German labour movement of her time
but also against the Lenin of the early, hunted Bolsheviks. It was
this deep-rooted and passionate defence of democracy that, more than
anything else condemned her memory to a restless homeless life in the
annals of &#8216;orthodox&#8217; socialism. Orthodoxy of any sort could never
be made to spell Luxemburg.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Great Marxist</h4>

<p class="fst">Cliff has dealt fully with these and other aspects of life and
work. He covers more than Luxemburg, the revolutionary fighter
against reformism, imperialism and bureaucracy. He analyses her views
on the national question and her criticism of the Bolsheviks in
power; he shows himself an informed critic of her major intellectual
contribution to the body of marxist thought, a sympathetic recorder
of her life and a comrade who well understands her unique place in
the movement and in history</p>

<p>There is little more that can be said is a short review such as
this. Readers can do no better than buy Cliff&#8217;s study of Rosa Luxemburg.</p>
