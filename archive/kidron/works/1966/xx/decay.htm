<p class="fst"><strong>The Crisis of India</strong><br />
Ronald Segal<br />
Jonathan Cape 42s; Penguin 5s</p>

<p class="fst">Segal is uncommonly perceptive and even more uncommonly outspoken about the cant, hypocrisy and immobility of the Indian political elite; about the rot and corruption and avoidable harshness of Indian society; the void between rulers and ruled, between plans and performance; and about the appalling poverty and degradation. Yet &#8211; &#8220;India must ...&#8221;, &#8220;India should ...&#8221; &#8211; he hasn&#8217;t escaped the admonitory mode assumed by most foreigners within minutes of arrival.</p>

<p>But then he doesn&#8217;t even begin to see the outlines of an alternative. His peasant India is still the text-book version: locked in Hinduism, cute and fiat apathy. In it there are no stirrings &#8211; for education, for urban horizons, for politics (if only caste politics), for defying old authority (if only by walking shod in the presence of Brahmins). And his working-class India doesn&#8217;t exist. On a different plane, be appears to accept Cold War and an open economy as immutable &#8211; at least the reader is not confronted wit any other view.</p>

<p>What remains is the Western-educated elite &#8211; and the lecture. To do him justice, Segal lectures them well. He does focus on some of their &#8220;areas of darkness&#8221;; he does hold stinking chunks of reality to their nostrils and demand they sniff. But the problem of India&#8217;s decay is larger than the defective sense of smelt of her middle class. And that we are not told about.</p>
