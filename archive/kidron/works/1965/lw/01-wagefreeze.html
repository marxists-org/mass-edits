<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">It&#8217;s coming. Slowly, nosing carefully, Labour&#8217;s wage freeze is
on the way. A letter of intent here, a three-year wage contract in
engineering there, fanfares, publicity, propaganda everywhere. The
Establishment &#8211; in business, in Government, and in the trade unions
&#8211; is trumpeting in harmony as never before: wage freeze is good for
you. And if it isn&#8217;t, there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it. So bow
to the inevitable. And if you can&#8217;t bow &#8211; cringe.</p>

<p>The advice has been followed in strange quarters. The old Left
around <strong>Tribune</strong> has lain so low as to be trodden into the
ground. True, they raised a little dust over the way the old-age
pensioners have been treated. There was a minor remonstrance about
Verwoerd&#8217;s Buccaneers and a warning shot about MLF. But on the
major issue, the one on which millions of workers could be roused to
organized action, not a word has been spoken.</p>

<p>The silence has not gone unexplained. Hugh Jenkins put it baldly
enough (<strong>Tribune</strong>, 11 December): &#8220;Left-wing leaders ... hold a
licence to rock because it is known that they will stop far short of
sinking the craft.&#8221; What he didn&#8217;t say &#8211; perhaps it goes
without saying &#8211; is that <em>HMS Wilson</em> will be sunk the moment
business and its Tories see that she can&#8217;t negotiate Wage Freeze.
And so the subject isn&#8217;t raised in <strong>Tribune</strong>.</p>

<p>Beyond that explanation lies another. For <strong>Tribune</strong>, politics
is what happens in Parliament and only in Parliament. What happens in
City or Zurich boardrooms, what happens on the shop floor or in the
streets are important only in so far as they affect the parliamentary
scene. In their view, defence of the parliamentary position overrides
all other considerations. So if Wilson&#8217;s Ship of State rams and
splinters every working class interest, if it pegs wages, deflates,
creates unemployment under the guise of mobility of labour, eggs on
trade-union leaders to police shop organisations, goes slow on
housing, to name a few, it must still be supported until the majority improves.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a sad decline. That weekly once justified the name <strong>Tribune</strong>,
meaning champion of the people. Now it might as well be renamed <strong>The
Weekly Whisper</strong>.</p>

<p>As for me, I would hate to see the Government topple meaninglessly
or because business becomes restive. But if it falls because workers
organize against wage-freeze and refuse the business-backed policies
Labour is handing out, I should welcome it. What is lost in
Parliament will be gained a millionfold in working class
consciousness and strength.</p>
