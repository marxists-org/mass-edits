<p class="fst">Brown&#8217;s White Paper on incomes shows a government, aching to
displace bargaining in the market with wages by decree. As the <strong>Times</strong>
summarized it, &#8220;wages and salaries ... are determined by many
factors, including changes in supply and demand for different kinds
of labour, productivity trends, profit trends, comparison with other
industries and changes in the cost of living. But less weight will
have to be given to these factors and more to the incomes norm.&#8221; (9 April)</p>

<p>So far organized labour hasn&#8217;t taken much notice of the
Government&#8217;s aches. The market continues to echo to the
auctioneering of hours, rates, bonuses; we still see quarrels and
occasional fights. But Brown&#8217;s bouncers are closing in and the
free-for-all is due for a battering. After all, if wages can be
restrained by only one per cent for as little as twelve months, it
could lead to an increase of as much as one-third in resources for
investment. The economic stakes are high.</p>

<p>The socialist stakes are even higher. To win on wages, workers
will need to wallop not only their individual managements but Brown&#8217;s
&#8220;norm&#8221; and his trade-union bouncers as well. That means politics.</p>

<p>Take another issue, political from its inception &#8211; Vietnam. Even
the <strong>Times</strong>&#8217; Own Correspondent has shown increasing
embarrassment at Wilson&#8217;s spreadeagled debasement before Johnson&#8217;s
hunting pack. &#8220;The United States,&#8221; he reported on 9 April, &#8220;was
isolating itself from its many friends, except, oddly enough, the
British Labour Government.&#8221; He continued, on 13 April, &#8220;some
senior members of the (United States) Administration, all
well-disposed Anglophiles, have suggested that Britain&#8217;s interests
are not best served by the Prime Minister&#8217;s constant support of
American policies.&#8221; Delicate language this. Translated into Labour
Movement English, &#8220;this Branch/Party is appalled ...&#8221;</p>

<p>Here are two capital political issues, potentially involving
larger numbers and more intense feelings than any we&#8217;ve had for
many years. Yet, given the mood of the Labour Party ranks &#8211; proud
in power, confused and frustrated in policy &#8211; and given its growing
isolation from seemingly non-political movements outside, there&#8217;s a
danger that the political crises will pass with nothing gained, i.e.
without heightened clarity of aims in the labour movement generally
and without any organization to uphold it.</p>

<p>We can&#8217;t let it go at that. <em>There&#8217;s a cluster of
trade-union branches affiliated to every Labour Party. Through them
there is often an indirect link with local trades councils. Together
they are in a position to initiate representative meetings in which
local shop-stewards&#8217; committees, tenants&#8217; committees, political
and other groupings could be invited to participate.</em> Such
meetings &#8211; on the Labour Government and the Labour Movement &#8211;
might not add up to much, but 1 plus 1 make 2, 2 plus 2 make 4 ...
until, very quickly, you lose count.</p>
