<p class="fst">On the 30th April, the trade-union top brass met to add their Amen
to the Government&#8217;s 3&#189; per cent &#8220;wages norm.&#8221; &#8220;There was no
question,&#8221; said George Woodcock, &#8220;of appeal to patriotism or
Labour Party loyalty,&#8221; but simply of acting &#8220;in the interests of
trade-union members.&#8221; Yet during the weeks before, the same people
had accepted on behalf of those same trade-union members increases of
10 per cent (dockers), 9.7 per cent (postal workers) and 9 per cent
(railwaymen) &#8211; nearly three times the &#8220;norm.&#8221; And in the coming
weeks, after the Amen, they will still be reaching out for &#8211; and
getting &#8211; the norm-plus which is the going rate at the moment.</p>

<p>What are we to make of all this? Can it be that the men who want
more in their several union headquarters are satisfied with less in
the decorous atmosphere of Congress House? In a way, yes. When
brought to face with the consequences of their actions for the system
as a whole, those for whom this is an unfamiliar experience can also
be brought to see the problems terrifyingly larger than life. And
even for those used to padding through the corridors of power it is
an unnerving experience to realise that they have nothing to put in
the system&#8217;s place.</p>

<p>But this can&#8217;t be the entire explanation. Even Statesmanship
stops short at refusing above-norm pay rises. Perhaps the paradox is
formal rather than real? And so it is: <em>the high increases quoted
in the press (and in this column) relate to basic wages not to
earnings, while the norm relates to earnings.</em> If, as often
happens, the basic forms only 50&#8211;60 per cent of take-home pay, it
can go up by 6&#8211;7 per cent without breaking past the &#8220;norm.&#8221;</p>

<p>But 6&#8211;7 per cent is still not 9&#8211;10 per cent. There must be
more to the explanation. And so there is. Anthony Crosland, the
Minister for Education, hinted at it when speaking to the National
Union of Teachers&#8217; Conference at Douglas: &#8220;teachers&#8217; pay,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;should now go up by more than the incomes and prices norm.&#8221;
No Minister could do that without Cabinet approval, or without having
got clearance from George Brown. So it seems that the Government is
in on this first act of wage &#8220;normalisation.&#8221; While perhaps not
welcoming the increases, it is not prepared to resist them.</p>

<p>But if Act I is Give, Act II is Take. In exchange for this boost
to their, domestic position, the trade-union brass will be expected
to police their members more effectively than hitherto and in
particular to arrest unofficial wage-claims and struggles and to
break down the rank-and-file job-defences known as &#8220;restrictive
practices.&#8221; &#8211; The Hon. Harold Wilson, no less, has set the task
(in his speech to the USDAW&#8217;s Annual Conference):</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;From now on,&#8221; he said, &#8220;every ounce of increased
production will come from better and newer methods ... and an attack
on any practice wherever it may be found ... which unnecessarily
limits production, or artificially insists on excess in manning of
particular jobs, be those in productive industry, distribution, the
basic industries, the docks, or the nation&#8217;s transport system.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Nobody pretends that the trade-union brass is going to find the
going easy. There would have been such careful preparation if they
did. But what with the covering of the Government&#8217;s massive
propaganda barrage, the disciplining effect of the equally massive
deflation already begun, and the strength that comes from fighting a
<em>co-ordinated crusade</em> &#8220;for England,&#8221; they are likely to
find it easier than for some time.</p>

<p>The first objects for policing are bound to be the shop-stewards&#8217;
committees, site committees and rank-and-file organisations
generally. Given the apparent size of the current
nationally-negotiated increase their appeal is sure to be dimmed for
a while; and given the blast of propaganda their own members&#8217;
loyalties are bound to be shaken at the margin. At the same time the
trade-union brass know that they form the only possible alternative
leadership to their own and one whose collective appeal is bound to
grow tremendously as the &#8220;norm&#8221; and the attack on workshop
practice begin to bite, and as the gilt of the current increases rubs
off in the shops.</p>

<p>It is now that socialists &#8211; and the many non-socialist militants
&#8211; need increasingly to draw a distinction between our movement and
theirs. Our major effort must be to support &#8211; blindly &#8211; workers
on unofficial strike against both boss and brass, and to pack
everything into the defence of the autonomous rank-and-file
organisations within the labour movement. With the official
trade-union machine openly supporting the Government and the
Government openly sustaining British Capital, it is our duty to
proclaim to the trade-union leadership: <em>Yours is not our policy;
it is not a working-class policy; Divided We Stand, United We Fall!</em></p>
