<p class="info">From <strong>Labour Worker</strong>, 15 February 1965.<br />
Transcribed by Ian Birchall, Nina Kidron &amp; Richard Kuper.<br />
Marked up by <a href="../../../../../admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Marxists&#8217; Internet Archive</strong>.</p>

<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">Very few factories are automated from the word &#8220;go.&#8221; There are
still fewer that never introduce a new machine or method of work. The
overwhelming bulk lie somewhere in between, introducing technical
improvements, more productive machines, bits and pieces of
automation, as part of the normal processes of investment and competition.</p>

<p>Once introduced, these piecemeal innovations have to be absorbed
into the works. If they are more productive than the equipment they
displace &#8211; as they almost invariably are &#8211; pressure will build up
on the bosses&#8217; side to speed up work further down the line where
the bottleneck now appears to be, or to get the workers who seem now
to be holding up production to work longer hours. If the new machines
amalgamate jobs and create redundancies, the management will try to
propel the ones affected out of the gates or, if that looks like
creating trouble, into another shop or section where, perhaps,
bonuses are less and conditions worse.</p>

<p>Over the years, shop stewards&#8217; committees have worked out
methods of dealing with such problems. There have been strains.
Occasionally they find workers resistant to fighting redundancy, or
willing to kill themselves with overtime (even compulsory overtime).
But in most cases they find it relatively easy to prove that the
interests of all lie with the few, and no trouble at all to convince
the few of their dependence on the many.</p>

<p>Not so with the impact of partial automation or piecemeal
innovation on works rate structures. Here shop-stewards are torn
between two utterly opposed principles, both strongly embedded in
workers&#8217; attitudes, and both well tried in building up factory
organization. Or so it seems. <em>One is that the boss should not get
all the advantages from the higher productivity, but should be made
to share it with the man doing the work. The other is the tradition
of factory solidarity, reinforced by the fact that adjustments to the
new equipment are usually effected further down the line by other workers.</em></p>

<p>It is a difficult choice. Shop-stewards can&#8217;t be expected to
give up lightly one of their best &#8211; and best-tried &#8211; arguments
for pay increases. Nor can they be expected to ignore the strong
feelings of the men working the new machines. On the other hand, they
can&#8217;t afford to allow sectional interests to flourish in one part
of the factory and problems in another. No wonder few committees have
worked out a plan.</p>

<p>Yet there must be one. Partial automation is becoming the rule in
industry. Traditional rate structures are bursting at the seams and
committee meetings are becoming acrimonious.</p>

<p>Nor can there be any doubt about the sort of plan needed. Any
innovation affects the whole factory. Innovations tending towards
automated flow-production, as most of them now are, affect the whole
factory even more. Right, no work on new equipment without increased
rates. But together with that, no work without these increases
covering the whole labour force. A <em>factory</em> rate over the odds
now; an <em>industry</em> rate tomorrow. And who knows what the next
day will bring!</p>

<p><em>It&#8217;s not going to be easy. In this the boss often has a
strong ally in the individual machine operator who sees chance slip
by. Isn&#8217;t he the one delivering the increased production?</em> What
have the cleaners got to do with it? And shop-stewards&#8217; committees
might find more than one revolt on their hands.</p>

<p>But choose they must. All or one?</p>
