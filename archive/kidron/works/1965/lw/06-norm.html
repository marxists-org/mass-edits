<h1>Normpolitik ...</h1>

<h3>(June 1965)</h3>

<hr class="infotop" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Review</strong>, 1 June 1965, p.&nbsp;3.<br />
Transcribed by Ian Birchall, Nina Kidron &amp; Richard Kuper.<br />
Marked up by <a href="../../../../../admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Marxists&#8217; Internet Archive</strong>.</p>

<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">What about this norm then? They tell us that for the next five
years or so the average rate of growth in output will be &#8220;something
approaching 3&#189; per cent&#8221; (para 4 of Brown&#8217;s <strong>White Paper</strong> on
<em>Prices and Incomes Policy</em>). They tell us that prices are to be
kept stable (paras 6&#8211;8). So real wage increases will be equal to
money wage increases which they allow at 3&#8211;3&#189; per cent per year
(para 11). That is their norm &#8211; 3&#8211;3&#189; per cent per year <em>real
increase in wages</em>.</p>

<p>Why then this fuss about the postmen&#8217;s 9 per cent, or the
provincial busmen&#8217;s proposed 12 per cent? On their own reckoning
these fall within the norm. Look at it this way. Prices have not
remained stable. In twelve months they have risen 6 per cent, which
means that all workers are entitled to an increase of that amount
merely to keep level with last year&#8217;s real income. Add to that the
3&#8211;3&#189; per cent &#8220;norm&#8221;-al increase to make 9&#8211;9&#189; per cent,
which by the same token is the increase all workers are automatically
entitled to. Add to that &#8211; if you want to push things &#8211; another
2&#8211;3&#189;per cent to cover the gap between negotiated rates and
take-home pay, and you arrive at a grand total of 11&#8211;13 per cent or
about 37s.&nbsp;6d.&#8211;44s. on average in manufacturing. And this
without the special cases envisaged in the Brown Paper.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get it then. True, we oppose their Brown Paper and all
that goes with it. But if bargaining is going to be with reference to
it, our trade union brass had better get what the prospectus offers
and boast less about their sub-&#8220;norm&#8221;-al victories.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>... And Realpolitik</h4>

<p class="fst">The Legal Committee of the West German Parliament has been
drafting a National Emergency Bill for more than two years. They have
done so quietly, taking care to bypass the customary arrangements
whereby other Members and outside expert bodies are kept informed of
the trend in discussions. And no wonder. The Bill provides for
complete Executive Government, for suppression of trade unions and
the introduction of compulsory civilian service, for the use of the
army against the home population, for the suppression of
constitutional rights, etc., etc. &#8211; in the event of an Emergency.
It is an atrocious Bill and one that the Government plans to enact in
a hurry. So far the DGB (The German TUC) has confined itself to
formal protests, while the SPD (German Labour Party) have kept mum in
support. It has fallen to student bodies in the main, backed by
liberal academics, to organize public protest.</p>

<p>A demonstration against the Bill was held in Bonn on 30 May. And
others will be held. It would be of tremendous value to the
organizers if they could receive cabled messages of support. Their
address: Committee Against Emergency Laws, 6 Frankfurt/Main,
Kurfurstenstr. 8, West Germany.</p>
