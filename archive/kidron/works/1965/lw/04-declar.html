<p class="fst">There&#8217;s little that&#8217;s, real behind the hocus-pocus of the
Budget, with its parliamentary peacockery, its battered Treasury Box,
the verbal meandering until dealings switch from the floor of the
Stock Exchange to the stockbrokers&#8217; officers at 4.30&nbsp;p.m. New
departures in expenditure are almost impossible since most of the
items are committed years in advance. <em>This is true of the outlay
on current and future wars (29 per cent of the total last year), on
the National Debt or past wars (10 per cent), and on most of the
social services like National Assistance, unemployment benefits,
health, housing, education, etc. (28 per cent), as on most of the
rest.</em> The room for manoeuvre remains very small &#8211; a couple of
hundred million each way on a total of around &#163;8,000 million.</p>

<p>The same is true of Revenue. Fixed expenditure and the need to
operate within a capitalist consensus sets fairly inflexible limits
to what the Chancellor can do in current circumstances. The argument
revolves around relatively small sums : is he going to squeeze
another &#163;100 million out of tax-payers? or will it be &#163;200 million?
or, in an election year, will he &#8220;give away&#8221; &#163;50 million?</p>

<p>No wonder really big business takes Budgets in its stride. The
giant firms also make long-term plans, are committed years in advance
to certain levels of expenditure, and find short-term adjustments a
nuisance. As Lord Fleck, then chairman of ICI told the <em>Radcliffe
Committee on the Working of the Monetary System</em> in 1959.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;It would be wrong to say that Budgets are of no
interest, but I cannot recall any of them that made any significant
change in our approach to what we were thinking of doing.&#8221;</em></p>

<p class="fst">His views were echoed by Lords Godber of Shell and Heyworth of Unilever.</p>

<p>Yet behind the hocus-pocus and the minute adjustments of revenue
and expenditure there is more than pure tradition. With more than
two-fifths of annual investments in its hands, anything the
Government does in the economy is of enormous consequence to private
capital. So they watch it like hawks. <em>On the other hand, it is now
easy for some capitalists here and abroad to switch their wealth from
Pounds to any other currency and the country&#8217;s reserves of such
currencies and gold are so low that the Government &#8211; particularly
our Labour Government with its repulsive mixture of cowardice and
orthodoxy &#8211; dare not upset them.</em> And it so happens that the
ones who find it easiest to transfer funds abroad and therefore have
the strongest claim to be cosseted and comforted &#8211; the bankers and
financiers &#8211; are the most backward, the most conservative and with
the narrowest time-horizons of all sections of their class. Their
first reaction is to bolt at the first hint of trouble and, what with
the obvious shakiness of British capitalism, there are hints enough.</p>

<p>Given the Pound&#8217;s weakness, the Budget message is directed
primarily to them. They have to be made to feel confident that the
Government&#8217;s economic power will be used in a manner they would
approve of. <em>And given their flighty internationalism, their
conservatism and extremely short-term perspectives even in capitalist
terms, the manner must be nasty, brutal and deflationary &#8211; whether
it is necessary for British capitalism to deflate or not.</em> And the
more openly this is done the better.</p>

<p>Confidence is the theme. If Callaghan can inspire confidence in
London as a conservatory for capital; if he can persuade the City and
its friends abroad that they will grow riotously under his care, he
will have done his duty. <em>But to do it and live down the radical
origins &#8211; of so long ago &#8211; of the Labour Party, he needs to be
harsh to workers, the old and poor; patently so, even exaggeratedly so.</em></p>

<p>It&#8217;s not difficult to agree with Lords Fleck, Godber and
Heyworth &#8211; the Budget is unlikely to effect a radical turn in
Britain&#8217;s economic life. <em>But as a Declaration of Dependence on
the most purblind section of private capital the whole world over it
is unbeatable.</em></p>
