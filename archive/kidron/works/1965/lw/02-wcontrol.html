<p class="quoteb">&#8220;What we need in this country, comrades, and in the
world at large, is socialism!&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Hands clap. Thought moves on to other things.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Next business!&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">And so another wrap is gently added to the mummy of politics in
the party, and the members get another fix of ritualism.</p>

<p>We all know the pattern. Every constituency GMC has its gleamster,
guardian of the faith, the man who &#8211; with rousing phrase &#8211; will
hearten consciences that have been gently jolted by yet another compromise.</p>

<p>Usually, he belong to the Right. Not always. Recently the Left has
been producing its own brand of gleamster &#8211; the sincere, ardent
comrade for whom no problem exists but can be solved by invoking
&#8220;workers&#8217; control.&#8221; To attack wage freeze, fight for workers&#8217;
control; to solve an industrial grievance, strike for workers&#8217;
control; to overcome ignorance and apathy in the labour movement,
talk about workers&#8217; control. If &#8211; to go back a bit &#8211; a Young
Socialist Conference passes, without argument, a resolution calling
for workers&#8217; control and also, after heated debate, one calling for
checks on immigration, salute the heightened consciousness of our youth.</p>

<p>Before its well-wishes so devalue the concept that its enemies can
afford to ignore it, a few lines should be written in perspective.</p>

<p>Workers&#8217; control of production can&#8217;t be a partial matter. To
win control of hiring (as in the docks or markets, and in some pits
and factories) and of firing (as in fewer cases, more in the US than
here), or to win influence over promotion, is to win the right to
administer part of the bosses&#8217; empire.</p>

<p>While the winning can be of tremendous value, and the short-term
gains sometimes considerable, victory can easily turn sour as
workers, particularly the ones administering the victory, take on the
goals and attitudes built into that empire.</p>

<p>To be more than self-administration within the confines of
Capital, workers&#8217; control must be total, that is, it must take over
all production decisions and the state to enforce them. But the
occasions on which workers are conscious of this need are very rare
indeed &#8211; once, perhaps twice in a generation, when unexceptional
demands are thwarted by some sort of crisis in the system. should be
written in perspective.</p>

<p>On such rare occasions, the demand for workers&#8217; control will
help to plug local grievances and struggles into the working-class
grid. Otherwise, let&#8217;s keep it where it belongs as a key to
understanding socialism &#8211; in educational sessions, not mucking up
the agitational scene, or lending comfort to political impotence.</p>

<p>For the moment the problem is wage freeze &#8211; w-a-g-e f-r-e-e-z-e
&#8211; not workers&#8217; control. I&#8217;m sorry that this is so. But talking
won&#8217;t help.</p>
