<p class="fst">Nineteen hundred and fifty-four was a boom year for British
capitalists: production rose by six per cent above the 1953 figure,
profits by ten per cent, dividends by 22 per cent (30 per cent in
engineering), share values by 40 per cent (84 per cent in
engineering), and exports, both by volume and value, were the highest
ever recorded, in spite bf the dock strike. For British workers,
however, 1954 was anything but a boom year: while wages rose by four
per cent (less than 1s. in the &#163;), prices rose by four per cent as
well, and food prices by bight per cent. Real wages were frozen while
profits soared.</p>

<p>Nineteen hundred and fifty-five therefore started with wage claims
demanded by five million workers, with the greatest trial of strength
between the railwaymen and the bosses since 1926, with a conscious
struggle on the part of the bosses (British European Airways in
London, Standard Motors in Coventry, Wright and Platt&#8217;s in
Birmingham) to stop the threatened avalanche of wage demands by
hitting at its main strength &#8211; the shop stewards. Nineteen hundred
and fifty-five certainly looks as if it is to see an intensification
of the class war. Are our tactics of a wages struggle, pure and
simple, sufficient to win? If not, what must be added?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Lessons of the Rail Settlement</h4>

<p class="fst">In last month&#8217;s <strong>Socialist Review</strong>, the <a href="02-rail.html" target="new">article</a> on the <em>Rail
Settlement</em> came to the following general conclusion:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Better pay by itself is not enough. Now that industry
is so integrated with the State and so &#8216;centrally planned&#8217; that a
concession to the workers here can always be recovered by the
Capitalists, many times, over somewhere else, the demand for improved
working conditions cannot stand alone. It must be coupled with other,
wider demands to form a complete transitional program to Socialism.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This conclusion is based on the history of the negotiations for a
15 per cent wage increase between the N.U.R. and the B.T.C., but its
implications are much deeper and affect the activity of every
militant unionist in the country.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Expanding Markets and Real Wage Increases</h4>

<p class="fst">As long as the capitalist market is expanding, as long as there
are potential &#8220;consumers &#8221; to be captured by the capitalist
productive machine, individual capitalist enterprises compete with
one another for the golden goose. The prices charged for their
products are relatively fixed by this competition for new buyers:
each capitalist has to keep his prices down to the ruling price in
the market if he does not want to be &#8220;out-priced&#8221; arid, as every
capitalist is trying to out-price every other in order to get
complete, monopoly control of the new markets, prices are kept low.
Under such conditions; prices are fixed for the capitalist by
competition. The individual firm can do nothing about it &#8211; prices
are simply there, like the smoke from its chimneys.</p>

<p>If capitalist competition itself puts a ceiling on prices, it is
obvious that any increase in wages forced out of the capitalist must
come out of profits and can not be passed on to the &#8220;consumer&#8221; in
the form of higher prices or shoddier goods.</p>

<p>What goes for one capitalist applies to all of them. While markets
are expanding and labour power scarce, a rise in wages in one sector
of the economy creates irresistible pressure on the rest of the
capitalists to concede rises to their workers as well, otherwise they
would be without a labour force in the long run.</p>

<p>In such a period, wage demands. &#8220;pure and simple&#8221; can achieve
real results in the form of higher living standards. Under such
conditions, the militant unionist can be progressive and yet not
revolutionary. Those conditions no longer exist, in the main.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Capitalist Stagnation and the Real-Wage Freeze</h4>

<p class="fst">The beginning of the century put an end to the period of free
competition, of the spontaneous growth of markets. Since then,
anarchic markets have been replaced by conscious manipulations by
monopoly concerns; competition gave way to collusion. The only
expanding market was (and is) the war market, which hastened the
monopolisation process by strengthening the State and integrating the
State with monopoly capitalism: the State now became the greatest
customer, the State saw to it that there need be no competition
between the Centred of capital in one country, the State regulated
wages and kept them clamped under an &#8220;official&#8221; ceiling.</p>

<p>The first World War announced this change in the internal
organisation of Capitalism, the slum of the thirties emphasised it,
and the second World War, with its progeny, of local &#8220;brushfire
wars, took it for granted. Monopoly control and the integration of
State and monopoly form the pattern of modern Capitalism.</p>

<p>Now in general, there are no price ceilings for the individual
monopolist. If one monopoly raises prices, the others usually follow
suit as result of some type of agreement between them.</p>
