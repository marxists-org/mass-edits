<p class="fst">Once again Merseyside has struck. For the second time in six
months the National Amalgamated Stevedores and Dockers Union has led
the Merseyside dockers to victory. This time the fight was short and
the victory solid.</p>

<p>Last October, O&#8217;Hare of Deakin&#8217;s Transport and General
Workers&#8217; Union threatened that nobody would be able to work on the
Merseyside unless he could show a white (T.&amp;G.) union card.
N.A.S.D. (blue card) members would be excluded from the docks. The
Merseyside Port Employers&#8217; Association did not bother to point out
that such a threat was illegal, that there was nothing in the Dock
Labour Scheme to force a man to join any particular union. They were
quite happy about the disruptive tactics of the T.&amp;G.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s bluff was to be called on March 28th, when the
registration books &#8211; without which you cannot work in the docks &#8211;
were to be changed and re-issued. On Sunday, 27th, the Merseyside
Executive of the N.A.S.D.U. met and recommended that &#8220;If one man
was refused his book, a strike would be called.&#8221; The same day, a
mass meeting accepted this recommendation unanimously. The next day,
at 8&nbsp;a.m. the first report came in from Garston; a N.A.S.D.
member had been refused his book. By noon 14,000 men were out.
Merseyside was solid, with blue card holders and white card holders
picketing the gates together.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Employers Give In</h4>

<p class="fst">On the same afternoon, the Manchester Port Employers gave in. They
weren&#8217;t prepared for the tremendous response that met the strike
call from the membership of both unions; they weren&#8217;t prepared for
the pressure from the London Port Employers who dreaded a solidarity
strike in their own area. The next day the Merseyside Port Employers&#8217;
Association met and threw in the towel. By the following day most of
the men were back at work, having won hands down, confident in the
strength of their militant union &#8211; the National Amalgamated
Stevedores and Dockers. For the first time in years a strike had been
led and organized by their official union; it was the Executive that
brought them out, it was the Executive that took them back, them and
their comrades in the T.&amp;G.</p>

<p>Some people were disgruntled at the outcome. First &#8211; the
Merseyside Employers. The N.A.S.D. used a clever tactic to isolate
them from their London friends. N.A.S.D. demanded recognition pure
and simple. They demanded from the Merseyside employers what they had
already won from the London employers. Obviously, the London
employers did not have much stomach to fight a battle they had lost
already once before. So the small N.A.S.D., by making a simple,
limited demand, managed to drive a wedge between the two groups of
employers and appear on the map of dockland outside London.</p>

<p>The T.&amp;G. is also none too pleased. It has always held a
monopoly position as far as workers&#8217; &#8220;representation&#8221; on the
Dock Labour Scheme is concerned. Another union &#8211; and a militant one
at that &#8211; would either force it to take action in defending its
members&#8217; interests or would attract its membership away. This isn&#8217;t
only a threat as far as the T.&amp;G. is concerned: between the first
dock strike (October 1954) and this last one, 4,000 of the 17,000
Merseyside dockers had changed cards and joined the unrecognised
N.A.S.D. Now with recognition firmly established we can look forward
to a landslide of new members for the union which knows how to defend
dockers&#8217; interests.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Unhappy C.P.</h4>

<p class="fst">The Communist Party is also unhappy. A left-wing non-Stalinist
union has shown that it can fight and win, that it can gain the
confidence of the industry&#8217;s workers, that it can offer an
independent socialist leadership. That is why the <strong>Daily Worker</strong>
(7/4/55) speaks of a four day dock strike (Instead of the two-day
strike that actually took place) in its attempt to publicise Jack
Lyden&#8217;s bid to capture the leadership of the strike by extending
it, by tagging on outstanding wage claims and claims for better
working conditions, and so endangering its success. The attempt was a
failure. The reason for the failure &#8211; the constructive, militant
policy of the N.A.S.D.</p>

<p>Organised labour in Britain can learn much from the N.A.S.D.,
small as it is. It shows that neither the heavy hand of right-wing
bureaucracy nor the irresponsible tactics of the Communist Party can
destroy a militant, left wing struggle. The N.A.S.D. is important, it
realises in its day to day struggle the slogan: <em>Neither Washington
nor Moscow, but International Socialism.</em></p>
