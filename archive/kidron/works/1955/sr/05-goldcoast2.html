<p class="fst">The <a href="04-goldcoast1.html" target="new">first part</a> of this article in last month&#8217;s <strong>Socialist Review</strong> showed that &#8220;the people of the Gold Coast have very
little to say in determining their own welfare. Whoever controls the
Gold Coast State controls the economy of the country and the standard
of life of its inhabitants.&#8221; It then asked &#8220;who controls the Gold
Coast State? What of the famed progress towards independence that we
hear so much about?&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Constitutional Reform &#8211; Labour</h4>

<p class="fst">The Gold Coast Constitution, prepared and implemented in 1949 and
1950 under the Labour Government, was a direct sequel to the Gold
Coast &#8220;riots&#8221; of 1948 in which 29 people were killed and 237
injured. Although much was made of the &#8220;progress towards
self-government&#8221; at the time a brief glance at some of its clauses
will show that the Colonial Office in the person of the Governor held
all the important strings in its hands. One example must suffice:
Section 58 of the Gold Coast Constitution reads as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If the Governor considers that it is expedient in the
interests of public order, public faith or good government, which ...
shall include the responsibility of the Gold Coast as a territory
within the British Commonwealth of Nations, and all matters
pertaining to the creation or abolition of any public office or to
the salary or other conditions of service of any public officer that
any Bill introduced, or any motion proposed, in the Assembly, should
have effect, then, if the Assembly fail to pass such Bill or motion
within such time and in such form as the Governor may think
reasonable or expedient, the Governor, at any time which he shall
think fit may, notwithstanding any provisions of this Order or of any
Standing Orders of the Assembly, declare that such Bill or motion
shall have effect as if it had been passed by the Assembly ...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Not only did the Labour Government Coussey Constitution give the
Governor more powers than the Assembly itself, it also forced on the
Gold Coast Cabinet three <em>ex-officio</em> British Ministers &#8211;
those for Defence and External Affairs, for Finance, and the Attorney General.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Constitutional Reform &#8211; Tory</h4>

<p class="fst">The next step towards &#8220;independence&#8221; came under the Tory
Government. The Tories introduced a &#8220;reform&#8221; which, as the
<strong>Economist</strong> said, was &#8220;far removed in spirit from the slogan
of &#8216;self-government now&#8217; which echoed through Accra (the capital)
three years ago&#8221; (1/8/53). The <strong>Economist</strong> gives us the
essentials of the reform:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The three European officers in the Executive Council
are to be replaced by African Ministers. But the Attorney General is
to remain an official apart from the new Minister of Justice, while
the new Finance Minister will have an economic advisor, presumably
also a European official or officer on special duty. The Governor is
to remain responsible for external affairs and defence, and is to
share responsibility for police, security and public services with an
African Minister ... the Governor would have reserved powers as at
present.&#8221; (27/6/53)</p>

<p class="fst">Even after such a mite of window-dressing, the Gold Coast
Government had to pay. After the elections held at the beginning of
last year, when Dr. Nkrumah&#8217;s Convention People&#8217;s Party came in
with a large majority, he told the Assembly that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;the Government did not envisage any limitation on the
present freedom to transfer without restrictions profits arising from
non-resident capital investment, or to repatriate foreign capital
invested in the Gold Coast.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;The present Government had no plans for nationalizing
industry ... and it did not envisage any such proposals arising.&#8221;
(<strong>Times</strong>, 2/3/54).</p>

<p class="fst">No wonder British business thought that &#8220;the most satisfactory
outcome of the Gold Coast elections is undoubtedly the comfortable
working majority achieved by Dr. Nkrumah and his Convention People&#8217;s
Party.&#8221; (<strong>Economist</strong>, 15/6/54)</p>

<p>The State in the Gold Coast is controlled from London. All this
constitutional juggling is &#8220;independence&#8221; as seen from Whitehall.
As seen from the Gold Coast, it is a model carefully dressed in the
shop-window of British Imperialism, to be looked at, but not touched.</p>
