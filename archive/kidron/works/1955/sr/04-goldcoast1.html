<p class="fst">The Gold Coast has always been the shop-window of British
Imperialism. The capitalist press cannot ignore the bloody oppression
in Kenya and Malaya, the high-handed rejection of national
aspirations in British Guiana and Cyprus, the administrative rule in
Uganda, and the Central Federation, to mention only a few, but they
point with pride to the Gold Coast. Here, we are told, enlightened
rule has guided a backward people along the high road of economic
prosperity and national independence. Soon, they assure us, the Gold
Coast will qualify for membership in the British Commonwealth. How
true is this? Is the Gold Coast as independent as the capitalist
press make her out to be?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>British Imperialism in West Africa</h4>

<p class="fst">One of the Gold Coast&#8217;s greatest defences against Imperialist
oppression is its climate. It was always known as &#8220;the White Man&#8217;s
Grave.&#8221; As George Padmore puts it: &#8220;The Anopheles mosquito &#8211;
the carrier of the malaria germ &#8211; and its fellow mosquito, the
Aedes-Aegypti, the carrier of yellow fever, have saved over
30,000,000 blacks in Nigeria, the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and Gambia
from the worst economic depredations of Imperialism.&#8221; (<strong>Africa,
Britain&#8217;s Third Empire</strong>, London, 1950, p.&nbsp;80). It is this
reason alone that left the West African population in control of its
own land and prevented their expropriation as in Kenya where the
Kenya Order gave 12,750 square miles &#8211; the White Highlands &#8211; to
29,000 Europeans, and herded more than 5,000,000 Africans into 43,500
square miles of bad quality land.</p>

<p>Although the people of the Gold Coast have escaped the worst
excesses of British Imperialism, they have not escaped them all. The
extent of poverty and disease is appalling. A Government report stated:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Food deficiency is a predisposing factor in many local
disease conditions. Tuberculosis, the pneumonias and bronchitis are
very prevalent and together account for 30 per cent of all registered
male deaths. Over 70 per cent of persons in the coast town of
Saltpond gave evidence of tubercle infection. There seems to be a
close relationship between undernutrition and the incidence of
leprosy ...&#8221; (<strong>Nutrition in the Colonial Empire</strong>, Part II,
Cmd. 6051, 1939, pp.&nbsp;35&#8211;6)</p>

<p class="fst">Out of every 1,000 babies born, 400 die before the age of twelve.
(R. Hinden, <strong>Plan for Africa</strong>, London 1941, p.&nbsp;176) Lord
Hailey believes that from 50 to 90 per cent of the population is
affected by venerebal diseases. (<strong>An African Survey</strong>, Oxford
1938, p.&nbsp;1145). And yet, after more than 150 years of British
rule in the Gold Coast, the total number of hospital beds is only
1,049 (plus 123 cots), while in London alone we have more than 50,000.</p>

<p>Poverty and disease are not a &#8220;natural calamity&#8221; in the Gold
Coast. The country itself is rich, very rich.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Economics &#8211; Cocoa</h4>

<p class="fst">The main wealth of the Gold Coast lies in her cocoa farms. Three
hundred thousand peasant farmers produce about 300,000 tons of cocoa
a year which netted the country about &#163;60 million pounds annually
between 1949 and 1951. Altogether, cocoa provides 70 per cent of the
country&#8217;s income in foreign currency. It is one of Britain&#8217;s
primary sources of dollars and other hard currencies as 40 per cent
of the annual output is normally sold in the United States. And yet
the producers themselves receive only a fraction of the price that
cocoa fetches on the world market. In 1950&#8211;1951, the peasant
producer was receiving &#163;130&nbsp;14s.&nbsp;0d. per ton, while the
cocoa sold at &#163;254&nbsp;10s.&nbsp;0d. The peasant saw only 51 per
cent of the price of his product. The rest went in export duties (20
percent) and in profits to the Cocoa Marketing Board (29 per cent).</p>

<p>The Cocoa Marketing Board is interesting. It was set up originally
as a result of a mass boycott (in 1937&#8211;8) organised by the peasants
against the British cocoa buyers (United Africa Company, a subsidiary
of Unilevers, Cadbury&#8217;s, J. Lyons and Co., and others), who formed
a pool to force down cocoa prices. It was meant to stabilize prices
to the African peasant and yet, as one authority writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;As a result of the price policies of the Cocoa Boards,
the incomes of the cocoa producers have not only been greatly reduced
but they have fluctuated more violently over these years than if the
crops had been paid for at full market value.&#8221; (P.T. Bauer, <strong>West
African Trade</strong>, Cambridge 1954, p.&nbsp;300)</p>

<p class="fst">But if the Board has not fulfilled its duties towards the peasant,
it certainly has fulfilled another function very well, that of
accumulating profits (over &#163;150 million to date). In fact, the Cocoa
Marketing Board is the only real saver in the Gold Coast. As Bauer
puts it, &#8220;For good or evil the boards must be seen as instruments
for the socialisation of savings and for a large measure of
government control and socialisation of peasant production in West
Africa.&#8221; (p.&nbsp;316)<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Economics &#8211; The Volta River Scheme</h4>

<p class="fst">The Gold Coast Government is not only the sole saver in the Gold
Coast. It is also one of the most important investors, as can be seen
from the much publicized Volta River Scheme.</p>

<p>The scheme is to build a huge dam on the
Volta River in order to generate electricity, which will be used
primarily for the production of aluminium from the vast deposits of
over 200 million tons of bauxite nearby. The project is to be
financed by the British Government, the Gold Coast Government, and
the African Aluminium Co., which is a subsidiary of the Canadian
company, Aluminium Ltd., and the British Aluminium Co. The British
Government is to pay for the dam and the power plant, the Gold Coast
Government for the roads, railways and port facilities connected with
the scheme, and the aluminium companies are to build and own the
smelting plant. The only profit making part of the scheme is the
smelting plant in which the Gold Coast Government may hold ten per
cent of the shares (<strong>Times</strong>, 4/7/53).</p>

<p>The advantages of the scheme to the privately owned aluminium
companies is obvious. They will have control of one of the largest
deposits of bauxite in the world. They will obtain the lion&#8217;s share
of the profits while investing less than one third of the capital
(&#163;42.6 million out of a total of &#163;140 million). The advantages to
the British Government are also obvious &#8211; it is assured of a
constant non-dollar supply of aluminium, as it will have priority on
75 per cent of the output for at least 30 years. (Government White
Paper, <strong>Volta River Aluminium Scheme</strong>, Cmd. 8702, 1952, p.&nbsp;1)
The advantages to the Gold Coast are not at all obvious, however. The
White Paper does not disclose what royalties, if any, will be paid to
the local government, nor what taxes, if any. The savings that the
Gold Coast government extracts from the peasant by paying him a
fraction of the price of his products is to be invested in the
non-profit making part of the scheme. Whatever part it does play is
clearly more in the interests of the private aluminium companies and
the British Government than in the interests of its own population.</p>

<p>The Gold Coast peasant is being forced to save money by the Gold
Coast Government through the Cocoa Marketing Board; the Gold Coast
Government is investing large sums in one of the biggest economic
ventures in the African continent &#8211; the Volta River Scheme &#8211; from
which it benefits to a very limited extent. The economic prosperity
which, so the capitalist press informs us, is part and parcel of Gold
Coast independence, is a prosperity for the foreign capitalists and
the British Government, not for the poverty-stricken, disease-ridden
people of the country. Clearly, the people of the Gold Coast have
very little say in determining their own welfare. The question that
remains to be answered is this: Whoever controls the Gold Coast State
controls the economy of the country and the standard of life of its
inhabitants. Who, then, controls the State? What of the famed
&#8220;progress towards independence&#8221; that we hear so much about?</p>

<p>To this question we shall come back in a <a href="05-goldcoast2.html" target="new">second article</a> in the
next issue.</p>
