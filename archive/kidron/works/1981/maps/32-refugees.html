<p class="fst">The world refugee population is large, fluctuating and poorly recorded. This map shows the numbers of new refugees between 1972 and 1979. Such refugees may either have been displaced within their own state of have been obliged to move to others across state frontiers.</p>

<p>Major refugee movements both before and since this period have not been included. For example, the Nigerian civil ware over Biafra in 1967&ndash;70 led to a major internal displacement of population; substantial flows of refugees have moved from Cuba to the USA both before and after the period; and since 1979 there have been regular reports of large numbers leaving Afghanistan and various provincial states in north-east India. A single exception has been made. The Palestinians have been included because of their continuing political importance and because, unlike so many other refugees, they have scarcely been resettled or absorbed.</p>
