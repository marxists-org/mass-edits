<h1>What sort of paper?</h1>

<h3>(February 1958)</h3>

<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Review</strong>, <a href="../../../../../history/etol/newspape/soc-rev-srg/index.html#sr58_02-2" target="new">8th Year No.&nbsp;4</a>, Mid-February 1958, p.&nbsp;8.<br />

<p class="fst">IF THE TORIES are &#8220;hammering home the need for class politics,&#8221;
then we need a <strong>Socialist Review</strong> that will be tolerably
readable and attractive to working people who are active in the
Labour movement, but who are not yet dedicated Socialists. Beyond
certain limits, it is not possible to build up the circulation of a
paper which seems to be written for professional revolutionaries. Is
the Editorial Board really so incredibly out of touch with the
reading habits and attitudes of its potential readership, as it seems
after reading the paper? Compared with other left-wing papers
<strong>Socialist Review</strong> reads like a junior version of <strong>The
Financial Times</strong>. Even for &#8220;egg heads&#8221; like us it&#8217;s an
effort to get through it. Is the Editorial Board really so
complacent? If the fortnightly is to survive, a wider readership, a
broader foundation is essential.</p>

<p>What is wanted &#8211; and quickly &#8211; is a heavyweight Marxist
version of <strong>Tribune</strong>. This can be achieved without increasing
our production costs (though the present large format is somewhat
outmoded and unattractive). <em>Contributors can be attracted when
they see what the editors are really trying to make of the paper.</em>
If <strong>Socialist Review</strong> is to become a political force, the
following changes in editorial policy are essential.</p>

<ol>
<li>A more attractive and up to date layout, especially to break up
the longer features, even though this means an apparently less
economical use of space. This means taking newspaper design
seriously; the old rule-of-thumb methods just won&#8217;t do today.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>More popular, topical items, such as are found in other
Left-wing papers, are needed. The odd concession to this principle
pleases no one. This does not mean a Marxist <strong>Daily Mirror</strong>.
Briefly, it means being a bit more human, getting closer to the
readers, getting beyond the present cramping, rigid ideas about class
struggle and class attitudes, however correct these may be.
Socialists do not stop being Socialists when they talk about books or
holidays or sport or read short stories. We want a paper that shows
by its interests that Socialism is a real brotherhood and way of
life, not a paper confined to a narrow political compartment for
round-the-clock activists. Whatever abuses involved, British CP
journalism is way ahead in this respect.<br/>
<br/>
As for the direct political stuff, a witty columnist, with an
anecdote about the antics at the last GMC or Union Branch meeting,
laced with racy workshop humour, can often get over a worthwhile
political idea more successfully than a frightening &#8216;theoretically
correct&#8217; analysis, lumbering across four tedious columns of close
black print, and written in a style fit for a book or learned journal
not a fortnightly Socialist paper.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Keep the long, heavyweight stuff down to one or two items:
then they will get the attention they deserve. In such articles try
to explain abstractions in simple, concrete terms taken from workers&#8217;
everyday experiences. Then the article will live and will be
remembered. If you write about Workers&#8217; Control of Industry, and
you <em>have</em> to say &#8220;Participation in the control of management would restore dignity
to labour,&#8221; at least remind the readers what you mean by &#8216;dignity
of labour&#8217; by specific reference to any of countless daily
incidents in factory and mine in which the &#8216;dignity of labour&#8217; is
flouted almost as a matter of course.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">These, we believe, are the main problems facing the fortnightly,
and the key to its future. An open discussion in the columns of the
paper, followed by definite decisions about what the paper should
look like and read like, is urgently necessary.</p>

<h2>[Reply]</h2>

<p class="fst">Are we so out of touch as the comrades seem to think? We are proud
to state that since September last year, that is, in the space of
only 6 months, 25 new contributors have written for <strong>SR</strong>; we are
also proud to state that circulation has not dropped at all despite
our increasing the frequency of publication by more than double.
These facts certainly disprove the allegation of being out of touch.</p>

<p>There is, of course, an explanation for the growing interest in
<strong>SR</strong>. Whatever its technical shortcomings &#8211; and there are
many, we know &#8211; it provides a political service and has a political
appeal that militant socialists cannot fail to appreciate. What other
paper in Britain presents such a clear, consistent socialist program?
(What other paper, indeed, dares tie itself down by printing what it
stands for?). What other paper raises so insistently problems of
socialist thought and socialist practice?</p>

<p>Our readers are attracted to what we say, to our content. If they
find that of sufficient importance, they will forgive a certain
amount of looseness in form.</p>

<p>Not that we like our technical incompetence. We are very conscious
of it and are doing our best to overcome it. But deal with us
patiently. Our resources are limited, very limited. Readers can help
by writing, criticizing and building the paper.</p>

<p>One final point. We are happy to print the letter from our
comrades in Harlow. We hope it will stimulate discussion amongst, and
correspondence from, comrades elsewhere. The paper is yours,
Comrades. It is yours to fashion as you see fit. &#8211; <em>Editor</em></p>
