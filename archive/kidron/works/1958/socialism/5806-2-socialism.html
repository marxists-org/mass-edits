<p class="c"><strong>Mike Kidron states the case for Workers&#8217; control</strong></p>

<h4>Even Ownership Has Little to Do with Control</h4>

<p class="fst">The nationalized industries in Britain are supposed to belong to
the people of Britain, yet they are obviously controlled by the
capitalists of the country. Article 6 of the Russian Constitution
reads: &#8220;The land, its deposits, waters, mills, factories, mines,
railways, water and air transport, banks, means of communication,
large state-organized farm enterprises (state farms, machine-tractor
stations, etc.) and also the basic housing facilities in cities and
industrial localities are <em>state property, that is, the wealth of
the people</em>.&#8221; (my emphasis &#8211; <em>MK</em>) Yet the land, etc., in
Russia is controlled by a small, independent bureaucracy. <em>Formal
ownership does not necessarily mean control.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Some examples</h4>

<p class="fst">There are other, more common, examples of this difference between
control and ownership. In a big Capitalist firm, there are voting
shares and non-voting shares. The non-voters own the firm in exactly
the same way as the voters, but only the voters have the right to
elect the board of directors, i.e., only the voters control policy.
Even then, not all the voters carry any weight in determining policy.
A man with a few shares is usually not sufficiently interested in the
firm to scrutinize its activities carefully or bother to come to the
shareholders&#8217; meetings, while one with a big bloc of shares is. The
many small &#8220;owners&#8221; may work at cross purposes, the big owner has
only his interests to look after. Usually, the ownership of about 25
per cent of voting shares is sufficient to give control of the whole
company and of all the other Capitalists&#8217; money invested in it.
(Sometimes only 5 per cent will do the trick). Control doesn&#8217;t
always stop there, however. The company may hold 25 per cent of the
voting shares in another couple of companies which, in turn, may hold
25 per cent of those in another few companies, and so on. Some
companies called &#8220;holding companies&#8221; are, in fact, specially
formed to control shares in this way, so that one group of
shareholders, although it really &#8220;owns&#8221; an insignificant
proportion of the total capital involved, might control a vast
economic empire.</p>

<p>It is as well to bear these facts in mind when capitalists come
out with their beautiful schemes for &#8220;co-partnership&#8221; in
industry. <em>The sense of solidarity with the boss which sometimes
accompanies the couple of shares doled out, blinds the worker to the
fact that he has no say in running the plant.</em></p>

<p>If ownership does not necessarily imply control, what is control?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>How Do Capitalists Control Industry?</h4>

<p class="fst">In order to control a firm, the group of Capitalists at its head
need know nothing about it. The <strong>Manchester Guardian</strong> reported
an analysis of 725 public companies, comprising about four-fifths of
Britain&#8217;s engineering output. It showed that over two-thirds of the
Directors have no professional qualification and that 40 per cent of
the companies&#8217; Boards have no technically qualified Director. Yet
in the last 50 years the proportion of chartered engineers to the
working population has increased fourfold. One only need add that a
large proportion of Company Directors are themselves paid hacks of
the really big investors, chosen for their know-how, to see how
little Capitalists need know about industry.</p>

<p>The actual running of the firms is in the hands of paid managers
and salaried technical staffs who have no say in &#8220;policy&#8221;. And
yet, although all the &#8220;know-how&#8221; is hired, the control still lies
in the hands of the non-professional directors. What is this control?</p>

<p><em>The Directors have the power of hiring and firing.</em></p>

<p>Although they know nothing about the actual process of production,
they can tell a man who does by his record. If a manager produces a
10 per cent profit when every other company is raking in 20 per cent,
that manager gets the sack. If he produces 20 per cent while others
produce 10 per cent, every firm competes to employ him. The same goes
for the rest of the technical and professional staff &#8211; they are
hired and fired on the basis of their formal qualifications and on
the basis of results which every man in the street can see. Very
little training in arithmetic is needed to see the difference between
20 per cent and 10 per cent.</p>

<p>What gives the Capitalists the power to hire and fire their
managers? The law courts, police, prisons and the army &#8211; the whole
apparatus of repression which is the Capitalist State. If the
managers should do the impossible and refuse to leave his office,
he&#8217;d find himself behind bars in no time. If workers should again
do what they&#8217;ve done so many times before and conduct a sit-down
strike, they would find troops banging at the gates within an hour.</p>

<p>Capitalists control industry, not by their superior knowledge, but
by their monopoly of armed power (ably abetted by their control of
the press, the radio, television, films and the other &#8220;idea-fixing&#8221; industries).<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What Capitalists Can Do, Workers Can Do Better</h4>

<p class="fst">When the workers take power in Britain, we can expect very little
damage in the basic economic facts of the country. True, most
industries will be nationalized sooner or later by the Workers&#8217;
State. True, the struggle for the Workers&#8217; State will take the form
of trades councils, factory and shop committees mobilizing the
workers to eject the capitalist owners. But capitalist owners, as the
experience of nationalization in Britain and Russia shows, are not
absolutely necessary to capitalism. Given State power the
technicians, managers and bureaucrats can very easily perform the
functions of the capitalist, even better than he can.</p>

<p>Yes, the Workers&#8217; State will inherit very many features of
capitalism. Managers and technical experts will remain, and our
ignorance, for which we have to thank the capitalist world in which
we were brought up and which places the technocrats at such an
advantage, will remain with us too. Possibly a whole generation will
have to pass before this class difference between mental and manual
labour disappears for ever.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>How to control the technicians</h4>

<p class="fst">In the meantime our main job inside the country (ignoring defence
from external attack for the moment) will be to guard against the
middle-class &#8220;technocrats&#8221; becoming an independent body with
armed powers of their own. This must be done in two ways: <em>the job
of hiring and firing technical and managerial experts must be in the
hands of elected shop and factory committees</em> with the power of
striking against any sabotage or breach of faith on the part of these
technocrats. Second, <em>these committees and regional trades councils
must have the full support of the Workers&#8217; State.</em> No separate
bodies of armed men but the entire people armed.</p>

<p>Given these two conditions, the technocrats will obey the workers
as they have always obeyed the capitalists.</p>
