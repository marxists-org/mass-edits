<p class="fst">FOR TOO MANY YEARS now the opposition to the right-wing leadership
in the trade-union movement has come from King Street. On a national
level the only alternative to the Carrons and Williamsons has been
the Birches and the Haxells. Militants in industry have usually had
to choose between them, for lack of an independent Left lead.</p>

<p>But times have changed. Once again it is feasible to discuss the
possibility of building such a movement in the trade unions. Why
should militants like MacLoughlin of Briggs he compelled to remain in
the CP against their will because, as he puts it, &#8220;the Labour Party
has not got ... factory organization.&#8221;</p>

<p>The monolithic front of the right wing &#8211; personified until
recently by Deakin, Lawther, Lincoln Evans and their like &#8211; has
shown some cracks &#8211; witness the recent struggles of (and within)
the Confederation of Ship building and Engineering Unions. These are
only small cracks, mind, but they show that the Right is becoming
ruffled and losing its grip.</p>

<p>The CP also has lost ground despite Gollan and Co&#8217;s assertions
that the upheavals in that party affected a bunch of knock-kneed
intellectuals only. MacLoughlin is but one of many CPers in industry
who have expressed disgust with their party. If that were not so, why
on earth could Etheridge, Stalinist convener at Austins for many
years, not muster more than 800-odd votes against right-wing
candidate Cresswell&#8217;s 3,600 in the recent elections for AEU
District Organizer in the Birmingham area? If it weren&#8217;t for their
loss of support in industry, why should the industrial branches have
made such a poor showing at the CP&#8217;s London May Day procession this
year? Or Birch and Co. been so roundly defeated at the AEU National Committee?</p>

<p><em>The Right is organized on the shop floor. The CP is organized.
Even the Catholics are organized in an Association of Catholic Trade
Unionists. But the independent Left is not.</em></p>

<p>The difficulties are still tremendous, although the opportunities
are greater than they have been for some time. But if we are going to
get anywhere in the direction of a genuine Left-wing poky
uncontaminated by the bureaucracies of Transport House or King
Street, we have to start now, from below. Left trade-unionists have a
job to hand: building Labour Groups in the factories.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">MR. CHARLES J. GEDDES is a dangerous man. He himself is harmless
but the ideas he represents could be ruinous to the trade-union
Movement if they were adopted.</p>

<p>The Tory Minister of Labour has embraced avidly an idea suggested
by the courts of inquiry into the ship-building and engineering
disputes &#8211; the idea of &#8220;an authoritative and impartial body&#8221; to
determine a national wages policy. The courts of inquiry themselves
must have got the idea from somewhere, and this is where Geddes comes in.</p>

<p>In 1954, while he was still secretary of the Union of Post Office
Workers, he served as a member of a similar court of inquiry. That
was where the scheme first bounced up. Today, having more time to
deal with labour policy as a whole (he has left his secretaryship) &#8211;
and having once again been a member of the courts of inquiry in the
recent dispute, up pops the same suggestion, only this time it has
all the trimmings designed to placate, other union leaders who
rejected it before.</p>

<p><em>What a national wages policy means in our present system is
simply another attempt to disarm the workers of their only effective
weapon &#8211; strike action. The bosses tell their government that
strikes are wasteful, that they cut into profits, that they harm the
&#8220;nation&#8217;s&#8221; economy and that, therefore, they should be curbed
and replaced by friendly discussions around the bargaining table.
They turn to the union leaders that are frightened to see their funds
dissipated through strikes, that exist by virtue of the fact that
they can &#8220;compose&#8221; differences between bosses and workers, and
show how easy it is to add to their statesmanlike glory by sitting on
yet another permanent body, above and apart from the turmoil of
industrial struggles.</em></p>

<p>And of course bosses, government and trade-union bureaucrats are
all, agog with this newly-found constitutional device which promises
to chain us firmly to &#8220;industrial peace.&#8221; Except that in the case
of the last-mentioned &#8211; the trade-union bureaucrats &#8211; there is a
nauseating feeling, that may be this time they will be going a bit
too far if they accept, maybe their long-suffering membership will
react to this slap in the face.</p>

<p>In its usual gentle way, the <strong>Railway Review</strong> has warned the
trade-union leadership what it can expect if it follows Geddes advice
and accepts the plan. &#8220;The consequence of that stripping of the
trade power,&#8221; it writes editorially (May 10th), &#8220;would so
emasculate them that they would in fact cease to earn the allegiance
of their members.&#8221;</p>
