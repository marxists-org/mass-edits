<p class="fst"><strong>EVER since the Tory victory last May, the capitalists have been
on the warpath. Prices have risen steadily although &#8211; as the TUC
budget statement pointed out in November &#8211; the terms of trade have
been favourable. Taxes which were given away to Big Business in the
spring pre-election budget were taken back from the working class in
the autumn post-election one. Council-house rents have been raised
and council-house building cut. Tenants in private houses are
threatened by changes in the Rent Acts. Comprehensive schools have
been strangled and working class children forced into the dead-end
Secondary Modern Schools. And, most dangerous of all, open war has
been declared in the factories.</strong></p>

<p>The Tories have not had it their own way entirely. The bosses have
had to act warily. Each move has been resisted in the workshop. We
have only to remember the two rail strikes, the strikes of the
dockers and the miners and, most recent of all, the vigorous action
taken by aircraft workers in Blackpool (Hawker Siddeley) and Scotland
(Rolls-Royce) to see that.</p>

<p>But the fact remains that it has been the Capitalist class that
has led the attacks, and not the workers. The Bosses have held the
initiative and have hardened until, as in the case of Rolls, they
refused to accept one of the bases of unionism &#8211; the closed shop.
Why is this? What has let the initiative slip from the shop floor to
the boardroom?</p>

<p>The function of leadership is to give clear direction to a force
that already exists. Leadership means nothing without the rank and
file; but once the rank and file is mobilized it can be of decisive importance.</p>

<p>Now, what leadership has been given in the fight against the
Tories? Morrison has been trying to teach the capitalists by example,
telling them to take a leaf out of the American bosses&#8217; book and
&#8220;to recognise ... the right of the trade union leaders to be
brought into consultation&#8221; (Speech at the Oxford University Labour
Club, reported in the <strong>Times</strong>, November 10, 1955).</p>

<p>The trade union leaders themselves have confined themselves to
gently admonishing the Tory Government for going too far and telling
it that if it listened the TUC would also bear its share of the
&#8220;burden.&#8221; To quote the <strong>Times</strong> again the TUC statement on
the economic situation and the supplementary budget &#8220;opened with
the observation that it was the Government&#8217;s duty to do all they
could to preserve a balance between competing demands on the nation&#8217;s
resources but that trade unions, employers, and other sections of the
community must also play their part&#8221; (November 24, 1955). In other
words, if the Tories and their capitalist bosses would only tone down
their demands, the TUC leadership would be happy to go along with
them. In fact, they are willing to show their faith by attacking
savagely the &#8220;irresponsible elements within our own ranks,&#8221; to
quote Tom O&#8217;Brien (<strong>Tribune</strong>, November 18, 1955), by which
they mean the militants on the shop floor who have resisted the Tory attacks.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Brien complains that &#8220;The Government has created a climate
in industry that places the (right-wing leadership of the) trade
unions ... in an impossible position.&#8221; Of course the right wing
leadership is in an impossible position. There have been no lockouts
of any size, there has been no wage-cutting in the bosses&#8217; attack.
The attack has been mainly through inflation and through the Tory
budgets. Monopoly capitalism where the economic strength and the
political pull are in so few hands, has no need to use the crude
obvious frontal attack on the working class.</p>

<p>The monopolists can get together after a successful wage claim and
agree to raise their prices and keep them there without competing
amongst themselves. They can get their government to tax the workers
in order to cover tax concessions to themselves. Monopoly capitalism
uses political action or economic action indiscriminately, choosing
whichever one will serve it best at any time.</p>

<p>If the right-wing leadership of the TUC and the Labour Party do
not do the same, they will remain in an impossible position. Their
trouble is that they do not. They are willing to shout about the
budget in Parliament, but unwilling to appeal to industrial action to
offset its effect. They are willing &#8211; sometimes &#8211; to strike
against an individual capitalist but unwilling to strike again the
whole capitalist class in the form of formulating a political
programme for Socialism. And when the rank and file step ahead of
their &#8220;leaders and show up Tory politics by taking industrial
action, the right-wing leadership attacks it as &#8220;selfish and
&#8220;irresponsible.&#8221; For, if once the rank and file proves to itself
that its political strength lies in its economic strength, the end of
capitalism will be very near, and the bureaucratic labour leaders
whose job it is to look after the workers&#8217; interest <em>within</em>
the capitalist system will be without a job, as the capitalist system
which houses them will be on its way to destruction.</p>

<p>The rank and file cannot take this situation lying down. We cannot
fight the Tories if we do not use our main strength &#8211; industrial
action and industrial solidarity. We cannot fight if we are kept in
the dark about the intimate connection between the political action
and the industrial action taken by the Monopolies and their
Governmental Butlers.</p>

<p>We must learn this connection. We must learn how each event in the
political world is effecting us in the factories; how each act in the
factories has repercussions in the political world. Only on the basis
of such knowledge will we be able to use our resources effectively to
repel the Tory attack whether it is made in a political guise or an
industrial one.</p>

<p>The best way of gaining such knowledge and of acting on it, the
best way of directing ourselves is by forming Labour Party Groups
within the shops and factories. These Groups would keep up a running
commentary on the industrial implications of political changes and
would know when to take industrial action. They would, on the basis
of their experience, build a firm programme for the transition to
Socialism, a programme which could attract the many non-politicals in
the factories to the fight for concrete day-to-day demands and which
would put pressure on the right-wing leadership of the Party and the
TUC to either expose themselves or to fight for these demands.</p>

<p>The importance of such groups is not to be measured by their size.
We know that the Capitalist Press believes all shop-stewards to be
members of the Communist Party, that even Tom O&#8217;Brien believes that
fifty per cent of them are. But we also know that the actual number
of Communist Party members is very small (the price they pay for
years of inconsistency and betrayals). However, they work as an
organized group, the only organized group, and so influence a greater
number of rank-and-filers than would be the case if there was an
alternative and Socialist grouping. Labour Party Groups could be the
alternative, hammering out a consistent Socialist policy without
strings attached.</p>
