<p class="fst"><strong>Automation, according to an acknowledged expert on the subject,
&#8220;provides the answer to the human problem of machine pacing and
subordination of the worker to the machine.&#8221; So it does when there
is full automation. But where automation is partially applied pace
setting becomes even worse than before.</strong></p>

<p>Automation integrates the whole plant into one continuous process.
&#8220;The rate of output will be decided by managements on technical
grounds, and it will be controlled by technicians rather than
operators,&#8221; write the Department for Scientific and Industrial
Research in their official publication on the subject. Where there
are gaps in automation, for example where an operator does repetitive
work between two automatic machines which require work to be removed
and fed at fixed intervals, the operator must work at the pace set by
the whole line.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Same Old Problem</h4>

<p class="fst">This problem exists in any production line. &#8220;But in an automatic
factory,&#8221; says Diebold, the expert quoted above, &#8220;the
synchronization of the machines and of the machine output is
critical. For an automatic factory it is vital that a continual and
uninterrupted rate of progress be established and sustained.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Machines Crack the Whip</h4>

<p class="fst">We have experience of what this means in practice. In the Ford
plant at Dagenham, Essex, &#8220;the operator on a transfer-line is
usually paid in the same way as other semi-skilled men&#8221; but, says
the DSIR publication, he &#8220;has more to think about than the operator
of an individual machine-tool. His actions are more varied and
continuous; he may cover more ground, has more points to watch, and
must react more promptly.&#8221;</p>

<p>But automation does not only mean speed-up by the way. It is used
consciously to cut down waiting time even where conventional machines
are used. The Potter Instrument Company in the US recently announced
the production of a small computer that can be attached to any
machine. &#8220;Used to study frequency-changing combinations of
automatic machine cycles,&#8221; states the announcement, &#8220;it
calculates the production on each machine of a group and <em>the
waiting time during which the operator is not loading any machine</em>.&#8221;
Stripped of the technical jargon, it means that speeds and
piece-rates would have to be argued with an electronic brain instead
of with human management snoops.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Seven Minutes Saved</h4>

<p class="fst">Nothing as mass produced has appeared yet in this country but
Brook Motors Ltd., of Huddersfield, have installed a device in their
Barugh Green plant near Barnsley called &#8216;the Brain&#8217;. It &#8220;is
operated by one girl and yet <em>controls</em> about 250 women workers.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Under the old system,&#8221; states a report in the
January issue of <strong>Automation Age</strong>, &#8220;... when a winder has
finished a job, she had to report to the production control office
and wait an average of seven minutes before she could be provided
with the materials required for the next job.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Now there is no waiting. When one of the 250 winders
has finished a job, a red flash appears on the panel of &#8216;the
Brain&#8217;, which is being controlled by a girl, the girl passes an
order and presses a button for a green light to appear ...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">And the materials are delivered instantly. The boss has saved
seven minutes; the workers have sweated a little more.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Factory-Wide Bargaining</h4>

<p class="fst">As pace-setting becomes more and more a function for the plant
engineers who can, because of the integration of the whole plant into
one continuous process, determine the rhythm of work in the entire
factory, the individual worker becomes less and less able to set his
own work-pace. Even the single shop or section loses its power to
adjust speeds. Speeds become a factory affair which must be made
subject to factory-wide bargaining between workers and management.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Workers&#8217; Control</h4>

<p class="fst">In this, American workers have had more experience than we. They
have also made greater gains than we have. In an epic 22-week strike
at Westinghouse on the issue of piece-work and production standards,
the International Union of Electrical Workers broke the management&#8217;s
prerogative to decide <em>unilaterally</em> that each worker <em>must</em>
produce a given number of pieces a day or face suspension or the
sack. Since March, 1956, all disputed piece rates and speeds have
been the subject of arbitration by the union.</p>

<p>Although this is not complete workers&#8217; control of speeds it is a
step towards it. It shows the way to workers&#8217; control of
production. It is an essential first defence against capitalist automation.</p>

<p>We must have full workers&#8217; control of speeds.</p>
