<h1>Withdraw the Troops from Cyprus!</h1>

<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Review</strong>, <a href="../../../../../history/etol/newspape/soc-rev-srg/index.html#sr56_08" target="new">Vol.&nbsp;5 No.&nbsp;11</a>, August 1956, p.&nbsp;3.<br />

<p class="fst"><strong>THE FILTHY WAR in Cyprus drags on. British troops are detailed
to fight children as can be seen in the photograph on this page. The
country is steadily impoverished as houses are torn down, forests
burn and collective fines are imposed on the villagers. And our own
national servicemen are faced with a senseless death in the service
of profits.</strong></p>

<p>We haven&#8217;t got to seek far for confirmation. It is not so long
ago that Eden, in an unwonted burst of rhetoric, revealed the truth
in the House of Commons. &#8220;Above all, oil,&#8221; he said. And since
then, the theme has been taken up again and again.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>An Oily Excuse</h4>

<p class="fst">Speaking at Barry, South Wales, the Foreign Secretary Selwyn
Lloyd, made the message as plain as can be: &#8220;our country&#8217;s
industrial life and that of Western Europe depend to-day, and will
depend on many years to come, on oil supplies from the Middle East.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If those resources were to be in peril, we should have
to defend them. The facilities we have in Cyprus are part of that
defence. We cannot, therefore, accept any doubt about their
availability. We shall continue to strive for a settlement.&#8221; And
that settlement means the restoration of &#8220;law and order&#8221; on the
island. (Reported in the <strong>Observer</strong>, July 8, 1956.)</p>

<p class="fst">But is oil a sufficient reason in itself? We import a lot of
Danish bacon, eggs and butter, and yet the British army is not
occupying Denmark. Half our food and most of our raw materials come
from overseas and yet in most cases the British army is not required
to direct the traffic.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Oil Profits &#8211; The Key</h4>

<p class="fst">It cannot be oil alone. What is driving the Tory Government is the
defence of <em>oil profits</em>. The oil monopolies think that the time
has come to show a firm hand. They dare not allow Iraq, for example,
become another Persia. It&#8217;s not only that they might lose a lot of
income as the Anglo-Iranian Petroleum Company did, but that the
American oil monopolists might nibble more of their British friends&#8217;
pastures in the Middle East &#8211; more than they did in Persia.</p>

<p>The Tories are doing their best to guarantee these oil profits by
retaining. Cyprus as a base from which to threaten the Middle East.
But they have attempted more than they can manage. The Labour Party
leadership sees this and offers them an alternative. Not, of course,
an alternative policy but an alternative tactic. And Bevan, who is
now the Party spokesman on Colonial Affairs, was the one to advance
that alternative in Parliament. If we can&#8217;t have &#8220;Cyprus as a
base,&#8221; let us at least have &#8220;a base on Cyprus.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is no alternative to the Tories&#8217; Policy. Bevan and the
Labour Party leadership might be shocked at the monopolists&#8217; war in
Cyprus. But all they offer is a monopolists&#8217; peace in Cyprus. They
refuse to admit that the war in Cyprus is only one incident in the
game of profit-making and international competition and that as long
as these exist war and peace are just two interchangeable weapons in
the monopolists&#8217; arsenal.</p>

<p>British and Cypriot workers are laid low in order to keep profits
high. The only way the war can be ended is by a <em>complete
withdrawal at of troops from Cyprus</em>.</p>
