<p class="fst">THE <strong>Observer</strong> reports &#8220;intense controversy and argument
within the Cabinet about the proposed anti-monopoly Bill.&#8221; What
this means is that the Tory government is under pressure from its two
supporting pillars: Big Business who supply the money and the policy,
and Small Business who supply a lot of the votes.</p>

<p>Small Business doesn&#8217;t like Big Business: Big on the other hand
thinks Small a nuisance. Big wants a Monopolies Bill that is tight
enough to smash Small&#8217;s only defence against Big, i.e. restrictive
practices and selling arrangements. Small wants a Bill that will
allow it to continue to stave off the day when Big will gobble it up.
But both members of the Business family, Small and Big, know that no
Monopolies Bill can do anything to break the really big capitalist giants.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Attempt at Suppression</h4>

<p class="fst">One recent example will show how immune the big monopolists really
are, or rather how they tell their Tory friends what to do. On
November 10, Arthur Holt, Labour MP for Bolton West, asked
Thorneycroft, Tory President of the Board of Trade, about alleged
suppressions in the Monopolies Commission&#8217;s report on the supply of
pneumatic tyres. Thorneycroft admitted that &#8220;I have had
representations made to me by the tyre manufacturers asking me to
exercise certain parts of the report ... on grounds of national
interest&#8221; (<strong>Hansard</strong>, 10th November, 1955).</p>

<p>Ignoring the fact that the big tyre and rubber firms &#8211; Dunlop,
Firestone, Goodyear and Michelin &#8211; are all either Anglo-American or
Anglo-French concerns and thus strange guardians of the &#8220;national
interest,&#8221; it is very interesting that pressure was put on the
Government man to attempt to cut out parts of the Monopolies
Commission&#8217;s report at exactly the same time as the companies
mentioned combined to form a single &#8211; and only &#8211; company for the
manufacture of synthetic rubber, aptly called the International
Synthetic Rubber Company, Ltd.</p>

<p>But if Big Business and Small Business have competing interests in
some aspects of the Monopolies Bill, they are united on one thing.
They are both firmly opposed to having any &#8220;outsiders&#8221; on the
Tribunal which will judge cases of monopoly. Whatever the private
quarrels within the Business family, the family must present a united
front to the workers. And who best defend property in our &#8220;property
owning democracy&#8221; if not the lawyers?</p>

<p>The <strong>Observer</strong> special correspondent writes, &#8220;organised
capital &#8211; notably the National Union of Manufacturers and the
Associated British Chambers of Commerce &#8211; strongly favour a
tribunal composed either exclusively or at least predominantly of
lawyers. Their reasons are transparent, for the whole British legal
tradition for more than 50 years has been to give a free hand to all
restrictive agreements, even when harmful to consumers and
competitors ...&#8221; (November 27, 1955).<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>How It Works</h4>

<p class="fst">Big (monopoly) Business certainly has a large business: it tells
Ministers what to publish and what to suppress; it tells Parliament
what laws to pass and how; it tells the law courts how to judge it if
the first two slip up now and again. At school we were taught that
democracy meant the independence of the three branches of government,
legislature, executive and judiciary. Under capitalism, it seems they
can be independent only if they are dependent on one boss &#8211; Big
(Monoply) Business.</p>
