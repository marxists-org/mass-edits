<p class="fst"><strong>BRITISH IMPERIALISM moved into Cyprus in 1878 &#8220;for two
reasons (a) as a prelude to the ... extension of British control in
the Near East and (b) as a naval and military base ... it was to be a
British <em>place d&#8217;armes</em> in the Eastern Mediterranean&#8221;.
(Doros Alastoss, <em>Cyprus: Past and Future</em>) But Cyprus was not
used for those purposes until very recently, for, in 1882, British
Imperialism occupied Egypt &#8211; a much better base, closer to the main
shipping routes, more accessible to the centres of interest in the
Middle East itself.</strong></p>

<p>Following the occupation of Egypt, the Imperialists lost much of
their interest in Cyprus. The Under-Secretary for the Colonies,
Winston Churchill, could thus afford to say in the Legislative
Council in Cyprus (1907):</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I think it is only natural that the Cypriot people who
are of Greek descent should regard their incorporation with what may
be called their mother-country as an ideal to be earnestly, devoutly
and fervently cherished.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">In 1915 Cyprus was actually offered to Greece in an attempt to
bribe her to enter the war. The offer was refused by the anti-war
Zaimes Government and Cyprus was retained in British hands. It was to
be held in reserve as a possible supplement to the Egyptian base and,
if the worst came to the worst for British Imperialism, as an
alternative to it.</p>

<p>The inevitable happened. British colonialism was forced out or
Egypt. The Egyptian base lost its value and once again Cyprus was the
only base in the area. As Colonial Secretary, Oliver Lyttleton, said
(August 8th, 1954):</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Eastern Mediterranean security demands that we
maintain sovereign power in Cyprus ... I can imagine no more
disastrous policy for Cyprus than to hand it over to a friendly but
unstable power. It would have the effect of undermining the eastern
bastion of NATO.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Cyprus soon showed its usefulness. When British troops were
involved in the oil companies&#8217; war in the Buraimi Oasis in Arabia
last year, the garrison in Cyprus was held as the ultimate sanction.
When the Jordanian population upset Anglo-American plans to force
Jordan into the Bagdad Pact (December 1955&#8211;January 1956),
parachutists were flown from Britain to Cyprus in readiness for a
showdown with the &#8220;ally&#8221;.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>How the Cypriot Workers Live</h4>

<p class="fst">CYPRUS is definitely useful to British Imperialism. But the
advantages are not reciprocated. On the contrary, the half-million
Cypriots, or at least the Greek majority which forms over four-fifths
of the population, are determined to get rid of British rule
immediately. The official <strong>Cyprus Annual Report for 1954</strong>, the
last available, tells us why.</p>

<p>Although, as can be expected in an economy dependent on imports
for much of its food and most of its other essentials, prices in
Cyprus are very much the same as in Britain, wages are far below.
Average weekly earnings, including overtime payments, bonuses, etc.
range from 42s.&nbsp;8d. in agriculture (the lowest) to 88s.&nbsp;2d. in
transport and communications (the highest) while mining averages
85s.&nbsp;4d., engineering 64s.&nbsp;8d., clothing 56s.&nbsp;5d, and
so on. The <strong>Report</strong> shows that girls under 18 work as miners
(averaging 50s.&nbsp;3d. a week) while the relatively high take-home
pay in transport and communications might have a lot to do with the
66 hour week worked by bus, lorry and taxi-drivers and by porters.</p>

<p>The Report states that education is not compulsory. The normal
school-leaving age for the children that do attend school is 12
although &#8220;in the poorer rural communities children are sometimes
taken away at the age of 9 or 10 to help their parents at home or in
the fields&#8221;. More than 50 per cent of the schools have only one
teacher who thus handles all 6 classes while another 25 per cent have
two teachers each of whom takes 3 classes.</p>

<p>The <strong>Housing Census of 1946</strong> showed that more than one-third
of the urban dwellings in the whole island consisted of one room
only. One-third of these were occupied by 7 or more persons while the
average number of persons per room over the whole island was more
than three-and-a-half. Only half the houses have piped water while
less than one-fifth have water flush sanitation (quoted in Thomas
Anthem, <strong>Enosis</strong>).</p>

<p>The transfer of the British base from Egypt only aggravates the
situation. The <strong>Annual Report</strong> states that &#8220;House building is
taking place fast, but the emphasis is on the erection of high value
buildings. Impetus has been given to this trend by the hope of
contracting leases at high rents from service personnel and others
transferred from Egypt&#8221;. As a result of this building boom &#8220;the
prices asked (for land) are so high that the middle and lower income
groups have great difficulty in finding the means both to acquire
sites and to build&#8221;.</p>

<p>Finally, every protest against these conditions has led &#8211; ever
since the emergency decrees of 1931 &#8211; to ever-increasing autocracy
on the part of the British Govenor. The worse the conditions become
the greater the protest, the greater the protest the more do the
dictatorial powers of the British Governor increase, and the more
that happens the more embittered becomes the struggle for
independence on the part of the Greek Cypriots.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Archbishop and AKEL Sell-Out</h4>

<p class="fst">THAT the Cypriots want to unite with Greece is understandable.
Eighty per cent of them speak Greek as their native tongue. But that
is not the whole reason for their desire for unity for the same
reason that a common language is not enough for us to demand
recognition as the forty-ninth state of USA.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Hope for support</h4>

<p class="fst">The main reason for <em>enosis</em> &#8211; union with Greece &#8211; is the
feeling of powerlessness when faced with the might of the British
Empire. If the Greek Cypriots declare for independence &#8211; neither
London nor Athens but an independent Cyprus &#8211; they cannot hope for
support with arms supplies or through diplomatic channels from
anywhere. If they, however, ally themselves with Greece &#8211; military
dictatorship through it be &#8211; they need not fear isolation in their
struggle with British imperialism. They would gain an interested ally
&#8211; an expansionist Greece.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Temporal dictatorship</h4>

<p class="fst">The Greek Orthodox Church in Cyprus has taken advantage of this
desire to find allies at all costs and has taken charge of the
movement for <em>enosis</em>. Like all organised religion it has no
objection to temporal dictatorship whether military or otherwise and
would prefer a Greek dictatorship in which the Church has a
recognised and privileged part to play to a British one in which it
is not a highly-prized part of the organs of government.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Stalinists and Church</h4>

<p class="fst">The Cypriot Communist Party has also jumped on the band-wagon of
the popular mass movement, playing driver&#8217;s mate to Archbishop
Makarios. After all, <em>enosis</em> threatens to disrupt the relations
between Britain, Greece and Turkey &#8211; all members of NATO. So it is
that although as recently as March 1952, AKEL (the Communist Party)
led a demonstration &#8220;to protest against the executions of
Beloyannis and other Greek Patriots by the monarcho-fascist
Government in Greece&#8221;. (<strong>Daily Worker</strong>, April 15th, 1952)<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Fascist regime of Greece</h4>

<p class="fst">The monarcho-fascist regime has since been forgotten and the
Political Committee of the Communist Party can &#8220;support the right
of the Cypriot people to self-determination and union with Greece&#8221;
(<strong>Daily Worker</strong>, August 6th, 1954) without mentioning the fact
that the Greece they desire to unite with still has not released the
thousands of political prisoners, including their own comrades, from
prison and concentration camps. Indeed, although the <strong>Daily Worker</strong>
considered not so long ago (October 28th, 1952) that &#8220;Greece today
is an occupied country ... (and) ... a monarcho-fascist regime&#8221;, it
has since compromised so much with <em>enosis</em> as even to appeal to
support the present regime and to issue &#8220;a grave warning to beware
the danger of a militarist fascist coup&#8221; (November 23rd, 1954)
which most people thought had occurred a long time ago.</p>
<p>As Socialists we cannot blind ourselves to the nature of the
present regime in Greece nor to the danger for the organised workers
of Cyprus implicit in <em>enosis</em>. We cannot subordinate the
interests of the people of Cyprus to momentary expediency.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Slogan of weakness</h4>

<p class="fst">On the other hand we cannot ignore the obvious desire of the Greek
population of Cyprus for <em>enosis</em>, union with Greece. However,
we must realise that as long as the Cypriots feel isolated and
without allies in their struggle against British Imperialism, <em>enosis</em>,
although it means union with a military dictatorship, although it
means the growth in influence of an obscurantist Church and an
opportunist Party (the C.P.) , will appear as the only hope. <em>Enosis</em>
is a slogan of weakness.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>British workers hold key</h4>

<p class="fst">The Cypriot people can attain real independence only if they find
an ally in their struggle against British Imperialism. An ally
without ulterior motive. That ally should be the British working
class. By weakening Capitalism at home we weaken Imperialism abroad.</p>

<p><em>We can give the Cypriot people the help they need by demanding
the withdrawal of British troops from the colonies, freedom for the
colonies and the offer of technical and economic assistance to them.</em></p>
