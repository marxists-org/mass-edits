<h3>The Presence of the Future</h3>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<h1>Extract 9 &ndash; Coda:The Evolution Game<br />
(Consciousness <em>v.</em> Extrapolation)</h1>

<p class="fst">The game is about survival and the moral choices that underlie it.</p>

<p>The game lasts about forty minutes.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Components</h4>

<ul>
<li>160 playing cards divided into 112 <em><strong>Prompt</strong></em> cards <strong>(</strong>covering environmental, social and technical events, real or anticipated) and 48 <em><strong>Choice</strong></em> cards (32 <em><strong>jokers</strong></em> which are used strategically, 12 <em><strong>neutralizers</strong></em> which nullify the effect of any other card when invoked, and 4 <em><strong>terminators</strong></em>, which end the game forthwith)<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>A supply of <em><strong>Academy tokens</strong></em> (50 ones, 20 tens, 20 hundreds, and 1 thousand)<br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h4>Players</h4>

<p class="fst">The game can be played by any number (although four is optimum).</p>

<p>Players divide (by lot, consensus or fiat) into:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Biches</em> (representing big, rich countries) endowed with 100 million people and 1,000 academies;<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li><em>Boors</em> (big, poor countries) with 100 million people and 100 academies;<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li><em>Smiches</em> (small, rich countries) with 20 million people and 100 academies; and<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li><em>Smoors</em> (small, poor countries) with 20 million people and 10 academies.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h4>Setup</h4>

<p class="fst">Shuffle the <em>cards</em> and place them <em>face downwards</em> on a central deck.</p>

<p>Players take their quota of <em>tokens</em> from the <em>Chest</em>, always keeping them visible to all.</p>

<p>Bich opens the game, followed by the player to the left. Later rounds are opened by players in the same sequence.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Play</h4>

<p class="fst">Each player in turn takes a card from the central deck. If it is a <em>Prompt</em> card <em>the player reads it aloud</em> and all follow its instructions (by taking <em>tokens</em> from the Chest or returning them to it). If a player takes a <em>Choice</em> card it is played when the player deems it expedient to do so.</p>

<p>Once used a card is returned to the bottom of the deck.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Course of the game</h4>

<p class="fst">The game consists of several rounds in each of which the number of a player&rsquo;s <em>Academies</em> changes, and with it the balance between <em>Population</em> and <em>Academies</em>. This balance can move towards or away from the <em>Critical Ratio</em> when a player makes the transition to <em>ecological society</em>. If any one player makes that transition, all win.</p>

<p>Players can influence each other&rsquo;s movement towards or away from the <em>Critical Ratio</em> by the use to which they put their <em>choice cards</em>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Aim of the game</h4>

<p class="fst">The aim of the game is to increase the ratio of <em>Academies</em> to <em>Population</em>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>End of the game</h4>

<p class="fst">The game can be won in either of two ways: by achieving a <em>one win</em> situation in which all other players are forced to drop out (when the number of his or her <em>Academies</em> falls below half the <em>starting position</em>, namely below 500 for a Bich, 50 for a Smich, 50 for a Boor, and 5 for a Smoor. (The assets of the dropout are then divided equally amongst the survivors) Or by contriving an <em>all win</em> situation, <em>Academies</em> to <em>Population</em> for any one player doubles, i.e. when the number of <em>Academies</em> reaches 2,000 for a Bich, 200 for a Boor, 200 for a Smich, or 20 for a Smoor.</p>

<p>There is also an abort situation in which <em>all lose</em> (when a <em>terminator</em> card is drawn and not neutralized).<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Winner</h4>

<p class="fst">Depending on the way the game ends, the winner is either a standalone &lsquo;me&rsquo; who has to entertain the other players (with a round of something &ndash; a restaurant meal, or an exotic weekend in Bangkok or Birmingham) as the price of victory, or a convivial &lsquo;us&rsquo; who share the costs of mutual entertainment.</p>
