<p class="fst">Two hundred years ago the personal columns of newspapers read by
the literate middle class stressed the most general social and
personal characteristics of the advertiser and of the prospective
respondent. From <strong>The Times</strong> (London), Tuesday, 15 December,
1801: &#8216;Gentleman (a Bachelor), about 26 ... man of good property,
agreeable person, and in an old-established profitable Business ...
Any Lady (Widow or Spinster) not exceeding 30 years of age&#8217;; or,
from <strong>The Times</strong>, Wednesday, 28 December, 1803: &#8216;A Tradesman,
in a pleasant part of London wishes to meet with a Partner for Life
... an agreeable, prudent Person; a Widow would not be objected to if
her age did not much exceed his own which is under 30. Some fortune
is expected&#8217;.</p>

<p>Today the typical advertiser concentrates on his or her singular
characteristics, idiosyncratic proclivities, desires, interests,
passions, hates and so on, and those of the target reader. Thus, from
a recent issue of <strong>The New York Review</strong>: &#8216;loving good music,
cats, nature&#8217;, &#8216;great listener/ great lover&#8217;, &#8216;seeking
non-smoking, dynamic, sensitive, Jewish male 40&#8211;55&#8217;, &#8216;gay&#8217;,
&#8216;deep feelings for nature and expressionistic art&#8217;,
&#8216;socially/environmentally responsible, enjoys long walks, the arts,
travel, mountains, skiing&#8217;, &#8216;loves to travel, go for walks, and
have good conversations&#8217;, &#8216;attracted to Moroccan pillows&#8217;.</p>

<p>In two hundred years personal advertisers made the passage from
representing themselves in terms of a wider social identity (a
lineage or family, an occupation), through presenting themselves as
individual personalities, increasingly free of a social dimension,
to, finally, presenting themselves as a collection of attributes or
characteristics without a unifying principle. The transition marked a
momentous change in the socio-psychological landscape of market
society as it lurched into its industrial-urban phase.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Causes</h4>

<p class="fst">Curious things happened in the course of the eighteenth century in
Europe, England in particular. The impersonal, single-shot,
single-purpose transaction between strangers which constitutes the
essence of a market broke free from age-old constraints, and took over
economic life. God began to be approached on His day, not on any
other day; the person one married was no longer a person one lived
near; the space between people became more real than the people
themselves; an &#8216;enough&#8217; society gave way to a &#8216;more&#8217;, or
&#8216;never quite enough&#8217; one.</p>

<p>The transition was catastrophic for most of those who experienced
it. Their family and social networks were torn apart. They were
detached from fixed locations and clear identities. Their material
life deteriorated. Their moral world, their understandings, their
sense of self were damaged, often beyond repair. For a few the
changes amounted to an anastrophe (&#8216;a coming together of disparate
elements to form a coherent, connected whole&#8217;). For them a new,
living creation emerged &#8211; the modern capitalist market system.
Driven by the interactions between people, rather than by individual
natures, this society became free to pursue its logic to the limits
of human capacity, and beyond. It created ever-rising standards of
performance, physical and mental &#8211; standards that few achieve, that
some approach, that many aspire to but fail to attain.</p>

<p>True, the vast mass of Market Being that resulted &#8211; average
Market Beings &#8211; are better fed, better protected against disease,
more knowledgeable, able to accomplish more than is conceivable in
any other society, past or present. The exceptional individual in our
midst would appear little short of superhuman anywhere else. But that
is not the whole story. Even the most remarkable of individuals could
not accomplish one iota of the achievements routinely expected of
ordinary Market Being &#8211; in terms of strength, speed, agility,
consistency, concentration &#8211; without help.</p>

<p>These miracles are possible because human capabilities are
augmented by machines &#8211; by desktop computers that compute at three
million times the speed of a numerically competent human, tirelessly
and with (mostly) perfect reliability; cars that typically carry
their occupants 20&#8211;30 times faster than they can walk &#8211; without
tiring; airplanes that multiply that multiple by a factor of 8 or 10.
At best a human can lift 50 kilos one metre, compared to an
earth-moving machine&#8217;s 2,700 kilos and seven metres in the same
time; a fighter can kill a handful where a nuclear weapon can wipe
out millions.</p>

<p>But these machines really confirm people in their deficiencies,
encouraging them to settle for what they can do without effort, and
result in the kind of dependence that reduced the American GI in
Vietnam to impotence: can&#8217;t move without the chopper, can&#8217;t see
without the glasses, can&#8217;t smell without the sniffer, can&#8217;t hear
without the booster, can&#8217;t sense without apparatus, adjuncts, aids.
In short, can&#8217;t live without a vast supply train &#8211; the pills, the
pre-cooked food, the ice cream. For the mass of people machines widen
the gap between the possible and the probable. What people can
accomplish themselves loses importance. People lose coherence, find
it easy to dissociate <em>persona</em> from person or even to replace a
vestigial person with many <em>personas</em>.</p>

<p>Consider the entertainment business, where self-estrangement and
self-thingification reach an apogee. Hear Arnold Schwarzenegger &#8211;
who redesigned his body, punishingly, over many years &#8211; speaking
about himself (if &#8216;self&#8217; can be said to come into it):</p>

<p class="quoteb">I know one thing. I have been very fortunate that every
year the public&#8217;s interest in me and in my films has gone up,
whatever is on the market. If it is magazine covers, they sell better
this year than last year, and last year they sold better than the
year before, so there is increase all the time. When you look at the
last five years there has been a steady increase. We hope it will
continue like that ... I really only had a plan to creating and
publicizing myself... I went to a lot of acting classes, voice
classes, accent removal classes and on and on and on. I mean I
covered myself really well.</p>

<p class="fst">The effort clearly paid off. By the mid-to-late nineties the fees
demanded by his agents started approaching the GDP of a small country.</p>

<p>Or look at Michael Jackson, constantly recreated at vast expense,
constantly remodelled, constantly mutating. Supported by a retinue of
plastic surgeons, dermatologists, hair specialists, and other
personscape artists, he produced a supremely marketable product,
neither black nor white, neither man nor woman; ageless, with
narrowed nose, straightened hair, sculpted eyebrows, bleached skin &#8211;
an embodiment of fantasy, and a far cry from the rather appealing
little boy launched into superstardom in the early seventies.</p>

<p>Schwarzenegger and Jackson are, however, only highly visible
exponents of a culture in which we permit ourselves to be treated
like commodities in the hope that we may, one day, be treated like
valuable commodities, a culture which encourages extreme
professionalization, a slide from participation to spectacle, and the
use of drugs to enhance (and recover from) performance.</p>

<p>It is a culture that supports an army of counsellors and
therapists devoted to creating &#8216;new expectations&#8217; and to
persuading people to &#8216;rethink their self-images&#8217;; that has spread
psychometric testing, adapted from educational, military and clinical
uses, to selecting applicants for almost any job; that rewards
behavioural consultants with six-figure salaries for helping managers
handle workplace relationships by projecting an acceptable image;
that brings fashion consultants and sartorial psychologists to match
dress to station (rather than to self); which divorces behaviour from
feeling (as in Tokyo&#8217;s smile classes); which supports a
multi-billion dollar market for cosmetic surgery, cosmetic products,
beauty salons, health farms, fitness centres, body shapers, exercise
instructors, cosmetic prostheses and so on, each with its magazines,
manuals, treatises and experts; and which brings a third of all
adults in Britain (41 percent of women) to try slimming at any one
time. Altogether the personal packaging business, the business of
presenting a self-other-than-self, of separating persona from person,
of constructing a presence distinct from the essence, accounts for
perhaps $200 billion in sales worldwide. And this is apart from the
huge sums spent on clothing, housing and generally providing this
persona with its accoutrements.</p>

<p>It is a culture which demands of the body, particularly the female
body, heroic feats of adaptation. The ideal figure, the one composed
by fashion designers on their drawing boards, is one that is
impossible in nature. Magazine art departments elongate necks,
enhance breasts, narrow waists. And where depiction is not enough,
the plastic surgeon is invoked: $3 billion a year was spent on some 2
million cosmetic procedures in the US alone in the early nineties,
keeping as many as 15,000 cosmetic surgeons in relative luxury. In
the early 1960s there were 108 plastic surgery clinics in Tokyo,
serving 200,000 women a year. Today South Africa is bolstering its
currency with &#8216;scalpel safaris&#8217;, in which women from Europe fly
in, have eyes and other parts lifted, get a tan while watching a wild
beast or two in a national park, and return home &#8211; all for one
third of the cost of the procedure (minus tan and tour) at home. A
recent development in the field is the adjustable breast implant,
into which silicone can be added or siphoned out, according to the
dictates of fashion or the tastes of the current partner in a woman&#8217;s life.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">The sense of self rests, ultimately, on three bases, or pillars,
which the death of subjectivity undermines.</p>

<p>First, it depends on a broad, balanced understanding of the social
and physical world, and of one&#8217;s place in it &#8211; an understanding
which can withstand the test of performance, which can therefore be
self-reinforcing and cumulative. This has been seriously weakened by
the narrowing of cognitive modes in market society. Of the four major
modes of understanding on which our sense of self is based &#8211; the
scientific, the religious, the intuitive, and the sensuous &#8211; only
the scientific has triumphed and been dignified. Exhausted it may be,
too weak to carry the full weight of traffic between society and its
environment, or between the individuals who make up society, it is
nevertheless active, powerful, and the more imposing because of its
rivals&#8217; even greater decline.</p>

<p>The second pillar of the self is the sense, based on
accomplishment, of being an autonomous agent in the world. That
sense is not encouraged by current arrangements. Natural events &#8211;
puberty, ageing, change, death and bereavement &#8211; have become the
province of specialists, consultants, counsellors. Every organ, every
biological event, every infection has its experts; health comes to
depend on drugs and specialist care. Life is medicalized; health,
illness, pregnancy, birth, sexuality, death, eating and drinking, are
standardized. We lose our capacity to take charge of our own physical
state and to face the events and trials of our own existence. We
don&#8217;t recover; we are cured. We don&#8217;t die in the natural course
of life, but are carried off by a disease in hospital, and then often
only with the doctor&#8217;s permission. Death ceases to be for amateurs:
it&#8217;s a professional business. You don&#8217;t control even the passages
of your life: surgery takes over the function of the fallopian tubes
and womb-management increases in scope.</p>

<p>This passivity is reinforced by the disconnection of most work
from a direct relationship with nature and by its migration from the
household. For most people work takes place in a dedicated workplace,
separate from social and cultural life (which also becomes the
business of specialists), separate from the household and the wider
community which it sustains, separate from everything but personal
survival. Dependency supplants agency. Loss of control over work, its
culture and hygiene, leads to a desire to avoid or escape from it
and, by a natural progression, to the development, by specialists, of
&#8216;objective&#8217;, &#8216;scientific&#8217; criteria, for &#8216;justified&#8217;
idleness and unjustified &#8216;malingering&#8217;.</p>

<p>Medicine aligns itself with school, army, and prisons, in
producing individuals adjusted, by chemical means if need be, to the
social roles assigned them: company doctors steer workers back to
jobs they cannot abide; prison and army psychiatrists try to make
prisoners and troops adjust to inhuman conditions. The loss of agency
leads to the treatment of symptoms rather than underlying causes, and
converts medical care into, ultimately, a licensed purveyor of
normative Market Being.</p>

<p>The third pillar of self &#8211; the third condition for self to exist
&#8211; is that it be recognized by others. It cannot exist without
relatedness, in two senses. To be aware of one&#8217;s self is to see
something distinct from its physical or cultural surroundings,
capable of a changing relationship; something in motion, with an
orientation which might be changing at a different pace or in a
different direction from that of its surroundings. That orientation
forms the substance of all our feelings of meaningfulness &#8211; the
deepest substratum of ethics. A condition of self &#8211; as every
physician, counsellor or priest knows &#8211; is having &#8216;something to
live for&#8217;. Second, the self cannot exist in a void &#8211; it is formed
by bonding to others from birth (gradually enlarging the &#8216;I&#8217; into
a &#8216;we&#8217; which includes the &#8216;I&#8217;, but is distinct from it). It
requires a secure base, derived in large measure from the relative
permanence of our bonds-folk and our surroundings.</p>

<p>One source of the strain on the pillars of self is the pervasive
uncertainty about where one stands, a relativism which, at best,
turns moral life into an optional extra, and at worst, into a void,
empty of purpose, experienced as a lack of reference to what is good,
significant, or meaningful. In our world, activities may have
purpose, but life no longer has. Individual lives do not assimilate
different conducts, or make sense as part of a larger entity; they
are no longer a focus of meaning. Nor is there a single entity they
might represent. You might be a paid up member of a family, a loyal
colleague at work, a dedicated fan or hobbyist, a good neighbour &#8211;
a multitude of things each of which is enmeshed in a larger entity.
But there is no compelling reason for all these connexions to coalesce.</p>

<p>Another pressure undermining the sense of self comes from the
transformation of intention into behaviour, of purpose into law,
whereby the individual is relieved of responsibility for outcomes so
long as he or she conforms.</p>

<p>The self has also suffered from increasingly rapid changes in
social and physical circumstances, which turn attachment into contact
&#8211; a superficial, evanescent thing; from the narrowing of family
relationships to the conjugal or sub-conjugal family; from
urbanization and the loss of direct links with nature, which have
dulled our sense of the uniqueness and variety of individual
constitutions, and replaced our easy acceptance of variety with
seeing it as something discordant, unnerving (and which have also
promoted a slide from strong associations through mutual stimulation,
to the weak associations of agglomeration and contiguity).</p>

<p>The weakening of self feeds back to the social detachment and
disconnectedness which are its chief cause. It occurs most easily
when the individual is denied the repeated relationships and
exchanges of community life, and is propelled into a series of
mobile, changing, revocable associations designed for highly specific
ends &#8211; a series of partial relationships.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, other people&#8217;s motives cannot be
inferred with conviction; what happens, while apparently being the
intended action of a human agent, is often unintelligible and
non-negotiable. We do not know what to make of it, how to respond to
it, how to distinguish between human responsibility and the nature of
things. It is a world of bafflement and disassociation. It is also a
world of rage, of watchfulness, of dulled enthusiasms, suspicion,
pessimism, defensiveness and quickness to take offence. In
pre-capitalist times people knew what other people thought or
believed or saw or heard &#8211; they shared common values and
assumptions, common experiences and purposes. Nowadays you don&#8217;t
know without asking. Consumer surveys, opinion polls, elections,
referenda have taken the place of shared awareness. The basis for
relatedness has moved from the unmediated and spontaneous to the
external and formally-structured.</p>

<p>One of the ways personal detachment expresses itself is in
criminal behaviour. People with little or no stake in society do not
feel bound by its rules, and may even have little idea of what they
are. A more general expression is the way people typically behave in
an urban setting. Even in a small suburb, like Nassau County in New
York, one can meet 11,000 people on the street within a ten-minute
radius; in mid-town Manhattan the figure climbs to 220,000. In these
conditions personal contacts become narrow and superficial, reduced
to formulae, measured in terms of their cost in psychic energy,
protected by inhibitory screens. Norms of non-involvement evolve to
cope with the threatened sensory overload (norms which also permit
greater tolerance of the unusual than is likely to be found in a
small community). At the extreme this moral atonality allows
indifference to homicide, or homicidal indifference, to flourish, as
when neighbours hear or even watch murder or rape without doing
anything about it.</p>

<p>Ironically, the cultivation of non-involvement leads to
understimulation and attempts to create artificially, and within a
controlled sphere, the stimuli which it denied in the first place. So
urban dwellers manufacture unnecessary problems which they then have
to, and can, solve, in games such as Scruples; they overreact to
normal stimuli by compulsive intimacy or confessionalism.</p>

<p>Another expression of personal detachment is the conversion of
normal activities into specialist &#8216;recreational&#8217; pursuits &#8211;
compulsive gratification unattenuated by contextual restraints.</p>

<p>Sex, stripped of an emotional and social setting, becomes a
mechanical pastime, repeated to the limits of physical capacity,
drained of content as a means of communication or propagation. Eating
becomes detached from energy requirements and, at the extreme, from
social intercourse, and turns into ingestion or &#8216;grazing&#8217;. Travel
ceases to be a purposeful activity, used &#8216;to regulate imagination
by reality&#8217; (as enjoined by Dr Johnson), and becomes an
accumulation of experiences divorced from everyday life &#8211; time
taken out of real time: most cruises no longer have much to do with
going anywhere in particular. Each activity becomes a uniform,
monotonic pursuit, unrelated to others, a single thread, attracting
measurement rather than appreciation, not part of a web.</p>

<p>A common companion of personal detachment, or loneliness, is
gregariousness &#8211; being amongst, but not with, others, relating to
an outside agent in common, not to each other. It is encouraged by,
and sustains, the gigantism of modern urban facilities &#8211; enormous
astrodomes and arenas, huge rallies organized for pop concerts or
politics or sport. Often it is only when these gigantic facilities
break down that social intercourse takes place. Gregariousness
substitutes a spurious identity &#8211; nation, class, occupation, belief
&#8211; for personal identity. For too many people &#8216;I am I&#8217; is
replaced by &#8216;I am as you wish me to be&#8217;.</p>

<p>The impairment of spontaneous, unforced relatedness has not gone
without response. Large hotel chains have automated check-in kiosks
and room service in order to eliminate contacts between guests and
staff. Banks are beginning to charge account holders for
communicating with a human being rather than an automated telephone
system or an ATM. A Japanese theatrical agency runs a stable of
amateur actors who play the parts of friends, colleagues, bosses,
university professors and teachers &#8211; even siblings and parents &#8211;
at weddings: fake colleagues with no speeches to give other than
deflecting inquisitive questions begin at around 30,000 yen (&#163;190)
plus travel expenses. &#8216;Old friends of the family&#8217;, who might have
to propose toasts or deliver long, sentimental reminiscences, might
cost ten or twenty times more. In China, &#8216;apology companies&#8217; are
sprouting in the spaces emerging between the ever-present
bureaucratic cells. Charities and voluntary organizations everywhere
attach themselves to the lonely and frightened with help-lines
(&#8216;Contemplating suicide? Contact the Samaritans &#8211; 1-800&nbsp;784&nbsp;2433
&#8211; or a local crisis centre&#8217;), soup kitchens, Christmas treats and
so on. The clergy trundle through hospitals which also deploy their
own social workers. Mandatory altruism in the form of community
service is proposed for high schools in Texas as a condition of
graduation. The Japanese Ministry of Labour publishes advice on how
to avoid becoming lonely.</p>

<p>The most extreme form of dissociation is estrangement from self,
or self-alienation. People who suffer from it experience themselves
as they experience things, with the senses, but without a sense of
self. They do not feel they are the subject of their experiences,
their thoughts, their feelings, their decisions, their judgments,
their actions. They do not feel they are the centre of their world,
creators of their own acts. They do not have a sense of wholeness and
proven agency that is their own, not others&#8217;. They are as out of
touch with themselves as they are with others. Alienation at work is
a core element of this inside-out experience. As mechanical power
took over from human power and standardized machine production
replaced craft production the deep-seated need to see oneself and
one&#8217;s abilities reflected in the things one produced was
progressively denied, and with it the affirmation of identity. One
became an anonymous part of an external production system, a
disposable, interchangeable, appendage.</p>

<p>Alienation is not a natural condition. At the extreme, it is
pathological, denying the social nature of the human species and its
cultural development, threatening the very existence of those
affected. It is at least suggestive, not only of changes in
perception and fashion amongst psychotherapists, but of the
underlying change in the predicament of their clients, that the
dominant patterns of psychopathology changed markedly over the last
century, from hysteria, phobias and fixations, to &#8216;ego loss&#8217; &#8211;
a sense of emptiness, flatness, futility, lack of purpose or loss of
self-esteem, a pathological disorientation in which people do not
know what to think of, or where they stand on, issues of cardinal
importance to them. Its signs are all around. There is the enforced
isolation, the institutionalized suspicion &#8211; living constantly with
Big Brother, or rather a lot of little brothers chattering and
exchanging information over computer networks, professionally
suspicious of you and, by their very presence, stirring up your
doubts about others. Public streets and private malls, stores and
halls, churches and parks are open to the unblinking eyes of their TV
cameras. Many campuses have police officers on patrol three shifts a
day, seven days a week. They are beaded with intensified lighting and
strewn with emergency telephones that can call up a policeman within
ninety seconds. Every large commercial building has its security
guards and checks; many have entry passes. Nothing is considered
safe, and no one does not have the finger pointing at him or her.
Avoid contact; avoid being listed; dig a moat around yourself.</p>

<p>But can you? On a typical day, you might be tracked to work by an
intelligent traffic system, your employer might listen, legally, to
your telephone conversations, or tap into your computer, e-mail and
voice-mail. You may be tracked by the ever-present closed circuit
camera when shopping, and have your image stored. There are peepholes
in the fitting rooms of clothes stores, and hidden microphones. The
supermarket will log information about your purchases if you belong
to its buyers&#8217; or loyalty club. Your credit card company keeps tabs
on where and what you buy, and sells the information to eager
marketers. Tollfree numbers identify a caller&#8217;s number even if it
is unlisted, and may sell it on. Should you change your job, your new
employer may legally obtain your medical history from your insurance
company, and your credit history from a credit bureau, ask you to
submit to a drug test, a lie-detector test, or a personality test,
ask you to disclose the prescription drugs you take and whether you
have smoked in the preceding twelve months. If you&#8217;re a nanny your
new employers might track you with a concealed camera.</p>

<p>To see alienation&#8217;s private face, walk down main street anywhere
in the world. As likely as not you will encounter a run of
Walkman-wearing, eye-shaded individuals, secluded, avoiding contact
in the most crowded circumstances. Get on a commuter train, tube or
bus, to find the passengers pressed against each other, reading,
avoiding eye contact. Shuttered faces. Stop for a moment, observe
gait, posture, personal furniture: many, particularly if young,
saunter rather than walk; act cool and laid back rather than
purposefully; carry cans of coke, lager, even bottles of Evian, and
crisps (&#8216;I eat and I drink whenever I want to, wherever I want to;
it&#8217;s no business of yours&#8217;); telephoning on the trot, isolated in
crowds, and crowded in their isolation. They look defiant rather than
compliant; distant. See the clothes inspired by every style in the
world and by none at all. All of which is saying, &#8216;make of it what
you will, but don&#8217;t try to rule it. I&#8217;ll do as I please. I&#8217;m as
good as you&#8217;.</p>

<p>Dissociation goes farther than the weakening and dissolution of
social links. It colours our view of our place in nature. If we are
all there is, the final arbiters &#8211; encompassing, not coexisting
with, all reality; if we inflict such damage on the world as to make
it unpredictable; if we threaten to become the largest untamed living
beings; if we consider there to be no limits to our powers to define
and &#8216;create&#8217; nature through genetic and other engineering, and
our individual fate is only loosely connected with that nature; then
the world becomes a lonely place, a vortex of meaninglessness, a
source of anguish and of personal dislocation, in which the mind, in
weariness or leisure, recurs constantly to its obsessions.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Consequences</h4>

<p class="fst">The void in subjectivity and self, and the widening gap between
ever-more demanding standards of achievement and improving but
increasingly inadequate accomplishments, between &#8216;achievers&#8217; and
others, is teeming with illness and unhappiness. Stress is
undoubtedly more pervasive and acute for today&#8217;s Market Beings than
it was for people in precapitalist times. The kinds of stress that we
share with them &#8211; due to natural disasters, poverty, bereavement &#8211;
are much less easily dissipated through ritual, religious or other
forms of public expression, and the individual is also less protected
by community, family, kinship or neighbourhood group. In other words,
the stressful life-events might be similar &#8211; and even attenuated &#8211;
but the individual is more exposed to them.</p>

<p>A standard objective measure of stress is the presence of coronary
heart disease (CHD). A sudden heart seizure in an apparently healthy
person was first reported in the US only in the 1920s. Heart attacks
were not even mentioned in most medical textbooks until after World
War II. Now cardiovascular diseases cause 30 percent of all deaths
worldwide. Although some of the increase might reflect changes in
reporting procedures and conventions (which bias diagnosis towards a
talked-about disease), the real increase has nonetheless been
dramatic, despite new drugs, closer monitoring, and attempts at
prevention through changes in lifestyle. Accompanying the increase
has been a drop in the social level of patients.</p>

<p>Another objective indicator of stress is obesity, which is
spreading in epidemic proportions. In Britain in 1998 21 percent of
women and 17 percent of men were classed as sufficiently overweight
to seriously endanger their health &#8211; (compared with 8 percent and 6
percent respectively in 1980), and the proportion of overweight
people rose by more than one-sixth to 54 percent of men and 45
percent of women. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> In the US, more than half of adults are
overweight and over three-tenths clinically obese &#8211; only arthritis,
high blood pressure and diabetes affect more people, and only
cigarette smoking causes more deaths.</p>

<p>The most obvious and dramatic of the objective indicators of
stress are mental illness and madness. Difficult as it is to plot
their epidemiological history (for reasons of definition, diagnosis,
official policy and coverage, and for reasons to do with the late
emergence of psychiatry as a distinct profession with lobbying
power), they are attaining a progressively greater prominence: mental
disorders were not included in the World Health Organization&#8217;s
<strong>International Classification of Disease</strong> until its 6th
Revision in 1948, when they accounted for 10 pages out of 187 (5
percent). The 7th Revision (1957) also had 10 pages devoted to mental
disorders (slightly less as a share of the total); the 8th (1967) had
14 pages (3 percent), the 9th (1977) 38 pages (7.4 percent) and the
10th (1992) 76 pages (6.2 percent). By then, the WHO thought it
necessary to publish a separate 362-page volume on <strong>Mental and
Behavioral Disorders</strong>, one third as long as the main book. The WHO
predicts that clinical depression will be the leading cause of
disability and the second leading contributor to the global burden of
disease, accounting for 15 percent of the total, by 2020. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> And
British insurers have announced that stress, anxiety and depression
have overtaken back problems as the main causes of long-term
absenteeism from work.</p>

<p>Beyond mental illness lies madness &#8211; a profound, prolonged
inability (including refusal) to know and deal in a rational and
autonomous way with oneself and one&#8217;s social and physical
environment. It is unreason, disorder, a condition which the ruling
culture of the time finds difficult, for whatever reason, to engage
with positively. Modern market society is particularly conducive to
madness, or so it seems. In its first phase a large population of
misfits found themselves hauled into the Gulag-cum-madhouse of the
time. One-tenth of all arrests made in Paris from the mid-seventeenth
century to the end of the eighteenth concerned &#8216;the insane&#8217;. As
time progressed, those who could not, or would not, adapt to the new
system and its work ethic were separated out semi-permanently so that
they became, by the nineteenth century, a confined population.
Madness became distilled, concentrated, not part of everyday life. It
was segregated physically behind bars, morally and emotionally beyond
the realm of meaning and control, a demon to be avoided except as an
object of fascinated horror.</p>

<p>In time the frontier of madness drew back, but never again to its
pre-market society lines, most dramatically from the middle of the
last century. Until then the number of involuntary inmates in mental
hospitals in the US rose steadily from 183 per hundred thousand
population in 1904 to peak at 409 in 1945, putting severe strains on
medical budgets. The trend changed direction in the second half of
the century when funding was centralized and psychotropic drugs,
primarily chlorpromazine (Thorozine), that tamed the recipients (or
made them tractable), became available. Far cheaper than bricks and
mortar, and cheaper to administer, they paved the way for a
privatization and individualization of control. Numbers in
institutions fell steeply &#8211; to 380 per hundred thousand in 1956 and
194 in 1970. All but the criminally insane were let loose into &#8216;the
community&#8217; &#8211; an effective de-institutionalization rate of 91.3
percent from 1955 to 1994. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> In England and Wales, prescriptions of
anti-depressants rose from 27 per thousand men patients in 1994 to
33.3 in 1996 (19.2 to 71.3 for women patients).</p>

<p>Madness is defined with ever-greater fastidiousness: there is
mental retardation (physiological impairment); personality disorders
(the disposition to behave in abnormal ways present continuously from
early adult life); mental disorders (abnormalities of behaviour with
a recognizable onset); adjustment disorders (in response to
stressful, changed circumstances); and &#8216;other&#8217; disorders
(significantly, abnormalities of sexual preference, drug dependence).
The perimeters of madness are under constant review and adjustment,
fought over with bitterness and tenacity &#8211; it was only after a
postal ballot held in 1975 that homosexuality was removed from the
American Psychiatric Association&#8217;s list of mental illnesses.</p>
<p>At the same time madness is becoming more ambiguous. A realm of
<em>conditional sanity</em> is opening up, pacified by the
psychotropic bombs that subdue, cow and curtail. There are two issues
here. One is of definition: whether to consider the neurotic and,
especially, the chemically-constrained, mad or sane. In terms of the
culture&#8217;s ability to make them function in some sort of concert
with the majority, they are sane, if only conditionally. In this
sense, psychotropic drugs are a shining example of modern medical
culture, enabling people with a culturally-defined deficit to live
and function adequately without becoming ill. They also illustrate
the supreme vulnerability of a society where normalcy is dependent on
the existence of an intricate logistical system to supply and
administer the means of maintaining it to a large, and growing,
clientele scattered amongst the general, not quite so mad, population.</p>

<p>The other issue is of scope: in the heartlands of the modern world
the number of the potentially-mad, as defined by the culture, is
growing, but being held down. In the world at large, it is exploding:
mental disorders accounted for 10 percent of the world&#8217;s disease
burden in 1999 (as measured by years of healthy life lost), and are
expected by the World Health Organization to account for 15 percent
by 2020. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> In rich countries the cost per unit of madness, the cost
of &#8216;treatment&#8217; or prevention or control per &#8216;mental patient&#8217;,
has come down. But world spending on madness, the madness market as
it were, has not dipped at all.</p>

<p>Monitoring is sketchy. The social infrastructure is poor. The
distinctions between personal and institutional intractability, and
between political and subcultural, intractability, are blurred. When,
on 14 February 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini, then spiritual leader of
Iran, issued a <em>fatwa</em> calling on all Muslims to kill Salman
Rushdie and his publishers for <strong>The Satanic Verses</strong>, who was
criminally insane? Iran&#8217;s ruling circles <em>knew</em> it was
Rushdie. Many others thought differently ...</p>

<p>Another view of stress is subjective: people who feel their
ability to cope with normal life sufficiently impaired for them to
disrupt its daily routine. They include those who seek medical advice
and consume medication, a larger number who believe themselves to be
ill without having recourse to a physician. The number of times
people sought professional care for illness more than doubled in the
USA last century, from an average of under once a year in the 1920s
to more than twice a year in the late 1980s. In Britain the number of
consultations with a National Health Service general practitioner
rose by half between 1975 and 1996, from 196 million to 294 million.
<a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> Even more significant is the growing recourse to complementary
and alternative medicine (CAM), which is more purely voluntary since
it is not tied to the requirements of employers, insurance companies,
state agencies, police authorities and so on. In 1997 42.1 percent of
Americans resorted to CAM, compared with 33.8 percent in 1990 (an
increase of a quarter in just seven years). <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Beyond the host of people who seek help publicly and formally
there are those, almost certainly greater in number, who do so hidden
from view, as part of their normal round, and the even larger number
who cope under strain. The ultimate effect of strain is, of course,
death. And nowhere is <em>karoshi</em> (death as a result of overwork)
more closely monitored than in Japan where, on some lawyers&#8217;
estimates, it claims between 10,000 and 30,000 victims a year. In
Russia a sharp rise in the number of deaths following the collapse of
the Soviet regime is attributed not, as might be expected, to simple
poverty or the increasingly parlous state of the post-Soviet health
service, but to a &#8216;psycho-social crisis&#8217; due to greatly rising
insecurity. Life expectancy for men at birth was 15 years <em>less</em>
in 1995 than in 1983, before the transition, as 20&#8211;65-year-olds
succumbed to a complex cocktail of homicide, suicide, accidents,
falls, burns, drownings and other symptoms of psychological stress
and alcoholic bingeing. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p>There is a huge and growing market for psychotherapy, ranging from
psychoanalysis (an intricate, demanding craft), to its simplified,
routinized, modular, gadget-ridden but more-easily-marketed
derivations &#8211; an industry dedicated to reassembling or constructing
the self. A lot of it provides little more than comfort. Some of it
addresses the underlying condition, and sometimes succeeds in
self-realization or (re)assembly. The growth of psychotherapy from
the day in 1896, when Freud first hung out his shingle in Vienna, has
been remarkable, and one which shows no signs of abating. One survey
dating from 1959 listed thirty-six different kinds. Less than twenty
years later, in 1977, no fewer than 200 conceptually distinct
psychotherapies were noted. The growth in professional activity has
been far greater than the growth in the activity as such.
Psychological and emotional cures and comforting have always been
available, part of normal social intercourse. That is still the case,
within functioning families and friendship networks. But it has been
extended and partially supplanted by external, professional, marketed versions.</p>

<p>Embracing both the subjective and objective indicators of stress
are the epidemics of hysteria that sweep ever more frequently through
the market system&#8217;s heartlands &#8211; from belief in alien abduction
to satanic ritual abuse &#8211; a &#8216;cultural symptom of anxiety and
stress&#8217; in the words Elaine Showalter, the phenomenon&#8217;s theorist
and historian. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m sick and can&#8217;t work&#8217; often stands in for &#8216;I can&#8217;t
work and so I&#8217;m sick&#8217;. Absenteeism from work is a mass
phenomenon: in Western Europe alone it embraces around 14 percent
(one in seven) of the total number of people not at work for whatever
reason. In some countries declared illness accounts for astonishingly
high proportions: 60 percent of time lost in the US, 43 percent in
Belgium, 35 percent in Germany, 34 percent in Ireland and Portugal,
31 percent in Italy and Holland, 28 percent in France, 25 percent in
Canada, 20 percent in the UK and Spain. In the early nineties days
lost to sickness in Western Europe averaged 80&#8211;90 times the number
lost in labour disputes. These figures do not constitute cast-iron
evidence: different states define absenteeism and its causes
differently and different social security laws and regulations induce
different behaviour on the part of workers. The figures also do not
fully account for fake or phantom illnesses, logged in order to take
up unused entitlements to paid sick leave, to join a public rally, to
pursue romance or revenge, to care for children or others, or to slop
about and enjoy simply being. There are many, many reasons to avoid
work, even in a society that ultimately punishes non-work. On the
other hand the figures do not allow either for those who turn up to
work feeling ill, but bound by duty, fear, solidarity, circumspection
or pressing material need.</p>

<p>If early retirement is considered a form of absenteeism, as surely
it must be, when not imposed by mass firing &#8211; a meta-absenteeism if
you like &#8211; the evidence is striking. Labour-force participation of
men aged 60&#8211;64 has declined from over 80 percent in most rich
countries in 1960 to 50 percent in America and below 35 percent in
Germany, Italy and France. In Britain eight out of ten employees
retire before reaching the normal pension age as defined by their
pension-scheme rules, two-thirds before the age of sixty. By
contrast, late retirement &#8211; after normal pension age &#8211; is
negligible, even in countries with no compulsory retirement age. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p>Then there is drug taking. It combines a number of functions, some
of them mutually contradictory. On one view it is a promoter of
connectedness &#8211; a social activity, a pipe of peace, a shared joint,
which lowers barriers, removes or reduces inhibition, lubricates a
common experience. On another view it is precisely the opposite &#8211;
an escape from connectedness, a substitute for sociability, a
&#8216;solitary vice&#8217;, an avoidance of taking responsibility for one&#8217;s
own life. On both views it relieves stress. Drug-taking of all sorts
is rising. Of course drugs do not enter mouths or veins unassisted.
They are pushed in many ways &#8211; through advertising (legal drugs)
and through personal inducement and example (illegals). There are
large numbers of people with a stake in extending the market for each
and every one. But that goes for all of them. The important point is
that the drugs most indicative of social detachment &#8211; which,
incidentally, are the most restricted in the marketing methods
available to them &#8211; are the ones that are spreading fastest.</p>

<p>The supreme subjective indicator of stress is suicide. It lies at
one extreme of a range of actions that start with unconscious
self-harming behaviour like incautious cutting of vegetables,
jay-walking or swimming out of depth, and progress through &#8216;indirect
self-poisoning&#8217; through over-eating or wrong-eating to deliberate
self-harm such as impulsive overdosing without the preparation (of
dosage, secrecy) that would ensure &#8216;success&#8217;, to, finally, the
successful denouement. It is mostly committed by men, sometimes
suffering from a psychiatric disorder, often under great strain from
incompatible roles or duties or expectations. Not all suicides are a
cry of despair or for help &#8211; they can be a response to unbearable
physical pain, a fulfilment of a sense of public duty, a quest for
martyrdom, or whatever. Significantly, urban suicide is higher in
areas with relatively high boarding-house populations, immigrants and
divorcees, and in the spring and early summer, when more people are
flaunting their attractions and thereby underlining the suicide&#8217;s isolation.</p>

<p>It is not easy to gauge the prevalence of <em>real</em> suicide &#8211;
that is, &#8216;completed&#8217;, successful suicide. It is usually planned
carefully, with precautions taken against discovery, and often
camouflaged so that the death appears to be accidental (traffic
accidents, falls, drownings). Recording is haphazard; coroners&#8217;
courts in England and their equivalents elsewhere operate under
different regimes of stringency for evidence; doctors and officials
often connive with families to shift the cause of death to morally
safer (and insurance-covered) ground. Changes in reporting practice
compound the difficulties. In many countries the true figure, as
attested by psychiatrists is way above the official figure. Suspect
as the figures are, the number of recorded suicides is rising
steadily, increasing by 122 percent between the early-to-mid 1950s
and the mid-to-late 1990s in the twenty-nine countries, comprising a
seventh of the world&#8217;s population, for which comparisons could be
made. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p>Confused, with a damaged sense of self and ragged connectedness
with others, it is not surprising that Market Being is ill,
uncertain, stressed, inadequate and in need of comfort. At any one
time a quarter of the world&#8217;s population exhibit signs of physical
morbidity and mental distress. And the proportion is growing.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Costs</h4>

<p class="fst">Although not all of it can be attributed directly to market
society, the coincidence of its spread and deepening, and the
increasing prevalence of illness and distress, is remarkable.
Recorded spending on health care is on the up-and-up: from an
(unweighted) average 3.8 percent of GDP in 1960 to 8.5 percent for
the same eighteen rich countries in 1998; and from 115 international
(PPP) dollars a head to 1,974 dollars in the same years. It rose from
5.1 to 13.6 percent of GDP in the US, from 3.0 to 7.6 in Japan, 6.3
(1970) to 10.6 in Germany, 4.2 to 9.6 in France, 3.6 to 8.4 in Italy,
and 3.9 to 6.7 in the UK. Spending per head rose eighty-seven times
in Spain in the same years, seventy times in Japan, fifty-three times
in Norway, thirty-six times in Italy, thirty-one times in
Switzerland, twenty-nine times in the US and France, and twenty times
in Britain.</p>

<p>Saturation medication is becoming general: more than half of all
adults and nearly one-third of children in Britain take some form of
medication every day. In Britain and the US there are as many renewal
prescriptions for psychotropic drugs as there are inhabitants. In
England the number of medical prescriptions rose from 6.7 per head in
1982 to 9.7 in 1995.</p>

<p>Yet people are not noticeably healthier. In the mid-1970s, the
life expectancy of a person over 60 in France was just two years
higher than in 1900. For men it remained constant. While life
expectancy in the US and Britain has been rising, the proportion of
healthy people (alive and not diseased or disabled) has declined &#8211;
from 81.8 percent to 79.2 percent for men in the US between 1970 and
1980 (from 81 percent to 77.8 percent for women); and from 83.1 to
81.8 percent for men, 81.1 to 79.2 percent for women, 1976 to 1985,
in the UK.</p>

<p>In France the mortality rate for fifteen-to-twenty-year-olds is
rising at 2 percent per year. In all rich countries, for men aged
forty to fifty it rose from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. For
British workers over fifty it is higher than during the 1930s. In
some countries (and not only the &#8216;usual suspects&#8217; of the former
Soviet Union and AIDS-afflicted sub-Saharan Africa) life expectancy
at birth has stopped increasing or even entered a decline.</p>

<p>There are several ways to understand the apparent diminishing
returns to medical intervention which these statistics suggest. One
is that the underlying morbidity of the population is rising faster
than medicalization in all its forms (drugs, treatment,
hospitalization), because of a deterioration in social circumstances
or a decline in human quality, or both. It might be difficult for
readers in rich countries to grasp the fact that most people are
getting poorer as their environment deteriorates. Since the agents of
health and disease are largely social (between 80 and 90 percent of
the differences in life expectancy across the world can be explained
by the presence of clean drinking water and of literacy), it is
understandable that health suffers. In addition, countless studies
show that city life is debilitating psychologically, and that
migration contributes greatly to psychopathology.</p>

<p>A deterioration also seems to be occurring in the human stock.
Modern genetics has highlighted the ubiquity of inborn disease. In
Britain about one child in thirty is born with a genetic defect of
some kind. Over a third of registered blind people are blind for
genetic reasons and more than a half of all cases of severe mental
handicap have an inherited cause. If diseases that have an inherited
component, such as cancer or heart disease, are included, two thirds
of the population will suffer from, and possibly die of, a genetic
disease. Advances in medical and public health techniques have
permitted debilitating mutations to accumulate through the
generations, without being cleansed by natural selection through
death in infancy and childhood.</p>

<p>Another way of interpreting the apparent diminishing returns to
medical intervention, particularly in the rich countries, is to say
that the refinement of medical treatment &#8211; its fragmentation into
ever-narrower specialisms, its reductionism, its resistance to
participation by the patient, the support it lends to the loss of
self and to medical dependency &#8211; has made it less effective in
securing well-being. And it is a fact that a fifth of the patients in
a typical research hospital in the US acquire a doctor-induced
illness in the course of their treatment. But at a certain point
these distinctions divert attention from a more fundamental and
obvious truth: it is in the nature of market society to blight a
large proportion of its people with <em>mens insana in corpore insano</em>.</p>
