<h1>Class &#8220;Democracy&#8221; in Kenya</h1>

<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Review</strong>, <a href="../../../../../history/etol/newspape/soc-rev-srg/index.html#sr54_04" target="new">Vol.&nbsp;3 No.&nbsp;8</a>, April 1954, pp.&nbsp;4&#8211;5.<br />

<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">Five and a half million Africans were &#8220;awarded&#8221; one Minister,
in Lyttelton&#8217;s new Council of Ministers in Kenya. Thirty thousand
Europeans got nine. Africans outnumber Europeans 183 to 1. African
Ministers are outnumbered 9 to 1. To mix up matters even more, the
Indian element has been isolated from both sides, with two Ministers
to represent their 200,000 population.</p>

<p>And what Ministers! Anything of any importance &#8211; the portfolios
for Police, Defence and economic affairs, such as the agriculture
that supports this huge African majority &#8211; anything that counts, in
fact, is securely anchored to the British Administration &#8211; those
&#8220;Official Members&#8221; of the Council who never have to face an
election, but walk straight in from their executive posts to their
newly-created legislative ones. While the African Minister has the
enormous responsibility of the Portfolio of Communal Development,
whatever that may mean.</p>

<p>Together with these &#8220;liberal&#8221; reforms, Lyttelton proposed a
&#8220;War Council&#8221; to cope directly with the &#8220;present emergency.&#8221;
Five and a half million Africans form the emergency, but not one is
represented on the &#8220;War Council.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of all this, Lyttelton is afraid he has overstepped the
mark. After all he may have been too democratic. The reaction may be
greater than he could foresee. &#8220;If you give a finger he may want
the whole hand.&#8221; So Lyttelton has already prepared an emergency exit:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If ... the Secretary of State is satisfied that the
constitutional arrangements set out above have become unworkable,
either before the next election, or as a result of it, the position
will revert to what it was before the emergency and Her Majesty&#8217;s
Government would be free to take such action as they think fit.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">No wonder the Africans refuse to co-operate.</p>

<p>And this shameful state of affairs has raised not a murmur out of
the Labour Party leadership. Strictly no comment. So interested has
this Labour Party leadership become in the intricacies of the
capitalist investment schemes in Africa and the</p>

<p>technique of production, that when it comes to the most elementary
demand for Democracy, they stare blankly and sometimes manage a
&#8220;They&#8217;re not ready yet.&#8221; Nor were we a century ago, when we
British workers fought for our first basic democracies and gained them.</p>

<p>Only by uniting with the forces fighting for Democracy against
British Capitalism in Kenya and elsewhere can we win Socialism in the
teeth of British Capitalism in Britain.</p>

<p>The British Labour Movement must fight for a withdrawal of British
troops from Kenya and for the full Democratic rights of the people of
Kenya without distinction of race.</p>
