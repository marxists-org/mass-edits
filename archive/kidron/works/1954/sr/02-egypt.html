<p class="fst">Egypt has hit the headlines again but this time not because of
anything that happened in Egypt itself but because of its effect on
British home politics. First there was the Tory &#8220;revolt&#8221; which
Churchill himself had to placate, then, on the other side, Bevan&#8217;s
trip to Egypt.</p>

<p>Egypt is one of the trump cards of British capitalism. British
capital to the extent of some &#163;200,000,000 is invested in the
country, mainly in branches of the economy that do not compete with
the British export trade, viz., transport mortgage companies, land
holding companies banking and so on. The British textile industry
exists in the face of Japanese, Indian and other competition solely
because it monopolizes the market for high-grade expensive cotton
fabric which can be made only from long-stapled Egyptian cotton.
British exports can find a market in Asia because the Suez canal cuts
transport costs by one half on an average: from the Persian Gulf, by
80 per cent; from the West coast of India, by 77 per cent; from the
east coast, by 51 per cent. British air and shipping companies need
the services of Egyptian installations. The British army has one of
the best equipped bases in the world in the Suez Canal Zone in which
&#163;500 million is reputed to be invested. The considerable British
investments in the other countries of the Middle East &#8211; investments
in oil, railways and harbour facilities in Iraq, investments in oil
in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, investments in railways and cotton
plantations in the Sudan besides many small investments dotted about
the Arab East, all depend directly on what happens to British
investments in Egypt as Egypt generally leads the Arab world.</p>

<p>Until recently British capitalism defended its interests in Egypt
both directly through the army and the British controlled police
force and indirectly by shoring up the semi-feudal, landowning class
and by preventing the development of a home industry in Egypt which
would have served as a solid foundation for a national movement led
by the Egyptian bourgeoisie. But, although British imperialism
succeeded to a large extent in arresting the growth of a native
capitalist class powerful enough to gain economic independence
through its own struggle, it could not prevent the development of a
militant working class, which, together with an increasingly
discontented and radical peasantry, constitutes a threat to the
capitalist relations of production as such, be they foreign &#8211; or
locally-owned. It is this class conflict which now brooding
menacingly behind the scenes, now crashing out into open struggle as
during the strike wave of 1946, that determines the course of events
in Egypt and, strange as it may sound, in Britain itself. This is
what can make a Tory speak up.</p>

<p>On January 26th, 1952, Neguib took power. It was not a very
difficult thing to do as the state machine was crumbling anyway. In
February 1950, less than two years previously, workers&#8217; pressure
had forced the government to decree a fifty per cent, increase in the
cost-of-living allowance. The promise was not honoured by the bosses,
foreign and local alike The workers came out onto the streets only to
be met by the police who were thus prevented from arresting the
bosses or not obeying the law! Street fighting broke out in many
places, the severest fighting taking place it the &#8220;Sugar Company&#8221;
in Upper Egypt and at the 10,000 hand Muharram Bey textile plant near
Alexandria.</p>

<p>By itself, the Egyptian working class would not have been able to
undermine the class structure and neutralize the state machine as
they did during 1951. This time it had a revolutionary peasantry
behind it for, the Korean war had led to tremendous stock piling all
over the world, which, when it ceased, led, by 1951, to a huge slump
in cotton prices and so in the Egyptian peasant&#8217;s cash income.
Egypt&#8217;s cotton acreage was cut by 40 per cent, the rest could not
be sold because of the world textile recession. Without the cash
income from cotton, the Egyptian peasant could neither pay his rent
nor his taxes. Inexorably, the tax and rent-collectors drove the
peasant to the the wall: he must have income, he must have land! One
and three-quarter million landless peasants, 1&#190; million peasants
with less than half an acre of land together with a further 2 million
holding less than 1&#188; acres &#8211; altogether 90% of the agricultural
population &#8211; found themselves face to face with the 1&#189; per cent,
of landowners who own more than half the land of Egypt. The fabric of
Egypt began to tear. The peasants stopped paying rent, landowners&#8217;
farms went up in smoke, at Sirw in the North East Delta the peasants
divided some big estates amongst themselves &#8211; if the peasant
movement were allowed to revitalize the Egyptian proletariat which
was then on the retreat, it would have meant the beginning of the end
of Capitalism in Egypt.</p>

<p>This is where Neguib stepped in. He promised agrarian reform to
the peasants following it up a few days later with the severe warning
that refusals to pay rents and other such &#8220;unlawful acts&#8221; would
be met by strong police and military action (September, 1952). The
peasantry was temporarily isolated from the working class. As for the
latter, it was to learn immediately that Neguib&#8217;s coup did not mean
that their conditions would be improved in any way. When Farouk was
deposed and the head of his cabinet Hafez &#8217;Afifi with him, the
workers at &#8217;Afifi&#8217;s plant in Kafr ed-Dawwar struck in sympathy
and to underline the fact that their demands had not been satisfied
(August, 1952). Workers in Alexandria came out in support of the
strikers. For Neguib this was an admirable opportunity to show whose
man he was. The strike at Kafr ed-Dawwar was smashed by the police,
and many strikers killed, while one of its leaders, Khamsi, was
hanged as an example. The workers of Alexandria were treated to an
army parade.</p>

<p>At first Neguib tried to play ball with imperialism. But internal
unrest soon drove him to find an external scapegoat, viz., Britain
and the British occupation of the Canal Zone. By their continuous
anti-British agitation Neguib and his Junta thought they could
confine the deep anti-imperialist sentiment of the Egyptian masses to
an illusory nationalism which would indeed serve to camouflage the
class nature of that sentiment. But once embarked, there was no
turning back. Neguib must go on and turn the British out of the Canal
Zone, or go down in the revolutionary struggle of Egyptian workers
and peasants. He has no choice. The Egyptian workers and peasants are
by nature anti-imperialists.</p>

<p>The British Tory government can see the dilemma and the
inevitability of its evacuation, but true to its nature, is trying to
stall and hesitate, manoeuvre and hedge as much as possible, while at
the same time taking the rod to the &#8220;rebels,&#8221; those die-hard
sabre-rattlers who would so render Neguib&#8217;s position untenable that
he would either be forced towards anti-imperialist action of another
calibre e.g., economic expropriation of the Persian model or be
replaced by a more uncompromising social force. The Labour leadership
would have behaved similarly, or perhaps would have made political
concessions with greater alacrity; after all Labour does pull out
when faced with a &#8220;respectable &#8221; national movement like the
Indian one which would never dream of interfering with the operations
of British capitalism in India.</p>

<p>But what about the so called Left? Hasn&#8217;t Bevan anything to say
to the Egyptian workers and peasants? Nay Bevan remains silent; he
too seems solicitous for the interests of British Capital in Egypt.
After all, as Jennie Lee, his wife, writes in <strong>Tribune</strong>
(8/1/54): in Egypt &#8220;Property relations are as yet unchanged. There
is no clear picture of how social reforms are to be financed and
carried out.&#8221; Yet, despite the fact that the structure of Egyptian
society has remained pretty much what it was before, Jennie Lee
&#8220;cannot see anything but darkness and confusion for Egypt if Neguib
should lose control of the situation.&#8221; Does Jennie Lee sound much
different to the reactionary <strong>Economist</strong> (30/9/52). &#8220;The worst
thing that could happen to Egypt is the overthrow of the new movement
(led by Neguib) by a newer movement,&#8221; or Neguib&#8217;s &#8220;behaviour in
the last few weeks, and that of Aly Maher Pasha (his first Prime
Minister) has been the only piece of cheerful news from abroad for a
long time.&#8221; (23/8/52).</p>

<p>Not even the &#8220;reputed&#8221; &#8220;left-wing&#8221; of the Labour Party
leadership has anything in mind but to cheat the Egyptian worker and
peasant of their rightful property. The sole quarrel between the Left
and Right in British foreign policy is the question of expediency: is
it better for Britain, i.e., British investments in Egypt, i.e.,
British capitalism, to try to impose its will on Egypt or is it
better, taking into account the relation of forces, to make
concessions here and there and so secure the continued exploitation
of the Egyptian industrial and agricultural worker. The Labour Party
has shown itself quite willing to use force in imposing British
imperialism on the colonies &#8211; e.g., in Kenya; quite as willing, in
fact as the Tories in British Guiana and in Buganda. Only when faced
with a mightier opposition, as in India, or, possibly, in Egypt, has
it made concessions, be it in name only</p>

<p>We, the rank and file of the Labour Party and of the trade union
movement, must expose this deceit and demand that British capitalists
withdraw their army from Egypt immediately, that British landholding
companies divide their property amongst the tillers thereof, that
British plants be made over to their workers. We must force the
antedeluvian Tory Blimps to shut up and force Bevan to speak and show
himself as just one more sham, one more, excuse for British
imperialism and the exploitation of the Egyptian workers.</p>

<p>Hands off the Egyptian workers!</p>
