<p class="fst">The fear of the Hydrogen-bomb has bred many reactions, one of the
most common and most useless of them is the attempt to prevent an
atomic war by means of piling up signatures on petitions to the
Government praying that it take measures to ban the bomb and so save
humanity from a suicidal World War III.</p>

<p>Launchers of such petitions would have us believe that a British
Government that has a vested interest in force &#8211; we have only to
remember the Rubber War in Malaya, the War for White Supremacy in
Kenya, the Sugar and Bauxite Occupation of British Guiana, the
threatened war in Uganda &#8211; will willingly disarm because it is
faced with the consequences of its use. We are supposed to believe
that the British capitalist economy which is having such difficulty
in competing in the world market is not going to be forced into the
limitless market of war when threatened with unemployment and working
class initiative in the movement towards Socialism. We are told that
the U.S. capitalists who need a war to get rid of their surpluses
while maintaining full employment and industrial &#8220;peace and the
Russian bureaucrats who need a war to complete the robbery they
started in Eastern Europe by engulfing Western Europe as well, that
these two powers who have to use everything they have including the
H-bomb to maintain the balance between them, will voluntarily disarm
and lay themselves open to a breach of the gentlemen&#8217;s agreement
between them, to a military defeat for the sucker. No, any petition
to the manufacturers of H-bombs is as effective as asking brothel
keepers to guard the virtue of the girls in their &#8220;care.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing can be gained from petitioning the British Government
about H-bombs and disarmament; their, hands must be forced. The only
guarantee of peace is the control of the atomic industry by those who
'have most to fear from that industry, by those who can have no
conceivable interest in war, the workers of Great Britain, Russia and
America. Workers&#8217; control of the atomic industry is the only
effective international control. It must start from below, in the
plants themselves.</p>

<p>The more intelligent petition-mongers have another point to make:
although they themselves are useless and have no direct effect
petitions cause People to think and, in the long run, to act. This is
quite untrue.</p>

<p>In the first place, a petition justifies its existence only in so
far as it collects as many signatures as possible; its formulation
must be, therefore, the highest common factor of generality. It never
raises new issues but puts down on paper whatever is likely to
receive general acquiescence. There is no possibility of arguing a
point, of proving an approach right because the launching of a
petition already assumes that the body of opinion which is going to
support it is already in existence.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is untrue that petitions rouse people to action. On
the contrary, they lead to quietism and a useless salving of
conscience. They are organised by a small body of people who are
active while the mass of the people play the most passive of passive
role &#8211; a person who signs has, after all, done something and may
now hibernate and take no interest in the affairs until another
petition-hawker wakes him up to put his conscience to sleep. There is
no common activity about the wording of the petition, a struggle
which can have immense educational value, as have, for example,
resolutions passed in T.U. and Labour Party branches. A signer can
either take it or leave it, there is nothing to show him all its
implications, and there is nothing he can do besides sign.</p>

<p>Petitions as a medium of mass education, as a means of rousing
mass consciousness, are worse than useless. They come to the
rank-and-filer from outside as a finished product. Nothing he can do
can change its form. The real educational medium is the resolution
passed in the trade union branch and in the local Labour Party ward,
because these resolutions are the joint product of all members and
truly reflect the mood of the meetings.</p>

<p>Resolutions in branches are part of the normal lives of the
members as is their branch, and are thus able to be linked up with
all of their other normal activities. Resolutions can thus, lead to
action &#8211; strike action as a result of some political resolution for
example &#8211; and don&#8217;t necessarily lead one to the dead end that is
inevitably the terminus of a petition.</p>

<p>The question of war or peace, war or Socialism, lies in the hands
of the working class; petitions are useless in the arsenal of the
working class; the strongest weapon in our hands is the strike,
whether for pay or politics, and our strongest educational medium &#8211;
the branch meeting and the branch resolution.</p>
