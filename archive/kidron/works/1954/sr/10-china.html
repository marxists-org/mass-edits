<p class="fst">The Tory government can think of no way out of the economic
difficulties presented it by capitalism but war and preparation for
war. Faced with overproduction at home and unable to absorb the
surplus by raising wages for fear of competition in international
markets, unable to cut down production for fear of unemployment,
unable to invest overseas on a large scale for fear of the
anti-imperialist movement in the colonies, the Tory government sees
no way out but an ever-increasing arms budget.</p>

<p>The &#163;1,640 million a year they spend on arms is their only
insurance for the coming years. And if it is arms, there can be no
East-West trade on an appreciable scale.</p>

<p>But if the Tories cannot solve Britain&#8217;s problems of
overproduction except by war, what solutions are there? The
right-wing Labour leadership offers nothing but a rehash of the Tory
policy. Nothing to be got from there. The so-called left-wing
leadership, with the approval of the Communist Party, offers us
East-West trade, and now that the Labour Party delegation to China
has returned, the stress is laid on trade with China.</p>

<p>Is trade with China, or with the Eastern bloc as a whole, a
solution to Britain&#8217;s problem of over-production ? What are the
possibilities of such trade?</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>China cannot pay:</strong> The size of a country&#8217;s foreign trade
does not depend on the size of the country nor on the size of its
population, but on the standard of living of that population. China,
with 12 times the population of Great Britain, has a total foreign
trade (exports and imports combined) of only 13% of that of Britain
(&#163;800 million and &#163;6,031 million respectively in 1952). These
figures mean that China is terribly poor. If she is to trade with us,
what is she going to pay with?</p>

<p><em>The British Council for the Promotion of International Trade</em>,
which grew out of the Moscow Economic Conference of Businessmen held
in 1952 recently published a pamphlet (<strong>China&#8217;s Foreign Trade</strong>)
dealing with the subject. It concludes (p.&nbsp;29) that &#8220;on the
basis of her present economic programme she (China) could, within a
comparatively short space of time, begin to absorb anything from &#163;40
million to &#163;75 million worth a year of British exports.&#8221; These
exports &#8211; only 1&#189;&#8211;2&#189;% of British exports at 1952 and 1953
levels &#8211; are to be paid for by selling Britain eggs and egg powder,
vegetable oils and Tung oil, soya beans and other raw materials like
pig bristles &#8211; China&#8217;s main exports before the war.</p>

<p>For almost twenty years now these exports have been severely
curtailed if not stopped altogether and the Western capitalist has
became independent of Chinese products in the interval. One Hong Kong
businessman put the case succinctly: &#8220;the world has gone along
without China&#8217;s products for years now. Alternative sources have
been developed&#8221;. (<strong>News Chronicle</strong>, 24/8/54) If only because
of the lack of markets for China&#8217;s traditional products a jump in
her present exports to Britain of &#163;4&#189; million a year to the
proposed &#163;40&#8211;75 million seems unlikely, and without exports there
can be no payment for imports. How unlikely this is can be seen by
going into the politics of East-West trade.</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>East is East and West is West:</strong> With American capitalism
forced into the war market in order to dispose of her surplus goods
and stave off unemployment and with the Russian bureaucracy compelled
to rob the productive resources of the world in order to fulfil her
programs of industrialisation and satisfy China&#8217;s peremptory
demands for machines, with each bloc having to &#8220;defend &#8221; itself
from the other, there can be no doubt that each will tend to become,
as independent economically as possible. The American Marshall Plan,
which enforced an embargo on exports to Russia and Eastern Europe,
the later Battle Act, which extended this embargo to include China on
the one hand and <em>all</em> American satellites on the other, show
which way the wind is blowing on this side of the iron curtain. The
tendency on the other side can be seen from the fact that in 1938,
trade among Russia&#8217;s Eastern European satellites and with Russia
was only 17% of their total foreign trade while their trade with
other countries was 83%; by 1948 these percentages were 46.3 and 53.7
respectively (Y. Gluckstein, <strong>Stalin&#8217;s Satellites in Europe</strong>,
1952, p.&nbsp;63). The trend has continued so that to-day more than
half Eastern Europe&#8217;s international trade is among its own
countries and with Russia.</p>

<p>The shorter history of China&#8217;s foreign trade shows the same
pattern. Both before the Sino-Japanese war of 1937 and under Chiang&#8217;s
regime from 1945 to 1949; the Eastern bloc accounted for less than 1%
of China&#8217;s foreign trade; by 1950 the proportion rose to 26% and in
the three following years jumped to 61%, 72% and 75% respectively
(<strong>China&#8217;s Foreign Trade</strong>, p.&nbsp;12). The odds are that the
drive towards economic self-sufficiency in the Eastern Bloc will continue.</p>

<p>Some people will say that autarky, as an economic policy in the
Eastern bloc, is a result of the American-led blockade. This is true,
but only to a small extent. During the slump of the &#8220;thirties,&#8221;
when there was no question of an economic embargo and the Western
capitalists were willing to trade with the Devil himself if only he
would relieve them of their stocks, Russian imports and exports
showed a steady decline: in 1927/8 Russia imported 945.5 million
(pre-1914 gold) rubles&#8217; worth of goods, in 1932 her imports were
704.0 million (pre-1914 gold) rubles and by 1937 they had slumped to
294.2 million, or less than &#188; of the 1913 figure (Y. Gluckstein, <strong>op.
cit.</strong>, p.&nbsp;62).</p>

<p>The threat of world war is the outcome of competition between the
two autarkic economies; the existence of the threat drives them ever
more insistently towards autarky. The American ruling class, already
poised for war but waiting for some indication of popular support,
makes no bones about it and brandishes the Battle Act. The Russian
ruling class, preparing for war but fighting for time to strengthen
their weaker economy, are not so clear about self-sufficiency. On the
one hand, they would like to buy machines from the West if the West
would sell them and if the Russians could pay; on the other hand,
East-West trade is a useful propaganda weapon in an attempt to foster
squabbles between the American capitalists and their weaker European
allies who are competing with them for markets. That the importance
of East-West trade as a slogan is greater than its intrinsic
importance for the Russian economy can be seen from the economic
blockade imposed by the Eastern bloc on Yugoslavia after her
defection.</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>Trade &#8211; A Political Weapon:</strong> In 1947 Russia and the
&#8220;People&#8217;s Democracies&#8221; supplied 51.8% of Yugoslavia&#8217;s imports
and took 49.1% of her exports. On June 28th, 1948, the Cominform
opened up its campaign against the rebellious Satellite. Trade
started declining in 1948 and by 1949 it had almost ceased
altogether: in the first quarter of 1949, the Russian bloc accounted
for 26.1% of Yugoslavia&#8217;s imports and 23.8% of her exports, in the
second and third quarters these figures dropped to 14.8 and 22.2% and
3.2 and 7.7% respectively.</p>

<p>Since then trade has been negligible (Gluckstein, p.&nbsp;238). By
flourishing the big economic stick over her rebellious satellite,
Russia successfully ensconced her in the American camp, and showed at
the same time that in the sweet and sour of Russia&#8217;s international
relations, the prosecution of &#8220;peaceful&#8221; trade or the witholding
of trade is a main ingredient.</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>Britain and China:</strong> Assuming optimum conditions &#8211; that
Britain leaves the trade channels she has used for the last twenty
years and reverts to the Chinese supplier, that China&#8217;s economic
integration with the Eastern bloc progresses no further and that
Britain&#8217;s strong export markets for the goods that China will be
willing to buy wither away &#8211; British trade with China cannot be
more than 1&#189;&#8211;2&#189;% of Britain&#8217;s total foreign trade.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even this drop in the ocean (if it ever
materialises) could be a very dangerous medicine for the industries
that will benefit, as the Yugoslav ruling class can tell their
new-found British friends.</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>Capitalist Trade and Socialist Trade:</strong> As long as the world
is divided into two competing centres of capital, two separate
markets, two rival ruling classes, and as long as the two ruling
classes can resolve their difficulties only by resorting to barbaric
wars, trade between them will always serve the interests of war
between them; mutual economic support will always give pride of place
to mutual destruction.</p>

<p>East-West trade, by itself a negation of war, is being raped and
used as a slogan in the &#8220;cold&#8221; fight between the power blocs.</p>

<p>Of course, we must support East-West trade. But let us not bluff
ourselves. As long as East-West trade is the business of the ruling
classes of East and West the workers in both camps will gain nothing.</p>
