<p class="fst">Lieutenant-Colonel Hussein Shafei, one of the twelve-man Junta
that rules Egypt, wrote of British &#8220;socialists&#8221; and Tories in
power: they always work &#8220;like a united football team, with the same
gaol. If the right wing is pressed it passes the ball to the left
wing in order to manoeuvre for a goal.&#8221; (<strong>News Chronicle,</strong>
16-12-53). Shafei was interested primarily in British foreign policy,
which, Labour come, Labour go, shows such a monotonous regularity
that once seen, it never need be looked at again. But this Changing
Guard at Buckingham Palace is not only a tourist attraction inviting
comment from those affected by British foreign policy; anybody who
cares to look at the figures can see that the Labour Government &#8211;
reputed to have created a &#8220;revolution&#8221; in the lives of the
working people &#8211; did nothing, simply nothing, to change the setup
of British capitalist society. What it did do &#8211; for which the
Tories are truly grateful &#8211; was to make the Capitalist machine run
a little more smoothly: debits (losing concerns) were nationalised
and made the responsibility of the people, credits (the profit-making
concerns) were no concern of theirs.</p>

<p>When attacked on their foreign policy, their nationalisation
policy, and so on, the Labour Party leaders always counter with the
argument that the Labour Government changed Britain from a capitalist
country into a Welfare State, i.e., into a state which has as its
object &#8220;the enhancement of the personal welfare of the individual
citizen.&#8221; Did it? Has the personal welfare of the individual
citizen been enhanced during Labour&#8217;s term of office? On the whole,
no. The proportion of the national income spent on social services at
the end of the Labour Government&#8217;s term was the same as that spent
in the last year of the pre-war Tory Government. Besides, the
present-day Tory Government has left the Welfare structure intact
although it has cut into it to some extent. The ball was successfully
passed from right to left, and from left back to right in a well-
co-ordinated move. Same ball, same team.</p>

<p>The Labour Party leaders always point proudly to their record in
office. Look, they say, the Tories spent only 2 per cent of the
national income on education in 1938&#8211;39, while Labour raised it by 10
per cent to 2.2 per cent of the national income by 1950&#8211;1951. Very
true, BUT, in the same period the number of children between the ages
of five and fourteen attending state-aided schools increased by
exactly 10 per cent, so that the increase in total expenditure was
neutralised, and the individual school child was no better provided
for than before. Besides, the Tory Government that replaced Labour
kept to the self-same figure &#8211; 2.2 per cent of the national income
was spent by the Tories for the same purpose in 1951&#8211;52. It seems
that the Tories are quite satisfied with Labour&#8217;s education policy.</p>

<p>The case of education illustrates a much wider issue &#8211; a big
proportion of the rise in social service expenditure was a result not
of a change in policy or in social service law but of a change in the
numbers of people to whom the law applies. For example, between 1938
and 1951 the population of the United Kingdom increased by 2,800,000,
of which fully 2,500,000 benefited automatically from the social
services. These, the very young and the very old, would have
benefited even under the old Tory social service regime, so that the
Tory Government of 1938 would have had to add a further &#163;50&#8211;80
million were they faced with the present size and age distribution of
the population. This alone would have pushed up the proportion of the
national income spent by the Tories on social services before the war
by something like 16 per cent.</p>

<p>The Labour leadership also likes to take credit for initiating
welfare services where they had only brought previously-existing
private benefits under state control &#8211; as if diverting a stream can
make the volume of water greater! For example, in 1938&#8211;39 some
&#163;12&#8211;15 million were paid out by Friendly Societies in sickness and
other benefits, and another &#163;10 million by employers &#8211; these sums
were not included in social service statistics, because they did not
flow through official channels. Since then these funds are
administered by the State in the National Insurance and Industrial
Injuries Schemes. The worker has gained nothing by the change,
although it looks as though he has. Same ball, same team.</p>

<p>The same applies to health services, the pride of the Welfare
State. What came out of the wage packet before the war as a private
doctor&#8217;s fee, is now deducted from earnings in the form of taxes
and paid over to the National Health Service. In both cases, the
worker paid for medical attention out of his own pocket. This does
not mean to say that medical attention has not improved on the whole
because on the one hand there has been a process of equalisation in
benefits, so that the use of the National Health Scheme depends on
need rather than income, and on the other hand the standard of living
has risen during this period, which means that in any case more money
would have gone towards medical attention than otherwise.</p>

<p>The figures can spin tales like these from here to eternity. Their
theme is that the Labour Government cut the national cake strictly
according to the pattern adopted by the Tories before and continued
by the Tories afterwards. Here and there Labour managed to add a few
crumbs which would otherwise have been left for big business, to the
workers&#8217; slice. But there was no change in principle. The Labour
Party leaders were and still are wedded to British capitalism with
its three supporting pillars: profit-making concerns must be left in
private hands, social services must be covered by taxing the working
class, and British imperialism must never die. As long as these
remain intact, the Labour leadership will put up a heroic defence for
working-class rights, huge hosts of words will storm parliament and
possibly be victorious, only to bring home triumphantly a few paltry
concessions allowed by an enfeebled capitalist class at a time when
the national cake was growing anyway. The cake increased because the
post-war world was a boom world: the wholesale destruction caused by
the war, the exclusion of Germany and Japan from competition and
other factors led to full employment not only in Labour England but
in conservative France. In England which was relatively undamaged by
the war, full employment was connected with a rising standard of
living, in badly damaged France the standard of living was prevented
from falling. But as soon as the cake stopped growing, that is, as
soon as German and Japanese exports started competing with the
British, American competition was intensified and the price of
imports rose, and, as soon as the British capitalist class regained
its strength by feeding on the bigger cake, the Labour leadership was
caught helpless. Having initiated no far reaching changes on the home
front which would have given it unqualified workers&#8217; support, it
was weakened also on the international front. The Labour leadership
then joined the arms race &#8211; in 1938&#8211;39 when the Tories were
preparing for war, social service expenditure still exceeded
expenditure on defence by &#163;10,000,00. The 1951&#8211;52 &#8220;peace&#8221;
budget, prepared by the Labour Government, provided for a defence
expenditure which was greater than the combined social services and
food subsides bills. The Tories themselves could not have done
better.</p>

<p>Same ball, same team.</p>
