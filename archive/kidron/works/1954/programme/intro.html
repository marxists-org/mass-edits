<p class="fst"><strong>Socialist Review</strong> published a 12-point programme on the back page of the newspaper on a regular basis. In 1954 a series of articles appeared, explaining the programme point by point. In practice points 1 and 2 were dealt with together in the first article, and point 7 on the NHS seems to have been so obvious no article was needed to explain it. So the series only ran to ten articles.</p>
