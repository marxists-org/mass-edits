<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">The Annual Conference of the British Labor Party was opened on
Tuesday, June 27th, at Edinburgh. Delegates from trade unions, I.L.P.
and Fabian Societies, Trades Councils and Land Labor Parties were
there assembled, representing over 4,000,000 members. Mr. J.W Jowett,
the veteran of the I.L.P., acted as president.</p>

<p>The majority of the delegates consisted of the general officials
and the petty officials of the trade unions. In addition to these
there were a number of middle-class Fabians, etc. The proportion of
workmen delegates coming direct from the workshop was necessarily
small.</p>

<p>The conference was held in the shadow of the General Parliamentary
Election, and the motives determining the conference speeches of the
Labor Party chiefs, and the setting of the agenda, were undoubtedly
those which made for &ldquo;window dressing&rdquo; for the electoral
campaign.</p>

<p>Britain is the land of smug bourgeois responsibility, and one of
the main tasks of the Parliamentary labor leaders is to convince
their petty-bourgeois supporters that their responsibility is without
reproach. A lively fear of being &ldquo;painted red&rdquo;, of being
denounced as &ldquo;Bolsheviks&rdquo;, &ldquo;wild revolutionaries&rdquo;,
and so on, at the forthcoming election was ever-present in their
minds.</p>

<p>The main issues of the Conference &ndash; questions that aroused
the greatest discussion and most animated debates &ndash; were those
issues raised by the Communists. The questions of foreign policy, of
Communist Party affiliation, of Privy Councillorships, and the
amendments of rules for the purpose of keeping Communists out of
Labor Party conferences were all matters which Communist Party
members, as members of their trade unions or local Labor Parties had
forced for discussion on the Conference. Unfortunately, the numerical
strength of the Communists at the Conference was not very large, and
this enabled the reactionaries to use their &ldquo;big guns&rdquo; to
the best advantage.</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Henderson submitted the proposal for the alteration of
the rules by the addition of the following:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Conditions of eligibility of delegates from
Constituent Bodies to either local Labor Parties or to any National
or Local Conference of the Labor Party:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li class="quote">Every person nominated to serve as delegate shall
individually accept the constitution and principles of the Labor
Party.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li class="quote">No person shall be eligible as a delegate who is a
member of any organization having for one of its objects the return
to Parliament or to any local Governing Authority of a candidate or
candidates other than such as have been endorsed by the Labor Party,
or have been approved as running in association with the Labor
Party.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">This occasioned a lengthy debate, and was ultimately carried by an
overwhelming majority. While some speakers professed that it was
aimed at capitalist-subsidized bodies masquerading as Labor
organizations, all realized that it was really proposed to exclude
the Communists.</p>

<p>The Bill before the House of Commons to prevent the trade unions
from making a levy on their members to assist the Labor Party
financially was made the occasion for a resolution by J.R. Clynes;
the Conference agreeing that everything should be done to oppose the
measure.</p>

<p>Typical Labor Party resolutions were carried on &ldquo;universal
disarmament&rdquo; and the &ldquo;repudiation of all treaties or
understandings&rdquo; between Governments.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Moscow Social Revolutionaries</h4>

<p class="fst">C.T. Cramp, of the Railwaymens&rsquo; Union, moved a resolution on
behalf of the Executive against &ldquo;the injust treatment of the
Russian Social Revolutionary prisoners of the Government of Russia&rdquo;
regarding their &ldquo;trial as nothing short of scandalous, and is
of the opinion that the execution of any of these comrades would be
an outrage to the working class sense of justice, and a tragedy which
Socialist and Labor Parties would remember only with shame and
dishonor&rdquo;. Sidney Webb seconded this, saying that the adoption
of the resolution would have a helpful influence on the Russian
Government, which was particularly susceptible to the expression of
working class opinion in other countries&rdquo;. Harry Pollitt
opposed, alleging that the resolution was being rushed on a
conference which did not know the facts. They had no right to
interfere in Russian affairs. He was convinced that Vandervelde had
only left Russia because he had learned from documents on the spot
that the accused men were really guilty.</p>

<p>The resolution was carried.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Communist Affiliation</h4>

<p class="fst">The debate on whether the Communist Party of Great Britain should
be permitted to affiliate to the Labor Party or not arose on the
Executive report dealing with the correspondence which had taken
place on the subject between the Labor Party and the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Harry Pollitt moved that the report of the Executive on the matter
be remitted back for the consideration of the new Executive. He said
that that question had to be considered from the point of view that
the Communist Party was a party of the working class. The whole
method of approach had been to submit a series of questions to the
Communist Party, and the whole thing resembled two trade unions
haggling as to who was to get best terms out of an amalgamation. They
had to consider the question from the point of view of the situation
in which the working class movement of this country found itself at
the present time. They were grappling for a way out. He maintained it
was the business of that Conference to see that a straight question,
without any haggling or quibbling on either side, was put to the
Communist Party as to whether they would or would not accept and
abide by the constitution of the Labor Party. If they said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;
and violated that, then they would be expelled; and if they said &ldquo;No&rdquo;
then they would know where they were. He wanted to submit that the
Communist Party was an integral part of the working class movement.
It was time it had candidates in the field opposing official Labor
Party candidates, but these were questions which could he made the
subject of negotiation if the Communist Party were affiliated. The
real objection was that they were afraid that if they took the
Communist Party in, then they would lose votes at the next election.
What was the situation they were confronted with? It was that when
the Labor Party were in power they would not depend upon the Fabians
for the power which was to translate their demands into action; they
would depend upon the men in the mines and the shipyards, and that
was where the votes of the Communist Party happened to be. That
party, whether they liked it or not, must in the future make itself
felt, and that force ought to be expressed, in his opinion, inside
the Labor Conference and inside the labor movement.</p>

<p>In supporting, H. Hinshelwood said that so far as the Communists
were concerned, they were for the unification of the forces of Labor,
and would fight resolutely against anything which would tend to the
disintegration of these forces. There would be no more loyal
individual members working in the ranks of the Labor Party than those
of the Communist Party, even although the affiliation was rejected.
They were pledged morally and in every other way to do all they could
to secure victory for Labor, to stop the rot in connection with
working class organization, and to hasten the victory of the
proletariat.</p>

<p>Frank Hodges of the Miners&rsquo; Federation and Ramsay MacDonald
led the opposition. The former declared that the British Communists
were the intellectual slaves of Moscow, and that, so long as they
were bound by the Theses of the Third International, there could be
no reconciliation. The British Labor Party, as the opponent of any
government by dictatorship, must engage in propaganda against them.
&ldquo;They want to come in&rdquo;, said MacDonald, &ldquo;because
they think they can wage war against us more effectively from within
than from without. They tell us quite candidly that they want to
shake hands with us, and, at the same time, they have a dagger in the
other hand to stab us&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The card vote resulted: Against affiliation, 3,086,000; in favor
of affiliation, 261,000. In reference to this vote the number in
favor of affiliation would have been much larger had the minorities
in many of the big organizations, like the Miners&rsquo; Federation
and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, been given the right to
express themselves in the voting.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>No Political Alliances</h4>

<p class="fst">On the motion of Robert Williams a resolution was carried
affirming the decision of the Conference to refuse to permit the
Labor Party to enter into any alliances with either of the capitalist
parties.</p>

<p>The question as to whether a member of the Labor Party should be a
King&rsquo;s Privy Councillor was carried by an overwhelming majority
in the affirmative, Henderson declaring that it was a &ldquo;pure&rdquo;
honor and Thomas stating that he was going to remain a Privy
Councillor in spite of any decisions that might be made.</p>

<p>The whole tendency of the Conference was towards the Right. The
appointment of the Fabian bureaucrat, Sidney Webb, as its chairman is
indicative of this. How long this will remain so is uncertain. The
condition of the masses is growing more terrible as the days go by.
The miners are seething with discontent &ndash; a discontent which
must find expression in their organizations and sooner or later have
its effect on the Labor Party. As with the miners, so with the
engineers, the railwaymen, the printers, and so on. The Communists
will voice this discontent in the trade unions and the trade unions
will be compelled to re-shape the policy of the Labor Party.</p>

<p>Such questions as the problem of the unemployed, the condition of
the miners, and the decline in the membership of the trade unions,
received almost no attention at the Conference, and this fact
demonstrates a detachment from the masses which undoubtedly is a
great weakness of the Labor Party and is the natural outcome of the
petty-bourgeois policy of its dominating elements.</P>
