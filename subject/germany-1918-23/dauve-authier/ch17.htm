<p class="fst">Just as the Commune was the &#8220;daughter&#8221; (Engels) of the IWA, 
the German revolution was the daughter of an International Left which was never 
able to provide itself with a united organization, but whose greatest currents 
were the German Left, which in its struggle even dared to uphold the 
programmatic leadership established by the revolutionary movement itself, and 
the Italian Left which assumed the historical task of carrying on the work of 
the International Left, completing it and formulating it in its attacks on the 
victorious counterrevolution; they have bequeathed to us their theoretical 
weapons ... which will constitute the basis of the future revolutionary movement 
which finds its greatest historical example in the German Left. The revolution 
of the future will not be a mere matter of &#8220;imitation&#8221;; it will be a question of 
continuing the &#8220;thread of time&#8221; traced by the International Communist Left.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The thesis of an &#8220;infantile disorder&#8221; of the Left must be 
jettisoned. The young communist organizations, in effect, suffered from a crisis 
of &#8220;growth&#8221; between 1918 and 1921 (depending on the country in question), but 
one which was decidedly unlike that which Lenin diagnosed in his celebrated 
pamphlet. The tendency towards infantilism was a lesser threat than the 
opportunist danger. The inability to pose the real problems, to place the 
Russian experience into context by distinguishing the tasks of a communist 
revolution in the west, to make a decision regarding the political and trade 
union structures of the past, in order to demarcate one&#8217;s position from 
centrism, to have no illusions about democracy and the capitalist state, even a 
&#8220;socialist&#8221; one&#8212;this was the real disorder. Far from being the fruit of a lack 
of intellectual maturity&#8212;even though theoretical backwardness weighed heavily in 
the balance&#8212;this crisis was the reflection, among the organized minority, of the 
proletarian defeat at the very moment when the proletariat effectively 
confronted capitalist society and began to unite against the latter&#8217;s 
concentrated forces (State or para-State, such as the fascists). Lenin helped to 
solve the crisis by reinforcing the reformist elements in the young Communist 
Parties. He did not cure the disease of the revolutionary proletariat, he killed 
the patient. The crisis of growth would be resolved with the complete passage of 
the Communist Parties into the ranks of the counterrevolution.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not a choice between a majority which was evolving towards 
revolutionary positions, with the help of the Communist International, and a 
sectarian and infantile minority; nor is it an opposition between a centrist 
&#8220;unstable terrain&#8221; and a pure and unchanging communist left. One could pick and 
choose a series of <i>contradictory</i> positions (even among the best elements) 
comprising &#8220;attempts to extricate oneself from difficulties&#8221;, from which only a 
minority would emerge intact by developing what was essential&#8212;and even in these 
cases, in a contradictory manner. Instead of compiling a retrospective history 
whose point of departure is what the left had ultimately become, we shall 
situate its evolution and constitution into small groups within a broader effort 
focused on clarification and radical actions.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">The Left in Russia</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Brest-Litovsk was one of this epoch&#8217;s great revolutionary 
milestones, as well as the first great revolutionary defeat. It also marked the 
appearance of a &#8220;left&#8221; which, while opposed to Brest-Litovsk, was at least quite 
lucid in its opposition to what the movement was &#8220;historically forced to do&#8221;. In 
the face of the danger posed by the resumption of the German advance which was 
penetrating deep into Russia, Lenin&#8217;s &#8220;realism&#8221; was possibly the only solution. 
But the &#8220;left communists&#8221; of the Russian Communist Party thought it was possible 
to carry out a revolutionary war against the German Army, disintegrating and 
demoralizing it through fraternization and guerrilla attacks. It would be 
incorrect to evoke a &#8220;red patriotism&#8221; in reference to this proposal, as Bordiga 
did afterwards.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> In the spring of 1918, the left was fighting for workers 
control of industry in order to prevent what it called &#8220;State capitalism&#8221;. At 
the Bolsheviks&#8217; Sixth Party Congress, Preobrazhensky had already lamented the 
modification of the proposed resolution on &#8220;The current period and the war&#8221;: &#8220;I 
would prefer to return to the original formula which spoke explicitly of the 
establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat.&#8221; Bukharin responded: &#8220;We 
have adopted a less rigorous formula because it is absolutely impossible for us 
to claim that we have the power to fight a revolutionary war.&#8221;<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> One year 
later, at the Seventh Congress, having in the meantime become a &#8220;left 
communist&#8221;, Bukharin proclaimed the immanence of an international civil war and 
the need to prepare for it. The left&#8217;s extreme position was, perhaps, 
impractical. It was the demand of the most intransigent tendency of its time, 
obstinately determined to defend the proletariat and the revolution at every 
moment. Today it is easy to present the &#8220;evidence&#8221; supporting Lenin&#8217;s point of 
view, but he had to fight hard to convince the party&#8217;s leadership. Luxemburg 
considered the separate German-Russian peace treaty to be a catastrophe&#8212;which 
was unfortunately inevitable&#8212;whose &#8220;historical responsibility&#8221; she attributed to 
the German workers who allowed the war against the Russian revolution to 
continue. The suspension of hostilities in effect reinforced the German State 
and its militarism, obstructing the possible evolution of the German army 
towards an admittedly difficult revolutionary path. This first compromise on the 
part of the Bolsheviks encapsulates their later evolution: the defeat of the 
European proletariat compelled them to compromise, which was theorized as a 
&#8220;partial success&#8221; in the name of realism, while it strengthened capital, and the 
left rejected it without being able to propose an alternative.</p>

<p class="fst">The &#8220;left communists&#8221; went beyond Lenin in their conception of 
the content of socialism, insisting on the abolition of <i>value</i>, which was, 
however, understood in an administrative sense and not as a social process: the 
destruction of capitalism as a system was largely understood by the Russian left 
communists as the transition from anarchy to planning.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> The communist 
perspective was primarily viewed as a management technique. This current would 
later be integrated, by its own will, into the Bolshevik majority, and the 
European left would remain at the margin of the problem. The Russians had posed 
the problem of communism without having the means to realize it: the westerners, 
who were capable of realizing communism, did not reach that stage because the 
proletariat did not go on the offensive. The European left would not pose the 
problem of communism until after 1930. The left communists tried to defend a 
program which attempted to be <i>internationalist</i> (cf. Brest-Litovsk) and <i>
communist</i> (communist social transformation) at the same time. Subsequent 
left groupings would be different: the Workers Opposition and Miasnakov&#8217;s 
Workers Group represented, in the period after the civil war, in the purest and 
also the most direct way, the interests of the proletarians (cf. the preceding 
chapter). The world socialist revolution, whatever was thought and said at the 
time, was not the order of the day. From that time on, the workers <i>made their 
demands</i> within a social system which no longer depended upon them, but on a 
national and international balance of forces which the revolutionaries could not 
affect. Neither the Russian left communists nor the European communist left 
could do anything to help themselves; they could not even understand their place 
within the epoch: their lack of international links was not a result of 
organizational or theoretical flaws, but the effect of the non-existence of the 
proletariat as an effective <i>international</i> force.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">France</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In January of 1916, the French internationalists formed the 
Committee for the Resumption of International Relations, which was composed of 
two elements: socialist and syndicalist. Each underwent a split within its 
ranks. Some of the socialists (Loriot) and some of the syndicalists (Monatte) 
joined the Communist International and fought to reconquer the majority of the 
SFIO. One part of the socialists (Sigrand) and one part of the syndicalists 
(Péricat) wanted a small organization based on clear principles, which would 
break with parliamentarism and traditional politics. In the fall of 1916, they 
founded the Committee for Syndicalist Defense. Renamed the Committee for the 
Third International in May of 1919, the Committee for the Resumption of 
International Relations was asphyxiated under the mass of the SFIO centrists who 
had suddenly become &#8220;revolutionaries&#8221; after 1917, and who would later found the 
French Communist Party. There were also leftist tendencies in the Committee for 
the Third International, however: a proposed motion of the CTI, published in 
January 1921 in <i>L&#8217;Internationale Communiste</i> (No. 5), declared support for 
abstention when there is an offensive movement of the proletariat and a 
revolutionary situation, but also refused to make this position the grounds for 
a split.</p>

<p class="fst">The Committee for Syndicalist Defense, which also joined the 
Communist International in May 1919, only gave rise to small groups dominated by 
the ideological weight of revolutionary syndicalism, which were in turn divided 
between socialists and anarchists. The &#8220;Communist Party&#8221;, founded in May 1919, 
broke apart at the end of the year. It confused party and soviets, calling its 
sections &#8220;soviets&#8221;. Its optimism led J. Fabrice to write in September 1919: &#8220;The 
Communist Party has actually been founded in France. The initiative for the 
founding of the party was primarily due to the efforts of comrade R. Péricat&#8217;s 
syndicalist group. He is of the opinion that France will repeat the stages of 
the Russian revolution. The moderate socialists will take power first and we 
must prepare, starting right now, to overthrow them. Towards this end, he wants 
all revolutionary elements to unite, that is, the left socialists, the 
syndicalists and the anarchists.&#8221;<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> Some of these revolutionaries were based in 
quite localized working class sectors (the Seine road workers union, with 
Lepetit). The defeat of the strikes of 1919 condemned them, as did their own 
confusion, which led them to confuse the rejection of parliamentarism with the 
rejection of the dictatorship of the proletariat. They did, however, correctly 
criticize the CTI&#8217;s tendency to privilege work in the SFIO. Sigrand wrote in <i>
Le Communisme</i> of July 1920: &#8220;We must expect to see a new party formed at the 
next socialist congress which will do no less than call itself the &#8216;Communist 
Party&#8217; and will include the CTI.&#8221; But he would remain faithful to the Communist 
International, which he considered (as did the KAPD) to be merely ill-informed, 
until September when he would declare his opposition to the dictatorship. On 
September 26, he called for joint action with Malatesta&#8217;s group, the KAPD, the 
English Communist Party (the leftist faction: cf. below) and the IWW.</p>

<p class="fst">It was not the defeat of the revolutionary movement which caused 
the Bolshevik &#8220;model&#8221; to be &#8220;transplanted&#8221; (Kriegel) in other countries: it was 
this defeat which transformed their attempts to drive the revolutionary process 
forward into a neo-reformism which was a continuation of the old reformism. The 
formation of powerful Communist Parties did not take place strictly where the 
revolutionary movement had been most active, but where the <i>old</i> political 
and trade union structures had suffered from the most serious crises. In France, 
the SFIO and the CGT had lost prestige in the eyes of a large part of the 
workers and <i>peasants</i>, whose vote was decisive at Tours.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> There would be 
no &#8220;communist left&#8221; in France until the end of the 1920s.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">Switzerland</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The workers&#8217; low standard of living led to a strike by bank 
employees in September-October 1918.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> Militants who had previously been 
involved with the <i>Forderung</i> Group and J. Herzog founded a Communist 
Party. In November, the labor movement, led by a &#8220;committee&#8221; set up by Olten and 
Grimm (centrists), called a general strike merely for the purpose of generating 
pressure to achieve democratic reforms. The professional employees, who had 
enjoyed the workers&#8217; help in October, did not take part in the strike. The 
bourgeoisie, as elsewhere, repressed the strike and granted some concessions. In 
its Congresses of October 1918 and March 1919, the Communist Party was severely 
critical of the Socialist Party (Platten). The Communist Party participated in 
the elections of August 1919. Even so, the &#8220;Swiss ultra-leftists&#8221; were 
criticized by the Communist International in September 1919.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> The Swiss 
Socialist Party, having undergone a split, sought extra-parliamentary means of 
struggle and provided itself with a flexible organizational structure, the 
Workers Union. During general strikes in Basel and Zurich, on July 31 and August 
5, 1919, five workers were killed. The Socialist Party decided to join the 
Communist International, only to be expelled later, in December 1920, when 
confronted with the 21 Conditions. A minority within the party (8,000 militants) 
would eventually, in March 1921, join the &#8220;Old Communists&#8221; (<i>Altkommunisten</i>) 
with Herzog, &#8220;who defended left communist positions (rejection of 
parliamentarism and participation in elections, propaganda for the formation of 
soviets)&#8221;.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">According to Humbert-Droz, a French-speaking Swiss communist, 
before the Second World Congress, the German-speaking Swiss Communist Party 
&#8220;adopted, on the issues of the trade unions and parliamentarism, positions which 
were quite similar to those of the German KAP&#8221;.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> Herzog intervened at the 
Second Congress against parliamentarism. Later, he subscribed to the Theses of 
this Congress, in its essential points. In January 1921, he conceded great 
importance to the trade unions, future &#8220;directing organs of communist 
production&#8221;.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> He reproached the Russians for remaining &#8220;indifferent&#8221; in the 
face of &#8220;all the maneuvers of the center&#8221;. He accepted revolutionary 
parliamentarism, with the proviso that he could change his opinion in the event 
that it should prove to be opposed to revolutionary interests.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">Belgium</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The revolution proceeded more slowly in this country, although it 
went deeper, since the &#8220;integration&#8221; of its workers by capital was similar to 
degree attained by capital in Germany. Unlike Germany, however, where the 
party-trade union rivalry reigned, the Belgian socialist and trade union 
sections, and the cooperatives as well, all nominated delegates to the General 
Council of the Belgian Workers Party, which more effectively unified the workers 
movement than any other country&#8217;s party.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> Belgium, very industrialized, and 
very &#8220;working class&#8221;, produced a left which was quite similar to the German 
Left, and which criticized both parliamentarism and the trade unions, although 
not as clearly as the German Left.</p>

<p class="fst">No Belgian group with a national membership base joined the 
Communist International in 1919.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> In the summer of 1919, the Young Socialist 
Guards (the youth organization of the POB) published the first issue of its 
journal <i>Socialism</i> and announced its support for the Communist 
International, but did not advocate a split. In November, it refused to help the 
POB in the elections.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> In January 1920, sixty of its members, with Van 
Overstraeten, a factory worker, at their head, held a conference and founded the 
group known as the Independent Communists of Brussels. Their journal, <i>The 
Communist Worker</i>, sided with the left. It tried to avoid the council 
fetishism characteristic of the press of other workers organizations (cf. No. 7, 
June 1, 1920). They sent a delegate to the Amsterdam Conference, for which they 
provided extensive publicity. They supported the KAPD. This group remained small 
and was limited to Brussels.</p>

<p class="fst">In October 1919, groups from Ambers, Louvaine and Ghent founded a 
Flemish communist group around <i>De Internacional</i>, which never had a 
national audience. The unification of this group with the Brussels organization 
mentioned above failed because the Brussels communists demanded that certain 
Flemish members be excluded. During this period, the POB left, severely 
criticized by <i>L&#8217;Ouvrier Communiste</i>, remained in the party under the 
leadership of Jacquemotte (the future Thorez of Belgium): Humbert-Droz 
considered him to be a centrist.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> In May 1920, the ICB held a conference of 
French-speaking Belgian communists and founded the Walloon Communist Federation. 
This conference approved a set of &#8220;theses on parliamentarism&#8221; which opposed the 
councils to the State.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> Van Overstraeten attended the Second Congress of the 
Communist International. According to Rosmer,<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> he did not criticize the 
essential points of the Leninist line, but only expressed his fear that this 
line would favor opportunist tendencies. In any event, the Belgian left 
communists were more anti-parliamentary than anti-trade union, as subsequent 
articles in the Red Trade Union International&#8217;s journal, <i>La Lutte de classes</i>, 
proved. From this perspective, their position was intermediate between the 
German and the Italian Lefts.</p>

<p class="fst">In September 1921, the WCF united with the left wing of the POB, 
which had just been excluded from the party, and founded the Belgian Communist 
Party, which had few members. Van Overstraeten would be excluded in 1928 for 
&#8220;Trotskyism&#8221;. The Communist Party was the heir of the Socialist Party center.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">Finland</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Part of the Russian empire until its independence in December 
1917, Finland was wracked by civil war from January to March of 1918. The 
revolutionaries organized in the left wing of the Socialist Party, who had taken 
power in the south, were defeated by the reaction supported by Germany. The 
communist Finns working in Russia founded the Finnish Communist Party there in 
August. The following summarizes the lessons which its leader, O. Kuusinen, drew 
from the failure of the Socialist Republic of Finland, in his work <i>The 
Finnish Revolution: an Auto-critique</i>.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It was utterly typical that, during the meeting of the 
(socialist) party held in June 1917&#8212;where, by the way, we had joined the 
Zimmerwald International&#8212;not one voice was heard demanding that we separate 
ourselves from the government socialists ... the road of democracy, it then 
seemed, was open and offered vast possibilities. We expected that we could avoid 
the worst outcome by using parliamentary methods. And what has been the result 
of this historical error? Were we able to avoid an armed conflict? No! 
Parliamentary action was and can only be a danger to the working class movement. 
All that it did was to uselessly gather together all the forces which were 
necessary for the revolutionary struggle. Parliamentary activity has only served 
to deceive the masses; it was used to conceal from them the preparations of 
their enemies, the bourgeoisie, when it was the working class which should have 
been making preparations. It is now seen that the idea of the democratic state 
... was <i>historically false</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The idea of the democratic state was an attempt to fill a 
vacuum, to serve the transition from capitalism to socialism. But democracy is 
incapable of assuming the responsibility for such a mission. It has revealed its 
historical nature during the course of the revolution. Although no one had 
declared their opposition to it, it satisfied neither the bourgeoisie nor the 
workers. Its essential characteristic was, in reality, its lack of cohesion, a 
weakness which necessarily afflicts democracy throughout all of bourgeois 
society.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Social Democracy claimed it supported the revolution. Yet, 
what was its rallying cry? Power to the workers? No, its rallying cry was 
democracy, and respect for democracy. We had not understood that, when the 
revolution broke out, the workers had violently overthrown the democracy, they 
had shaken it off as if it were a nuisance.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Kuusinen showed how the socialists used the democracy to 
consolidate their power. Later, when the workers rejected the democracy, the 
bourgeoisie rejected the socialists and resorted to terror. It is not enough to 
evoke the necessity of the illegal and military struggle; it must also be 
understood how democracy is opposed to the revolution. This analysis implicitly 
criticized positions like those taken by the First Congress of the Communist 
International in regard to democracy and parliamentarism, as well as, of course, 
the later tactics of the united front and workers governments. The Communist 
International admitted that democracy was not revolutionary, but it claimed that 
one <i>could make use of it</i>. The left, on the contrary, said that in order 
to fight it one had to remain <i>outside of it</i>. At first this appeared to be 
a slight difference, but it soon highlighted the abyss which existed between the 
left and the majority. The latter thought it could take a <i>non-neutral</i> 
social reality and, with certain precautions, turn it into a useful &#8220;tool&#8221;.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Our forces must focus on abolishing the bourgeois state rather 
than setting up in its place, either before or after the revolution, a 
democracy.&#8221; This was the revolutionary position expressed at that time by the 
Finnish Communist Party, which had also expressed its reservations, at the First 
Congress of the Communist International, on the topic of the revolutionary use 
of the trade unions.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> At its founding Congress in May 1920, the party of the 
socialist left also interpreted parliamentarism as &#8220;a buttress of the bourgeois 
state&#8221;: &#8220;The bourgeois government, in order to stay in power, must avail itself 
of the assistance of the representatives of the workers, in every country, in 
the legislative assemblies, in municipal governments, and, in certain 
circumstances, in the national administration itself. However [...] the party 
must not make a declaration in advance on its future participation in the 
assembly, since such a decision would be premature without considering each 
particular situation.&#8221;<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Kuusinen&#8217;s positions are even more relevant insofar as he soon 
abandoned the left to become a &#8220;Leninist&#8221; and, later, a &#8220;Stalinist&#8221;: he was to 
be one of the signers of the dissolution of the Communist International in 1943. 
Rather than an organization or organizations, the left was a tendency which was 
generally stifled by the negative development of the class struggle.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h6">Great Britain</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The British revolutionary movement was, like that of other 
countries, characterized by regionalism. Proletarians in London, Wales and 
Scotland never managed to unite. Irish communism, for its part, was consumed by 
nationalism.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> In London,<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> the Workers Socialist Federation originated in 
radical feminism. S. Pankhurst came to the East End in 1913 to engage in 
feminist activities and while involved in social work rapidly became interested 
in the social question, began to participate in rent strikes and workers 
strikes, and opposed business and state in relation to the war. The Women&#8217;s 
Suffrage Federation became the Women&#8217;s Socialist Federation, and then the 
Workers Socialist Federation, and made contacts with radical workers and 
shop-stewards, but its membership was still largely restricted to London. Its 
journal, <i>The Workers Dreadnought</i>, is one of the best sources of 
information on the workers movement of that era: the WSF would remain the 
organization of a newspaper with correspondents, distributors, etc., and would 
never advance beyond this stage. It supported the Communist International and 
published numerous pamphlets by the Bolsheviks and other revolutionaries. The 
WSF initiated discussions with the other principle groups which would form the 
British Communist Party: the British Socialist Party and the Socialist Labour 
Party. The BSP accepted both parliamentarism and affiliation with the Labour 
Party: it was a social democratic remnant which, in England prior to 1914, could 
produce only a small organization with a few thousand members. The SLP, similar 
to the American DeLeonist SLP (cf. Chapter 9) was also small but was closer to 
the working class. It accepted parliamentarism but rejected affiliation with 
Labour: it would later be split, and the faction still defending this position 
would leave. After this split, the foundation of the Communist Party became 
possible. The Communist International made these two points (affiliation and 
parliamentarism) the criteria for proper tactics in England: the British case is 
truly a good illustration of its shift towards the right. Lenin, in his letter 
to Pankhurst<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> of August 28, 1919, said that &#8220;the question of parliamentarism 
is actually a particular point of secondary importance&#8221;. In 1920, Lenin was in 
favor of &#8220;one party, based on all the decisions of the Third International&#8221;, 
which excluded the left.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In effect, the WSF rejected both parliamentarism and affiliation, 
and formed its own Communist Party in May of 1920, but it merged with the 
official Communist Party of Great Britain, founded a few months later, only to 
quickly leave it and form an ephemeral &#8220;Communist Workers Party&#8221;. <i>The Workers 
Dreadnought</i> went into decline in 1922 and 1923, and disappeared in 1924. 
After 1920, the militant workers who were members of the WSF rapidly left it and 
ended up accepting more moderate positions, as in the case of H. Pollitt, the 
future English Thorez. Pankhurst would soon abandon the revolutionary movement. 
As a communist, she always based herself on experience. Her radical positions 
were not based on reason, with reference to the movement&#8217;s tradition, but 
referred to the experience which gave rise to it and verified what she said. 
Insofar as it was by no means a matter of intellectual progress, her evolution 
is of interest. She moved close to communism under the pressure of events and 
left it when communism collapsed as a practical movement.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile, the Scottish and Welsh movements were undergoing their 
own evolution. In Scotland, the Shop-Stewards Movement was born in 1915-1916 
among skilled metal workers fighting to preserve the advantages they had gained 
with the onset of the war and who were therefore compelled by this circumstance 
to launch actions which were radical in terms of their <i>form</i>.<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a> The 
Scottish movement, which was very combative, would never manage to go beyond 
these limits and continued under the leadership of the Shop-Stewards. Comparable 
to the German revolutionary shop stewards (<i>Revolutionäre Obleute: RO</i>), 
the Shop-Stewards formed a parallel trade unionism<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a> due to the inability of 
the trade unions to defend their demands: the SSM would quickly enter the orbit 
of the CPGB, accepting its ideological control in a National Minority Movement 
which was formed to conquer the trade unions. Some working class areas in Wales, 
however, were characterized by their own unique traits. Dominated by one 
industry (mining), they stubbornly rejected traditional politics (hence their 
rejection of affiliation with Labour) but were unable to advocate anything 
besides &#8220;the mines to the miners&#8221;. This led to a most virulent and combative 
syndicalism, which was not defeated until the failure of the 1926 General 
Strike. In Scotland and Wales, however, abortive attempts to create Communist 
Labour Parties, which were against both parliamentarism and affiliation with the 
Labour Party, did take place in 1920. The CPGB, however, quickly assumed the 
role of the only national political force of the extreme left, and the SSM that 
of the only workers group of importance. In contrast, the only current close to 
the German Left, which had formed around G. Aldred in Glasgow, a Marxist 
influenced by anarchism, who had been advocating the creation of a new 
International since 1906 and had criticized Pankhurst for joining the CPGB, 
supported the left, but would never overcome its status as a small sect.<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h7">The United States</a></h3>

<p class="fst">While the Bolsheviks were relatively unknown prior to 1917 in the 
United States,<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a> the theoreticians of the Dutch SDP, on the other hand, 
contributed to the <i>International Socialist Review</i> and the <i>New Review</i>, 
where Pannekoek published <i>The Downfall of the International</i> in November 
1914. Rutgers, having arrived in the U.S. in 1915, extended the SDP&#8217;s influence. 
One of the characteristics of the American revolutionary movement (in the south 
as well as the north) was the enormous impact of the foreign-born population. 
The most radical groups were often socialist organizations composed of 
immigrants, generally from Russia or Central Europe. These immigrants would 
exercise a considerable influence in the evolution of the two American socialist 
parties, the reformist Socialist Party, and the smaller DeLeonist Socialist 
Labor Party. DeLeon died in 1914: his party did not follow the SP&#8217;s policy of 
acquiescing to the sacred union, but was a centrist group quite distant from the 
Zimmerwaldian Left.</p>

<p class="fst">The Latvian Socialist Federation, which had affiliated with the 
Socialist Party, moved towards the left: in Europe the Latvian Socialist Party 
was an ally of the Bolsheviks. But the Socialist Propaganda League, created by 
the left in 1915, did not want a split. Rutgers played a major role within this 
current, which at that time did not reject either parliamentarism or the idea of 
the party, but wanted to organize the class on the basis of &#8220;industrial 
unionism&#8221;. Industrial unionism was by this definition opposed to trade unionism 
(unionism organized by trade): the industrial trade unions were to unite all the 
workers. These were still trade unions, however, since the term &#8216;union&#8217; was not 
synonymous with the German <i>Union</i>. The SLP supported anti-electoral 
parliamentary action, and advocated &#8220;mass action&#8221;. One notes here the influence 
of Pannekoek.<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a> In 1913, Lewis defined mass action in these terms: &#8220;True mass 
action is situated outside of the sphere of parliamentary action.&#8221; On the other 
hand, Lenin was unknown until the war: Russian immigrants (Kollontai, Bukharin, 
and Trotsky) would later begin to make the Americans aware of Russian debates.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1917, the left had coalesced around Fraina&#8217;s <i>The New 
International</i>, largely financed by Rutgers, and <i>The Class Struggle</i>, 
somewhat less radical, with Boudin and Lore: only Fraina&#8217;s journal spoke of 
October 1917, which it characterized as a great movement of &#8220;industrial 
unionism&#8221;. J. Reed, born in comfortable surroundings, journalist of the Mexican 
revolution, declared his support for the Bolsheviks. He was sincere: others were 
not so sincere, like the journalist L. Steffens, who declared: &#8220;I have seen the 
future, and it works.&#8221; Reactions of this kind, typical of the disillusion 
suffered in 1914-1918, were frequent: they turned to Russia and, from the 
communist point of view, its most superficial aspects, such as the soviet 
democracy, which was later identified by many with the power of the party. These 
aspects were viewed as a source of vitality, a cure for decadence. Sorel, like 
Steffens, admired Lenin before admiring Mussolini. Communism was a new 
adventure. The most solid individuals moved towards the communist left (which is 
to say, towards Lenin, during this period), but the majority &#8220;joined&#8221; communism 
and committed themselves to the cause of the workers. Others would remain 
faithful to the heroic epoch, without going any further: such as Rosmer (cf. 
Chapter 11).</p>

<p class="fst">The foreign language federations&#8217; share of SP membership grew 
from 35% in 1917 to 53% in 1919. There were three great strikes in 1919. The 
Seattle General Strike&#8212;the first ever in the U.S.&#8212;paralyzed the entire city. The 
miners strike in Butte (Montana) was led by a &#8220;council of soldiers, sailors and 
workers&#8221; in which almost all of Butte&#8217;s trade unions participated. As in Europe, 
&#8220;councils&#8221; or &#8220;soviets&#8221; were being formed at that time as organizations of all 
the workers, transcending trade union divisions, with a view to a long struggle, 
but not as insurrectionary organs. Only the 16-week strike by 30,000 textile 
workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts ended in victory. In the U.S.A., as 
elsewhere, communists organized themselves during a moment of intense struggle, 
and not one of a rising revolutionary movement: September 1919, when the two 
Communist Parties were founded (cf. below), was also when the great steel strike 
ended in defeat. With the decapitation of the IWW (cf. Chapter 9), the years 
1918-1920 did indeed constitute a phase of class struggle, but one which 
benefited the bourgeoisie. The &#8220;Red Scare&#8221; did not signify the existence of a 
real threat to the bourgeoisie, but revolutionary weakness.</p>

<p class="fst">At the beginning of 1919, the left began to coalesce but 
hesitated at the prospect of a split. Its generally &#8220;syndicalist&#8221; orientation 
was attenuated in its officially-approved texts, but remained close to 
DeLeonism. The majority of its 70,000 members and sympathizers were from the 
foreign language federations: the Russians were the most numerous, followed by 
the Latvians. At its June 1919 Conference, the majority of the left refused to 
break with the party: the minority chose to leave. The Left Wing Conference&#8217;s 
Manifesto was still DeLeonist: the AFL must be destroyed, parliamentarism is 
worthless except in assisting &#8220;mass strikes&#8221;, and the future society was to be 
organized by the &#8220;unions&#8221;.<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Russian Federation, the animating spirit of the left wing 
minority, attracted part of the majority faction, which then became the 
minority. On September 1, the supporters of the new organization, together with 
Fraina, founded the Communist Party of America. On September 2, Reed and his 
friends, expelled from the Socialist Party, founded the Communist Labor Party of 
America: after tumultuous debate, it rejected unification with the Communist 
Party. As elsewhere, the social democratic past weighed heavily: Reed&#8217;s 
position, &#8220;Fight for the conquest of power&#8221;, only won by 46 votes to 22. The 
Communist Party was divided into three factions: &#8220;Russian&#8221;, &#8220;American&#8221; and the 
&#8220;ex-Michigan group&#8221;. Scorning &#8220;economic&#8221; struggles and privileging education and 
propaganda, the latter tendency was close to the Socialist Party of Great 
Britain and the Socialist Party of Canada. It also maintained that capitalism 
had been strengthened by the war, a position contested by the Communist Party 
majority. More &#8220;socialist&#8221; than &#8220;communist&#8221;, this current was the survival of an 
orthodox social democratic tradition (Kautsky), even if it was closer to reality 
than the other factions of the Communist Party, precisely on account of its 
rejection of revolution. Within the Communist Party, the Russians and the 
ex-Michigan group were against unification with the CLP. Both Communist Parties 
together had between 25,000 and 40,000 members.<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a></p>

<p class="fst">They actually had much in common. According to Reed, &#8220;the program 
of the Communist Party is basically theoretical and more general, while that of 
the CLP adheres to the principles established by the First Congress of the Third 
International... The CP is more political, while the CLP&#8217;s program is more 
connected with the workers economic struggles.&#8221; The two programs admirably 
complemented one another; it was advisable to elaborate a &#8220;workers program&#8221;.<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a> 
The CLP defended a position close to that of the IWW in relation to the trade 
unions, while the CP considered the AFL to be a &#8220;bastion of capitalism&#8221;. &#8220;Every 
strike must be a revolution in miniature...&#8221; announced <i>The Revolutionary Age</i> 
(CLP), which criticized the strikers of the steel mills for having allowed the 
mill owners to collect trade union dues: this is what the AFL was trying to 
impose upon the workers. This paper asserted, however, that &#8220;the revolution is 
at stake in the steel strike&#8221;. For <i>The Communist</i> (CP): &#8220;trade unionism is 
the proletariat&#8217;s worst enemy. One of the tasks of the CP is to destroy the 
existing trade union organizations.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The local and regional labor parties formed during the strike 
tried to unite in November 1919. This could be viewed as being similar to the 
efforts of the German <i>RO</i> or the shop stewards: tempered in the fights 
against the trade union apparatus, the militant workers tried to organize 
themselves <i>as workers</i>. According to the CLP (1919) the problem was 
expressed as follows: &#8220;The organization of a Labor Party by the trade unions is 
an inferior form of proletarian agitation, in order to preserve the advantages 
the trade unions have acquired as a privileged caste. Laborism represents as 
great a danger to the proletariat as moderate petty-bourgeois socialism...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">As for parliament, the IWW tradition, as well as the whole 
radical movement in its early days, supported the boycott: the majority of the 
members of the foreign language federations were not even American citizens. 
Even so, some communists had previously participated in elections in opposition 
to the candidates of the Socialist Party right wing. It was decided that the 
party would participate in the <i>campaign</i> without running any <i>candidates</i>. 
The communist slogan in the 1919 elections was &#8220;boycott the elections&#8221;. &#8220;At a 
time when the proletariat&#8217;s present tendency towards mass action must be 
reinforced, the elections must be boycotted.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">At the end of 1919 repression, which for two years had been 
directed at pacifists and anarchists, fell upon the two Communist Parties, 
already weakened by their divisions. The ex-Michigan group left the Communist 
Party at the beginning of 1920. In April, another split took place: the majority 
of the &#8220;Americans&#8221; and a minority of &#8220;foreigners&#8221; left the Communist Party and 
took the name &#8220;CCP&#8221;, with a party journal of the same name (<i>The Communist</i>). 
Ruthenberg accused the original Communist Party of defending principles which 
were out of touch with reality, and of attempting to be the &#8220;party of action&#8221;. 
The original Communist Party responded to his accusations.<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The exhortation to be in &#8216;contact with the masses&#8217; contains 
within it the germs of compromise, of deviations and betrayals in the future. It 
is the confused and sentimental cry of those who seem to believe that a 
Communist Party must remain in &#8216;contact with the masses&#8217; in every stage of its 
evolution. They ignore the fact that this tenacious attempt to circulate among 
the masses, at a moment when the masses are not prepared, will reduce communism 
to a theory and practice in conformity with the approval of politically immature 
masses...&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;These masses, which will join the party as long as the latter 
remains silent concerning the necessity of the <i>use of force</i> to throw the 
bourgeois state in the trashcan, will reject this tactic when the hour of 
revolution arrives. Consequently, these masses, who have not yet cut the Gordian 
Knot which ties them to the socialist ideology of a &#8216;peaceful&#8217; revolution, will 
enter the party, and by their mere numerical weight will oblige the party to 
change the communist character of its propaganda and agitation, and will oblige 
it to revise all of its positions until it adapts to their political ideals, 
which are still in their infancy... Basically, the communist party is not 
composed of members but of ideas... We must try to make our propaganda penetrate 
into the workers environment: but we do not expect immediate success. Good luck 
or bad, we shall continue our agitation, certain that social forces and the 
disintegration of world capitalism after the war ... will compel the masses to 
heed our message.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Ruthenberg and the CLP entered into discussions about uniting 
their organizations. The question of the use of violence was passionately 
debated, but the most sensitive issue was still <i>industrial unionism</i>. Both 
groups were in agreement about the need to support the IWW and to destroy the 
AFL. On the parliamentary question, Ruthenberg distinguished between 
&#8220;legislative and executive functions&#8221;: one could employ the first (without 
fighting for any reforms) but not the second. This thesis was supported by the 
majority by a narrow margin but the boycott was chosen nonetheless for the 1920 
elections: &#8220;When the revolutionary crisis is undermining the illusions of the 
masses concerning capitalist democracy, it is superfluous for the communists to 
direct their agitation towards the destruction of these illusions.&#8221; Thus was 
born the <i>United Communist Party</i>, whose principle journal was <i>The 
Communist</i>: it had between 8,000 and 15,000 members, most of whom were 
foreign-born.</p>

<p class="fst">For its part, the composition of the Communist Party did not 
permit it to take any interest in the trade unions or even the IWW. Its 
radicalism was in part due to a lack of depth and manifested its lack of social 
roots in the proletariat. At the same time, however, it maintained a relative 
distance from day-to-day matters and had a better understanding of certain 
realities.</p>

<p class="fst">The real positions of the Communist International soon became 
known. Its circular of September 1, 1919 stated that parliamentarism is not a 
form of revolutionary state organization, but that revolutionaries could use it 
to prepare for the revolution: this circular became known in the U.S. in January 
1920.<i> Infantile Disorder</i> arrived in the U.S. one year later. The 
Communist International encouraged the American communists to unify their 
forces.</p>

<p class="fst">This period has been described as a &#8220;crisis of communism&#8221;.<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a> 
The world revolution could not indefinitely live vicariously through the Russian 
experiences, which could only be validated by the world revolution. &#8220;Because its 
initial impulse came from the Russian revolution, it rested upon an illusion: 
the illusion of the immanent collapse of the entire capitalist system.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">A unification conference (May 1921) gave birth to the <i>
Communist Party of America</i>. The two parties met there with more or less 
equal but not at all homogeneous forces. The new program followed the Communist 
International line, at least on paper: &#8220;The Communist Party condemns the 
position of those revolutionaries who abandon the existing unions&#8221;: not only did 
it participate in the elections, but its candidates had to propose demonstration 
&#8220;educational measures&#8221;, not so as to win the votes of the bourgeois majority, 
but to advance the cause of the party&#8217;s agitation, propaganda and activities.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h8">Poland</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The Polish Communist Party was formed in December 1918 from the 
Social Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Poland (SDKPL) led by Luxemburg, 
Jogisches and Marchlewski, and the Socialist Party of the Polish Left (PPS-L), 
which had split from Pilsudski&#8217;s nationalist PPS.<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a> Close to the Left 
Mensheviks, the PPS-L did not gravitate toward the Bolsheviks until October 
1917. With its dominant position in the Communist Party, the SDKPL did not 
officially support either the Bolsheviks or the Mensheviks: their &#8220;above all 
factions&#8221; position could be compared to that of Trotsky with whom they disagreed 
on an essential point: the right of national self-determination, which, in the 
case of Poland, was a burning issue.</p>

<p class="fst">As a whole, the SDKPL openly disagreed with Brest-Litovsk: &#8220;It 
seemed to them that inciting the German soldiers who had invaded Russia in 1918 
to revolution was much more important than preventing the military reverses 
which would be endured by revolutionary Russia.&#8221;<a href="#n38" name="fn38" target="_self">[38]</a> Such criticisms persisted 
in the SDKPL until the fall of 1918. At that time it did not advocate the 
defense of the Polish state (which was constituted as a republic in November) 
but a &#8220;merger with revolutionary Russia&#8221;. Its national conference of November 
1918 defended the view that &#8220;the proletariat must be made to see the necessity 
of distinguishing solely and exclusively the camp of the international 
bourgeoisie in opposition to the international proletariat&#8221;. Poland, thanks to 
its minorities which <i>could not be unified</i>, endlessly resorted to 
chauvinism and patriotism: 100,000 Lithuanians, 1,000,000 Germans, 1,500,000 
Ruthenians, 3,000,000 Jews, and 4,000,000 Ukrainians. The SDKPL, however, shared 
certain Spartacist errors by saying, for example, in regards to the Ebert 
government: &#8220;Woe to this government, if it has the intention of stopping the 
revolution!&#8221; As if that government could have been revolutionary. The national 
question alienated the SDKPL from the PPS-L, but they soon came together under 
the pressure of events. The SDKPL&#8217;s anti-national position, and, more generally, 
its &#8220;Luxemburgism&#8221;, constituted an important contribution to the communist left, 
although the Dutch Left had also developed this theme prior to 1914.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1919, the Pole Karsky wrote:<a href="#n39" name="fn39" target="_self">[39]</a> &#8220;In England, the 
revolutionary movement is retarded by the &#8216;Irish question&#8217; ... the proletarian 
revolution tends towards the abolition of the class state and the political 
proletariat cannot consider creating a political class state: its struggle must 
tend towards the creation of a new form of organization: the socialist 
federation of the proletarians of Europe.&#8221; Around the same time, the Finn 
Sirola, without explicitly criticizing Lenin, proved that &#8220;autonomy&#8221; formed the 
basis of &#8220;imperialism&#8221;.<a href="#n40" name="fn40" target="_self">[40]</a> In her posthumously published notes on <i>The 
Russian Revolution</i>, Luxemburg also cited the Finnish, Polish and Ukrainian 
examples. The Leninist position was frequently challenged by revolutionaries 
from subaltern countries which suffered under the anti-revolutionary weight of 
the national question.</p>

<p class="fst">As Mattick has shown,<a href="#n41" name="fn41" target="_self">[41]</a> the Leninist position on this issue is 
derived from Lenin&#8217;s position on democracy and democratic rights. Lenin believed 
in a democratic state in which the workers could carry on their struggle, thus 
remaining faithful to the Second International. His anti-democratic position in 
relation to the content of socialism was still quite limited: he showed, 
especially against Kautsky, that the <i>dictatorship</i> of the proletariat 
realizes the widest <i>democracy</i>. For him, the democratic state is necessary 
for the proletarian struggle: it is the best political form within which the 
workers can organize themselves (which is true) for the struggle against capital 
(which is false) (cf. Chapter 3).</p>

<p class="fst">Luxemburg&#8217;s perspective on revolution and liberation from foreign 
oppression was based on the proletarian movement in Austria, Germany and Russia, 
and not on the kind of national rebellion characteristic of the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> 
century. A national revival would certainly possess a guaranteed force, but if 
it is crowned with success, the workers movement would be paralyzed, or 
destroyed, by the nationalist current which it had unleashed. The creation of a 
Polish national state would not be the solution to the oppression of the 
minorities of the region, because that state would in turn humiliate the 
non-Polish minorities, nor would it be a revolutionary factor.</p>

<p class="fst">In the workers soviets formed at the end of 1918, the Communist 
Party was often as strong as the socialists. It even dominated the Dabrova 
mining region where an ephemeral Red Republic was formed.</p>

<p class="fst">Like the KPD during the same period, the Polish Communist Party 
boycotted the Constituent Assembly (<i>Sejm</i>) in February 1919. It would only 
renounce its abstentionism with difficulty. One of its pamphlets from 1921 would 
still assert: &#8220;the PCP&#8217;s boycott of the 1919 elections for the <i>Sejm</i> was 
justified because there was a chance of moving directly to the struggle for 
power... In such conditions, participation in the elections would have been 
tantamount to a declaration in advance of the result of the struggle...&#8221; That 
same year, two deputies who had previously been members of the PPS and the 
Radical Peasants Party joined the PCP. When the party debated the &#8220;united front&#8221; 
in April of 1922, the left feared that &#8220;the tactic of the united front and the 
formulation of merely partial demands obscures the ultimate goal of the movement 
and in fact leads to the abandonment of the much more profound goals of the 
socialist revolution&#8221;. The left yielded, but even the party&#8217;s majority did not 
accept this tactic until after animated debate. It is curious to note how the 
center opposed the united front with the same arguments (which are utterly 
non-revolutionary) that were used by the center of the French Communist Party 
during the same period: since you have fought against the socialists, they said, 
how can you offer them your hand today? One must distinguish between the radical 
tendency and the attempt to preserve a trademark image.</p>

<p class="fst">The Polish revolutionaries had foreseen that the creation of new 
states would be used to contain proletarians within national frontiers. It would 
also isolate Germany from Russia (cf. the previous chapter). The Polish 
Communist Party was quite firm on this issue at its First Congress: &#8220;... 
proletarian politics rejects all political solutions which depend upon the 
development of a capitalist world, such as autonomy, independence and 
self-determination... For the international camp of the socialist revolution, 
national questions do not exist.&#8221; The Silesian revolutionary movement was 
suffocated by nationalism and confusion as a result of plebiscites. Pilsudski 
seemed to be a prophet, with his mixture of nationalism and &#8220;socialism&#8221;. At that 
time &#8220;national bolshevism&#8221; was an issue not only in Germany, but in the Ukraine 
and Hungary as well.<a href="#n42" name="fn42" target="_self">[42]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Communist International upheld the opposite view. Incapable 
of truly lifting themselves out of <i>their</i> context (destroying the 
multinational state by availing themselves of the nationalist tendencies opposed 
to it), the Bolsheviks had a very poor understanding of the ability of national 
structures (as was the case, in a different framework, with their grasp of the 
power of democratic structures) to squelch the revolution. They believed that 
they had correctly assessed the factor of nationalism, and accused their 
adversaries of &#8220;indifference&#8221;, and of &#8220;imperialism&#8221;, without grasping the 
essential point: a world ruled by capital can only produce <i>capitalist</i> 
national structures.<a href="#n43" name="fn43" target="_self">[43]</a> They thought they had discovered a weak point in the 
world system precisely where the latter was demonstrating its power. Quite soon, 
of course, their position came under the influence of their foreign policy 
(support for Attaturk&#8217;s Turkey and Sun Yat Sen&#8217;s China).</p>

<p class="fst">Under pressure from the Communist International and above all as 
a result of its defeat, the Second Congress of the Polish Communist Party 
(August 1923) evoked the &#8220;defense of the interests of the whole nation&#8221;, under 
threat from the &#8220;offensive of world capitalism&#8221;. Poland, it said, needed an army 
which could eliminate &#8220;non-democratic elements&#8221;. Despite the protests of the 
party&#8217;s left, this line destroyed the PCP as a communist organization. It 
recognized, for example, Poland&#8217;s &#8220;rights&#8221; to Upper Silesia. It is obvious, as 
Bukharin said (cf. Chapter 3) that in this manner it opened the door, within the 
very heart of the revolutionary movement, to imperialism. A direct line connects 
the recognition of the nation to support for its imperialism against other

<h3><a name="h9">Austria-Hungary<a href="#n44" name="fn44" target="_self">[44]</a></a></h3>

<p class="fst">The Austrian Communist Party (KPÖ) was formed in November 1918 
from various groups or informal circles, among them the <i>Linksradikalen</i> 
with roots in the working class and influence in the socialist party, 
anarchists, etc.<a href="#n45" name="fn45" target="_self">[45]</a> The Wertheim group (more or less anarchist) and the <i>
Linksradikalen</i> did not effectively become incorporated into the Communist 
Party, however, until February 1919. Between August 1919 and October 1920, the 
KPÖ confronted the parliamentary question. The majority allowed itself to be 
convinced by Koritschoner, leader of the former <i>Linksradikalen</i>, not to 
participate in parliament; later, in mid-September, he changed his opinion under 
the influence of the Communist International. A social democratic left faction 
then merged with the Communist Party which, with this contribution, had close to 
15,000 members.</p>

<p class="fst">The founding Congress of the KPÖ had opposed the election of a 
constituent assembly by shifting parliamentarism from parliament to the <i>
soviets</i>, which did not resolve the issue.<a href="#n46" name="fn46" target="_self">[46]</a> There was, at that time, a <i>
Volkswehr</i> formed of workers who had been soldiers in the former Austrian 
army. At least one battalion was communist. The Red Guard (radical workers 
organizations) and the soldiers councils formed part of it. But who was in 
command of this army? Who held power? An army was maintained (and consequently a 
State), while the State had not been overthrown. This militia, on the other 
hand, crushed the riot of April 1919 when the police were incapable of doing so. 
The KPÖ also accepted the councils and their National Executive Committee as an 
executive organ. An organization is not revolutionary unless it acts in a 
revolutionary manner: this was not the case in this instance. The 
revolutionaries were, therefore, supporting a capitalist state organ, a new sort 
of capitalist state, but one which was capitalist nonetheless and even more 
dangerous. At the same time, the KPÖ dedicated itself to a series of putsches, 
such as the (unsuccessful) putsch of June-July 1919. This behavior was not 
contradictory: it was because the KPÖ believed that the political regime was 
undermined by a situation of dual power that it carried out sudden assaults to 
definitively destroy it. But it was all in vain: <i>there was no dual power</i>, 
such as had indeed existed in Russia. Developments from February to October of 
1917 in Russia had accentuated the differences and the confrontation between the 
soviets and the government, because the latter was unable to satisfy the needs 
of the masses. This did not happen in Austria: to the contrary, the councils, a 
parallel power, were progressively institutionalized. The only solution, 
therefore, would consist in fighting the (official) council system. That is what 
the KAPD did, but not the KPÖ. The councils cannot be used to exercise the 
dictatorship of the proletariat unless they break with the bourgeoisie and all 
its forms.</p>

<p class="fst">We shall now address the position adopted by the Austrian 
communists on the national question. The position on the national question 
adopted by Koritschoner, one of the leaders of the Austrian Communist Party, can 
be summarized as follows: in opposition to the various currents of the social 
democracy of the former Austria-Hungary, he apparently assumed Lenin&#8217;s slogan: 
the right of national self-determination. However, as one may note from reading 
one of his articles published on May 22, 1920 in <i>Kommunismus</i>, he gave 
this slogan a different meaning from that intended by the Bolsheviks, one which 
was also quite variable in accordance with the situation; in reality, he was 
opposed to the Leninist idea of the nation which united all classes. For 
Koritschoner, what was important in considering any national question was the 
direct interest of the proletariat in the affected regions. He provided as an 
example the series of watchwords which the Austrian communists had broadcast at 
various times: when, at the end of 1918, Germany seemed to be on the verge of 
carrying out the <i>Anschluss</i> revolution, it called for the union of the 
Austrian proletariat with the German proletariat which it seemed might be 
victorious; when the revolution was crushed in Germany (January 1919): 
&#8220;Independence for Austria&#8221;. When the council republic ruled in Hungary, there 
was a German population in the western part of the country. The choice of what 
stance to take became complicated when the two countries which were parties to a 
disputed claim to a region were under bourgeois rule. In this case Koritschoner 
declared that one must decide which country had the best chance for a 
proletarian revolution, the country where the workers councils were more 
advanced, or the country where the reaction was strongest. Thus, the Austrian 
Communist Party opposed the integration of certain Austrian regions into 
Switzerland, the most stable country in the world. Other Austrian regions would 
have chosen to merge with Bavaria prior to May 1919, but the Austrian Communist 
Party defended their retention by Austria when the worst reaction was victorious 
in Bavaria. When there was an &#8220;equilibrium&#8221;, such as was the case of the region 
of Carinthia, claimed by Austria and Yugoslavia, where it was difficult to 
determine which country presented the most favorable situation for the 
proletariat, the party advocated abstention from the referendum, with the 
proviso, however, that in such a case what was important was not so much voting 
for, or against, or abstaining, what was important was not so much the result of 
the referendum, but that the proletariats of the two countries carry out a 
common action in accordance with a joint decision.</p>

<p class="fst">The Austrian Communist Party was therefore extremely flexible in 
its attempt to provide an adequate response to the infinite series of national 
questions which arose in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. In reality, 
however, Koritschoner always based his decisions on the interest of the 
proletariat, and did not recognize the autonomy of the national question in any 
respect&#8212;unlike Lenin. Koritschoner also showed, in respect to western Hungary, 
for example, that this question did not have any autonomy for the bourgeoisie, 
either, who emphasized various national claims, only to later abandon them 
suddenly, depending on which position served the counterrevolution. Lukàcs and 
Gorter, however (cf. the text reproduced below), the German and Dutch Lefts, and 
before them, Luxemburg, had a much clearer understanding of the essentially 
counterrevolutionary character of the newly-created states in the east.</p>

<p class="fst">The phenomenon which we find most interesting is the journal <i>
Kommunismus</i>, and its treatment of the connections between the left in 
Germany and the countries of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, above all 
Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria (cf. below). In Chapter 8, we have already seen 
how official history has over-emphasized the reality of the Hungarian Soviet 
Republic (March-August 1919), and how it underestimated that republic&#8217;s impact 
on revolutionary strategy. Rakosi&#8217;s report at the Second Congress of the 
Communist International reproached the Hungarian Communist Party for having 
&#8220;from the very beginning, committed the grave error of merging with the social 
democratic party&#8221;.<a href="#n47" name="fn47" target="_self">[47]</a> Like the Finnish &#8220;auto-critique&#8221; summarized above, this 
acknowledgement of the failure of socialist-communist collaboration and of the 
first &#8220;workers government&#8221; led to the determination to destroy the social 
democracy. It had been common knowledge since the &#8220;Spartacist Week&#8221; that the 
social democracy would not hesitate to call in the army to kill revolutionaries. 
Now it was known that the German case was not an exception: when social 
democracy found itself compelled to cooperate with the revolution, it did so 
only in order to fight it. In brief, it is as or more dangerous, as Marx said of 
the nationalist leaders of his time (Mazzini, etc.), when it mimics revolution. 
The revolution must destroy social democracy if it does not want to be destroyed 
by it. All &#8220;means&#8221; are to be subordinated to this end. After the revolutionary 
assault and its defeat, however, the opposite conclusion would be deduced from 
the same evidence. Since social democracy was the last resort of the 
counterrevolution, one must not directly confront it but collaborate with it in 
order to unmask it. This deduction, theorized in <i>Infantile Disorder</i>, was 
directed against the revolutionary movement, but corresponded to a phase of 
decline and of adaptation to a <i>non-</i>revolutionary reality. <i>Kommunismus</i>, 
published in Austria after the Hungarian defeat, illustrated this evolution.</p>

<p class="fst">One could consider <i>Kommunismus</i> as a kind of &#8220;semi-official 
office&#8221; of the Communist International.<a href="#n48" name="fn48" target="_self">[48]</a> Its subtitle presents it as the 
organ of the Communist International for the countries of southeast Europe. The 
Balkan Federation had also attempted to create a regional center in Sofia (cf. 
Chapter 11). The Hungarians (B. Kun, Reval, Lukàcs, and Varga) made extensive 
contributions to <i>Kommunismus</i>. In the spring of 1920 an article by Lukàcs 
appeared in the journal, on the topic of parliamentarism, which he conceived of 
as merely a defensive weapon.<a href="#n49" name="fn49" target="_self">[49]</a> His manner of opposing councils and parliament 
(cf. the KPÖ) was criticized by <i>Il Soviet</i> (journal of the Italian 
abstentionists) in a brief note which accompanied a translation of Lukàcs&#8217;s 
article. Another article by B. Kun advocated an &#8220;active boycott&#8221; motivated by 
tactical rather than principled reasons, a distinction rejected by Lukàcs. <i>
Kommunismus</i> also published texts of the Amsterdam Bureau, without ever 
entirely endorsing the theses of the Left. In June 1920, Lenin discovered 
&#8220;indubitable symptoms&#8221;, of infantile disorder in this journal, and defined the 
&#8220;active boycott&#8221; as &#8220;perfect&#8221;.<a href="#n50" name="fn50" target="_self">[50]</a> But the journal was, rather than a doctrinal 
center, a point of convergence, and rapidly regressed along with the situation 
in general. The frequently highly abstract character of Lukàcs&#8217;s articles 
testified to the journal&#8217;s shallow social penetration (for which we cannot blame 
him) and revealed that the journal was a theoretical base and not the 
theoretical expression of an active practical movement. From this perspective, 
it is not at all comparable to the organs of the German Left. This degree of 
separation and abstraction soon allowed Lukàcs to identify party and class, and 
later party-institution and party-program, as his later evolution would 
demonstrate, especially his work <i>Lenin</i> (1924). But in 1920, the debate 
had not yet been resolved, and the left still exercised some seduction over the 
journal&#8217;s collaborators who oscillated between the Communist International and 
the German Left, while the journal itself leaned more towards the Communist 
International. But its most important feature was the fact that its distinctive 
manner of theoretically comprehending the left did not correspond to a 
deeply-rooted movement. It was more a reflection rather than the theorization of 
experience.</p>

<p class="fst">The September 1920 issue of <i>Kommunismus</i> contained a 
critique of the KAPD written by A. Maslow (KPD left). On October 26, commenting 
on the Halle Congress where the USPD majority voted to merge with the KPD, 
Lukàcs saw this as a &#8220;process of sorting-out&#8221;. He wanted the USPD left, &#8220;and 
also, very soon (as we hope), the revolutionary elements of the KAPD&#8221; to join 
the KPD. After Wolffheim, Laufenberg and Rühle had been excluded from the KAPD, 
Lukàcs repeated his appeal to that party&#8217;s revolutionaries: Levi was pleased, 
and wrote Lukàcs expressing his wish to welcome them... &#8220;The struggle to win 
over the mass of the proletariat is far from over, but there is, nonetheless, a 
mass party of the proletariat&#8221;, Lukàcs responded, without taking into account 
the fact that this method was transforming the party into an entity which was 
above all real relations.</p>

<p class="fst">Roland-Holst, who published a series of articles entitled &#8220;The 
Tasks of the Communist Party in the Proletarian Revolution&#8221; in early 1921, 
represented the tendency which was moving towards the left without truly and 
thoroughly embracing it: in theoretical form, it was the precise expression of 
the actual practice of the proletarians. We should not copy the Russian 
Communist Party: European conditions are different, she explained, explicitly 
referring to the <i>Open Letter to Comrade Lenin</i>. The masses/leaders 
relation is different in Europe. Here, the masses will realize the &#8220;dictatorship 
of the proletariat&#8221; or &#8220;proletarian democracy&#8221; by means of actively involved 
soviets in order to play the dominant role, while in Russia the party plays the 
dominant role. The function of the leaders (<i>Führer</i>) will be of lesser 
importance in Europe. Her last article concludes with a quasi-eulogy of the KAPD 
which she defends (almost in the past tense) as a combative movement. She 
recalls Luxemburg&#8217;s critique of the Bolsheviks and then ends: &#8220;They have dared!&#8221; 
But this halfway position is indefensible. It can only be understood from the 
perspective of a possible recovery in Europe, which would change the balance of 
forces in the Communist International, whose new position would then constitute 
a dynamic factor. Roland-Holst&#8217;s prudence can be explained by her intention not 
&#8220;to smash this machine to pieces&#8221;, referring to the Communist International, 
which could still be useful.</p>

<p class="fst">Commenting on the consequences of the March Action in an article 
on communist self-criticism and Levi&#8217;s downfall (May 1, 1921), Reval anticipated 
the Trotsky of 1938:<a href="#n51" name="fn51" target="_self">[51]</a> &#8220;The crisis of the German party is the crisis of its 
leadership (<i>die Krise der Führer</i>), it is a moral crisis.&#8221; He admitted 
that the KAPD would never even have existed were it not for the opportunism of 
the KPD, but concluded from this fact that the KAPD would take over the 
leadership of the German revolution and that &#8220;the KAPD&#8217;s left radicalism will be 
definitively liquidated&#8221;. On the same topic, Lukàcs established a parallel 
between the economic crisis affecting the bourgeoisie, and the ideological 
crisis (a crisis of consciousness and thus of the party) affecting the 
proletariat. &#8220;The mass party is only a precondition for the revolution.&#8221; 
Idealism and reformism would not take long to merge into what would be called 
&#8220;Stalinism&#8221;, justified theoretically and then superficially criticized by 
Lukàcs.</p>

<h3><a name="h10">Bulgaria</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Founded in 1891, the Bulgarian Socialist Party was split in 
1902-1903 between the &#8220;narrows&#8221; (left) and the &#8220;liberals&#8221; (right). Until 1914 
the two parties together had between 1500 and 2000 members; they were primarily 
propaganda organizations.<a href="#n52" name="fn52" target="_self">[52]</a> Their split also divided the trade unions. The 
unions were very weak (their active membership was composed of 70,000 artisans 
and 93,000 wage workers in 1910). The &#8220;liberals&#8221; defended Bulgaria&#8217;s entry into 
the war on the side of the central European empires, while the &#8220;narrows&#8221;, in 
1916, advocated a break with the Second International, but did not accept the 
slogan of turning the war into a civil war until after October 1917. They 
supported the founding of the Communist International and in May 1919 formed the 
Bulgarian Communist Party, led by Blagoev, which had more than 20,000 members, 
of whom 2,200 were industrial workers, and organized 13,000 workers in the trade 
unions which it controlled.</p>

<p class="fst">The war was very unpopular in Bulgaria: ruinous and badly-led, it 
was accompanied by an influx of Germans and Austrians who treated the country 
like a semi-colony. A rebellion broke out and a republican army was formed which 
advanced upon the capital before being defeated in September 1918. The &#8220;narrow&#8221; 
faction did not consider this movement to be a proletarian movement and did not 
participate in it.<a href="#n53" name="fn53" target="_self">[53]</a> Later, from 1919 to 1923, the country was ruled by the 
dictatorship of Stamboulisky&#8217;s Peasant Party, which organized a peasant militia, 
and was detested and feared by both the petty-bourgeoisie and the workers. This 
regime was not conducive to the differentiation of political tendencies, and 
clandestine conditions often mixed socialists, communists and anarchists 
together. The anarchists exercised some influence on the left communists. The 
anarchists were divided into two tendencies: one, peasant and communitarian, 
close to the views of Makhno and the Andalusian libertarian communists; the 
other, based in the cities and anarchosyndicalist, whose stronghold was Varna. 
The first was primarily dedicated to propaganda, the second to organizing the 
workers. The anarchists were numerous but did not have a national organization. 
The anarchists who were closer to communism and were calling for both CNT-type 
organizations and German-style <i>unions</i> joined the Communist Party, from 
which they would later be excluded or would join the Communist Party Left. The 
anarchists also had some influence in a few trade unions (longshoremen).</p>

<p class="fst">Between December 1919 and February 1920, a great strike of 
railway workers and postal employees took place, and was defeated by force: 
several thousand railway workers were dismissed. The Communist Party acted in an 
excessively prudent manner in the opinion of its left faction: the Communist 
International, however, encouraged the Communist Party to support Stamboulisky, 
who was presented as at least leading a popular movement. Under the leadership 
of I. Ganchev, a party fraction with about 1,000 members was formed, which 
denounced parliamentarism, blaming it for the Communist Party&#8217;s 
accommodationism. Indeed, from 1919 to 1923, the Communist Party had overtaken 
the socialist party and became the leading opposition party in the Bulgarian 
parliament.</p>

<p class="fst">In May of 1920, without &#8220;intending to show any disrespect to this 
exemplary party&#8221;, Sidarov tried &#8220;to call attention to the deviations in the 
tactics and principles of the Third International&#8221; in an article published by <i>
Kommunismus</i>.<a href="#n54" name="fn54" target="_self">[54]</a> &#8220;Just as in western Europe, the contradictions which are 
appearing in Bulgaria are the fruit of the old tradition of the leadership of 
the movement and of the absence of a truly revolutionary tradition. Peaceful 
evolution within the bourgeois state has left its mark on the psychology and the 
revolutionary initiatives of the communist leadership in Bulgaria. At the same 
time, it is generally believed in western Europe that the economic development 
of Bulgaria is almost insignificant ... even if it is true that its development 
is not progressing on an extensive scale, one must nonetheless point out that it 
is strong enough for its tendencies to be suitable for the social and economic 
life of this country as a whole.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This argument constituted a refutation in advance of all the 
justifications for a non-communist policy due to the backwardness and the 
specific conditions characteristic of largely unindustrialized regions. Bordiga, 
prior to 1924, defended an analogous position in respect to southern Italy.<a href="#n55" name="fn55" target="_self">[55]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The uprising of a part of the army in September 1918, under the 
slogan, &#8220;Work, Bread and Return Home&#8221;, was defeated &#8220;by the unified power of the 
bourgeoisie&#8221;. While enumerating other conflicts, Sidarov asserted that the 
necessity of struggle &#8220;is so strong among the masses that it obliges the 
communist party to intervene in this struggle, even if this constitutes an 
exception. We deliberately say that the Communist Party only exceptionally 
commits itself to this struggle. During the September events, for example, it 
held a party conference during the course of which, frankly, it never addressed 
these events.&#8221; The absence of a united revolutionary leadership favored 
Stamboulisky&#8217;s freedom of action.</p>

<p class="fst">In January 1921, the minority founded the Communist Workers 
Party, whose journal, <i>Rabotnicheska Iskra</i>, was published in Varna. 
Attending the Third World Congress, the CWP of Bulgaria, like the KAPD, was not 
admitted as a member into the Communist International (not even in a 
consultative role). It established contacts with the KAPD, which supported it. 
In April 1922 it joined the Communist Workers International (cf. Appendix I). In 
June of 1921, the official Communist Party asserted that the CWP had been 
&#8220;definitively liquidated&#8221;<a href="#n56" name="fn56" target="_self">[56]</a> and that its members had returned to the Communist 
Party, but this declaration appears to have been quite exaggerated. The 
Bulgarian Left was the expression of a tragedy, understanding this term in the 
sense of a contradiction without a solution (at least one which did not lie in a 
distant future): it wanted to go on &#8220;the offensive&#8221;, knowing that 
parliamentarism would fail, but it remained impotent.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h11">An International Communist Left?</a></h3>

<p class="fst">This chapter&#8217;s &#8220;disjointed&#8221; form reflects the absence of 
relations between the lefts of the various countries; each practically ignored 
the other. The Italians, for instance, reproduced articles by Pannekoek, Gorter 
and Pankhurst in <i>Il Soviet</i>, but never devoted any space to a common 
elaboration of activities in Western Europe. One cannot explain this dispersion 
as being due to a lack of information. This lack of information, the absence of 
an interest in establishing and maintaining contacts, reflects a situation where 
the revolutionary movement remained circumscribed within small areas, each of 
which had its own problems.</p>

<p class="fst">There was no international left; there was, at most, a tendency 
for its future continuation.<a href="#n57" name="fn57" target="_self">[57]</a> The lack of simultaneity of events within 
national contexts and their respective evolutions impeded the exchange of 
information. In Germany, certain truths would be revealed sooner than in other 
countries, but this precocity condemned the German Left to isolation. The full 
extent of the opportunism of the Communist International had not yet become 
apparent in the other countries. By the time it was fully displayed, both the 
German Left as well as the German proletariat had already been defeated, despite 
a few final outbursts. An article signed &#8220;W.M.&#8221; which appeared in the <i>
International Youth Correspondence</i> (June 10, 1921), on &#8220;the crisis of the 
Communist International and the Young Communists&#8221;, spoke of expelling the 
opportunists and sought the &#8220;reintegration of those groups which had acted with 
too much freedom (the KAPD tendencies), who, for that very reason, will be won 
over for the great revolutionary task&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">The process which led to the successive formation of left 
fractions also led to their being destroyed one after another, and the KAI (cf. 
Appendix I) was incapable of playing a coordinating role. The KAI was a site for 
theoretical encounters and not an organ for coordinating international activity. 
After 1921, the Italian Left received the same treatment which had been imposed 
upon the Germans: the Communist International compelled it to mix centrists and 
communists in the same party. But the Italian Left did not understand this. It 
would face the same problems as the German Left: anti-fascism, united front, 
fusion with the centrists, workers government. Except in respect to the trade 
union and national questions (which were certainly of capital importance), it 
would basically respond in the same way as the German Left: often with more 
precision, since the reaction of the German Left was situated on a more 
practical level, corresponding to the effective experience of the class, and 
sought, where it could do so, a response in action. The Italian Left had 
theoretically extended the theoretical-practical critique of the Germans. It was 
as remote from the Communist International and the Russian Communists as the 
German Left was. But the opposition of the Italian Communist Party came later, 
or in any case <i>appeared</i> to come later, the Italians not having grasped 
the immensity of their differences with the Communist International. The Italian 
Left would misunderstand its relation to the German Left as much as it would 
misunderstand its relation to Lenin.</p>

<p class="fst">It is true that some authors, such as A. Kriegel, consider the 
communist left, which they call the &#8220;ultra-left&#8221;, as something like a vast 
current which derived from the anarchists, at a time when the latter were close 
to the Communist International and even the Italian Communist Party during its 
early days.<a href="#n58" name="fn58" target="_self">[58]</a> But Kriegel conceals the differences within this current and 
concludes by totally deforming it to the point of making any differentiations 
disappear: to include under this rubric the experiences of Munich and Hungary is 
a monstrous caricature which even a sub-Leninist polemicist would not have 
considered. To speak of an &#8220;international communist left&#8221; is not to impose a 
structure on a multitude of movements which are as varied as they are unlike one 
another. It is obvious that the revolutionary &#8220;solution&#8221; for the epoch could not 
have consisted in a mindless agglomeration of all these tendencies. Only a 
minority had arrived at a (relatively) correct view and had tried to act on that 
basis. The &#8220;German&#8221; and &#8220;Italian&#8221; communist lefts had in part cleared the way 
for communist perspectives, while the anarchists and revolutionary syndicalists 
of all stripes remained trapped in the past, even though a considerable number 
of them were revolutionaries. Even the German and Italian Lefts were still the 
prisoners of serious errors. Confusion reigned <i>everywhere</i>, but it was not 
shared <i>equally</i>. Spartacism and Bolshevism were both hybrids halfway 
between the revolution and centrism. This contradiction would be resolved. After 
the twilight of the movement, their radical aspects (which constituted an always 
living contribution: internationalism for the former, revolutionary defeatism 
and the question of the state for the latter) lost their importance to the 
benefit of positions inherited from their social democratic origins, which can 
be summarized as follows: win over the majority of the workers. Little by 
little, most militants turned towards reformism and became integrated into the 
party apparatus, in the KPD as in the RCP.</p>

<p class="fst">The fragmentation of the left reflected the weakness of the 
proletariat. Depending on the original experiences of the various countries, the 
revolutionaries managed to clarify some issues and remained confused about 
others. If the proletariat had manifested proofs of its internationalism and had 
truly acted on a worldwide scale, the left would have been enriched and would 
have developed alongside it: but this did not happen. At the time, the only 
trait common to the proletarians of the different countries was their attachment 
to <i>democracy</i> (cf. Chapter 4). Later, proletarian atomization led to the 
fragmentation of the left groups and their descent into sectarianism (cf. 
Appendix I).</p>

<p class="fst">One of the criteria which differentiated the German Left from the 
other manifestations of the communist left is undoubtedly the trade union 
question. Only the Dutch-German Left understood that it was impossible for the 
workers to ever again create permanent revolutionary workers organizations. Many 
left communists were supporters of &#8220;industrial unions&#8221; but did not see the 
connection linking classical and industrial trade unions, and even expected that 
the former would be transformed into the latter, and defended systematic 
activity within the trade unions.<a href="#n59" name="fn59" target="_self">[59]</a> Even though DeLeon worked in the old trade 
unions, he wanted to create new workers organizations.<a href="#n60" name="fn60" target="_self">[60]</a> The national question 
is the other differentiating criterion. At that time the German Left groups 
devoted little attention to the national question, but they conceived of it in 
essentially the same terms as the SDKPL, although Pannekoek opposed Luxemburg&#8217;s 
position on imperialism (cf. Chapter 3).<a href="#n61" name="fn61" target="_self">[61]</a> Today the national and trade union 
questions are two crucial criteria to determine whether an orientation is 
clinging to the bygone past or preparing for the revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">In retrospect, the Italian Left is considered by the German Left 
as one more variant of the much-detested Leninism. Reciprocally, the Italian 
Left considers the German Left as a variety of anarchosyndicalism. These 
conflicting interpretations allow the representatives, either official or 
unofficial, of these traditions to avoid the question of their <i>common origin</i>. 
Where a double supersession was necessary, the defenders of each current instead 
became addicted to their own particular special characteristics.</p>

<p class="fst">What is extraordinary about these polemics is the mutual 
ignorance of the real nature of the objects of their attacks. Bordiga, in 
articles from 1955-1957, compared the KAPD to the revolutionary 
syndicalists.<a href="#n62" name="fn62" target="_self">[62]</a> In his texts he frequently compared the German Left to the 
Gramscian current. In fact, Gramsci distinguished between &#8220;industrial power&#8221; and 
&#8220;political power&#8221;. In its worst formulations, the KAPD did consider that taking 
power in the workplace <i>precedes</i> taking political power. In other 
formulations, it presents the matter as two parallel moments. But the ambiguity 
persisted. In its weakest and most dangerous form, this conception leads to 
making the struggle against the state equivalent to the action of the economic 
organizations: the rank and file workers organizations would be strong enough to 
&#8220;make the exercise of counter-violence superfluous or at least secondary&#8221;, 
DeLeon thought.<a href="#n63" name="fn63" target="_self">[63]</a> The texts and above all the practice of the German Left 
prove, however, that it never reduced &#8220;political&#8221; to &#8220;economic&#8221;. There are, of 
course, traces of revolutionary syndicalism in Bergmann&#8217;s intervention at the 
Third World Congress, for example,<a href="#n64" name="fn64" target="_self">[64]</a> but they always recalled the danger of 
losing the <i>global</i> perspective. The same delegate criticized the IWW and 
the factory occupations in Italy in 1920. It would be <i>absurd</i> to base 
one&#8217;s opinion on the <i>texts</i> without explaining them within the context of 
the effective practice of the German proletarians,<a href="#n65" name="fn65" target="_self">[65]</a> with which, however, the 
Italian Left was indeed familiar and could explain quite well when it wanted 
to.<a href="#n66" name="fn66" target="_self">[66]</a> Revolutionary journalism and other works are not a &#8220;photographic&#8221; 
reflection of a movement: they always present a distorted expression, especially 
since the proletariat is not manifested in its <i>entirety</i>, and remains 
separated without any real international action. The sense of the totality was 
therefore easily lost. The German Left had committed far fewer &#8220;errors&#8221; than the 
Communist International, and no more than the Italian Left. Despite its apparent 
rigor, the Communist International had provided no solutions for the problems 
faced by the world proletariat. The communist left, both German and Italian, 
tried to do so, and was at least partly successful.</p>

<p class="fst">The Italian Left, like the groups comprising the German Left, 
opposed, for example, the English communists&#8217; affiliation with the Labour 
Party,<a href="#n67" name="fn67" target="_self">[67]</a> but insisted on showing that its disagreement with Lenin on this 
point was of secondary importance, since his position contained the <i>
principled theses</i> which far transcended this particular issue.<a href="#n68" name="fn68" target="_self">[68]</a> Lenin&#8217;s 
position in this case rests on the idea (justly refuted by the Italian Communist 
Party) that social democracy was the right wing of the workers movement, rather 
than one of the forms assumed by capital. The Italian Left likewise insisted on 
the masses-leaders opposition, so beloved by the German Left.<a href="#n69" name="fn69" target="_self">[69]</a> The KAPD 
attempted, above all, to promote the most wide-ranging proletarian action 
possible. Its activity was not, in any event, any more <i>unilateral</i> than 
constantly repeating the necessity of the <i>party</i>. The German and Italian 
Lefts did not possess a correct representation of what they were doing, since 
each interpreted its own practice with the aid of partially false theories. The 
Germans were prone to democratism, the Italians to the metaphysics of the party, 
although neither could be reduced to either one of these &#8220;deviations&#8221;. The 
organizational question inevitably acquires excessive importance when 
proletarian action is lacking. The masses-leaders distinction (cf. Chapter 14), 
a preoccupation also shared by the Italian Communist Party, while so poorly 
expressed by the Germans, was addressed in just as unsatisfactory a way by the 
Italians with their theorization of the party. This emphasis on the 
masses-leaders opposition was not so much an attempt to guarantee a democratic 
organization, as an effort to prevent the formation of a VKPD-type group or the 
kind of organization the Communist International wanted to impose upon the 
Italian Communist Party. It was this rejection of the masses-leaders 
perspective, despite what he himself thought, which inspired Gorter to write:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Leadership politics is not the politics of leaders and 
centralization&#8212;without which nothing can be obtained, any more than in the 
absence of a party&#8212;but the politics which ... holds that the leaders can be 
victorious if they at least have a large numbers of people behind them.&#8221;<a href="#n70" name="fn70" target="_self">[70]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One could say much the same of the Left&#8217;s educationalism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The real mysticism is ... that of revolutionary parliamentarism, 
which thinks it can educate the working class voters (and in Lenin&#8217;s vision even 
the peasants and the &#8216;functionaries&#8217;) and lead them to believe in the need for 
revolution by means of a well-organized presence in bourgeois institutions.&#8221;<a href="#n71" name="fn71" target="_self">[71]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One could quote innumerable Leninist declarations totally within the 
&#8220;culturalist&#8221; orientation denounced by Bordiga after 1912.<a href="#n72" name="fn72" target="_self">[72]</a> A text from 1919 
has achieved classic status:<a href="#n73" name="fn73" target="_self">[73]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Only parliamentarism, thanks to civilized culture, has allowed 
the oppressed class of the proletarians to become conscious of itself and to 
create a worldwide workers movement. Without parliamentarism, without the 
electoral principle, this evolution of the working class would have been 
impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This combines a partial, Russian point of view with the western 
social democratic deviation in regards to consciousness, education and 
organization as <i>preconditions</i> for action. He would therefore incite the 
western revolutionaries to rejuvenate the trade union movement<a href="#n74" name="fn74" target="_self">[74]</a> in order to 
provide the &#8220;Communist Party&#8221; with a mass trade union<a href="#n75" name="fn75" target="_self">[75]</a> and electoral base.</p>

<p class="fst">The Italian Left&#8217;s organizational fetishism concerning the 
Communist International and its centralized &#8220;discipline&#8221; would continue to 
unfold.<a href="#n76" name="fn76" target="_self">[76]</a> So as not to have to situate itself within the trend towards an 
international left, the Italian Left gave itself adversaries which were no match 
for it, Trotsky and Luxemburg,<a href="#n77" name="fn77" target="_self">[77]</a> in order to avoid confronting the only 
interlocutor of its own stature: the German Left. Such a confrontation did not 
take place at the time. But defeat had such an impact upon a revolutionary of 
Bordiga&#8217;s temperament that he forgot what he had written about the KAPD in 
1920.<a href="#n78" name="fn78" target="_self">[78]</a> Although he did not take the side of the party of the German Left 
against the official KPD, Bordiga did not reject it either and considered it to 
be the most vigorous aspect of the movement in Germany. He judged that it would 
evolve by eliminating its non-Marxist aspects: he did not, therefore, situate it <i>
outside</i> of the &#8220;Marxist&#8221; camp, as if its positions rested upon other <i>
principles</i>. The Italian Left did not identify itself with the German Left, 
but did consider the latter to inhabit a framework of Marxist principles 
identical to its own, and not an anarcho-communist mixture. Urquidi, author of a 
study of the origins of the Italian Communist Party, wrote that<a href="#n79" name="fn79" target="_self">[79]</a> &#8220;A. 
Pannekoek is the only foreign author whose name is frequently repeated in the 
columns of <i>Il Soviet</i>. One could also read various articles by H. Gorter 
and H. Roland-Holst in that journal. It is even more surprising that, from 1918 
to 1921, one does not find even one article by Lenin. The most <i>Il Soviet</i> 
offers in this respect are short extracts from Bukharin and Kollontai, and these 
are the only Russians published in Bordiga&#8217;s journal.&#8221;<a href="#n80" name="fn80" target="_self">[80]</a> We will recall that 
in April 1920 <i>Il Soviet</i> described Pannekoek as an &#8220;excellent theoretician 
of Marxism&#8221; and the KPN as a &#8220;very good communist party&#8221;.<a href="#n81" name="fn81" target="_self">[81]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Upon issuing a <i>Manifesto</i> to rectify the situation 
within the Communist International and the Italian Communist Party, Bordiga 
would judge in 1923 that &#8220;one might think that it would have been better to 
issue this warning sooner. But, as we have said in relation to the matter of 
tactics, the disagreement was imperceptible for quite some time: the Communist 
International&#8217;s method consisted in presenting its own slogans one by one.&#8221;<a href="#n82" name="fn82" target="_self">[82]</a> 
The Italian Communist Party began to fall victim (in this case, as well, due to 
the weakness of the revolution)<a href="#n83" name="fn83" target="_self">[83]</a> to what it had imputed to the German 
communists. But the communist left, in Italy, was the Italian Communist Party. 
The Communist International was confronted by strong resistance from those 
communists who rejected fusion with the centrists (Serrati). But it stubbornly 
persisted. The Italian Socialist Party and the Italian Communist Party were <i>
both</i> invited to send delegates to the Third World Congress.</p>

<p class="fst">Depending on the environment where they are encountered, one 
faction or party is often &#8220;anarchist&#8221; or &#8220;Leninist&#8221; to the other. In early 1920, 
Lenin stated that the Marxist-anarchist opposition had been superseded.<a href="#n84" name="fn84" target="_self">[84]</a> 
Later, in 1921, he definitively catalogued the German Left under the rubric of 
&#8220;anarchism&#8221;.<a href="#n85" name="fn85" target="_self">[85]</a> If by &#8220;anarchism&#8221; one means the rejection of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat and all that implies, then the KAPD was no more &#8220;anarchist&#8221; 
than Bordiga, about whom Lenin said at the Third Congress: &#8220;He has most loyally 
declared ... that he has renounced all anarchism and all 
anti-parliamentarism.&#8221;<a href="#n86" name="fn86" target="_self">[86]</a> The Italian Left would later be known not for its 
orthodoxy (compared to the German Left, with its occasional syndicalist and 
federalist <i>appearances</i>) but for its doctrinal adherence to and faith in 
the Communist International. Bordiga&#8217;s position is somewhat reminiscent of that 
of Roland-Holst (cf. above). The Communist International was still a potentially 
communist force, it had to be preserved.</p>

<p class="fst">The Italian Left was moving in the direction of collaboration 
with the German Left in 1917-1921, but the question was never really posed 
because the proletariat did not transcend the national framework. The position 
which maintains that the Italian Left was not part of the communist left, or 
that other position which holds that it was the only communist left, are both 
founded upon a false criterion: the Leninist/non-Leninist opposition. As a 
&#8220;Leninist&#8221;, Bordiga would be totally distinct from the German Left. It is the 
very idea of this &#8220;Leninism&#8221; as a reference point for the history of the 
revolutionary movement of that epoch, which must again be challenged. One cannot 
study history from the vantage point of a time after the period in question. It 
was only after 1923<a href="#n87" name="fn87" target="_self">[87]</a> that &#8220;Leninism&#8221; became an ideological reference point. 
In the sense in which the term is ordinarily used, Leninism has never existed. 
It is an invention and a distortion of reality. &#8220;Leninism&#8221; and &#8220;Trotskyism&#8221; are 
products of the defeat, not its cause or its remedy. It is absurd to use 
Bolshevism as an object lesson as Rühle did in 1939, especially when Stalin was 
at that time liquidating all that remained of it.<a href="#n88" name="fn88" target="_self">[88]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It would be vain to develop this or that partial aspect by 
considering it as the whole. Thus, in 1917-1921, no one had a global vision, and 
various degrees of confusion reigned everywhere. The &#8220;German Left&#8221; is itself a 
convenient formula which conceals quite different realities. Rühle was much more 
lucid about the real policy of the Communist International and the need to break 
with it, but succumbed to certain federalist and educationalist illusions. 
Gorter had too much faith in the Communist International and deluded himself 
about the possibility of building a leftist current within it, but had a better 
understanding of the need to unify the movement and to strengthen its 
organization. He was mistaken about March 1921, which Rühle assessed more 
correctly. Bordiga overestimated the prospects offered by the Communist 
International, without seeing that the failure of the world revolutionary 
movement would bring in its wake a <i>regression</i> on the part of the Russians 
and an initially ambiguous policy which would become reactionary later. We have 
shown how both the KAPD of 1920 and the Italian Communist Party insisted on <i>
discipline</i>, the need for an organizing framework to prepare for the 
movement&#8217;s reactivation.<a href="#n89" name="fn89" target="_self">[89]</a> Their shared organizational fetishism was not 
catastrophic, however, since all activity brings deviation with it (by 
transforming a means to an end), which is often corrected by the unfolding of 
the action itself (but not always).</p>

<p class="fst">The Left (German and Italian) confronted the same problems in 
different countries, and tried to respond to these problems. In Italy, Bordiga 
made concessions at the Bologna Congress (October 1919) and at Livorno (January 
1921).<a href="#n90" name="fn90" target="_self">[90]</a> Damen (who broke with the &#8220;Bordigist&#8221; ICP during the early 1950s) 
would write that the abstentionist fraction should have brought about the schism 
sooner: in 1919 rather than in 1921.<a href="#n91" name="fn91" target="_self">[91]</a> The left was diverted from the theme of 
its international convergence at the Second World Congress in 1920. Rühle had 
contributed to this, by refusing to represent the KAPD at the Congress, but it 
was primarily due to the Bolsheviks who arranged everything in order to prevent 
the various lefts from approaching one another. &#8220;The need to seriously consider 
international relations never arose, however, for the German Left. Perhaps this 
was the clearest indication of its insignificance.&#8221;<a href="#n92" name="fn92" target="_self">[92]</a> Considered as a whole, 
the course of the revolutionary movement did not depend on the Left, but on the 
extent and depth of the social crisis, including the greater or lesser capacity 
of the proletarians to organize themselves with a view to destroying capitalist 
society.</p>

International press from its beginnings, and the Communist International&#8217;s

which he defines as &#8220;the Marxism of the age of imperialism&#8221;. The Italian Left 
rejected this definition, and understood that Lenin did not represent an 
instance of &#8220;progress&#8221; in relation to Marx, but did not correctly situate Lenin. 
Lenin both went <i>beyond and fell short of</i> Marx at the same time. Cf.
