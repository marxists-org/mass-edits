<h3><a name="h1">The Bourgeoisie and the &#8220;Workers Party&#8221;</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The economic crisis at the end of 1918 and the beginning of 1919 
was primarily due to economic disorganization caused by the war and the need for 
peacetime reconversion: at this level alone, it was not a <i>crisis</i> in the 
sense of a cyclical crisis. Its features (a considerable decrease in production, 
a large trade deficit, a million unemployed at the beginning of 1919&#8212;with 
250,000 unemployed in Berlin alone&#8212;a 2/3 decline in the exchange value of the 
mark) were conjunctural effects of the war and reconversion. Germany would later 
regain its competitive position. But the prohibition of strikes and the scarcity 
of the necessities for survival placed the workers in a very difficult position 
which, in addition to all kinds of sacrifices during the war, generated a 
permanent readiness for violent action and insurrection in an important fraction 
of the proletariat which would last until March of 1921, even when reformism had 
become generally dominant. For this revolutionary movement, the democratic 
revolution of November was just one moment within the process of social 
revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The way capitalism managed to survive and to crush subversion was 
basically new. All the institutions which one would have thought would have 
served the counterrevolution had collapsed. First of all, the State and the 
Army; the bourgeoisie remained in the background, its parties having 
relinquished political power (see the previous Chapter). The bourgeoisie yielded 
to the socialists, whose leader, Ebert, reassured them: &#8220;We are the only ones 
who can maintain order.&#8221; Among the pre-revolutionary hierarchies, the SPD and 
the ADGB were the only institutions which were still effective on a national 
scale in Germany. They had a great deal of influence over the reformist majority 
of the workers. In most cases, workers&#8217; initiatives designated SPD members as 
their representatives in negotiations, even in particularly radical regions like 
the Ruhr and Berlin.</p>

<p class="fst">Nowhere did the proletariat undertake decisive measures of the 
kind advocated by Lenin in his <i>Message to the Soviet Republic of Bavaria</i> 
of April 27, 1919. It is against this backdrop that one must evaluate the extent 
of the movement and the vicissitudes of the left. Except for Bremen and Dresden 
(bastions of the left radicals within the future KAPD), the SPD would continue 
to control the majorities in the councils of almost all the large cities.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> The 
proletarians did not create <i>their own</i> military organization and only part 
of the proletariat&#8212;with the exception of Hamburg, Kiel and Dresden&#8212;took up arms. 
In the Alsace the movement was suffocated under the weight of nationalism, due 
to the struggle for influence between Francophiles and Germanophiles.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> In 
Bremen the council dismissed nationalist professors and reactionary 
functionaries, and organized a red guard. In Brunswick a red guard was formed 
and the judiciary was purged. In most cases, this amounted to the destruction of 
only &#8220;half&#8221; of the State: but one does not get rid of the State with halfway 
measures. In Hamburg the Soldiers Council was in the hands of the popular 
militia (<i>Volkswehr</i>) formed in November 1918 from the <i>Reichswehr</i> 
Ninth Army Corps, without anyone knowing just who was in command. Laufenberg 
proposed, on November 12, that the traditional political institutions be 
dissolved.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> But the Council came up against economic and social problems which 
it could not solve in the bourgeois manner (due to a lack of money), and which 
it did not try to solve in a communist way. Attempting to discover a third way, 
it prepared its own downfall. On the 16<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, a delegation of 
capitalists offered financial assistance on the condition that it would have the 
right to control the use of the funds. The Council then provisionally reinstated 
the traditional institutions so as not to frighten the American bourgeoisie who 
were about to grant a loan to Germany. A &#8220;Consultative Economic Council&#8221; 
composed of industrialists took charge of financial affairs. On the 18<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, 
with municipal elections having been announced for April 1, 1919, and the 
political form not having received a revolutionary content, it was logical that 
it would immediately be jeopardized as such. The councils &#8220;committed suicide&#8221; 
after December 1918, upon accepting the convocation of a constituent assembly, 
and the classic local institutions elected by universal suffrage. The workers 
ruled entire cities, but accomplished nothing.</p>

<p class="fst">In Bavaria, the transformations in the army were purely formal: 
certain rights were conceded to the soldiers in exchange for their general 
obedience to their officers.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> Even worse, the only effect of this reform was 
to exacerbate the officers&#8217; hatred for all social change, without having 
granted, in exchange, the means for the soldiers to organize themselves against 
the officer corps. J. Knief considered &#8220;the practice of many of the soldiers 
councils to be counterrevolutionary&#8221;.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> It was within the proletariat itself 
that the issue would be decided. The majority of the workers, organized in trade 
unions and led by the SPD, would be the agent for capital&#8217;s survival. <i>Capital 
only exists because the proletariat creates it, and the proletariat reproduces 
capital until the general breakdown of the relations integral to capital, 
together with the experience of numerous failed revolutions, compels the 
proletariat to struggle and gives it the ability to fight for its survival by 
rejecting its own condition as proletariat, rather than in order to survive, by 
way of political reforms and activities, as workers who sell their labor power.</i></p>

<p class="fst">After taking power, the SPD declared the revolution was over, at 
least in its phase of violence and mass action. The party of the working class 
being in power, and the working class thus having taken political power in its 
hands, the revolutionary transformation of social relations (what was called 
socialization) was only a question of time: it was a matter of a progressive and 
peaceful process. The development of capital still had to continue, since only a 
capital which had arrived at the ultimate stage of its development could be 
&#8220;socialized&#8221;. For this reason, order must reign, and the &#8220;Spartacists&#8221; must be 
crushed, &#8220;Spartacists&#8221; being another way of saying &#8220;reactionary 
lumpenproletariat&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">The workers movement came to consider the revolutionary 
proletarians as marginal in respect to the &#8220;working class&#8221;. This was also the 
source of the rise of racism: anti-Semitism wreaked havoc in the workers 
movement,<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> especially the variety directed against the eastern Jews who had 
come from Russia and Poland to find work or to escape from pogroms.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Jews of the east are, for the most part, a proletarian group 
mired in filth, poverty, and the lowest moral level of commerce. Unable to adapt 
to industry, their physical constitution, furthermore, generally renders them 
ill-suited for industrial or agricultural labor.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Considering fact that these lines were extracted from the SPD&#8217;s 
leading journal, <i>Neue Zeit</i>, one can imagine what forms anti-Semitism 
assumed in everyday agitation and propaganda. Becker, an SPD deputy in the 
national assembly, declared in that forum, in 1919: &#8220;The Warschovskys, the 
Auerbachs and the Sickmanns of Lodz, the Stachovskys and the Alexandrovitchs of 
Warsaw are doing business everywhere in Breslau and Berlin. They cross the 
frontiers with false or expired passports. They lounge about, with their 
characteristic arrogance, in the first class compartments of our express 
trains... This gang, it truly does not deserve to continue to live on this 
earth, we must ... eliminate these parasites from our world.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Having a better appreciation than anyone else for the 
revolutionary potential of the radical sector, the driving force of the movement 
which had just been unleashed, the SPD took measures to confront it, while it 
diverted the &#8220;masses&#8221; with grand speeches about the advent of socialization. One 
can see the ideology of socialization in P. Lensch, who moved from the left to 
the socialist right wing and who announced on the eve of the peace that capital 
would emerge from the conflict as &#8220;a captive of socialism&#8221;.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> Economic 
socialization was inevitable: &#8220;capitalism must be organized&#8221;. Prefiguring the 
Nazis, which is to say the language of <i>National Socialism</i> so dear to the 
SPD, he presented the alternative between &#8220;social&#8221; organization&#8221; and 
&#8220;plutocratic&#8221; organization. The State &#8220;has undergone a process of socialization&#8221; 
and social democracy has experienced a process of &#8220;nationalization&#8221;: &#8220;For the 
first time in history, we are establishing harmony between the State and the 
people.&#8221; Nazism would receive its &#8220;totalitarian language&#8221; from social democracy.</p>

<p class="fst">In an article on <i>Socialization</i>,<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> Pannekoek criticized 
the term itself, which alone designates nothing but organized capitalism or 
&#8220;State socialism&#8221;. But he did not discuss the notion of a community without 
exchange. Nor would Gorter:<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The proletariat must take State and legislative power into its 
hands. It must guarantee a minimum of the means of subsistence to all the 
workers and to all those who must become workers. It must take over the 
management of all production, of trade and transportation, and of the 
distribution of production. It must decree compulsory labor for all. It must 
repudiate the State&#8217;s debts; confiscate war profits; it must only tax capital 
and income and thereby arrive at a confiscation of capital. It must expropriate 
the Banks and large industry. It must socialize the land.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The SPD also availed itself of violent measures. After November 
10, Ebert was in contact with the Army&#8217;s leaders and assured them of his 
assistance: the distrust, and even more than distrust, on the part of the 
General Staff with respect to social democracy was a habit which would not 
disappear simply because the latter held government power. It was at this moment 
that Ebert uttered his famous phrase: &#8220;we are the only party which can maintain 
order.&#8221;<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> On the 11<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, Ebert&#8217;s government made haste to sign the 
armistice so as to be able to dedicate itself to a more essential war. Since the 
Army had to be dismantled according to the terms of the armistice, its leaders 
undertook the construction of <i>Freikorps</i>: even so, the military means at 
the disposal of the counterrevolution were still scarce, which was a powerful 
reason for choosing which tactic to follow. The SPD faced a unique situation, 
unlike, for example, that faced by its Austrian counterparts.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> Founded in 
1889 by an accord between radical and moderate socialists, Austrian social 
democracy did not have to vote for war credits, since the government had 
suspended parliament in March of 1914. It did, however, support the State (above 
all K. Renner and V. Adler, against the opposition of F. Adler). Austrian social 
democracy did not have as much blood on its hands as its German neighbor, and 
preserved, for the most part, a leftist ideology and semblance. &#8220;Socialization&#8221; 
and democracy had relatively greater importance in Austria than in Germany from 
the point of view of direct repression.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">The Function of Democracy</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Democracy served all purposes. Trade union leaders and employers, 
who had long served on the same commissions, quickly signed the accord known 
under the name of the <i>Arbeitsgemeinschaft</i>: literally, the &#8220;community of 
labor&#8221;. The businessman, who was aware that the period rendered a great number 
of measures impractical, surrendered &#8220;everything&#8221; to preserve what was 
essential.</p>

<p class="fst">For the trade unions and the SPD this reaction was excellent 
propaganda for guaranteeing a good beginning for socialization and for 
preventing strikes. Significant reforms, for that era, were adopted, such as the <i>
principle</i> of the eight hour day. In particular, the trade unions were 
recognized as valid interlocutors and components within the enterprise. Joint 
committees were made obligatory, composed of trade union and employer 
representatives in enterprises with more than 20 employees: this measure would 
be implemented in January 1920 under the rubric of the &#8220;law on enterprise 
councils&#8221;. Instead of going on strike and conducting propaganda campaigns, it 
was better to discuss matters with the joint committee: this is what the 
anti-trade union left would call &#8220;economic democracy&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">Council democracy revived parliamentary democracy, the trade 
unions being unable to overcome the simulacrum of parliamentary democracy within 
their own ranks. In December, the elections for the provincial assemblies were 
organized: the SPD won a majority, except in Saxony where the USPD emerged 
victorious. Part of the revolutionary movement&#8217;s energy was distracted, and the 
consciousness which it had built with its own efforts faded. The SPD declared 
its support for the election of a constituent assembly to determine the form 
which the future republican and democratic Germany would assume. But the SPD&#8217;s 
power was the product of a movement which had taken the form of councils and not 
of a parliament. In conformity with the ceaselessly repeated statement that the 
councils exercised all power and that the peoples commissars were only their 
delegates, it must have been expected that the pan-German Council Congress would 
itself decide to convoke, by means of elections in which all classes would 
participate, a constituent assembly into whose hands it would deliver its power. 
This is what the Congress which took place in Berlin between December 16 and 20 
decided: from then on, the essential outlines of the decisive confrontation were 
fixed. Immediately afterwards, the attack on the <i>Volksmarinedivision</i> took 
place.</p>

<p class="fst">In order to prevent the revolutionary wave from sweeping 
everything away, the counterrevolution consolidated the only really existing 
means to stop it: the reformist majority of the working class, which in addition 
had its own concrete goals&#8212;negotiations with the employers, councils, 
elections. Everything was connected together by democratic ideology, and 
defended by the <i>Freikorps</i>. It was on this last level that the shoe 
pinched: the military apparatus of the counterrevolution was short on soldiers, 
while the workers were armed. The first direct attack on the radicals (the <i>
Volksmarinedivision</i>) would fail (see the next Chapter). This would give way 
to the tactic of progressively crushing the partial uprisings in the various 
regions of Germany, since the counterrevolutionary assault could not be 
simultaneously concentrated in more than one region at a time. There were two 
successive counterrevolutionary waves, in January-February and March-April 1919, 
each of which began in Berlin. This relative weakness of the State also explains 
why Bavaria could enjoy &#8220;self-determination&#8221; until May.</p>

<p class="fst">This tactic could not have succeeded unless the revolution, 
despite its scale, was unable to act simultaneously and with one will. Each 
council power had specific problems of all kinds which it hoped to solve 
locally. There is no example of a movement which was victorious in one State and 
devoted itself to agitation in a neighboring State. Among the leftists, it seems 
that Wolffheim and Laufenberg were the only ones to concern themselves with 
establishing communication between the rebellious zones in northern and central 
Germany, and to have assumed the perspective of action on a national scale. 
Laufenberg&#8217;s <i>Revolution in Hamburg</i> is quite revealing in its depiction of 
the important and contradictory features of the German revolution; the 
democratic revolution was not merely an empty phrase. It was, above all, the 
reaction which was conscious of Germany as a unified State.</p>

<p class="fst">Once it had consolidated the counterweight to halt the 
revolution, social democracy had to take immediate action in order to prevent 
the constitution of the proletarians into a class, a process begun at the end of 
the war, whose first confused manifestation was the generalization of 
councils-soviets, but which would acquire an increasingly more precise 
expression in the factory councils and the increasing strength of the 
Spartacists and the IKD, particularly with the fusion of these two groups into 
the KPD.</p>

<p class="fst">To speak of &#8220;strategy&#8221;, of &#8220;tactics&#8221;, of &#8220;provocation&#8221;, etc., by 
no means implies that the motive force of this whole revolutionary movement was 
established by &#8220;consciousness&#8221;. Under the pressure of the social and political 
crisis which followed the war, social and political groups were obliged to take 
action in order to survive; the survival of one could only be achieved to the 
detriment of the other, and each group adopted, more or less consciously, the 
tactic which the pre-existing conditions imposed. The SPD was forced to take 
action against the <i>Volksmarinedivision</i>, and after its defeat it was 
compelled to sacrifice a pawn against the revolution (the expulsion of 
Eichhorn). In both cases, these moves provoked a reaction in the reactionary 
camp for whom it became obvious that the proletarians, having reached the limit 
of their potential, could not bring about the fall of the social democratic 
State. The reaction could then make its move without fearing any response.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Except for the Ruhr insurrection (1920) and the &#8220;March Action&#8221; 
(1921), all the ensuing proletarian assaults would follow a relatively 
unchanging pattern. Born as defense against an attack by the power of capital, 
they went on the offensive and took power in a region or a city in Germany. The 
offensive was exhausted at that level and negotiations then took place, led by 
the USPD, the right wing tendency in the KPD and, in the beginning, even by the 
local leaders of the SPD, with the remnants of the local authorities or with the 
central power. The latter conceded everything, since they were not themselves 
put into question. Afterwards, the revolutionary wave receded and an implacable 
repression could begin.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">The Founding of the KPD</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The prelude to the founding of the KPD was the national 
conference of the IKD held on December 24 in Berlin, attended by delegates from 
northern Germany, Saxony, Bavaria and the Rhineland.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> A debate was held to 
determine whether they should form their own party or unite with Spartacus. The 
IKD warned the Spartacus League that in any event the Communist Party would be 
formed in Germany &#8220;with or without it&#8221;.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> Radek had just returned to Germany 
after having played a prominent role in the Commissariat of Foreign Affairs in 
Moscow, and convinced them to unite with Spartacus: they demanded, however, that 
the Spartacus League leave the USPD. On the question of parliamentary action, 
they were divided into two positions, one in favor of it, one against it. It was 
decided not to make a declaration concerning the issue until each delegate had 
consulted his constituents: when the meeting resumed on the 30<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, 
only one delegate still defended participation in parliament.</p>

<p class="fst">After having desired to remain in the USPD, the Spartacus League 
placed itself &#8220;outside the organization&#8221; by taking the initiative to hold a 
national conference in October (see the preceding Chapter). Excluded <i>de facto</i>, 
it accepted the IKD&#8217;s position and left the USPD. A small minority (Luxemburg, 
Levi, and L. Jogisches) was very hesitant, since it judged that the situation 
was not &#8220;mature&#8221; enough for the creation of the revolutionary party. But they 
followed the majority. The Congress set the date when Spartacus would convoke 
its second national conference: December 30.</p>

<p class="fst">Except for certain specialized histories,<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> whenever the 
matter of the radical movement of 1918-19 is discussed, it is the Spartacists 
who get the most attention. The left groups of Bremen, Dresden, etc., are 
generally treated as marginal organizations. History (among others, the official 
histories of the communist parties) uncritically appropriates the point of view 
of the public opinion of the era, which considered the entire radical movement 
to be an effect of a Spartacist conspiracy. The same phenomenon is reproduced 
with respect to every revolutionary movement: if there is something which public 
opinion (= bourgeois ideology for the general public), and along with it the 
various ideologies derived from Leninism, cannot admit, it is that the 
revolutionary masses are the authors of their own movement, that they are their 
own leaders, and that only in those conditions are they authentically 
revolutionary. In its obstinate search for culprits and &#8220;ringleaders&#8221;, the 
bourgeois campaign after the Commune had already fabricated the image of the IWA 
as the executive committee of gifted leaders who were active everywhere. This 
idea later penetrated the revolutionary ranks and contaminated the Marx-Bakunin 
debate. At a moment of revolutionary retrocession, the bourgeoisie imposed its 
own representation of the subversive movement itself. So it would proceed in 
relation to the events after 1917, particularly with Lenin and the Communist 
International (cf. the Introduction above).</p>

<p class="fst">At the founding Congress of the KPD it became evident that the 
overwhelming majority of the delegates, although not all of them members of the 
IKD, adhered to the theses of the IKD. The party would have 90,000 members in 
March 1919. According to F. Kool, it was formed of mostly young workers &#8220;without 
political experience&#8221;. According to Bock, the sociological profile of its 
recruits was much more varied and included workers from all layers of the 
proletariat. Subsequently, a consensus concerning the &#8220;lack of maturity&#8221; of the 
delegates to the founding Congress would become established.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> Historians and 
political organizations cannot admit that proletarians could &#8220;spontaneously&#8221; 
adopt such radical positions.</p>

<p class="fst">After having unanimously adopted the program which had been 
written by Luxemburg and had already been published on December 14 as the 
&#8220;Program of the Spartacus League&#8221; under the title of <i>What Does Spartacus 
Want?</i>, along with the slogans of the &#8220;Communist Party of Germany (Spartacus 
League)&#8221; or KPD(S), the leftist tendency crystallized around two questions, that 
of participation in the elections (for the constituent assembly) and that of 
working in the trade unions.</p>

<p class="fst">The Congress held a debate on the question of organization, but 
for the most part opposed centralism. Workers autonomy, if not workerism, 
occupied a preferential place in the Congress. Eberlein declared:<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> &#8220;The 
organizations of the old SPD, except for periodic elections, were inert and 
empty... We must construct our organization on totally different foundations. We 
demand that the workers and soldiers councils exercise all political power. The 
factory councils are the basis of power. Our organization must be adapted to 
this situation. It would then be best, probably, to create communist groups in 
the factories. It cannot be tolerated that orders should be imposed from above. 
The industrial organizations must enjoy complete autonomy. The task of the 
central organ is above all that of synthesizing the movements which develop 
outside of it and assuring political and ideological leadership.&#8221; Each 
organization must have full autonomy of action; the central office has a minimal 
political role: information clearing house, preparation of congresses and 
managing day-to-day business. Above all it was not to be a revolutionary general 
staff for all of Germany. The representatives of the party&#8217;s minority faction 
were elected to leadership positions: Luxemburg, Liebknecht, Jogisches, Levi. 
The only &#8220;leftist&#8221; among the party&#8217;s leaders, Frölich, was dispatched to 
Bavaria. The KPD would not adopt Bolshevik centralism as a &#8220;principle&#8221; of 
organization until its third Congress (October 1920), after having excluded the 
left, which would denounce the centralism-federalism alternative as false and 
argue that it had been superseded by the &#8220;<i>union</i>&#8221; (cf. the texts of the 
KAPD and the AAU):<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> this was the beginning of the critique of organizational 
fetishism.</p>

<p class="fst">Participation in the elections was rejected by 62 votes against 
23; among the latter, Liebknecht declared that he had only reluctantly voted &#8220;in 
favor&#8221;.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> Knief, on the other hand, of the Bremen IKD, was a supporter of 
revolutionary parliamentarism. The 62 votes represented the IKD and the party&#8217;s 
&#8220;rank and file&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">Luxemburg reproached the abstentionists for &#8220;transforming 
radicalism (which in German is synonymous with &#8216;leftism&#8217;) into something quite 
comfortable&#8221;. A more &#8220;useful&#8221; tactic was needed, Levi explained in his report, 
which would consist in participating in the elections in order to destroy 
parliamentarism. Rühle presented the opposition&#8217;s report. The majority of those 
&#8220;lacking in political experience&#8221; did not want to hear any nonsense about 
classical politics, and their hostile shouts often interrupted the speeches of 
Luxemburg and Levi.</p>

<p class="fst">It was crucial for its current and future activities that the KPD 
Congress should affirm that the party should work for the destruction of the 
trade unions and call upon all of its members to leave them: such was the 
opinion of the abstentionist majority. On behalf of the left, Frölich (Bremen) 
expounded the obligation to end the old separation between political 
organization (party) and economic organization (trade union): the theme of 
unitary organization already broached in 1917 in <i>Arbeiterpolitik</i> and 
which would be championed by Rühle and the AAU-E. Luxemburg and the rest of the 
party minority did not directly address this issue: it was only after the 
revolution that the trade unions, they said, could be replaced in their economic 
role by the councils. Luxemburg managed to have this question tabled and 
referred to a committee and consequently it was not the subject of a party 
resolution. Opposition to the trade unions was by no means assured, since it was 
largely based on a preference for the councils, and it was already known that 
the latter were, in their great majority, reformist.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The radicalism displayed by the Congress was one reason why the <i>
RO</i> refused to join the KPD. Under Däumig&#8217;s leadership, they formed a 
&#8220;Community of Labor&#8221; and in 1922 returned to the rump USPD (that is, what was 
left of it after the departure, in 1920, of its left wing for the KPD; cf. 
Chapter 13), which soon rejoined the SPD. A minority chose to remain outside of 
the SPD and the KPD and preserved the name USPD, which later split in its turn 
into two groups in 1923, which would join the SAP (another centrist party) in 
1931. The ex-USPD members who returned to the SPD in 1922 preserved certain 
characteristically &#8220;leftist&#8221; positions: hostile to national coalitions of the 
socialist party with the bourgeois parties, in 1923 they initiated the abortive 
experience of the &#8220;workers government&#8221; in Saxony.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Luxemburg&#8217;s maneuver regarding the trade union question and the 
fact that the party minority was elected to the party&#8217;s leadership positions 
demonstrated a certain inexperience or incompetence in political affairs on the 
part of the KPD majority: this would be further confirmed when, in October 1919, 
the minority managed to exclude the majority. The German Left would be 
constituted and would distinguish itself in opposition to Spartacism, in the 
course of which it would experience more difficulties than in other aspects of 
its break with its social democratic past.<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> But if there is a clear 
difference between &#8220;Spartacism&#8221; and the &#8220;German Left&#8221;, neither the one nor the 
other had become petrified in 1919. Had proletarian action followed an ascending 
course, which did not happen, profound analyses would have been possible. It is 
just as impossible to draw a hard and fast line between the two currents, as the 
golden legend of Spartacism is false. The KPD Congress was divided over &#8220;the 
question of the &#8216;unitary&#8217; organization defended by ISD elements ... and the 
&#8216;leader-masses&#8217; problem, which in addition to garnering the support of the above 
mentioned &#8216;radicals&#8217; also had sympathizers among the Spartacists, who had 
defended these positions&#8212;although in a somewhat vague manner&#8212;when they had 
constituted the &#8216;International&#8217; fraction of the USPD&#8221;.<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> It would be the left, 
however, which would be consolidated during the course of the struggles of 1919, 
and its divergences with the KPD&#8217;s right wing would become so profound that they 
would lead to a split.</p>

<p class="fst">The Spartacist leaders proved to be incapable of breaking with 
social democracy and its methods. One of the errors of the left was that of not 
criticizing the party program itself. According to <i>What Does Spartacus Want?</i>, 
a revolution had taken place: its first phase (up to December 24) had been 
&#8220;exclusively political&#8221;; from that point forward, it had to be oriented towards 
what was essential: towards the field of the economy.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The conquest of power cannot be accomplished at one blow, but 
must be incremental: we shall introduce ourselves into the bourgeois State until 
we occupy all of its posts and defend them against all external attacks... It is 
a step-by-step, hand-to-hand struggle, in each State, in each city, in each 
village, in order to put all the instruments of power into the hands of the 
workers and soldiers councils, instruments which must slowly be torn from the 
grasp of the bourgeoisie. While achieving this goal we must, first of all, 
educate our comrades...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">It serves no purpose to insist on those aspects which separate 
Marx (concerning which Pannekoek and, later, Lenin, would write at length) from 
this &#8220;incremental&#8221; conquest of the capitalist State by a proletariat which 
&#8220;introduces itself&#8221; into that State. It is the same kind of absence of a rupture 
as is found in the Kautskyism of <i>The Road to Power</i>. Luxemburg&#8217;s 
contradiction, like that of so many others, was that of effectively being a 
revolutionary, and not only in words, but without acquiring the means to really 
be a revolutionary. Her originality resides in the method chosen for her 
purpose: it is always a question of teaching and educating, but by means of 
action and not classical pedagogy. The fear of a failed putsch caused Luxemburg 
to renounce proposing a centralized struggle: &#8220;It is among the rank and file, 
where each factory owner confronts his wage slaves, where we must uproot the 
instruments of power, little by little, from the rulers.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Luxemburg did not understand that even though the class struggle 
is especially fluid and mobile, it also crystallizes into organizations, both 
revolutionary and reactionary.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> Hence her refusal to create an independent 
organization. Her reasoning in relation to the State born in November 1918 was 
like her reasoning concerning the SPD and the USPD. Conceiving of social life 
primarily as movement, she neglected the moments of rupture. She rejected a 
frontal assault on the November State (as she had previously rejected an attack 
on the SPD) because the workers occupied a considerable position within it and 
could influence its further development. Of course, if there is no rupture, a 
destruction of the institutional forms which originated in the old phase of 
stability, the movement would still be a movement <i>internal</i> to capitalism, 
and would even help capitalism to adapt to the new conditions. Capitalism only 
assumes the appearances of the revolution in order to modernize itself: as Marx 
said about the democrats, they recruit the revolution to their side. A few weeks 
later, the same kind of reasoning would lead Luxemburg to suicide due to her 
desire to &#8220;stand with&#8221; the masses, to be present within the proletarian <i>
movement</i>. The same attitude of wanting to stay close to the masses caused 
her to remain in the SPD, and later, to remain in the USPD, and then even later 
to opt for the insurrectionary adventure.</p>
