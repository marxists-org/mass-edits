<p class="fst">A historian of ideas, tying up loose ends and going over the 
themes of his research, could establish a series of correspondences between the 
German and Italian Lefts, Luxemburgism and the German Left, the Italian Left and 
Leninism, and Leninism and the German Left. This complexity testifies to the 
fact that there can be no theoretical synthesis without a practical synthesis 
through proletarian action. The German Left was influenced by the SPD left, the 
SDKPL and Bolshevism (united in the personality of Radek prior to 1914), the 
IWW, the wartime mass workers organizations, and revolutionary syndicalism. Only 
by virtue of being linked to an active movement could theory reform itself by 
avoiding the double pitfalls of eclecticism and sectarianism. The least that can 
be done now is to examine problems on the basis of their real contradictions, 
and not of their secondary effects. In conditions which were characterized by 
both class struggle as well as revolutionary weakness, as in 1917-1921, one 
cannot speak of a &#8220;correct&#8221; line unfortunately defended by a small minority, 
whose more generalized application would have prevented the disaster which 
befell it. Conversely, even within currents which were as much the prisoners of 
the old movement as was Spartacism, there were tendencies toward clarification.</p>

<p class="fst">The communist left was not the brain of a movement, but the 
highest expression of its contradictions and, not manifesting a comprehensive 
vision, was itself contradictory. It was much more the product of a situation 
which was a revolutionary dead end, than the most advanced element of a 
generally revolutionary movement which was defeated. In reality, only a fraction 
of the proletarians had entered the fray. What J. Andrieu had feared after the 
Commune had come to pass:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The proletariat has always been beaten because it has drawn back 
in fear from silent challenges. It has given the impression that it would 
attack... Later it has fought without order or preparation. These are the facts! 
Neither time nor means allow us to be defeated again... The struggle for power 
is nothing but a pretext for the next day&#8217;s throat-cutting.&#8221;<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The new movements will not be like 1919 writ large. It is 
criminal to idealize this period, from which the movement must above all retain 
the clearest example of categorical and democratic evisceration, on a 
continental scale, in the history of the proletariat. It is not in order to 
reject the past in its totality that revolutionaries point out some of the 
defeats of the proletariat (which are also <i>their own defeats, since they form 
an integral part of the proletariat</i>), but in order, by every possible means, 
to avoid them in the future. To conceive of the extent of the counterrevolution 
is not to pass from one extreme to another, and to completely transform the 
classic leftist outlook in order to suddenly discover that ... nothing at all 
had taken place. Interpreting the period as a simple adaptation on the part of 
capital to its problems would mean abandoning one naïve stance for another. This 
point of view is as &#8220;undialectical&#8221; as the concept of the &#8220;heroic period&#8221; of the 
&#8220;first four congresses&#8221; of the Communist International. Nothing justifies the 
assertion that the German proletariat was condemned in advance. The <i>a 
posteriori</i> judgment which attributes its defeat to &#8220;objective conditions&#8221; 
forgets to situate itself and to re-situate action in relation to those 
conditions: revolutionary action does not <i>create</i> these conditions, but <i>
modifies</i> them. Absolute determinism is nothing but an inverted voluntarism, 
which explains everything by the absence of the &#8220;party&#8221;.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The outcome is not always the same victory frustrated, one must 
not always attribute it to the same causes, and it is always difficult to affirm 
that a different line of conduct on the part of the revolutionaries would have 
altered the result.&#8221;<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In considering the confrontation between the German Left and the 
rest of the revolutionary movement, or what is taken to be such a confrontation, 
it would be tempting to quote Engels&#8217; commentary on the Gotha Congress:<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> &#8220;On 
the theoretical level we are a hundred times superior to the Lassallians, but we 
are far from being their equals in political skill.&#8221; Once again, &#8220;honest folk&#8221; 
have been cheated by slick politicians. To leave it at that, however, would 
amount to making this a political history. The class struggle in Russia assumed 
more acute and violent, but less profound forms: hence the <i>contradictory</i> 
re-activation of communist theory in its social democratic version by the 
Russians. Although more effective, the Russian theory is at the same time 
ill-adapted for European revolutionary problems. With regression (which the 
Bolsheviks did not themselves cause, although they did contribute to it), this 
lack of adaptability became an adaptation to the counterrevolution (return to 
trade unionism, mass parties, parliamentarism, nationalism in the name of the 
&#8220;right to self-determination&#8221;). The texts and the deeds of the Communist 
International translated an over-optimistic assessment of the situation<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> 
linked to the will to advance matters by gathering together large numbers of 
people. The formation of the Italian Communist Party offers the clearest example 
of incoherence: the Communist International&#8217;s emissaries were in favor of a 
split by the left, which the Executive would always deplore. Even assuming that 
the Communist International had at any time effectively directed its sections, 
something which remains to be proven, it was only able to do so after the 
revolutionary reflux. Centralization, advocated by the Russians and the Italian 
Communist Party, among others, would not be employed until it had lost its 
usefulness in playing any kind of subversive role.</p>

<p class="fst">Both Lenin&#8217;s <i>Infantile Disorder</i> and Gorter&#8217;s <i>Open 
Letter to Comrade Lenin</i> are equally incapable of defining a strategy for 
victory. The former submerges the proletariat into the old ruts. The latter does 
not indicate the revolution&#8217;s means of social transformation: by the time it was 
written, the forms of organization which it advocated were without content and 
were collapsing. After having witnessed the difficulties encountered in the 
transition from one world to another in the revolutionary movements of that era, 
Mattick concluded: &#8220;The lesson learned was how not to proceed.&#8221;<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> Paraphrasing 
Lenin on the Commune, we could say about Germany in 1917-1921: it is a movement 
which <i>must not be</i> ours.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> If one compares the insurrection of January 
1919, the red army of the Ruhr and the March Action, the characteristic which 
all three of these uprisings have in common is that they always evolved within a 
social framework which, at bottom, remained the same. The sailors who arrived in 
Berlin from Kiel were roused to revolt by not being paid. The armed 
revolutionaries of Munich got their pay. Hölz <i>distributed trade union funds</i> 
to the unemployed. The Italian workers who occupied the factories in 1920 did 
not put anything essential into question. Prudhommeaux put it this way: military 
struggle and complete transformation of social relations, neither the<i> one</i> 
nor the <i>other</i> are possible unless they are both carried out 
simultaneously.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> For the KAPD: &#8220;The proletarian revolution is an economic 
process and a political process at the same time.&#8221; This assertion could be 
interpreted in a reformist sense (conquest of power in the economy without 
seizing political power).<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> But the thought and activity of the KAPD are proofs 
to the contrary: there is a great difference between organization born of 
reformist demands (in one factory, or anywhere else) without going beyond that 
stage, and <i>territorial</i> organization (such as, for example, the AAU&#8217;s 
&#8220;economic regions&#8221;) which breaks out of the framework of the workplace or the 
terrain of particular reformist demands, in order to confront society as a 
whole, beginning with the State. But it is not enough to <i>invert</i> Gramscist 
and DeLeonist gradualism by advocating the seizure of &#8220;political power&#8221; <i>
before</i> carrying out social transformations. The Communist International only 
distinguished <i>successive</i> stages.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> In its own way, and within a context 
in which the proletariat did not practically go on the offensive against the 
very essence of capital, the German Left had distinguished the revolutionary 
mechanism which was both &#8220;political&#8221; and &#8220;economic&#8221;, military and social. In 
1919, military forces had moved from one region to another in order to crush the 
revolution. Today, capital is much more socialized and ubiquitous, but will 
still have to be dealt with militarily. As Gorter said, revolutionaries cannot 
act without a party,<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> giving this word the meaning of an <i>organization</i> 
of the communist movement. But this organization can only be constructed within 
the process of a complete transformation of capitalist social relations, the 
formation of the human community and the destruction of the world where &#8220;life 
itself appears as a simple means to living&#8221;.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The German Left anticipated certain aspects of the &#8220;modern&#8221; 
revolutionary critique: its analysis of parliamentarism as a spectacle 
(&#8220;theater&#8221;, &#8220;stage&#8221;, etc.), for example. But its defeat can also be measured by 
the fact that it, too, suffered from a gap between its <i>movement</i> and the <i>
organizations</i> which it had provided itself. The 1921 March Action is 
testimony to how the KAPD, too, acted like &#8220;a party in the traditional sense&#8221;, 
exhorting the workers to make the revolution, despite its rank and file&#8217;s &#8220;break 
with the leader/follower tradition&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">It is strange to see how Gorter, in his <i>Last Letter to Lenin</i>, 
denies the divisions on the left. By way of a revolutionary, yet numerically 
small movement, the activity of the German Left was also one of the last mass 
attempts undertaken to &#8220;provide an organization&#8221; to the proletariat, within the 
midst of the bourgeois democratic revolution faced with the problem of creating <i>
representative institutions</i>. But this attempt took place at a time when it 
was no longer possible. In this sense the German Left was undoubtedly the 
expression of the first great proletarian assault, but one which was still 
carried out within an <i>organizational</i> perspective whose debates before and 
after the war (party/class, leaders/masses, centralism/federalism) led to a 
conception which was partly false. The war of 1914, by allowing capital to 
really penetrate all of society, obliged the communist revolution to situate 
itself on the same terrain or be defeated, as in Germany after 1917. After that 
time and outside of any revolutionary period, no permanent workers organization 
independent of capital, or any radical group which is part of the working class 
environment, has existed.</p>

<p class="fst">Afterwards, some people made a total ideological about-face: &#8220;All 
the objective conditions were present. Only one detail was lacking, but this was 
a detail which, in reality, vulgar Marxism had never taken into account: the 
subjective will, self-confidence, the value of moving towards what is new. And 
this detail was everything.&#8221;<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> But this was because the previous struggles had 
not led to a new movement (by integrating the workers struggles into capital) 
and because the disturbances were too feeble to break with that past (the 
democratic political revolution of November 1918).<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The communist left was the expression of the <i>crisis</i> of the 
proletariat. The communist movement was in a state of crisis at every crucial 
moment, because it had left capitalist society behind and was building another 
society at the same time. Some lost hope; others transformed secondary forms 
into fetishes. But the sign of the subversive power of the German Left is 
undoubtedly that it prevents us from falling into revolutionary complacency, the 
idolatry of the proletariat and the anti-materialist belief in the inevitability 
of communism. Because the defeat of the most combative proletarians affects us 
so profoundly, it helps us in our efforts to avoid being defeated next time.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>
