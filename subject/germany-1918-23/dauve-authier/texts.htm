<h2><a name="h1">Foreword</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Any pretense to having collected the &#8220;best&#8221; of the German Left in 
the following section would be vain. One would also have to consider previously 
available texts, above all Bricianer&#8217;s book on Pannekoek and the volume entitled <i>
La Gauche allemande. Textes</i>. [Four of the texts featured in the latter 
volume, <i>The Program of the AAUD, The Guidelines of the AAU-E,</i> extracts 
from <i>The Guidelines of the AAUD</i> and <i>The Leading Principles of the KAI,</i> 
are included below, along with several other recently-translated texts of the 
German Left&#8212;translator&#8217;s note.] All three of these quite dissimilar works, when 
taken together, present a complex picture of the Left. Our selection does not 
place particular emphasis upon &#8220;councilism&#8221; and workers self-organization 
(except for the Wolffheim text), which occupy ample space in Bricianer&#8217;s book. 
Nor does it privilege, as do the documents in <i>La Gauche allemande. Textes</i>, 
the role of the organization (especially that of the KAPD). Fully intending that 
this work should complement the two others mentioned above, we did not want to 
restrict ourselves to just picking out the most important aspects of the Left 
for the revolutionary movement, but also wanted to highlight the Left&#8217;s context 
and the actual extent of its impact on its epoch. Laufenberg&#8217;s text, for 
example, is of great interest insofar as it shows exactly what did and what did 
not take place. Likewise, Gorter provides a quite accurate if somewhat limited 
notion of how most communists experienced and viewed the events of their time. 
His &#8220;Last Letter to Lenin&#8221; also reveals a certain tendency on the part of the 
KAPD, as well, to present itself as a &#8220;party in the traditional sense&#8221;, as the 
March Action demonstrates.</p>

<p class="fst">This book, as well as the Left itself, could be superficially 
criticized for having overemphasized the <i>organizational</i> aspect of the 
revolution. This is true, but what we need to know is precisely why this is so. 
There are no &#8220;subversive social movements&#8221; or &#8220;communist movements&#8221; which are 
not embodied in one or another organizational form. Every content implies a 
form. The weakness of the communist organizational structures in Germany between 
1914 and 1921 was the result of the veritable contradiction of the epoch&#8217;s 
revolutionary movement, which was unleashed by the political and social crisis 
just when capital was undergoing a new, long-lasting phase of expansion (cf. 
Appendix III).</p>

<p class="fst">The critique of organizational formalism is revolutionary to the 
extent that it discovers within this formalism the organization of the absence 
of the revolution and consequently the organization of non-revolutionaries; but 
it does not by any means rule out the necessity of organizing and, if necessary, 
organizing in the most monolithic manner, when facing the tasks of the 
revolution. Otherwise, &#8220;the communist movement&#8221; becomes just as vacuous a 
formula as the intellectuals&#8217; concept of &#8220;the revolution&#8221;. We have not, in any 
case, written a history of the communist movement or of the movement of the 
proletariat in Germany, but have instead studied a practical and theoretical 
current which, although not the only such current, constituted a very rich and 
profound aspect of those movements. The texts collected below present the 
different components which nourished this current, and with it, its weak points.</p>

<p class="fst">For reasons beyond our control having to do with &#8220;intellectual 
property&#8221; rights, we were unable to reproduce Lukàcs&#8217;s <i>Organizational 
Questions of the Third International</i>, originally published in <i>Kommunismus</i> 
(March 15, 1920). We have already discussed (cf. Chapter 17) what distinguished 
this journal, and Lukàcs in particular, from the communist left. The radicalism 
of <i>Kommunismus</i> possessed only a surface resemblance to that of the left. 
For example, the &#8220;active boycott&#8221; advocated by B. Kun, which consisted of taking 
advantage of the occasion of elections in order to carry out as much propaganda 
and to get as much publicity as possible, without running any candidates, leads 
to conferring upon electoral campaigns an importance which they lack and which 
democracy is always trying to impose. It is curious, however, to see Lukàcs 
developing in this article a theory of organization for the Communist Parties, 
and above all of collaboration between them, which reproduces to some degree, on 
an international scale, what the KAPD had in fact realized within its own ranks. 
We have seen how the KAPD insisted on a multiplicity of contacts and initiatives 
on all levels, establishing links directly between its various groups as well as 
in conformance with its formal organizational pyramid.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD was founded upon the necessity for unifying the 
proletariat, in opposition to its division into categories, strata, etc., 
maintained by the trade unions. Like many other revolutionaries in Central 
Europe, Lukàcs was primarily concerned with cutting the umbilical cord to the 
nation. The unity of the Third International, he said, would never be a 
situation finally attained, but is rather a tendency. The Second International 
was based upon an association of separate parties, as they were organized upon 
national foundations, and were only <i>afterwards</i> united on an international 
level for joint action, which was revealed to be impossible, of course, because 
each party had formed itself with reference to the specific problems faced in 
each country: &#8220;The Second International viewed itself as a <i>reality</i>, while 
the Third International views itself as a guiding idea for proletarian actions.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">A serial accumulation of national parties leads to nationalism. 
Internationalism must also be manifested by its own kind of structures.</p>

<p class="fst">The correctness of Lukàcs&#8217;s position is proven in a negative 
sense by the evolution of such parties as the Polish Communist Party (cf. 
Chapter 17). Each Communist Party based its growth as a political (and 
preferably parliamentary) force within the framework of its particular State, 
and thus re-invented nationalism. In the regions where capital was relatively 
weak and was hardly capable of spawning viable nation states, any construction 
of Communist Parties upon the exclusive basis of such States was contrary to 
communism. Lukàcs referred to &#8220;the mining region shared by Poland, 
Czechoslovakia and German Austria, which all depend on this region for their 
coal supplies; the Ruthenian northeast of Hungary was divided between that 
country, Czechoslovakia, Poland and the Ukraine, etc. These issues demand a 
permanent tactical collaboration among the proletarians involved; they can 
neither be abandoned to the isolated actions of the various parties, nor can 
they be made to depend upon the decisions of distant central committees...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">For such regions, Lukàcs proposes a flexible organization which 
groups the communists of the various States who reside in the same region within 
a relatively autonomous structure. Instead of just adding distinct Communist 
Parties together, they mutually interpenetrate one another: &#8220;One and the same 
party must be represented on various central committees.&#8221; Therefore: &#8220;The 
structure of the International ... <i>must never place obstacles in the way of 
the establishment of relations directly between the parties themselves...</i> 
The Second International only admitted national movements grouped within the 
apparent unity of the International: the Third International is made up of 
living groupings, based on movements which have overcome the narrow-mindedness 
of the &#8216;national&#8217; point of view.&#8221; To despise this position today, however, by 
charging that it did not go far enough, would be historically false. One cannot 
judge this position without taking into account the concerns which animated it. 
Compared to the extremely rapid transformation of the Communist Parties, not to 
speak of the current situation where even the leftists do not directly attack 
the concept of national defense, such a stance allows us to measure the weight 
of 50 years of counterrevolution.</p>

<p class="fst">As our final text, we reproduce an essay by Pannekoek written 
after the period dealt with in this book, because it addresses an important 
debate within the left, but also, and most importantly, because it goes beyond 
the reformist and radical versions of crisis automatism. The recently-published 
French translations of the works of Mattick and Grossmann provide a new impetus 
to this debate. We must also mention that during the period when he wrote this 
text on the crisis debate, Pannekoek still retained a &#8220;materialist&#8221; point of 
view: his conclusion does not substitute proletarian action for the &#8220;crisis&#8221;. 
Later, and especially after 1945, he would make consciousness and 
consciousness-raising the motor force of the proletarian movement. [For reasons 
of space, the Pannekoek essay has been omitted from this new revised edition in 
order to make room for other texts which have not yet appeared in English 
translation. An English translation of Pannekoek&#8217;s <i><a href="../../../archive/pannekoe/1934/collapse.htm">The Theory of the Collapse 
of Capitalism</a></i>, which was originally published in <i>Rätekorrespondenz</i> in 
June of 1934, and was later published in English translation in <i>Capital and 
Class</i> (Spring 1977, tr. by Adam Buick) can now be viewed at the Marxists.org 
website&#8212;translator&#8217;s note.]</p>
