<h3><a name="h1">1914 and Democracy</a></h3>

<p class="fst">On August 4, 1914, the socialist parliamentary delegation, 
including the left, voted in favor of the war budget. Only one socialist deputy, 
F. Kunert, abstained, but did not give his gesture any political significance. 
The parliamentary delegation obeyed the decision of the SPD Central Committee. 
The socialist trade unions did the same, and announced their opposition to all 
strikes and their support for participation in the war effort. All strikes were 
declared illegal. The anarchosyndicalist trade unions rejected the sacred union 
(<i>Burgfrieden</i>, or &#8220;civic truce&#8221;) and were immediately outlawed and 
subjected to mass arrests.</p>

<p class="fst">The 1907 Stuttgart Congress of the Socialist International had 
ended in a compromise which raised the hopes of the Left. The 
Lenin-Martov-Luxemburg amendment, which proclaimed that, in case of war, the 
&#8220;economic and political crisis created by the war should be used ... to 
precipitate the destruction of capitalist rule,&#8221; had no practical force since 
the International was quite careful not to authorize the means to implement such 
a policy.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> It was a respectable institution, recognized by the international 
bourgeoisie, which even as late as 1913 had expectations of being awarded the 
Nobel Peace Prize: had the war not taken place, it would quite likely have been 
awarded the prize in 1914.</p>

<p class="fst">Some groups and individuals then proclaimed the &#8220;collapse&#8221; of the 
Second International: the Bolsheviks, Bordiga and the left wing of the Italian 
Socialist Party, Pannekoek and Gorter, the Serbian Socialist Party, etc. The 
French, German and English parties accepted the war. The other two important 
parties (their importance was not merely numerical), the Russian and the Italian 
parties, had quite distinct positions. The two factions of the Russian Party, 
which in reality constituted two distinct parties, did not abandon the struggle 
against their own government. Italy did not enter the war at first: while an 
important minority took a revolutionary position on the war which was similar to 
that of the Zimmerwald Left, the majority of the PSI adopted a completely 
pacifist position, and was quite content not to have to take up a position 
between the two lines of fire. When Italy did enter the war, the PSI decided to 
&#8220;neither support nor sabotage&#8221; the sacred union. The Zimmerwald Left spoke of a 
&#8220;social pacifism&#8221; equivalent to &#8220;social patriotism&#8221; in other circumstances.</p>

<p class="fst">The different positions adopted by the Socialist Parties cannot 
be understood if one inters oneself in the logic of the parties themselves. The 
parties represented the general tendency of the proletariat in each country: 
almost total support on the part of the French and English proletariat for the 
war, a more subdued adherence on the part of the German proletariat, which would 
be transformed into rebellion against the war, and Russian proletarian 
defeatism. France was a democracy and its proletariat had not yet recovered from 
the defeat of the Commune: it was reformist (sometimes violently so) and was not 
oriented towards the State (whether democratic or not). In Germany, not only was 
the workers movement more powerful before 1914, but it still had the goal of 
realizing democracy in its country, something which, in those circumstances, was 
a goal which had to be approached on the level of the State. In Russia, not only 
was it a question, as in Germany, of changing the form of the State, but also of 
replacing it with a new one and changing society itself, of carrying out the 
bourgeois revolution in its entirety, since the Russian bourgeoisie was 
incapable of doing so.</p>

<p class="fst">In France, the SFIO and the trade unions marshaled the 
proletariat under the banner of defense of their democratic conquests against 
Prussian absolutism, overlooking the fact that in doing so it had to ally itself 
with a distinctly more reactionary absolutism: czarism. In Germany, the SPD&#8217;s 
rallying call was the defense of European civilization against Asian barbarism. 
In Russia, no slogan of this kind was possible. The proletariat once again took 
up the defeatist attitude it had displayed in the Russo-Japanese War: the 
military collapse of czarism in a foreign conflict would once again be the 
signal for a revolution at home, as in 1905. The Russian proletariat underwent a 
process of radicalization. After 1915, mutinies spread throughout the army. 
Lenin and the Bolsheviks became the leaders of the Zimmerwald Left.</p>

<p class="fst">The positions of the various proletariats and workers parties 
revolved around the defense or conquest of democracy. On a world scale there was 
just one proletariat. Generally, it sought improvements within the framework of 
the existing mode of production. The reformism of the West and the democratic 
revolutionism of the East were two aspects of the same reality. One could say 
that the proletariat participated in these two aspects. Even in Russia, the 
proletariat had to assure the conditions for the extension of the capitalist 
mode of production by destroying all the vestiges of previous modes of 
production. It carried out the tasks of the bourgeois revolution. In Russia as 
in all the western countries, the proletariat stood alone, because the communist 
revolution never took place: the proletariat itself was universally enlisted in 
the effort to reform capital&#8217;s economic and political rule. In Germany, where 
the proletariat was potentially powerful on a social scale (and not on the 
political level, as in Russia), the most radical tendencies of the era arose, 
oriented towards communism. In Russia, the isolated proletariat would exhaust 
itself and be submerged in capitalist tasks. In Germany, however, after the 
democratic &#8220;revolution&#8221; of November 1918, all that was left to achieve was the 
proletarian revolution.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">Developments within the SPD</a></h3>

<p class="fst">As of August 2, 1914, the trade unions banned all strikes. When 
General Ludendorff grumbled about all this trade union support, an 
Undersecretary of State responded in the following manner: &#8220;There is no doubt 
that we cannot win the war without the good will of the industrial workers. No 
one, of course, has so much influence over these workers as the trade union 
leaders. Without these leaders, and <i>a fortiori</i> against them, we can do 
nothing. Their influence rests upon the actions which they have successfully led 
for decades with the intention of improving the workers&#8217; situation ... it is 
inconceivable how we could resist if this had not been the case...&#8221;<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> The CI 
would never go so far in its analyses.</p>

<p class="fst">On August 4, the left wing of the SPD parliamentary delegation, 
K. Liebknecht and Otto Rühle, yielded to Party discipline (Luxemburg was not a 
deputy). Taken as a whole, however, the social democratic edifice, including the 
trade unions, was already beginning to crumble. The rate and methods by which 
the various tendencies would regroup in different organizations can be examined 
on three levels: parliament, party and the workers movement, with each 
influencing the others, especially from the bottom up, as the development of the 
workers movement was the foundation of the development of the left radical and 
centrist groups.</p>

<p class="fst">It was on the parliamentary level that the splits appeared and 
crystallized most quickly. The parliamentary apparatus, and, consequently, the 
reactionary tendency, possessed a monopoly of information due to the very nature 
of such an organization. Liebknecht had to go to Holland and to the various 
German States in order to be rapidly convinced that the opposition was not 
restricted to Berlin, where a small group had formed around Luxemburg, Mehring, 
etc., and where important working class sectors of the Party supported the 
opposition. On December 2, he was the first deputy to vote against the new war 
credits. Haase, leader of the centrist opposition to the war and future leader 
of the USPD, justified the vote for war credits in the name of the Party due to 
the need for national defense. On February 7, 1915, Liebknecht was mobilized, 
along with other known opponents of the war.</p>

<p class="fst">The tide of events would push Rühle, and then some twenty other 
deputies, towards the opposition. In February of 1915, Luxemburg was imprisoned 
for the first time during the war, and would not be released until February 
1916. While in prison she wrote <i>The Crisis of Social Democracy</i>, also 
known as the <i>Junius Pamphlet</i> after her pseudonym (see below). An 
international women&#8217;s peace conference convened in Berne in March 1915. The 
Germans were represented by Zetkin. The Russians would, for the first time, hear 
the voice of the international left, but the majority of the latter was still 
pacifist. This conference was preceded by a demonstration of a thousand women in 
front of the Reichstag: it was the first demonstration of the political 
opposition since the beginning of the war. During this same period, the 
oppositionist Stuttgart Party section stopped paying its dues to the Party 
leadership, which amounted to a split. On March 20, Rühle followed Liebknecht 
and refused to vote for the national budget, which the SPD approved for the 
first time in its history. Thirty deputies did not attend the parliamentary 
session so as not to participate in the vote. A series of women&#8217;s demonstrations 
led to the arrest of Zetkin. An international conference of socialist youth 
adopted a position against the war. The news from Zimmerwald, the passage of 
numerous Party sections to the opposition, the founding of the ISD and the first 
hunger riots led 18 centrist deputies into open opposition in December.</p>

<p class="fst">In early 1916, all these oppositionists were excluded from the 
parliamentary delegation. The centrists formed the social democratic Community 
of Labor (<i>Arbeitsgemeinschaft</i>), the nucleus of the future USPD. It was 
opposed to the SPD leadership&#8217;s war policy but refused to break with the Party 
until it was excluded in early 1917.</p>

<p class="fst">After the February Revolution in Russia, the German parliament 
voted for a resolution in favor of peace, in July 1917, in order to undercut the 
impact of the mass movement against the war. The State, under pressure from its 
parliament and especially the SPD (who thought they could save the economy from 
a revolution) also attempted to reform itself in the direction of a 
parliamentary democracy: the last government before November 1918 would be 
declared to be responsible before the chamber and would include SPD ministers.</p>

<p class="fst">The de-aggregation of the Party&#8217;s left was paralleled by a 
reaction on the part of the leadership. For the first time, the old radical 
current of social democracy was dispersed into numerous groups (prior to 1914, 
Luxemburg and Kautsky were both known as &#8220;radicals&#8221;). Later, a process of 
regroupment culminated in the founding of the USPD, the Spartacus League and the 
ISD.</p>

<p class="fst">The first opposition groups formed primarily in Hamburg, around 
Wolffheim and Laufenberg, and in Bremen, where the group included the majority 
of the socialist organization and could express its views in the <i>Bremer 
Bürger-Zeitung</i>, which from the very start of the war took a firm stand: 
&#8220;everything which we have said until now would amount to nothing but empty words 
unless we uphold our positions <i>during</i> and <i>after</i> the war.&#8221;<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> 
Groups also formed in Dresden, Gotha, Brunswick, Weimar, Nüremberg, Leipzig, 
Halle and various neighborhoods in Berlin. The Berlin <i>Vorwärts</i> was in the 
hands of the opposition and Rühle issued calls for a split.</p>

<p class="fst">The loyal branches of the Party diminished in number: after 
Stuttgart, Duisberg (summer 1916) and Bremen (December 1916) ceased to pay the 
Party leadership their statutory 20% dues quota. Numerous groups and individuals 
chose to leave the Party: of its 1,000,000 members in 1914, only 200,000 
remained in the SPD at the time of its September 1917 Congress.</p>

<p class="fst">The leadership&#8217;s policy was to fire the editors of its papers who 
did not support its directives, and to replace them with more docile editorial 
teams. In Berlin the affair took on the appearance of a police operation, and 
was known by the name of the &#8220;Vorwärts Robbery&#8221;: hence the occupation of the 
premises of the newspaper during the revolution, the rank and file wanting to 
recover &#8220;its&#8221; organ of expression.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">The ISD</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The ISD was formed in September 1915. It was the smallest of the 
radical currents, but it was the precursor of the postwar German Left. Its 
theoretical spokesperson before the war was Pannekoek. After August 4, 1914, 
only a few oppositionist groups decided to definitively break with the SPD and 
with everything the latter represented and entailed. The two most important 
groups were the Berlin group around the journal <i>Lichstrahlen</i> (Rays of 
Light), and the Bremen and Brunswick groups around Radek, which then comprised 
the German ultra-left.</p>

<p class="fst">Upon definitively breaking with the SPD, these groups explained 
the supposed betrayal of 1914 as being due to the social democratic form of 
organization itself. They wanted a new form of organization in which complete 
democracy would prevail: the delegates must be revocable at any moment, under 
the constant vigilance of the rank and file, etc. In this manner the formation 
of a layer of bureaucrats living on the members&#8217; dues, the &#8220;bonzes&#8221; who become 
conservatives (in politics as well) in order to preserve their positions, would 
be prevented. One of the principle refrains of the German Revolution began to be 
heard: denunciation of the leaders, praise for the masses.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Lichstrahlen</i> was founded in 1913 by Julian Borchardt. The 
very title of the magazine clearly indicated its enlightenment goal: to clarify 
the consciousness of the masses so they could take measures to free themselves 
from the influence of leaders.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> (Knowledge of the currents involved in the 
origins of the German Left is important in order to form an accurate idea of the 
latter.) Pannekoek, who was in close contact with the Bremen group, carried out 
a much more profound analysis of the causes of the apparent betrayal of 1914: 
the socialist parties corresponded to the pre-imperialist period of capitalism, 
a period characterized by the growth of the capitalist social form, in which the 
workers struggles could achieve real reforms. The socialist parties were 
structured on the basis of this situation. The body of the Party is the high 
authority, at the political level, for conducting the negotiations which lead to 
obtaining improvements in the material conditions of the proletariat. The Party 
had become well-adapted to this function, wherein revolutionary action (in which 
the masses directly intervene without any need for someone to act in their 
place, that is, in which they are no longer masses but a <i>class</i>, and 
potentially humanity) appears to the social democratic organization as a 
dangerous perspective, in general but above all in regard to its own 
preservation.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Besides the fact that it did not join the ISD, the Hamburg group 
was most notable for its connection to the revolutionary movement in the USA: 
the IWW (<i>Industrial Workers of the World</i>). Wolffheim had been a militant 
in the IWW in California for several years. The views expressed by Wolffheim and 
Laufenberg in <i>Democracy and Organization</i> were similar to the ideology of 
the IWW (see Chapter 9).<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> Their ideas also presaged German <i>unionism</i> 
(the AAU and AAU-E). Workers should not, they said, organize and struggle while 
grouped by trades and skills (as in the trade unions) because the structure of 
capitalism had changed since the formation of the first trade unions. Trades had 
long since ceased to be the basic economic units and consequently were no longer 
the locus of the class struggle of the proletariat. This unit was now the 
factory and, at a higher level, the industry. Against the monopolization and 
trustification of capitalism in its many forms, the workers could not prosecute 
an effective struggle unless they monopolized and trustified themselves at their 
workplaces, factory by factory, and then by industry: &#8220;To the monopolized form 
of industry corresponds, on the workers&#8217; side, the pure industrial union on the 
basis of the factory organization.&#8221;<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> This would, in addition, permit the still 
&#8220;unorganized&#8221; workers to join the struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">In September of 1915, various groups and individuals (among 
others, the Russian Bolsheviks and Mensheviks) held a conference in Zimmerwald 
attended by all the currents of international social democracy which were 
opposed to the Second International&#8217;s policy since the onset of the war, in 
order to build a new worldwide revolutionary organization. The 
internationalists, few in number, could be counted on the fingers of two hands.</p>

<p class="fst">From Germany, the following were represented at Zimmerwald: the <i>
International</i> group (the future Spartacus League: see below); the Bremen and 
Brunswick groups (represented by Radek); the Berlin group (Borchardt); as well 
as the centrists Ledebour and Hoffmann who took as their basis the proclamation 
of Kautsky, Haase and Bernstein demanding a peace treaty, without attacking the 
leadership of the SPD.</p>

<p class="fst">On the fundamental question of what attitude to adopt concerning 
social democracy, a split developed between the left and the center. The 
Mensheviks (Martov) and the future Spartacists joined the centrists. They 
rejected an immediate split and spoke of re-conquering social democracy. The 
left (the Bolsheviks, Roland-Holst<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> representing the Dutch SDP Left, and the 
delegates from Bremen, Brunswick and Berlin) voted for a resolution which 
stated, among other things:<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Social-patriotism and social-imperialism, defended in Germany by 
both the majority&#8212;which is openly patriotic&#8212;of the old social democrats, as well 
as by the so-called centrists grouped around Kautsky ... is an even more 
dangerous enemy of the proletariat than the bourgeois advocacy of imperialism, 
because social-imperialism, outrageously claiming to be the standard-bearer of 
socialism, can lead unenlightened workers into error&#8221; (<i>un-aufgeklärte</i>, 
always <i>Aufklärung</i>, the clarification of consciousness).</p>

<p class="fst">The resolution saw only a spiritual problem of consciousness 
where it was above all a matter of the relation of forces. But even at the level 
of the relation of forces its analyses seemed to be correct because, after the 
war, social democracy was the only effective counterrevolutionary force. 
Gorter&#8217;s <i>Imperialism, the World War and Social Democracy</i> (1915) developed 
the major theses of the Zimmerwald Left: transforming the war into a civil war 
and creating a new international. It also contains an implicit critique of the 
thesis concerning the labor bureaucracy: it was the whole proletariat (and not 
just its highest layers) which had been &#8220;corrupted&#8221;, that is, it had seen its 
material situation improve through its struggles, thanks to the rise in the rate 
of profit in the preceding period.</p>

<p class="fst">Gorter and Pannekoek, who could not attend the Zimmerwald 
Conference, supported the left. Pannekoek and Roland-Holst sent money (the SDP 
did not want to become involved in this kind of activity). They were entrusted 
with editing and publishing a German-language international organ, <i>Vorbote</i> 
(the Precursor), whose other collaborators were Lenin, Radek, Zinoviev and 
Gorter. Only two issues appeared as a result of disputes within the small group, 
due in part to the Bolsheviks&#8217; sensitivities. One such dispute, for example, 
involved Roland-Holst and Trotsky.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This collaboration within the framework of the Zimmerwald Left is 
one of the elements which help to explain the German Left&#8217;s misunderstandings 
concerning the Bolshevik seizure of power and the Third International at the 
time of its founding. When Lenin and the leadership of the Third International 
began to attack the &#8220;leftists&#8221;, the latter would long believe that this was a 
result of a lack of information.</p>

<p class="fst">The Bolsheviks, and the German, Dutch, Bulgarian and Italian 
Lefts, were unique in their espousal during the war of the revolutionary 
position against social democracy and their advocacy of the realistic and 
revolutionary watchword: no to peace, transform the war between nations into a 
civil war to seize power.</p>

<p class="fst">It was upon this set of positions that the Bremen, Brunswick and 
Berlin Lefts founded the <i>Internazionale Sozialisten Deutschlands</i> (ISD): 
the International Socialists of Germany. Their organ was <i>Lichstrahlen</i> and 
later, after that journal was shut down in April 1916, the Bremen <i>
Arbeiterpolitik</i> (Workers Politics), published after the SPD took over the <i>
Bremer Bürger-Zeitung</i> in June 1916.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> In December of 1916 they ceased to 
pay their dues to the SPD leadership and were joined by the radicals of 
Brunswick and Hamburg, although the latter did not immediately enter the ISD. 
Numerous individual members and entire sections of the Spartacus League were in 
agreement with the ISD&#8217;s views concerning the need to create a left radical 
organization totally independent of social democracy: the Dresden sections 
(Rühle), for example, and those of Frankfurt and Duisburg. One can thus 
understand why, while it was less important during the war than Spartacus, the 
ISD&#8212;or at least its theses&#8212;enjoyed the support of the majority at the founding 
Congress of the German CP (see Chapter 6).</p>

<p class="fst">The two touchstones of the left at the founding Congress of the 
German CP would, in effect, be electoral abstentionism and sabotage of the trade 
unions. These two positions were arrived at by the ISD in the course of its 
theoretical development, greatly influenced by the workers movement during the 
war. It was in <i>Arbeiterpolitik</i> that, for the first time, the watchword of 
the German Revolution appeared: <i>Heraus den Gewerkschaften!</i> (Out of the 
Trade Unions!), at first to be subjected to criticism, and later to be adopted. 
Much the same thing took place regarding the concept of the <i>unitary 
organization</i> which was expressed for the first time in 1917 in the same 
journal. This idea would be re-appropriated and further elaborated by Wolffheim 
and Laufenberg, providing the first theoretical foundations of the AAU. But the 
German Left went beyond the IWW: instead of basing itself on economic 
organizations which rejected politics, it wanted to positively overcome the 
rupture between political and economic organizations. Finally, the critique of 
social democracy and its methods led the ISD to the rejection of parliamentarism 
as a tactic which fatally led to the domination of the parliamentary delegation 
over the rest of the Party which would thus become the instrument for purely 
electoral ends. The later theoretical elaborations of this current are clearly 
of great interest today: <i>World Revolution and Communist Tactics</i>, by 
Pannekoek, as well as three texts by Rühle: <i>The Revolution is Not a Party 
Matter!</i>, <i>Fundamental Questions of Organization</i>, and <i>From the 
Bourgeois to the Proletarian Revolution</i>.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">The USPD</a></h3>

<p class="fst">As the Left maintained, the USPD was a &#8220;party of leaders&#8221;, 
created by &#8220;leaders&#8221; to lead the &#8220;masses&#8221;. At the beginning of 1917, after a 
national conference of oppositionists, which was attended by the social 
democratic Community of Labor, the Spartacus League and <i>Lichstrahlen</i> 
(these groups contributing 111, 34 and 7 delegates, respectively) and which 
voted to remain in the SPD, the Community of Labor and the Spartacists were 
excluded from the SPD. In April, the centrists created the USPD, the Independent 
Social Democratic Party, which the Spartacus League joined as an autonomous 
group. It was an important party which would receive 2.5 million votes in the 
1919 elections. Drawn from the SPD Left, which comprised many of its sections, 
it had its own trade union organization in the &#8220;revolutionary shop stewards&#8221; 
(see below), an oppositionist trade union organization born during the war.</p>

<p class="fst">The Independents denounced the existing German State as &#8220;the 
State of the Middle Classes&#8221; and wanted a State of the working class.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> This 
position differs from both Bernstein&#8217;s stance at the turn of the century which 
was in favor of an SPD-Liberal alliance, as well as from that of the defenders 
of imperialism, who were supporters of a working class-big capital alliance 
against the liberal bourgeoisie and the middle classes, a program which would be 
more or less realized by the Nazis. The USPD extended traditional liberalism by 
mixing it with a laborism of workers ideology. The numerous workers who 
supported it were against the revolution as well as the authoritarianism and 
bureaucratism of the SPD and the ADGB. Historically, this Party expressed the 
ambiguous character of a (numerous) fraction of workers whose confusion would be 
augmented by defeat.</p>

<p class="fst">In conformity with its dualism, it was the Party where all 
compromises found a place. Whenever its left wing launched or reactivated an 
action, it began negotiating from the very moment that the action appeared to 
become dangerous to the established order. It had a left wing which took to the 
streets (the Spartacists, at the beginning, and leaders like Ledebour who had 
connections with the shop stewards), and a right wing which undertook 
parliamentary maneuvers. After the sailors had established contact with the USPD 
during the summer of 1917 (see the next Chapter), it abandoned them the moment 
they were repressed and denied any responsibility for their actions. A leader of 
the USPD declared: &#8220;We have tried to channel the justified indignation of the 
masses into legal political action.&#8221;<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> These &#8220;pure&#8221; social democrats wanted 
social democracy without its natural consequence: social democracy&#8217;s 
counterrevolutionary future. Their critique, like Luxemburg&#8217;s, was directed at 
the &#8220;official authorities&#8221;, the &#8220;current leaders&#8221; of the SPD, but never at the 
SPD as such.</p>

<p class="fst">The USPD was the German expression of the international 
phenomenon Lenin designated as &#8220;centrism&#8221;: the center of the Italian SP under 
Serrati, the Independent Labour Party in England, the majority of the SFIO in 
France. Yet this center would be the object of the CI&#8217;s efforts to swell the 
ranks of the CPs. For the revolutionaries, centrism was defined and fought on 
the basis of its dynamic: blocking the evolution of reformist positions towards 
radical action. The USPD would play this role to perfection.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">The Spartacist League</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The Spartacist League included both the future rightist leaders 
of the KPD (Luxemburg, Leo Jogisches, Levi, Pieck&#8212;the future president of the 
GDR&#8212;Zetkin), as well as future KAPists (Rühle, Bergmann, Meyer). Others, like 
Liebknecht, occupied an intermediate position in the revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The Spartacist League suffered from a problem which would be 
reproduced on a larger scale during the KPD&#8217;s first few months: a left majority 
and a right-wing leadership, with the left not daring to make a clean break to 
join the ISD. In 1915, the Spartacist League was known as the International 
group, which was the name of the single issue of a journal which it published. 
In 1916 it became the Spartacist Group or League: starting in January 1916, 
Luxemburg published a series of political letters under the signature of 
&#8220;Spartacus&#8221;, and the &#8220;Spartacus&#8221; journal appeared in September. Its two 
theoreticians were Liebknecht and Luxemburg. For his valiant and spectacular 
opposition to the war, Liebknecht was the most popular of the &#8220;social democratic 
leaders&#8221; in Germany. He was the first to refuse to vote for war credits. For 
having shouted &#8220;Down with the war! Down with the government!&#8221; at the May Day 
demonstration in 1916, he was arrested and condemned to a sentence of four years 
in prison, etc. It was in prison where he elaborated his positions, which are 
summarized below.</p>

<p class="fst">If Luxemburg was the author of the formula, &#8220;After August 4, 
1914, social democracy is nothing but a nauseating corpse,&#8221; she proved to be 
quite a necrophiliac. She played a perfectly reactionary role, utilizing all the 
resources of her dialectic and all her authority to prevent the revolutionaries 
from cutting the ties which bound them to that &#8220;corpse&#8221; under the pretext that 
the masses were found there and that they must not separate themselves from 
them. Her trenchant formulas and intricate dialectics often concealed a lack of 
deep analysis:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;However laudable and understandable the impatience and 
bitterness which today lead the best elements to leave the Party (we should 
recall that 4/5 of the Party has thus abandoned it), flight is still flight. For 
us, this means a betrayal of the masses who are struggling and suffocating, 
caught in the snares of the Scheidemanns and the Legiens (socialist leader and 
the leader of the ADGB, respectively), who enjoy the favor of the bourgeoisie. 
One can &#8216;leave&#8217; small sects and little cults when they no longer please, in 
order to found new sects and new cults. To attempt, by means of a simple 
&#8220;departure&#8221;, to free the proletarian masses from the horribly heavy and 
disastrous yoke of the bourgeoisie and to thus set a good example for them, is 
purely imaginary. To entertain the illusion of freeing the masses by tearing up 
the militants&#8217; membership cards is nothing but the inverted expression of the 
fetishism of the Party membership card as an illusory power. Both these 
attitudes are merely different poles of institutional cretinism, an illness 
inherent to the old social democracy.&#8221;<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The <i>Spartacus Letter</i> of March 30, 1916, concerning the 
founding of the Community of Labor, concluded in this fashion: &#8220;The watchword is 
neither schism, nor unity, nor new party, nor old party, but the <i>re-conquest 
of the Party from the bottom up</i> by means of the rebellion of the masses who 
must take their organizations and instruments into their own hands, not with a 
rebellion of words, but of deeds.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This tactic was similar to the centrist position of the 
Spartacists at Zimmerwald: refusing to publicly denounce the Kautskyist center 
and to accept Lenin&#8217;s and Gorter&#8217;s, <i>et al.</i>, slogans against the war, 
Luxemburg and Liebknecht underwent the following evolution. At first, they 
propagandized in favor of a &#8220;just&#8221; peace without annexations, defined as a 
&#8220;socialist peace&#8221;. At the meeting of the SPD shop stewards held in 
Charlottenburg on December 30, 1914, Liebknecht proposed a vote on a &#8220;Resolution 
on the nature of the war and the tasks of the working class&#8221; in which he said: 
&#8220;The goal of the socialists is to obtain through struggle a peace without 
annexations, without humiliating any country, and to do everything possible to 
reinforce the movement for such a socialist peace in all countries concerned.&#8221; 
Later, the conclusion of the <i>Junius Pamphlet</i> (&#8220;Theses on the Tasks of 
International Social Democracy&#8221;) launched the slogan &#8220;War against War&#8221;, which 
was susceptible of many different interpretations. Luxemburg would long remain 
bound to the socialist conception of the war. Jaurés&#8217;s phrase is well-known: 
&#8220;Capitalism brings war the way clouds bring a storm.&#8221; The Zimmerwald Left went 
so far as to add a third term: war leads to revolution. The slogan, &#8220;War against 
War&#8221; remains in the social democratic camp.</p>

<p class="fst">Liebknecht developed an original position on organization. He had 
seen that, except for those made by Pannekoek, the &#8220;leftist&#8221; critiques of the 
social democratic form of organization were quite superficial and effectively 
revealed a degree of organizational fetishism. He attempted to oppose to an 
organizational form which favored the leaders and the counterrevolution, another 
form which would favor the &#8220;self-activity of the masses&#8221;. This leftist point of 
view was expounded by Liebknecht in his prison writings and was shared by the 
majority of the Spartacist League:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;To eliminate the paid bureaucracy, or to exclude it from all 
decision-making processes; to limit it to technical labor; to prohibit the 
re-election of all officials, after a maximum time served ..., to reduce the 
power of high-level positions; <i>decentralization</i>; vote by the rank and 
file on all important questions (veto power)... To teach the masses and 
individuals intellectual and moral independence, to question authority, to take 
the initiative and personal responsibility, so that each person would be 
prepared for and capable of free action: all these things comprise the only sure 
foundation for the development of a workers movement which would be equal to its 
historic tasks, in general, and this is also the precondition and essential 
basis for the extirpation of the bureaucratic danger.&#8221;<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Luxemburg did not want to become involved in this kind of 
critique. She broke with social democracy, but only reluctantly, and helped 
retard the construction of a new, entirely autonomous radical organization. Her 
1904 polemic with Lenin, however, showed that she was by no means a devotee of 
organizational fetishism.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> It is impossible to agree with Laufenberg when, in 
1920, he wrote in <i>Communism versus Spartacism</i>: &#8220;Luxemburg never freed 
herself from the social democratic form of <i>organization</i>.&#8221; Laufenberg&#8217;s 
critique issued from the mystified point of view expressed by Liebknecht above. 
All the debates within the German Left are generally very confused.</p>

<p class="fst">There was, then, an important Left, which was even in the 
majority within the Spartacist League; but it did not distinguish itself in 
relation to its centrist leadership, represented by Luxemburg. The Spartacist 
League itself remained an autonomous group within the USPD, which, for its part, 
never lost hope of reunification with the SPD.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h6">Labor Agitation and the &#8220;Shop Stewards&#8221;</a></h3>

<p class="fst">All strikes were prohibited by the trade unions as a &#8220;betrayal of 
our brothers at the front&#8221;. As a result, everything was very clear from the 
beginning on the labor front, as far as organizations were concerned: in every 
strike, a new organization was born in each factory, led by the &#8220;revolutionary 
shop stewards&#8221;. These men were generally regularly-elected trade union delegates 
who did not follow the official line of the ADGB&#8217;s Central Committee. The new 
structures were based on the <i>factory</i>, and these factory organizations (<i>BO, 
Betriebsorganisation</i>) were organized by <i>industrial</i> regions (for 
example, the workers council of Greater Berlin), in accordance with the 
technical structure of capital during that era. This form of organization would 
be adopted and theorized by the German Left (KAPD, AAU), and was also the embryo 
of the future workers councils. The shop stewards held effective leadership over 
all strikes, and called them off without any negotiations when they felt that 
the strike movement was in no position to make the State back down. Starting and 
stopping strikes almost at will, the shop stewards were the most authentic 
expression of the labor rank and file at that time: they comprised its executive 
organ. Constantly spreading, the strikes were supposed to have terminated in the 
insurrectionary general strike. The shop stewards would elaborate a plan for 
November 1918 along such lines which, as it turned out, could not be executed: 
once again, it became obvious that the revolution would begin spontaneously 
before the D-Day foreseen by all the leaders. Later, when this revolution 
directly posed problems at the level of the State, once the struggle became 
directly political, the shop stewards in fact proved incapable of leading it: 
they generally rallied to the USPD as their political party. Incapable of 
transcending the limitations of the factory, they left it only in order to fall 
prey to the limitations of political democracy. Opposed to mass action, which 
they considered to be &#8220;revolutionary gymnastics&#8221;, the <i>Revolutionäre Obleute</i> 
(<i>RO</i>) proved that the mere fact of their working class and factory 
background did not confer upon them any more immunity against opportunism and 
immediatism than was the case with social groups &#8220;outside&#8221; the factories. The 
most radical sectors of the proletariat (the &#8220;left&#8221;) would not clearly emerge 
until the revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The first disturbances were hunger riots accompanied by looting 
of stores, in October 1915 in Chemnitz, and later, during May-June 1916, 
demonstrations were held in numerous cities in solidarity with Liebknecht, who 
was on trial at the time for his seditious outbursts. In March-April 1917, a new 
wave of strikes took place. On April 16, what has come to be known as the first 
workers council in Germany was born in Leipzig; it was called a &#8220;committee&#8221; and 
was composed for the most part of members of the USPD, with a democratic 
pacifist and reformist program. The goals of the workers movement did not 
surpass this level until November 1918: but its direct methods allowed a glimpse 
beyond its initial goals.</p>

<p class="fst">The movements in the provinces were followed by a large strike in 
Berlin (250,000 workers) which spread like wildfire to central Germany from 
April 16 to 23 of 1917. On the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, the Knorr-Bremse factory elected 
a workers council with Spartacist tendencies. This strike was so significant 
that the ADGB permanent committee took the decision to compel new elections: the 
old rightists were replaced by new rightists. It was the first manifestation of 
the democratic offensive, a procedure which was to be extensively employed 
during the revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The strikes of January 1918 were an extension of the strikes in 
Austria. Their international purpose was to exert pressure on the German and 
Austrian negotiators at Brest-Litovsk. Except for the latter, the movement&#8217;s 
goals were identical, but the strike was observed by more than one million 
workers. At the end of 1918, at the time of the &#8220;revolution&#8221;, the proletariat 
would again take up the attitude of the strikers of January, and it would be 
defeated. The expansion of the strike simultaneously made it clear how the 
various political groups were excluded from the practical initiatives which 
originated among the rank and file, only later managing to take control of the 
movement: at the time of the announcement of the events in Austria, the 
atmosphere in Berlin was dominated by strikes. The USPD was sympathetic and the 
Spartacists supported the strike, which was ultimately decided upon by the shop 
stewards. 400,000 workers did not go to work and elected a &#8220;Russian-style&#8221; 
council composed of delegates from all the city&#8217;s factories (analogous to the 
St. Petersburg Soviet), which had 400 delegates. The delegates in turn elected 
an Action Committee composed of eleven shop stewards who, despite protests, then 
co-opted three members of the USPD and three members of the SPD. The USPD 
representatives were Ledebour, Haase (who had justified the SPD&#8217;s vote for war 
credits while Liebknecht argued against it) and Dittmann (who became famous in 
Kiel when his party abandoned the sailors: see the next Chapter). The SPD 
representatives were Scheidemann, Braun and Ebert; the latter would later 
declare, in order to justify his action to his party&#8217;s extreme right, that he 
had only joined this Action Committee in order to sabotage the movement.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The strike spread in Berlin and in all the large cities (with 
more than one million workers on strike). The government&#8217;s reaction was violent: 
the Berlin factories and the shipyards of Hamburg and Kiel were placed under 
martial law. The SPD pushed for negotiations, the Spartacists wanted the 
disturbances to lead to insurrection, but the shop stewards called an end to the 
movement on February 3.</p>
