<h3><a name="h1">Capitalism and the Proletariat</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In 1914, Germany was well on the way to becoming the world&#8217;s 
leading economic power. It was particularly characterized by its new capitalist 
development, equipped with the most modern plant and infrastructure. Its labor 
productivity, achieved by means of the application of the most modern 
technologies to the production process, was higher than that of the other 
capitalist countries: the intensity and skill of its labor required less labor 
time to manufacture the same product.</p>

<p class="fst">The ratio of constant to variable capital was higher in Germany 
than in the other capitalist countries. The commercial prices of German products 
were lower than the average prices on the world market: Germany extracted and 
appropriated part of the surplus value produced by other fractions of world 
capital, or, expressed more precisely, of the world proletariat. This 
appropriation of surplus value not produced in Germany gave German capitalism a 
greater capacity for accumulation, modernization and new productivity gains. It 
also allowed a significant rise in wages benefiting not just a minority, but all 
the workers in Germany. One can only speak of a &#8220;labor aristocracy&#8221; in the case 
of professionals and highly-skilled workers (see below for discussion of this 
notion). This situation enjoyed by German capitalism formed the basis for the 
reformist politics of the German proletariat up to 1914, as well as that of the 
reformist socialist party, and of the German trade unions which were among the 
largest in the world; the following table provides comparative rates of 
unionization in the respective labor forces of three large capitalist countries:<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Only the survival of these organizations, which had become 
autonomous in relation to the proletariat, gave any real force to the 
persistence of what has been called the &#8220;reformist spirit&#8221; which still held sway 
over the majority of the German proletariat after 1918. Between 1871 and 1913, 
real per capita income doubled in Germany and Great Britain, and tripled in the 
United States. There seemed to be no net progress, however, during the decade 
leading up to 1914 in Germany, England or France: instead, economic progress for 
the German workers was measured by the reduction of working time.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> Wage 
differentials between skilled and unskilled workers rose between 1871 and 1913, 
falling only after 1914. These differentials fell from 31% to 18% in the 
railroads, and from 25% to 10% in construction (in Berlin, Hamburg and Stettin) 
between 1914 and 1918. At the same time, real wages decreased by 35% between 
1914 and 1918: in 1921, they were still 10% below their 1914 level.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> It is 
likely that the pre-1914 division<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> between skilled workers (organized in trade 
unions) and unskilled workers (usually unorganized) gave way after the war to a 
division between employed and unemployed workers, even though the possession of 
a job did not necessarily correspond with reformism, nor did unemployment 
necessarily correspond with revolutionary inclinations. The &#8220;unions&#8221; (AAU), born 
after 1919, consisted of employed workers, as was clearly demonstrated by the 
fact that they were composed of revolutionary <i>factory</i> organizations.</p>

<p class="fst">It was the relatively most modern characteristics of German 
capitalism which provided the conditions most conducive to the success of the 
proletarian revolution, and which made Germany the bastion of the world 
revolution. Not only was its organic composition of capital (proportion of 
constant to variable capital) higher than that of any other country, but the 
same was true of the relation between fixed and circulating capital.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a><a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> 
The enormous importance, both in relative and absolute terms, of &#8220;dead&#8221; labor 
accumulated by past generations, which confers upon the current generation a 
greater net labor productivity, is a precondition which enormously facilitates 
the transition to communism, in which all needs must be satisfied and in which 
the labor time necessary for the preservation of life must, consequently, be 
considerably reduced. Communism is not, however, generalized automation, but an 
equilibrium between the &#8220;naturalization of man&#8221; and the &#8220;humanization of 
nature&#8221;, and it is foreseeable that the inauguration of a human life will not 
only reduce the need for objects, but will also set human activity free, and 
leave behind the memory of the parsimony of &#8220;so many hours&#8221; spent under the wage 
regime.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> The coexistence of the reformist practice of the German working class 
along with certain material preconditions for communism would be manifested in 
such demands as the six or even the five hour day.</p>

<p class="fst">Another consequence of Germany&#8217;s high level of productivity was 
the fact that large factories clearly comprised the most representative sector 
of German capitalism. Automated machinery does not require professional workers 
who understand their jobs; the <i>OS</i> (unskilled workers) predominated in 
this sector: the 20,000 workers of the Leuna chemical works were typical 
representatives of this phenomenon (see Chapter 15). These <i>OS</i> were 
located on the fringes of the traditional trade union domain, which exclusively 
preserved its trade-defined structure from the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century. 
Organization by trade was a principle which ruled both reformist as well as 
revolutionary trade unionism. The <i>OS</i> were not part of the old 
trade-oriented world of the skilled workers. The concrete aspect of their labor, 
which is the concrete realization of the abstract and indifferent character of 
commodity-producing labor as such (see <i>Capital</i>, Vol. I, Chapter I), 
stimulates no interest in them at all. Wage labor, in which man exchanges his 
labor power as if it were something distinct from himself, preserves the 
individual as a man crushed and dissolved by the means of production in the form 
of capital. One of the new concrete qualities of labor in the large factories 
was its <i>collective</i> character: the product was not the result of the 
efforts of anyone in particular, but of the common efforts of all who work in 
the factories. Any one person&#8217;s labor cannot become pleasant nor can it be 
considered as a useful personal contribution unless it is experienced as a 
moment of a whole to which one feels connected. Wage labor, however, wherein 
man, in order to live, sells his labor power, preserves the individual as such 
and prevents the formation of a community which can only be the result of a 
system of communist production. Wage labor does, of course, have a collective 
dimension, but it pertains to capital: the only really existing community is 
that of the reproduction of capital.</p>

<p class="fst">Prior to the war, this mass of unskilled workers did not form 
part of the German trade unions, which had between two and three million 
members. There were two parallel trade union organizations. The socialist <i>
Zentrale</i>, by far the larger of the two, brought together various &#8220;free trade 
unions&#8221; in a federation known in 1918-1919 as the ADGB (General Federation of 
German Trade Unions). The other federation, the anarchosyndicalist or 
revolutionary syndicalist <i>Zentrale</i>, the FVDG (Federation of Free German 
Trade Unions), became the FAUD at the end of 1919 with the entry of numerous 
recently-created factory organizations (see Chapter 9). Before 1914, the sector 
which provided the basis for both <i>Zentrales</i> was composed of workers in 
the skilled trades: the FVDG was largely based among the construction workers.</p>

<p class="fst">The <i>OS</i>, on the other hand, together with the 
&#8220;revolutionary shop stewards&#8221; who were still members of the trade unions (see 
Chapter 4), created the &#8220;factory organizations&#8221; during the war, and later formed 
the autonomous &#8220;left&#8221; radical organizations of the proletariat: the AAUs 
(General Workers Unions). The trade unions could no longer ignore this majority 
of the proletariat, even though only the most radical minority of the <i>OS</i> 
joined the AAU. The skilled workers, previously reticent about admitting 
unskilled workers into the trade unions, welcomed them after 1919. The trade 
unions, which in fact adopted an organizational structure based on factory and 
industry, soon had nine million members. This development was also encouraged by 
pressure from capitalists who refused to enter into contracts with workers who 
were not members of the trade unions (see the KAPD <i>Program</i>).</p>

<p class="fst">The enormous growth of the trade unions proves that, despite the 
strength of its radical currents, the German proletariat was still, taken as a 
whole, reformist. One cannot speak of a labor aristocracy except in the case of 
a few sectors (generally the skilled, and some others as a result of their 
particular situations) which defended certain privileges against the other more 
numerous sectors (today such a division exists on an international scale). But 
even the most privileged sectors of the proletariat can become seeds of 
revolution if capital is compelled to submit their privileges to examination; 
just as, conversely, the other non-privileged sectors are not permanently 
compelled to be revolutionary, and it cannot be said that when they act in a 
reformist manner they do so because they are manipulated by corrupt or bribed 
elements. One cannot be manipulated for decades unless one is effectively 
manipulable. In his pamphlet on imperialism, Gorter treated all proletarians, 
without distinction, as &#8220;lackeys&#8221;. These sectors benefited from the 
super-profits obtained by capital thanks to its favorable or dominant position 
in the world market. One cannot speak of a &#8220;minority&#8221; within the German 
proletariat except to designate the minority of <i>revolutionaries</i> 
confronting the workers as a whole.</p>

<p class="fst">Understood as a minority which lives at the expense of the 
workers movement (&#8220;bureaucrats&#8221; of the party, the trade unions, the 
cooperatives, etc.), the labor aristocracy is a definite sociological reality. 
But its activities do not explain everything.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> Although materially favored, 
certain sectors can behave in the most radical fashion, since economic 
determination is not only a question of wages. During the war, a large number of 
metal workers were supporters of peace. One cannot refer to the &#8220;economy&#8221;, or 
the &#8220;spirit&#8221;, but only to the totality of real relations. As long as the war 
seemed inevitable, the mobilized worker supported it and actively participated 
in it, since the solidarity of the trenches was the only tangible reality 
remaining to him. The worker who was still at his workbench, often due to his 
skilled status, and, consequently, because he belonged to a privileged category, 
was subjected to more difficult working conditions and rebelled against the war, 
which for him was not so much an experienced reality as a threat: he might be 
mobilized.</p>

<p class="fst">The organization of workers into <i>unions</i> (<i>unionen</i>, 
in German; not to be confused with the &#8220;unions&#8221; of the English-speaking world, 
whose counterparts in this text shall be referred to on all occasions as &#8220;trade 
unions&#8221;&#8212;tr. note) or councils, formed especially during the extensive 
mass strike movement, corresponds to the transition from the &#8220;tool-machine 
phase&#8221; to the &#8220;specialized machinery phase&#8221;<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a>: an epoch during which the trade 
unions passed from reformism (although not yet integrated into the State), to 
systematic collaboration, and capital passed from surrounding life, to totally 
penetrating life. At this juncture the proletariat made the workplace the site 
of its attempt to achieve unity because the workplace was not yet totally 
conquered by capital.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> Many workers still worked on tool-machines. They were 
trained within the old trade union framework, and demonstrated the results of 
this training in the factories where they worked, where they preserved a 
relative autonomy and carried out many tasks. This stage of <i>large-scale 
mechanized industry</i> progressively yielded&#8212;later, with the war and then 
during the twenties, at an accelerated pace&#8212;to the stage of the <i>OS</i> and of 
the scientific organization of labor. There is no rupture between these two 
mutually interconnected periods; the struggles which developed immediately after 
the war, however, comprised the meeting point of the two phases.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> In the 
United States and Canada, within a more modern capitalism, the most intense 
proletarian movement arose among the <i>OS</i> (who were often recent 
immigrants)<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> who tried to unite in the IWW (see Chapter 9). The councils 
constituted an attempt on the part of the proletarians to form autonomous 
groups: they were forced to do so; there was no other way to carry out any kind 
of struggle, even a simple reformist struggle. In their collaboration with the 
bourgeoisie, the trade unions went so far as to give their approval to the 
prohibition of strikes, and even prohibited them themselves; the councils were 
therefore above all compelled to undertake the tasks which the trade unions no 
longer fulfilled. Their form (organization by factory, uniting organized and 
unorganized workers) was better-adapted for an effective reformist struggle 
against modern capitalism. But the control of the entire productive apparatus by 
workers councils is in no way revolutionary if the workers limit themselves to 
administering what has fallen into their hands in the same way as before, or 
even better, with greater efficiency than before. Capitalist society, although 
managed by the workers themselves, would still be capitalist.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">The German State</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Germany underwent an abortive bourgeois and national revolution 
at the beginning of the sixteenth century. The Peasant War, which was also a 
semi-communist movement, was at the same time the military organization of the 
aspirations of a stratum of middle peasants who (like the bourgeoisie) wanted to 
eliminate feudal obstacles to agricultural production and its commercialization. 
This bourgeois revolution was aborted, in part due to fear of the intervention 
of the popular classes, and its failure strengthened the power of the nobility. 
The patchwork parcelization of Germany would last for another two centuries.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> 
The same phenomenon was repeated in 1848. The bourgeoisie, fearing&#8212;among other 
things&#8212;the workers uprisings, did not dare to make their revolution. Rather than 
a result of foreign pressure (particularly that of Russia, which was exaggerated 
by Marx), this was more due to the weakness of those domestic factors favoring 
German unification, which condemned Germany to await its national 
revolution.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The German State was an expanded version of the Prussian 
bureaucracy which was renovated during the Bismarck era, that is, after the 
wake-up call delivered to all of Germany in 1848. It was &#8220;imperial absolutism&#8221;: 
the state&#8217;s ministries, whose officials were nominated by and answerable to the 
emperor, were staffed by cooptation from above. There was, of course, a 
parliament, but it was deprived of the essential &#8220;executive&#8221; power and was 
consequently impotent. German unification was quite recent. Each <i>Land</i><a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> 
had its parliament, the <i>Landtag</i> (diet). In the Prussian <i>Land</i>, 
which alone represented one-half of Germany, elections were held according to 
&#8220;estates&#8221; analogous to those of the Middle Ages. The population was divided 
into, and voted as, members of orders or estates (<i>Stand</i>) (nobles, 
landowners, peasants, city-dwellers, etc.). Each estate received an equal number 
of representatives. In the 1908 Prussian elections, the SPD obtained six seats 
with 600,000 votes, while the Conservatives obtained 212 seats with 4,000,000 
votes. In Hamburg, Germany&#8217;s second-largest city and Europe&#8217;s busiest port, 
whose population doubled between 1890 and 1910, a similar electoral system 
prevailed: after 1890, one-third of its <i>Reichstag</i> deputies were 
socialists, but only twenty out of 160 delegates to Hamburg&#8217;s local diet 
belonged to the SPD.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> Germany would not know real parliamentarism until the 
latter had become fully counterrevolutionary: having lost all social 
significance with bourgeois unification, its sole function then became the 
counterrevolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The recent character of Germany&#8217;s national unification would also 
be demonstrated by the fact that, as a whole, the German labor movement would 
think and act at the level of the <i>Land</i>, even after 1918. The revolution 
would take power in various <i>Länder</i>, but never in the whole Reich. &#8220;One of 
the characteristic aspects of the German workers movement has been its 
fragmentation into various powerful centers, potent and concentrated, but 
relatively isolated from each other. This situation, so unlike that of France, 
for example, is the result of the absence of a single political capital...&#8221;<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> 
At its formation the German State was conceded a major role in intervening in 
favor of the workers (the Bismarckian social laws), but it was kept at a 
distance from industry, over which it exercised a weaker control than the State 
did in the other developed countries. In 1914, it badly organized the transition 
to the war economy, and barely integrated the occupied regions of Belgium and 
France. German &#8220;State capitalism&#8221; was economically inefficient during the war 
years of 1914 to 1918.<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> Trade-union/army collaboration would begin during the 
war, since these were the two institutions capable of joint action on a national 
scale to direct available labor power to those sectors where it was most needed. 
The government of Hamburg therefore passed, during the conflict, from civilian 
to military hands due to the incompetence of the bourgeoisie: it was in order to 
mitigate the latter&#8217;s failings that the army assumed such an important 
centralizing role.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">The Inconclusive Bourgeois Revolution</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The German bourgeoisie had a seminal weak point whose causes were 
summarized by Marx.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> The bourgeoisie received the framework for its later 
development (the Reich) from the hands of the Prussian military-bureaucratic 
apparatus, upon which it was utterly dependent for its survival. Hence the 
contradictory coexistence of a capitalism which was highly-developed for its 
epoch and a bourgeoisie which was economically powerful but acted within the 
confines of a political form inherited from the end of the Middle Ages: an 
absolute bureaucratic monarchy, alongside a powerless parliament.</p>

<p class="fst">Similarly, the German bourgeoisie would receive democracy not 
from the hands of its own class but from those of another. It was the 
proletariat which would carry the democratic revolution of 1918 to victory. 
Until June 1920, the first governments of the new democratic and parliamentary 
Germany were dominated by the SPD, the largest workers party in the world, and 
as such the best-prepared to repress the proletarian revolution. As in Russia, 
these governments would call themselves the &#8220;Council of Peoples Commissars&#8221;. The 
socialist leader Ebert would be the first president of the republic. Until 1933, 
many provincial governments and diets (in the <i>Länder</i>), particularly in 
Prussia, would be dominated by the social democrats. The next form of the 
political rule of German capitalism would, furthermore, be denominated as 
national-<i>socialist</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The struggle for democracy was one of the principle components of 
the SPD. The need for a democratic transformation of the German State, and the 
participation of the proletarians in this struggle (which implies violence) 
placed the German revolutionary movement after 1918, despite its novel aspects 
(which comprise the subject matter at the heart of this text) in line with the 
revolutionary movements of the 20<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century. The social revolution 
was pursued by way of the democratic political revolution.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a></p>
