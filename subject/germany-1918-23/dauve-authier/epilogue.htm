&#8212;Lenin to Gorter, during their discussion in Moscow, November 
1920.</p>

<h2><a name="h1">The Workers Revolution and Beyond</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The publication of an anthology is a sign that a movement no 
longer exists. Publishing another anthology thirty years later is a confession 
that a new movement has not arisen. Leaving the reader to draw his own 
conclusions from the texts and the facts assembled here, we would only like to 
set forth the perspective which informed the production of this work.</p>

<p class="fst">There can be no doubt that there have never been so many history 
books sold, but the &#8220;duty to record&#8221; evidently does not apply to revolutions. Of 
the three great attempts at emancipation which marked the first half of the 20<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> 
century, two are known well-enough despite the layers of hagiography and calumny 
with which they are covered: Russia after 1917 and Spain in 1936. For these two 
series of events, the interested reader may avail himself of a minimum of 
contradictory accounts, documents and analyses.</p>

<p class="fst">Such is not the case for the third attempt: the German 
revolution, which, without any doubt, had too much power and meaning for the 
world to accept looking at it face-to-face. It remains the only revolution to 
have broken out in a &#8220;modern&#8221; country, that is, one which was highly 
industrialized and enjoyed a (relatively) democratic political life, and thus 
the one which was most similar to the revolutionary uprisings we may live to 
see.</p>

<p class="fst">To the slight extent that they show any interest in it, 
historians retain, first of all, one name, that of Rosa Luxemburg, sometimes in 
association with that of Karl Liebknecht. The bourgeoisie likes dead 
revolutionaries. In the 1970s, the same German State that murdered Luxemburg 
issued a postage stamp in her memory. As for the workers movement, for a long 
time the Stalinists made &#8220;Rosa&#8221; into one of their icons, and the Social 
Democrats selectively preserved, for their own benefit and in a merely 
democratic sense, Luxemburg&#8217;s critique of Lenin. In the best cases, the Bavarian 
experience and Kurt Eisner would eventually be added. Basically, however, 
interest has been restricted to one group: the Spartacists. The memory of one of 
Lenin&#8217;s famous books is evoked in <i>Obsolete Communism, the Left-Wing 
Alternative</i>, written by the Cohn-Bendit brothers after 1968,<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> whose title 
is a kind of reversal of <i>Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder</i> (the 
title of the English version of the book loses the flavor of the original French 
title, which can be literally rendered as <i>Leftism, the Remedy for the 
Infantile Disorder of Communism</i>), but Hermann Gorter&#8217;s response remained 
almost totally unknown. Furthermore, just as current opinion holds that the 
refusal of the German Communist Party in 1930 to enter an alliance with social 
democracy was one of the principal causes of Hitler&#8217;s rise to power, similarly 
the lively antiparliamentarism of the years 1918-1923 arouses distrust.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Even the basic history of the period 1917-1921 (without focusing 
on the &#8220;leftists&#8221;) in Germany remains barely accessible. Taking just France into 
account (and the situation is no more brilliant elsewhere), at the time when we 
began putting this book together, only one Parisian bookstore was selling the 
last copies of <i>The Revolution in Germany</i> by the Trotskyist P. Broué 
(1973).</p>

<p class="fst">The avatars of the little world of publishing reflect, in their 
own way, the tectonic shifts of &#8220;real&#8221; history. After decades of oblivion, it 
required the social disturbances of the sixties and a renascence of workers 
self-organization and the critique of bureaucracy to reawaken interest in 
council communism (reflected in the Situationist International) and to create 
the need to once again take up the thread of time.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h2">Towards the Unitary Organization</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The fact that, at the beginning of the 21<sup style="font-size: 80%">st</sup> century, 
the basic accusations hurled at the world in 1919 are still current is nothing 
to be proud of: it means that the world has not changed basically since 1919. 
Far from it: the rule of capital is more deeply entrenched and has assumed a 
planetary scale. Even when the outward appearance has changed, the structures of 
capitalist society, such as the State, parliament, and the trade unions, have 
remained and preserve their essential functions. The great practical and 
theoretical merit of the German revolutionaries was that they counted parliament 
and the trade unions among their adversaries, at a time when these institutions 
had until then been the very structure of the workers movement in the advanced 
capitalist countries.</p>

<p class="fst">The repudiation of the trade unions in 1919 in Germany was not 
mere rhetoric, but reality. Not a renunciation, but an act of creation. <i>&#8220;Get 
out of the trade unions&#8221;</i> expressed the real activity of hundreds of 
thousands of workers who abandoned them to form unitary organizations, the <i>
unionen</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">&#8220;Union&#8221; must be understood here in its two meanings: the reunion 
of the proletarians, but also the single organization, combining economic and 
political functions. It did not involve the resurgence of a more or less 
Proudhonian &#8220;economism&#8221;, concerned above all with managing the workshop in a 
different way, and then the factory and finally the whole industry. In the fall 
of 1919, the AAU of Bremen declared that it was not a trade union, not even a 
&#8220;revolutionary syndicalist&#8221; type of trade union, and that it was fighting for 
political power.</p>

<p class="fst">Unionism was the tendency to break down all trade barriers: when 
workers abandoned their trade unions, they did so by entire factories, rather 
than by this or that trade. It also signified the will to organize beyond the 
boundaries of each industry: the unions operated on the scale of whole economic 
regions.</p>

<p class="fst">In a negative sense, unionism is a reaction against the 
institutions which accepted the war, collaborated with the Sacred Union in order 
to increase production, and then broke the wartime strikes. In a positive sense, 
it was solidarity, a community of action. Workerism? The criterion for 
membership in the AAUD was to declare that one is favor of the dictatorship of 
the proletariat. A worker in favor of sectional struggles by trade category 
would not have been admitted. Unionism does not reduce the proletarian to a 
producer.</p>

<p class="fst">In practice, and especially in Hamburg and Bremen, where this 
tendency was most vigorous, the communists attacked the trade union offices and 
distributed the contents of the trade union treasuries to the unemployed, and 
the rank and file members of the trade union did nothing to defend an 
institution which they no longer considered to be theirs. This tendency would 
persist in the KPD even after the purge of its leftists. In 1919, the Heidelberg 
Congress, which excluded the left, still did not preclude the possibility that 
&#8220;if it becomes necessary&#8221;, &#8220;the destruction of the trade union form and [...] 
the creation of new forms of organization&#8221;<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> would be undertaken.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h3">Antiparliamentarism</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Here, too, we are not confronted by a merely theoretical 
position, but by the systematization of concrete experience. In 1919, the 
electoral mechanism, in the Constituent Assembly as well as in the official 
councils dominated by the social democracy, was revealed to be an obstacle to 
the revolutionary dynamic. If in 1916 Pannekoek did not exclude the subversive 
use of parliament,<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> events would later clarify democracy&#8217;s function: 
&#8220;Universal suffrage has been ... a sign that the bourgeoisie has defeated the 
working class&#8221;, Johann Knief maintained in January 1919.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">At its founding congress (December 30, 1918 to January 1, 1919), 
the KPD voted 62 to 23 against participation in the elections to the Constituent 
Assembly. To Rosa Luxemburg, advocate of utilizing a tribune even though she 
rejected it, those who would still comprise the party majority for a few more 
months retorted: elections and electoral institutions are some of the most 
effective ways to detour revolutionary energy, and to drown the radical minority 
under the opinions of proletarians who are still under social democratic 
influence. The only way to free them from that influence is action in the 
factory and the streets, not the utilization of an institution which is alien to 
the revolutionaries and in which they will always be sure to end up losing, no 
matter how many delegates they elect.</p>

<p class="fst">The problem became more complicated when parliamentarism ceased 
to operate solely in a visibly &#8220;bourgeois&#8221; arena, but also within the forms 
which the social movement against the war assumed. In the same article cited 
above, J. Knief asserts: &#8220;The soldiers councils, which were originally class 
institutions of the proletariat, have become institutions of bourgeois 
democracy... The same thing is happening to the workers councils.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">In fact, in December 1918, the communists were a tiny minority at 
the Reich Congress of Workers and Soldiers Councils, and neither Liebknecht nor 
Luxemburg was allowed to be listed as a candidate ... because they were not 
registered with an economic enterprise! Dozens, hundreds of salaried bureaucrats 
took their seats as <i>workers</i> in an assembly from which incontestable 
representatives and defenders of labor were excluded. This was neither the first 
nor the last time workerism was used for an anti-working class purpose.</p>

<p class="fst">We must point out that many people at that time, including some 
on the communist left, still conceived of anti-parliamentarism as a tactical and 
non-essential position. In 1919, Pannekoek thought that although parliament 
could no longer be the instrument of either revolution or the administration of 
the future society, it was not out of the question that it could be used in a 
pre-revolutionary period.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1919, however, participation in the elections was rejected by 
a considerable number of those who would later become well-known figures in the 
KPD, such as Paul Frölich and W. Münzenberg, who were at that time &#8220;Leftists&#8221;, 
at least in regard to this essential point.</p>

<p class="fst">It was not the parliamentary road to socialism that was in 
question, since all the KPD&#8217;s militants of that period saw the soviets or 
councils, and not parliament, as the political form of the revolution. In 
1919-1920 the debate revolved around the possible use of bourgeois democracy <i>
before</i> the revolution. In the years prior to 1914, the left wing within the 
Second International attacked <i>Nur-Parlementarismus</i> (&#8220;Parliament Alone&#8221;), 
the idea, and its practical application, according to which the bourgeois 
electoral mechanism would be sufficient for the socialist transformation. For 
the left, what were also required (above all) were the strike and mass 
mobilizations in the streets, without rejecting the established representative 
institutions in principle. This was just what the left communists rejected in 
1919: the tactical use, even for propaganda, even as a tribune, of bourgeois 
democracy.</p>

<p class="fst">Bordiga, for his part, declared that he was always opposed to 
systematic abstentionism, which was of anarchist inspiration, according to him. 
Nonetheless, the future founders of the Communist Party of Italy proclaimed &#8220;the 
incompatibility of communist principles and methods with participation in 
elections to bourgeois representative bodies.&#8221;<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> His abstentionism was 
therefore not only bound to the circumstances of 1919, and was indeed very close 
to a rejection &#8220;in principle&#8221;. By calling themselves the &#8220;Abstentionist 
Fraction&#8221;, they clearly demonstrated the essential importance which they granted 
to this question.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As it turned out, post-1918 Germany deprived the distinction 
between &#8220;tactical&#8221; and &#8220;principled&#8221; anti-parliamentarism of any meaning: endemic 
rebellion, assassinations, pro- and anti-revolutionary armed gangs, reactionary 
conspiracies, preparations for <i>coups d&#8217;État</i> (from the Kapp Putsch in 1920 
to the 1923 Munich coup attempt in which Hitler participated), etc. Even 
disregarding the assassinations of many revolutionary militants and cadres, 
crime became a part of political life: the assassinations of Haase, the USPD 
leader (1919), of Erzberger, leader of the <i>Zentrum</i>, the moderate Catholic 
party, and Foreign Minister (1921), of Rathenau, a leading liberal 
industrialist, and also Foreign Minister (1922). All of these assassinations 
constituted efforts to eliminate the center, which comprises the pivot of every 
democracy. Fighting for revolution in such circumstances rules out having any 
illusions about or participating in a parliamentary democracy which functioned 
in such a defective manner. From a broader perspective, however, those 
individuals were rare who, like Otto Rühle, looking forward beyond those 
turbulent years, proclaimed the definitive end of an era, and declared 
parliamentarism, whether feasible or not, as well as trade unionism, whether 
effective or not, to be henceforth inherent characteristics of the functioning 
of capitalist society.</p>

<p class="fst">In his critique of the Dutch Communist Party (written in the 
summer of 1919), Gorter showed how democracy strengthens capital.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> While it is 
true that council communism enthusiastically contrasts &#8220;workers&#8221; democracy to 
the &#8220;bourgeois&#8221; variety, it is also clear that it fully grasped the role of the 
latter, as would be further demonstrated ten years later, after Mussolini had 
come to power and the Nazis were mobilizing huge crowds. We offer two quotations 
from among the dozens available:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Democracy is being fascistized, it is calmly making alliances 
with the dictatorships; and the dictatorships are covering themselves with a 
democratic cloak.&#8221; (1931)</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Fascism is not opposed to bourgeois democracy; to the contrary, 
it is its continuation by other means.&#8221; (1932)<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">For the council communists, the social democrats and the 
Stalinists helped the Nazis take power not by refusing to unite, but by uniting 
against the revolution. In 1933, Hitler only completed the counterrevolution 
begun by the SPD in 1919 and acquiesced in by the KPD over the following years, 
due to the social democracy of its origins and its unconditional defense of the 
Russian State.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2><a name="h4">The Workers Revolution</a></h2>

<p class="fst">The addition of the word &#8220;workers&#8221; in the KAPD&#8217;s name (<i>Kommunistische 
Arbeiter Partei Deutschlands</i>) signaled the intention to found a party upon 
the basis of its rank and file, and was an appeal to self-organization.</p>

<p class="fst">It was an affirmation of <i>class</i>: the workers versus the 
rest of society. As Gorter emphasized, the workers stand alone. Not only must 
the factory workers prevail over the other classes, but &#8220;the obligation to work 
must be implacably enforced&#8221; (Program of the KAPD, Section II.8), which, under 
the prevailing conditions of that era, would have amounted to the widest 
possible extension of blue-collar type work.</p>

<p class="fst">Such insistence may seem surprising. Let us consider the 
situation of a schoolteacher who is disgusted by the butchery of 1914-1918, 
aware of the death of ideals in the trenches, of the collapse of political 
structures, and who is looking for solutions. How could he follow the 
revolutionaries, whose program appeared to imply sending his son, and perhaps 
even his wife, into the factory? This is what communism promised him: a 
proletarian fate, which appeared to him to be the least enviable of all possible 
fates. In short, instead of proclaiming the need to supersede the proletarian 
condition, the KAPD program sought to generalize it. Is this not an excellent 
way to turn the petit-bourgeoisie against the workers, and to push them into the 
arms of the parties of order, if not into the arms of the Freikorps...?</p>

<p class="fst">Posing the question in this manner is anachronistic. By doing so, 
one overlooks the fear and the scorn, if not the class hatred, for the factory 
workers which were then characteristic of tradesmen, shopkeepers, officials and 
members of the liberal professions. The <i>workers</i> revolution was then 
presented as the only historically possible kind of revolution. Only with the 
benefit of being able to look back at history are we now capable of 
understanding how Gorter and the KAPD went so far theorizing a state of affairs 
which in no way depended upon them, and therefore reinforced, contrary to their 
own intentions, the obstacles to the revolution they were trying to bring about. 
The class hatred of the petit-bourgeoisie grew more acute as they contemplated 
their &#8220;demotion&#8221; to the status of manual workers.</p>

<p class="fst">Hence the insistence on &#8220;the worker&#8221;:</p>

<p class="fst">&#8220;The worker is a proletarian in the Marxist sense only in 
production, in his role as a wage worker.&#8221; Outside the factory, &#8220;he lives, acts, 
and feels like a petit-bourgeois,&#8221; wrote Rühle.</p>

<p class="fst">And Gorter wrote, in 1921: &#8220;In the factories, the proletarian 
means something. There he is a fighter because he is a worker. There he can 
exist as a free man... There, since the revolution comes from the factories, he 
can fight ... with weapons in hand.&#8221;<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is true that other texts called for an infinitely more 
expansive notion of emancipation. The communist left was not closed to the 
multifarious aspirations which coursed through Germany prior to 1914, which were 
reinforced by the social collapse provoked by the war: rejection of mechanical 
and commercial civilization, flight from the cities, the beginnings of a 
non-antagonistic relation to nature, the search for another way of living, of 
eating, of loving, for a poetry &#8220;made by all&#8221;... The activities and 
personalities of the diverse range of people who opted for council communism 
testify to this surpassing of the domain of the worker.</p>

<p class="fst">The same Rühle whom we have just seen theorizing workerism, posed 
the need to go beyond all cultural values and practices. Against the social 
democracy (which was soon to be imitated in this respect by Stalinism), which 
presented itself as the continuator of the &#8220;good&#8221; conquests of bourgeois 
civilization, he said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The bourgeoisie has bequeathed an evil legacy to the ascendant 
social class, the proletariat. In the domain of culture, the proletariat faces 
an essential task. It must have the courage to reject all bourgeois concepts 
relating to culture, morality, ethics and esthetics.&#8221;<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Schwab, a former <i>Wandervögel</i> (&#8220;migratory bird&#8221;; one who 
embraces a back-to-nature lifestyle), would later devote himself to 
architecture. In Germany and in Holland, non-conformist and dissident artists 
like H. Roland-Holst, Gorter and F. Jung played a pioneering role. It was not by 
chance that F. Pfempfert, a leading figure in Expressionism, made his famous 
journal <i>Die Aktion</i> a focal point for the revolutionary movement. We could 
even cite Traven, and his broadsheet <i>Der Zeigelbrenner</i> (the 
Brick-burner), which, in December 1918, was distributed by the thousands in the 
streets of Munich with a lead article entitled <i>The World Revolution Begins</i>.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> 
(Traven was to go on to participate in the Bavarian Council Republic and would 
narrowly escape execution). Such trends, of course, indicate a degree of 
openness to other demands distinct from self-management of production, however 
radical this self-management may be.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1920, the German group known as the Dadaist Revolutionary 
Central Council put the following demands in the first lines of its program: the 
end of property, the suppression of labor by mechanization, a new urbanism, and 
the fusion of art and life. The <i>Manifesto of Proletarian Art</i> declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The proletariat is a condition which must be overcome. The 
bourgeoisie is a condition which must be overcome.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">We shall add this precocious note of lucidity seldom encountered 
at that time:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The bourgeoisie is using the communist apparatus, which is not 
an invention of the proletariat but of the bourgeoisie, to help renovate its 
decomposing culture (Russia).&#8221;<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Such claims, however, remained implicit and occupied the margins 
of the movement &#8220;which transforms the conditions of existence&#8221;, that is, of the 
masses in their struggle in the factories and the streets. For the revolutionary 
organizations, even the artists who had joined the proletariat were still a 
little too &#8220;artistic&#8221;, and their esthetic too advanced. And in the eyes of the 
vanguard artists, the most radical of the workers were still a little 
&#8220;bourgeois&#8221; in their esthetic preferences. If Gorter was a poet, he was a poet <i>
outside</i> of his theoretical texts, in which there is little evidence of 
poetic creation. (It is in Otto Rühle where theory attempts a new kind of 
writing, as in <i>The Revolution is Not a Party Matter.</i>) Separation reigns. 
Everything which is presented as positive, everything positive which is done, 
finally revolves around work. The aspiration for other ways of life transmitted 
a subterranean impulse to the movement, but could not assert itself in that 
movement, and did not transcend the &#8220;workers&#8221; character of the movement&#8217;s 
activities and program.</p>

<p class="fst">It was certainly true that, on occasion, it was thought that the 
Council would go beyond workerism, integrating &#8220;all those who must be considered 
as proletarians, the street vendor or the teacher as well as the artist or the 
white collar employee&#8221;. (K. Schröder, <i>On the Future of the New Society</i>, 
1920).</p>

<p class="fst">By enrolling these categories, Schröder explains, the General 
Workers Unions will unite them with the factory workers. This position is all 
the more significant in that it comes from the principal leader of the KAPD. But 
this perspective thereby universalizes a proletarian condition which it does not 
suppress, and is limited to the sphere of labor: society is a society of 
production, and the proletarians are producers. The critique of work as a 
separate activity (which presupposes an entirely different vision of society and 
of human life) does not emerge as a specific point, and even less as an 
essential one.</p>

<p class="fst">This &#8220;class against class&#8221; position does not perceive that the 
social classes and, first of all, the two fundamental ones, the bourgeoisie and 
the proletariat, are complementary moments, forms and functions of the 
reproduction of capital, and that the mere fact of having based a mode of 
activity, and of having theorized the most radical activities of the time based 
upon these categories, indicates the limit of this perspective: one remains 
within capitalism if one clings to the class struggle without going any further.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The German communist left was the left current which best 
understood the nature of the <i>mediations</i> standing between the proletarians 
and their emancipation, mediations which go by the names of parliament, trade 
union, and political party, and it fought them. But here we come upon the 
paradox. Gorter, undoubtedly the most &#8220;workerist&#8221; German left communist, quite 
correctly included the reformism of the <i>worker</i> himself among the enemies 
of communism. Not illogically, in 1923 he would count among the enemies of 
communism ... almost all the world&#8217;s workers.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> In fact, at the end of 1918, 
the workers who were most firmly rooted in the world of labor, the revolutionary 
shop stewards (especially among Berlin&#8217;s metal workers) refused to join the 
newborn Communist Party, preferring to remain instead within the &#8220;centrist&#8221; 
party, the USPD, which emerged from a split within the SPD in 1917. They would 
later join the Unified Communist Party (VKPD), without ever connecting with the 
council communists.</p>

<p class="fst">In addition, it was among those workers rather than among the 
communist left where the <i>dream of self-management</i> appears to have been 
most deeply-rooted, embraced by the workers in the skilled trades who still 
fulfilled an indispensable function in the organization of production during 
those pre-Fordist times, workers who were conscious of their specialist skills, 
and who possessed a highly-developed sense of their value and their role in the 
enterprise, a role played along with the technicians and engineers, but in 
rivalry with the latter.</p>

<p class="fst">The strength of the USPD, the amalgamation of the Kautskyist old 
guard and authentic working-class cadres, resided in the fact that it 
represented a certain kind of labor autonomy within the parliamentary republic 
born in November 1918. Its implicit program involved transforming the 
institutionalized workers councils into counter-powers capable of improving the 
living conditions of the workers by gaining a preponderant influence within 
bourgeois democracy, even (in the most extreme conception) going so far as to 
convert the bourgeois democracy into a labor democracy. The fact that this 
aspiration was quickly shown to be groundless by the ensuing events is evident. 
In 1917-1921, however, this did not prevent these ideas from holding sway over a 
significant part of the German working class.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD therefore situated the revolutionary wellspring (and the 
guarantee against possible deviations) in a profound working-class nature whose 
emblematic figure (the metal worker) slipped from their grasp. Gorter came close 
to an understanding of this paradox, but did not succeed in doing so. One cannot 
fight except on the basis of one&#8217;s own situation, but when one&#8217;s struggle rests <i>
solely</i> on one&#8217;s situation, one furthers its development without surpassing 
it. The KAPD delegates to the Third Congress of the International emphasized the 
power of capital, which was not only capable of absorbing what the proletarians 
create (trade unions) and utilize (elections) but was also capable of absorbing 
their demands (reforms). After 1921, during the phase of reflux, some KAPists 
would question the pertinence of all wage struggles, calling upon the <i>unionen</i>, 
soon to be drained of most of their members, to restrict their activities to 
revolutionary action.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<h2><a name="h5">The National-Bolshevik Aberration and its Meaning</a></h2>

<p class="fst">It is most unfortunate that the only people who tried to find 
social means to go beyond workerism did so from a national basis.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1915, in <i>Democracy and Organization</i>, Laufenberg and 
Wolffheim explained that the bourgeois State could be neither national nor 
democratic: only the proletariat would create a &#8220;pan-German&#8221; republic, that is, 
it would unite the various German-speaking countries (the voluntary merger of 
Austria and Germany was, let us recall, a classic watchword of social 
democracy). For this reason they advocated progressive action: it was not by the 
classical socialist road (parliament) that an economic democracy could be built, 
but by the councils which administer vast industrial associations. They thus 
defended the councils for very different reasons than Pannekoek and Rühle. For 
Laufenberg and Wolffheim, the councils were the instruments of a transition 
which would not necessarily be violent thanks to the control exercised over all 
levels of society by the workers.</p>

<p class="fst">But the labor which they wanted to incorporate into the councils 
was by no means the same labor intended by Gorter: beyond the walls of the 
factory, it included all the trades and professions which take part in the 
production of wealth and, ultimately, almost the entire population, the body of 
which forms what they called <i>the people</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The anticapitalism of Wolffheim and Laufenberg was soon (at least 
as of 1915) set upon a national foundation. Their classless society is the 
national totality. The fact that, after the war, they formed alliances with 
reactionaries was a logical, although not inevitable, consequence of this view. 
To want to create a classless society before the end of classes is, necessarily, 
to organize <i>this</i> society from above by smothering the class 
contradictions within it.<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Wolffheim and Laufenberg are of course to be numbered among the 
promoters of the councils, but in their view the councils were a means to 
organize a fusion of classes led by the proletariat in alliance with social 
groups which are allegedly anti-bourgeois due to their pre-capitalist 
characteristics, especially the in the army. In this manner they invented a <i>
non</i>-revolutionary councilism.</p>

<p class="fst">Unlike the communist left, but fully within the social democratic 
tradition, Wolffheim and Laufenberg renounced the critique and destruction of 
the State. The State, Laufenberg wrote, has two functions: one of exploitation, 
the other being the framework necessary for the life of the community, and what 
needs to be done is to make the second role prevail over the first. Bernstein 
and revisionism had been saying the same thing.</p>

<p class="fst">Wolffheim and Laufenberg advocate a peaceful road to a socialism 
that would be national.</p>

<p class="fst">Nor were they the first to want to rouse the nation against a 
supposedly weakened and discredited bourgeoisie that was ready to sell its 
population to international capitalism. From then on their goal was to forge a 
popular alliance, which would in turn join an alliance with Russia in a 
revolutionary war against France, England and the United States, countries which 
had been equated with the real heart of world capitalism, that is, the banks, 
whose representative within world communism was Paul Levi (former Spartacist, 
leader of the Communist Party and the incarnation of anti-leftism), &#8220;agent of 
international Jewish finance&#8221;. All their uses of anti-semitism (even though it 
was not a central issue for them as it was for the Nazis) and all their contacts 
with reactionaries (which the two Hamburg militants were soon to make) were 
enough to drive them far from the proletarian movement and even into the arms of 
their declared adversaries. The enemies of our enemies are not our friends. 
Nonetheless, we may observe that the strategy of Laufenberg and Wolffheim 
prefigured those strategies which would later launch numerous anti-imperialist 
national fronts in the Third World, with the intermittent support of western 
progressives. We lose count of the &#8220;communist&#8221; parties in Africa or Asia which 
formed alliances with the military (no matter how murderous) in the name of the 
construction of national socialism.</p>

<p class="fst">National Bolshevism never &#8220;took root&#8221; in the KAPD as a whole: its 
audience remained restricted to Hamburg and, to a much lesser extent, to 
Frankfurt. Nonetheless, even on this small scale, this new marriage of the 
nation and the proletariat (which had finalized their divorce in the blood and 
filth of 1914-1918) is certainly one of the monstrosities produced by an era 
that was not short on monstrosities.</p>

<p class="fst">It would fall to the Nazis to reap the fruits of this 
perspective, in a very different way. The community of proletarian labor 
solidarity advocated by the KAPD had failed. The National-Bolshevik popular 
community of the producers was stillborn. A racial-national community would 
prevail after 1933.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<p class="sub">*<br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="fst">Our selection of texts begins with the description of the prosaic 
activities of a workers council and concludes with the founding of a new 
International doomed to failure. The full range of the movement&#8217;s activities is 
embraced in this selection. The revolutionaries do not need to be glorified.</p>

<p class="fst">On the other hand, nothing would be more false than to reduce the 
movement featured in this book to &#8220;Revolution or Nothing!&#8221; Precisely because, in 
1919-1920, Pannekoek perceived the revolutionary process, despite all 
appearances, to be a long-term undertaking&#8212;and today we know that he was not 
mistaken&#8212;only activity faithful to a minimum of principles was capable in his 
eyes of contributing to that movement. For this reason in particular he 
mistrusted the faith in a small party which was to radicalize the masses.</p>

<p class="fst">There is no lack of contradictions among the texts we publish 
here, and it is tempting to pin labels on them, which would in some cases be 
deserved: &#8220;activism&#8221;, &#8220;workerism&#8221;, &#8220;anti-parliamentarism&#8221; ... so many real 
tendencies whose vigorous emergence was not the result so much of a current of 
ideas as they were brought about by two or three crucial years of the century. 
The German communist left did not practice &#8220;politics&#8221; and did not seek a mass 
&#8220;base&#8221; by making demands on its behalf. It is undoubtedly for this reason that 
it has been forgotten by official history and, though only later, became a 
collection of groupuscules. Its supersession presupposes nothing less than 
another course of history. Its continuation therefore remains to be imagined and 
lived...</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n8" href="#fn8">[8]</a> Every reader of <i>Left-Wing Communism</i> knows that Lenin 
gave the German Left a good hiding and treated the &#8220;Italian&#8221; Left with kid 
gloves. Forty years later, in <i>&#8220;The Infantile Disorder&#8221;, a Condemnation of 
Future Renegades</i> (available from the International Communist Party), Amadeo 
Bordiga would take pains not to see what he had in common with the German Left, 
and how he differed from Lenin. Here, for instance, is how his journal, <i>Il 
Soviet</i> (Naples), announced its publication in 1920 of Pannekoek&#8217;s text <i>
The World Revolution and Communist Tactics</i> (see <i>Pannekoek and Gorter&#8217;s 
Marxism</i>, ed. and tr. by D. A. Smart, Pluto Press, London, 1978, for an 
English translation which includes Pannekoek&#8217;s April 1920 &#8220;Afterword&#8221;):</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">&#8220;As is known, comrade Lenin, in his admirable activity, has finally found time to devote himself, in a special pamphlet written on the eve of the Moscow Congress, to the radical movement within international communism, defining it as an infantile disorder of communism. In this pamphlet our infantilism, along with our journal, are the objects of particular attention and we have resigned ourselves, after having endured father&#8217;s whip, to patiently bear the gibes of our dear brothers at home, which shall not fail to be heard.&#8221;</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">&#8220;But just as impertinent children who have been punished never 
lack a protective uncle who consoles them with some candy, we also have received 
some candy in the form of a long article&#8212;which shall in turn be published as a 
pamphlet&#8212;published under the title given below, by comrade Pannekoek, in No. 
28-29 of <i>Kommunismus</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">&#8220;We think it is fitting to recall that in 1912 Pannekoek, before Lenin, clearly asserted what has since become the touchstone of international communism: the destruction of the parliamentary-democratic State as the first task of the proletarian revolution. We also recall that a competent and unimpeachable witness, Karl Radek, has defined Pannekoek as <i>the most perceptive mind of international socialism</i>.&#8221; (Quoted in <i>(Dis)Continuité</i>, No. 7, 1999, p. 46).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n12" href="#fn12">[12]</a> <i>Die Aktion</i>, September 4, 1920. Years later, his <i>
Psychology of the Proletarian Child</i> (1925) echoed a demand which cropped up 
throughout this whole period: to think and to organize for oneself, against the 
established authority, against the designated or self-proclaimed leader, in the 
world of work as in politics, but also in the family and the school. Rühle 
expresses a will to autonomy, and the rejection of institutional power 
(especially among the youth). &#8220;Society must be the community, and the community 
is the opposite pole of domination, of authority and of violence. By keeping 
authority at the greatest possible distance is the way one gets closer to 
socialism.&#8221; Theorizing the rank and file against the leaders, self-organization 
against hierarchy, announcing a rebellion of the youth, Rühle here anticipates 
the themes which would constitute the strength as well as the weakness of the 
revolts which would break out forty or fifty years later.</p>

The next revolutionary crisis, which could spell the judgment day of the world which you then (and later) confronted, will vindicate the entire truth of dadaism.&#8221; (Debord, <i>Correspondance</i>, Fayard, Vol. III, 2003.
