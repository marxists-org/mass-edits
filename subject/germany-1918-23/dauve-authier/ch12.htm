<h3><a name="h1">The Coup d&#8217;État and the First Instances of &#8220;Workers Government&#8221; and 
&#8220;Anti-Fascism&#8221;</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The Kapp Putsch (May 13-17, 1920) was an attempt on the part of 
reactionary elements in the Army to take the first steps towards building a 
strong right-wing government. The German Army (<i>Reichswehr</i>) was 
reestablished by the constituent assembly: by June 1919 it had 100,000 men, the 
maximum allowed by the postwar treaties. Including the <i>Freikorps</i>, 
however, by the beginning of 1920 the Army had 400,000 men, which provoked the 
protests of the victorious powers.</p>

<p class="fst">The <i>Freikorps</i> arose during the period of military 
demobilization and State disintegration, and their only purpose was to serve as 
an instrument of the counterrevolution in Germany and Russia. They were paid by 
the State. As the situation appeared to have stabilized, the government solved 
part of its problem in September 1919 by prohibiting the creation of local 
militias, while directly transforming numerous <i>Freikorps</i> units into <i>
Reichswehr</i> detachments. But it could not integrate all of them, as it wanted 
to provide the army with a republican &#8220;varnish&#8221;. The majority of the troops who 
would participate in the Kapp Putsch were from <i>Freikorps</i> units which had 
returned from Russia after having participated in the foreign intervention. They 
feared they would be discharged due to the terms of the Versailles Treaty. A 
right-wing faction, encouraged by Kapp, a senior Prussian official, established 
contacts with their commanders in order to carry out a political operation.</p>

<p class="fst">Discovering that 6,000 men under the command of Lüttwitz (one of 
Noske&#8217;s direct subordinates in January 1919) were going to occupy Berlin on 
March 13, the socialist government fled to Dresden and then to Stuttgart. 
Ludendorff, who supported the <i>Freikorps</i>, installed himself in the 
Chancellery in order to establish a &#8220;dignified government&#8221;. Despite the 
socialist government&#8217;s flight, the Kapp regime fell after four days due to a 
general strike called by all the parties, except for the rightist KPD. Reacting 
against &#8220;leftism&#8221;, it had moved in the opposite direction, becoming hostile to 
any and all action: the KPD delegates would admit this at the Third World 
Congress, along with other &#8220;errors&#8221;. Levi had not expected the &#8220;crisis&#8221; to break 
out until 1926. The (excluded) left, however, issued a proclamation calling for 
the formation of a red army and for an insurrection. The Communist International 
would reproach the KAPD for having demonstrated its thoughtlessness by 
prematurely opening &#8220;recruiting offices&#8221; for a red army.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> In its discussion of 
the battles in the Ruhr (cf. below), the Communist International declared that 
&#8220;the party must know how to call off the struggle at the precise moment when its 
continuation would be likely to lead to military or political defeat&#8221;. The 
accusations of &#8220;leftism&#8221; and adventurism were based on this kind of criticism: 
they would stand in stark contrast to the facts.</p>

<p class="fst">Despite Kapp&#8217;s declaration that &#8220;all those who do not report to 
work will be shot&#8221;, there is no doubt that there has never been such an 
absolutely effective general strike in all of history. The bourgeois parties, 
which had been very prudent since the end of the war, did not support the 
conspirators. The Bank of Germany refused to grant Kapp the 10 billion marks 
needed for government operations. Unable to even find a press which would 
publish his proclamations, Kapp fled to Switzerland. The episode of the Kapp 
Putsch did, however, leave 3,000 victims in its wake. Prior to the coup d&#8217;état, 
the <i>Freikorps</i> carried out various outrages, such as burning down the 
Leipzig Peoples&#8217; Hall, killing three hundred people. There were also pitched 
battles throughout the rest of Saxony, in Thuringia, and especially in the Ruhr.</p>

<p class="fst">The coup was totally successful only in Bavaria. The Hoffmann 
ministry&#8212;the Bavarian Ebert (cf. Chapter 7)&#8212;was overthrown: the diet was 
replaced by a right wing ministry led by von Kahr. The central government 
returned to Berlin, where it hastened to call an end to the strike and disarm 
the workers. The strike committee, however, under the leadership of Legien, who 
was undoubtedly using the rank and file&#8217;s militancy to bolster his position in 
his personal rivalry with the leaders of the SPD, attempted to form a &#8220;workers 
government&#8221;. The communists of the KPD, &#8220;prisoners of their leftism&#8221;,<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> 
distrusted this government almost as much as Noske&#8217;s government. This &#8220;workers 
government&#8221; was to be composed of the SPD, the USPD and the KPD, along with the 
trade unions.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> The USPD rejected the proposal in order to preserve its leftist 
reputation: its own left wing had grown since December 1919 under Däumig&#8217;s 
leadership. The representatives of the KPD (among others, Pieck)<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> accepted 
the proposal and later had their authority to negotiate revoked by the KPD 
leadership.</p>

<p class="fst">The KPD, however, later declared its support for a policy of 
&#8220;loyal opposition&#8221;, defined as &#8220;the renunciation of preparations for any violent 
action&#8221; against a socialist government. Since the proletarian dictatorship was 
impossible, it was necessary to create &#8220;a situation in which bourgeois democracy 
cannot act as the dictatorship of capital&#8221;.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> A perfect definition of <i>
anti-fascism</i>: preventing capitalist democracy from becoming a capitalist 
dictatorship, <i>without</i> revolutionary action, of course. The entire party 
(including Levi, who had just been released from prison) was outraged by this 
proposal. A short time later, however, Levi resuscitated the same theme with his 
suggestion of a possible gradual transformation of the bourgeois republic into a 
soviet republic. It was thus in Germany that the slogan of a &#8220;purely working 
class&#8221; government, that is, one composed of parties which &#8220;represent&#8221; the 
working class, first arose. Everything which the Communist International would 
impose upon the young Communist Parties came from Europe: the united front, for 
example, and the Spartacist tactic of &#8220;conquering the majority&#8221;, and the idea of 
the majority of the workers acquiring socialist consciousness <i>before</i> the 
revolution; or the cult of the worker, combined with bolshevization after 
1924-1925 (factory cell organization). At the KAPD&#8217;s Congress, one delegate&#8217;s 
assertion that &#8220;here, there are no intellectuals, there are only workers&#8221;, was 
greeted with a burst of &#8220;lively applause&#8221; according to the official minutes. The 
same is true of anti-fascism. Germany, the most modern country, not from the 
point of view of technology but from that of the development of the class 
struggle (on both sides) and of the forms of capitalist rule, was the cradle of 
all the essential weapons of the counterrevolution which still plague the 
proletariat so many decades later.</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin criticized the right-wing leadership of the KPD in his <i>
Infantile Disorder</i>: the formula of &#8220;loyal opposition to a government 
composed solely of socialists&#8221; is not correct because a government composed of 
&#8220;social traitors&#8221; cannot be called &#8220;socialist&#8221;. Otherwise, this was a good 
example of a &#8220;Bolshevik-style compromise&#8221;.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> The left, faced with this policy 
of the central committee, drew the opposite conclusion, and realized that it had 
no interest whatsoever in availing itself of its rights within the party. 
Understanding that an abyss separated it from the KPD and that any discussion 
was superfluous, it founded the KAPD in early April (cf. Chapter 14).</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">The Red Army of the Ruhr</a></h3>

<p class="fst">During this period, the Ruhr was the stronghold of the revolution 
in Germany. It was there that the influence of the Left and of the revolutionary 
trade unions was strongest. But no one group was strong enough to unleash a 
movement on its own, and the insurrection was a spontaneous offensive of the 
proletariat (it was the first and next-to-last proletarian offensive during the 
German revolution until March 1921). At the time of the Kapp Putsch, &#8220;numerous 
regions such as the Ruhr and central Germany had not yet undergone the great 
defeats suffered by the workers during the previous years...&#8221;<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> Instead, the 
organization of the revolutionary movement in the Ruhr had suffered from the 
split in the KPD, so the <i>unionen</i> were not well-established there and 
their weakness worked to the advantage of the anarchosyndicalists, who were 
opposed to political action, which, by definition, they identified with anything 
which transcended the framework of the workplace. The General Union of Miners 
had, however, organized one-third of the Ruhr miners, whose principle region, 
Rhineland-Westphalia, was a <i>union</i> bastion. The USPD&#8217;s split and its lack 
of interest in the <i>unionen</i> facilitated the growth of anarchosyndicalist 
influence.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The military and <i>Freikorps</i> troops stationed in the Ruhr 
did not oppose Kapp and some even supported him. It was the general uncertainty 
concerning the real position of the Army which caused the most concern, and it 
was an officer&#8217;s pro-Kapp declarations which would provide the immediate pretext 
for the insurrection. Starting on March 14, the workers attacked the Army and 
formed a &#8220;red army&#8221;, putting into practice, in a way which went far beyond its 
wildest hopes, the watchword of the Left.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The workers armed themselves on two separate occasions, 
before and after the commencement of hostilities. The workers still possessed 
arms which they had concealed at the end of the war and during the &#8220;revolution&#8221;, 
but these would comprise but a small part of their arsenal. During the first few 
days after the putsch, the workers seized weapons from the <i>Einwohnerwehren</i>, 
legal organizations created after 1918 to keep order and protect property. Its 
members served as volunteers on a part-time basis: they came from a wide range 
of professional backgrounds. The radical workers went in groups to the homes of 
the members of this auxiliary police force and by fair means or foul, and 
sometimes by fraud and deceit, they made them hand over their weapons. Thus, for 
example, in one locality, where the <i>Einwohnerwehren</i> were composed of 
peasants who had little sympathy for the workers, the proletarians went to the 
peasants and proposed that they have a meeting to discuss the issue of the 
weapons. The workers&#8217; speakers made long speeches to keep the peasants away from 
their homes as long as possible and adjourned the meeting as soon as they knew 
that all the arms had been collected. In addition, despite the obligation of 
these volunteers to take an oath swearing loyalty to the Weimar constitution, 
there were many USPD members among them.</p>

<p class="fst">Then, after the first battles, the workers seized the armories, 
munitions and equipment of the regular Army units which had surrendered or fled, 
and thus equipped themselves with all the gear necessary to field an authentic 
army. The insurrection snowballed, &#8220;liberating&#8221; all of the Ruhr, from east 
(Hagen-Dortmund) to west (Essen, Duisberg, and Düsseldorf), and then the front 
lines stabilized: the western limit was the Rhine, defended by the French.</p>

<p class="fst">The insurrection began on Monday, the 15<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, as a 
result of the convergence of two separate events: a large demonstration of armed 
workers in Hagen (convoked by the parties, especially by the USPD, it had no 
military purpose at all, and was only supposed to be a peaceful show of workers&#8217; 
power) on the one hand, and on the other, a relatively serious skirmish in 
Wetter, a small city not far from Hagen.</p>

<p class="fst">In Wetter, after the first days of the Putsch, an action 
committee had been formed by representatives of various workers parties. During 
a popular assembly, unambiguous threats having been issued against individuals 
who were &#8220;particularly hated by the working class&#8221; (Colm), the committee ordered 
that these individuals were to be arrested to protect them as well as to satisfy 
the wishes of the crowd: this was the origin of the rumor that &#8220;the council 
republic&#8221; had been proclaimed in Wetter.</p>

<p class="fst">The military commanders of the Ruhr then issued the order to 
intervene and disarm the workers at various locations in the Ruhr and especially 
those in Wetter where, on the 15<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, a company of soldiers arrived by 
train. During a discussion at the train station with the action committee and 
the mayor, the unit&#8217;s captain declared that the Army in the Ruhr supported Kapp. 
The committee then broke off all discussion; in the meantime, the workers had 
convinced 20 or 30 soldiers to desert with their arms and equipment.</p>

<p class="fst">The battle began: the soldiers were barricaded in the train 
station, while the workers took up positions in the neighboring streets. The 
armed workers from the other cities in the region, who were supposed to meet in 
Hagen, upon being informed that hostilities had broken out in Wetter, headed 
there <i>en masse</i> (despite the opposition of the workers parties) and, 
streaming into Wetter in ever greater numbers, assured the workers&#8217; victory over 
the soldiers, who were annihilated.</p>

<p class="fst">A company of regular soldiers also went to a neighboring city. 
The <i>Freikorps</i> had sought refuge in Dortmund on the 16<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, but 
on the following day this city was taken by the rebels, who seized a significant 
quantity of war <i>materiel</i>. All of the cities of the Ruhr were taken during 
the next few days. The <i>Reichswehr</i> abandoned the Ruhr; the workers 
sometimes cut off its retreat, taking numerous prisoners and hastening its 
departure.</p>

<p class="fst">The rebels came from all social layers, but there were only a few 
intellectuals among them, and most of these were teachers. On this occasion, the 
regrouping was carried out upon a totally <i>geographical</i> basis: 
neighborhood, town, city, and region. The factories did not constitute, except 
on rare occasions, the site for concentration and action. The &#8220;red army&#8221; had 
between 80,000 and 100,000 men, as well as artillery and a small air force. It 
was organized around three centers: Hagen (in the hands of the USPD), Essen (KPD 
and USPD Left) and Mülheim (revolutionary syndicalists and the KPD&#8217;s excluded 
left: the KAPD would be founded shortly afterwards). Hagen was recognized as the 
central leadership of the army: after the government&#8217;s ultimatum imposing a 
ceasefire and threatening recalcitrants with military repression, Hagen would 
announce &#8220;the quite ambiguous directive of resuming the general strike (when the 
workers were armed and engaged in battle)&#8221;.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">The Forms Assumed by Workers Power in the Ruhr</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The three &#8220;workers&#8221; parties (SPD-USPD-KPD) considered the 
workers&#8217; actions to be &#8220;adventurist&#8221; and did not accept the violent intervention 
of the proletarians except as a force in support of the jeopardized democracy. 
In Chemnitz (Saxony) where the KPD, led by the rightist Brandler, was dominant, 
the party restricted itself to arming the workers, awaiting Ebert&#8217;s return to 
power, and opposed the efforts of various groups, such as that under the command 
of Max Hölz, to arm themselves and act independently.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> Germany invented <i>
anti-fascism</i>, a policy which consists of defending capitalist democracy 
(with arms if necessary) against capitalist dictatorship, and in repressing any 
subversive tendencies which go beyond democracy, as if one led to the other; as 
if there was a &#8220;choice&#8221; between the two which would depend upon the workers.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Throughout the Ruhr, &#8220;executive committees&#8221; formed by the three 
workers parties took power. They restricted their activities to controlling, and 
sometimes purging, the existing government bodies. In most cases, they 
maintained contacts with local administrative offices.</p>

<p class="fst">In Duisberg, the KPD left deposed the tripartite executive (SPD, 
USPD, KPD) and replaced it with an &#8220;executive commission&#8221; (left KPD and FAU) 
which took power by &#8220;demagogically&#8221; (Colm) relying upon the armed workers, and 
arrested various &#8220;bonzes&#8221; from the workers parties and trade unions. These 
parties would also retaliate against the members of the Duisberg &#8220;executive 
commission&#8221; after the end of the movement, accusing them of having used the 
movement as a means of personal enrichment and characterizing them as &#8220;armed 
gangs&#8221;, &#8220;armed hordes&#8221; and &#8220;irresponsible elements&#8221;. In fact, the workers of 
Duisberg had indeed conceived of the insurrection as the beginning of the 
&#8220;second revolution&#8221;, and had requisitioned money from the banks and provisions 
from the stores and warehouses, and organized free distribution of many goods. 
But the bulk of the movement remained legalist and respected the democracy. On 
the 17<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, in Dortmund, the rebels allowed the installation of a right 
wing, SPD-USPD-KPD local government. This error would spell their downfall.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">Defeat</a></h3>

<p class="fst">On the 20<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> the trade unions declared the end of the 
strike, but the entire German side of the Ruhr was still outside the control of 
the authorities. The government and the workers parties (including the KPD) met 
in Bielefeld and on the 25<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> signed an agreement calling for the 
following: the <i>Reichswehr</i> was to stay out of the Ruhr (as the terms of 
the Versailles Treaty had stipulated, the region was to remain neutral: but the 
practical outcome was that the region was to be occupied by two armies instead 
of by one); punishment and purging of the putschists; nationalization of large 
industry. But the surrender of the workers&#8217; arms was the precondition for all of 
these concessions.</p>

<p class="fst">A large part of the red army, evidently, did not recognize the 
terms of this agreement. The members of the AAUs, the future KAPists and the 
anarchosyndicalist rank and file acted in opposition to the views of the Berlin 
central committee of the FAUD. According to Angress, the KPD&#8217;s militant groups 
formed only &#8220;an insignificant contingent compared to the anarchosyndicalist 
rebels, the unaffiliated, or the members of the KAPD, the USPD and even the 
SPD&#8221;.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> On the 30<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, the radical workers also rejected an 
ultimatum. The KPD leadership was in favor of abiding by the Bielefeld 
agreement: it was necessary to follow the SPD-USPD directives, since these two 
parties represented the majority of the workers. This stance was an indication 
of the KPD&#8217;s extreme weakness after Heidelberg.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> The workers were unmoved. 
The <i>Reichswehr</i> would no longer &#8220;keep out of the Ruhr&#8221; and, from the 3<sup style="font-size: 80%">rd</sup> 
to the 6<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> of April, easily defeated a red army weakened by 
negotiations.</p>

<p class="fst">The Ruhr insurrection and its repression had immediate 
international ramifications. The mining basin of the Ruhr provided, during that 
period, 70% of German coal production, and was of vital importance for all 
European industry, since the French mining regions were still in ruins as a 
result of the war. The interruption of coal production in the Ruhr very rapidly 
shut down economic activity in Germany, and would soon have an impact on other 
countries as well. The military occupation of the Ruhr by the <i>Reichswehr</i>, 
in order to repress the rebellion, would, of course, constitute a violation of 
the terms of the Versailles Treaty. In response, the French occupied Frankfurt, 
cutting off economic traffic between northern and southern Germany, and posing 
yet more difficulties for the German economy at the very moment when it was 
threatened by the revolutionary movement. Immediately afterwards, the English, 
aware of what was at stake (saving German capitalism and English capitalism at 
the same time) lodged a protest against the French, and, putting 
inter-capitalist solidarity above disputes over restitution, revealed the 
universal revolutionary importance of the Ruhr insurrection.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> The ensuing 
massacre would keep the Ruhr subdued until 1923.</p>

<p class="fst">The proletarians were victorious as long as they relied upon 
their social functions, utilizing the productive apparatus for supplies, arms 
and transport, without, however, remaining within the boundaries of production. 
The rebel cities united and sent help to the workers in other cities. But even 
in this respect the movement displayed its weak points, which characterized the 
whole epoch. After having emerged victorious from its clash with the Army, using 
the Army&#8217;s own methods and fighting on its own terrain, the proletarians, in 
their immense majority, thought that their job was done and handed over their 
power to the parties and the democracy. The red army expelled the military and 
then transformed itself into the classical workers movement. The workers had 
mobilized for democracy, and those who wanted to go further were mowed down by 
the same military force which had supported the anti-democratic putsch and to 
which the State rapidly turned. As the <i>Communist International</i><a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> 
recognized, there existed both a &#8220;republican guard&#8221; and a &#8220;red army&#8221; at the same 
time: formed by a coalition of organizations (SPD-USPD-KPD), the first undertook 
to preserve order and guard the stores and warehouses. As in Bavaria and 
Hungary, the workers, rather than going on the offensive, had occupied a vacuum. 
They had occupied the social space without transforming it in a communist sense.</p>

<p class="fst">The June 1920 elections legitimized the power which had been 
supported at the crucial moment by the workers. The right having reappeared on 
the political scene with the putsch, the political center of gravity moved 
rightward. The SPD relinquished power. Its electoral count fell from 12 to 6 
million. The new government was composed of a <i>centrist</i> majority, with the 
participation of &#8220;populists&#8221; (pre-war &#8220;national-liberals&#8221;), the traditional 
representatives of big capital. The USPD vote grew from 2.5 to 5 million. The 
KPD, free to practice revolutionary parliamentarism, obtained a few hundred 
thousand votes. The Communist International would do everything in its power to 
precipitate the fusion of the USPD and the KPD.</p>

<p class="fst">In order to understand the reality of the anti-parliamentary 
current among the communists, it must be seen as the expression of a real and 
numerically important movement within the proletarian masses. Even the 
adversaries of the left admitted the scale of working class abstentionism in the 
German elections. Bela Kun made the following observation concerning the 1920 
legislative elections:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is hard to precisely calculate the number of workers who have 
abstained, following the party of revolutionary confusion (the KAPD) or the 
national bolsheviks. The data from the various large cities and industrial 
regions, however, allow the assertion that abstention has by no means been 
insignificant and that many workers have expressed their revolutionary point of 
view through the boycott of the elections.&#8221;<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The same thing happened in the 
elections for the Prussian legislative assembly (at least half of Germany) in 
1921:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It can be stated that in all likelihood the majority of the 
votes lost by the USPD in the last elections <i>did not go to any other party</i>. 
The proletariat&#8217;s &#8220;electoral weariness&#8221; was a characteristic feature of the 
political situation. In Berlin, according to <i>Freiheit</i> (the USPD 
newspaper), the rate of voter participation among the bourgeoisie was between 80 
and 85%, while it was only 60 to 65% among the workers. Scheidemann and 
Hilferding interpreted this abstentionism in the same way: as a consequence of 
party disputes, of the splits caused by the communists, etc.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The abstention of such a large proportion of the proletariat, 
however, such as took place in these elections, could not be schematized by 
virtue of such simplistic formulas; the crude reality expressed by such terms as 
&#8220;electoral weariness&#8221; and &#8220;abstention&#8221; masks two phenomena. If one part of the 
abstentionist phenomenon must be understood as a symptom of the proletariat&#8217;s <i>
lack of ideological maturity</i>, the other part, on the contrary, indicates 
that a whole sector of the conscious proletariat had rejected the parliamentary 
electoral struggle, perceiving it as a phase of the revolutionary class struggle 
which had been superseded. We do not believe we are mistaken in asserting that 
the extreme exacerbation of the situation in Germany led many convinced 
communists (and not just the members of the KAPD) to accept the idea that 
participation in parliamentary activity could only be prejudicial to the 
development and maturation of revolutionary consciousness.&#8221;<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">At the beginning of August, the parliament passed a &#8220;disarmament&#8221; 
law which triggered isolated reactions from the extreme left (cf. Chapter 14). 
On this front the State would have to act slowly and with caution, despite the 
absence of any reaction on the part of the SPD and the KPD. The decision to 
seize arms stockpiles in central Germany would be the detonator of the &#8220;March 
Action&#8221; of 1921. The extreme right was assassinating leftist and even centrist 
figures. The &#8220;workers organizations&#8221; demanded that the government respect 
legality. The government would pass a law for the &#8220;protection of the <i>Reich</i>&#8221;: 
between 1920 and 1933 the law would be invoked 5 times against the right and 822 
times against the left.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a></p>
