<h3>What Is Organization?</h3>

<p class="fst">To organize means to arrange and give form to something. Parties, 
trade unions, the army, the Church, the State and the League of Nations are 
organizations.</p>

<p class="fst">What, basically, is an organization? Have they always existed in 
their current forms? The whole world knows the answer is no. Among nomadic 
peoples they were different from those of the Middle Ages, centuries later, with 
that era&#8217;s feudal guilds and serfs. Germany, then fragmented into dozens of 
principalities, duchies, free cities, etc., had a form of organization unlike 
that later assumed by the German Reich. Nor should this be surprising. The 
external forms of an epoch are not simple wrappings which can be donned and shed 
at will. So, what we must confront today, in the form of a trust or a large 
city, just like the organization of a city registrar&#8217;s office or a local 
commission for the poor, is as much connected to the <i>general situation</i> as 
are the branches of a tree or its trunk to its roots. They form a whole. The 
organization is therefore a particular construct which possesses precise 
foundations. Just as skin takes different forms, and is smooth or wrinkled 
depending on the general condition of the body, a change in an organization&#8217;s 
foundations brings in its wake a change in the organization. Relations of 
production and economic relations constitute the foundation of man&#8217;s social 
relations; it is upon them that man&#8217;s way of producing what he needs depends. 
Capitalism is the modern form of production. Thus, the current form of 
organization is inseparable from the existence of capitalism itself, it is its 
result. Naturally, it is, like capitalism, subject to change: it ceaselessly 
undergoes metabolism, it grows, ages, dies and is reborn. An historical and 
revolutionary <i>process</i> unfolds. To be born, a new organization must emerge 
from, by means of an often very painful evolution, the upheavals and convulsions 
of which the old organization is still capable. The way in which the combatants 
conceive of this genesis naturally plays a decisive role in this process. One 
could all the more easily demolish the old organization and make room for the 
new one if one knows where the explosives must be placed.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>The Old Organization</h3>

<h4>The State</h4>

<p class="fst">At present, the <i>modern State</i> represents the most advanced 
and most powerful expression of the capitalist system. Will it, or will it not, 
achieve its principal goal, that is, a world economic syndicate and the League 
of Nations? This depends on the struggle, the resistance, and the victory of the 
world proletariat, and on the stages traversed by the latter on its road to 
victory.</p>

<p class="fst">For the proletariat, the capitalist State is the representative 
of the ruling class. It protects the private economy and private property. It is 
the executioner of the exploited. Its justice is class justice. Its organization 
and administration (trusts, trade unions, bureaucracy, militarism, 
parliamentarism, education via school textbooks, etc.) inhibit and repress the 
proletariat. They allow a restricted number of &#8220;guarantors&#8221;, assisted by their 
intellectual slaves, to <i>govern</i> an immense majority of <i>subjects</i>. 
They reduce the proletarians to the status of cogs in a machine. On top: 
leaders, blessed by the gods and untouchable, then the administrators who depend 
entirely upon them, and at the bottom, below all, the masses, dispossessed of 
rights, to whom some crumbs are thrown or who are fitted with the bridle and the 
bit: whether they receive crumbs or the bridle depends upon the ease with which 
it is thought that the &#8220;beast&#8221; can be pacified.</p>

<h4>The Parties</h4>

<p class="fst">The parliament is a link in the chain of the organization, and 
one of the forms of expression, of the capitalist State. <i>Parliamentarism</i> 
is one of the most typical forms of activity in the capitalist world, that is, a 
world of exploited and exploiters, a world of political-economic inequality, a 
world of class struggle. Parliamentarism designates not just the occupations to 
which the &#8220;official&#8221; representative institution is devoted, which today is no 
more than a business office for capitalism, a façade <i>behind which the real 
business is conducted</i> and a safety-valve of capitalism, but it is above all 
a symbol of capitalism. It is the expression of the being, the structure, the 
basic constitution of capital, of its tactics and its methods in the current 
period.</p>

<p class="fst">The form assumed by political parties is bound to 
parliamentarism. So much so that the parties have precisely the character of 
capitalist organizations and are therefore constructed according to the 
following principle: leader and masses; as the leader over the masses, the 
organization goes from the top down. The leader commands, the masses obey. 
Above, a leader or a group of rulers; below, an army of the ruled, a few foxes 
and millions of donkeys. It is the &#8220;Simon Says&#8221; principle. The masses constitute 
the <i>object</i> of politics, an object which the &#8220;leaders&#8221; manipulate in 
accordance with their needs. The instrument of such a party is tactics, or more 
precisely, the <i>tactics of the capitalist businessman</i>, pure fraud. The 
leader is the businessman, the party is his <i>property</i>. The neighboring 
businessman is his competitor. These tactics, the ever-more-refined ways and 
means of capitalist business practice, make for success. They stop at nothing. 
To be a party man means: to enforce spiritual narrow-mindedness, to practice 
charlatanry, to stifle what is human in man.</p>

<p class="fst">The unequal development of capitalism in the various countries, 
the competition between nations, even between racial and cultural communities, 
and, since the second half of the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century, the <i>organized</i> 
combat, defensive and offensive, becoming more noticeable every day, of the 
oppressed proletarian class, temporarily prevent capitalism, as a 
political-economic system, from attaining its ultimate possibility of 
expression, <i>i.e.</i>, centralized rule over the world thanks to a capitalist 
world economic syndicate.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> This era, the second half of the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> 
century, in which the proletariat acquired consciousness of itself as a class by 
comprehending the capitalist process and in which, on the other hand, 
instinctive consciousness led to its comprehension of, that is, to an 
understanding of the necessity of, the <i>class struggle</i>, of proletarian <i>
solidarity</i>, and of international bonds, whose goal is a <i>classless society</i>&#8212;this 
era is the one in which modern communism was born.</p>

<p class="fst">But since capitalism was not yet exhausted and the proletariat 
had not yet formed a mass <i>conscious</i> of belonging to the same class, and 
both continued to develop within one and the same process, it is clear that 
proletarian organization could not be born all at once, and especially prior to 
the political victory of the hitherto oppressed class, an organization which 
would have&#8212;unlike capitalist organization&#8212;a primarily proletarian class 
character and which could utilize proletarian methods of struggle derived from 
that character. Attempts towards this end were made, of which traces can be 
found in the confrontation between Marx and Bakunin. But these attempts were 
naturally weak, or accomplished nothing, or were distorted. Proletarian class 
consciousness developed very slowly (the mere <i>number</i> of members of the 
socialist organizations is of no significance) and the characteristic trait of 
the <i>transitional period</i> bridging that epoch and ours is the flood of a 
multitude of the exploited into the ranks of the social democratic parties and 
trade unions. The struggle of these organizations, as they were being carried 
out on capitalism&#8217;s own terrain, obviously did not require the &#8220;advocacy&#8221; of a 
goal, but advice concerning the road to follow and how to most advantageously 
utilize all the bourgeois strongholds. The trade unions&#8217; fight for wage 
increases and the parliamentary struggle were political necessities in an epoch 
when a slogan like the unhindered right to vote could awaken and provoke 
revolutionary energies. But in the course of this fight, the next goal, which 
was &#8220;the development of proletarian class consciousness&#8221;, was lost sight of 
completely. The point of view according to which &#8220;the emancipation of the 
working class will be the task of the workers themselves&#8221;, and which made the <i>
development of the workers class consciousness</i> the principal task which 
should not be forgotten for even one moment, was increasingly disregarded. The 
more time passed, the more the socialist organizations assumed the character and 
the methods of capitalist organizations. They became &#8220;organizations of leaders&#8221;, 
private property in the hands of those who pulled the strings and who were still 
under the spell of bourgeois capitalist conceptions. They became <i>ends in 
themselves.</i></p>

<p class="fst">The &#8220;leadership&#8221; of the <i>class struggle</i> was in the hands of 
a few individuals who were <i>cut off from the needs of the proletariat</i>. It 
was the victory of parliamentarism which necessarily led to the paralysis of the 
revolutionary activity of the masses. The class struggle and the revolution 
became the concern of a <i>group of high-level managers</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">This trend has not yet come to an end. The &#8220;socialist&#8221; parties, 
or, more properly, the rabble of the parties, only attained their most repugnant 
display after the revolution of 1918. From this point of view, the old social 
democracy is related in a direct line of descent to the &#8220;Unified Communist 
Party&#8221; (VKPD) and the degree of abjectness only increases as we get closer to 
the VKPD.</p>

<h4>The Trade Unions</h4>

<p class="fst">Even more clearly than the parties, the trade unions became 
organizations of a perfectly capitalist nature. Born in an epoch of small-scale 
war against employers who were not yet powerfully organized in cartels, they 
were originally the adequate form for proletarian combat against capitalism&#8217;s 
tendencies towards pauperization.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It was by combating capital, combating its tendencies to 
absolute impoverishment, setting limits to the latter and thus making the 
existence of the working class possible, that the trade union movement fulfilled 
its role in capitalism, and this made it a limb of capitalist society itself...&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Just as parliamentary activity incarnates the leaders&#8217; 
psychological hold over the working masses, so the <i>trade union movement</i> 
incarnates their material authority... In developed capitalism, and even more in 
the epoch of imperialism, the trade unions have become enormous confederations 
which manifest the same developmental tendencies as the bourgeois state in an 
earlier period. There has grown up within them a class of officials, a 
bureaucracy, which controls all the organization&#8217;s resources&#8212;funds, press, the 
appointment of officials; often they have even more far-reaching powers, so that 
they have changed from being the servants of the collectivity to being its 
masters, and have identified themselves with the organization. And the trade 
unions also resemble the state and its bureaucracy in that, democratic forms 
notwithstanding, the will of the members is unable to prevail against the 
bureaucracy... [T]he workers do not control their trade union, but ... it stands 
over them as an external force against which they can rebel, although they 
themselves are the source of its strength&#8212;once again like the state itself&#8221; 
(Pannekoek).<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the final accounting, the trade unions form a bureaucratic 
organization on the margins of the world of the private economy, to which, 
however, its leaders are connected, as veritable permanent employees, for good 
and for ill. Since their existence depends upon the existence of the trade 
unions, they unavoidably find themselves under the pressure of circumstances; 
and their decision-making power is thus increased, while they are more and more 
hesitant to use it even in the best cases.</p>

<p class="fst">The trade unions are organized by trades. They have increasingly 
deviated from the rigorous and implacable idea of the class struggle and instead 
content themselves with demands for better wages and working conditions for the 
various job categories. They have separated the employed workers from the 
unemployed, the young from the old, men from women. The employers, united in 
ever more powerful trusts, put them on the defensive, despite their decline into 
an increasingly more pronounced <i>reformism</i>. They have, whenever possible, 
prevented important strikes. The general strike and the mass strike were 
preventatively denigrated as general nonsense. In effect, such strikes would 
annihilate the trade unions, as well as the existence of their bureaucratic 
leadership.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>Council Organization as Proletarian Organization</h3>

<p class="fst">The decline which has overtaken the capitalist period also 
affects its forms of organization. Our descriptions of the party and the trade 
union clearly show us that their organizational forms are, or have become, 
capitalistic. These organizational forms are <i>economically</i> based upon the 
profit economy and tend to assume a form developed within the private economy: 
State capitalism. These forms, from the ideological point of view (that is, as a 
spiritual reflection of their economic foundations), are the origins of the 
cults of personality, the &#8220;leader&#8221; and authority, and the growth of 
individualism and egoism.</p>

<p class="fst">The formation and growth of the proletarian class naturally 
brings about forms of organization and expression which accord with the 
development of that class. This outcome is obviously not produced unless the 
proletarians have a perfectly-developed <i>consciousness</i> of forming a class 
whose own interests are opposed to those of capitalism. These forms of 
organization and expression are not created overnight and are not perfectly pure <i>
a priori</i> constructions; they evolve thanks to the progress of intellectual 
understanding and the influx of increasingly crucial masses of people. They <i>
will not attain complete maturity</i> unless the proletarian base exists, hence 
until after the disappearance of the private economy and the profit economy, 
which will have been replaced by a <i>communitarian proletarian economy adapted 
to need</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">It is easy to understand that there will be an organization 
unlike capitalist organization when the proletariat will have become a society, 
a total collective owner of all the means of production (mines, factories, 
etc.), of everything which had previously been &#8220;property&#8221;, when everything 
belongs to everyone in common. But before reaching that point, the proletariat 
creates&#8212;and does so all the more effectively the more conscious it is of its 
forming a class&#8212;forms of expression, <i>organs</i>, which incarnate <i>class</i> 
consciousness, social consciousness, the consciousness of mutual solidarity. 
When this form of organization becomes a revolutionary process, it is called <i>
council organization</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">This organization develops by way of an uninterrupted struggle 
against capitalist forms. It disrupts them, smashes them to pieces, it causes 
them to explode. In this new organization, leaders and masses will relate to one 
another differently. The current will not flow from above downwards, but <i>
first of all</i> from below upwards. Then one will be able to witness the living 
interpenetration of the united whole.</p>

<p class="fst">The organization of the councils will be the mortal enemy of all 
bureaucratism, of all parliamentarism, of all partnerships with capital. It will 
be totally based on the masses who are conscious of constituting a class.</p>

<p class="fst">The organization of the councils will therefore&#8212;as long as the 
workers fight for it&#8212;permit liberation from the capitalist yoke, and 
particularly from the yoke of the bourgeois ideological sphere. In its future is 
incarnated the <i>progressive evolution of the self-consciousness</i> of the 
proletariat, the will to transplant the class consciousness of the proletarians 
into reality and to give it a real expression. The intensity of the fight for 
this organization of councils allows one to exactly measure to what extent the 
proletariat conceives of itself as a class and how determined it is to impose 
its will.</p>

<p class="fst">It is equally obvious that the workers councils are not just 
empty words but are completely the expression of the new proletarian 
organization. It could happen that, while developing, authentic councils are 
corrupted and crystallize into a new bureaucracy. It will then be necessary to 
combat them as vigorously as the capitalist organizations. But the course of 
development will not halt, and the proletariat will not stop, until it has given 
the new organization&#8212;the council system&#8212;its historically attainable expression 
in the classless society which lies beyond the &#8220;dictatorship of the 
proletariat&#8221;.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>The Factory Organization</h3>

<p class="fst">The Factory Organization is the preliminary step towards the 
formation of the specifically proletarian organization, or organization in 
councils. The outlines of such an organization have already been created on 
various occasions. But only the <i>revolution</i> clearly left its mark upon the 
Factory Organizations which then could be considered to be the real offspring of 
the most lucid proletarian class consciousness. They were born because they were 
the class weapons of the workers combat. The old organizations, especially the 
trade unions, could not and did not want to play that role.</p>

<p class="fst">The Factory Organizations are not, then, artificial. Nor or they 
the products of confusion. The class consciousness of the proletariat breaks out 
in them with all its power due to the economic relations and the clear 
understanding of specific conditions. They are new institutions which grow from 
the bottom up, expand, shatter all that is old, destroy and uproot it, and 
convert <i>social</i> life and thought into realities.</p>

<p class="fst">No one can deny that we are living in an epoch where the 
capitalist world is on its last legs. Communist production is the only possible 
way out. Now is the time to find the way by which the revolution can be most 
rapidly and successfully brought to a conclusion. It is not enough to take 
political power (the proletarians took political power in 1918)&#8212;one must <i>hold 
on to it</i>. The most urgent task facing the proletarians&#8212;who are still largely 
imbued with capitalist ideology&#8212;is to discover, against the power of capital in 
Western Europe, against the power of its organization (State, militarism, 
parliamentarism, management, bureaucracy, schooling, hierarchy), the possible 
ways to definitively destroy these old forms. But one does not build by 
satisfying oneself with destruction. That which is content to criticize, to 
reject, without being able to offer positive proposals, finally finds a place 
within the bourgeois world. The bourgeois intellectuals also make a harsh 
critique of their world. But scorn, jokes and derision alone are not enough to 
allow the growth of proletarian class consciousness. The struggle against 
centralism and blind obedience, against leaders and trade union <i>bonzes</i>, 
cannot succeed, that is, it will not allow the <i>proletarian revolution</i> to 
move forward, if it is content to fight them to the death and to smash them to 
pieces; it is necessary that purely proletarian forms should arise (as a prelude 
to the organization of the councils) and that these new forms should <i>uproot</i> 
the old. The Factory Organization is the expression of this demand.</p>

<p class="fst">If the workers desire their definitive liberation as a <i>class</i> 
and not just advantages for a few cliques and social strata, <i>it is necessary</i> 
for them to create forms which are completely the work of their own class rather 
than the products of a few &#8220;leaders&#8221;. They must create forms in which autonomous 
thought and action are not just words, but <i>realities</i>. Such forms, having 
issued from their deepest being, that is, having been born from their 
proletarian class will, shall stand totally opposed to all forms which are 
dependent on capitalism, to a greater or lesser degree. While they cannot be 
absolutely &#8220;pure&#8221;, because we are living in a period of transition, their <i>
orientation</i> must be absolute and always <i>clear</i>: their corollary must 
be proletarian <i>solidarity</i>, which for this same reason becomes an 
imperious <i>necessity.</i></p>

<p class="fst">The Factory Organizations are above all <i>organizations of class 
struggle.</i></p>

<p class="fst">United in the AAUD (General Workers Union), they comprise <i>
neither a political party nor a trade union</i>. These two terms are employed in 
accordance with the meanings they have had up until now, that is, referring to 
institutions whose nature we can all understand with reference to today&#8217;s 
parties and trade unions.</p>

<p class="fst">Within these organizations the proletariat begins to consciously 
organize itself for the complete demolition of the old society and for its 
unification as a class. In the Factory Organizations the masses will be united 
by the consciousness of their class solidarity, of their <i>proletarian</i> 
class solidarity: they constitute the location where the unification of the 
proletariat is organically prepared (that is, like a natural process, in 
accordance with the circumstances). The Factory Organization is the beginning of 
the communist future and, as the backbone of the factory councils, will become 
the basis of the future communist society, of the classless society. Classless 
society means communitarian economy and all-encompassing forms of social 
expression. It means the total unification of the <i>economic base</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">At first, everyone will receive as much as possible. Later, 
according to their needs. Everyone will have to work as much as is necessary for 
any given situation.</p>

<p class="fst">The formation of such Factory Organizations as organizations of 
class struggle can only take place in the workplace. There, where each is the 
class brother of the other, all are obliged to be equals, and to have the same 
rights. There, the masses find themselves within the engine of production; they 
incessantly struggle to understand and to control it. There, the spiritual 
battle takes place, the revolutionary transformation of consciousness, in an 
incessant electric current passing from man to man, and from masses to masses. 
Everything is oriented towards the supreme class interest rather than the mania 
of forming organizations. The interest of each trade is reduced to its 
proportionate share. At a more advanced level of development, the Factory 
Organization will become an instrument of class struggle in perpetual motion, an 
institution which is always bubbling with new blood thanks to the permanent 
possibility of new elections, recall, etc.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>The Unity of the Factory Organizations within the AAUD</h3>

<p class="fst">The Factory Organizations, in a profusion of living elements, are 
grouped together in the General Workers Union (AAUD). This association is not an 
arbitrary amalgam of different groups, each separate from the other and existing 
independently, but responds to an internal need. As the council idea develops as 
an expression of the class will of the proletarians, the various Factory 
Organizations must grow along with the latter. In effect, born in pieces, they 
only find their culmination in the vast current of the general evolution which 
leads to the proletarian form of organization. Just as streams end up forming a 
river, they will necessarily unite. Such an association, in conformance with the 
council idea, emerging from the rank and file, is wanted and needed by the 
proletarian class. To fight as an exploited class <i>unites</i>, creates and 
provides a form for the social <i>bond</i>, for proletarian solidarity, and for <i>
class solidarity</i>, which is not expressed in words but in deeds.</p>

<p class="fst">As an organization of the whole, as a beginning of the 
organization of the councils, the AAUD, naturally, is never complete. New 
Factory Organizations will flow into it, and more than once mud and silt will 
spread through it, instead of clear water. It is a natural process. It will be 
obliged to ceaselessly fight for its purity.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>Centralism and Federalism</h3>

<p class="fst">The fight which the AAUD must lead is the class struggle in its 
purest form. It is already carrying on part of this fight by constituting its 
own organization in accordance with the proletarian idea of the councils, in 
opposition to capitalist forms of organization. It strives ceaselessly and in 
every way within the production process to realize this idea in an ever clearer 
and purer form. Its very existence alone is already a threat to all the 
capitalist forces. It provides an example of the progressive development and 
crystallization of proletarian class consciousness, and therefore compels the 
whole proletariat to take a stand. The organization&#8217;s development in this 
direction will increasingly demote to a secondary level the conflict between 
what are known as <i>centralism</i> and <i>federalism</i>. From the AAUD&#8217;s point 
of view, the polemic over these two principles, these two forms of organization, 
will become a dispute of empty words. Obviously, these two terms must be 
understood according to the meanings they have possessed until now, and not 
according to a new meaning foisted upon them.</p>

<p class="fst">By <i>centralism</i> we understand the form which, through the 
will of a minority, bridles and enslaves the masses. For the AAUD, it is a demon 
which must be extirpated. It is antisocial.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Federalism</i> is the opponent of centralism, but an opponent 
operating on the basis of the same economic system. It is the sovereignty, the 
stubborn obstinacy of the individual (or the workshop, or the region, or the 
nation) understood on its own terms. It is equally antisocial and must be fought 
just as vigorously.</p>

<p class="fst">These two forms progressively evolved over centuries past. 
Federalism was victorious in the Middle Ages, while centralism prevailed during 
the period of advanced capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">Sympathy for federalism is based simply on the fact that, by 
seeing it as the negation of centralism, one assumes that it will bring freedom 
and paradise. This desire for federalism leads to a caricature of <i>autonomy</i> 
(the right to self-determination). So it is thought that when one attributes 
autonomy in all domains to each region, to each place (one might also say, to 
each person), one is acting in a social and a proletarian way. In fact, this 
accomplishes nothing except to abolish the empire so as to replace it with a 
number of small principalities. Petty kinglets (local bosses) arise everywhere 
who themselves assume rule over a fraction of the membership in a centralized 
manner, as if it was their own private property: from this, fragmentation and 
general collapse ensues.</p>

<p class="fst">Centralism and federalism are both <i>bourgeois</i> forms of 
expression. Centralism is more typically big bourgeois, while federalism is more 
petit-bourgeois. Both are anti-proletarian and stand in the way of the 
purification of the class struggle. The proletariat knows that it cannot defeat 
capital unless it closes ranks. The more the consolidation of the council system 
advances, the greater will be the gains registered by the proletariat&#8217;s unity in 
both intensity and scope. Within this unity, with its control from below, with 
its unleashing of all proletarian forces and potentials, with its strong bonds 
connecting the leaders to the masses, all conflict will then be absorbed, the 
development of class consciousness and the development of absolute social 
affinity will become realities. First spiritually, and then later in the 
communitarian economy.</p>

<p class="fst">It will be easily understood that all of this is yet in the 
process of becoming and that the road which the AAUD must follow before reaching 
its goal is still a long one, and that many errors will yet be committed (in 
particular, the meddling interference of certain groups or individuals&#8212;which is 
quite understandable as a result of the disorder caused by the confusion of 
secondary tasks); this will provide the &#8220;centralists&#8221; and the &#8220;federalists&#8221;, who 
are for the most part good fighters, although with confused ideas, with the 
continually renewed occasion for protesting against dictatorship or to demand 
more dictatorship. But this must not prevent us from following the correct road; 
which is to say that the proletariat, as an <i>international</i> class, seeks 
and finds, by building the council system, its increasingly more compact unity, 
a unity which it realizes in order to definitively vanquish capitalism and the 
spirit of capitalism, a unity which will later issue into its conclusion as the 
classless society.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>Masses and Leaders</h3>

<p class="fst">The very structure of the AAUD, as clearly manifested in the 
organization&#8217;s statutes, itself engenders between <i>masses and leaders</i> 
relations unlike those prevailing in organizations of the capitalist type. If, 
in the latter, the proletarians are the playthings of all variety of 
politicians, in the AAUD they will increasingly become the masters of their own 
fates, of the fate of their class. The theory according to which the real 
emancipation of the laboring class can only be accomplished by the workers 
themselves becomes a material force.</p>

<p class="fst">The concept of &#8220;masses&#8221; acquires a different meaning than it has 
in the capitalist system. In the minds of the supporters of the private economy, 
the word &#8220;masses&#8221; is always synonymous with corpse, with an object which is 
manipulated at will. It is considered as the &#8220;property&#8221; of certain men, offices 
and cliques. <i>In proletarian thought, on the other hand, the masses do not 
constitute an incoherent collection of confused egos, but instead denotes the 
proletariat to the extent that its class consciousness allows it to indissolubly 
unite social thought and will.</i></p>

<p class="fst">Such masses can only arise through their own increasing activity 
and ceaseless organizational efforts, first in the fight against capital, 
building their own organization; then, in their constant collaboration in the 
production process.</p>

<p class="fst">What we have just said expresses the current understanding of the 
word &#8220;leader&#8221; from the proletarian point of view. This leader must be intimately 
connected to the class-conscious masses. He will represent and organize the life 
and thought of the masses, who will in turn transmit their own enthusiasm to 
him. He must not fight like a businessman does, for his property, for his 
people, for his nation, but as an integral part of the vast proletarian masses 
who feel, who think, and who desire, and who exist throughout the entire world. 
He must not fight while saying, &#8220;I want to transform the proletarian movement 
into <i>my</i> movement, the revolution is <i>my</i> affair, it is me whom you 
must follow&#8221;; all of these sentiments correspond to private capitalism, they 
comprise part of bourgeois ideology.</p>

<p class="fst">As long as it has to fight, the AAUD will therefore not reject 
leaders <i>a priori</i>, which would be equivalent to rejecting all 
intelligence, all ability, all resolute will. If it did so it would no longer be 
a socialist organization but a military and bourgeois prison in which, fatally 
leveled, the human being would be mistaken for the product of a machine. It 
would also be utopian, since the struggle has just begun. This position, 
however, will burden the proletarian leaders with the greatest responsibility. 
The only requirement of the organization and the system will be that all its 
officers are subjected to the strictest <i>control</i>. The council organization 
is to be understood in this <i>sense.</i> It carries out a merciless battle 
against one-man dictatorship, against ruling cliques and organized power centers 
which have separated from the needs and living conditions of the proletarian 
masses and which use the methods of capitalist social climbers. It most 
violently takes its stand against the <i>intellectuals</i>, that is, against 
those persons who use their higher education to transform the proletariat into a 
plaything of their own conceptions and interests.</p>

<p class="fst">The AAUD is the inveterate enemy of the capitalist bourgeoisie 
from both the internal and external points of view. It thus naturally finds 
itself on the terrain of the <i>&#8220;dictatorship of the proletariat&#8221;</i>. Its 
subsequent goal will be to fight for the realization of this dictatorship. Such 
a dictatorship means that <i>in the struggle for the communist and classless 
society there is no compromise of any kind between exploiters and exploited, 
between capital and labor. To attain this goal, it is absolutely necessary for 
the proletariat to have all decision-making power over all of society&#8217;s 
political and economic institutions, via the council organization.</i></p>

<p class="fst">The dictatorship will last until the old powers have disappeared. 
The AAUD stigmatizes as much as it can the imposture of bourgeois democracy, 
which takes for granted an <i>a priori</i> economic inequality.</p>

<p class="fst">It would be a waste of time to dilate upon the nature of that 
kind of democracy (of the ballot-box) to proletarians who have had to endure its 
indelible effects since August 1914. Every democracy of that kind is a 
dictatorship of the owners. At a time when all of the preconditions for the 
proletarian seizure of power are present, that is, when capitalism&#8217;s survival is 
no longer possible except by way of an unprecedented increase of exploitation, 
leading to the deaths of millions upon millions of proletarians, the exploited, 
in ever-increasing numbers, are carrying out a <i>revolutionary</i> struggle 
against &#8220;democracy&#8221; and will not rest until capital lies prostrate at their 
feet. One cannot expect a voluntary abdication, except perhaps one which is only 
for appearance&#8217;s sake (as in Hungary, for example). Once the proletariat becomes 
the ruling class and while communism is being built, it will have to use every 
means to demolish every counterrevolutionary movement; it will have to use <i>
violence</i>. Otherwise, it would commit suicide. The dictatorship of the 
proletariat is irreconcilable with the freedom of the bourgeoisie. To deny this 
would be either the result of a lack of understanding, the chatter of priests, 
utopia, or a direct or indirect defense of the counterrevolution.</p>

<p class="fst">But the AAUD&#8217;s clear profession of faith in favor of the 
&#8220;dictatorship of the proletariat&#8221; consists equally of the fundamental rejection 
of any kind of collaboration with capital. It is the profession of faith in 
favor of the proletarian struggle relying on its own methods.</p>

<p class="fst">The politics, or, to put it another way, the struggle of such an 
organization, has an <i>a priori</i> proletarian class character. This means 
above all rejecting any form of parliamentarism regardless of its type. It 
should also be said, expressed negatively, that all parliamentarism leads to the 
sabotage of the proletarian revolution as soon as such Factory Organizations 
come into existence.</p>

<p class="fst">Furthermore, <i>the AAUD&#8217;s battle is entirely international</i>. 
The proletariat, as a <i>class</i>, acts resolutely only as a result of its 
international, unified character. The internationalist point of view stands in 
the forefront. The AAUD&#8217;s goal is <i>the international communitarian economy</i> 
and, finally, <i>humanity as a classless society</i>. The form taken by its 
struggle is naturally linked to a certain extent to the conditions in each 
country. It will, from the very start, incessantly strive to create links 
between and to unite the revolutionary councils of the various countries.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1]</a> Prior to and during the war, revolutionaries were debating 
whether a single world capitalist State was in the offing. The majority arrived 
at the conclusion (correctly, in our view) that this was impossible: 
competition, even monopolistic competition, is the very soul of capital. Applied 
on the scale of a single country, this &#8220;super-imperialism&#8221; hypothesis evolved to 
become the theory of &#8220;State capitalism&#8221;, later elaborated by Bruno Rizzi (<i>L&#8217;URRS, 
collectivisme bureaucratique</i>, Part 1, 1939; Champ Libre, 1976. For an 
English translation, see <i>The Bureaucratization of the World;</i> London, 
Tavistock/New York, Free Press, 1985), and by some elements of the German Left, 
and, after 1945, by the journal <i>Socialisme ou Barbarie</i>. Concerning the 
latter group, see the well-documented book by P. Gottraux published by Payot 
(Lausanne, 1998).</p>
