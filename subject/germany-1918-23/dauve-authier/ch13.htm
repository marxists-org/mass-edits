<h3><a name="h1">The Founding of the VKPD</a></h3>

<p class="fst">After the leftists were excluded, in a process which started at 
the Second Congress (October 1919) and was completed by the Third Congress 
(February 1920), the KPD, strictly speaking, no longer existed. The reports of 
the delegates to the Third Congress provided evidence of the party&#8217;s utter 
prostration. In Berlin, out of 8,000 members, only 500 supported the central 
committee; in Essen, 43 out of 2,000, etc. &#8220;After his experience in 
Rhineland-Westphalia, Brandler resigned himself to saying, &#8216;We no longer have a 
party at all&#8217;.&#8221;<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> Its weakness led the KPD to regularly support the directives 
of the USPD during this period, and was also the reason for the extremely 
&#8220;prudent&#8221; position it assumed in March of 1920.</p>

<p class="fst">The USPD, on the other hand, was flourishing. It took full 
advantage of the SPD&#8217;s deception of its voters and militants. It had 750,000 
members in 1920. This was the raw material for the construction of a fraternal 
&#8220;mass party&#8221; for the Communist International. Lenin wrote in his <i>Infantile 
Disorder</i>, in relation to the &#8220;proletarian groundswell&#8221; of the USPD, that the 
USPD &#8220;was conducting a relentless struggle against opportunism&#8221;.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> The 21 
Conditions for admission were intended, among other things, to allow this 
leftist groundswell to join the Communist International. In October 1920, the 
Halle Congress of the USPD voted in favor of joining the Communist International 
by a vote of 234 to 158.</p>

<p class="fst">On December 5, 1920, the USPD-KPD Unification Congress was held: 
the new party was called the <i>Unified</i> Communist Party of Germany (VKPD), 
and had at least 400,000 members. As Heckert, a VKPD delegate to the Third World 
Congress would say: &#8220;The Communist Party, at the moment of its unification, 
became a mass party...&#8221;<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> The German section of the Communist International had 
been formed by means of deals between parties, between the parties&#8217; leaders, and 
would never belie this origin.</p>

<p class="fst">Even when, during the crisis of 1929, the KPD accepted a large 
number of unemployed workers into its ranks, it had already replaced the SPD in 
various sectors of the working class, above all in the recently-industrialized 
regions which had no socialist cadres.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> Without totally supplanting the SPD, 
it had become the second great German workers party. Instead of criticizing the 
Communist Party&#8217;s positions during the Weimar Republic, one should recall that 
this &#8220;Communist Party&#8221; was the heir of the anti-communist centrism of the years 
between 1917 and 1920. The essential character of the revolutionary party 
created at the end of 1918 was to be upheld by the leftist groups and would 
disappear with the victory of the reaction.</p>

<p class="fst">Based on his study of Hamburg, Comfort concluded that the members 
of the SPD did not comprise a labor aristocracy in the sense of a distinct 
privileged stratum, but that it was a sociologically more homogeneous group than 
the USPD, which was in turn more homogeneous than the KPD, which included in its 
membership workers from very diverse social layers.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> The communist militants 
were also younger and less experienced than those of the SPD. This led Comfort 
to deduce that the KPD was more independent of an apparatus and, above all, of 
one (or several) specific social layer(s) than the other parties. The SPD and 
the ADGB had not been able to adapt to modern industrialization and the growth, 
in both numbers and importance, of the workers in large industry, especially 
since the majority of the Hamburg SPD&#8217;s leaders, after the war, were former 
trade unionists.</p>

<p class="fst">On January 8, 1921, utilizing its new forces, the VKPD initiated 
a large-scale campaign in the purest style of the &#8220;workers united front&#8221;. The 
central committee sent an &#8220;open letter&#8221; to all &#8220;workers organizations&#8221;, from the 
most reactionary trade unions to the KAPD and the AAUD, proposing a joint 
struggle against capitalism. Written by Radek and Levi, the letter called for a 
campaign to increase wages, dissolve the &#8220;bourgeois defense organizations&#8221;, 
create workers self-defense organizations, and to compel Germany to re-establish 
diplomatic relations with Russia. It was hoped that, should the recipients 
reject this joint action, they would stand revealed as traitors before the 
masses, and would lose all their influence; should they accept, it was thought 
that they would be obliged to collaborate with the KPD so as to continue to 
appear to be revolutionaries, and the KPD would thereby become the driving force 
of the movement. This action was to have an &#8220;educational&#8221; value for the 
&#8220;masses&#8221;. According to the formula of <i>Infantile Disorder</i>, the KPD would 
have caught the organizations which called themselves revolutionary just as the 
&#8220;rope catches the hanged man&#8221;. The KAPD and the AAUD, &#8220;prisoners of their 
ultra-leftism&#8221;, rejected the proposal.</p>

<p class="fst">At the Third World Congress, Lenin sang the praises of this 
tactic: &#8220;The &#8216;Open Letter&#8217; is exemplary. It must be unconditionally defended.&#8221; 
Terracini, a PCI delegate, requested that such methods be renounced, and quoted 
(KAPD delegate) Hempel&#8217;s statement: &#8220;The Open Letter is opportunist, it cannot 
be remedied.&#8221; Lenin responded: &#8220;The Open Letter is exemplary as the opening act 
of the practical method to effectively win over the majority of the working 
class.&#8221;<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This tactic responded to a precise objective, as was revealed by 
the debate within the KPD central committee which took place on January 28, 
1921, and was advocated with particular vehemence by Radek and Levi. To come 
into contact with the masses, it was necessary to remain in contact with their 
representatives, whether &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;left&#8221;.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> It was therefore necessary to 
undertake international negotiations with the &#8220;syndicalists&#8221;, and in Germany to 
maintain contacts with the KAPD, so as to attract their best elements. Radek 
based his argument on the fact that the German working class had a high rate of 
trade union membership, and concluded that it was necessary to take the other 
parties and organizations into consideration. Levi refused to attack the KAPD 
but also refused to identify the KPD with the KAPD. &#8220;We have to keep up 
appearances for the German workers.&#8221; Brandler adopted a different tone: &#8220;I have 
insisted that we must not cease to hit out at the KAPD.&#8221; Violence or &#8220;Open 
Letter&#8221;, the goal is the same, to make the KPD appear to be revolutionary in the 
eyes of the masses, so that the masses would support it. A theatrical stage upon 
which their organization could represent itself as &#8220;credible&#8221;, so that the 
masses would support it. It was a matter of winning the &#8220;trust&#8221; of the masses.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">Elimination of the Former Spartacists from the KPD Leadership</a></h3>

<p class="fst">If a &#8220;leftist&#8221; tendency immediately took power in the VKPD, this 
was in part the result of unification: the whole party felt the strength of its 
numbers and thought it could seize power by non-parliamentary means. In 
addition, there was a tendency in the Communist International which, aware of 
the crisis of Bolshevik power after the civil war, wanted to bring about a civil 
war in Germany at any cost, and dispatched a delegation from the Communist 
International to Germany, led by B. Kun; Levi, Zetkin and the other rightists in 
the leadership would clash with this delegation.</p>

<p class="fst">It was at this moment that the &#8220;Italian question&#8221; had a direct 
impact on the affairs of the KPD. In Livorno (January 1921), Levi had naturally 
sympathized with the party of Italian centrism (cf. Chapter 8).<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> The pro-KPD 
position of the Italian Left was therefore all the more contradictory in that it 
had directly suffered from the effects of the KPD&#8217;s rightist orientation. Levi, 
displaying his opposition to the PCI as it had been constituted in 1921, proved 
that the &#8220;principles&#8221; he had defended against the German Left were nothing but 
the cover for his opportunism. At Livorno, Levi confronted the Communist 
International&#8217;s emissaries, supporters of the same strictness upheld by the 
Italian Left, and just as desirous as the latter of breaking with the <i>center</i> 
as well as with the right. Upon Levi&#8217;s return to Germany, the Italian polemic 
was added to the debate on the correct orientation of the KPD. Levi, referring 
to Livorno before the central committee (February 1921), diagnosed the 
&#8220;beginning of a crisis in the KPD and the Communist International&#8221;: for the 
first time, a split took place within a party which was <i>already</i> a member 
of the Communist International.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> Rakosi, however, deduced from the Italian 
experience a lesson which could be generalized to other countries.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> He 
alluded to the French and Czech Communist Parties and, among other things, to 
the case of Cachin, &#8220;who is a freemason&#8221;. &#8220;Besides the fact that <i>we want to 
set a precedent</i>, this question is not a purely Italian question.&#8221; He 
denounced Levi&#8217;s position in Livorno before the central committee. Losing the 
vote by 28 votes to 25, Levi resigned, together with other members of the 
central committee, including Zetkin.</p>

<p class="fst">The new leftist leadership of the central committee, led by 
Frölich, appointed a series of leaders from the &#8220;proletarian base&#8221; of the USPD. 
At the Third World Congress, the KAPD would speak of a &#8220;new, improved and 
revised version&#8221; of the KPD. This new version was based upon a new leftist 
tendency which had appeared in Berlin after the creation of the KAPD, under E. 
Reuter. The Bremen Left had criticized the KPD&#8217;s &#8220;loyalty&#8221; during the Kapp 
Putsch, but had also repeated Levi&#8217;s critiques of the KAPD, in which it had 
detected harmful decentralizing tendencies; nor was it entirely mistaken. But 
its union with the KPD&#8212;which, despite its opportunism, did appear to be the only 
Marxist organization of any importance in Germany&#8212;was a remedy worse than the 
disease it was meant to cure. Bremen had separated from that of which it was 
naturally a part: the German <i>Left</i>, depriving the latter of its precious 
contribution, which would have perhaps allowed an original and active synthesis. 
By reinforcing the KPD, it was entangled as the opposition within a party whose 
rightward course could not be rectified. The KPD&#8217;s leftist detour, which 
predated March 1921, was deceptive: the USPD contributed to the KPD its own 
vacillation between reform and adventurism, between parliament and the streets. 
&#8220;Opportunism&#8221; and putschism are the two sides of the same coin, as Lukàcs had 
perspicaciously analyzed the problem:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The decisive theoretical aspect can be reduced, expressed 
negatively: in the inability of the two groups (opportunists and putschists) to 
conceive of the <i>revolution as a process</i>; positively expressed: in their 
erroneous overestimation of the <i>organization</i> in the revolutionary 
movement.&#8221; For both, the struggle can only be the product of the organization; 
they do not see that there is &#8220;a permanent interaction between the preconditions 
and their consequences during the course of the action&#8221;. &#8220;One could even say, if 
one has to choose between one of these points of view, that the organization 
must be conceived more as the consequence than as the precondition.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There is no need to cite examples to illustrate this mode of 
thought and action among the opportunists; the way they make ballots compatible 
with membership cards, their expectation that the &#8216;moment&#8217; will arrive when a 
sufficiently large number of proletarians will be sufficiently well-organized, 
is perfectly well-known. But it is surprising to confirm the analogous way the 
putschists operate. They do not count ballots, but revolvers, machine guns, 
etc.; a &#8220;good organization&#8221; needs less men; its effectiveness is not that of an 
electoral machine or a trade union, but that of an illegal military 
organization: all of this, in fact, changes very little in terms of their 
theoretical foundations. The putschists also conceive of organization and action 
as two distinct stages separated from one another...&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The overestimation and the mechanistic concept of organization 
necessarily have the consequence of neglecting and demoting to second place the <i>
totality</i> of the revolutionary process to the benefit of an <i>immediate 
visible result</i>.&#8221;<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The former <i>Bremerlinke</i> had the illusion that it could 
drive the party towards the left, when all it did was help the party make one of 
its voluntaristic U-turns.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> Mattick defined Bremen as the most advanced 
tendency, but with this proviso: &#8220;the ambiguity which characterized the politics 
of the <i>Spartakusbund</i> was to a great extent the result of the conservatism 
of the masses.&#8221;<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> According to Frölich, after the &#8220;line had been set straight&#8221; 
at Heidelberg, the party went too far to the right, allowing the opportunity 
presented by the Kapp Putsch to slip through its hands.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> The new leadership 
defined communist tactics in the following manner:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Should the action encounter any obstacles, they must know how to 
scale back their directives, and should it be necessary, they must quickly 
withdraw from the struggle and take refuge among the masses; but during certain 
times of tension, the communists must also go to the masses and assume the 
initiative in the struggle, even at the risk of being followed by only a part of 
the workers.&#8221;<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The first clause alludes to situations of the sort encountered 
in Berlin in January 1919; the second would be applied in March 1921. The VKPD 
was headed towards insurrectionary action.</p>
