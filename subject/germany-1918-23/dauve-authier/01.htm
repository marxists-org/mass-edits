<h1>Resolution of the Conference<br>
of the Abstentionist Communist Fraction<br>
of the Italian Socialist Party</h1>

<hr>

<p class="fst">The National Conference of the abstentionist communist fraction 
of the Socialist Party of Italy was held in Florence on May 8 and 9, 1920.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">After hearing the report of the Central Committee<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> and the 
reports from the representatives of the party&#8217;s<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> leadership, the fraternal 
fractions,<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> and the youth federation; and after another debate on the 
political situation in Italy and trends in the PSI,</p>

<p class="fst">the Conference declares that the party, as a result of its 
current composition and activity, is not qualified to lead the proletarian 
revolution, and that its numerous defects have their origin in: 1) the presence 
of a reformist tendency within the party which, in the decisive phase of the 
class struggle, will necessarily assume a counterrevolutionary position; 2) the 
continued existence of traditional language in political and economic activity;</p>

<p class="fst">the Conference unambiguously declares that the PSI&#8217;s membership 
in the Third International cannot be considered to be in conformance with the 
statutes of the International, since the party tolerates the presence of 
precisely those elements who deny the principles of the Communist International, 
and who publicly defame them, or, even worse, demagogically speculate with them 
in order to obtain electoral success;</p>

<p class="fst">and considering that the true instrument of the revolutionary 
struggle of the proletariat is the class political party, which is based on 
Marxist doctrine and the historical experience of the communist revolutionary 
process, which is currently unfolding throughout the world, and which is already 
victorious in Soviet Russia;</p>

<p class="fst">the Conference declares that <i>it will devote all its efforts to 
creating a communist party of Italy, as a section of the Third International</i>, 
and that the fraction will persevere, both within this party as well as within 
the International itself, in <i>emphasizing the incompatibility of participation 
in elections to bourgeois representative institutions with communist methods and 
principles</i>, in the hope that other purely communist elements in the 
socialist party will also place themselves upon the basis of the new party, in 
the conviction that choice is only possible after abandoning those methods of 
political activity which now practically place them in the social democratic 
camp; the Central Committee is delegated the following tasks:</p>

<p class="indentb">1) preparing the program and statutes of the new party, always 
keeping in mind the program presented by the fraction at the Congress of 
Bologna, as well as the orientation maintained by the fraction&#8217;s organ<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> in the 
discussion of the most important current problems of communist methods and 
tactics;</p>

<p class="indentb">2) expanding international outreach in order to create <i>a 
fraction within the communist International which is opposed to electoral 
participation</i>, and defending the fraction&#8217;s mandate at the next 
international congress, with the demand that action be taken to provide a 
solution to the abnormal situation of the Socialist Party of Italy;</p>

<p class="indentb">3) convoking, immediately after the next international congress, 
the founding congress of the communist party, and demanding that all those 
groups within or outside of the PSI which lay claim to the communist program 
should join the party;</p>

<p class="indentb">4) summarizing the basic positions and tactics of the fraction in 
clear and effective principles, and disseminating them as widely as possible in 
Italy and in other countries.</p>

<p class="fst">The agreement to create an effective antiparliamentary fraction 
within the Third International could very well be of the utmost importance for 
the International itself. We can also see how, as in the case of the creation of 
the Zimmerwald movement during the war, when it was a matter of uniting all the 
forces which were faithful to socialism, Italy again seizes the initiative to 
fight, now within the communist movement, against all kinds of parliamentarism 
and opportunism. Opinions differed in regard to what position should be taken on 
the elections. A small group defended its opposition to the elections with tooth 
and nail, and finally a motion was approved, which was also signed by comrade 
Amadeo Bordiga:</p>

<p class="fst">The National Communist Conference, with regard to the fraction&#8217;s 
continued membership in the socialist party throughout the electoral period of 
the administrative elections, declares its adherence to the following position:</p>

<p class="fst">The abstentionists will not by any means or in any way 
participate in the elections, and, wherever possible, will prevent a party 
electoral slate from being presented, and will advocate abstention with all the 
means at their disposal.</p>

<p class="fst">After voting on some organizational matters, and electing the 
comrades Amadeo Bordiga, Ludovico Torsia, Rodolfo Gobert, Tommaso, Borraccetri, 
Antonio Pisacane and Antonio Cecchi to the Central Committee, the conference 
adjourned.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1]</a> We include this short text of the Italian Left (extracted from 
<i>Il Soviet</i> and published by <i>Kommunismus</i>) in this collection because 
it shows, in opposition to the legend maintained by Bordiga and the Bordigists, 
that the entire Italian Left was actually more &#8220;leftist&#8221; than the 
image they later tried to disseminate. This text reveals: 1) that, prior to the crucial 
Second Congress of the Communist International, the Italian Left almost made the 
issue of non-participation a question of principle; 2) that it had intended to 
form, upon the foundation of this principle, a left opposition within the 
International and that it had already judged that the latter organization was 
infected with &#8220;opportunism&#8221;, and finally, above all, 3) that it had the 
intention of calling, on its own initiative (and not within the framework of a 
socialist party congress, as had occurred at Livorno), <i>and as soon as 
possible</i>, a founding congress of the communist party in Italy.</p>

<p class="endnote">As is known, &#8220;events&#8221; took a totally different turn. 
The Italian Left unconditionally accepted the discipline of the Communist 
International and never formed an international fraction within it; it 
set the parliamentary question aside as a secondary matter, and, out 
of discipline, participated in the elections; the party was not founded 
until January 1921, when the last wave of the workers movement (summer 
1920) had receded.</p>

<p class="endnote">Once the anathema was pronounced against Bordiga and the winners 
had concealed his role, a vigorous reaction was launched to defend the opposite 
viewpoint. Bordiga was indisputably the leader of the first communist party, 
this could not be denied; does this imply, however, that he exactly expressed 
the most profound and subversive tendencies of the abstentionist fraction? The 
fact is that Bordiga and the other members of the Central Committee never 
carried out the mandate with which they were charged by the fraction&#8217;s 
conference. The fraction, after the Second Congress, still had confidence in 
Bordiga, because it was incapable of creating another leadership. One can 
undoubtedly discern, in Bordiga and the first leadership of the PCI, the 
tendency to adapt to circumstances; something which once again took place in 
1923 when Bordiga (for the simple reason that Gramsci, although heavily 
outnumbered, would not agree to sign the document) withdrew a manifesto of the 
party in which he called for a debate concerning the opportunism of the 
Communist International and an apparent break with party discipline (the draft 
of this manifesto is reproduced in <i>Revista Storica del Socialismo</i>, 
November-December 1964, and in French in <i>Invariance</i>, No. 7); this 
attitude was also revealed when Bordiga suddenly forgot his doubts about the 
revolutionary nature of the Communist International during the Fourth Congress 
when the program was finally presented and adopted.</p>

<p class="endnote">Except for the degree of their isolation within their separate contexts, Bordiga played the same role in the PCI left which Rosa Luxemburg played in the nascent KPD; the difference being: 1) the distance between Bordiga and the rest of the party was much less than that which separated Luxemburg from the revolutionary members of the KPD; 2) Luxemburg was situated within left reformism; Bordiga had illusions about the revolutionary power of the Communist International and the good intentions of the Russian leadership; these positions contributed to preventing the free development of the revolutionary tactics of the western proletariat and neutralizing the new power represented by the PCI, a power which was killed without its ever having been able to clearly assume an authentically representative form.</p>

<p class="endnote">Bordiga&#8217;s defining characteristics (equally valid for the period 
after 1945) were the following: trenchant in his theoretical works (although 
this facet often had two faces) and lenient (not prone to take drastic action) 
in practical affairs.</p>

<p class="endnote">(For a leftist group on the PCI left, see the <i>Communist Awakening</i> group, which appeared at the end of 1927 and was active until 1929. Although it held Bordiga in high esteem, it opposed his leniency towards the Communist International; but a perusal of its journal shows that it could by no means contend with the Bordigists for party leadership).</p>
