<h3><a name="h1">The Russian Question</a></h3>

<p class="fst">During the 1920s, the dominant conception was that the peasants 
were the ruling class in Russia. Later, approximately in the mid-1930s, the 
thesis of &#8220;State Capitalism&#8221;, originally conceived by Rühle in 1920 (cf. Chapter 
16), prevailed within the GIKH. The <i>Theses on Bolshevism</i> (1934) analyzed 
the entire process which resulted in Stalinist Russia: it was, more or less, 
similar to the idea expressed in our introduction to Trotsky&#8217;s <i>Report of the 
Siberian Delegation</i>. Pannekoek was the first to bring this conception to 
Northwest Europe, with his article &#8220;De Arbeiders het Parlament en het 
Communisme&#8221; (<i>Rätekorrespondenz</i>). He applied it in his <i>Lenin and 
Philosophy</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Another group, which was close to Mattick, and which published <i>
De Arbeidersraad</i>, did not want to hear anything of &#8220;State Capitalism&#8221; and 
&#8220;State Socialism&#8221;, and still considered the Bolshevik Party to be a &#8220;peasant 
party&#8221;, even after collectivization: cf. Volume II, No. 2, February 1936.</p>

<p class="fst">A text written by a French worker who had worked in Russia had a 
great deal of influence on the Dutch Left in relation to this particular issue: <i>
Ce qu&#8217;est devenue la Révolution russe</i>, by Yvon, published in Paris in 1937.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">Nazism and Fascism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Like the Italian Left, the German Left of that time had the merit 
of having denounced democratic anti-fascism and anti-Nazism as the &#8220;worst 
products of fascism&#8221; (Bordiga), as well as of never having resorted to using the 
political arguments of Nazism as the KPD had in the early 1930s, and of never 
having offered its collaboration to Mussolini as the Italian Communist Party had 
at the end of the 1930s.</p>

<p class="fst">Under Nazism, the position of the German Left was to contribute 
to the formation of communist workers groups on the same basis as in the early 
1920s, but under conditions of clandestinity: &#8220;No &#8216;special&#8217; communist program 
for Germany&#8221; (cf. <i>Masses</i>, No. 1). Its ideological position would evolve. 
Until 1933 it did not believe that Nazism would be successful. When Hitler took 
power, the small publications which were still being published predicted his 
rapid downfall: the policy of setting the unemployed to work on various 
&#8220;unproductive&#8221; projects would not prevent a new round of inflation and the 
aggravation of the deteriorating living conditions of the working class, which 
would go on the offensive. They also criticized the false democratic 
alternatives. When, after the passage of a few years, Nazism was 
well-established, and the situation of the workers had improved, making Hitler 
as popular among them as among the other social classes, the leftists were the 
first to admit this fact and to try to explain it. They interpreted the behavior 
of the German proletarians as the result of what they had been taught in the old 
workers movement (Lassalle and social democracy) which had always said that the 
State is the providence of all of society: one must expect everything from State 
measures and nothing from spontaneous actions (cf. <i>Spartacus</i>, published 
by a working group of revolutionary workers in Amsterdam, No. 3, 1936 or 1937). 
Pannekoek would add his critique of the Bolshevik cult of the party and its 
leaders: cf. <i>The Workers Councils</i>, quoted by F. Kool, p. 570.</p>

<p class="fst">At this stage, the result was an attitude of non-participation, 
of choosing neither side; in the Second World War, Rühle declared in 1939, 
fascism-nazism-stalinism would be victorious because they corresponded to the 
general tendency of capitalism towards State Capitalism. It was useless to 
defend the democracies; the only real alternative to fascism was the proletarian 
revolution. &#8220;The struggle against fascism begins with the struggle against 
Bolshevism&#8221;: this thesis was also shared by Mattick and, in general, by all the 
leftists (cf. our commentary, Chapter 17).</p>

<p class="fst">On the eve of Hitler&#8217;s seizure of power in 1933:</p>

<p class="indentb">&#8220;Hitler&#8217;s victory opens the door to civil war&#8221;, &#8220;Heinrich

des National-Sozialismus&#8221;, <i>Kampfruf</i>, Vol. XIV, Nos. 3 and 3-4, February 
1933.</p>

<p class="indentb">&#8220;Die proletarische Front&#8221;, &#8220;The &#8216;redemption of the nation&#8217; 
begins&#8221;, special edition of <i>KAZ</i>, Year 3, No. 2, February 1933.</p>

<p class="fst">After the stabilization of the regime (in addition to the <i>
Spartacus</i> article cited above):</p>

<p class="indentb">&#8220;To the groups of the GIKH&#8221;, <i>Rätekorrespondenz</i>, No. 16-17, 
May 1936.</p>

<p class="indentb">&#8220;Is Nazi-Duitsland Kapitalistische?&#8221;, <i>Radencommunisme</i>, 
Year 1, No. 8, 1939.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There is little material concerning World War Two (in comparison 
with the Italian Left), and nothing we are aware of, except the articles by 
Korsch reproduced in <i>Marxism and Counterrevolution</i>, Chapter XII.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">The &#8220;Death Crisis&#8221;</a></h3>

<p class="fst">It would be impossible to <i>summarize</i> the theses and debates 
on this issue. For the supporters of the death crisis thesis, we cite: 
&#8220;Wereldcrisis, wereldrevolutie&#8221;,<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> <i>De Arbeidersraad</i>, Year 1, No. 8, 
August 1935, and an article by Mattick in <i>Rätekorrespondenz</i>, No. 4, 1934, 
a response to a previous article by Pannekoek. This tendency, after having 
returned to Luxemburg&#8217;s conceptions in the 1920s, saw its concept of the death 
crisis confirmed by the social democratic economist H. Grossmann, who published <i>
Das Akkumulations und zusammenbruchs gesetz des Kapitalistischen systems</i> in 
1929 (reprinted by Verlag Neue Kritik, Frankfort, 1967). Pannekoek criticized 
Grossmann in the article we reproduce below (cf. Chapter XII of C. Brendel&#8217;s 
book on Pannekoek).</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">Fundamentals and Content of Communism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The supplement to the first issue of <i>ICO</i> published the 
translation of a text from 1935 (<i>Rätekorrespondenz</i>, Nos. 10-11): &#8220;Average 
social labor time, basis for communist production and distribution&#8221;, which 
summarizes the <i>Grundprinzipien des Kommunistischen Produktion und Verteilung</i>, 
reprinted by Rüdiger-Blankertz Verlag, West Berlin. All subsequent texts on this 
subject (Mattick, Pannekoek&#8217;s <i>Workers Councils</i>) would accept this idea as 
their basis.</p>

<p class="fst">Various texts show that the left (after the 1930s) did not 
theorize its break with democracy, &#8220;freedom&#8221;, etc., and that its rejection of 
the dictatorship of the proletariat was not just a matter of words: &#8220;Communism 
and Intellectual Freedom&#8221;, <i>Radencommunisme</i>, Year 1, No. 12, August 1939, 
and &#8220;Arbeiders-demokratie in de bedrijven&#8221;<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> by C. Meijer, in the same journal, in 
1944 or 1945. This culminated in <i>The Workers Councils</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Most of the texts mentioned in this bibliography cannot be found 
&#8220;for sale&#8221;, but can be consulted or photocopied at the International Institute 
for Social History, 262-266 Herengracht, Amsterdam.</p>
