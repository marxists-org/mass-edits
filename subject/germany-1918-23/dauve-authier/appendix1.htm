<h3><a name="h1">Sectarianism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The disagreements between the KAPD and Rühle and between the AAUD 
and the AAUD-E, Mattick writes, &#8220;had no practical meaning... The more one 
thought in collective terms, the more isolated one became. Capitalism, in its 
fascistic form, appeared as the only real collectivism...&#8221;<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The reduction of the great organizations of the German Left to 
the status of <i>sects</i> was the consequence of both the end of the revolution 
in 1921 and of the willingness of a certain number of German Left Communists to 
preserve their organizations during a period when they no longer played any real 
role at all in the practical struggles of a working class which had turned in 
its entirety towards reformist action. Their activity, however, was not 
reproduced or permanently revived by the real movement. The groups ossified, and 
nothing was left of them except a skeletal apparatus composed for the most part 
of old leaders from an intellectual or petty bourgeois background. The mass of 
workers who had joined these organizations oriented towards revolutionary action 
returned to &#8220;normal life&#8221;, since, for the proletariat, the revolution is a 
moment of &#8220;normal life&#8221; which arises when this &#8220;life&#8221; becomes too intolerable, 
and when the capitalist mode of production, which assures the conditions of this 
life, itself enters into crisis. The revolution is not a myth, an ideal which 
must become reality. The revolution is not &#8220;made&#8221; by &#8220;making it&#8221;, even when 
everyone enjoys making it.</p>

<p class="fst">In the <i>Communist Workers International</i> (1923), Gorter 
expounds the idea that the revolution&#8217;s worst enemies (for a limited, but 
extensive period) are <i>all the workers</i> of all countries. Despite his own 
inclinations, this recognition obliges him not only to reject the willingness to 
attach oneself &#8220;to the masses&#8221; in such a period, but also to reexamine 
traditional revolutionary activity (&#8220;agitation&#8221;, &#8220;propaganda&#8221;) among the 
workers. On the one hand, the understanding of this point undermines the 
workerist tendency present in the German Left. On the other hand, it prohibits 
trying to exhort the workers to make the revolution. This is what Marx thought 
after 1850, and Bordiga after 1945: but a good part of the left did not take 
this into account and persisted in its activism.</p>

<p class="fst">To speak of <i>sects</i> is not merely to indicate the small size 
of organizations such as the KAPD after 1923, or the fact that all of the left 
groups taken together, which counted hundreds of thousands of members between 
1920 and 1921, and 20,000 in 1923, had only a few hundred members when Hitler 
seized power. The word <i>sect</i> also characterizes a whole range of political 
practices.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> People get together, for example, &#8220;on the basis of certain ideas&#8221; 
and work to spread them (in this case the idea of the councils, the idea of the 
self-activity of the masses, the idea of unitary organization, etc.). Sects have 
a whole organizational ritual, congresses where speeches are made, resolutions 
adopted, schisms of historical importance take place, etc. After its decline in 
the early 1920s, the left did &#8220;practically&#8221; nothing, that is, its impact on 
immediate reality was null. Its theoretical activity primarily consisted of <i>
repeating</i> some ideas which had been <i>produced</i> by the German 
revolution; Pannekoek and the Group of International Communists of Holland 
(GIKH), however, did undertake some theoretical elaboration of these basic 
themes.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">The KAI and the Schism in the KAPD</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The birth of the KAI coincided with the decomposition of the KAPD 
and the AAUD. In reality, it was still-born. Trotsky was unaware of just how 
correct he was by prophesying at the Third Congress: &#8220;The danger that it would 
grow larger is the least of the problems which would confront a Fourth 
International, should the latter ever be founded.&#8221;<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">On July 31, the Central Committee of the KAPD appointed a 
committee to prepare the foundation of a new international by establishing 
contacts with various leftist groups in other countries. Two tendencies soon 
confronted one another over this issue, to which was added the question of 
participation in wage struggles. The first conflict was between the political 
and ideological leaders in Berlin (Schröder, Goldstein, Sachs) and the KAPD 
&#8220;administrative committee&#8221; (<i>Geschäftsführender Hauptschuss</i>), also in 
Berlin. In effect, in order to &#8220;assure democracy within the organization&#8221;, two 
party leaderships overlapped with one another: the administrative committee and 
the <i>Zentrale</i> or central committee. The administrative committee was 
elected by the party congress in order to attend to day-to-day affairs between 
congresses. The central committee included, in addition to the administrative 
committee, one delegate from each party district, and met whenever a political 
problem arose which had not been addressed by the preceding party congress. The 
administrative committee was elected by a simple majority of the congress: since 
the Berlin district represented the majority of the KAPD&#8217;s membership, only 
Berliners were elected to this committee, especially since the great majority of 
the party&#8217;s vital centers were in Berlin. This arsenal of statutes would allow 
the &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; room to maneuver in order to get their viewpoints accepted 
in the party, since the majority of the administrative committee did not 
necessarily agree with the central committee: this would lead to a split.</p>

<p class="fst">The group centered around Schröder, who was the leading spirit 
behind an &#8220;international office of information and organization for the KAI&#8221;, 
came into conflict with the party majority, who judged the construction of an 
international to be inopportune before the establishment of the KAPD on a more 
solid footing, whose cadres and general capabilities had been steadily 
diminishing since the 1921 defeat. This anti-KAI majority also wanted the party, 
as such, to participate in wage struggles and economic struggles in general, 
which had, with the ebb of the revolution, come to occupy a preferential place. 
The minority, known as the &#8220;intellectuals&#8221;, rejected this kind of compromise. 
While they were maneuvering to get their line adopted at the March 1922 session 
of the central committee, they were excluded by the Berlin district. The former 
leaders of the party then moved their office to Essen.</p>

<p class="fst">After this, there were two KAPDs, two <i>Communist Workers 
Newspapers</i>, two AAUDs and two <i>Kampfrufs</i> (Call to Struggle), which was 
the organ of the AAUD. The Essen faction regrouped the old leadership and a few 
small districts. The Berlin tendency represented the majority of the KAPD and 
the Berlin district in particular: the latter would survive longer than any 
other district. Its membership was also much more working class than the other 
districts.</p>

<p class="fst">For the Essen tendency, building the KAI was its only activity. 
Having become ill during the time of the factional struggles, Gorter then 
supported the KAI in his pamphlet, <i>The Necessity of Reunifying the KAPD</i>. 
Once the theoretician of the SDP, then of the KAPD, he became the theoretician 
of the KAI, together with Schröder. At an April 1922 conference attended only by 
the KAPD and the Dutch Left, the KAI was founded. This conference adopted the 
KAI &#8220;Guidelines&#8221;.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> The Bulgarian Communist Workers Party, a representative of 
the Russian left communists, a delegate from the KAPD youth group, a 
representative of the Amsterdam group and a delegate from the AAUD also attended 
the second conference (October 1922). Contacts were also established with 
Pankhurst&#8217;s party.</p>

<p class="fst">After September 1921, the Dutch Left formed the Communist Workers 
Party of the Netherlands, but neither Pannekoek, nor Gorter, nor Roland-Holst 
was among its members. When the KAPD split took place in Germany, the Dutch 
party&#8217;s majority opted for the Essen tendency. Its August 1922 Congress voted to 
join the KAI. The Bulgarian party, with its 1,000 members, was undoubtedly the 
strongest party in the KAI. It was linked to AAU districts in four cities. 
Strongly influenced by the KAPD schism, it also split into a Varna tendency 
(analogous to the Berlin tendency) and a Sophia tendency (analogous to that of 
Essen). The latter rapidly broke up, and, paradoxically, it was the Varna 
tendency which attended the Second Congress of the KAI. In Russia, the KAI was 
represented by a much-reduced group, the Revolutionary Workers Opposition, which 
was illegal and distributed KAPD propaganda. Despite the hopes of the Germans, 
the Bulgarian Communist Workers Party did not thrive, and soon disappeared. 
Pankhurst had to content herself with sending greetings to the Second Congress. 
After the Third and last Congress (November 1924), the KAI existed merely as an 
idea periodically propagated by an office staff.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a><sup style="font-size: 80%">-</sup><a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">The AAUD-E</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The AAUD-E spawned numerous factions. Until 1925, its leadership 
was in the hands of Rühle, Pfempfert and J. Broh (who had left the USPD). There 
were many expressionist artists on the editorial committees of <i>Die Aktion</i> 
and <i>Die Einheitsfront</i> (the United Front), the main journal of the AAUD-E. 
One tendency wanted to unite with the FAUD. Another wanted to participate in 
wage struggles and the elections for the legal works councils&#8212;this faction was 
excluded. Another tendency, the so-called Heidenau or &#8220;smokestack autonomy&#8221; 
tendency, defended absolute autonomy. Finally, the &#8220;council communist&#8221; or 
&#8220;centralist&#8221; tendency fought to make the resolutions approved by the AAUD-E&#8217;s 
Congress compulsory for all the organization&#8217;s members.</p>

<p class="fst">The latter tendency emerged victorious and made the AAUD-E into 
an organization which was no longer opposed to the KAPD and the AAUD on the 
issue of &#8220;organizational principles&#8221;. The efforts of the Berlin KAPD to achieve 
reunification were rejected until 1925. The Heidenau tendency moved in 1923 
towards resolutely anti-organizational positions of principle, mixed with 
anti-intellectualism: it dissolved itself in December 1923.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;All organizations pursue their own survival. The united front of 
all the creators cannot be realized in the factories and in the countryside 
unless the organizations rid themselves of all their defining characteristics, 
since they smuggle the bacillus of schism and therefore the absence of unity 
into the workers movement with their programs, their leaders and their factory 
walls. They constitute an obstacle to progress. The comrades of Heidenau have 
arrived at the necessary conclusions and, first of all, destroy their own 
organization.&#8221;<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">K. Guttmann, a member of the AAUD-E, declared: &#8220;In the German 
proletariat, whatever does not teach organization is not revolutionary&#8221; (<i>Los 
von Moskau!</i>, published by the AAUD-E of Hamburg).<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1925, Rühle, judging that the reaction was too powerful to 
justify the continuation of revolutionary activity, resigned from the AAUD-E. 
According to the historians of the GDR,<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> he rejoined the SPD. This seems 
quite improbable, especially since these <i>Documents</i> from East Germany do 
not document Rühle&#8217;s departure from the AAUD-E. In addition, he was to continue 
to make theoretical contributions within the left tradition.</p>

<p class="fst">The AAUD-E joined two other groups in 1926 to form the Spartacus 
League of Left Communist Organizations (or &#8220;Spartacus No. 2&#8221;) under the 
patronage of Pfempfert and <i>Die Aktion</i>. The other two groups in this 
organization were the Industrial Union of Transport Workers and Ivan Katz&#8217;s 
group, which had recently been excluded from the KPD for &#8220;Trotskyism&#8221;. This 
fusion earned the ridicule of the KAPD, but the Berlin tendency would do the 
same thing a few months later (cf. below). Despite this cartel of organizations, 
the AAUD-E&#8217;s membership was falling towards zero, and had no more than 31 
members when it fused with the AAUD in 1931 to rejoin the KAPD.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">The KAPD (Essen tendency)</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The Essen tendency was at first the weakest of the KAPD 
organizations. In 1923, a tendency concentrated in Leipzig, the Council 
Communist League, broke with the Essen tendency, and also moved towards 
anti-organizational and anti-leadership positions of principle. It moved closer 
to the Heidenau tendency of the AAUD-E. J. Borchardt (cf. Chapter 4) had already 
arrived at such a position at the war&#8217;s end. Such attitudes were also to be 
encountered in the FAUD&#8217;s <i>Die Schöpfung</i> tendency; the FAUD&#8217;s 
anarchosyndicalist leadership reproached this tendency for its &#8220;individualism&#8221;. 
It was an important current within the German Left. These groups and individuals 
felt the need to theorize their withdrawal from the &#8220;life of the militant&#8221;, 
which the working class base of the leftist organizations had accomplished 
without having posed any philosophical problems. Principled anti-intellectualism 
is a problem for intellectuals. Similarly, the principled rejection of any 
organization is also the inverted expression of what Luxemburg called 
&#8220;organizational cretinism&#8221; (yet without understanding it: cf. Chapter 4). It was 
Schröder, himself a lawyer and a KAPD leader, who set the tone at the August 
1920 KAPD Conference: &#8220;Something very important has come up in the debate: the 
proletarian instinct to feel that it is necessary to free ourselves from the 
intellectuals.&#8221; (This may be an allusion to Rühle, whom the Congress had 
decided, however, not to exclude). It is this instinct which issues the warning: 
&#8220;Don&#8217;t take advantage of us! Think of the millions of dead sacrificed for the 
slogans of the leaders! And under no circumstance are you to take advantage of 
us in the interests of any kind of theory!&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Two years later, these statements would return to haunt Schröder 
and his comrades: they would be accused of playing a role within the 
revolutionary organizations which could not even be attempted within the 
bourgeois parties.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The idea that knowledge is superior to all the other 
manifestations and functions of human life has a basis which is easily explained 
by historical materialism: the development of mechanical thinking within the 
capitalist economic form. Accounting and calculation, which only present 
knowledge, have become vital laws for the capitalist economic form, which are 
reflected in the spiritual life of bourgeois society through the glorification 
of the intellect, of knowledge&#8221; (<i>Die Revolution</i>, journal of the Heidenau 
tendency, No. 20, 1922).</p>

<p class="fst">It was the rejection of scientism, of the dictatorship of 
theoretical knowledge and &#8220;consciousness&#8221; (preceding action) which is brought by 
knowledge and science, as this latter trend was manifested in the socialist 
movement (Kautsky): but this rejection would in effect be based upon the 
framework of a false opposition between intellect and spontaneity.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1925, the principle leaders of the Essen tendency (Schröder, 
Reichenbach, and Goldstein) returned to the SPD. Others, like Sachs, abandoned 
all political activity. The timing of this exodus, which coincided with Rühle&#8217;s 
departure from the AAUD-E, can be explained by the repression of leftist 
organizations and the KPD after the conclusion of the 1923 crisis, from which 
neither the KAPD nor the AAUD would recover. Furthermore, for all those who 
still wanted to &#8220;be political&#8221;, the KPD, in the midst of &#8220;Bolshevization&#8221;, was 
not the ideal location. The Red Combatants group (<i>Die Roten Kämpfer</i>) 
carried out agitation within the SPD: after 1923, it went underground and 
undertook resistance activities. Its members were arrested and imprisoned in 
1936. After the war, Schröder unsuccessfully attempted to form a leftist group. 
We should also note that at the same time that Schröder and his friends returned 
to the SPD, the SPD (which was in power in Prussia) forced the AAUD and the KAPD 
into a long-anticipated clandestinity. Gorter, meanwhile, died in 1927. The <i>
Communist Workers Newspaper</i> (Essen tendency) appeared regularly until 1929, 
and was largely dedicated to a critique of the reformism of its fraternal groups 
on the left.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">The KAPD (Berlin tendency)</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Together with the Berlin AAUD, the Berlin KAPD was the most 
working-class of all the surviving left groups. Its leadership was for the most 
part anonymous. It was, in brief, more activist than the other groups, launching 
numerous calls for insurrection in 1923, but it was also non-existent outside 
Berlin.</p>

<p class="fst">The Fifth Congress of the KAPD (Berlin tendency) elaborated a 
Second Program which was more detailed than the first. It attempted, in 
particular, to provide more depth to the idea of the &#8220;death crisis&#8221; of 
capitalism, which had until then remained more or less just a slogan. During the 
groupuscular phase, this idea was converted into a pseudo-theory to justify the 
organizations&#8217; continued existence, since the &#8220;death crisis&#8221; was linked to the 
immanent resumption of the movement. This notion, however, had remained 
relatively unchanged since the war. In their attempt to theorize a bold new 
formulation of the death crisis, the Berlin KAPists relied on Luxemburg. They 
conceived of the crisis as a crisis of the market, which found all the outlets 
it needed in neither wars, nor in growing state demand. This conception was 
shared by all the left currents during this period, with the exception of a 
small minority which formed in 1924 within the Berlin group, as well as a few 
Dutch leftists close to Pannekoek, <i>who had already attacked this thesis prior 
to the war</i> (cf. Chapter 3). These elements were to comprise the nucleus of 
the future Dutch GIKH and of the KAU in Germany.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1926, the &#8220;grenade affair&#8221; took place, as well as the schism 
of the Berlin KAPD. The English press had revealed that the Russians were 
contributing to German rearmament, offering Germany the use of training camps on 
Russian soil. The SPD took advantage of the scandal to attack the KPD. The KAPD 
called attention to the affair by publishing <i>From Revolution to 
Counterrevolution: Russia Arms the Reichswehr</i> (Berlin, 1927). The KAPD found 
itself in agreement with a recently-excluded KPD faction (E. Schwach and K. 
Korsch).<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> Schwach, who was a parliamentary deputy, participated in the 
campaign by denouncing the collusion between the &#8220;Soviet&#8221; and German 
governments. He formed the group called the &#8220;Determined Left&#8221; (<i>Entschiedene 
Linke</i>), which eventually fused with the KAPD-Berlin, after having lost most 
of its members. This merger posed some delicate problems, because Schwach did 
not want to resign his seat in parliament.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> The KAPD rank and file, who had 
not been consulted throughout this affair, underwent a schism, which led to the 
creation of two new press organs: <i>Kommunistische Arbeiter</i> (the Communist 
Worker), <i>Organ der KAPD-Opposition</i>, and <i>Klassenfront, Organ der 
AAUD-Opposition</i>. They denounced the opportunist parliamentarism of the 
leadership, which accused the opposition of being manipulated by the Dutch (a 
small group which split from the Dutch Communist Party and whose theses had some 
influence on part of the Berlin KAPD; see below).</p>

<p class="fst">Although part of this opposition returned to the party in 1928, 
the wound was healed only by means of an extreme weakening of the organization, 
since their return coincided with the departure of the AAUD-Opposition tendency. 
After 1928, this KAPD tendency was no longer any more important than its Essen 
counterpart. One of its members, Weiland, was arrested in 1933 for having been 
in contact with Marinus Van der Lubbe, the Reichstag arsonist (cf. below). Other 
members of the KAPD formed clandestine resistance groups after 1933, the 
&#8220;Revolutionary Shop Stewards&#8221; and the &#8220;Group of International Socialists&#8221;, which 
still existed in Berlin after 1945. They published the journal <i>Neues Beginn</i> 
(New Beginning) in Berlin from 1945 to 1950. They were involved with the journal <i>
Funken</i> during the 1950s, and published <i>From the Bottom Up, Pages for 
Direct Democracy</i> in Berlin.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h6">The AAUD (Berlin tendency) and the KAUD</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The AAUD-Berlin underwent a schism at its Seventh Conference in 
1927, when the majority declared their support for participation in the partial 
struggles of the working class, the sole proviso being that the workers 
themselves must conduct the struggles. The AAUD urged its members to form 
&#8220;action committees&#8221; in the factories to prepare wildcat strikes. For the first 
time in its history it would therefore conduct an economic struggle: the 
struggle of the North Sea fisherman in 1927. The theses of the Eighth Conference 
also no longer spoke of the need for a separate party, and consequently for the 
KAPD, undoubtedly as a result of the Schwach affair. A little later the AAUD 
declared that it would henceforth assume the tasks of the KAPD. Thus, there was 
no longer any principled opposition to the vestiges of the AAUD-E, which led to 
the creation of the KAUD, into which the two organizations fused: at the moment 
of its founding (Christmas 1931), the KAUD had 343 members. This unification 
took place, in part, on the advice of the GIKH, with which the AAUD had been in 
close contact since 1927. The acronym itself, KAU (Communist Workers Union), 
contrasted with the old name (General Workers Union), indicating that the 
Germans for their part accepted one of the principle conceptions of the GIKH: 
the working class must organize itself, no one can attempt to be the pole of 
this process of self-organization:<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> after 1933 the KAU clandestinely 
distributed the bulletin <i>Rätekorrespondenz</i>, printed with the help of the 
GIKH in Holland, calling upon the radical workers to form communist workers 
groups and to carry on the struggle independently of democratic anti-Nazism.</p>

<p class="fst">During the crucial years 1920-1930, the Netherlands took up the 
torch of council communism. After 1945, however, the remnants of this current 
were relatively strong in central Germany (which became <i>East</i> Germany). 
All the leftists who resumed their activity or who were recognized by the KPD, a 
total of several hundred, were arrested.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> The 1953 workers uprisings in this 
part of Germany assumed the forms of the council movement, in consonance with 
the relative backwardness of East German capital during that era.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h7">Council Communism in the Netherlands</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The Dutch Communist Workers Party subsisted until the 1930s, 
holding fast to the positions of the KAPD-Essen. A small minority, however, 
including H. Canne Meijer (with whom Pannekoek sympathized) broke with the party 
due to the issues of the death crisis and day-to-day practice. This group, which 
represented only a few individuals, established contacts with some members of 
the Berlin tendencies of the KAPD and AAUD. In 1927 it set up a Press Service of 
the International Communists. In 1930 the AAUD published a text composed by the 
GIKH: <i>The Fundamentals of Communist Production and Distribution</i>,<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> one 
of the basic texts of the councilist left.</p>

<p class="fst">The essential idea of the text is that the &#8220;communist economy&#8221;, 
like any other, needs an accounting unit to respond to society&#8217;s needs without 
resorting to commercial accounting and economic regulation by way of the law of 
value. This unit is social average labor time. This thesis takes it for granted 
that communism will still have an <i>economy</i>, and that average social labor 
time would be a measure on a par with the liter or the kilogram. The theory has 
the merit of posing the question of <i>communism</i>; but, by introducing the 
general accounting unit&#8212;a unit of average labor time not determined by the 
market&#8212;it preserves the value relation, the general equivalent, even though it 
destroys its apparent forms: money, etc. Communism, however, as Bordiga was 
alone in repeating for many years, is the supersession of all kinds of 
commercial value; if this kind of value must be counted, it is in physical 
quantities, but not in order to quantify and regulate an exchange which no 
longer exists.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Dutch leftists, however, had reinvented a thesis which had 
already been criticized by Marx in his critique of Proudhon.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> The idea of a 
conscious and <i>direct</i> calculation of abstract average labor time, without 
passing through the mediation of money, is foreign to the communist perspective, 
which eventually only counts in physical quantities (in the fullest sense of the 
term).<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The GIKH was quite consistent and became very influential, since 
it had the merit, in comparison to the remnants of the KAPD, of not wanting to 
&#8220;make the revolution&#8221;, and devoted its efforts to small tasks imposed by 
reality. Just as the Dutch Left had initially possessed a more accurate 
perception of reality than the Germans, who were attached to the illusion of 
action (SPD, etc.), the Dutch councilists, after 1930, also had a more realistic 
and, ultimately, more effective vision than the vestiges of the movement in 
Germany itself. The GIKH would publish pamphlets by Pannekoek (<i>Lenin as 
Philosopher</i>, for example), a German language journal (<i>Rätekorrespondenz</i>) 
with contributions from people outside its group (Korsch, Mattick&#8212;a former 
KAPist&#8212;Wagner). Its Press Service, in Dutch and German, was replaced in 1938 by <i>
Raden Kommunisme</i>. There was also an organ published in Esperanto:<i> Klas 
Batalo</i>. All of these journals hosted numerous political and theoretical 
debates (cf. Appendix II). In addition, the GIKH &#8220;intervened without 
intervening&#8221; in everyday struggles, somewhat like the ICO in France after the 
war (cf. below).</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h8">The Reichstag Fire</a></h3>

<p class="fst">There was also a much more workerist group in Holland during this 
period: the <i>Linksche Arbeideroppositie</i>, which had been excluded from 
Sneevliet&#8217;s semi-Trotskyist Revolutionary Socialist Party, whose organ was the 
journal <i>Spartacus</i>. This group, in the person of one of its members, Van 
der Lubbe, seems to have had to its credit the burning of the Reichstag in 
February of 1933. In any event, the group applauded this action and claimed Van 
der Lubbe as one of its own. Under the name of the International Van der Lubbe 
Committee,<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> the group published a <i>Red Book</i> (in response to the <i>
Brown Book</i> published in Basel by &#8220;fellow-travelers&#8221; of the USSR in 1933). 
This book explains that this symbolic critique of parliamentarism (which was 
actually a symbol of such a critique, however powerful the act) was intended to 
make an impression on the German workers, and to convince them that the struggle 
against National Socialism would never succeed on the terrain of parliament. The 
GIKH energetically rejected all such methods.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> The <i>Linksche 
Arbeideroppositie</i> later published the journal <i>De Arbeidersraad</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The numerous small councilist groups of the 1930s went into 
hiding at the time of the German invasion. In 1940, however, Sneevliet created 
the Marx-Lenin-Luxemburg Front, with the journal <i>Spartacus</i>, &#8220;Organ of the 
Third Front&#8221;, which was joined by many former members of the GIKH. When Germany 
attacked the USSR in June of 1941, the MLL Front majority rejected &#8220;any defense 
of the USSR&#8221;. When the leaders of the Front were arrested in 1942, and eight of 
them were executed, the council communists abandoned this organization and 
joined the <i>Communistenbond Spartacus</i>, rejecting any kind of collaboration 
with either side in the conflict, since both merely represented different forms 
of the rule of capital. This group still contained ex-trotskyists who had not 
freed themselves from the virus of activism, which led to a new split in 1947, 
when the leadership decided to create a new version of the AAU, at a time when 
no revolutionary factory organizations actually existed. What remained of the 
Spartacus <i>Bond</i> experienced the same phenomenon in 1964: the anti-activist 
minority founded the journal <i>Daad en Gedachte</i> (Action and Thought), to 
which C. Brendel contributed.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h9">Developments in Bulgaria</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Although there is a paucity of information on the subject, it was 
in this country that the leftist movement (of the German type) was actually 
strongest. In June of 1923, Stamboulisky (cf. Chapter 17) was overthrown by a 
military coup d&#8217;état. The Bulgarian Communist Party assessed the situation in 
accordance with the Russian experience of February-October 1917, and fully 
assimilated this military coup with the Kornilov affair. Rejecting the united 
front &#8220;from above&#8221; with the Peasants Union, it remained neutral in the face of 
what it assessed to be two equally bourgeois camps. The Communist International 
was aware of this and urged the Bulgarians to change course, and not to follow 
this &#8220;leftist&#8221; orientation but to launch an insurrection, which failed, in 
September. In this instance the anarchists played an important role. In the end, 
the cities had been less involved than the countryside. Considering the army&#8217;s 
weakness (reduced to 20,000 men by the postwar treaties), the Bulgarian 
Communist Party&#8217;s strategy was by no means absurd: to strike a hard blow in 
Sofia after having dispersed the forces of the State by means of a generalized 
agitation. But this &#8220;offensive&#8221; was also just a putsch like the one in Hamburg 
the following month, although the social base was much more extensive in 
Bulgaria.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The evolution of the Bulgarian groups and tendencies then became 
extremely complicated, but was nonetheless of some significance. N. Sakarov, who 
had abandoned the &#8220;narrows&#8221; in 1908, and was a patriot during the war, led the 
socialists who joined the Communist Party in 1920, presided over the 
parliamentary group of eight Communist Party deputies elected in November of 
1923, and announced at the end of December in parliament that he condemned the 
Communist Party&#8217;s insurrection, and that he was committed to legality.<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> He 
was also against the alliance with the peasants which the Communist Party was 
then implementing. The exiled Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party 
then excluded him. Nonetheless, Sakarov himself published, in November of 1924, 
the first issue of <i>Proletarii</i> as the <i>organ of the Bulgarian section of 
the KAI</i>. According to Rothschild, this journal, which defended Marxist 
principles against the two Internationals, viewed Russia as &#8220;a second variant of 
capitalism&#8221; and insisted upon the opposition between the interests of workers, 
peasants and artisans, and that it would be vain to try to create a united 
front.</p>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile, Ganchev, leader of the Bulgarian Communist Workers 
Party in 1920, who had nevertheless returned to the official Communist Party 
after June of 1923 with a small group of followers, published, with the approval 
of the Communist Party&#8217;s Central Committee, the journal <i>Lach</i> (Starlight: 
always the proletarian <i>Aufklärung</i>) in October 1923. Ganchev wanted to 
facilitate a Sakarov-CP rapprochement and opened the columns of <i>Lach</i> to 
the two currents without initially favoring one or the other. He later grew 
increasingly critical of the Central Committee, without entirely taking 
Sakarov&#8217;s side. He was eventually excluded, and would fall victim to the white 
terror in 1925. The Central Committee emerged victorious, and Sakarov was 
reduced to the leader of a small sect. Some of his supporters, as elsewhere, 
became &#8220;Trotskyists&#8221; (S. Zadgorski, who started in the Bulgarian Communist 
Workers Party and later returned to the Communist Party). The Communist Party 
would have great difficulty in controlling the unexpected adventurist tendencies 
of some of its members, and would not achieve complete control over its 
organization until the mid-1930s.</p>

<p class="fst">Ambiguity and confusion were so characteristic of the Left that 
one cannot easily oppose a &#8220;communist left&#8221; to a degenerate Communist Party. 
Sakarov&#8217;s position (as well as Ganchev&#8217;s to some extent), rejecting a compromise 
with non-working class elements, was, on the one hand, a distorted proletarian 
demand (Gorter had correctly written that the workers stand alone, but he was 
talking about Western Europe). But it was also a direct defense of the interests 
of the working class <i>qua</i> socio-professional category. This position could 
lend itself to integration within a reformism which would pit workers and 
capital against the other social groups.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h10">Other Countries</a></h3>

<p class="fst">We shall only deal briefly with some offshoots of the German 
Left. Issue No. 101 of <i>ICO</i> mentions the existence of groups in Greece, 
Romania, Yugoslavia, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Denmark. In Belgium, prior to 
World War Two, one group published the <i>Bulletin de la Ligue des Communistes 
Internationalistes</i>.<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> There was a Flemish group in Ambers after the 
war.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a> In the United States, Mattick published the journals <i>Council 
Correspondence, Living Marxism</i> and <i>New Essays</i><a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> between 1934 and 
1943. Other German immigrants in Melbourne (Australia) published the <i>Southern 
Advocate for Workers Councils</i> and reprinted Pannekoek&#8217;s postwar book <i>
Workers Councils</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">In France, a group linked to the GIKH published <i>
L&#8217;Internationale</i>.<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a> A &#8220;Spartacus Group&#8221; was formed in Paris in 1931, 
composed of German émigrés (A. Heinrich) and A. Prudhommeaux. This group 
published several issues of <i>L&#8217;Ouvrier Communiste</i> and, later, the journal <i>
Spartacus</i>, propagandizing for the councils and presenting the first 
description of the German council movement to a French audience. This group also 
published the <i>Open Letter to Comrade Lenin</i>, both in its journal as well 
as in pamphlet form.<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The group which founded the ICO at the end of the 1950s came, in 
part, from <i>L&#8217;Internationale</i>.<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> Another, much smaller, group, founded in 
1959 and still in existence, published the bulletin <i>Lutte de classes</i>, 
which is quite workerist but offers profound analyses of capitalism and workers 
struggles.<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a> In this sense it recalls the GIKH. The journal <i>Socialisme ou 
Barbarie</i>, born of a split in the Fourth (Trotskyist) International, which 
rediscovered or re-employed old formulations of the German Left, without 
vindicating themselves by ever clearly mentioning their affiliation with that 
current, succumbed to council fetishism, only to end, in the 1960s, with 
self-management, democracy and group dynamics.<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a> For all of these groups,<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a> 
&#8220;the councils are the parliaments of the working class&#8221;, in accordance with the 
definition provided by Karl Roche, one of the founders of the AAUD in 1919.<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a></p>

the first. The bulletin proclaimed &#8220;the death crisis&#8221; and called upon the 
proletarians to join the KAI. It also outlined an analysis of the development of 
society towards a pyramidal structure which would fuse the classes, anticipating 
the theses of <i>S ou B</i> during the 1960s, and of <i>Invariance</i> during 
the 1970s. It took into account the contacts made in the east.</p>
