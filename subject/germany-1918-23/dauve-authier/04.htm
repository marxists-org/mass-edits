<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="fst">Its welter of initials and its confused relations with 
revolutionary syndicalism should not mislead us into thinking that the AAUD was 
just another group. The AAUD was part of a tendency that shot into prominence at 
the turn of the century with mass strikes which combined &#8220;politics&#8221; and 
&#8220;economics&#8221;, as well as the huge, at times anti-trade union strikes in northern 
Germany in 1913 which gave rise to autonomous committees. In conjunction with 
this trend the idea of the unitary organization was born, the first formulation 
of which appeared in the Bremen <i>Arbeiterpolitik</i>. The left communist 
newspapers, especially the one published by Wolffheim and Laufenberg, never 
ceased to expound its necessity.</p>

<p class="fst">In April-May 1919, the first important <i>union</i>, the General 
Miners Union, was formed by previously unorganized workers together with almost 
all the trade union members in that economic sector, before being dismantled by 
the police. The former members of this <i>union</i> would join the revolutionary 
syndicalists (who were then backpedaling in respect to the rest of the movement) 
or the AAUD; others would return to their old trade unions. The Port and 
Shipyard Workers Union of Hamburg, founded in August 1919, combined a defense of 
immediate interests with the advocacy of certain political perspectives: arming 
the workers, a critique of the Spartacist leadership of the KPD, and active 
solidarity with the Russian Revolution. The AAU of the Ruhr was formed at the 
same time on a similar basis.</p>

<p class="fst">The founding congress of the AAUD took place in February 1920. 
The first spokesmen of unionism, who were at that time already deeply involved 
in their national-bolshevism (which attracted a small minority within the AAUD), 
were sidelined. One debate dominated the congress: must the party-form be 
abandoned as soon as possible (the position defended by Roche, of Hamburg), or 
should it be at least provisionally maintained (the position defended by 
Schröder and the leadership of the future KAPD)?</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD would be tempted to treat the <i>unionen</i> as its 
working class base. Pannekoek criticized the practice which transformed them 
into &#8220;factory groups&#8221; instead of &#8220;workers groups&#8221;. Since the future, he said, 
lies in the neighborhood and city soviets, in the councils which embrace and 
transcend the workplace, what good is a <i>union</i> which is nothing but an 
extended version of the party?<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> His criticism was justified, but in its 
essentials, from the time of its founding, the AAUD was not a branch of the 
KAPD. In the winter of 1920-1921 the AAUD alone had some 150,000 members (while 
the KAPD had about 40,000). It was the most active <i>union</i>. It regularly 
published a dozen weeklies and its numerous pamphlets occasionally had print 
runs of up to 120,000 copies. It would lose almost all of its members after 
1923.</p>

<h2>Program of the AAUD</h2>

<p class="fst">1. The AAUD fights for the class unity of the proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">2. Its goal is a classless society, the first phase of which is 
the dictatorship of the proletariat, thatis, the will of the proletariat alone 
determining the political and economic organization of society in its entirety, 
thanks to the organization of the councils.</p>

<p class="fst">3. The progressive realization of the council idea is the road 
which the growth of the self-consciousness of the proletarian class is taking. 
The dictators, properly speaking, are the delegates of the councils; these 
delegates must carry out the decisions of the councils. The councils<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> can be 
recalled at any time by the rank and file which bestowed their mandates. There 
is no place for so-called leaders except as advisors.</p>

<p class="fst">4. The AAUD rejects all reformist and opportunist methods of 
struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">5. The AAUD is against any participation in parliamentarism, 
since that would mean sabotage of the council idea.</p>

<p class="fst">6. Likewise, the AAUD rejects all participation in the legal 
enterprise councils as dangerous class collaboration with the employers.</p>

<p class="fst">7. The AAUD is opposed to trade unionism because the latter is 
opposed to the council idea.</p>

<p class="fst">8. But the AAUD is particularly opposed in the most violent 
possible manner to the trade unions because they are the principal obstacles to 
the continuation of the proletarian revolution in Germany. They are the 
principal obstacles standing in the way of the unification of the proletariat as 
a class.</p>

<p class="fst">9. The goal of the AAUD is unitary organization. All of its 
efforts will be directed towards the attainment of this goal. Without admitting 
the justification for the existence of political parties (since historical 
development impels towards their dissolution), the AAUD does not fight against 
the political organization of the KAPD, whose goals and methods of struggle are 
also those of the AAUD, and strives to move forward alongside the KAPD in the 
revolutionary struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">10. The mission of the AAUD is to carry out the revolution in the 
workplace. It takes the political and economic education of the workers 
seriously.</p>

<p class="fst">11. During the phase of the conquest of political power, the 
Factory Organization becomes a link in the proletarian dictatorship exercised in 
the workplace by the factory councils, which is founded upon the Factory 
Organization. The purpose of the Factory Organization is to assure that 
political power is always and exclusively exercised by the executive council.</p>

called the Factory Organization.</p>
