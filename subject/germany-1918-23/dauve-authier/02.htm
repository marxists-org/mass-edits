<h1>The Communist Left and the Resolutions<br>
of the Second Congress<br>
of the Communist International<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></h1>
<hr>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<p class="fst">The consequences of the decisions reached in Moscow are more 
complicated for the left communist groups. The fact that the new demands for 
international centralization and discipline cannot be separated from the 
decisions concerning parliament and the trade unions has led to an unfortunate 
outcome, giving the impression that one part of the radical camp is against the 
formation of a solid international association.</p>

<p class="fst">Only one of the left groups, the Austrian communist group, has 
immediately confirmed its appreciation for the great value of such an 
association. Revoking its decision to boycott the elections, which had been 
proclaimed shortly before the congress, in order to participate in very 
unfavorable conditions in the electoral campaign, it has provided an example of 
international discipline of a kind never seen in the old movement.</p>

<p class="fst">In my view, it seems unjust and inappropriate to joke about this 
act of the Austrian comrades by calling them &#8220;Mamelukes&#8221;, as the <i>
Arbeiter-Zeitung</i><a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> has done. However anti-parliamentary one may be, one can 
and, according to my criteria, one must appreciate the sacrifice such an act 
implies. The Austrian comrades are not necessarily puppets of Moscow who are 
blindly following orders. They could also be men who enjoy an interior freedom, 
who do not serve the lifeless word, but the cause, who do not fail to see the 
greater truth hidden behind a smaller one. They are convinced that the question 
of whether or not to participate in the elections is secondary, and that the 
primary question is this: international unity and international discipline.</p>

<p class="fst">An entirely different question, however, is whether the negative 
experiences in respect to participation in parliamentary elections, most 
recently suffered by the Austrian communists, and last summer by the Germans,<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> 
do not cast doubt upon the consequences of a discipline which obliges 
parties in the Third International to act against their own better judgment and 
intuition. Does the Austrian failure not prove that grudging obedience to a 
directive, without enthusiastic conviction, not only fails to reinforce the 
revolution but actually retards its progress? Is this failure not a sign that it 
is desirable and necessary to give the member parties freedom of action in 
certain cases and within certain limits, and precisely in those cases where the 
conscious and active part of the working class either demands or rejects a 
particular course of action?</p>

<p class="fst">In his pamphlet on left wing infantilism, while addressing the 
issue of parliamentarism, Lenin has brilliantly reminded us of the danger of 
lethargy, which inevitably arises periodically in extreme left wing tendencies 
and constitutes their negative aspect. He explained to all radicals that only by 
remaining in close and continuous contact with the masses can this danger can be 
avoided, and in this respect he has done all of us a great favor. And he has 
personally convinced us that it is folly for the communists to refuse to 
participate in bourgeois institutions or non-revolutionary workers 
organizations, out of fear of weakness or corruption; the construction of the 
institutions of the new society will not be possible without confronting similar 
and even more serious dangers. Lenin has not presented any proofs, however&#8212;and 
neither he nor anyone else can present such proofs&#8212;that the communists of 
Western Europe must participate in parliamentary elections in defiance of the 
intuitive rejection of such elections by the revolutionary vanguard. All the 
examples he adduces from the practice of the Bolsheviks prove nothing. All of 
these examples refer to a phase in the development of the world revolution which 
we have left behind, and which will never return for any proletariat. The world 
war and the Russian revolution have contributed new elements to the course of 
events; the mentality of the masses, and even more so, the mentality of their 
vanguard, have changed.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> One of the symptoms of this change is the rejection 
by part of the revolutionary workers of the corrupted and disgraced parliament, 
which is profoundly hated and despised. What has taken place in Germany and 
Austria will probably be repeated in England and France, should the communists 
in those countries also participate in parliamentary elections. Over the long 
term, Pannekoek will be vindicated against Lenin, and the international 
resolution on parliamentarism will have to be revised at a future congress.</p>

<p class="fst">Based on what we have read in certain declarations in the <i>
Workers Dreadnought</i>,<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> the English anti-parliamentary left communists will 
follow the example of the Austrian comrades, that is, they will place more value 
on organizational unity at the national and international levels, than on the 
defense of their opinions on particular issues. Now that the Labour Party has 
refused to admit communist organizations, the most important bone of contention 
separating the right and left wings of the English communist movement has 
disappeared, and I think the Pankhurst group&#8217;s position is tactically correct, 
which consists of advocating unification with the old BSP (now the CP). It would 
be idiotic to preserve the current fragmentation of forces, solely and 
exclusively because of the antiparliamentarism of a small group: a party cannot 
have an essentially negative purpose for its existence, without falling into 
lethargy and situating itself outside of the masses. However, the task of Sylvia 
Pankhurst&#8217;s brave and dedicated group will be far from finished, once formal 
organizational unity is established. Since it is likely that the moderate wing 
of the English CP, with its strong predilection for parliamentarism, will be 
predominant, it will be the task of Pankhurst&#8217;s group to be the revolutionary 
conscience of the party and to ceaselessly defend the new concepts concerning 
the role of the masses as the creative element in the revolution. In this way it 
will also help preserve the spirit of the Shop-Stewards Movement, and will help 
that movement grow stronger as well. The relative and absolute small size of the 
communist groups in England, as well as the lack of a strong apparatus of 
bureaucratic power and influential leaders in the old BSP make it more probable 
that organizational unity for the communists of this country is the best option, 
so as to provide the fresh, young and radical elements who are least prejudiced 
by the old concepts with an influence on the growth of the movement. The 
precondition for this&#8212;and this is very important&#8212;is that they preserve their 
independence of spirit, and do not allow themselves to be deprived of the right 
to criticize both the national and international leaderships.</p>

<p class="fst">In contrast to what is taking place in England, in Germany it is 
not very likely that the left communist opposition can now fulfill its task 
within a unified party. The most important, although not the only reason for 
this, is that the question of the relation between communism and the trade 
unions in Germany has assumed a very different form than in England. In England, 
the new spirit which wants to dispossess the leadership of decision-making power 
over the struggle and its development, in order to place that power in the hands 
of the organized masses, has found a way to create its own organs within the 
trade unions: a practical solution, characteristic of the manner in which ways 
of life are changed in England. In Germany, with its much more rigid concepts 
and its arrogant fanaticism of power in all walks of life, such a thing has not 
yet been possible. The radical communist opposition considers the renovation of 
the trade unions from within to be impossible, and believes that it can attain 
its objective only by means of the general workers federations, the so-called 
&#8220;unions&#8221;. There is thus a conflict with the official communist party, which for 
the time being appears to be insurmountable.</p>

<p class="fst">The political isolation of the extreme left implies great dangers 
for the latter, although, fortunately, there are plenty of opportunities these 
days to prevent a loss of contact with the masses. It is, furthermore, precisely 
its independence which allows the KAPD to freely propagate its ideas and to 
transform them into reality, without being paralyzed by the requirements of a 
dogmatic and authoritarian party discipline. Whatever forms they assume, 
depending on the specific situation, all the radical leftist groups everywhere 
represent essentially the same tendencies. The idea that only the energy, the 
initiative, the heroism and the dedication of the masses can make the revolution 
a reality, has not only been theoretically understood by these groups; they want 
to transform this idea into the soul of all organization and all action, they 
want to bring this idea to the consciousness of the working class masses.</p>

<p class="fst">This idea, of course, is not always a steady and luminous beacon 
held aloft by the left radicals. Their beacon is often overshadowed by multiple 
errors; the groups which are attracted to this beacon are often searching, 
looking for direction, making mistakes, and faltering, because they abandoned 
the old well-traveled roads. To this we must also add that extremes normally 
attract adventurers of the spirit: undesired episodes frequently result.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD has persistently sought theoretical understanding, i.e., 
the truth concerning the question of which road to follow for the liberation of 
the proletariat. It has had to expel dubious and confused elements from its 
ranks, and is undergoing a continuous process of maturation and increasing 
awareness. It has made mistakes, but its errors were never the result of the 
indecisiveness of a party bureaucracy still in thrall to antiquated concepts. It 
did not vacillate during the days of the &#8220;Kapp Putsch&#8221;; nor did it vacillate 
when it seemed for a moment that the soviet armies were only a few days from the 
gates of Warsaw, it did not hesitate when paralyzing the transport of arms and 
munitions to eastern Europe became a matter of the utmost importance for the 
Russian and international revolutions. Because of its faith in the mission of 
the masses, and the masses&#8217; power to fulfill that mission, the KAPD now 
represents the future. The KAPD acknowledges the necessity of party 
centralization, as long as this is understood to mean unity founded on basic 
principles, and on the will to translate these principles, regardless of the 
circumstances, into guidelines for action, rather than on the absolutism of a 
handful of leaders. It recognizes the great value of the party in the 
revolutionary struggle, and the task it must fulfill, which is to be the 
political center of the will and the thought of the working class. It rejects 
with equal fervor, however, both the idea of the dictatorship of the party over 
the masses, and the idea of the dictatorship of the party&#8217;s leaders over its 
militants. The KAPD has undergone various changes, it has overcome enough false 
and erroneous concepts, and most of the truths which it has discovered are 
proven and authentic, precisely because it has discovered them by means of its 
own efforts, and has not accepted them as a result of a ruling passed down from 
above. This gives it a power which few parties outside of Russia possess.</p>

<p class="fst">The Moscow accords concerning the tasks of the communist parties 
are still founded upon the old division of men into two species: an elite 
minority which thinks, decides and acts on behalf of all, and a large obedient 
herd. This division has dominated the past, and many reasons could be adduced to 
cast doubt on whether it will ever disappear. But the most important task of 
socialism is to overcome this situation as much as possible, by educating the 
masses to undertake their own inquiries, to make their own judgments, to act on 
their own behalf, that is, to organize their own affairs. This impulse, which in 
the soviet system is still expressed in an incipient and incomplete manner, 
exists in the groups of the extreme left as a powerful and conscious will. 
Especially for this reason, these groups are the bearers of a new development: 
they cannot be expelled from the International without the latter suffering a 
loss of strength and foreclosing future prospects. In this respect, Sorel&#8217;s 
broadly applicable and profound judgment is completely valid, according to which 
it is better for the proletariat to temporarily content itself with weak and 
chaotic organizations, rather than to submit to associations which are 
imitations of the political forms of the bourgeoisie.</p>

<p class="fst">Our general conclusion is as follows:</p>

<p class="fst">As long as the objective and subjective conditions for revolution 
in the various countries continue to be as divergent as they are today, 
international discipline and centralization, as sought by Moscow, can only be 
realized in a limited manner. The Moscow accord on organization is very 
valuable, however. It is one of those regulatory ideas which, in all those 
countries where the revolution is still only a possibility and where the power 
of the past is still strong, and the force of the future is still weak, are 
useful and necessary, as counterweights against an exaggerated national 
particularism and as a means of socialist education.</p>

<p class="fst">In our western world, where bourgeois ideology, the idea of 
bourgeois freedom, has affected all classes, it is of the utmost importance to 
learn to renounce personal desires, aspirations, habits, and concepts which are 
contrary to common activity and common struggle. An education following the 
Russian example is therefore necessary for all western communists.</p>

<p class="fst">But while that is true, it is also true that the more highly 
developed individuality of the western proletarians, their greater need for 
intellectual independence and the personal and collective self-determination of 
their destinies, could be a corrective against the excessive inclination to 
accept the country, the people, the past, the experiences and actions of the 
Russians as models for the international movement. History never repeats itself, 
life&#8217;s current never flows backwards, and its power continually creates new and 
distinct forms. The conditions amidst which the Russian revolution began and 
then triumphed will never exist again in the same way in other countries, in the 
entire world outside of Russia. And this is also why the relation between 
leaders and simple comrades, or the relation between party and masses, which 
arose in Russia as consequences of its particular situation, will not be 
repeated outside of Russia. Everywhere, the revolution encounters other 
situations, other conditions, and other human material, which must be worked and 
molded in accordance with other circumstances. The proletariat can learn a great 
deal from the Russian revolution; blindly following it is impossible. 
Everywhere, the current must find its own channel.</p>

<p class="fst">The example, the authority and the leadership of a brave, 
conscious, committed and selfless vanguard in the epoch of transition from 
capitalism to communism are indispensable for a successful conclusion to the 
proletarian struggle against its external enemies and, perhaps to an even 
greater extent, against the enemy within, that is, its own defects, greed and 
egoism. The penultimate achievement of revolutionary development will be the 
disappearance of the distinction between leaders and followers. While this 
division still exists, the masses will not have attained self-determination and 
self-government, they will continue to be more the object than the subject of 
history.</p>

<p class="fst">We do not wish to delve into the question of whether the 
disappearance of this division between leaders and followers can take place in 
the manner foreseen by the Moscow accords, that is, through the progressive 
dissolution of the communist party into the masses, or the masses into the 
party. This would undoubtedly constitute a painless transition to the 
self-liberation of the masses. But history seldom works in such pleasant ways, 
and one must fear that it will not do so in this case, either. It is more likely 
that the communist party will not willingly abandon its tutelage over the 
masses, even when it will no longer be necessary. The masses might have to rebel 
against this tutelage in order to impose their total self-determination. But 
this historical possibility must not prevent the communists from fulfilling 
their task in the present epoch. This task is: to lead the masses to where they 
will no longer need the example and the leadership of a specially organized 
group, of a political-spiritual aristocracy; to render themselves unnecessary. 
The communists labor in order to prepare for their own disappearance.</p>
