<h3>June 1921</h3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="fst">Unionism was the result and the agent of a revolutionary dynamic 
which was unstable and precarious in 1919, and faltering in 1920. When the only 
possible kind of activity was reformist, the (obviously antagonistic) 
coexistence of capital and labor, and therefore also the trade union 
organization with its separation of trades and factories, of employed and 
unemployed, made a comeback. No longer the instrument of a struggle which had 
since come to an end, the AAU was reduced to the status of an appendage of the 
KAPD, which for its part soon broke up into groupuscules.</p>

<p class="fst">After Rühle&#8217;s exclusion (October 1920), the East Saxony district 
of the KAPD dissolved into the AAUD. Some time later, the Hamburg district of 
the AAUD excluded those of its members who wanted to remain in the KAPD. All 
over Germany, a part of the leftist ranks passed over to the &#8220;unitary&#8221; 
organization. The proponents of the latter were particularly enraged by the 
KAPD&#8217;s party politics during the March Action. On October 21, 1921, the movement 
held its first autonomous conference and assumed the name AAU-<i>Einheitsorganisation</i> 
(&#8220;AAU-Unitary Organization&#8221;). It was able to present itself as the authentic 
continuation of the AAUD since the latter had proposed the unitary organization 
as one of its goals. It had 13 economic districts and more than 50,000 members, 
uniting the bulk of those militants who had abandoned the party. The crisis 
within the KAPD and the unions under its influence played a part in swelling the 
AAU-E&#8217;s membership to 60,000 in 1922, versus the AAUD&#8217;s 12,000.</p>

<p class="fst">Despite its proletarian base, the AAU-E, rich in tendencies and 
conflicts, did not enroll workers alone. Intellectuals and artists 
enthusiastically participated in its activities, and <i>Die Aktion</i> was, in 
fact, its most important journal. Rühle left the AAU-E in 1925, judging that the 
weight of reaction was too powerful for militant activity to have any meaning. 
Although Pannekoek was not an active member of any group after 1920, the AAU-E 
could legitimately lay claim to embodying his positions to a significant extent.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAUD (the Communist Workers Union of Germany) would be 
founded upon the principle of the unitary organization in 1931, regrouping the 
vestiges of the German communist left.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2>Guidelines of the AAU-E</h2>
<p class="fst">1. The AAUD is the unitary political and economic organization of 
the revolutionary proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">2. The AAUD fights for communism, for the socialization of the 
production of raw materials, the means of production, and the forces of 
production, as well as of the consumption goods which are the products of those 
forces. The AAUD wants to establish production and distribution according to a 
plan, which would do away with the current capitalist mode of production and 
distribution.</p>

<p class="fst">3. The final goal of the AAUD is a society where all power will 
be abolished, and the road to this society passes by way of the dictatorship of 
the proletariat, which is the exclusive determination of the political and 
economic organization of communist society by the will of the workers, thanks to 
the council organization.</p>

<p class="fst">4. The most urgent tasks of the AAUD are: a) the destruction of 
the trade unions and the political parties, the principle obstacles standing in 
the way of the unification of the proletarian class and the further progress of 
the social revolution, which can be the affair of neither the party nor the 
trade unions; b) achieving the unity of the revolutionary proletariat in the 
factories, the cells of production and the foundations of the society of the 
future. The form assumed by this unity is the Factory Organization; c) the 
development of the self-consciousness and the solidarity of the workers; d) the 
preparation of all measures which will be needed for the work of political and 
economic construction.</p>

<p class="fst">5. The AAUD rejects all reformist and opportunist methods of 
struggle, and is opposed to any participation in parliamentarism and the local 
enterprise councils; such participation would be tantamount to sabotage of the 
council idea.</p>

<p class="fst">6. The AAUD fundamentally rejects all professional leaders. Its 
only relation with official leadership will take an advisory form.</p>

<p class="fst">7. All positions in the AAUD are unpaid.</p>

<p class="fst">8. The AAUD does not consider the proletariat&#8217;s struggle for 
freedom to be a national, but an international affair. For this reason the AAUD 
strives for the unity of the entire world proletariat in a council 
International.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1]</a> These theses comprised one of two projects proposed by the 
opposition within the AAUD. They were presented by the East Saxony and Hamburg 
districts at the Fourth Conference of the AAUD (June 1920), were adopted as 
definitive &#8220;guidelines&#8221; by the first autonomous conference of the opposition in 
October, and were published in <i>Die Aktion</i> No. 41/21, 1921.</p>
