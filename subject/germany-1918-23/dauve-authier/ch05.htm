<h3><a name="h1">Prior to November 9</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The revolution began among the sailors of the German fleet at 
Kiel, the major Baltic port. They had mutinied during the summer of 1917 and 
were crushed: some were imprisoned, others executed. Like the workers, they 
organized their revolt through revolutionary shop stewards. They had established 
contact with the USPD Local (Dittmann), which then disavowed them during the 
repression of their summer 1917 revolt. They had also been in contact with the 
workers at the Kiel shipyard and the arsenal. At the end of October 1918, the 
High Command of the German Navy decided upon one last battle. The sailors 
refused to set sail and seized the ships, and later took over the city. A 
workers and sailors council was formed which took control of the city on 
November 4.</p>

<p class="fst">Their attitude and program were quite pacifist: peace, democracy 
and recognition of the workers. This was the program of all the councils which 
were born in that first phase. They took the form of the Russian workers and 
soldiers soviets. They were based on cities, neighborhoods or the various 
military units. Their form was unlike that of the enterprise or factory 
councils.</p>

<p class="fst">The Kiel council, with an SPD majority, elected Noske as its 
president, the same person who would later be called the &#8220;bloodhound&#8221; of the 
revolution; dispatched to the scene by the SPD leadership, he also took control 
of the local city government. This fact alone summarizes the whole period: the 
rebellion chose as its representative the man who had come to squelch it, and he 
would promptly organize its armed repression.</p>

<p class="fst">This tactic of the SPD proved to be more suitable under the 
circumstances than the one advocated by the government minister from the 
Catholic <i>Zentrum</i> Party, Erzberger, who proposed that Kiel should be 
militarily assaulted, but could find no one to carry out such a plan. This same 
Erzberger, who had presented the motion in favor of peace adopted by the 
Reichstag in July of 1917, would later be assassinated by the extreme right in 
1920, at a time when the revolutionaries had other things to attend to than 
killing ministers: the good democratic souls of the &#8220;workers parties&#8221; would, of 
course, utilize the occasion to criticize the sectarianism of the &#8220;leftists&#8221; who 
refused to participate in the insipid campaigns in defense of legality, which is 
an internal affair of the bourgeoisie.</p>

<p class="fst">The revolution rapidly spread throughout the whole country, 
taking Hamburg and Lübeck on November 5. A general strike broke out in Hamburg 
after the Kiel revolt.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> Huge crowds seized warships, the port, the trade union 
headquarters, the central rail station, and the barracks of the city&#8217;s regiment 
(after a gunfight that led to some casualties), and then armed themselves, 
without taking any further steps. The senate (the local city administration) and 
the council mutually recognized one another and functioned (or, more accurately, 
failed to function) alongside each other: it was by no means a situation of <i>
dual power</i>. Instead of dealing with real problems (food, production in the 
interests of the population and the revolution, armaments, links with the 
outside), the council organized elections ... for the workers and soldiers 
councils, which would cost them three days to prepare. After having seized 
power, the council immediately relinquished it, seeking legitimacy instead. The 
president of the council was H. Laufenberg. The council proclaimed &#8220;the 
indissoluble unity of the Russia of the Soviets and the government of the 
Hamburg councils.&#8221; According to Laufenberg, it was the movement in Hamburg which 
transformed the Kiel revolt into a pan-German phenomenon, which spread to Bremen 
(where the ISD exercised a great deal of influence), Stuttgart (the first party 
section to split from the SPD), and later, on the seventh, to Munich.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> The 
demonstrators in Munich proclaimed the Bavarian council republic and freed all 
political prisoners. At that time, when the councils were just being formed, 
this council republic appeared to be copied from the &#8220;council-republic&#8221; of 
Russia. Its president was Kurt Eisner (USPD).</p>

<p class="fst">Unlike the precedence of Paris in French revolutionary history, 
Berlin fell, under pressure from all the rest of Germany, on the ninth: a 
&#8220;division&#8221; of revolutionary sailors (the <i>Volksmarinedivision</i>) arrived 
from Kiel and demonstrators occupied all public buildings. Under the direct 
democratic pressure of the crowds, the republic was proclaimed by the SPD 
minister, Scheidemann. Ebert reproached him for such an undemocratic act, since 
a republic can only be proclaimed by a constituent assembly elected by the 
people. Scheidemann responded that, had he not done so, the demonstrators would 
have immediately rallied to Liebknecht. An entirely Social Democratic government 
was created, called the &#8220;Council of Peoples Commissars&#8221;, composed of three 
members of the SPD (Ebert, Scheidemann, Landsberg) and three from the USPD 
(Haase, Dittmann, Barth). Due to his popularity, Liebknecht had been approached, 
but had refused to participate: at the head of another demonstration, Liebknecht 
proclaimed the socialist republic.</p>

<p class="fst">Approximately 10,000 councils were established, electing leaders 
who were in their great majority members of the SPD. Both the leaders of the SPD 
as well as the Army encouraged this process and helped to form councils: &#8220;All 
power to the Councils&#8221;. The council was the form chosen to liquidate the 
subversive movement, from the very moment of its appearance. The &#8220;council-form&#8221; 
is no less a failure than the &#8220;party-form&#8221;. Yet, even today, in imitation of the 
Leninists, councilists speak of the council as if it <i>must</i> always be a <i>
revolutionary</i> council, while the latter constituted an exception within the 
German Revolution. The Leninists speak the same way about the &#8220;revolutionary 
party&#8221;, as if it were a magical talisman, despite the fact that it has never 
existed. These disputes concerning party or council are of no account because 
they have always lacked and will continue to lack any real historical substance.</p>

<p class="fst">The November Revolution took place in a totally unexpected manner 
for all the parties and groups which attempted to assume its leadership, 
including, among others, those who were closest to the rank and file, the <i>RO</i>, 
whose plan for an insurrection was rendered superfluous by the wave which spread 
from Kiel. But the social democracy knew perfectly well how to use this current 
in its favor, and was all the more pleased when it conformed to its desires. 
When social democracy took the power which the proletariat had granted it, and 
which the bourgeoisie was prudent enough to surrender to it, the democratic 
revolution was already over. The emperor had abdicated after nobody spoke of him 
anymore. The struggle against the social revolution was initiated and led by the 
&#8220;most powerful workers party in the world&#8221; and its peoples commissars, in the 
name of democracy, the councils and socialism. One of the dangers of democracy 
is that it preys upon the need to transform our surroundings and of acting in 
common; a need which is frustrated by capital, which organizes everything 
according to its own logic, and reduces us to an infantile state in which the 
isolated individual receives the means to live without producing them. Democracy 
is an attempt to simultaneously overcome this isolation and this passivity. The 
contemporaries of the German Revolution had perceived this quite well. In 1921, 
W. Roemer explained the advantages of the council system in the following terms:<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> 
in other times the worker had no other opportunities for political activity 
than that which took place through a political party and through voting in 
elections, while from now on he participates directly thanks to the council.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">The strategies and functions of the various organizations</a></h3>

<p class="fst">As far as the bourgeoisie was concerned, the State was 
momentarily neutralized. Nowhere did the bureaucracy offer any resistance to the 
formation of councils which, although concentrating all power in their hands 
wherever they were established, left the old State intact, and demanded that the 
latter &#8220;recognize&#8221; them. The Army dissolved, although its officers managed its 
return to Germany in a more or less orderly and disciplined fashion. There was 
little fraternization with enemy soldiers. The soldiers who were not immediately 
reincorporated into civilian life formed councils throughout the country at all 
levels, from the barracks up to the army corps. They were mostly social 
democrats, but were utterly useless as a force for direct repression: their 
purpose was more to immobilize the movement, so as to make it expire from 
inactivity. Some officers attempted to reestablish the status quo in the Army 
but could only create the <i>Freikorps</i>, paramilitary formations led by 
officers and <i>government employees</i>. The bourgeoisie and its parties did 
not take any overt action and ceded political power. Under pressure, their 
parties changed their names; all of them introduced the word &#8220;peoples&#8217;&#8221; or 
&#8220;popular&#8221; into their titles.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> Liberalism was weak in Germany: the bourgeoisie 
was not very unified. In 1918, it was not economically destroyed, but 
surrendered political power to the workers parties. Once again, under the Nazi 
regime, the bourgeoisie would not itself exercise political power, and Hitler 
was able to say: &#8220;I do the politics, you do the economy&#8221;.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> Immediately after 
the First World War, the bourgeoisie was divided between republicans and 
monarchists, those who benefited from inflation and those harmed by it, etc. 
...<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The SPD which had taken power had undergone a large reduction in 
its membership, which was in its eyes a sign of proletarian radicalization, 
although the masses allowed it to remain in power. Once it occupied the highest 
offices of the State, its membership as well as its audience rapidly expanded: 
it obtained 35% of the vote in the January 1919 elections. It was the &#8220;backbone 
of the new bourgeois State&#8221; (Wolffheim).</p>

<p class="fst">Although it had been formed by those who had been excluded from 
the SPD, the USPD never lost the hope of reunification. Since its leaders were 
primarily concerned with the exercise of power, they did not consider the 
possibility of assembling a council as the Spartacist left had desired. Having 
taken account of the obvious current of radicalization, Spartacus had to show 
that it had at least become a significant minority within the USPD. We must 
point out that &#8220;public opinion&#8221;, the press, etc., had at that time seized upon 
the term &#8220;Spartacist&#8221; as being more suitable than &#8220;left radicals&#8221;, 
&#8220;international socialists&#8221;, etc., for causing a sensation, and that the term was 
applied to the whole revolutionary movement, within which Spartacus was just one 
group among others, and which would constitute neither the majority nor the most 
radical current within the KPD. The term &#8220;left radical&#8221; was also used in an 
imprecise manner, designating not only the USPD left (without distinction) but 
also everything to the left of the USPD.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">On October 7, 1918, the Spartacists, as an autonomous group, 
convoked a national conference, to which they invited the groups of the ISD as 
observers. This conference launched the slogan, which had already been heard in 
certain places during 1917-1918, calling for the formation of councils 
everywhere following the Russian model. It adopted a democratic transitional 
revolutionary program which was presented as follows: ending the state of 
emergency, liberation of all political prisoners, expropriation of the banks, 
heavy industry and the mines, as well as of large and medium-size agricultural 
properties, and the completion of <i>German unification</i>. This last point was 
in conflict with Wilson&#8217;s &#8220;right of self-determination&#8221;, which was devised to 
weaken Europe and strengthen the United States, and to give rise to buffer 
States against the revolution. The conference refused to deal with the trade 
union question as a &#8220;secondary&#8221; issue, despite the appearance of numerous 
autonomous organizations in the factories.</p>

<p class="fst">Freed by the government at the end of October, Liebknecht met 
with the Berlin shop stewards, who elected him to their leadership along with 
Müller (ISD). Luxemburg, who was also imprisoned during the war, was freed by 
the revolution on December 9. On that same day, Spartacus published the first 
issue of its daily newspaper, <i>Rote Fahne</i> (<i>The Red Flag</i>), the 
future organ of the KPD, the right wing KPD and the VKPD. On the 18<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, 
it became the &#8220;Spartacist League&#8221;, thereby demonstrating its movement towards 
autonomy in respect to the USPD.</p>

<p class="fst">Like Spartacus, the ISD also grew and multiplied the number of 
its publications: some of them would become the organs of the left wing which 
would be excluded from the KPD. On November 23, meeting in Bremen, the ISD would 
assume the name IKD: <i>Internationale Kommunisten Deutschlands</i>. This would 
be one of the names proposed at the founding congress of the KPD. Laufenberg and 
Wolffheim&#8217;s organization joined the IKD, which also led the Bremen council. In 
Berlin, a member of the IKD (Müller) was elected leader of the shop stewards. On 
December 1, the IKD of Saxony, with Rühle, held its founding congress: after a 
week of experiences it had withdrawn from all the councils dominated by SPD and 
USPD members. These groups would attend the national conference of the IKD on 
December 24 (see the next Chapter). After November, the IKD declared its full 
solidarity with the struggles and the slogans of the Spartacists and, together 
with the latter, proclaimed the watchword: &#8220;All power to the councils&#8221;. However, 
as could be deduced from the press and attitude of the Saxon IKD, the IKD, from 
its inception, unlike the Spartacists, judged that the workers and soldiers 
councils, so recently created, the products of a still confused movement, could 
not be the vehicles for the proletarian revolution. On this point the IKD was 
not the victim of a fetishism of the organization and the <i>masses</i>. It put 
forth as a specific task the clarification of the relation of forces throughout 
the country and, taken as a whole, played a much less well-known but more 
important role than Spartacus.</p>

<p class="fst">On a national scale, the revolutionary shop stewards seemed to 
constitute the trade union left. As such, they corresponded exactly to the USPD 
(following the old economic-political dichotomy which the revolution would try 
to overcome). The <i>RO</i> was ultimately the trade union organization of the 
USPD. It fully confirmed this tendency by providing itself with a trade unionist 
leadership: Ledebour, Däumig (both from the USPD) and Müller (of the Berlin shop 
stewards). Even after the revolution, the <i>RO</i> would still allow a place 
for the USPD. In Berlin, however, where the Spartacist tendency of the USPD was 
strongest, the <i>RO</i> elaborated the insurrectionary plan which would be 
short-circuited by the revolution itself.</p>

<p class="fst">On January 1, 1919, the <i>RO</i> refused to become the KPD&#8217;s 
economic organization, and requested, among other things, that the party abandon 
the provocative name of &#8220;Spartacus&#8221;.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> As an expression of its 
radical-reformist base, the <i>RO</i> would be replaced during the struggles of 
early 1919 by the factory organizations and action committees, the precursors of 
the future AAU. After the end of 1918, left wing action committees existed in 
all of Hamburg&#8217;s factories.</p>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile, the anarchosyndicalists, although outlawed and reduced 
to inactivity during the war, had preserved their cadres. The Free Federation of 
German Trade Unions (FVDG) rapidly rebuilt its organization. During December 
26-27 it held a conference and, most importantly, decided to invite its members 
to collaborate with the communist organizations (IKD) and the Spartacists, in 
support of the councils and the dictatorship of the proletariat.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The &#8220;November Revolution&#8221; was not even a bourgeois revolution: 
ultimately, it was the political conclusion, carried out by the proletariat, of 
a bourgeois revolution which started in the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century. This 
&#8220;revolution&#8221; was not a revolution: it did not fight the essence of the State, 
which was only modified in a secondary manner. Eichhorn, a USPD member, who was 
appointed &#8220;chief of police&#8221; of Berlin, was by no means the real chief of police. 
And what kind of police was he supposed to lead? The police of the bourgeois 
state had not changed. The mere fact that the workers and the revolutionaries 
had mobilized in its defense was more than symbolic: it reflected the 
incompetence of the movement. To speak of the &#8220;German Revolution&#8221;, granting this 
term its most profound meaning, as Luxemburg did in her last article (January 
14, 1919), is a dangerous illusion.</p>
