<p class="fst">If Trotsky was correct when he wrote, in 1922, that &#8220;in 1919, the 
European bourgeoisie was completely disconcerted&#8221;,<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> before recovering its 
strength in 1920 and 1921, it is equally true that 1919 was the decisive year 
when a combination of violence and democracy allowed it to resist a proletariat 
which was restive yet, despite appearances, had not taken the <i>offensive</i>. 
The period between May 1919 and March 1920 was not characterized by great 
battles in Germany. The proletarians were still burdened by the crushing weight 
of the defeat they suffered in the war. In June, hunger riots broke out in 
Hamburg which could not be contained by the <i>Volkswehr</i>.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> The <i>
Freikorps</i> repressed the riots, but its units were immediately disarmed. The <i>
Reichswehr</i> intervened and occupied the city from June to December. Order was 
essentially reestablished by a &#8220;Committee of Twelve&#8221; which claimed to represent 
the factory councils, the unemployed and the <i>Volkswehr</i> units under the 
control of the councils. On the 25<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> of June, this Committee issued a 
call to &#8220;watch out for agitators and help the police&#8221;. The masses took to the 
streets to oppose the refurbished rule of military force: it was not that they 
wanted to radically transform their living conditions; their aversion to the 
Army was an aversion for a particularly concentrated and symbolic form of 
oppression, but they did not attack it at its roots.</p>

<p class="fst">A state of siege reigned everywhere and imposed clandestine 
conditions upon the revolutionary groups. It was during these few months that 
important splits took place and that the new &#8220;leftist&#8221; organizations were 
formed.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">Hungary</a></h3>

<p class="fst">On the international plane, Hungary offered the only example, 
besides Russia, of a revolutionary seizure of power. But the Hungarian 
experience provides an additional illustration of the communists being defeated 
due to their involvement with socialists. Founded in November 1918, the 
Communist Party only &#8220;seized&#8221; power thanks to the collapse of the State. After 
proclaiming the republic, the prime minister resigned to protest the armistice 
terms imposed on his defeated country. The communist leader, B. Kun, replaced 
him as head of state, and joined the socialists who were already members of the 
government.</p>

<p class="fst">There were not two socialist parties in Hungary, but only one, 
which cloaked itself in leftist garb when the possibility of coming to power 
appeared to be at hand. The resolution of the national question was a bloody 
affair: conflicts broke out between Hungary and its neighbors concerning the 
frontiers established by the peace treaties. The new, independent Hungary still 
possessed regions inhabited by non-Hungarian populations (Germans, Slovaks, 
etc.); the counterrevolution exploited these differences and Hungary was invaded 
by Romanian and Czech troops allied with Hungarian counterrevolutionary forces. 
Isolated in the capital and surrounded by hostile peasants, the council republic 
was overthrown: the socialists then abandoned the communists during the ensuing 
repression.</p>

<p class="fst">The least that could be said about them was that the Hungarian 
revolutionaries, inspired by the Communist International, persevered in their 
illusions. In the first issue of the <i>Communist International</i> (May 1919), 
L. Rudas wrote that &#8220;the entire socialist party&#8221; had recognized &#8220;the necessity 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat. And now, the proletariat stands as one 
man behind the new socialist party.&#8221; The social democracy had previously 
participated in the government after Hungary&#8217;s secession (November 1918), and 
had reached an agreement with the communist party. When the socialist head of 
state resigned, the socialists would <i>remain</i> in the government in which 
Bela Kun had replaced the prime minister. A curious dictatorship of the 
proletariat. Like other revolutionaries, the Bolsheviks were mistaken when they 
spoke of a &#8220;revolution&#8221;. They forgot the essential criterion: the destruction of 
the State. The State had not been overthrown.</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin admitted that he had forgotten about the depth of the 
Hungarian revolutionary movement: but a telephone conversation reassured him; in 
this socialist-communist unity, he said, only the left socialists<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> 
participated. On May 27 he wrote that &#8220;in the matter of organization, the 
Hungarian proletariat seems to have outdone us&#8221;. He thought that its 
organization would allow it to avoid the massive use of violence which was 
necessary in Russia: &#8220;you have set a better example than Russia, because you 
have known how to win over all the socialists, from the start, to a program of 
true proletarian dictatorship.&#8221;<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> In other words, it was a centrist phenomenon, 
already seen in relation to the USPD, with one difference, that in Hungary the 
USPD and the SPD were the same entity. Lenin was following the disastrous line 
which he would partially apply to Germany when he advised the KPD to unite with 
the USPD left. The Bolsheviks were in favor of the reunification of the old 
workers movement, only purged of its right wing elements. Those communists who 
would be only momentarily inclined towards the left (cf. Chapter 17) would not 
make this decisive critique of the Communist International. The future right 
wing leader of the KPD, Levi, who was more lucid because of his moderation,<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> 
denounced the putschist and artificial tendency of this &#8220;soviet republic&#8221;. He 
had already discussed (in relation to Levine) the problem of communist 
participation in struggles which were condemned to failure, and Radek had 
implicitly attacked him, speaking of &#8220;political philosophers&#8221; who did not want 
to fight unless they had a &#8220;certificate of guaranteed victory&#8221;.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> Lenin thought 
that &#8220;the Hungarian revolution might play a greater historical role than the 
Russian revolution.&#8221;<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> A highly advanced country in the heart of Europe, 
Hungary enjoyed a strategic position. But while the Communist International, led 
by Zinoviev, boasted of victory, Lenin was more circumspect and pressed B. Kun 
to work with firmness. The situation of the Red Army, attacked on several 
fronts, did not allow for military aid to Hungary, which the latter had desired.</p>

<p class="fst">The Communist International misunderstood the Hungarian 
experience. It saw, above all, the power of the socialists, first in order to 
combat them (1919), but then (after 1920) in order to conclude with the need to 
attract them to communism: hence the schisms which were proposed in the 
leaderships of the old socialist parties, the united front and the conquest of 
the trade unions. On this last point, however, after the bourgeois defeat, more 
praise was bestowed upon the opposition. Roudniansky stated<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> that in Hungary 
one had to act outside of the &#8220;professional unions&#8221;: &#8220;not because the 
professional unions are generally incapable of bringing the class struggle to a 
favorable conclusion, but because the Hungarian professional unions are 
penetrated with the bourgeois spirit and opportunism, because ... they in fact 
constitute the vanguard of the counterrevolution.&#8221; He rejected the trade unions 
in the name of Hungarian specificity, and only in this particular case. The 
structure of the unified socialist party (which took the name &#8220;socialist&#8221; under 
trade union pressure) was, on the other hand, modeled on the basis of the 
factory organizations. A member of the socialist party was also a member of the 
trade unions. Only 10% of party members had entered the party <i>directly</i>. A 
note from Zinoviev demanded that the editorial committee of the Communist 
International must not share Roudniansky&#8217;s opinion: the revolution &#8220;gives new 
life to the trade union movement ... making it one of the points of support for 
the dictatorship of the proletariat.&#8221; And he would return to this theme in June 
of 1920<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a>: &#8220;A great movement has begun among the old trade unions. The trade 
unions are no longer what they were five years ago. One could say the same about 
the American Federation of Labor. In Germany, the replacement of the old 
bureaucrats has begun and is being pursued with vigor.&#8221; This development 
corresponded to a re-adaptation of the trade unions to the <i>same</i> 
(reactionary) function, and not to a change of function: but the CI needed to 
invent a movement in the trade unions like that of the &#8220;left-leaning&#8221; centrists 
in order to incite the communists to collaboration.</p>

<p class="fst">In January of 1921, two Hungarians, Kabatchiev and Rakosi (future 
leader of Stalinist Hungary prior to 1956), CI delegates to the Livorno 
Congress, where the Italian Communist Party was founded, explained that the 
error of the Hungarian communists must not be repeated.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> They explicitly 
compared the two cases, deducing from the first that one must break with the 
socialist center as well as with the right (in Italy, with Serrati). &#8220;The 
reasons which impelled them (the Hungarian communists) towards unity are the 
same ones which are today used on behalf of the reformists and centrists in 
Livorno. They, too, yielded to the sentimental fraction of the working class 
which wanted just one party. The Hungarian communists had also postponed the 
exclusion of the reformists, expecting that they would provide them with the 
pretext for justifying their expulsion in the eyes of the backward masses... 
None of their hopes were realized.&#8221; They also warned against the trade 
unionists, recalling the Finnish and Bavarian cases. Levi, who was also present 
at Livorno, defended the unity thesis and later regretted the outcome of the 
Congress (cf. Chapter 13). The international communist movement only learned 
half the lessons of the Hungarian experience.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">The Treaty of Versailles</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In June of 1919, the Weimar assembly accepted the conditions of 
the Versailles Treaty: the property of the Saar Basin mines was seized and the 
entire left bank of the Rhine (facing the Ruhr) was occupied. Germany lost its 
colonies and had to pay an enormous debt (primarily to France) whose exact 
amount was not yet established: in the meantime it had to pay 20 billion gold 
marks in reparations. In May of 1921, the debt would be fixed at 132 billion 
gold marks: in contrast, France&#8217;s debt to Germany after 1871 was 3 billion gold 
francs.</p>

<p class="fst">The treaty signified an enormous transfer of surplus value from 
Germany to the victors, and consequently aggravated the exploitation of the 
German proletariat. The treaty was an attempt to divide the world proletariat, 
by ensuring that the costs of economic reconstruction would be borne by the 
German workers alone. All the Communist Parties of the time energetically 
denounced the treaty except the Dutch CP (cf. <i>The Opportunism of the Dutch 
Communist Party</i>, written by Gorter in 1919). In addition, the territorial 
settlements which were adopted at the peace conferences, taken as a whole, 
tended to isolate the Russian and German proletariats. A reconstituted Poland 
was inserted to drive a wedge between the two revolutionary heartlands and took 
over the great industrial region of Upper Silesia. The application of the 
alleged Wilsonian &#8220;idealism&#8221;, &#8220;the right of self-determination&#8221;, divided Europe 
into bits and pieces and laid the groundwork for the world hegemony of the USA.</p>

<p class="fst">The communist parties jointly launched a <i>specific</i> struggle 
against the treaty, whose abrogation they demanded: abrogation was one of the 
principle slogans of the 1920s. Gorter, and along with him the German Left, 
analyzed the treaty as a terrible blow dealt to the proletariat, and not just 
the German proletariat. But it was not a question, for either Gorter or the 
left, of making the treaty&#8217;s abolition into a &#8220;partial demand&#8221;: since it found 
itself facing an agreement between capitalist states, the proletariat, in any 
event, had nothing to say, unless it accepted the terms of debate and sought the 
lesser evil within the framework of the system of capitalist States (in the same 
way that antifascism would seek the least unfavorable capitalist formula for the 
proletariat, within the system of bourgeois political powers). It is a kind of 
false realism to believe that the proletariat could have some impact on facts 
whose very existence implies that the proletariat has not played a historical 
role. The revolutionaries had no more reason to zealously demand the abolition 
of the treaty than to demand the disarming of the police. The fact that these 
slogans were launched proved the invisibility of the proletariat as a class 
power, and its effort to find a substitute for that power by indirect means. The 
proletarians had not been invited to have an influence on the relations between 
States: should such a thing occur, they would be integrated into one or another 
State. This is what would happen on several occasions during the time of the 
Weimar republic, when the KPD demagogically competed with the Nazis by demanding 
the annulment of the treaty.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">The Establishment of the Weimar Republic</a></h3>

<p class="fst">On August 11, 1919, the Weimar Constitution was born. In December 
of 1919 and January of 1920, agitation for the &#8220;enterprise councils law&#8221; took 
place. This law (<i>Betriebsrätegesetz</i>) was a further extension of the <i>
Arbeitsgemeinschaft</i> and the policies initiated during the Sacred Union (<i>Burgfrieden</i>) 
of the war years. In December of 1916, a decree had instituted trade 
union/employer parity committees in all enterprises with more than 50 employees: 
the <i>Arbeitsgemeinschaft</i> reduced this number to 20. After November 18, of 
course, alongside these business-sponsored trade union organs, the ubiquitous 
soviets appeared. The demand of the supporters of these soviets was, basically, 
to be recognized by the new constitution. The First Council Congress refused to 
admit the Spartacists (cf. Chapter 6): the second was just as adamant in its 
refusal to admit the KPD as a whole. This is certainly a measure of the 
revolutionary significance of a slogan like &#8220;All Power to the Workers Councils&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">An article in the constitution promised the integration of the 
councils. On October 9, the law was presented before the Assembly. In the 
view of the USPD and numerous councils&#8212;particularly the clandestine executive 
council (<i>Vollzugsrat</i>) of Berlin&#8212;who wanted &#8220;authentic participation of 
the workers in economic decision-making&#8221; and not simply in matters pertaining to 
the company cafeteria and social events, the law was insufficient. The working 
masses committed themselves to this fight in favor of council participation in 
decision-making, and in December, demonstrations took place in Hamburg and 
Essen. On January 13, &#8220;in order to exert pressure on the deputies&#8221;, 50,000 
people attended a demonstration in front of the Reichstag in Berlin. Troops 
opened fire on the demonstrators and killed forty people: a state of siege was 
declared. On the 18<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, the law was passed. The KPD (at that time, 
only its right wing remained in the party: cf. Chapter 10) criticized the idea 
of these legal councils, but nonetheless, by virtue of its two 
principles&#8212;&#8220;revolutionary parliamentarism&#8221; and &#8220;do not become isolated from the 
masses&#8221;&#8212;joined the demonstrations.</p>
