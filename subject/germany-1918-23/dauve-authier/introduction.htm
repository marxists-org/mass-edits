<h2><a name="h1">Translator&#8217;s Note</a></h2>

<p class="fst">This revised edition of <i>The Communist Left in Germany: 
1918-1921</i> retains the first, historical part of the original volume 
unaltered, with the exception of a few added editorial notes which were 
suggested by Gilles Dauvé. The second part of the book, which contains texts of 
the German Left, has been substantially changed in order to provide selections 
which have not yet, to the best of my knowledge, become available in English 
translation. Pannekoek&#8217;s <i>The Theory of the Collapse of Capitalism</i>, which 
is currently available in English translation at the website, marxists.org, has 
been replaced by several programmatic texts of the German Left and Pfempfert&#8217;s 
response to Lenin&#8217;s <i>Left Wing Communism...</i> In addition, Gilles Dauvé 
authorized the inclusion of an &#8220;Epilogue&#8221; which he wrote in 2004 and which gives 
the reader an idea of how his conceptions regarding the subject matter of this 
book have evolved since it was originally published in 1976.</p>

<h2><a name="h2">Introduction</a></h2>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is not those who fell wrapped in the unfortunate flag of the 
defeated Revolution whom we consider to be fraudulent squanderers of the 
Revolution, but those who afterwards, from their desks of wisdom or from their 
podiums as mentors of the masses, were unable to derive from that sacrifice 
anything more than a few phrases of demagogic admiration, accompanied by a 
defeatist commentary.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="h3">I</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The fact that the Russian Revolution of 1917 was only one aspect 
and one of the effects of a much broader movement, whose center was Germany, is 
presently more readily admitted. This recognition places the Russian experience 
in context. It is no longer possible to conceive of the events in Europe during 
that era in Russian &#8220;Leninist&#8221; terms. One cannot deplore either the <i>
insufficient</i> or the <i>excessive</i> impact of &#8220;Leninism&#8221; on the western 
proletariat, whose practice must be understood on its own terms. The Russian 
influence was real, but it was limited to the accentuation of a complex 
evolution which it had not created. Conversely, it must be shown to what degree 
this evolution affected domestic events in Russia. Writing an international 
history of the revolutionary movement which followed the war of 1914-18 means 
evaluating the contributions of the various countries and regions, which implies 
shifting the focus of attention towards the moment when polarization over the 
miraculous experiences of Russia was at its height. Such a procedure also 
implies the refusal to anchor a &#8220;period&#8221; with well-defined characteristics and 
to explain everything by reference to that &#8220;period&#8221; itself.</p>

<p class="fst">There is no &#8220;particular situation&#8221; with a unique meaning in the 
history of society. Given the &#8220;period&#8221;, or, more precisely, given all the 
elements which directed the revolutionary drama, the revolution failed and had 
to fail. It can be lamented, and we lament it, but it is of no use to evoke the 
Bolshevik-style party or any other <i>deus ex machina</i> for explaining the 
development of an unreal past. It would, however, be just as false, and would 
also misrepresent the period, to replace the consequences of the abstract 
absence of the &#8220;party&#8221; or any other factor with the false plenitude of &#8220;it could 
not have been otherwise&#8221;; this would have been tantamount to negating the 
possibility of revolution. It would be yet more false, obviously, to present 
everything as a function of a necessary failure. We are determinists, of course, 
but determinism is not a historical factor which can intervene &#8220;a posteriori&#8221; in 
the explanation of events.</p>

<p class="fst">Such a procedure would foist a meaning upon even the most radical 
actions which these actions did not in fact possess, and would interpret the 
various revolutionary attempts as simple convulsive motions of capital&#8217;s 
adaptation, as outcomes of economic crises.</p>

<p class="fst">The &#8220;lessons&#8221; of the German Revolution? A historical analysis of 
the revolutionary movement would be interested in, among other things, 
discovering the reasons for the failure of the previous attempts, but not in 
such a way as to derive from the latter a guarantee for future victory. We do 
not consider revolutions as simple &#8220;experiences&#8221;. We discover in them, beyond 
their time, men who live in community with today&#8217;s subversive tendency. And this 
discovery is consolidated by discovering that this tendency has always existed 
and has always occupied the front ranks of the historical stage on various 
occasions. It is not, then, a matter of learning simple &#8220;lessons&#8221; or of 
considering history as a school, but something quite different.</p>

<p class="fst">&#8220;We know only one science: history&#8221;, means that the other 
sciences, based upon &#8220;experience&#8221;, are not sciences at all. The transformation 
of Marxism carried out by its followers, starting at the end of the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> 
century, which made Marxism into a &#8220;science&#8221;, reduced it to one of those 
pseudo-sciences which are not at all subversive of society, in order to 
accommodate to the latter and to seek nothing more than the reproduction of 
particular &#8220;reactions&#8221;; it was a question, for the orthodox Marxists, of 
socializing capital or, expressed differently, of subjecting it to real 
organization and regulation, to prevent some of its annoying effects, thanks to 
their Marxist &#8220;science&#8221; of economic reactions; but they did not speak of 
socialist production, or of socialist economics; they preserved the categories 
of political economy, such as value and all the rest, but forgot the only true 
science: human emancipation. The stance of the <i>proletarian</i> 
revolutionaries was identical with the confrontation with real history as it was 
unfolding. Some, like Gorter, felt quite profoundly that, with the unleashing of 
the world war, the bourgeoisie had dealt an almost irreparable blow to the 
proletariat; that the war meant, in the final analysis, the accession of 
capitalism to world domination (see <i>Imperialism, the World War and Social 
Democracy</i>, 1914); and from that moment (Autumn of 1914) he foresaw that a 
revolution, breaking out after the war as a result of misery, would face nothing 
but difficulties. Just like Marx who, viewing the general situation, had 
&#8220;counseled against&#8221; the insurrection of the Commune, saying that it was 
condemned to failure. Certain individuals in our camp thus possessed the 
elements necessary to predict failure. But this did not prevent Marx, Gorter and 
Pannekoek (who may very well have shared Gorter&#8217;s views) from participating in 
the movement from its very first moments; unlike Luxemburg, they did not apply 
the brakes (see below, for the increasingly negative role played by Luxemburg 
from the beginning of the war); they were present wherever the human community 
was being created, contributing their powers of classification and, while not 
holding back, not feeling the need to offer themselves as sacrificial victims to 
the holocaust, either.</p>

<p class="fst">If events are conceived in the light of their outcomes, all 
proletarian movements could be interpreted as phases of the social system&#8217;s 
self-adaptation. From this perspective, the proletariat has failed up to this 
point, because capital was not sufficiently developed and dominated neither the 
entire world nor life as a whole; today, however, the total rule exercised by 
capital will lead to a rebellion which will be just as total. This vision of a 
finally pure communist revolution to be unleashed against a capitalism which is 
the absolute lord and master of everything skips over the present and past 
contradictions of the movement of capital and the communist movement. 
Furthermore, in order to provide this total rebellion of pure negation with a 
certain coherence, an effort is made to discover some faraway movements 
(obviously despised and falsified by the official &#8220;communist&#8221; movement which 
only knew how to speak of the insufficiency of the productive forces) towards 
the end of discovering within them the &#8220;<i>ne plus ultra</i>&#8221; of the total 
revolution, in comparison with which the Commune, the Russian Revolution, the 
German Revolution, etc., would be mere child&#8217;s play. Peasant uprisings are 
sublimated, while the KAPD is reduced to a transitional step towards the real 
domination of capital.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> This dual movement, which on the one hand looks 
towards the past for truly radical movements, further back into the night of 
time, and on the other hand seeks to &#8220;demystify&#8221; more recent movements (this 
second aspect being a result of the first) only shows that it has &#8220;demystified&#8221; 
the most recent of all revolutionary movements: the future revolution, which is 
to say that it has renounced it.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not from the perspective of an unrealized ideal perfection, 
but, to the contrary, from that of the contradictions within which the 
revolutionary movement of 1917-21 developed, that this history is intended to be 
written. The German Revolution interests us precisely because it is the 
disturbance which, due to its extent and its social-economic background, most 
closely resembles the situations which we may be called upon to confront. The 
problems faced by the German revolutionaries remain, without having been solved 
in practice. Capital has today managed to perfect its new and specific forms of 
domination, forms which it had begun to experiment with in the First World War.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">II</a></h3>

<p class="fst">It is symptomatic that the &#8220;German Revolution&#8221; has long remained 
in oblivion. The revolutionary movement, both within and outside of Germany, has 
been incapable of assimilating its past, particularly the great disturbance and 
rupture which broke out in 1917. Until fifteen years ago, the only serious study 
in French was that of A. and D. Prudhommeaux, <i>Spartacus et la Commune de 
Berlin 1918-19</i>, published in 1949 in the journal <i>Spartacus</i>: this 
study remained relatively unknown for a dozen years until The Old Mole Bookstore 
began to carry the <i>Spartacus</i> journal. C. Meijer&#8217;s text, &#8220;Le mouvement des 
conseils en Allemagne&#8221;, reproduced by <i>Internationalisme</i> in 1945 and later 
distributed by Informations et Correspondances Ouvrières (who republished it as 
a supplement to No. 101 of <i>ICO</i>), had a rather limited distribution. These 
two collections were the work of old left communists. Taken as a whole, however, 
the groups which descended from left communism hardly bothered with the 
clarification of the period spanning 1917 to 1921, preferring instead to 
elaborate later conceptual developments: reflection upon their <i>origins</i> 
would have been equivalent to self-examination concerning the &#8220;ideologization&#8221; 
of their movement. Instead of studying the communist left they preferred to 
recite the opposition between &#8220;council communism&#8221; and &#8220;party communism&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">It is quite surprising that <i>Socialisme ou Barbarie</i>, over 
the course of its 40 issues (1949-65), did not publish even one study, however 
brief, on this theme.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> A whole series of obstacles prevented the comprehension 
of the phenomenon of the communist left. It is known how Stalinism (and Stalin 
himself) rejected &#8220;Luxemburgism&#8221; as an infantile disorder, worthy of sympathy 
but not very strong compared to its &#8220;Bolshevik&#8221; brother. Luxemburg, for her 
part, became for many people the symbol of the German Revolution and the best 
fruit of the movement in the West. The Luxemburg cult has survived not only 
because of the social democrats who remember nothing about her except her 
democratic side (Spartacus, <i>Masses</i>) but also because of the 
revolutionaries who were misinformed concerning the gap which existed between 
Luxemburg and the communist left. The use of the term &#8220;Spartacist&#8221; to designate 
the movement&#8217;s most radical current was based on the simplified version of 
events provided by the bourgeois counterrevolution. The use of this term has 
mystified the history of its time, much as the use of the words &#8220;Marxist&#8221; and 
&#8220;anarchist&#8221;, employed anachronistically, were used to describe positions which 
were incompatible with their original meanings. Retrospection falsifies 
perspective.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> Finally, the Italian communist left, linked to Leninism, by 
interpreting the German Left as a variety of anarchosyndicalism,<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> has sowed 
much confusion, abetted by the remnants of the German Left who were no more 
capable of understanding their own past.</p>

<p class="fst">German historians offer little information about the 
revolutionary movement after 1918. The works of Badia (<i>Histoire de 
l&#8217;Allemagne contemporaine</i> (Ed. Sociales, Vol. 1, on Weimar)) and especially <i>
Le Spartakisme 1914-1919</i> (L&#8217;Arche, 1967), complemented by documents 
collected in <i>Les Spartakistes</i> (Juillard, 1966), are certainly useful. But 
the timeframe covered by Badia&#8217;s works on Spartacism begins in approximately 
August 1914 and ends immediately after the massacre of January 1919; neither the 
movement&#8217;s genesis before the war, nor its later evolution, is mentioned or 
explained. Considered only during the period of 1914-1918 and presented as the 
only radical current, Spartacism is completely falsified in Badia&#8217;s books. Badia 
always minimizes Luxemburg&#8217;s international dimension, while putting her on the 
highest plane in respect to Germany. Rather than a theoretician, he makes her a 
polemicist. His game has two facets: freezing the German Left under the heroic 
figure of &#8220;Rosa&#8221; and not taking her disagreements with Lenin seriously. 
Frölich&#8217;s<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> and Nettl&#8217;s<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> biographies of Luxemburg, in which one finds 
numerous important facts, unfortunately corroborate this tendency to privilege 
Spartacism. The greatest defect in Frölich&#8217;s book is his desire to reconcile 
Luxemburg and Lenin at any cost, and Nettl, despite solid documentation, 
conceals the second stage of her evolution.</p>

<p class="fst">These two works are nonetheless proof of the growing interest in 
the German events. Flechtheim&#8217;s volume on the German Communist Party<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a>, despite 
Weber&#8217;s final contribution which comprises a comparative study of the social 
bases of the SPD and the KPD, is, rather than a history of a social movement, 
the history of an organization. But even this book gives short shrift to the 
communist left. Flechtheim falls into one of the two traps which lie in wait for 
the academic faced with the temptation to write either a <i>political</i> 
history or history <i>plain and simple</i>. The former is centered on the 
institutional expressions of social movements, and results, in the worst cases, 
in considering everything in the light of the evolution of one or another 
political group. The latter, with its preoccupation to avoid dogmatism, 
accumulates facts without any organizing principle. In the case of the 
proletarian workers movements, on the pretext of avoiding a &#8220;totalitarian&#8221; 
conception of history, it privileges a putative spontaneity (preferably not too 
violent or else only violent in the past) over centralized action and 
organization. The first procedure frequently proclaims itself to be Marxist and 
in fact constitutes an institutional theory of class struggle. The second is 
careful to <i>take no position</i> in regard to theoretical communism, it has a 
pretense to being independent and joyfully proclaims itself&#8212;outrageously 
enough&#8212;to be in favor of the formula whereby Marx declared that he was not a 
Marxist. It ignores the movement&#8217;s center of gravity: the passage to communism, 
which is, however, essential; the proletariat can only be victorious by making 
that passage and organizing itself in accordance with that goal.</p>

<p class="fst">The Anglo-Saxon historians,<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> who have often written about 
Germany, denounce &#8220;communist&#8221; totalitarianism, but reason like Stalinists, 
adopting the sub-leninist and bourgeois conception according to which the 
workers were only stirred up by the actions of &#8220;instigators&#8221;, that is, by the 
&#8220;party&#8221;. They attribute to the Communist International (CI) and its sections the 
leadership role which the latter believed in and aspired to perform. The social 
movement, according to these historians, only exists in the form of political 
structures. Its action is only real when it is contained within these 
structures: it cannot be known except by means of the dissemination of 
information from more or less recognized organizations (press, official 
declarations, congresses, meetings, emissaries, etc.). W. Angress, author of a 
documentary study of the period between 1921 and 1923<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a>, focuses not on 
spontaneous movements, but &#8220;on the movement which is organized from without.&#8221; 
His book assiduously follows the KPD and the CI, and briefly Max Hölz, as they 
confront the actions of the government. The Ruhr insurrection of 1920 hardly 
attracts his attention, while he devotes 50 pages to the 1921 &#8220;March Action&#8221; and 
its repercussions. For these historians, insisting on the specificity of the CI 
and Bolshevism was not only an ideological necessity, but a way to frame events 
in accordance with their material interests as specialists, which consists in 
presenting the authorities and the corporations which finance their research 
with a <i>mystery so impenetrable</i> that only the experts (that is, 
themselves) can unravel it. Modern researchers approach the social question in 
the most sophisticated manner: they must make everything very complicated to 
justify the continuation of their labors. One group explores what is alien and 
strange about a different, totalitarian world; the others explore the infinite 
subtleties inherent in the richness of life and spontaneity &#8220;concealed&#8221; by a 
series of &#8220;alienations&#8221; which they have done nothing to demystify.</p>

<p class="fst">Broué&#8217;s monumental work, <i>La révolution en Allemagne 1917-23</i> 
(Minuit, 1972) is an excellent example of a <i>political</i> history. It is 
true, of course, that the author, in a recent article<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a>, denied &#8220;having 
composed a history restricted to the level of the &#8216;leadership-elite&#8217;.&#8221; His 
objective is to study the &#8220;German communists in the light of their form of 
organization, within the framework of their party and their International, a 
framework which they, within that same movement, tried to construct in order to 
be victorious.&#8221; Note his declaration: &#8220;their party&#8221; is, of course, the KPD; 
&#8220;their International&#8221; is the CI. He has thus written a history of the KPD and 
the CI, the latter in the context of its relations with Germany. This leads him 
to a consideration of history based not on the actual events, but on the basis 
of what did not take place at all. His problem can be summarized as measuring 
the impact of the absence of the &#8220;party&#8221;. He bases himself on what did not exist 
in order to understand what did exist. The idealism of his investigation 
ultimately contaminates it to such a degree that he dedicates a disproportionate 
amount of space to facts of quite secondary importance (Radek&#8217;s influence, for 
example). Other historians even went so far as to consider the (French) 
&#8220;ultra-left&#8221; through the lens of police history<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a>.</p>

<p class="fst">Studying the revolutionary events in Germany from the perspective 
of the absence of a truly Bolshevik party is somewhat like studying the human 
digestive tract from the perspective of the mouth and discovering that the cause 
of gastrointestinal illness is the absence of four stomachs in the patient. 
There was a radical difference between the nature of Russian society and that of 
German society in 1917 (see Chapter 1), which can be summarized as follows: 90% 
peasants in Russia, 35% in Germany. In this connection we have elsewhere 
illustrated (see our preface to the translation of Trotsky&#8217;s <i>Rapport de la 
Délegation Siberienne,</i> Spartacus, 1970; see also <i>Nos Tâches Politiques</i>, 
also by Trotsky) how the Bolshevik party was a necessary product of the Russian 
social form and of the ambiguous (proletarian and bourgeois) movement which 
tried to completely change that form. Indigenous attempts to supersede the 
Bolshevik organizational concept in a revolutionary direction were as embryonic 
in Russia as were the indigenous German attempts to install an organizational 
practice which would have been of the same nature as Bolshevism. Germany 
possessed the seeds of a distinct revolutionary party in the KPD until the 
Heidelberg Congress (October 1919), and later in the KAPD and the other leftist 
organizations until the summer of 1921: one can demonstrate in this case what 
did not take place (the KAPD did not become <i>the</i> party of the German 
proletariat constituted as a class), but this explains nothing.</p>

<p class="fst">Broué&#8217;s Trotskyist inclinations lead him to ignore &#8220;leftist&#8221; and 
&#8220;infantile&#8221; organizations and to instead treat the diverse vicissitudes of the 
social democratic left as a communist movement. For our part, it is not a matter 
of opposing our version to a Trotskyist version, or of correcting one 
theoretical con game with another. We declare right from the start that we are 
studying one aspect&#8212;for us, the most important aspect&#8212;of the events in question. 
The reader will understand on his own that he has not read merely the chronicle 
of the &#8220;communist left&#8221;, but that of the epoch&#8217;s most profound social movement. 
Broué has undertaken a partial study with general pretensions: we shall 
undertake a partial study of general interest. One will, of course, find an 
infinite quantity of useful information in Broué&#8217;s book. But its erudition takes 
the form of mystification. Fixated on the theoretical expressions and 
established organizations but not on the contradictory social agitation and its 
more or less articulated manifestations, he devotes himself to the examination 
of parties and trade unions (especially the KPD), scorning to bother with a 
multitude of significant developments. So, how can it be doubted, after having 
perused his impressive bibliography, that he has told the whole truth? The 
method chosen, however, comes with a lie, by omission. His work on Germany 
reminds us of his previous book about the Bolshevik Party (published by Minuit), 
written during the epoch when Stalinist legends were still widely believed. The 
latter volume apparently provides a vast quantity of data. Yet it fails to 
attain the stature of less ambitious but more serious texts from a dual 
perspective: historical and revolutionary. The &#8220;results&#8221; of Broué&#8217;s work are 
situated at the intersection point of the university and contemporary leftism. 
Broué&#8217;s book could be of some use. In the end, however, one will learn less from 
it than one would from the <i>History of the German Army</i> by the 
&#8220;reactionary&#8221; Benoist-Méchin. Despite his anti-Semitic prejudices and his hatred 
of the &#8220;cruel Bolsheviks&#8221;, he views his subject from the point of view of class 
(albeit not our class).<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">From a revolutionary perspective, the volume of selected texts of 
Pannekoek, ably presented by S. Bricianer, has cleared the way and disseminated 
knowledge of the German Left beyond a small circle of initiates.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> A serious 
historical work, it is nonetheless primarily a biography of Pannekoek presented 
through his texts, and devotes few pages to the period 1917-1921, focusing above 
all on the lessons derived from those years by Pannekoek, especially in <i>World 
Revolution and Communist Tactics</i> (1920). This focus, which is perfectly 
legitimate in a work of this kind, ultimately fails to portray the reality of 
that epoch&#8217;s communist movement in Germany, and is dedicated instead to its 
later evolution and Pannekoek&#8217;s retrospective reflections on that period. In 
this respect, Bricianer&#8217;s work, while valuable for the reasons summarized above, 
is not satisfactory. While it is normal for a biography to follow the 
chronological evolution of its subject&#8217;s life and works, theoretical analysis 
demands that one <i>not respect</i> the evolution of his positions, which ends 
in councilism. To conclude with the council (as opposed to the &#8220;party&#8221;) may 
indeed be faithful to Pannekoek&#8217;s thought, but it does not respond to 
revolutionary problems.</p>

<p class="fst">This persistent focus on <i>form</i> (council, party) facilitates 
the current efforts on behalf of capital&#8217;s adaptation, which requires both the 
authoritarianism and regimentation transmitted by the degraded notion of the 
party so dear to the CP and numerous leftists, as well as the workers&#8217; 
pseudo-self-management and the illusory freedom which the idea of the &#8220;council&#8221; 
denotes for other leftists. The concept of self-management is even more 
dangerous when it is stripped of its workerism: &#8220;if (this conception) is to be 
true to its <i>postulates</i>, it must assert that with the evolution of 
capitalism&#8212;which is constantly socializing all human activities&#8212;those 
organizations which are responsible for realizing the principle of councilism 
will have to be located outside of the factories.&#8221;<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> The demand for workers&#8217; 
management refers to the management of <i>everyday life</i>.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> The real <i>
content</i> of the communist movement lies elsewhere and is replaced by 
questions of form.</p>

<p class="fst">Previously denounced, the German Left enjoys a relative celebrity 
today thanks to its most flaccid and well-known aspects. This was only made 
possible by disconnecting its texts from their historical context. As an 
illustration of this tendency, we can be grateful for the work of R. Gombin<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a>, 
who undertakes the task of fusing a series of different and <i>contradictory</i> 
contributions into a whole which is presented as the very trademark of what is 
most radical: but this is only possible after having separated these 
contributions from their respective sources. The essence of modernism consists 
in mixing the most radical aspects of revolutionary thought into an original 
synthesis while these aspects are, however, stripped of what makes, or made 
them, subversive, and taking delight in mere novelty. His secret lies in having 
associated Pannekoek with H. Lefebvre: this monstrous cocktail could only have 
been mixed by carefully erasing the <i>roots</i> of Pannekoek&#8217;s ideas. Evoking 
the mass media in support of this connection would be superficial. Society has 
always fed on revolutionary thought, which, in turn, has also caused the latter 
to become insipid. It was not at all strange when the magazine <i>Minuit</i> 
published an extract from Pannekoek&#8217;s <i>Workers Councils</i> in its seventh 
issue, having selected a section from that work which deals with democracy. But 
the councilist illusions of certain revolutionaries also facilitate this 
absorption, as is demonstrated by the Preface to <i>Workers Councils</i> written 
by former members of the ICO.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> An introduction to the texts of P. Mattick 
situates Sorel among the &#8220;ultra-left&#8221;, alongside the &#8220;socialism of the 
producers&#8221;, &#8220;self-management&#8221; and &#8220;popular self-government&#8221;.<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> The German Left 
defined itself precisely in contradistinction to syndicalism, including the 
&#8220;revolutionary&#8221; variety and, having suffered the effects of reactionary 
violence, did not accept the overabundant and misunderstood myths of the various 
experiences with soviets, councils or workers&#8217; pseudo-autonomy. In 1919 and 
1920, left communists knew quite well that the &#8220;party-form&#8221; had contributed no 
more than the &#8220;council-form&#8221; to the defeat of the revolutionary movement. In any 
event, the publication of <i>Workers Councils</i> signaled the recognition of 
the German Left, in its councilist form, by the intellectual world. The 
&#8220;official daily newspaper of the powerful&#8221; even devoted almost an entire page to 
a good exposition of Pannekoek&#8217;s work.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> Following in the footsteps of Djilas, 
Lukàcs and Garaudy, the German Left, in turn, joined the family of Marxist 
heretics considered to be worthy of notice. An obsession with &#8220;recuperation&#8221; (a 
superficial myth) would be absurd. The fashionable interest in the German Left 
is accompanied by a revolutionary curiosity and a positive concern with 
information and clarification. The phenomenon of vulgarized distortion is 
inevitable. It is precisely this real and new interest which obliges us to set 
the record straight.</p>

<p class="fst">The councilists have done little to shed light on the period of 
1917-1921. But the German Left was one of Bordiga&#8217;s obsessions. It is surprising 
to consider that it was the journal <i>Invariance</i>, descended from the 
Italian Left, which in 1969 first republished a few essential texts, in 
particular almost all of Pannekoek&#8217;s text, <i>Révolution mondiale et tactique 
communiste.</i><a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> A subsequent issue of the same journal is almost entirely 
devoted to the German Left: it comprises a study, both historical and 
theoretical, which heralds the further evolution of the journal, which we shall 
examine in another work currently in progress.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> During the same period, a 
Danish group, also descended from the Italian Left, wrote an original study with 
a particular focus on the unions. A mere fifty pages long, it is one of the 
richest texts on this subject.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> Significantly, it is unfortunately 
little-known. It has been photocopied and distributed on a small scale, and we 
have made ample use of it despite its Leninist vestiges.</p>

<p class="fst">A long article in Number 58 of <i>Programme Communiste</i>, organ 
of the International Communist Party (the &#8220;orthodox&#8221; descendant of Bordigism), 
published in April 1973<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a>, dedicated to reassuring the faithful who remained 
in the ICP after the schism brought about by the sanctions imposed upon the 
Danes and <i>Invariance</i>, who had demanded and practiced &#8220;free inquiry&#8221; 
(particularly in regard to its principle opponent, the German Left), highlights 
the principle points of the German Left&#8217;s defeat. However, whereas the Danes 
consider the German Left as a product of the proletariat, the ICP&#8217;s article is 
primarily a study of the theoretical positions of the various actors, totally 
separated from their contexts (which confirms an absolute bad faith when it is 
compared to the pains Bordiga took to exculpate-explain, by means of endless 
expository forays, the most insignificant&#8212;and the 
not-so-insignificant&#8212;theoretical deviations of Lenin).<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> Proletarian action 
(quite well-perceived elsewhere) is nothing but a backdrop in this article. The 
Left is judged on the basis of its &#8220;principles&#8221; and its adversaries are 
preferred for the rigor of their profession of the Marxist faith.</p>

<p class="fst">A collection edited by one of the authors of the present text, <i>
La Gauche allemande, Textes</i>, reveals a German Left which is much more 
strict, dictatorial and &#8220;party-centered&#8221; than today&#8217;s councilists, as well as 
the image the latter entertain of their progenitor. This collection&#8217;s postscript 
focuses on the involution of <i>council communism to councilism</i>.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a> We 
should also mention a good collection of biographies, recently published in 
French and brought together in one volume by the councilists.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> But this list 
is already out of date.</p>

<p class="fst">Everything we have said up to this point sheds light on our 
method. This work on the German Left is obviously an intellectual work&#8212;and its 
authors are in this case intellectuals&#8212;but, just like other studies of this 
subject, even the most academic, this study is not the fruit of pure intellect, 
of the closed logic of &#8220;research&#8221;; the German Left&#8217;s anti-intellectualist 
critiques were perfectly justified when they attacked the domination of the 
intelligentsia, when they targeted the pretension of a certain kind of 
intellectual of being superior to the rest of mortal mankind, and especially the 
working class &#8220;rank and file&#8221;, when such intellectuals fought for their alleged 
right to lead the movement. Our work has no pretension to autonomy<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a>, which 
for us is not a goal in and of itself; it has no meaning except as part of a 
movement which goes far beyond it. The renascent radical movement must 
appropriate its own history. Nor do we frame what we see in the forms in which 
spoiled intellectuals take pleasure:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Our purpose is not literary or aesthetic production. Comrades 
and readers do not have to waste their time evaluating a passage, a page or a 
text which we publish, but they should always take into account the relation 
between the different parts of the labors undertaken by our small movement...&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb"> (<b>Bordiga</b>, <i>El Programa Comunista</i>, 1953)</p>

<p class="fst">In the following text, the reader will not read the history of 
the German Revolution, or even a reference work on the German Left. Our 
procedure consists in an attempt to extract the leading thread and the essential 
mechanisms from our field of study. We have not hesitated to go over facts 
already studied by others, often in detail, or to rapidly pass over some 
realities which have since become more accessible in more recent works. These 
works are &#8220;points of reference&#8221; for following the history of the left. Another 
kind of approach, which is also useful, would consist in giving more depth to 
the immediate reality of these movements by conducting a study of their everyday 
activities, based, for example, on their press and available archival 
documentation.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not enough to rehabilitate a hidden past. A subversive 
movement has existed, and still exists, whose action and expression have been 
&#8220;hidden&#8221; by official &#8220;discourse&#8221; (state, trade union, bureaucracy, politicians, 
academics, judiciary, schools, etc.). But the simple unveiling of its expression 
is not in itself revolutionary. Its mere expression, that is, the only thing 
that remains of it, is not revolutionary unless it is put to a new use: not 
necessarily in the form of &#8220;action&#8221; in the strict sense of the word, but simply 
as a theory which once again embraces events within its framework. It is of 
little account that a &#8220;liberation&#8221; movement existed long ago: capital placidly 
accepts the reestablishment of the truth concerning Luddism or the German Left 
as long as this changes nothing. The world begins to tremble when the 
revolutionary facts of the past resurface in the practice of a renascent 
subversive movement. Only the dead bury the dead. Fashion and pedagogy (often 
united), on the other hand, take advantage of ideas when they are dead, or in 
the form in which they are no longer alive (councilism, for the German Left). 
Ideas die, too. A theory is dead when the movement which gave it life has 
disappeared, but it can be reborn when a movement arises which is its authentic 
continuation; then, however, it appears in the unpleasant form of a movement of 
&#8220;left fascists&#8221;, &#8220;hooligans&#8221;, &#8220;a society of thieves&#8221;, and other barbarians, like 
those who were called &#8220;Spartacists&#8221; in the epoch which concerns us in this text. <i>
Socialism or Barbarism</i>, ignored when it was subversive, is becoming 
fashionable, now that its old theoreticians (Chaulieu, Lefort and Lyotard) have 
submitted to the rules of the game of modernism.</p>

<p class="fst">Any expression which is not an action, in the sense that it does 
not contribute to the clarification of current revolutionary problems, situates 
itself <i>within</i> capital. It shows that its author has no real need to 
change his situation. The record of the past plays the same ideological role for 
him, one of substitution and illusory excess, which politics plays for others. 
This past could be a future: one could take pleasure in the description of what 
is to come. What contributes to the revolution is neither the evocation of the 
past, nor of the world of the future, but the present effort to connect reality 
to both. It is not our intention to give lessons to historians. They can only be 
what they are. But one can and one must say what they are, and distinguish 
between thought which is merely critical and thought which is revolutionary. It 
is subversive to show how slavery constituted a form of progress for both the 
slaves and for humanity as a whole; it is conservative to restrict oneself to 
denouncing it. The same thing is also true within a mode of production, 
especially when one takes into account the shrewdness and adaptive capabilities 
of capital. Who defends Thiers against the Commune these days? Who reduces the 
War of 1914 to the activities of the Pan-Germanists? In relation, however, to 
anything that still has a direct role to play in the preservation of the social 
order, the issues remain obscure; the war of 1939-45, for example, which proves 
that it is the most important and the most anti-revolutionary war, whose 
consequences are still with us today and which must by all means be preserved. 
This is particularly true of anything which refers to &#8220;fascism&#8221;, where 
clarification is still a threat to the established order, and where 
mystification rules.<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a> There is an abundance of intellectual methods to <i>
avoid</i> such subjects: quantitative and statistical history fit perfectly with 
a &#8220;liberated&#8221; history operating at the level of everyday life, or with a history 
of opinions. One need only consult the catalogue of history journals to see that 
everything is studied, but almost never what is essential.</p>

<p class="fst">To its own misfortune, revolutionary theory plays a double role: 
revolutionary and ... non-revolutionary. By seriously presenting the real 
problems faced by society, it helps society adapt to these problems. The mass 
media <i>accumulate</i> information with the intention of incessantly 
reproducing capitalist relations. How could one not take a position in relation 
to all the critiques, including the most virulent ones, which form part of <i>
capitalist society&#8217;s auto-critique</i>, despite the occasional honesty of their 
authors? Each major capitalist country has its own way of absorbing 
revolutionary theory. In England and the United States, and in Germany in a 
slightly different way, <i>monographs</i> and the fondness for exact empirical 
research are dominant: in Germany, there are numerous monographs on the period 
of 1918-1920, categorized according to region or city. In France, the 
&#8220;theoretical&#8221; current frequently predominates, privileging interpretation, in 
the name of a particular school of thought, over the examination of the facts. 
Theoretical communism met its global downfall, in every country, each with its 
own traditions of thought, not because of useless polemics, but due to the very 
nature of its task. It is obvious that only a rebirth of the movement&#8212;which is 
far from being obvious or automatic&#8212;will limit the inevitable absorption of its 
theory. Meanwhile, the discovery of new theories, bowdlerized versions of 
revolutionary themes which had been developed by the German communist left, 
among others, will not cease. The academic and the political worlds (the worlds 
of dogmatism: Stalinism, for example) will merge and multiply. The goal of 
academic reflection is to pose problems in order to discover other problems, 
just as cars are manufactured so as to be hauled to the junkyard after ten years 
and to be replaced by others. Its labors are endless, although the State and 
Capital take from it whatever they find useful. Theoretical communism does not 
attempt to know or to say everything, but to know enough to show the leading 
thread of its times and to point out, at any given moment, the outlook for the 
future. It knows what questions to pose, because it feels a real need to 
discover them (which is not to say that it always does so or does so 
immediately). Others have just as pressing a need to constantly beat around the 
bush. The researcher makes his living by researching; he negates himself as a 
researcher when he makes a discovery. In this manner one problem must engender 
another. These people and their companions in their wearisome labors seem to 
distinguish themselves simply by the different forms given to the same ideas: 
but a different form of expression in fact contains a different content. They 
retain only the critical aspect of the revolutionary attitude, forgetting its 
prospective aspects. Instead of indicating the practice which corresponds with 
the theory, they conclude with the need of always inventing something new. The 
revolution demolishes idols, but never in the manner of these false iconoclasts.</p>
