<p class="fst">The clarification of what is known as National Bolshevism does 
not serve merely a tactical or polemical purpose, in opposition to those who, 
since Lenin, have utilized this current to discredit the left. National 
Bolshevism also exhibited some of the ambiguities which have afflicted communism 
since the time of Marx and Engels: the revolutionary position to be adopted in 
regards to war once again posed a mass of problems.</p>

<p class="fst">The communist movement was effectively absorbed by the democratic 
and nationalist movement of 1848. This development had already been of 
considerable significance even before 1848. The movement in England had been 
submerged within Chartism, and then, after the 1840s, in its defeat. What the 
Communist League had gained in terms of theoretical precision in regard to the 
analysis of capitalism and the means for revolution (dictatorship of the 
proletariat), in comparison to its predecessors, the League of the Exiles and 
the League of the Just, it lost in regard to the depth of its affirmation of the 
content of <i>communism</i>.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> Unlike Engels&#8217; initial project, the <i>Manifesto</i> 
does not mention the suppression of exchange. This development was a complex 
movement, and was simultaneously a process of the breakdown of social bonds as 
well as a manifestation of progress. The communitarian perspective was best 
rooted in the analysis of capital and was at the same time conceived of 
primarily within the context of its political dimension (the problem of power, 
relations with the bourgeois revolution). The course of events caused this 
contradiction to grow more acute. In 1848-1849, the League did not intervene in 
the revolutions under its own banners: it judged that it was more realistic to 
advise its members to act individually within the democratic organizations born 
of the bourgeois revolution.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> In France, the &#8220;neo-Babouvists&#8221; or &#8220;materialist 
communists&#8221;, like Dézamy, who were active before 1848, disappeared in the 
turmoil and were unable to assert themselves as such.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> <i>The New Rhineland 
Gazette</i>, led by Marx, became the &#8220;Organ of democracy&#8221;. It would be useless 
to try to explain this strategy, which has been justified countless times. It 
was not the unavoidable compromise with the still-ascendant capitalism which was 
in question, but the conditions under which this compromise was made. One cannot 
deny the objective effect of the pressure of circumstances on the communist 
movement. The reformist compromises made by Marx and Engels, as well as by other 
revolutionaries, predated the era of the IWA. The weakness of the movement led 
it to seek external factors which could revive the struggle, to replace the 
flagging proletariat. In 1848, Marx advocated a revolutionary war by a united 
Germany against Russia, just as he would, in 1870, consider a Prussian victory 
over France as favorable, since such a victory would unify the German 
revolutionary movement and undermine France enough to liquidate the 
Proudhonists. Marx continued to hope that the wars of his time would reactivate 
the revolutionary movement.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not enough to claim that, during Marx&#8217;s time, national wars 
could still play a subversive role, which role would terminate with the end of 
capital&#8217;s ascendant phase: the &#8220;national bolshevism&#8221; of 1919 would thus make no 
sense from the revolutionary point of view. We must also ask ourselves about the 
strength (and the possible influence) of the communist movement in the epoch in 
question: if it was as weak as it was in 1848-1849, then how would it have been 
possible to hope for an eventual German victory over Russia when such an outcome 
would exclusively strengthen the German <i>bourgeoisie</i> rather than the 
proletariat? It is surprising that Marx underestimated the counterrevolutionary 
force of nationalism. From this perspective, the &#8220;error&#8221; of Wolffheim and 
Laufenberg reproduced Marx&#8217;s error in an absurd form.</p>

<p class="fst">The idea of using such a war to reactivate the revolutionary 
movement, which is in itself insufficient, is inscribed within a much broader 
illusion, that of a &#8220;strategy&#8221; which would allow the supersession of the 
objective limitations of circumstances by means of ingenious alliances on a 
planetary scale. The notion of such a total strategy belongs to anti-materialist 
scientism. It presupposes the understanding of rational laws whose rule would 
provide the key and the means to action. Often practiced by Marx, and theorized 
in numerous works by Bordiga, it became a systematic pathology in the journal <i>
Le fil du Temps</i> and in R. Dangeville, whose introductions and notes to his 
translations of Marx describe a Marx who was always right and who had foreseen 
everything: even when he was wrong, his error was still more profound than the 
apparent truth... But it is not a question of counting errors, or of 
reconstructing an allegedly coherent system which revolutionaries do not need. 
Others, in an opposite sense, enjoy celebrating proletarian initiative and will 
to struggle, or theorizing irrationalism, which is only the symmetrical and 
worst product of bourgeois rationalism. To speak of &#8220;revolutionary reformism&#8221;<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> 
is to take it for granted that Marx understood that the communist revolution was 
not the order of the day, and that he had limited himself to inciting capital to 
the next stage of capitalist development. Marx&#8217;s reformism is therefore 
justified in the name of the immaturity of the preconditions for revolution. 
This position is characterized by the intervention of <i>hindsight</i>. It 
projects the analysis of the causes of the defeats of bygone days (which is only 
possible today) upon the past, as if it would have been possible <i>in that 
epoch</i> to be certain that any revolution was condemned to defeat. This 
conception does not analyze the facts on the basis of their dynamic, and, as 
Marx said concerning the Historical School of Law, history can only be seen &#8220;<i>a 
posteriori</i>&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">Faced with the war, Lenin only saw a change at the level of 
political structures and the failure of a particular orientation, but not the 
failure of a whole type of workers activity and organization. In his text 
published in 1915, Gorter discerned the end of an epoch in 1914, which also 
implied, he said, the death of art. He considered 1914 to be a profound, 
crushing defeat for proletarians. Without being able to explicitly express it, 
he had intuited capital&#8217;s power, its expansion over the previous few years, 
which was only disrupted by the war of 1914-1918. Characterized by the 
introduction of the assembly line, the scientific organization of labor, 
rationalization, mass consumption, the &#8220;commodification&#8221; of social life and 
large-scale mechanized industry, this dynamism suffocated the proletariat: the 
very strict integration of the workers organizations was only one of its 
consequences.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> Gorter thus proved to be relatively pessimistic concerning the 
revolutionary dawning of the postwar years.</p>

<p class="fst">From the beginning, the position of Laufenberg and Wolffheim was 
different. Laufenberg, originally from the Rhineland, was at first a militant of 
the SPD center. He came to Hamburg in 1907 on Mehring&#8217;s recommendation to write 
a history of the workers movement. An anti-reformist, he was deprived of all 
party employment in 1912, and met Wolffheim, a Jewish journalist who had 
recently returned from the United States. Their hostility to the sacred union (<i>Burgfrieden</i>) 
during the war presaged their later evolution. <i>Democracy and Organization</i>, 
which they published in 1915, emphasized the bourgeoisie&#8217;s inability to solve 
the national and democratic questions: &#8220;Germany has by no means become an 
authentic national state. It is proletarian politics which will assume the task 
of achieving national unity.&#8221; But they pronounced themselves in favor of the 
abolition of national borders. In this connection, L. Dupeux speaks of a mixture 
of &#8220;scientism&#8221;, &#8220;spontaneism&#8221; and Lassallian reminiscences. They advocated a 
multi-stage movement: the dictatorship of the proletariat could not be installed 
&#8220;at one blow&#8221;. Combining Kautsky-style determinism with the Luxemburgist idea of 
the mass strike, they conceived of a cautious policy on the economic and social 
plane, since holding on to political power was of the essence. We have seen at 
the end of Chapter 6 that Luxemburg was to develop a similar position in 
November-December 1918.</p>

<p class="fst">It is likely that Wolffheim and Laufenberg were to adopt the 
councilist thesis because the councils could progressively integrate the whole 
population. The trade unions and the parties would be superseded. The particular 
organizations of distinct social groups must give way to mass organizations 
which transcend divisive class lines.</p>

<p class="fst">While admitting that the aggressor-victim distinction had lost 
its meaning within the context of imperialism, they accepted national defense in 
some cases, when a war threatened &#8220;the social economy&#8221; as an expression and 
precondition of the life of the people. Other revolutionaries did not notice, at 
that time, these aspects which anticipated their later evolution.</p>

<p class="fst">Even so, these aspects had no practical application at all during 
the first six months following November 1918. As related above, Laufenberg, at 
the head of the Hamburg Council, demonstrated great prudence, even trying to 
enlist the help of the bourgeoisie: &#8220;we are the only ones who can guarantee a 
peaceful transition&#8221;, he declared in a speech on November 30. Judging that the 
Russian revolution had little chance of success, he made everything depend on 
Germany, where he intended&#8212;because the proletariat had already demonstrated its 
weakness&#8212;to avoid a civil war and, consequently, to not proceed too hastily, to 
nationalize, of course, but to limit instances of socialization. He did not, 
therefore, advocate abstentionism and even desired, in addition to the councils, 
an assembly elected by universal suffrage, in which the bourgeoisie could 
express itself and &#8220;exercise an influence on the course of events in proportion 
to its economic position&#8221;. Laufenberg, a member of the KPD Central Committee 
until August 1919, thus appeared as the defender of factory organizations, 
alongside the rest of the left, although he supported them for <i>different</i> 
reasons.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">On October 25, 1919, Wolffheim and Laufenberg held a conference 
in Hamburg to create a new party. It was only at this time, and thus after the 
Heidelberg schism, that Radek discovered (&#8220;with surprise&#8221;, according to 
Dupeux<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a>) their nationalist positions. He attacked them and called them 
&#8220;nationalist Bolsheviks&#8221; (the term &#8220;national-bolshevik&#8221; would not make its 
appearance until the spring of 1920).</p>

<p class="fst">Stress on the nationalist aspect became more acute, but coexisted 
for a long time with a class analysis. In June of 1919, the Hamburg <i>KAZ</i> 
asserted that the community of language, culture and nationality must be taken 
into account, especially in a time of proletarianization. It was not therefore a 
matter of either absorbing the workers into the people, or of describing Germany 
as a &#8220;proletarian nation&#8221;<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> in the sense of the Italian use of the term, but, 
on the contrary, of adding the majority of the non-working layers to the 
proletariat. Ultimately, only the big bourgeoisie was excluded. In 1863, 
Lassalle had already opposed between 89% and 96.25% of the population to the 
bourgeoisie. It was <i>workerism</i> which was behind this nationalist concept. 
The &#8220;working masses&#8221; of the large factories would dominate the dictatorship of 
the proletariat. Where such factories did not exist, the councils were to have a 
territorial structure.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The councils system groups together all the workers ... behind 
the class interests which are the interests of socialism and the nation. The 
factory councils will become an element of national unity, of national 
organization, of national fusion, because they comprise the basic element and 
original cell of socialism.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">One week later, another editorial called for a &#8220;proletarian <i>
Wehrmacht</i>&#8221;, formed by a workers militia and a Red Army under the command of 
the councils, in order to &#8220;continue&#8221; the war. But the <i>KAZ</i> was against any 
national bolshevism on the part of the army high command. It reproached 
Spartacism for its putschism: &#8220;the revolution will break out like a natural 
phenomenon&#8221;, &#8220;not by means of rebellions and putsches&#8221;. It expected that, in the 
context of the second revolution and the continuation of the war, there would 
not be a social peace (<i>Burgfrieden</i>), as in 1914, but a revolutionary 
union, this time to the benefit of the proletariat and the whole people, rather 
than the bourgeoisie. In effect, the war was necessary because Versailles 
prevented the development of the German economy (hence the conflict with France 
and England) as well as union with Russia (hence the conflict with Poland). 
Although Wolffheim and Laufenberg did not hesitate to expound their thesis to 
soldiers, they made no contacts at all with the right-wing press. At the end of 
1919, they began distance themselves from the Russian revolution which, they 
wrote, was not a &#8220;universal model&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">The official history of the KPD, published in 1929, did not 
include the accusation that Laufenberg and Wolffheim carried out &#8220;negotiations&#8221; 
with the military. According to this history, several thousand Hamburg workers 
initially supported Wolffheim and Laufenberg as opposed to a few hundred who 
backed the KPD. The Sailor&#8217;s Union&#8217;s politics was at once &#8220;national&#8221; and working 
class (defense of the instruments of labor); it refused to staff the ships which 
Germany was obliged by the terms of the Versailles treaty to surrender to 
England. Wolffheim and Laufenberg also enjoyed solid support among the Berlin 
communists who were associated with Wendel.</p>

<p class="fst">Their <i>Appeal to Proletarians</i>, published in May of 1920, 
was issued in the name of the Central Committee of the KAPD, which immediately 
declared that it had not been consulted regarding the publication of this 
pamphlet. The ship hijacked by Jung for his journey to Russia in 1920 was 
re-christened the <i>Laufenberg</i> (it had previously been known as the <i>
Senator Schröder</i>). Until early in 1920, despite the crucial divergence over 
the national question, it seems that the majority of the KAPD&#8217;s members still 
considered the Wolffheim-Laufenberg tendency to be a current within the 
communist left. Despite the scandal which broke out in April of 1920 around a 
&#8220;National Bolshevik&#8221; plot, no member of the KAPD was implicated. Wolffheim and 
Laufenberg were excluded from the KAPD at the end of May and then, in August, by 
the full KAPD Congress, but they participated alongside the KAPD in the actions 
in support of Russia in its war against Poland (July-August). National 
Bolshevism subsequently disappeared as a revolutionary tendency after the summer 
of 1920. It is significant, however, that Rühle&#8217;s Dresden journal, <i>Der 
Kommunist</i>, still included, in the fall of 1920, Wolffheim and Laufenberg&#8217;s <i>
Appeal to the German Proletariat</i> among the books and pamphlets which were 
being read by militants.</p>

<p class="fst">In <i>Moscow and the German Revolution, a Critical Refutation of 
Bolshevik Methods</i>, Wolffheim and Laufenberg for the first time directly 
attacked Lenin and the Bolsheviks: &#8220;State capitalism&#8221; reigns in Russia. At the 
end of July, they founded the Communist League, which rejected any kind of party 
and considered itself to be a &#8220;propaganda association&#8221;. &#8220;The League regrouped 
most of the KAPD&#8217;s northwest district, its two strongholds being Hamburg, with 
its shipyards, and Wendel&#8217;s group in Berlin...&#8221;<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> The rightist tendency gained 
ground. A Free Association for the Study of German Communism was founded, 
concerning which Laufenberg would say that it fought for a <i>Volksgemeinschaft</i> 
(a term used by the Nazis to designate the community of the people). One of its 
members wrote a pamphlet supporting the policy of the conservatives who favored 
an alliance with Russia: <i>Communism: A National Necessity</i>. Henceforth, the 
accent would be put on nationalism rather than socialism. Communism, this 
pamphlet asserted, is not social democratic reformism: the critique of social 
democracy is utilized to reject socialism. The social base shifts: Wolffheim and 
Laufenberg cultivate their connections with the officers of the Hamburg merchant 
marine, who embrace national-communism. They maintain numerous contacts in 
Hamburg and Berlin, but reject joint action with the most reactionary 
publications (such as the <i>Orgesch</i>) as well as with the Spartacists. The 
movement stagnated after 1921. Laufenberg became ill and withdrew from political 
activity. Wolffheim was active in &#8220;national bolshevik&#8221; groupuscules and died in 
a concentration camp.</p>

<p class="fst">From a nationalist perspective, National Bolshevism represented a 
process of becoming conscious of the capitalist tendency to dissolve the middle 
classes and the proletariat into a mass of wage &#8220;workers&#8221; (which, in a way, 
achieves the abolition of the bourgeoisie-proletariat distinction).</p>

<p class="fst">From a workerist perspective, National Bolshevism is also a 
process of becoming conscious of the revolution as a fusion and transcendence of 
classes and categories. Any ruling class, Laufenberg wrote in April 1920, tries 
to present its interests as common interests, and this applies to the 
proletariat as much as to the bourgeoisie, but the former is much more justified 
in doing so, since it represents the &#8220;majority of society&#8221;. This is why he did 
not hesitate to invoke the &#8220;whole people&#8221; and the &#8220;whole nation&#8221;. Once again we 
encounter the workerism and the preoccupation with the criterion of majority 
rule which were at the core of the German revolutionary movement. This formalism 
manifests the weakness of the communist perspective: that the latter should take 
refuge in art (Die Aktion) or in various marginal social experiments (communes, 
etc.: cf. Appendix I) is significant.</p>

of the middle classes, whose national-bolshevism he takes into account in trying 
to define a strategy, wanting to utilize the advancing proletarianization (when 
it actually derived from the communist parties). He fits perfectly into a wide 
range of such phenomena as the Popular Fronts, Popular Unions of France, Popular 
Unities, States of the whole people and other historical compromises. But the 
national-bolshevism of Hamburg also was just one of the &#8220;deviations&#8221; of the
