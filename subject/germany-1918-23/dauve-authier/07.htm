<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="fst">When Rühle envisaged a Fourth International in <i>Moscow and Us</i> 
(September 1920), the political current of &#8220;council communism&#8221; had several 
hundred thousand adherents in Germany, a figure which would decline to 20,000 in 
1923, and then would be reduced to a few hundred when Hitler took power.</p>

<p class="fst">The construction of a Communist Workers International (KAI, its 
German acronym) is explicitly referred to in the declaration of the KAPD central 
committee (July 1921) which officially acknowledged the party&#8217;s break with 
Moscow, or (in the eyes of those who disapproved of this decision) which made 
the break irremediable. Gorter was one of its most fervent advocates. But the 
KAPD Congress of September 1921 proved to be much less enthusiastic. This issue 
would be one of the causes of the schism of the KAPD, and the parallel split 
within the AAUD, into two factions.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Basically, the so-called &#8220;Berlin&#8221; tendency prioritized the 
reconsolidation of a party which had been in free-fall since the spring of 1921. 
In the disturbances of 1923, its calls for an insurrection fell on deaf ears 
despite the increasing impoverishment of the working class as a result of an 
astronomical rate of inflation, within a context of social (and national) 
violence of every description. The AAUD-Berlin did, however, lead an important 
strike among the North Sea fishermen, but did so upon the basis of &#8220;industrial 
unionism&#8221; (that is, on the basis of a whole economic sector), and no longer on 
the basis of the unitary association of the workers of an entire region 
regardless of trade. The time of &#8220;unionism&#8221; had passed, and the time of 
struggles carried out according to job categories had returned, even if the 
combativity and solidarity evinced in the new struggles were still powerful.</p>

<p class="fst">The so-called Essen Tendency immediately made the formation of 
the KAI its principal activity. Its supporters thought it was vain and even 
dangerous to try to radicalize reformist struggles against a capitalism in its 
&#8220;death crisis&#8221;, which would lead to imprisoning the workers on an exclusively 
reform-oriented terrain. For this reason it no longer assigned the AAUD, or at 
least that part of the AAUD which remained under its influence, any other role 
than spreading revolutionary propaganda, the effects of which were to prove to 
be insignificant. Opposed to purely wage-oriented struggles, the Essen Tendency 
would provoke the appearance of various anti-leadership, anti-organization, 
anti-intellectualist and sometimes even anti-intellectual theories.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAI would hold several conferences, and one of their few 
consistent attendees would be the Bulgarian left communists. After 1924 it would 
exist only as an idea episodically propagandized by a small office staff.</p>

<p class="fst">What sense was there in creating an International when it had 
already been pointed out, by Gorter in 1923, for example, and not without some 
basis in reality, that &#8220;the world proletariat as a whole has until now proved to 
be hostile to communism&#8221;?</p>

<p class="fst">This absurdity has a logic of its own, based upon the expectation 
that, as capitalist attacks against the proletarians increased (and this view 
would persist after 1919, during the 1920s, after 1933, etc.), the proletarians 
would be increasingly driven to rise against capitalism. It was therefore 
thought necessary to construct the organization which, though minuscule today, 
would not fail to grow tomorrow...</p>

<p class="fst">The historical conditions did not permit the KAPD to be anything 
but a detachment of &#8220;shock troops&#8221;, in Franz Jung&#8217;s formulation. And its 
attempts to compensate for this weakness by intervening in the international 
arena were to be in vain.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2>The Third International<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></h2>

<p class="fst">1. The Third International is a Russian creation, a creation of 
the Russian Communist Party. It was created as a support for the Russian 
revolution, that is, for a revolution which was partly proletarian, partly 
bourgeois.</p>

<p class="fst">2. Due to the dual nature of the Russian revolution, insofar as 
the Third International had to come to the aid of both the Russian proletarian 
revolution as well as the Russian bourgeois revolution, and thus as a result of 
the dual nature of its purpose as well, the Third International was transformed 
into an organization which was partly proletarian and partly capitalist.</p>

<p class="fst">3. Insofar as it called for revolution and the expropriation of 
the capitalists, it was a proletarian organization oriented towards the 
suppression of capitalism; insofar as it preserved parliamentarism, the trade 
unions, and the dictatorship of the party and of its leaders, it was a bourgeois 
organization, created to conserve and to reconstruct capitalism: 
parliamentarism, the trade unions, and the dictatorship of the party or its 
leaders do not lead to communism, but to the preservation of capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">4. The Third International was thus, from its very inception, a 
partially counterrevolutionary organization.</p>

<p class="fst">5. In the European countries, this organization led not to 
victory, but to the defeat of the proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">6. Now that, after the spring of 1921, the Bolshevik Party which 
exercises its dictatorship in Russia has gone over to capitalism, it has rapidly 
compelled the Third International to return to capitalism, and the Third 
International has effectively become completely capitalist and bourgeois since 
the summer of 1921. The revolution was abandoned, the Third International no 
longer sought anything but reforms, and its goal has become the reconstruction 
of capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">7. Since Russian capitalism must be reconstructed, and since this 
capitalism cannot be reconstructed without the repair and reconstruction of 
European capitalism, the Third International was forced to abandon the 
revolution and to turn to reformism, that is, to propose the reconstruction of 
capitalism as its goal.</p>

<p class="fst">8. And in order to reconstruct capitalism, the Third 
International&#8212;just as the Russian Bolshevik Party, now capitalist, forges links 
with European capitalist governments and with European capitalism in order to 
reconstruct Russian capitalism&#8212;now forges links with the Second International, 
and with the Two-and-a-Half International,<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> for the reconstruction of European 
capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">9. The purpose of the Second International, of the Two-and-a-Half 
International, and of the Third International, is the same as that of the 
capitalist States and their governments. The united front of these three 
Internationals is a united front with capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">10. When capitalism is in the midst of a death crisis and no 
longer sees any way out, the Soviet government and the Third International offer 
to save it.</p>

<p class="fst">11. This is why the Third International, like the Russian 
Bolshevik Party, has become a completely counterrevolutionary organization, an 
organization which is betraying the proletariat. It must be put into the same 
bag with the Second International and the Two-and-a-Half International.</p>

<p class="fst">12. Just as the proletariat in all countries is a tool in the 
hands of the social democratic, bourgeois and reactionary parties for preserving 
capitalism, for rebuilding it and spreading it throughout the world, delivering 
government power to these parties and their leaders, so the proletariat is now, 
in turn, becoming an instrument in the hands of the Third International, and for 
the same objective. The goal of the Third International is not revolution and 
the liberation of the proletariat, but personal power in the bourgeois State and 
the enslavement of the proletariat.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h2>The Communist Workers International</h2>

<p class="fst">1. To the degree that the situation of the whole international 
proletariat, within a world capitalism which is undergoing its death crisis, 
requires the proletarian revolution as the realization of its current practical 
task, to that same degree the intellectual groundwork and organizational 
relations of the world working class fail to measure up to the occasion of this 
historical challenge. The overwhelming majority of the world proletariat is a 
prisoner of the ways of thought of bourgeois private property and the forms of 
international class collaboration between capitalism and the proletariat, forms 
which, each playing its part within a unified process, are supported with every 
available means by all the existing organizations of the proletariat; this 
places before the revolutionary proletarians of every country the historically 
inevitable consequence of founding a new proletarian International.</p>

<p class="fst">2. This new proletarian International, the <i>Communist Workers 
International</i> (KAI), represents the pure proletarian class struggle, and has 
the practical task of abolishing bourgeois-capitalist private property and 
transforming it into proletarian-socialist property in common. Beyond this goal, 
it carries out a basic struggle for the realization of the communist society.</p>

<p class="fst">3. Recognizing that the objective preconditions for the overthrow 
of the bourgeoisie and the rule of the proletariat currently exist, it places at 
the forefront of its activity the principle of the development of the class 
consciousness of the proletariat, that is, it wants to help the proletariat 
recognize that it is historically necessary to immediately do away with 
capitalism; for that same reason it wants to awaken within the proletariat the 
effective will to carry out the proletarian revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">4. The achievement of these goals requires as a precondition the 
openly anti-capitalist character (from the perspective of content as well as 
form) of its organization and the leadership of all its struggles. Its highest 
point of reference is not the particular interest of national associations of 
workers considered in isolation from one another, but the common interest of the 
entire world proletariat: the world proletarian revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">5. As a first step on the road to its goal, it strives to make 
the proclamation of the class dictatorship of the proletariat understood as the 
destruction of capitalist State powers and the installation of proletarian State 
administrative bodies (Council States). It rejects all methods of reformist 
struggle and it fights with the anti-parliamentary and anti-trade union weapons 
of the revolutionary proletarian class for the creation of revolutionary workers 
councils and revolutionary Factory Organizations (Workers Unions).</p>

<p class="fst">6. It especially directs its battle against the existing 
international organizations of the proletariat (the London, Vienna and Moscow 
Internationals) which, as accomplices of the bourgeoisie in their mutual efforts 
to reconstruct world capitalism, are trying to forge a united front of the 
bourgeoisie and the proletariat against the world proletarian revolution and 
consequently represent the most dangerous obstacles standing in the way of the 
liberation of the proletariat.</p>

core of their rank and file had joined (for the most part, temporarily) the 
Third International. Almost all of these individuals and groups would later 
return to the social democracy.</p>
