<h3><a name="h1">The First Congress</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The First Congress of the Communist International (March 1919) 
was originally intended to be merely a preparatory conference for the foundation 
of the new International.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> The Congress was not representative of the world 
movement: almost all the delegates came from Russia or the adjoining countries 
controlled by the Russians, and the westerners present came from small groups 
residing in Russia. The European delegates who attended the Congress only did so 
because they happened to be in Russia at the time. Only the presence of 
Eberlein, the KPD delegate (an adherent of the party&#8217;s right wing), testifies to 
the existence of a revolutionary movement beyond the zone of Russian control. As 
for the project of creating an International, which would not really be in a 
position to direct the necessary struggles, Eberlein was very reticent, and 
feared that the International would only exist on paper, or would be something 
like a &#8220;spiritual center&#8221;. What he wanted, however, was an &#8220;organizing center&#8221; 
and, unlike its predecessor, a powerful and highly-structured International. But 
he was swept up with the general enthusiasm and ultimately voted in favor of the 
immediate foundation of the Communist International.</p>

<p class="fst">Between 1918 and 1919, a large number of communist parties and 
groups evolved towards leftist positions, especially in respect to the 
parliamentary question, and thus underwent organizational and political crises, 
which were exacerbated by the actions of the Communist International (cf. 
Chapter 17). As in France or in Great Britain, the leftist tendencies were 
sometimes small minorities, but considered as a whole they comprised a 
significant proportion of the first adherents of the Communist International.</p>

<p class="fst">The positions held by the Russians were little known at that 
time, and sometimes were not even known at all. The subsequent disillusionment 
derived from the fact that people generally trusted the reports they received, 
focusing above all on the &#8220;soviet&#8221; aspect of the revolution. Since they had 
carried out a violent revolution <i>against</i> the elected parliament, the 
Bolsheviks were considered to be hostile to parliament, and it was thought that 
they would declare themselves against the employment of traditional methods. 
Didn&#8217;t the texts of the First Congress attack bourgeois democracy? While they 
said that democracy is counterrevolutionary, and that the parliamentary form is 
not suitable for the revolution, they did not explicitly state that one should 
refuse to engage in parliamentary activity. The Bolsheviks knew that 
parliamentary democracy <i>is not the adequate form</i> for the revolution and 
for post-revolutionary society: only the European communist left understood that 
parliamentary democracy constituted a <i>danger</i> to the proletariat, a 
treacherous terrain where it would become lost. The Russians had fought in a 
society where democracy was opposed to the established regime. There, democracy 
had at least represented a small part of the real social movement, its internal 
conflicts and those which existed between the movement and the State found an 
echo and real interest outside of parliament because democracy allowed the 
revolutionaries to transform it into a tribunal precisely because democracy was 
suppressed. Only in this situation was it possible to speak of &#8220;revolutionary 
parliamentarism&#8221;. In Western Europe, on the other hand, democracy, within 
certain limits (women&#8217;s suffrage, etc.), was accepted by the State.</p>

<p class="fst">At the First Congress Lenin defended a confused position in 
respect to the institutions which had arisen in the west during and after the 
war, comparing them to the Russian soviets.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> In reality, the German councils 
were reactionary, and the shop stewards&#8217; committees and factory councils did not 
sufficiently transcend the framework of the enterprise to be considered 
potential organs of proletarian power:<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> the Second Congress would later adopt a 
clearer position, despite a certain formalism, by defining the &#8220;preconditions 
for the creation of workers councils&#8221;<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a>. In 1919, Eberlein wanted the Congress to 
admit the complexity of the trade union issue. It was too simple, he said, to 
issue calls for &#8220;revolutionizing&#8221; the trade unions whose structure was adapted 
to the old State system: the &#8220;leadership of the economic movement&#8221; had passed to 
the councils, the trade unions having become, in Germany, &#8220;simple mutual aid 
organizations&#8221;. It was impossible to predict developments in this sector and 
consequently to provide clear directives for action which would be valid for all 
countries. He continued: &#8220;Wherever possible, we must make use of the 
revolutionary trade union in the struggle.&#8221; This tactical flexibility was all 
the more surprising since he also demanded a centralized International. His 
point of view was reminiscent of Luxemburg&#8217;s assessments of the trade unions at 
the end of 1918. The problem was not the trade union itself, but the functions, 
1) of economic struggles, and 2) of the structures which these struggles 
provided themselves. If there is an ascendant movement (and the left therefore 
always reasons from this perspective) the organs born from the purely reformist 
struggle during the period of stability are not neutral instruments which one 
could possibly make use of and acquire influence over, and win a majority: their 
function is opposed to the revolution. This analysis applies to the <i>councils</i> 
as well as to the trade unions. If they become stable institutions defending 
limited interests of the workers, both the trade unions and the councils must be 
destroyed. The Spartacists, however, went from the trade union to the council 
with the shift of workers activity from one to the other: they were looking for 
an institution where they could exercise their influence.</p>

<p class="fst">The relations between western and Russian communists in 1919-1921 
(and thus the Communist International as well) were characterized by a certain 
mutual incomprehension which would not be dispelled until after 1921 (although 
some, such as Rühle, displayed more lucidity in this regard). The non-Russian 
communists made an effort to organize centers for propaganda, reflection and 
tactical elaboration: even though they were not at first aware of the fact, 
these efforts clashed with the intentions of the Russians to centralize the 
international activities of the movement under their leadership. But the 
Bolsheviks could not be victorious without the help of two convergent factors. 
First, the difficulties and setbacks of the revolution, which forced the 
communists in the most active countries into clandestinity, did not facilitate 
the installation of permanent centers. But this &#8220;technical&#8221; reality, which the 
Russians so heavily emphasized, did not explain everything. The failure or the 
stagnation of the movement in Europe caused a large number of western communists 
to accept Russian tutelage on the theoretical and <i>organizational</i> planes. 
At the Second Congress, out of 167 delegates, 40% were Russians or 
&#8220;assimilables&#8221;. Germany, Great Britain and the United States had five votes 
each, that is, as many as Finland or Georgia. The Italian Socialist Party had 4 
votes (as did the Austrian Communist Party): its three factions were 
represented, but only the center possessed a deliberative voice. The 
organization of the Congress was in the hands of the Bolsheviks: the Executive 
Committee named in 1919 was still Russian, since, out of all the other parties, 
only the Hungarian Communist Party had been able to send a delegate.</p>

<p class="fst">One could devote an entire volume to the study of the perfectly 
sincere and revolutionary communists who accepted the Bolshevik positions 
without ever seeing the matter from the point of view of the left; in France, <i>
The Communist Bulletin</i> and Rosmer provided a good example of what is said 
above concerning the left&#8217;s misunderstandings. For them, Bolshevism was the 
entire strategy and program; all that was needed was to know how to apply it to 
other countries. They did not understand that bolshevism was, according to the 
most generous hypothesis, the best product of the socialist movement as it had 
existed prior to 1914, without ever going beyond those limits. Its perspective 
transcended the Russian framework, since the socialist movement there could not, 
from the beginning, triumph without the world revolution. But in order to be 
capable of taking all the tactics of the world revolution into consideration, a 
step was necessary which the Russians never took. The lack of information (which 
was, however, often exaggerated)<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> was only a secondary reason: the Russians 
made use of the European documents by only reading into them what they had 
previously wanted to find. Lenin, who was often more perspicacious than the 
westerners in his assessments, nonetheless demonstrated a high degree of 
incomprehension regarding the specific problems of the <i>communist</i> 
revolution in the more advanced countries.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> The situation as it developed 
between 1920 and 1921, along with Russian isolation due to the <i>European 
defeat</i>, led to an ambiguous policy on the part of the Bolsheviks, who were 
as concerned with protecting their state as with promoting the world revolution. 
This contradiction was unsustainable and would only really be resolved by 
Stalin. From this point of view, Trotskyism represents neither the best 
revolutionary expression of, nor a layer which broke loose from the Russian 
&#8220;bureaucracy&#8221;, nor an aberration, but a vain effort to preserve a revolutionary 
perspective by taking the heroic period as a basis, and ignoring the 
contradictions of that period.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> In the dead end of Trotskyism, its confused 
opportunism mixed with the memory of a few doctrinal points reproduced the 
caricatural and congenital ambiguity of the &#8220;first four congresses of the 
Communist International&#8221;. Militants like Rosmer did not see that, if it had 
spread, the revolution not only would not have respected the line established by 
the Russian leadership of the Communist International, but would have profoundly 
transformed the status and the nature of the Russian party itself, which might 
have, perhaps, found other leaders. The ebb of the movement in the West, 
however, caused its revolutionaries to <i>regress</i> to the Russian level.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">The Failure of the Amsterdam Bureau</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The Amsterdam Conference (January 1920) was held to define the 
basis upon which the Auxiliary Bureau (or sub-Bureau) for Western Europe should 
conduct its activities. Another office, the Berlin Secretariat, was to 
coordinate the movement in Eastern Europe, including <i>Germany</i>. But should 
communist organizations unify around centers which would define their own 
tactics, or should they merely support the Communist International&#8217;s activities? 
The question was hardly posed in 1919, and would soon receive an answer from 
events themselves. The KPN (the Communist Party of the Netherlands) played a 
preponderant role in the Bureau. It had distinguished itself during the war by 
its collaboration with anarchists and anarchosyndicalists. Rutgers, in his 
report to the First Congress of the Communist International, declared: &#8220;We have 
always got along better with the syndicalist elements of the workers movement 
[than with the reformist socialist party] and when the civil war broke out, our 
party, together with the syndicalists and an anarchist group, formed a 
revolutionary committee.&#8221;<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> Although the KPN sent two deputies to the Dutch 
parliament, Pannekoek, Gorter and Roland-Holst were opposed to parliamentary 
action. It was one of the first parties to break with the Communist 
International, which it had joined in April 1919 when it named Wijnkoop as a 
delegate to the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI). 
Rutgers (cf. Chapter 17), who had arrived in Amsterdam in November, intervened 
in the debate on the parliamentary question and took the side of the left.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Amsterdam Conference was attended by the leaders of the KPN, 
S. Pankhurst, Willis and Hodgson (British Socialist Party, a centrist party 
which would contribute the bulk of the membership of that country&#8217;s Communist 
Party), Murphy (delegate of the Shop Stewards Movement), L. Fraina (American 
communist) and Borodin.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> What particularly distinguished the debate was the 
high proportion of Anglo-Saxons present. With some 20 participants, this 
conference was more representative of the international revolutionary movement 
and specifically of the weight of the left in that movement than was the First 
Congress of the Communist International. Zetkin, who arrived just before the end 
of the conference, denied its representative character. The discussion would end 
prematurely due to the intervention of the police. One part of the delegation 
dispersed, while others, in a private capacity, carried on the discussion 
elsewhere.</p>

<p class="fst">Pankhurst proposed the organization of an international strike 
against intervention in Russia, with at least one month of preparation. Gorter 
expressed his approval and wanted the same thing to be done in the event of a 
revolution in Germany. Wijnkoop thought it would be difficult to organize an 
international action, and contested Gorter&#8217;s key argument, which the latter had 
often made during that period and which he would mention in his <i>Open Letter 
to Comrade Lenin</i>: that the unification of capital also obliges the 
proletarians to unite. Wijnkoop denied that capital was as unified as Gorter had 
claimed, and did not believe that a revolution was immanent in Germany. The 
resolution passed, advocating the preparation of the proletariat for a general 
strike if the revolution were to break out in any country.</p>

<p class="fst">Fraina&#8217;s resolution on the trade unions combined &#8220;industrial 
unions&#8221; (not organized by trade) with political action. It implicitly rejected 
the theses defended by, for example, the Italian &#8220;<i>ordinovistas</i>&#8221; 
associated with Gramsci: &#8220;The conception according to which the workers, under 
capitalist rule, must acquire in their industrial unions the experience and the 
technical skills to run the new society, and that they have to gradually 
acquire, through their industrial unions, power over industry, is confused with 
the proposals of parliamentary socialism which hold that the workers must 
gradually conquer experience in the affairs of State by means of control over 
the bourgeois State. Each of these conceptions rejects, in its own way, the 
fundamental problem of the revolutionary conquest of State power. The conquest 
of State power: that is the goal of the revolutionary proletariat.&#8221;<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> The 
institution for this conquest was the soviet. This resolution, however, was 
still confused: it fought against &#8220;laborism&#8221; and the traditional trade unions, 
but called for the conquest of the &#8220;industrial unions&#8221;. The trade unions were 
weapons of capital, but the industrial unions were potentially weapons of the 
proletariat. These industrial unions would become the classical unions of the 
post-war era, particularly in the United States (the CIO) but also in Europe: 
the evolution of the trade unions at Renault illustrates this development quite 
well.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> This position was all the more contradictory since the resolution 
admitted that &#8220;the development of imperialism determines the definitive 
absorption of the trade unions by capitalism&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">Concerning parliamentarism, the conference limited itself to 
outlining the divergent positions, without pronouncing in favor of one or the 
other. Almost all of the delegates were in favor of breaking with the socialist 
parties. The resolution on communist unity, drafted by Fraina, advocated 
breaking with the member organizations of the Second International, and rejected 
the idea (which was supported by the Communist International and accepted by the 
English centrists) of communists affiliating with the Labor Party. It was also 
decided that &#8220;shop committees and other workers organizations&#8221; should be 
admitted into the Communist International, without making this a question of 
principle.</p>

<p class="fst">These measures, which were approved but never implemented, due to 
a lack of means and time, testify that the Bureau considered itself to be one of 
the centers of the movement in Europe. The Bureau published documents and issued 
a <i>Manifesto to the English, French and Belgian Workers</i> calling upon them 
to take action in case of allied intervention in Germany. The KAPD was accepted 
into the Bureau in April, even though Germany was the responsibility of the 
Berlin Secretariat, which was hostile to the KAPD and instead advocated working 
with the USPD.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> In May, the Bureau announced its opposition to communist 
affiliation with the Labor Party. Speaking at the SFIO&#8217;s Congress in Strasbourg 
(February 1920), Roland-Holst recommended the expulsion of its right wing. The 
Bureau, composed of Wijnkoop, Rutgers and Roland-Holst, was torn apart by the 
factional struggles within the KPN. On May 15, Radio Moscow announced the 
closing of what it simply referred to as the &#8220;Amsterdam Bureau&#8221; rather than the 
&#8220;Western European Bureau&#8221;, a title reserved for the Berlin Secretariat, which 
had played no effective role. The first and last attempt to coordinate the 
communist movement in the West had developed under the influence of the Left, 
and had resulted in failure. A second attempt would also fail. Created in Sofia 
in May of 1920, the Balkan Communist Federation, composed of the Bulgarian (cf. 
Chapter 17), Yugoslav, and Greek parties, as well as the communist fraction of 
the Romanian Socialist Party, which would found a Communist Party in May of 
1921, would not accept the directives of the Communist International. The 
Yugoslav Communist Party (founded in April 1919) did not adopt either the slogan 
of national self-determination or that of the distribution of land to the 
peasants (cf. Luxemburg&#8217;s critiques of the Bolsheviks&#8217; positions on these two 
issues in her notes on <i>The Russian Revolution</i>). One of its leaders 
characterized national struggles as &#8220;fights between rival bourgeoisies&#8221;. But 
this Communist Party accepted centrists as members and practiced parliamentarism 
on a grand scale. The Balkan Federation would disappear after 1923.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">The Second Congress of the Communist International</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Some of the rather optimistic positions of the Second Congress 
(July 1920) must again be set in context. After having been invaded by Poland, 
Russia counterattacked and penetrated Polish territory. Between sessions, the 
delegates received reports on the war, viewing the advance of the Red Army on a 
large wall map. The advance upon Warsaw was quickly stymied and the Russians had 
to beat a hasty retreat. The appeals directed by the Russians to the Polish 
workers clashed with the Poles&#8217; sense of national solidarity against their 
ancient foe: &#8220;the right of national self-determination&#8221;... This conflict also 
demonstrated that the Red Army, composed primarily of peasants, was more suited 
to the defense of Russian territory than for the world revolutionary war, as 
Gorter had already pointed out.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Confusion persisted concerning the Russians&#8217; position advising 
the revolutionaries in other countries not to &#8220;imitate&#8221; them. Many 
revolutionaries (Welti in Switzerland, Loriot in France, Pankhurst, 
Roland-Holst) interpreted this statement as the Russians&#8217; acceptance of 
wide-ranging autonomy.</p>

<p class="fst">In reality, however, by saying &#8220;do not imitate us&#8221;, the Russians 
actually intended to say: &#8220;Don&#8217;t think anymore about revolution&#8221;, &#8220;don&#8217;t remain 
a small minority&#8221;, &#8220;form large mass parties&#8221;; and &#8220;imitate us&#8221; basically meant 
&#8220;make compromises&#8221; and &#8220;be disciplined&#8221;; what was essential for the Russians 
was, at that time, to stay in power, rather than worrying about the regression 
which their power was undergoing.</p>

<p class="fst">In September 1919, Roland-Holst asserted that profound 
differences existed between the Russian and Western masses.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> Others wanted 
the most rigorous centralism in order to prevent deviations: this was the 
position of the Italian Left, which was hardly more consistent than the other 
left tendencies, since it would be the (Russian) leadership of the Communist 
International which would be the great centralizing force for right wing 
deviations. The Russians wanted tactics adapted to the circumstances, <i>but 
only as they</i> understood them. A clear change of course on the part of the 
Russians took place in relation to the tactics to be followed in the West, and 
consequently, in relation to the Left as well. In 1919, the criteria for the 
membership in the communist parties, established after long deliberation, were 
agreement with the dictatorship of the proletariat, breaking with the 
socialists, and internationalism. Even among those who would join the Communist 
Party, some refused, in 1919-1920, to make parliamentary activity (which, 
however, they supported) a criterion for membership: &#8220;the differences of opinion 
on this issue will not interfere with the unification of the forces of the 
extreme left in Great Britain.&#8221;<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> On August 28, 1919, in reply to Pankhurst, 
Lenin announced his support for a realignment which would by no means exclude 
the antiparliamentarians:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If we consider the problem in its general and theoretical form, 
it is ... the same program, that is, the struggle for soviet power ... which can 
and, today, must unify all honest and sincere working class revolutionaries... 
The question of parliamentarism is now a partial and secondary question... I 
would consider the immediate foundation of Communist Parties, that is, of 
parties fighting for the transition from bourgeois parliamentarism to soviet 
power, to be an authentic step towards complete unity.&#8221;<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a></p>

<p class="fst">During the same period, Lenin advised Levi not to make 
parliamentarism grounds for a split. Similarly, on the topic of the trade 
unions, the Communist International evolved from a somewhat flexible position, 
not transforming the conquest of the traditional trade unions into a principle, 
to a tactic based on that very principle. During its first period, until the 
winter of 1919-1920, the Communist International rejected the destruction of the 
traditional trade union organizations wherever the revolutionary movement was 
growing (Germany). On the other hand, however, it allowed that American 
proletarians should leave the AFL and create another union based, among other 
organizations, on the membership of the IWW, not because an important movement 
existed at that time in the United States, but because the IWW had already 
organized a significant part of the working class.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> Later, in 1920-1921, 
under the influence of an increasingly difficult situation for the workers 
movement, the Communist International evolved towards the ambiguous position 
mentioned above. It is true that Lenin had never hesitated, for example, to seek 
&#8220;personalities&#8221; like Zetkin, Serrati, or the Romanian Rakovsky, for some <i>
legitimacy</i>. He needed a successor, and chose an heir from the &#8220;true&#8221; Second 
International. Altogether contradictory, Bolshevism developed its weakest 
(social democratic) aspects under the pressure of the decline of the movement: 
these aspects, never having been criticized, despite the revolutionary practice 
of the Bolsheviks in 1914, 1917, etc., returned to appear in force after 1919, 
when they would play a despicable role within a different context.</p>

<p class="fst">A little later, the tendency which sought parties capable of 
exercising pressure on their respective parliaments incited the Communist 
International to support the entrance of centrists into the Communist Parties 
(VKPD) and to encourage splits which would preserve the center (PCF). The year 
1919 witnessed the consolidation of the revolutionary regime in Russia and the 
defeat of the proletariat everywhere else. The movement was crushed everywhere: 
France, Great Britain, Italy, the USA, and Central Europe. The paradox resided 
in the fact that these defeats allowed the communist movement to become 
conscious of itself and its enemies, without thereby acquiring the means to 
assert itself and seize the initiative. Nothing had yet been definitively 
decided, but its weakness remained and would significantly diminish its 
possibilities in the following years. It increasingly abandoned the offensive 
into the hands of the Communist International, and consequently to its Russian 
leadership. It was not Lenin&#8217;s maneuvers which allowed him to control the 
Communist International, but the real situation of the divisions within the 
Communist International which demanded his leadership. Lenin was very careful 
not to do anything which would promote the unification of the international 
trend towards the left. He endeavored not to attack Loriot, even though Loriot 
was sympathetic to antiparliamentarism, because the French communists were not 
associated with the &#8220;international&#8221; left. Lenin treated Wijnkoop with caution, 
who maintained an intermediate position, against the affiliation of the 
socialist parties, but in favor of parliamentary activity whenever possible.</p>

<p class="fst">There was no contradiction between the first two congresses. 
Bolshevism had originally conceived of itself as the Russian method to create in 
Russia what <i>already</i> existed in the other large industrial countries, not 
to impose its own methods on others. What is to be done? Lenin copied Germany; 
he tried to be a better student of Kautsky than all the other Russian 
socialists. In 1907, while reflecting on the history of the Russian movement, he 
offered a modest reevaluation of his work <i>What is to be Done?</i>, defining 
it as &#8220;a summary of <i>Iskra</i> and its policy on organization between 1901 and 
1902. Just a summary, nothing more...&#8221;<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> If the European revolution had been 
successful, the Communist International probably would have been led by others, 
not by Russians. It was the defeat of the German and Hungarian revolutions which 
led the Communist International to advocate something other than strictly 
communist party groups. It was because the workers, everywhere, really accepted 
the elections, that the Communist International recommended parliamentary 
action, and why Lenin dared to say at the Second Congress that &#8220;Parliament is 
always the arena of the class struggle&#8221;. Arguing that the function of the Labour 
Party was to be an &#8220;organization of the bourgeoisie ... which only exists to 
systematically deceive the workers&#8221;, he nonetheless held that one had to &#8220;join 
it&#8221;.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> This contradiction cannot be understood unless one sees that for Lenin 
the revolutionary task consists in regrouping, in organizing the masses. He 
therefore sought an &#8220;institution&#8221;, a framework where agitation could take root: 
&#8220;can one conceive of any other institution so capable of interesting all 
classes, as parliament?&#8221; he asked in the speech quoted above. We should go 
wherever the masses are, from parliament to the cooperatives, from the trade 
unions to the town halls, etc... His point of view was imposed on a movement in 
decline, because he advocated organizing large masses of workers, even the 
majority, by means of all kinds of activities (trade unions, parliaments, etc.) 
whose &#8220;communist&#8221; character, however, would be guaranteed solely by the fact 
that communists would be their leaders: an appeal to principle of the kind 
Kautsky used to justify anything as long as &#8220;the doctrine&#8221; is guaranteed. The 21 
Conditions would then serve as a filter.</p>

<p class="fst">Approved by the Second Congress, the 21 Conditions manifested an 
anti-reformist organizational illusion, and were a means to make the Russians&#8217; 
positions accepted. Far from being the proof of the communist character of the 
sections of the Communist International, they testified to the presence and the 
overwhelming weight of the centrist mass parties which would soon take over the 
organizational tasks of the degenerating communist parties: the Bolsheviks would 
never forgive the Italian Communist Party for having prevented what was 
&#8220;achieved&#8221; by the PCF and the VKPD (cf. Chapter 17). It is too often forgotten 
that the 21 Conditions were directed against the Left as much as against the 
centrists (who would enter <i>en masse</i> and accept the 21 Conditions: the 
latter having served the purpose of isolating the Left). Among the Conditions, 
working in the trade unions and parliament were explicitly included (Conditions 
9 and 11), as well as support for &#8220;all colonial movements of emancipation&#8221;. 
Henceforth, being a communist would mean, among other things, being a trade 
unionist and a voter. But the defense of the Russian State did not yet, in fact, 
dominate the Russians&#8217; attitude: this decisive change would not take place until 
after 1921.</p>

<p class="fst">At first, the Russians expected to open the Executive Committee 
of the Communist International to KAPD delegates, but Levi&#8217;s opposition obliged 
them to grant the KAPD only a consultative vote (cf. Chapter 16). A few days 
later, the Russians again proposed granting votes to the KAPD, the IWW and the 
Shop Stewards Movement, but only the latter two groups were conceded the right 
to vote. Zinoviev&#8217;s speech on parliament and the trade unions criticized the 
French antiparliamentarians, the IWW and the SSM, although he considered them to 
be &#8220;friends and brothers&#8221;. This speech was followed by an arduous debate on the 
question of whether the British communists should join the <i>Labour Party</i>, 
which ended in victory for the proponents of affiliation, but only after a long 
and acrimonious debate which ended with the Left accepting this position without 
admitting its rationale, hoping (Pankhurst) that the Congress would return to 
the question for discussion at a later time. The Congress voted in favor of the 
resolution, 48 votes to 24: &#8220;It was not such an impressive victory for the 
Russians when one considers the vast arsenal which had been brought to bear 
against the &#8216;British Left&#8217;.&#8221;<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> We should not allow the violent ruptures which 
took place later to mislead us. At the time of the Second Congress, not only 
Bordiga (who, from a sense of discipline, accepted &#8220;revolutionary 
parliamentarism&#8221;), but also Pankhurst and Gorter (cf. the latter&#8217;s <i>Open 
Letter to Comrade Lenin</i>) thought that there were infinitely more shared 
views than divergences between their position and the Communist 
International&#8212;the Russians, they thought, made mistakes because they were 
extrapolating their situation to the other countries of the Communist 
International&#8212;and that experience would lead them to change their positions, 
especially since they expected that the movement would grow. Organizational 
fetishism appeared in all the currents of the Left, and not only in Germany. The 
PCI renounced its abstentionism, placing more value on the existence of a world 
center than on this tactical disagreement. Of course, submission to discipline 
makes no sense unless this center would act in a revolutionary way. Such was not 
to be the case. The PCI fought for a form, deceiving itself concerning its 
content: organizational fetishism. Excessive faith in the revolution, 
&#8220;automatism&#8221;, and sometimes the weakness of their theoretical tradition made the 
European communists yield to the Russians. The authority of the Russians, and 
among the Russians Lenin&#8217;s opinions, were frequently imposed without too much 
pressure: &#8220;whoever wanted to persist in holding an opinion which was different 
from that defended by the Russians, was sure to be isolated&#8221;, the KAPD&#8217;s 
representative on the Executive Committee of the Communist International, a 
delegate who spent several months in Russia in 1921, would declare long 
afterwards.<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> The Left tended to grant little importance to arrangements which 
it considered to be provisional. Soon, faced with the confirmation of the 
proletarian defeat, which seemed to vindicate the Communist International&#8217;s 
condemnation of the Left, the official policy appeared to be the only realistic 
one, and in retrospect the only one which might have prevented that defeat. The 
prudent counsel of the Communist International (&#8220;prepare yourselves&#8221;) would 
offer the prospect of permanent employment to a new generation, or to the older 
one which could not recycle itself back into the traditional workers movement.</p>

<p class="fst">A strong current in opposition to the centrists took shape at the 
Second Congress. The French delegate of the Socialist Youth, Goldenberg, decried 
the fact that the French communists had been attacked &#8220;precisely by those whom 
we intend to accept into the Third International for the sole reason ... that 
they display a verbal solidarity with its principles&#8221;. He also lamented &#8220;this 
artificial means of bringing undesirable elements into the International&#8221;.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a> 
Soon after the start of the debate concerning the USPD, after Wijnkoop&#8217;s speech, 
the Estonian Münzenberg warned the Congress against the danger &#8220;of diluting and 
weakening revolutionary propaganda and activity&#8221;. Lenin interrupted him: &#8220;And 
who is talking about admitting the USPD?&#8221; Münzenberg replied: &#8220;The debate in the 
Executive Committee has clearly proven it. The fact that comrades who only a few 
weeks or days ago were still fighting with every means at their disposal against 
the Third International, now declare themselves prepared to sign, without any 
reservations, the proposed conditions&#8212;this proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, 
that these conditions have not been formulated with sufficient precision.&#8221; 
Wijnkoop emphasized that if the KPD could criticize the USPD, the KAPD could do 
the same in respect to the KPD. &#8220;Is it totally correct&#8221;&#8212;he asked ironically&#8212;&#8220;to 
say that the KPD is always in the vanguard of the masses? This question must be 
posed here and it must have an answer. But this would undoubtedly be very 
difficult in the presence of the USPD. We are not alone, among ourselves, we 
find ourselves with these gentlemen, the government socialists. We must meet 
among ourselves alone and speak the truth to one another. But this has been 
rendered impossible by the Executive Committee&#8221; (by admitting the USPD into the 
Congress). Ultimately, despite the 21 Conditions, the KAPD was admitted as a 
sympathizing party into the Communist International.</p>

<p class="fst">The trade union debate, to some extent, concerned the United 
States. The <i>Communist Labor Party</i> (J. Reed) was close to the Left and was 
opposed by the <i>Communist Party</i> (Fraina), which defended working in the 
trade unions (concerning these two American parties, cf. Chapter 17). Reed was 
against working in the AFL, but ultimately accepted it in order to <i>destroy</i> 
that trade union federation and not to conquer it. The <i>Shop Stewards Movement</i> 
wanted to remain outside the reformist trade unions. Reed and Gallacher, of the 
Shop Stewards, &#8220;thought that there was no more reason to try to change the 
nature of the old trade unions than there was to try to change the nature of the 
capitalist State&#8221;.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> The CLP&#8217;s argument was unlike the position defended by 
the KAPD, as Bergmann would explain at the Third World Congress.<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a> It was 
based on the fact that only 20% of the workers in the USA were organized in 
trade unions: we should therefore organize the unorganized. This viewpoint was 
closer to that of the IWW than to that of the Communist Left, strictly 
understood. An Italian delegate, Bombacci, who was a trade union leader for many 
years, opposed Lenin, and denied that the trade unions had &#8220;any revolutionary 
function whatsoever&#8221;<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a>... The ensuing debate in the committee on the trade 
union question resulted in reciprocal concessions.</p>

<p class="fst">The Bolshevik position was also based on the conviction, shared 
by the Italian Left, that the trade unions (led by the Party) would be needed 
after the revolution to organize production and to represent the immediate 
interests of the workers. This was Lenin&#8217;s position in the debate at the 10<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> 
Congress of the Russian Communist Party in 1921.<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> Such a position was 
justified, at best, in a country like Russia, which is <i>not socialist</i>, but 
cannot be applied to a revolution in Western Europe. The problem in the latter 
case is not one of representing the workers but of organizing production and 
society. Such administrative tasks cannot be undertaken by a trade union: its 
whole anti-proletarian past (both by virtue of its organizational structure and 
its anti-communist activities) makes this impossible. Quite the contrary, after 
and by means of the indispensable destruction of the trade unions, new 
organizations will be born which will take control of production and the 
regulation of working conditions. By trying to supersede the trade union-party 
rupture, the radical German proletarians had at least vaguely perceived that the 
communist revolution was not a question of managing society, but of overthrowing 
all of its relations. Lenin, as well as Bordiga, at that time, never advanced 
beyond a leadership conception, which is but one aspect of the managerial 
conception.<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">However, unlike what is taking place today, it must be said in 
favor of Bordiga and Lenin that they were at least conscious of the goal: an 
economy without market exchange. The centralization of their forces, by means of 
the constitution of a leadership cadre, seemed to them to be the most economical 
road, and even the only possible one, to achieve this goal. Lenin criticized the 
&#8220;non-centralists&#8221; from a tactical point of view: their inability to resist the 
reaction. This view was very political and military and did not apply to a 
generalized revolutionary movement in which, as in Germany, the military 
dimension was only one aspect of an economic subversion. For Russia, as long as 
the revolution did not become a world revolution, Lenin&#8217;s position was correct: 
it was a question of administering political power in a society which could not 
be profoundly transformed, but had to be ruled as it existed, nonetheless. Of 
course, this position had to become false, when the hopes for a world revolution 
had evaporated. Bordiga implicitly went further in defending the need for the 
&#8220;party&#8221;: he was a critic of Proudhonism, and not just regarding the strategic 
problem of striking at the heart of the matter: the State.</p>

<p class="fst">In its essence, the German Left cannot be reduced to 
revolutionary syndicalism: it went beyond the economic-political rift. It is in 
this sense that one should understand the rule established by certain <i>unionen</i> 
that their members must acknowledge the principle of the dictatorship of the 
proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">At the Second Congress of the Communist International, the &#8220;Left&#8221; 
(taken in its widest sense) was split over the trade union question into two 
positions which sometimes overlapped. Must the old trade unions be destroyed or 
should new organizations be constructed which are both &#8220;trade unions&#8221; (acting in 
defense of the workers&#8217; immediate interests) and &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; (fighting for 
the communist revolution) at the same time? As in the case of the question of 
joining the Labour Party, the Left yielded. Reed declared: &#8220;The American and 
English delegates tried to introduce a new spirit into the old trade unions ... 
the communists must transform the trade unions or remain isolated.&#8221;<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a> In the 
plenary session, the Russians acted as if the committee had reached an 
agreement, which gave rise to vehement protests, which became more aggressive as 
the Bolsheviks sandbagged the debate (by increasing the number of Russian 
speakers). Gallacher, although he was inclined to favor affiliation, and would 
become one of the leaders of the British Communist Party for several decades, 
stated: &#8220;The English comrades have the impression that it was simply a matter of 
preventing debate.&#8221;<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a> The final resolution recommended that communists should 
be present in the trade unions and should join the Red Trade Union 
International. But the creation of this organization would only make the problem 
worse. Was it a new mass workers movement, radical yet still based on trade 
union activities, or was it situated beyond trade unionism? Was it an attempt to 
build a trade union international whose ultimate purpose was to replace the 
&#8220;yellow&#8221; International, created in July 1919, or was its goal only to regroup 
the minorities within the trade unions and to keep alive the hopes of conquering 
the old trade unions? The presence of observers and sympathizers from 
traditional revolutionary syndicalism (Spanish, Italian and French) did not make 
clarifying this issue any easier, and it would only be resolved under the 
pressure of events: the &#8220;communist&#8221; trade unions would become trade unions like 
all the others, confirming the fact that there is no such thing as an anti-trade 
union trade union.</p>

<p class="fst">&#8220;The real founding Congress&#8221; of the Communist International<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a> 
did not resolve any crucial problems. It ended without clarifying the trade 
union question due to a desire not to confront the trade unions,<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a> which were 
reluctant to yield to the Communist International&#8217;s will to control the trade 
union movement (some, because of a revolutionary conviction in favor of trade 
union autonomy&#8212;IWW, Rosmer&#8212;others because of their anti-revolutionary 
position&#8212;Italian CGL&#8212;others oscillating between these two views&#8212;the Spanish 
CNT). The Communist International and the Red Trade Union International would 
assume a defensive posture by allowing the reformist centrals to exclude the 
revolutionary trade unions or those which had joined the Red Trade Union 
International. In the name of the &#8220;unity&#8221; of the movement, they left all 
initiative in the hands of their adversaries, while their adversaries knew how 
to utilize the weapon of unity when they found it useful, and later forced 
splits when their interests required them.<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a> Pushed to the sidelines, the red 
trade unions could not exist unless they acted like trade unions: those 
organizations with revolutionary tendencies, even if they were, at times, 
contradictory, like the IWW, would disappear.</p>

<p class="fst">The weakness of the non-Russian revolutionary movement was 
manifested in the Communist International&#8217;s organizational structure, and was 
symbolized by the enormous weight of the Russians in the Executive Committee. 
Wijnkoop tried in vain to warn the delegates: &#8220;In reality, we are not building 
an international Executive Committee, but an enlarged Russian Executive 
Committee. I have suggested that the Communist International should have its 
headquarters outside of Russia, in Italy or Norway. Levi has proposed Germany... 
It is a very important question because we have given enormous power to this 
committee, even that of excommunicating individuals, groups or entire parties. 
This cannot be done without a precise knowledge of the domestic situation in 
each country.&#8221;<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a> The Executive Committee which was finally named was composed 
of 15 members, 5 of whom were Russians.</p>

<p class="fst">The Communist Parties were not &#8220;branches&#8221; of the Communist 
International. They had been formed <i>from within</i>, as outgrowths of the 
social movements in various countries, often with novel aspects. Despite 
appearances, it was the Communist International which had been formed by its 
sections, even though its construction was characterized by clashes. The idea of 
a &#8220;mold&#8221; conceals the movement which individuals and groups followed in joining 
the Communist International. One could ask why they accepted this mold. For 
example, their emphasis on education was well adapted to what was proposed or 
imposed by the Communist International, and corresponded to the practice of the 
classical socialist movement before and after 1914-1918. To guide, to convince, 
and then to <i>lead</i> the class: where the accent had been placed on 
education, the communist parties displaced it to organization. It was the same 
tendency, but extended. Lenin&#8217;s fundamental counterrevolutionary traits (the 
Kautskyist theory of consciousness being brought to the class from without) came 
from Europe, and all he did was systematize them. Except for a minority (the 
communist left), the post-1917 European revolutionaries did not criticize him: 
it was, then, inevitable that these conceptions would come to life again from 
the moment when the movement ebbed. The conception of an &#8220;elite&#8221; which leads the 
workers, however, was not limited to just the socialist movement. Before 1914 it 
was shared by <i>revolutionary syndicalism</i>. We quote Pouget:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Most people are sheep-like and unconscious. If by some chance 
they have ... moments of lucidity, it is under the influence of revolutionary 
minorities.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The revolutionary problem consists entirely in this: to build a 
minority which is strong enough to overthrow the minority of leaders.&#8221;<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The obsession with the rupture represented by the &#8220;Leninization&#8221; 
of a large part of the European, and even of the world&#8217;s workers movement, has 
led to an underestimation of its <i>continuity</i> with certain practices and 
conceptions which had roots, prior to 1914, among both socialists and trade 
unionists... Anarchosyndicalist <i>elitism</i> was one of the channels through 
which the Leninist conception of the party was transmitted and which would 
facilitate its imposition. If the CGTU rapidly came under the control of the 
PCF, and if the Shop Stewards Movement submitted to the leadership of the 
British Communist Party, it is not because these parties had practiced such 
clever manipulation: the educational orientation and the organization of 
conscious minorities had been almost naturally transferred from the trade union 
to the party.</p>
