<h3><a name="h1">The Dutch Left</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Not surprisingly, the theoretical (and, to some degree, the 
organizational) sources of the German Left originated not outside of the 
classical workers movement, or in its heartland, but in its periphery. They are 
of German-Dutch origin. Northern Germany and the southern part of the 
Netherlands have comprised an economically integrated region since the 16<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> 
century. During the millenarian movements of the 16<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century, 
subversive ideas and individuals spread from the south of Holland to the cities 
and states of Northwest Germany (Münster). Lenin was able to conceive a 
revolutionary strategy because his external position allowed him to take what 
was best from the European socialist movement without being completely swept 
away by it. But his Russian limitations led him into the same cul de sac as 
social democracy, all the more insofar as his revolutionary positions were 
contradictory: although a revolutionary, he shared the Kautskyist theory of 
class consciousness. The German-Dutch Left extracted the best from the German 
workers movement, and remained at that level. Unlike Lenin, it was at the center 
of the European communist movement. Unlike Luxemburg, however, it was not so 
immersed within social democracy as to be paralyzed by it.</p>

<p class="fst">In the Netherlands, the Social Democratic League (SDB), led by D. 
Nieuwenhuis, among others, gave way, in 1894, to the SDAP, after a struggle 
between Marxists and anarchists. Refusing to take either side, Nieuwenhuis, at 
the turn of the century, would warn of degeneration in his work, <i>Socialism in 
Danger</i>.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> The SDAP followed the same trajectory as the large parties in the 
Second International. At the end of the century, it was divided between 
revisionists and the orthodox (the latter being represented by the 
parliamentarian Troelstra, known as the &#8220;Dutch Kautsky&#8221;). Gorter and Henriette 
Roland-Holst, both poets, entered the party in 1897 and became the spokespersons 
for a new left wing tendency which attacked Troelstra&#8217;s supposedly radical 
center. They were joined by Pannekoek, who entered the Party in 1903, as well as 
by other future members of the Dutch CP including Van Ravensteyn and Wijnkoop.</p>

<p class="fst">Their organ was the journal <i>De Nieuwe Tijd</i>, to which <i>De 
Tribune</i> was added later (see below). This current attempted to go beyond 
traditional debates. In relation to the colonial question, for example, it did 
not restrict itself to endorsing the contemporary theory which held that 
capitalism was an &#8220;inevitable stage for the colonies in their march towards 
socialism ... if socialism were to triumph in the old world, it would be 
possible to avoid the miseries of capitalism on the other continents by sharing 
capitalism&#8217;s technological advantages with them. Gorter and Pijnappel agreed 
with Mendels, and said that his analysis agreed with Marx&#8217;s writings.&#8221;<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> Their 
analysis, in effect, returned to the view entertained by Marx, especially in 
regard to Russia.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> Gorter broached the theme of the proletariat&#8217;s isolation, 
which he would again address in his <i>Open Letter to Comrade Lenin</i>: 
&#8220;Attacking the Party&#8217;s illusions concerning the petite bourgeoisie and the 
peasants, Gorter stated in passing that a large part of this petite bourgeoisie 
had an interest in the products of the colonies ... annually making hundreds of 
millions from the Indies ...&#8221; The International&#8217;s Stuttgart Congress (1907), 
interpreted by Lenin as a healthy reaction against the Right, &#8220;opened the eyes 
of the Dutch Left.&#8221;<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> This development was not uniform, however: Roland-Holst, 
despite understanding the connection between German imperialism and the 
positions supported by the German socialists, concluded that the Congress had 
ended to the revolutionaries&#8217; advantage.</p>

<p class="fst">In its essentials, the German-Dutch Left (including Radek) held a 
position close to that of its Polish and Russian adversaries on the question of 
the right of nations or of &#8220;peoples&#8221; to self-determination. For Wiedijk: &#8220;the 
colonial question is essentially situated, not in the colonies themselves, but 
in the colonizing countries, where the most important interests are at stake... 
Colonial reform cannot come before class struggle.&#8221;<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> Lenin was quite isolated 
on this issue. The other Bolsheviks did not accept the defense of the absolute 
right to self-determination before the revolution. Always on the lookout for 
anything which could undermine the power of the leading capitalist countries and 
lend support to the proletarian struggle, Lenin tried to find substitutes for 
proletarian action. He saw the centrifugal role which nationalist forces could 
play to weaken the Russian State, for instance. But this kind of realism 
overlooked capital&#8217;s ability to contain the proletariat within national borders. 
His theses on the national question derived from his position on democracy. In 
the internal Bolshevik polemic on this theme in 1915-1916, he denounced &#8220;the 
scornful attitude of imperialist economism in respect to democracy&#8221;, which will 
be indispensable in &#8220;educating&#8221; the proletarians.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Marxist solution to the democracy question consists in the <i>
utilization</i>, on the part of the proletariat conducting its class struggle, 
of all democratic <i>institutions</i> and aspirations against the bourgeoisie... 
As for the Marxists, they know that democracy does not eliminate class 
oppression, but only makes the class struggle clearer, more extensive, more 
open; it is what we need... The more democratic the regime, the more obvious, 
for the workers, is the origin of the evil which is capitalism...&#8221;<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The creation of a democratic national state thus constitutes 
progress, since such a state would then become a framework within which the 
proletariat could organize and educate itself. The proletariat needs democratic <i>
States</i> because it needs democracy. For Pannekoek, however, the national 
solution is utopian under the regime of capital, because every nation is at war 
with the others and oppresses its own minorities. In 1912, his critique of the 
projects for cultural autonomy in the Austro-Hungarian Empire was also an 
indirect critique of Lenin: &#8220;<i>It is not our advocacy of national autonomy, 
whose realization does not depend on us, but only the strengthening of class 
consciousness which will really smash the terrible power of nationalism to 
pieces</i>. It would be false to want to concentrate all our efforts on a 
&#8216;positive national policy&#8217; and to stake everything on ... the realization of our 
program for national self-determination as a precondition for class 
struggle.&#8221;<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the same year J. Strasser, an Austrian left-socialist,<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> 
published a similar text, in which he simultaneously attacked the federalism of 
Austrian social democracy (which sought the means to preserve the unity of the 
empire in concessions to the other nationalities), the nationalism of Czech 
social democracy and the supporters of pan-German unification. The socialist 
party, Strasser wrote, must be centralized, and all national solutions are 
illusory: &#8220;it is not true that nations can in any circumstance live side by side 
without becoming rivals. In bourgeois society, each nation accuses the others of 
expansionist tendencies, and even aggression, whenever they get in each others&#8217; 
way. Every national struggle makes a mockery of revisionist internationalism. 
What, then, will the proletariat do when the struggle between nationalities 
breaks out?&#8221;<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">During the war, Pannekoek did not participate in the debate on 
the national question. Lenin stated with satisfaction that while Gorter was 
against the principle of self-determination, he nonetheless allowed for it in 
the case of colonialism; for the Dutch East Indies, for example.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> Like the 
German Left he was not directly confronted by the reality of the national 
question, unlike the Russians, the Poles and the Austrians, nor was it a crucial 
theme in his experience or activity. Each time he systematically investigated 
the question, however, he did so in the sense of this observation of Bukharin&#8217;s: 
if the &#8220;right of nations&#8221; is not an empty, meaningless term, it must include the 
compulsory defense of the national State, and end in the demand for patriotism 
or, which is the same thing, in the absurd position of the revolutionaries&#8217; 
denial of internationalism.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> The only meaning which the slogan of 
self-determination can have is opposed to the revolution. Bukharin was more 
aware than Lenin of the integral connection which existed between organized 
capitalism and <i>any</i> State, large or small.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Within the SDAP, the conflicts between the left and the center 
became increasingly acute. In 1901 they revolved around the agrarian question: 
the left refused to oppose the expropriation of small farmers for the purpose of 
the development of modern capitalist agriculture. It was not the Party&#8217;s job to 
incite the small-scale peasants to unite in defense of the small family farm, 
but to fight for socialism. This debate would be taken up again in the <i>Open 
Letter to Comrade Lenin</i>. On the education question (1902), the Left rejected 
any concessions to religious schools, which were desired by the Party&#8217;s 
leadership for reasons having to do with electoral deals. In 1903 the Left 
turned against the trade unions which sabotaged a railroad strike. Finally, in 
1905, in the debate over the parliamentary question, it violently denounced the 
alliance with the radical bourgeois parties in the run-off elections, which 
granted a majority to the radicals against the Right. As these trade union and 
parliamentary trends were to continue to unfold (the same kind of alliance was 
made in the German elections of 1912), the Left would become abstentionist and 
critical of the trade unions.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1907 the Left established its own newspaper: <i>De Tribune</i> 
(whence the name &#8220;Tribunists&#8221;), which was particularly vehement in its attacks 
on the Party&#8217;s leadership. An extraordinary Congress of the Party in 1909 
demanded that it cease publication. With the exception of a small circle around 
Roland-Holst, which would not join the others until some time later, the whole 
left wing left the Party and founded the Social Democratic Party (SDP). It was a 
&#8220;groupuscule&#8221;: it had no more than 700 members in contrast to the 25,000 members 
of the SDAP in 1913. It was not accepted as a member by the International, 
despite the support of the Bolsheviks, another schismatic party. Its application 
having been presented to the Bureau of the Socialist International in 1909, the 
latter was confronted by two motions. The motion of the SDP and the German SPD, 
which was supported by Lenin, was in favor of the new party&#8217;s petition for 
affiliation: but the opposition motion, presented by the Austrian V. Adler, 
obtained a majority. Luxemburg condemned the split in the name of Party 
unity.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> The SDP did, however, engage in parliamentary activity. In 1918 it 
would become the Communist Party of the Netherlands (KPN), with two seats in 
Parliament. In 1919 Gorter denounced the <i>opportunism of the Dutch communist 
party</i>. His attack included, among other themes, the notion of a &#8220;pure&#8221; and 
&#8220;clear&#8221; &#8220;nucleus&#8221; which would be further developed in 1920-1921.</p>

<p class="fst">For her part, Roland-Holst occupied an intermediate position, 
somewhat like that of Trotsky in Russia, and, like the latter, would join the 
Left in 1917. She was, however, on the side of the Bolsheviks with the 
Zimmerwald Left (see the next chapter). Later, she would take the middle road 
between the communist left and the Communist International.</p>

<p class="fst">The significance of the Dutch Left is above all <i>theoretical</i> 
and <i>international</i>. The Dutch would provide a meeting place for the 
socialist opposition during the war; the Netherlands did not take part in the 
conflict. It was in Amsterdam that the Western European Bureau of the Third 
International would be founded (see Chapter 11), and it would be dominated by 
the Left. The SDP provided the Left&#8217;s two leading theoreticians in Northern 
Europe: Gorter and Pannekoek. Gorter was the theoretician of the SDP, while 
Wijnkoop and Van Ravensteyn were its political leaders. Gorter was the author of <i>
The Fundamentals of Social Democracy</i> (1905; reprinted in 1920 under the 
title, <i>The Fundamentals of Communism</i>), <i>Historical Materialism for 
Workers</i> (1909), and <i>Social Democracy and Revisionism</i> (1909). As a 
leader of the KAPD he would direct the latter&#8217;s negotiations with the CI. Later, 
he would found the <i>Communist Workers International</i> (the KAI, in 
German).<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">Bremen</a></h3>

<p class="fst">There are now some important historical works dealing with 
Pannekoek: we shall only focus on what distinguished him, even before the war, 
from the Luxemburgist Left. Almost from the start of his political activity, in 
1904, he worked for the most part in Germany as a teacher of Marxism in the 
SPD&#8217;s Party Schools. With Luxemburg, he criticized the Kautskyist leadership of 
the Party, and was the spokesperson for a small group centered mainly in Bremen, 
whose organ was the <i>Bremer Bürger-Zeitung</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Pannekoek and Radek attacked Kautsky in the <i>Bremer 
Bürger-Zeitung</i>, particularly in regard to international issues and 
imperialism, and posed the problem of the possible relation between war and 
revolution: &#8220;The struggle against imperialism does not have the purpose of 
hindering its development, but of mobilizing the masses against it...&#8221;<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> This 
position, expressed by Pannekoek in 1910, would be taken up by Lenin in 1914. Of 
Polish origin, Radek was excluded from Polish Social Democracy in 1912 for 
embezzlement. He had previously been a supporter of the Warsaw Group which was 
at that time close to the Bolsheviks and opposed to the (Luxemburgist) Party 
leadership. He was excluded from the Party the following year, despite 
Pannekoek&#8217;s protests. A Russo-Polish court of honor ruled in his favor in 
1915.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> He went to Switzerland during the war. In 1914-15, he was against the 
principle of self-determination, for Poland as well as in general. His 
interpretation of the Easter Rebellion in Ireland in 1916 was in opposition to 
Lenin&#8217;s.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1912, Pannekoek was among the first to connect the class 
struggle in Europe to the independence movement in the colonies: only by joining 
with the proletariat in the highly-developed countries could the struggles in 
the backward countries acquire a socialist character.<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> This position was 
quite unlike both Lenin&#8217;s view as well as that of the other members of the Dutch 
left wing, which is outlined below, and which could at times border on <i>
indifference</i> concerning underdeveloped regions.</p>

<p class="fst">The left-wing current which would coalesce in the KPD was born 
long before 1918-19, and by virtue of its actions had already demarcated itself 
from the first (Luxemburgist) leadership of the Party.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> The communist left 
which appeared after 1917 was not, therefore, without roots in the previous 
epoch. What is called the &#8220;communist left&#8221; became the communist left prior to 
1914 through contact with other left currents (particularly those of Lenin and 
Luxemburg), and these currents mutually influenced one another. The 
revolutionary currents which would confront one another after 1917 had to a 
great extent already known and opposed one another before 1917, in relation to 
the national question, among other issues. Pannekoek made extensive 
contributions to the polemics on this question. By criticizing &#8220;infantile 
leftism&#8221;, Lenin was continuing a debate which started a dozen years earlier.</p>

<p class="fst">Pannekoek distinguished himself from the Luxemburgist Left on two 
important points. He thought that radical elements should abandon social 
democracy and regroup outside it. Luxemburg, however, condemned the SDP&#8217;s 
schism: one must persevere wherever the masses are found: &#8220;one cannot remain 
outside the organization, one must not lose contact with the masses... The worst 
workers party is better than no party at all.&#8221;<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> This presaged the rupture 
between the Spartacus League and the ISD, and later that between the KPD and the 
KAPD.</p>

<p class="fst">An important polemic also set Pannekoek against Luxemburg, 
concerning the theory of the &#8220;final crisis&#8221; of capital, as expounded in <i>The 
Accumulation of Capital</i>.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> Pannekoek criticized it on two levels. On the 
&#8220;mathematical&#8221; level, Luxemburg took as her starting point one of Marx&#8217;s 
&#8220;errors&#8221; in his accumulation schemas in Sections 2 and 3 of Volume II of <i>
Capital</i>. Defending Marx, Pannekoek showed that it was impossible to prove 
that capital&#8217;s movement must of necessity come to a halt should it be deprived 
of possibilities for expansion outside of the &#8220;capitalist zone&#8221;. Without, 
however, making the proletarian movement the motive force of history, he 
criticized the idea that one could speak of the crisis of capital in purely 
economic terms, as well as the content which Luxemburg conferred upon necessity. 
According to Luxemburg, the necessity which drives capitalism towards collapse 
is mechanistic: the proletariat is not included as one of its factors. Her 
catastrophic vision overlooks this factor although it is an element even at the 
&#8220;purely economic&#8221; level. Pannekoek would return to this theme much later, 
explaining this concept of mechanistic necessity as a resurgence, on the 
theoretical plane, of a typically social democratic trait which Luxemburg 
criticized on the political plane: Kautskyist fatalism, the negation of the 
revolutionary character of the proletariat.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> Nonetheless, after the war, and 
unlike the case of the first divergence summarized above, the German Left 
(although opposed to Luxemburg&#8217;s tactics), would again take up the Luxemburgist 
thesis, simplifying it instead of developing it, under the rubric of the &#8220;death 
crisis&#8221; of capitalism.<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Paradoxically, a historian (Schurer) has viewed Pannekoek as one 
of the precursors and founders of &#8220;Leninism&#8221;.<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> Bricianer was right to reject 
this hasty assimilation, but did not go far enough in his examination of the 
genesis of the Left prior to 1914.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a> Schurer relies upon real analogies, which 
do not, however, justify his comparison of Lenin and Pannekoek, even before 
1914. It is true that each was opposed to the Luxemburgist theory of 
imperialism; and that Pannekoek was undoubtedly the first to grant importance to 
the notion of a &#8220;labor aristocracy&#8221;, and in particular was the first as well to 
once again resuscitate Marx&#8217;s thesis on the need to destroy the State. But he 
approached these questions in a way dissimilar to that of Lenin.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Tactical Differences in the Workers Movement</i> (1909) 
effectively examined the root of the reformist tendency, which Pannekoek 
attributed to the weight of the middle classes, and of the employees and 
officials of the workers movement; on the other side, the workers in large 
industry constituted the revolutionary nucleus. Lenin, however, in<i> Marxism 
and Revisionism</i> (1908), insisted upon the role of the petite bourgeoisie. 
Even more than &#8220;small-scale production&#8221;, which Lenin would never cease to 
discuss (even in <i>Infantile Disorder</i>), Pannekoek showed that it is the 
very mode of existence of the workers in a non-revolutionary period which 
defines the nature of the &#8220;labor aristocracy&#8221;. Merely by virtue of their 
numbers, the workers must join together into a bloc (in fact, into numerous <i>
rival</i> blocs) which requires representatives to deal with capitalists and the 
State, from whom concessions must be wrested. The workers bureaucracy was more 
than a kind of activity or a leader-masses relationship; it was above all 
sociologically a relation in which a privileged, entrenched minority was formed. 
In the higher ranks, the leaders even hoped to enter the bourgeoisie, even if 
this hope was based on nothing but the inevitable financial and commercial 
activities of the workers movement, through the funds which it absorbed: social 
welfare, sick benefits, cultural centers, publishing, etc. In the lower ranks, 
the cadres possessed socio-cultural means for the advancement of their 
offspring. It is in this sense that one can speak of a social layer which <i>
reproduces</i> <i>itself</i> as privileged, and not simply of categories which 
enjoy more advantages than others.</p>

<p class="fst">The notion of a &#8220;labor aristocracy&#8221; was frequently employed in 
England during the 1880s to designate a quite numerous minority of &#8220;artisans 
(skilled workers and craftsmen) and above all those who were members of the 
trade unions and other labor organizations&#8221;.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> The privileged social layer(s) 
varied from country to country depending on the background of the working class 
and its organizations, and in 1890 Engels invoked the &#8220;aristocratic minority&#8221; of 
unionized workers.<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a> In the United States, this issue was inseparable from 
that of racial and ethnic minorities: in England Marx also emphasized the 
antagonism between the English and the Irish.<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a> What was new about Engels&#8217; 
1892 Preface to <i>The Condition of the Working Class in England</i> was his 
connecting this phenomenon to British industrial monopoly: a thesis appropriated 
by Lenin. In that same year, Wilhelm Liebknecht declared at the Socialist 
Congress: &#8220;The majority of you are certainly, for the most part, aristocrats of 
labor, insofar as income is concerned.&#8221;<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> The German Left went beyond a 
sociological view in understanding that a certain kind of workers struggle, in a 
calm period, gives rise to structures which immediately turn against the 
revolution. Lenin, on the other hand, saw in this phenomenon nothing but the 
corruption of one part of the workers who held the leadership of the movement: 
he might have asked himself how this minority could have led the movement 
against the wishes of the majority. In regard to which Lenin logically deduced 
that one must re-conquer these organizations, while the Left perceived them as 
the products of a non-revolutionary phase and, consequently, as structures which 
must be destroyed. Luxemburg, although she emphasized the trade unions&#8217; 
regressive role, did not address this problem (see <i>Reform and Revolution</i>). 
But her opposition to the trade unions had its origin in her distrust of purely 
economic action, since she saw this as jeopardizing socialist <i>education</i>. 
The respect (in her case one cannot speak of fetishism<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a>) which Luxemburg had 
for the existing workers organizations, and which was well-evidenced by her 
refusal to create new schismatic organizations, was an aspect of her fetishism 
of education which she shared with the immense majority of the revolutionaries 
of her time.</p>

<p class="fst">Between 1910 and 1912, Pannekoek made a theoretical 
&#8220;breakthrough&#8221; by evoking the proletariat&#8217;s need to create new organs of power, 
which meant that the proletariat could not use parliament as a political form. 
Pannekoek defined the proletariat&#8217;s need to exercise <i>Machtmittel</i>, 
instruments of force or of power, which Bricianer translated as &#8220;elements of 
force&#8221;.<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a> Such an idea illustrates the complexity of Pannekoek&#8217;s thought and 
the twists and turns of subversive theory. Much later, Bordiga would define the 
communist movement as a question of &#8220;force&#8221; rather than one of &#8220;form&#8221;.<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a> Lenin 
rendered homage to Pannekoek in 1917, in <i>State and Revolution</i>, but also 
accused him of not having drawn all the conclusions which follow from this idea. 
The critique was probably justified, but Lenin continued to nourish illusions 
about the pre-1914 socialist movement. Pannekoek, furthermore, implicitly 
criticized Kautsky&#8217;s (and also Lenin&#8217;s) view of class consciousness. His great 
merit was having discerned communism in the nature of the class, and not just as 
a <i>program</i>. But rather than in its deepest being he discerned it in its 
organization. His preoccupation with &#8220;spontaneity&#8221; was not focused on the 
self-destruction of the proletariat as such: that is, as commodified human 
activity reappropriating the means of life and with these its humanity. He 
discerned the rise of the proletariat in its forms rather than its content, 
because its content was hardly discernable in that era.</p>

<p class="fst">In September, 1918, Radek recognized Pannekoek&#8217;s contribution, 
saying that the existing political forms, even the most democratic, must not be 
used, although he did not say what new institutions would replace them. But 
these two questions&#8212;the State and the labor aristocracy&#8212;highlighted the 
differences between Lenin and Pannekoek. Lenin was animated by the will to seize 
power, which involved advocating the destruction of the old State (and not its 
conquest as he had long thought, thus imitating almost all the world&#8217;s social 
democrats). But he did not understand the &#8220;how&#8221;, he did not see what was 
potentially contradictory in the proletariat&#8217;s being which would rise to the 
fore in a revolutionary period: this explains his exaggeration of the 
&#8220;Party&#8221;.<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a> Quite unlike his usual views on the matter, the short shrift given 
to the idea of the Party in <i>State and Revolution</i> is neither a trick to 
flatter the workers nor something positive about which one should be pleased. <i>
State and Revolution</i> simply testifies to one facet of Lenin&#8217;s contradiction, 
sometimes inclining towards an exaggeration of the role of the Party (<i>What is 
to be Done?</i>), and at other times allowing for democratic self-management (<i>State 
and Revolution</i>, which does not prevent this book from being an excellent 
revolutionary text). The way he dealt with the example of the Commune is 
significant; he once again took up Marx&#8217;s position, which is, however, 
susceptible to criticism, in <i>The Civil War in France</i>.<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a> Pannekoek, 
however, did not explicitly refer to 1871, concerning which he had a more lucid 
and quite well-justified judgment.<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a> It is also true that his ideas about the 
labor aristocracy had influenced Lenin and Zinoviev,<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a> but Pannekoek viewed 
the issue from a different angle. Later experience would show that Lenin and 
Pannekoek would deduce the opposite conclusions from their analyses of the labor 
aristocracy. What is essential is not denouncing a privileged minority, but 
understanding the (inevitable) expansion of reformist activity among all the 
workers organized in trade unions, parties, etc., and seeing that the revolution 
must be made outside of these institutions. Between 1910 and 1912, Pannekoek 
began to be aware of this, denying that the trade unions and parties could be 
used as structures of proletarian power: the proletariat must therefore create 
new organs for this purpose. He would later understand that the revolution must 
be made not <i>outside</i> of the classical organizations, but <i>against</i> 
them. Lenin, on the other hand, fought and would continue to fight for the 
impossible conquest of these organizations, upon certain class bases, and 
through the creation of &#8220;new&#8221; trade-union-type organizations, which involved the 
same kind of activity conducted by the old reformist trade unions, which is to 
say reformist activity.</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin did not understand the proletarian experience of his time 
in its most profound aspects. He was only able to theorize a few of its most 
essential orientations: his best efforts (his defeatist position in 1914) were <i>
negative</i>. From the moment that the proletariat of the advanced capitalist 
countries engaged in revolutionary action, Lenin was superseded. Then, at that 
precise moment, although he was not situated at the most advanced stage attained 
by the movement, he imposed his will. Lenin&#8217;s success at the head of the Russian 
Party and the CI is the theoretical and organizational expression of the 
historical compromise: the proletariat <i>attacked</i> society without <i>
destroying it</i>. This is why Lenin became the highest expression of a <i>
combative</i> but not a <i>communist</i> movement. The experiences acquired 
during this assault would survive, but they would be deformed and truncated by 
capital: this is Leninism, a tendency which was nonetheless revolutionary in its 
origins, despite its weak points. The communist left, however, the expression of 
the most radical but also one of the least popular aspects of the movement, 
would be crushed.</p>

of a private and confidential character: cf. <i>La Commune de 1871</i>, UGE, 
1971. In 1905, Lenin warned against imitating the Commune: &#8220;it was a movement
