<h1>The KAPD&#8217;s Report<br>
on the Third Congress<br>
of the Communist International<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></h1>

<hr>

<p class="fst">At the meeting of the KAPD Central Committee on July 31, 1921, a 
KAPD delegate to the Congress of the Third International presented the following 
report. The complete and definitive version of the KAPD&#8217;s report will be 
published as a pamphlet after the other delegates return from Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">Comrades!</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD delegation arrived in Moscow before the Congress in 
order to become acquainted with all the problems relating to Russia and the 
international workers movement as a whole; to get an accurate idea of the 
current situation by means of an exchange of viewpoints with the other 
delegations as they were arriving, so as to rectify the attacks and distortions 
to which the KAPD has been subjected, and to clearly set forth our point of view 
to the other delegates during the course of individual discussions. All of these 
tasks have been impossible within the confines of the Third International; it 
was necessary to make the most of the occasion. In fact, even after we arrived 
in Moscow, the daily newspaper of the Congress and various Russian government 
journals continued to attack the KAPD and distort its positions. We arrived in 
Russia in mid-May with the following missions: 1) <i>attacking the decisions of 
the Second Congress of the Third International</i>; 2) <i>establishing, to the 
greatest possible extent, an opposition within the Third International</i>. The 
delegation did not succumb to the illusion that it was possible to radically 
modify the official positions and Theses of the Second Congress; it had to 
emphatically insist upon battling against them, nonetheless.</p>

<p class="fst">We devoted our greatest efforts to the second task mentioned 
above (establishing an opposition). In the course of our discussions with the 
delegations from Bulgaria, Mexico, Spain, Luxembourg, England, Glasgow, the 
Bulgarian Group and the IWW (Industrial Workers of the World), it became clear 
that we share some points in common with all these groups. The &#8220;Bulgarian Lefts&#8221; 
are closest to our positions. Their understanding of the Mexican situation is 
exactly the same as ours. The Bulgarian organizations are not actual &#8220;unions&#8221;, 
but coordinating bodies composed of syndicalists, anarchists and shop stewards. 
The relation between these organizations and the party is more or less such as 
we have tried to achieve: it is the party which directs the movement.</p>

<p class="fst">After the Bulgarian comrades, it was the <i>Spanish comrades</i> 
whose positions were closest to ours. They understood us perfectly. There is 
just one problem: the concept of the need for a political organization has yet 
to be generally accepted in Spain; but it is gaining ground. The comrades find 
themselves beyond trade unionism, on the road to communism. Their organization 
has 1,100,000 members: approximately 50% of all the organized workers in Spain.</p>

<p class="fst">
The comrades from Luxembourg are convinced advocates of factory organizations 
which are closely linked to the party. There is a &#8220;good&#8221; workers movement in 
Luxembourg, and its delegates assured us that they wanted to stay in close 
contact with us.</p>

<p class="fst">The <i>Glasgow Group</i> agrees with us on the theoretical level, 
but their organization is not very cohesive. The <i>Belgian representatives</i>, 
during the course of our first discussions with them, proved to be in complete 
agreement with our principles and tactics; they stated, however, that our 
methods of struggle were not yet applicable in their country.</p>

<p class="fst">The IWW was vehemently opposed to the positions of the Third 
International. It has a rather syndicalist character, but its delegates have 
admitted that a political organization is necessary for leading class struggles; 
they intend to study our experiences and draw the appropriate lessons. They 
asked us for political material. We also held interviews with comrade 
Roland-Holst, of the Dutch minority faction; and with some members of the 
Austrian delegation, with whom we were able to establish some points of 
agreement.</p>

<p class="fst">After these separate discussions with each delegation, we held an 
open forum. It was then that we came to clearly understand that the idea of 
forming an opposition within the Third International was an illusion, even 
though the delegates, considered separately, were in theoretical accord with our 
views. As it became clear to them that our discussions were meant to lead to the 
representation of a point of view in emphatic opposition to the Third 
International, they became frightened and balked. We then tried to create a 
framework for opposition on the basis of three themes: parliamentarism, trade 
unions and ultra-centralism. This did not succeed either. Finally, we attempted 
to obtain a homogeneous position on the part of all the opposition groups on 
just one of these themes. The most promising one in this respect was the 
question of parliamentarism. But this attempt failed as well. Everyone was 
afraid of being excluded from the Third International. It was then that, more 
clearly than ever, we realized how right we were to break with the Spartacus 
League. Within the Third International, if the Theses of the Second Congress are 
accepted, it is impossible to express an opinion other than that of the Russian 
Communist Party.</p>

<p class="fst">All of which leads us to just one conclusion: we, the KAPD, stand 
alone. <i>We must therefore abandon our mission to found an opposition</i>. But 
we should not conclude that the KAPD&#8217;s representation at the Congress was 
unjustified, or that we should have behaved like Rühle did at the Second 
Congress. We simply understand that we can only rely upon ourselves, and that 
our task has become much more difficult, but also much more necessary. It was 
necessary to force the Third International to clearly reveal its opportunism, to 
show by means of its exclusion of the KAPD, the impossibility of an independent 
revolutionary organization remaining within the Third International.</p>

<p class="fst">Since we had foreseen that we would only be allowed to speak for 
the minimum allotted time period, we used other means to make the delegates 
aware of the principles and methods of action of the KAPD. To this end, we 
composed outline presentations of all the important problems, theses and 
principle guidelines of the KAPD (see Volume No. 7 of <i>Proletarier</i>, the 
theoretical journal of the KAPD) as well as a report on the Communist Workers 
Party (the KAPD). These works were translated into English and French and were 
printed in large numbers and were distributed to many delegates.</p>

<p class="fst">Prior to the opening of the Congress, the Executive Committee 
held many meetings, in which all the members of our delegation participated. The 
line which the Congress would adopt could be seen at these meetings. Before we 
left Germany we had conceived a dual hypothesis concerning the Congress: either 
the Third International would inaugurate a new, more activist policy, or it 
would plunge deeper into the old orientation. As it turned out, <i>even the hope 
for a reactivation of the Third International&#8212;a hope which could have been kept 
alive by the recognition of the March Action&#8212;</i>seemed to be illusory.</p>

<p class="fst">After overcoming incredible difficulties, we managed to obtain an 
interview with Lenin prior to the opening day of the Congress. <i>During the 
course of this interview, Lenin declared that Levi was basically totally correct 
in his position against the March Action; and that he had only violated party 
discipline and thus committed an act which could not go unpunished.</i></p>

<p class="fst">This constituted an important sign for us, since Lenin&#8217;s 
authority is unquestioned within the Russian Communist Party.</p>

<p class="fst">This state of affairs was further illustrated by the attitude of 
the Russian representatives on the Executive Committee. The comrades of the 
French Youth group and certain elements of the French party, for example, 
criticized the party&#8217;s leadership: it had remained inactive at the moment of 
class mobilization in 1919. The delegates from Luxembourg also formulated 
serious accusations against the French party. When the workers of Luxembourg 
occupied the factories in March and the French Army intervened, the leadership 
of the French party remained mere spectators and did nothing. When these 
complaints were brought up for debate, Trotsky took Loriot&#8217;s side against the 
French Youth and Luxembourg delegates; he even reproached the latter for 
harboring nationalist motivations. Lenin also openly favored Loriot. Previously, 
Bela Kun, Radek and Zinoviev had mildly criticized Loriot. But from the moment 
that Trotsky and Lenin expressed their views, they shut their mouths. This sort 
of immobilizing opportunism also made its appearance in relation to the issue of 
the Czechoslovakian party, led by Sméral, who is a complete rightist.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> The 
fact that the social-democratic rightists dominated this party and that they 
were allowed to enter the International was not mentioned at all... A mild 
resolution was presented, however, in which some observations were made 
concerning Sméral and the rightists. (Immediately afterwards, during the 
Congress proceedings, the resolution was vacated of all meaning, even omitting 
the part which was directed against Sméral: the Czechoslovakian delegation had 
demanded that it be revised in this manner and Lenin himself intervened on their 
behalf). These examples should suffice. The Executive Committee also determined 
the structure of the Congress proceedings. <i>The political bureau of the 
Executive Committee made the proposals and, naturally, no one ventured to 
formulate the slightest revision of its proposals</i>. This was how the various 
committees were constituted. We sent representatives to the following 
committees: the committee for preparing the report of the Executive Committee, 
the committee on the world economic situation, the committee on tactics, the 
committee on the trade union question, the committee on organization, and the 
committee on the tactics of the RCP. We presented our theses to all these 
committees. But we could not present them before the whole Congress assembly. 
The Congress only heard the theses submitted by the Executive Committee itself.</p>

<p class="fst">We proposed to the Executive Committee that we should be 
permitted to present supplementary summaries on certain issues. We were told 
that we had to do this in the committees. But the committees, once formed, never 
actually functioned (except for the committee on the economic situation).</p>

<p class="fst">The first session of the Executive Committee took place in the 
Bolshoi Theater. It was an entire day of opening ceremonies; Zinoviev opened the 
Congress by delivering a speech summarizing the history of the Third 
International. The various delegates presented reports on the situations in 
their respective countries. The session ended with a performance by Russia&#8217;s 
most eminent artists. Chaliapin (the Russian Caruso) aroused the most 
enthusiastic response. As the concluding act, the whole Congress was taught to 
sing a popular Russian folk song. To summarize: the day began with Zinoviev, and 
closed with Chaliapin. Despite all of these diversions it was not merely a day 
of ceremony, as, in the midst of all the confusion the rules of order were 
established and the Presidium of the Congress was elected.</p>

<p class="fst">On the second day, Trotsky presented a three-and-one-quarter-hour 
report on the <i>world economic situation</i>. Among the particular points, 
whether outstanding or not, of his speech, its central point eventually clearly 
emerged: <i>the proletariat must come to terms with the fact that the revolution 
would be long-delayed and that, consequently, it must adopt a tactic of 
long-term preparation</i> due to the fact that capitalism had recovered its 
strength and overcome its difficulties. As proof of the superficiality of 
Trotsky&#8217;s analysis (which underestimates the new international alliance of world 
capital), we quote the following passage of his speech, in which he prophesies, 
with the precision of a railroad timetable, the outbreak of the Anglo-American 
War:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In 1924, the tonnage of the American fleet, according to its own 
program, will be significantly greater than that of the English and Japanese 
fleets combined. England&#8217;s guiding principle has until now consisted in assuring 
that its fleet is more powerful than that of the next two largest fleets 
together. Many Americans in the Democratic Party are bragging: in 1923, or maybe 
even by the end of 1922, we will be as strong as England. In any case, England&#8217;s <i>
memento mori</i><a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> is written on the agenda: if you let this happen, you are 
lost.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Before the war, we had an armed peace. People said: there are 
two trains heading towards each other on the same rails, they will crash into 
each other. But it was not observed that, between their respective positions, 
there was a station. The time was not indicated on the timetable. On this 
occasion, we have it on paper or on world history&#8217;s calendar. This should take 
place in 1923 or 1924. Either England will say: I will be pushed aside and 
become a second-rank power; or, to the contrary, England must employ all the 
forces inherited from its great past in the game of war and stake its whole 
destiny on this card for a limited period of time.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Our report on the same topic was not accepted. Since speaking 
time was limited to ten minutes per person, we applied the following tactic: we 
split up our report and had several comrades share the task of reading our 
report; thus, two comrades from the KAPD spoke (the speeches of comrades Sachs 
and Seeman are published in <i>Kampfruf</i>,<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> issues Nos. 14 and 15<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a>).</p>

<p class="fst">Our delegation had already presented a critique of Trotsky&#8217;s 
theses on the world economic situation during the committee&#8217;s proceedings (this 
critique is published in No. 218 of this journal). They were subjected to many 
criticisms, but Trotsky continued to assert that his theses must be adopted <i>
in principle</i>. They could not be subjected to corrections, except in matters 
of style or wording. Even though Frölich, of the VKPD, expressed his opposition, 
the theses were immediately adopted in principle, in accordance with Trotsky&#8217;s 
proposal. At the moment this question came up for a vote, a rupture emerged in 
the VKPD delegation.</p>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile, the <i>credentials committee</i> presented its report. 
Radek&#8217;s explanation of the problem involving the admission of the Bulgarian 
&#8220;leftists&#8221; is quite characteristic of this committee&#8217;s work: &#8220;The group of the 
alleged Bulgarian &#8216;leftists&#8217; cannot mention any activity of their own, and we 
have considered it to be totally inappropriate to reward people who have carried 
out a project of disorganization by giving them a consultative voice in the 
Congress.&#8221; The admission of the Bulgarian &#8220;leftists&#8221; was rejected; it was the 
Communist Party of Bulgaria, of a purely social democratic character, which 
would constitute the official section of the Third International.</p>

<p class="fst">Afterwards, the report of the Executive Committee was presented. 
Zinoviev reported on the Executive Committee&#8217;s activities over the last few 
years, defending the Executive Committee&#8217;s point of view on strict compliance 
with the 21 Conditions, making special reference to the Italian party, the 
&#8220;March Action&#8221; and the KAPD. Later, the Executive Committee&#8217;s position 
throughout the year received its critique in the practical form of the offer 
that the Italian Socialist Party would be readmitted to the Third International 
upon the condition that it should sacrifice Serrati. <i>Just as the Executive 
Committee&#8217;s harsh attacks against Levi and his cohorts were skillfully replaced 
by the accusation of having &#8220;violated discipline&#8221;. It treated them gently and 
even soon thereafter came to fully approve of Levist opportunism.</i> After this 
report, he read the now-famous <i>Memorial to the German Proletariat</i>, 
concerning the Max Hölz affair. This <i>Memorial</i> describes Max Hölz as a 
valiant rebel against capitalist society, whose actions, while corresponding to 
his love for the proletariat and his hatred for the bourgeoisie, are not 
appropriate. The CI opposes his use of terror. The KAPD protested against this <i>
Memorial</i>; it showed that this <i>Memorial</i> turns its back on the acts of 
Max Hölz and that in the KAPD&#8217;s eyes it was nothing but an insult. Radek bridled 
at this &#8220;disruption&#8221;, saying, among other things, that the KAPD had even gone so 
far as to fight in defense of the tomb of the fallen.</p>

<p class="fst">Then the debates on the Executive Committee&#8217;s report began. It 
was the KAPD&#8217;s delegation which fired the first shot. The KAPD, responding to 
Zinoviev who had attacked the party in his report, found it amusing that it 
should be included in the same bag with Dittmann and his ilk, and made the 
following declaration to conclude its interventions:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We protest, with the greatest firmness, against the attempts to 
put us into the same bag with the Dittmanns and the Serratis, by the use of a 
few quotations taken out of context. We do not forget, for even one moment, the 
difficulties encountered by soviet power due to the ebb of the world 
revolutionary wave, but we are at the same time aware of the danger that all of 
these difficulties may lead to a contradiction between the interests of the 
world revolutionary proletariat and the momentary interests of soviet Russia&#8212;a 
real or an apparent contradiction.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;At a session of this committee, it was declared that the Third 
International must not be considered as an instrument of soviet power, but that 
the latter was merely the strongest bastion of the Third International. We also 
think that is how it should be. But we think that when contradictions arise 
between the vital interests of soviet power and those of the Third 
International, it is our duty to openly and fraternally examine these 
contradictions within the Third International.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;As far as practical solidarity with soviet Russia is concerned, 
we have always done our duty, and this is obvious. For example, we have 
celebrated the October Revolution with demonstrations, we have generously 
participated in efforts to provide aid to imprisoned Red Army soldiers, and we 
prepared the solidarity actions of August 1920; the latter failed due to the 
lack of involvement on the part of the USPD and the Communist Party. 
Demonstrating our solidarity with soviet Russia was one of the decisive 
motivations for our party when it decided, despite our very serious reservations 
concerning its tactics, to join the Third International.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We shall continue to pursue such policies, but we shall, 
everywhere and at all times, oppose with the most steadfast resistance any 
instance where the policies of soviet Russia lead the Third International into 
reformist practice. We are convinced that such reformism is in contradiction of 
the true interests of soviet Russia itself, as well as those of the world 
proletariat.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The well-known attack on the KAPD took place on the second day of 
the debate on the Executive Committee&#8217;s report. Number 214 of our journal 
provides the complete text.</p>

<p class="fst">In response to the vote on the ultimatum<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> directed at the KAPD, 
we nonetheless presented the following motion:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;1. The 21 Conditions of the Second Congress are now even less 
capable than they were previously of providing any kind of security against 
reformist putrefaction in the future.</p>

<p class="quoteb">2. After the creation and admission of the large mass parties, 
the Third International needs, now more than ever, the presence of a purely 
proletarian revolutionary opposition.</p>

<p class="quoteb">3. Such an opposition cannot be effective unless it is not 
overwhelmed by the apparatus and the number of votes of a party that wants (as a 
matter of principle), at whatever cost, to unify the masses behind it and thus 
can only be and must be reformist.</p>

<p class="quoteb">4. The Unified Communist Party (VKPD), in particular, remains to 
this very day, in relation to its tactical principles, within the camp of Paul 
Levi. Its own left wing is usually the prisoner of a fatal self-deception.</p>

<p class="quoteb">5. In conclusion, currents related to the KAPD are now forming in 
every party in the Comintern. But they cannot continue to grow in the interest 
of the proletarian revolution and the International, unless the KAPD can 
continue to subsist as an independent party within the CI.</p>

<p class="quoteb">For all of the above reasons, we propose that the <i>KAPD should remain in the CI as a sympathizing organization.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Radek delivered the speech summarizing the question of <i>tactics</i>. 
We proposed a supplementary summary, but our entire delegation was granted only 
one hour to speak. We presented our point of view (rejection of trade union and 
parliamentary methods) and called for the application of the methods of struggle 
of the Communist Workers Party and the General Workers Union.</p>

<p class="fst">At one moment during the debate, the VKPD defended the offensive 
launched during the &#8220;March Action&#8221;. <i>Soon, however, the following typical 
incident took place: after Clara Zetkin had spoken and after everyone had their 
turn speaking, after Lenin and Trotsky said she was right and condemned Levi 
merely for a breach of discipline, the &#8220;leftist&#8221; whims of the VKPD&#8217;s delegation 
evaporated.</i> Radek reproached the <i>Rote Fahne</i><a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> for having too 
suddenly and precipitously begun the &#8220;March Action&#8221;. The VKPD&#8217;s Friedland 
admitted that this was true.</p>

<p class="fst">The theses on this question were sent back to the committee for 
re-elaboration.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> Before the conclusion of the Congress a vote was taken on the 
appropriate tactical orientation for the International. Confronted with this 
vote, we prepared the following declaration:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The theses presented for the vote of the Third Congress are the 
consistent and even intensified continuation of the basic line adopted by the 
Second Congress and of the policies which have been pursued until now by the EC. 
The theses grant an unlimited field of activity to the traitorous intelligentsia 
of the opportunists and reformists of every country for their work of 
mystification, especially when they are considered in the context of the world 
economic situation. Any clear dividing line separating them from the Hilferdings 
is erased; all organic relations to the reality of the modern class struggle are 
abandoned.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The supposed left wing of the Congress<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a>, pushed forward by the 
revolutionary workers who support it, began to make feeble attempts to correct 
these tactical theses. Their efforts were rebuffed in conformance with the 
wishes of the right wing, by the majority. Nor did we lend them any support. 
They did, of course, testify to their good faith desire to augment revolutionary 
activity, but they did not reckon with the concrete conditions of the struggle; 
they did not attack the bourgeois-parliamentary basis of the 21 Conditions, nor 
did they attack the general tendency implied by that basis; for this reason, 
their efforts were transformed into an obstacle to any further clarification.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The preparation for the victory of the proletarian revolution in 
the capitalist countries can only be carried out within the struggles 
themselves. These struggles are necessarily born from the fact of capital&#8217;s 
economic and political attacks. The communist party can neither unleash such 
struggles by itself, nor can it refuse to enter the fray, without sabotaging the 
preparations for victory. During the course of those struggles which do erupt, 
it cannot gain their leadership unless it opposes to all the illusions of the 
masses the complete clarity of the final goal and the methods of struggle. This 
is how it can become, by means of a dialectical process, the nucleus for the 
crystallization of the revolutionary fighters who, during the course of the 
struggle, gain the confidence of the masses.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;With this declaration, we set ourselves in opposition in every 
possible way to the adoption of the theses on tactics, and we refer to the 
theses we have presented on the role of the party in the proletarian 
revolution.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Lenin presented the report on the tactics of the Russian 
Communist Party.</i> He unveiled the Russian government&#8217;s new line on the policy 
of concessions, free trade, etc., and he defended it. Russia&#8217;s new policies are 
well-known and have been subjected to criticism on various occasions. A comrade 
from the KAPD made a statement against Lenin&#8217;s speech.</p>

<p class="fst">Then Radek gave his speech. <i>After him, comrade Kollontai, of 
the Russian Workers Opposition, spoke.</i> Her intervention was an event of the 
highest importance, which would have the most far-reaching consequences. Until 
then, no one had dared to publicly intervene in opposition to the current 
policies of the Bolsheviks and the soviet government. The comrade declared that 
she was obliged to <i>put revolutionary discipline above party discipline. She 
directed her attack particularly against the Bolshevik policy &#8220;which is 
preparing the return to capitalism&#8221;</i> and then she attacked the attitude of 
the soviet government &#8220;which rejects those workers who are ready to construct 
the soviet system.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky immediately took the floor and attempted, by means of 
very long explanations, to subject comrade Kollontai to ridicule. He could not, 
however, refute her arguments. The KAPD delegation then addressed this issue. We 
placed particular emphasis on the fact that, although we had never meddled in 
the domestic affairs of the Russian Party, now that we had become aware of 
comrade Kollontai&#8217;s arguments, we were obliged to adopt an even more critical 
position in respect to the soviet government.</p>

<p class="fst">At that moment, comrade Roland-Holst, from the Dutch minority 
faction, felt obliged to defend the RCP against our attacks, declaring that the 
RCP was of the left and always had been.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>On the trade union question, Zinoviev and Heckert</i> from the 
VKPD presented their report amidst the total indifference of the Congress 
assembly. Once again, our entire delegation was condemned to only one hour to 
present our views. At that moment, the Congress feigned an attack of deafness. 
Our theses on the trade union question were referred to the committee, where 
they were rejected as possible bases for discussion, with the allegation that 
&#8220;the Congress had, in its every position, rejected the conceptions of the KAPD&#8221;. 
We proposed, prior to the vote on the theses submitted by the central bureau of 
the EC, that we should once again explain our theses in a brief concluding 
intervention. This request was denied.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>The Youth question: Münzenberg&#8217;s report. Women&#8217;s rights. The 
Eastern question</i>: none of these presentations aroused the least interest in 
the Congress.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>After having vainly attempted, despite all the attacks and 
distortions to which we were subjected, despite all the maneuvers to reduce us 
to silence, to prevent the Third International from being utterly submerged in 
opportunism, we drew up a balance sheet of the Congress.</i> Faced with the 
ultimatum of the Congress demanding that the KAPD yield to the discipline of the 
International, we responded as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The KAPD delegation has submitted the results of the Congress to 
a new examination, both as regards the decision which it must announce in 
response to the motion of the Congress which demands, in the form of an 
ultimatum, the dissolution of the KAPD into the VKPD, as well as in respect to 
our relations with the Third International. Fully acknowledging the gravity of 
the responsibilities it assumes, the delegation unanimously draws the following 
conclusions:&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The tactical struggle against the KAPD throughout the Congress 
was from the beginning carried out like a fight against an adversary whose 
arguments must not be taken into consideration, insofar as its basis, and its 
very existence as a political factor, must be annihilated on the pretext of 
discipline.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;This is confirmed by the following facts:</p>

<p class="indentc">1. For several weeks, the Congress participants have been given a 
completely false image of the KAPD, through articles which misrepresent our 
party in the Russian press, in the <i>Communist International</i><a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> and in the 
Congress newspaper. Meanwhile, our in-depth reports and our rectifications have 
not been printed.</p>

<p class="indentc">2. The way the Congress was structured constantly obliged us to 
fragment the expression of our positions. That this tactic had been pre-arranged 
becomes especially clear due to the fact that we were not even granted the 
opportunity to prepare a report or even a supplementary report on an issue which 
directly concerns us, the issue of the KAPD. We were thus obliged to refuse to 
speak at all so as to not become accomplices in a farce.</p>

<p class="indentc">3. The basis for the ultimatum directed against us was an alleged 
EC resolution brought to the attention of the Congress participants despite the 
fact that the EC never addressed the matter in any of its sessions, and despite 
the fact that none of its sessions ever heard, and therefore had all the less 
opportunity to have arrived at, any decision on this problem.</p>

<p class="indentc">4. This question, which had for a whole week remained one of the 
last points on the Congress&#8217;s agenda, as an issue which was to be treated 
separately, was never even separately discussed with us in preparation for the 
EC report. (Point Number Two of the day&#8217;s agenda). It was arranged by &#8220;decree&#8221;. 
In this manner, the result which was expected in advance was achieved: the 
Congress&#8217;s judgment was settled in advance, before it could have dared to become 
aware of our positions during the course of a debate on questions of principle.</p>

<p class="indentb">This formal procedure is strictly connected to the political 
orientation along which the Third International has been evolving, under the 
determinant influence of the Russian comrades. The outcome of the Congress has 
proven this: the political line of Paul Levi has been victorious in the 
Congress; the formal recognition of the March Action has been revealed as the 
freedom of revolution.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Czechoslovakian party was admitted as a section with full 
rights, without any real guarantees at all and on the basis of empty promises. 
Out of fear, its opportunist leader Sméral was treated with great tact. As for 
the Italian Socialist Party, which has just signed a pact with the fascists, it 
was treated with the utmost indulgence amidst a welter of concern for details. 
The principle of participating in bourgeois parliaments was preserved, despite 
the sorrowful experiences of Germany, Austria, France, etc., and even though the 
caricatures of the supposed revolutionary parliamentarism were seen in action. 
Reaffirming the disastrous policy of working in the old trade unions has led 
those who have followed it, despite all their phraseology, towards Amsterdam; 
the capitalist ploy of economic parliamentarism was also preserved. The Congress 
has even supported, without a single word of demurral, the ridiculous idea of 
revolutionizing the consumer cooperatives.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;All of this is testimony to continued adherence to the path laid 
out by the Second Congress, and to the same detour: from revolution to 
reformism; from the sphere of struggle to the tactics of diplomacy, to intrigues 
and the illusory whitewashing of contradictions. All of these examples justify 
the protest (against the adoption of the theses on tactics) which we have 
published in the summary reports.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;These are the facts which must be taken into account (in 
considering the resolution demanding our dissolution into the VKPD) in order to 
conclude that the ultimatum is totally unacceptable to the KAPD. Such a 
reunification would mean our subordination to the discipline of a party in 
decomposition, in which reformism has snuck in the back door under the influence 
of the Congress. We would be muzzled by an organizational apparatus 
(press-finances-cliques-leaders) which is set up against us. Any faint hope of 
having a salutary influence within such a party lacks the least basis in 
reality. The delegation has dispensed with all such hopes on its own accord, 
even without a special order from the party:&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The delegation unanimously rejects the ultimatum to join the 
VKPD.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We do not declare the KAPD&#8217;s break with the Third International, 
although we do have the power to act in the name of our party. Our comrades will 
address this matter. They will provide their response to the attempt to force 
them to join with others on the road of reformism and opportunism. The 
international proletariat will await their response.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Our decision was made in the full awareness of its very serious 
nature. We are fully aware of our responsibility to the German workers, to 
soviet Russia, and to the world revolution. The revolution will not allow itself 
to be shackled by a Congress resolution. The revolution lives. It will continue 
on its path. We go with it; at its service, we follow our road.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">Signed,<i><br>
The KAPD Delegation</i></p>

<p class="fst">We decided to read this declaration at the end of the Congress, 
in order to make our opinion completely known to all the delegates. But this was 
not authorized by the Presidium; we were merely allowed to include our 
declaration in the published summary reports.</p>

<p class="fst">We understood why the Presidium did this:</p>

<p class="fst">The entire Congress was overcome by a condition of blind 
enthusiasm. The applause was endless, the cameras were flashing, and the movie 
cameras whirred. At that moment, our delegation constituted an accusation; it 
was a warning, like the warning given of old to Babylon.</p>

<p class="fst">But the directors of the Bolshoi Theater would not get away so 
easily. During the course of <i>the meeting of the Executive Committee</i> which 
took place on the following day and which was attended by the representatives of 
every country, our declaration was nevertheless read by our delegation and 
convincingly and loudly proclaimed to more than one representative of the 
revolutionary proletariat that a hangover would necessarily follow the binge of 
resolutions adopted amidst all the hoopla and indecent publicity stunts.</p>

<p class="fst">We must also mention that our delegation was only admitted to the 
final session of the Executive Committee for the sole purpose of reading our 
declaration and that we had to immediately evacuate the premises afterwards. It 
was in our absence that the Executive Committee debated the question of the KAPD 
and approved a resolution which was later communicated to our delegation. This 
resolution stated:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Despite the declaration of the KAPD which amounts to a 
declaration of war on the Communist International, the recently-elected 
Executive Committee has decided:</p>

<p class="quotec">1. To immediately publish a detailed open letter to the members 
of the KAPD and to demand that the KAPD arrive at a decision within the next two 
months.</p>

<p class="quotec">2. To send a delegation to the next congress of the KAPD.</p>

<p class="quotec">3. The delegation of the KAPD is, pursuant to the terms of the 
resolution of the Congress, authorized to provisionally participate in the 
Executive in a consultative role, but without a vote.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The members of the KAPD are capable of providing the response 
which this declaration of the Executive Committee deserves. We know how it was 
arrived at, we know the text. <i>The balance sheet of the Congress is this: the 
Levi tendency, in general, has won. The &#8220;March Action&#8221; has been renounced. The 
&#8220;theory of the revolutionary offensive&#8221; has been registered among the infantile 
disorders. The KAPD has been excluded from the Third International.</i></p>

<p class="fst">Comrades! We have done all we could. We acted as the members of 
the party had demanded. Without any compromise, and without any concessions to 
the tapestry of illusions known as the Third International, we have followed our 
own road at the Third World Congress.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>The KAPD faces gigantic tasks. In its thought, its decisions 
and its action, it will have to make its way rapidly and decisively so that the 
world proletarian revolution will be victorious!</i></p>

<p class="fst">Report presented at the session of the Central Committee of July 
31, 1921</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>Report of the Session of the Central Committee of the KAPD<br>
(July 31, 1921)</h3>

<p class="fst">On the third point of the agenda: the policy of the Russian State 
and the Third International.</p>

<p class="fst">From one era to another, history follows a logical course and not 
even Russia can avoid it. The economic relations in Russia can only thwart the 
Russian comrades in their ongoing attempt to skip the capitalist phase. The 
feudalism of the Russian agricultural economy must, first of all, be overcome, 
insofar as this agricultural economy, due to its immensity and the lack of 
developed industry and markets, stamps the economic and political character of 
the country with its basic features. Class contradictions exist between the 
Russian peasants, who aspire to a private capitalist economy, and the Russian 
proletariat, which is fighting for a communal proletarian economy. The Russian 
government has become the representative of the bourgeoisie and the peasantry 
through the alteration of its policies in favor of the economic interests of the 
peasants. Such policies are always the consequences of economic development. The 
soviet government thus finds itself, for some time now, in contradiction with 
part of the Russian proletariat. Today, discord has reached an extraordinary 
level: the formation of the workers opposition in Russia and the violent 
struggles against the soviet government are characteristic proofs of this. The 
KAPD&#8217;s position on the soviet government must be modified in accordance with 
these facts: in the future, the KAPD can no longer unconditionally support the 
decisions of the soviet government, since its decisions are directed in part 
against the revolutionary proletariat in Russia: the workers opposition. Support 
for the soviet government can only be justified to the degree that the latter 
fights against the common enemy of the Russian proletariat, the peasants, and 
the petit-bourgeoisie: the feudal nobility. Furthermore, the KAPD must 
definitively separate itself from the Third International, because the latter 
has become an element of Russian State policy and must consequently adapt to the 
transformation underway in the character of the Russian government. After the 
Third Congress, the Third International has openly shown itself to be an enemy 
of the proletarian world revolution, insofar as it has excluded the KAPD. But we 
cannot remain outside a proletarian communist international; the KAPD must, 
starting now, begin to lay the foundations of new, truly revolutionary communist 
workers international.</p>

<p class="fst">After debate, during the course of which some representatives 
expressed the idea that the soviet government&#8212;despite the radical reversal of 
its economic policy&#8212;might still be the representative of the Russian 
revolutionary proletariat, the Central Committee put forward its conceptions in 
the following declaration, which was adopted against the negative votes of 
Hanover and East Saxony, with Berlin abstaining:</p>

<p class="indentb">1. The Central Committee believes that the course of events at 
the Third World Congress has brought about, <i>in principle, a rupture within 
the Moscow International</i>.</p>

<p class="indentb">The Central Committee, taking into account <i>the need for international class struggle</i>, intends to construct a communist workers international for the accomplishment of the most urgent tasks of the world proletarian revolution.</p>

<p class="indentb">The Central Committee believes, furthermore, that the 
fundamentals, the tactics and the organizational form of this communist workers 
international must be adapted to the conditions of the proletarian revolution.</p>

<p class="indentb">2. The Central Committee declares that our policy towards the 
soviet government must at all times be dictated by that government&#8217;s positions. 
If the soviet government were to act as a factor in the struggle of the 
proletarian revolution, then the KAPD must support it with active solidarity. 
Should that government abandon our camp and assume the role of police chief for 
the bourgeois revolution, then the KAPD must fight it in a resolute manner.</p>

the socialist party and the socialist party&#8217;s center faction went over to the CP 
as well. In 1922, it had 170,000 members (cf. Carr, <i>The Bolshevik Revolution, 
1917-23</i>, Vol. 3, p. 447). Along with the PCF and the KPD, it is one of the 
rare &#8220;mass&#8221; communist parties in Europe during the twenties and thirties. In 
Norway, for example, the social democratic majority joined the CI and became the 
Communist Party, but most of these communists returned a few years later to the 
socialist party.</p>
