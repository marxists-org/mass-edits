<p class="fst">The March Action was the last proletarian insurrection of the 
German revolution. Neither the Hamburg insurrection, a military operation of the 
KPD, nor the resistance to the French Army in the Ruhr in 1923, which united all 
classes, could be considered as proletarian insurrections. The failure of the 
&#8220;March Action&#8221; marked the beginning of the decomposition of the communist left.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">The Crisis of 1921</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Between the defeat of the Red Army of the Ruhr and the March 
Action of 1921, proletarians launched a series of dispersed local actions, which 
were simultaneously defensive and offensive, comparable to those which had 
previously broken out in central Germany and Saxony, although on a different 
scale, but were unable to unite their forces.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> The March Action first 
developed in the region of Halle and Mansfeld, which had remained as the last 
revolutionary stronghold after the crushing of the Ruhr. The copper mines of 
Mansfeld and the ultramodern chemical works at Leuna formed the backbone of the 
Action. The workers there had kept the arms they had seized in 1918. Saxony, 
which had attracted new workers to its lignite and chemical industries, was 
still the stronghold of the USPD, despite the inroads made by the VKPD, which 
had its most solid district there: in reality, it merely carried on the 
tradition of the USPD. The VKPD had 60,000 members in Saxony; in the February 
1921 elections it won 200,000 votes, more than the SPD (80,000) and the rump 
USPD (75,000) combined. The 25,000 workers at Leuna were organized into military 
formations, and 2,000 of them belonged to the AAUD. It was undoubtedly one of 
the strongest districts of the KAPD-AAUD. The region had been subjected to the 
martial law of the Kapp Putsch in March 1920. Many weapons had remained hidden. 
A wave of theft spread in the factories. The workers demanded, above all, a 
reduction in working hours (in the Leuna works, for example) and the suppression 
of the private security forces in the factories, which were violently 
attacked.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> Sooner or later the government would have to intervene to pacify 
the region. If the pre-existing autonomous defensive movement of the proletariat 
was the starting point for the March offensive, one must not ignore, on the 
other hand, an essential factor in the context within which the Action took 
place: the VKPD&#8217;s change of orientation at the beginning of 1921, and the 
emergence of a leftist tendency in the Communist International.</p>

<p class="fst">The winter of 1920-1921 coincided with a social and political 
crisis in Russia as a result of the civil war. Important movements against 
Bolshevik power took place among the peasants (such as the Tambor revolt and the 
Makhnovist insurrection) and the remnants of the Russian proletariat (the civil 
war had almost annihilated industry and the workers who carried out the 1917 
revolution). The most well-known strike occurred in Petrograd, and was urgently 
repressed by the State at the same time that the Kronstadt rebellion broke out. 
At a political level, that is, within the party, this crisis was reflected in 
the appearance of the Workers Opposition.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> The crisis was overcome by the 
victory of the Leninists at the Tenth Congress and the defeat of the various 
rebel movements in March of 1921. Previously, throughout the whole period when 
the outcome of the crisis appeared uncertain, a tendency appeared within the 
International which was determined to &#8220;force&#8221; the course of events. It was this 
tendency which was represented by the Communist International&#8217;s delegation 
composed of B. Kun, Guralsky and Pogany, who were called <i>Turkestanis</i> by 
the KPD right wing. According to some (R. Fischer<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a>), they were acting under 
the orders of Zinoviev, General Secretary of the Communist International. 
According to others (Flechtheim), they were controlled primarily by Radek, 
leading agent of the Communist International responsible for tactics to be 
followed in Germany, who was in close contact with the KPD&#8217;s new leadership. It 
appears that Lenin had little knowledge of the mission confided to B. Kun.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The order for the &#8220;palace revolution&#8221; which was transmitted by 
the VKPD leadership to the leftists was inspired by the Communist 
International&#8217;s delegation, which had arrived in Berlin at the end of February. 
Levi, after having violently criticized the conceptions and methods of the <i>
Turkestanis</i>, was excluded from the central committee. The virulent KAPD 
constituted a pole of repulsion or attraction (depending on the circumstances) 
for the VKPD. It was the latter pole which prevailed in March. The environment 
in the party was quite animated; an action had to be launched for the immediate 
seizure of power. When the first disturbances began, the VKPD immediately 
distributed a document inviting the proletarians to violently overthrow the 
government: the disturbances in central Germany were to be the point of 
departure for an insurrection throughout the <i>Reich</i>. This tactic was 
implemented <i>before</i> the government&#8217;s decision to occupy the Mansfeld 
region with police forces became known. Once the battles had begun, the central 
committee more or less openly issued a call for armed insurrection in the <i>
Rote Fahne</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD demonstrated its jubilation: &#8220;It is the proletariat 
itself which has spoken. The masses of the VKPD have taken action by following 
our watchword. They have compelled their leaders to do the same.&#8221; (<i>Communist 
Workers Daily</i>, organ of the Berlin district of the KAPD). A proclamation of 
the VKPD from March 18 declared: &#8220;All workers, ignore the law, and take up arms 
wherever they can be found.&#8221; With such slogans, the two parties worked together 
provisionally. The only current on the left which was reluctant to join in this 
opportunity to encourage an insurrectionary action was that of the AAUD sections 
which had broken with the KAPD (the Rühle tendency).</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">Max Hölz</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The police units arriving from Berlin intervened in the Mansfeld 
region on the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>. During that night the workers decided upon a 
general strike, scheduled for the 21<sup style="font-size: 80%">st</sup>. On the 20<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, 
meanwhile, an attack was carried out against the &#8220;Column of Victory&#8221; in Berlin 
by VKPD combat groups, with the indirect participation of Max Hölz.</p>

<p class="fst">Hölz, from a working class background and himself a worker, &#8220;had 
nothing to do with politics&#8221; before the revolution. Upon his return from the 
front after the war, where he had served as a volunteer, he found himself 
unemployed and, in his home town in Saxony, joined the movement. He first joined 
the USPD, and then, in 1919, he entered the KPD and became famous by organizing 
armed gangs which were very effective against the police, the Army and the <i>
Freikorps</i>. The following is a description of one of Hölz&#8217;s units from an 
account written by a member of the KAPD:<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> a motorized squad had between 60 
and 200 men. A reconnaissance unit proceeded in advance, armed with machine guns 
or small arms; and then came the trucks with the heavy weaponry. Then came the 
commander in his own car &#8220;with the strongbox&#8221;, along with his &#8220;secretary of the 
treasury&#8221;. As a rearguard, another truck loaded with heavy guns followed behind. 
All of these vehicles were covered with red flags. Upon arriving in a town, 
supplies were requisitioned and post offices and banks looted. The general 
strike was proclaimed and largely paid for by the business owners. Butchers and 
bakers were compelled to sell their goods for 30% or 60% less than the normal 
prices. Any resistance was immediately and violently crushed. Such units were 
very active throughout Saxony after the Kapp Putsch; their activities led to a 
conflict between Hölz and the regional KPD leader, Brandler, who expelled Hölz 
from the party&#8217;s Chemnitz section. Hölz then joined the KAPD, and began to send 
a portion of the money from his expropriations to the KAPD leadership. Without 
conceding too much importance to the KAPD&#8217;s theories, he found it to be a 
flexible construct. While jealously guarding the independence of the armed 
groups under his leadership, he did not hesitate to collaborate with the KPD or 
with any other groups whenever he thought it would be useful.</p>

<p class="fst">He was very popular as a result of his tactic of retribution 
which consisted of &#8220;taking from the rich to give to the poor&#8221;. Quite often, 
workers who were in a weak position in their factory would attend one of his 
meetings. Hölz would then compel the business owners to pay a certain sum or 
face reprisals. Besides extortion and blackmail, his repertoire included freeing 
prisoners, the destruction of legal documents and archives, burning the mansions 
of the rich, etc. He was equally popular for constantly evading the police. In 
April 1919, a reward of 30,000 marks was offered for his capture. He would not 
be apprehended until after the March Action.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The <i>Communist Workers Daily</i> of the KAPD expressed its 
unequivocal approval of the attack on the Column of Victory. On the 22<sup style="font-size: 80%">nd</sup> 
and 23<sup style="font-size: 80%">rd</sup>, identical attacks were carried out, supervised and 
organized by, and under the direct control of Hölz and the combat groups of the 
KPD and the KAPD, in Falkenstein, Dresden, Freiburg, Leipzig, Plauen, etc., 
against courthouses and police stations. These organizations then resumed their 
usual activities. But in all of these cities, the workers did not stir. The only 
regions where &#8220;solidarity&#8221; was demonstrated were the Ruhr, Berlin and Hamburg. 
Leaving Berlin, where he had lived in hiding since the spring of 1920, Hölz 
arrived in Saxony. Together with the radicalization of the strikes, the 
intervention of armed groups like those led by Hölz constituted the originality 
of this March Action which owed little to the initiative or the control of the 
two communist parties. The emissaries of both parties proved incapable of 
influencing the course of events.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">Chronology of Events.<br>
Opposition Develops between the Local Organizations 
and the Leaderships of the KPD and the KAPD</a></h3>

<p class="fst">When the strike was called in the Mansfeld region, the public 
service employees of Halle spontaneously went on strike in solidarity. In the 
Leuna works, on the 21<sup style="font-size: 80%">st</sup>, the workers deposed the old workers council 
and named an action committee composed of two members of the KPD and two members 
of the KAPD, presided over by the KAPD&#8217;s Utzelmann. They demanded the withdrawal 
of the police and declared they would go on strike if the <i>Schupos</i> (<i>Reich</i> 
security police) came anywhere near their factory, which they did on the 23<sup style="font-size: 80%">rd</sup>. 
The vast majority of the workers of Leuna, despite its reputation as a 
stronghold of the left, did not want to go beyond the strike, assessing that the 
situation in that region was not favorable for an insurrection. This point of 
view was shared by the KAPD members in the Leuna factory who, isolated from 
their Berlin central committee, were unaware that the latter had supported the 
KPD&#8217;s insurrectionary directives. Utzelmann would later declare that he could 
not understand why the KAPD <i>Zentrale</i> had not taken into account the fact 
that the VKPD had acted in conformity with Russian interests.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> The Leuna 
workers condemned Hölz&#8217;s shenanigans and turned their backs on him when the 
battle came to an end. Nonetheless, it seems that during the strike they had 
devoted their time to the construction of an armored train.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> The Leuna works 
&#8220;had declared its opposition to the armed struggle, correctly considering it to 
be premature, but had participated anyway, just like the Berlin Spartacists in 
January 1919&#8221;<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a>. The police occupied the factory on the 29<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, killing 
34 workers and taking 1,500 prisoners. Politically, the strike in the factory 
was dominated by disputes between the two communist parties.</p>

<p class="fst">The reaction of the workers was initially timid, and the strikes 
would only develop later, after March 22<sup style="font-size: 80%">nd</sup>. The workers fighting 
against those who did not heed the strike call armed themselves and attacked the 
police.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> Hölz summoned the workers to arm themselves in various cities. The 
first skirmishes took place in Eisleben on the 23<sup style="font-size: 80%">rd</sup>: the police 
intervened and proceeded to make some arrests. Hölz established his command post 
in this region, known for its copper mines. His assault detachments were 
composed of 2,500 workers. Nor was he the only one to act in this fashion. The 
region had a great number of battle units with notorious or anonymous leaders. 
Plättner, for example, played at least as important a role as Hölz in the March 
battles, without trying to garner any publicity for his own account.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> These 
people were the only real participants in the insurrection. The KPD and the KAPD 
only issued the directives, without having any real influence on the course of 
events once the fighting had started.</p>

<p class="fst">Eberlein, in charge of the KPD combat groups, also arrived in 
Halle on the 22<sup style="font-size: 80%">nd</sup>. He tried to convince the commando groups of the 
region to carry out dynamite attacks, fake kidnappings of well-known communist 
leaders and other measures of the same kind to &#8220;increase the level of 
combativity among the masses&#8221;<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a>. Garnering no support at all, he experienced 
complete failure: the same thing happened to B. Kun, who accompanied him, as 
well as to Rasch and Jung, who were sent by the KAPD central committee to the 
scene of the events.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The leadership was in the hands of proletarian rebels who had 
lived for a long time under conditions of illegality and who, although not 
obeying the directives of the party&#8217;s Berlin central committee, are either 
members of the KPD or sympathize with it.&#8221;<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Hölz&#8217;s army dominated the region for ten days, but only fought 
particular aspects of capital without changing anything essential. It was 
primarily an armed gang<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> which executed certain operations. The proletarians 
constituted themselves as a military force but would not change anything. Their 
violence remained without an objective, and destroyed the visible enemy, but not 
the enemy&#8217;s roots. It was a <i>negative</i> movement. Occupied by close to 2,000 
workers, the industrial complex of Leuna was not directly utilized for 
revolutionary ends. One part of the proletarians remained outside of the 
workplace and fought without the <i>social</i> weapon which, for the 
proletariat, is production. The other part shut itself up within the factory. 
There was neither any coordination between these two groups, nor was there any 
concentrated employment of military force against the State. The movement ran 
out of steam due to both its purely <i>military</i> generalized offensive, and 
because it had ensconced itself <i>at the point of production</i>. Hölz robbed 
money, but he did not abolish it.</p>

<p class="fst">The rest of Germany remained calm. In Hamburg, on the 23<sup style="font-size: 80%">rd</sup>, 
a large rally of unemployed workers and a demonstration headed for the port 
ended in a confrontation between strikers and non-strikers. Organized by the 
AAU, the workers faced off with the police in the city: several were killed. It 
was the only city where proletarians attempted an uprising. After the 24<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, 
martial law was imposed in Saxony. On the same date, the KPD central committee 
(together with the KAPD) called for an unlimited general strike throughout 
Germany (only two days before Easter Sunday). According to the KPD there were 
one million workers on strike (Hamburg, the Ruhr, Berlin and central Germany). 
The number of strikers was actually somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000, with 
insurrectionary tendencies in Berlin and the Ruhr. Approximately 120,000 workers 
heeded the strike call in central Germany. In general, the strikers were 
primarily workers who were organized in <i>unionen</i> affiliated with the FAUD 
and the AAUD.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The little coordination which existed during the March Action 
was the work of the <i>Unionen</i> (Hamburg and the Ruhr) and of the AAUD and 
KAPD in the Leuna works, their stronghold, as well as of M. Hölz&#8217;s group.&#8221;<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Hölz wanted to link up with the Leuna works, but this proved to 
be impossible. On the 27<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, he distributed 50 marks to each member of 
his armed commandos. They went towards Halle, but his troops were surrounded and 
forced to disperse. He took part in his last battle on April 1. Leuna had 
already fallen. On the 31<sup style="font-size: 80%">st</sup>, the KPD central committee cancelled its 
general directives. The last battles took place on the 1<sup style="font-size: 80%">st</sup> of April.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">The &#8220;Lessons of the March Action&#8221;</a></h3>

<h4><a name="h5">1. The VKPD</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Over the course of the next two months, the VKPD, always under 
the influence of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, 
executed another about-face and slowly abandoned the &#8220;offensive&#8221; in favor of 
legal activity. The Third Congress of the Communist International (July 1921) 
took place during the period of this about-face, at a moment when its main 
self-criticism was largely directed against the lack of technical &#8220;preparation&#8221;, 
and not against the insurrectionary directive itself. Shortly afterwards, the 
Action was characterized as a putsch, that is, Levi&#8217;s critique was resurrected, 
after Levi, of course, had been excluded. The reason for his expulsion was that 
he had made his opposition public and had insulted B. Kun&#8217;s delegation. But 
Lenin declared that Levi was <i>basically</i> correct.<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The KPD&#8217;s membership fell to 180,000 and later rose again to over 
200,000 in 1922. Radek was ordered to be more attentive to the affairs of the 
KPD. The KPD elected a new leadership and confined itself to the legal terrain, 
to agreements between parties and the formation of coalition governments. As 
1923 approached, the Eighth Congress declared its support for &#8220;workers 
governments&#8221;, that is, coalitions of the KPD and the SPD at the regional level. 
But a new leftist tendency was born at this Congress, led by A. Maslow and R. 
Fischer, representing the Frankfurt, Hamburg, Berlin and Ruhr districts. It 
wanted to create new red trade unions and to boycott the official trade unions 
and was opposed to the creation of &#8220;workers governments&#8221;. During this period, 
the Left, as typified by the KAPD, AAUD and AAUD-E, had almost ceased to exist 
(cf. Appendix I).</p>

<p class="fst">The leftist and rightist tendencies went to plead their cases to 
Moscow, where the rightist theses from the beginning of 1923 were condemned and 
an intensification of the struggle for power was advocated. The KPD, together 
with the SPD, formed &#8220;revolutionary hundreds&#8221; and established a central military 
committee in June of 1923. In October, workers governments were formed in Saxony 
and Thuringia: this implied that the SPD and KPD together had the parliamentary 
majority in these two states. By the end of the month, these &#8220;governments&#8221; would 
be overthrown by the <i>Reich</i> and its Army. That same year, the occupation 
of the Ruhr by the French army would allow Radek and the KPD to turn to national 
bolshevism, which had been so mercilessly denounced when it was supported by 
left communists. The KPD would even hold meetings with the Nazis. During one of 
these meetings, a Nazi orator rendered homage to the communists, but ironically 
advised them to rid themselves of the Jews who surrounded them, and especially 
of ... Radek.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> The KPD soon renounced these joint meetings. But, years later, 
it would broadcast the slogan of the &#8220;peoples&#8217; revolution&#8221; (<i>Volksrevolution</i>) 
and would once again collaborate with the NSDAP. In 1923, the &#8220;Group of German 
Communist Army Officers&#8221;, linked to the KPD, claimed to support O. Spengler, 
author of <i>The Decline of the West</i>, who advocated a sort of nationalistic 
socialism. This group even defined the council system as &#8220;a Prussian notion 
based on concepts of an elite, solidarity and mutual responsibility&#8221;.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> In the 
following year, R. Fischer would briefly assume the leadership of the KPD, with 
the support of the Communist International, largely as a result of her support 
for Zinoviev-Stalin against Trotsky: during this same period, Gramsci was 
supported by the Communist International against Bordiga, because he, too, took 
Stalin&#8217;s side.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> The factional struggles within the KPD during the period 
preceding the crisis of 1929 were more than just the expression of 
micro-bureaucratic confrontations. They were the translation onto the political 
plane (that is, the plane of power) of the vain attempt of the German 
proletarians to react after their defeat. All their efforts during this phase of 
regression only strengthened one bureaucratic group to the detriment of the 
others.</p>

<p class="fst">The history of the German Communist Party would be a continuous 
oscillation between the ultra-right and the ultra-left, characterized by 
successive waves of exclusions, and influenced by the vicissitudes of the 
policies of the Russian government. The debates and decrees of the Communist 
International, after the 1921 March Action, certainly offer the most 
overwhelming illustration of its incoherence, which even approached absurdity. 
Levi was excluded for violating party discipline, although the Communist 
International would subsequently basically agree with his position. Zetkin, who 
agreed with Levi, was not excluded, but, to the contrary, was granted 
(provisionally, until the arrival of R. Fischer) leadership of the party. The 
defeat of the March Action helped to condemn the KAPD, judged to be a dangerous 
proponent of the offensive at any cost, while the KPD had acted with at least as 
much adventurism (fake kidnappings and other &#8220;tricks&#8221; to prod the masses to 
rebellion). These flagrant contradictions are explained, in equal proportions, 
by the will of the Communist International, which was focused on &#8220;filling up&#8221; 
its organization in Germany (the VKPD), and by the party&#8217;s own incompetence. 
This mess aptly marks the irreparable end of an epoch.</p>

<p class="fst">The continuation of &#8220;Levism&#8221; without Levi also led to the fall of 
the VKPD&#8217;s first left-wing faction: the former <i>Bremerlinke</i> lost all of 
its influence in the leadership. It would not reappear until the end of the 
1920s as an opposition, which would then be called &#8220;rightist&#8221;: it would support 
Bukharin and Brandler-Thalheimer, advocates of the &#8220;Leninist united front&#8221; 
against the supposedly fashionable leftism of the Stalinist &#8220;class against 
class&#8221; tactic. Frölich would be excluded in 1928 as a &#8220;rightist&#8221;. &#8220;The <i>
Bremerlinke</i> appeared as the first and disappeared as the last expression of 
Leninism in Germany.&#8221;<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> The Bremen radicals &#8220;never stopped fleeing&#8221; from their 
connections with the German Left, thereby depriving themselves of the 
possibility of enriching their &#8220;Leninism&#8221; with the proletarian experience with 
which the other radical groups formed between 1914 and 1919 were more familiar. 
They bravely fought to create a Leninism for German use, but ended up isolating 
themselves from the proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">To make 1923 the pivotal date for both Russia and the Communist 
International is equivalent to privileging the history of &#8220;political events&#8221; to 
the detriment of the social movement and the ruptures which separate historical 
phases.<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The same holds true for starting with the evolution of the 
tendencies in the Russian Communist Party in order to write the history of 
Russia (cf. the Trotsky-Stalin conflict). In regard to Germany this would 
correspond to writing the history of the communist movement based on the 
evolution of the KPD: 1923 marking the great putschist shock; the rupture would 
be situated in 1923.</p>

<h4><a name="h6">2. The KAPD and Rühle&#8217;s AAUD-E</a></h4>

<p class="fst">Gorter and other leaders of the KAPD published <i>The Path of Dr. 
Levi, the Path of the VKPD</i>, whose putschism they denounced:<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> they blamed 
the failure of March on the tactics followed by the rightist KPD leadership 
since 1919. Reversing its policy in such a brutal fashion, going suddenly from 
the legal struggle to the revolutionary struggle, the VKPD had assumed a 
putschist attitude. But the March Action, as a real movement of the proletariat 
in central Germany, was not merely a putsch: it was even &#8220;the first conscious 
offensive action of the German proletarians&#8221;.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a> The KAPD would unconditionally 
defend the March Action at the Third World Congress.</p>

<p class="fst">The pamphlet briefly mentioned &#8220;the pressure exercised by certain 
authoritarian influences&#8221; on the VKPD prior to March, but it was Rühle&#8217;s 
tendency which more fully developed this theme. As Rühle wrote: &#8220;The workers 
must know that the Action in central Germany was an act of madness and a crime, 
for which the VKPD is entirely responsible.&#8221; The VKPD had acted without taking 
account of the situation, which was by no means favorable for an uprising. But 
this was not just a case of the VKPD behaving in an absurd manner: it was a case 
of &#8220;the totally subordinate execution of a misunderstood order which &#8216;came from 
above&#8217;&#8221;. &#8220;The Bolshevik power has used the German revolution until its internal 
situation was totally stabilized.&#8221;<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> At that moment, that is, after the 18<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup>, 
when Kronstadt had been recaptured, it was too late to call off the Action.</p>

<p class="fst">As for Hölz, captured a few days after the end of the fighting, 
he was condemned to life in prison. At first, his defense was organized by the 
communist left and then, once the latter had disappeared, it passed into the 
hands of &#8220;leftist personalities&#8221; on a committee created by the KPD, which made 
Hölz into a legendary figure. Hölz himself contributed to his own cult. The post 
offices in the city where he was imprisoned were inundated with packages and 
letters addressed to him from all over Germany. He was ultimately released. The 
KPD displayed him for a while as a leading personality, but later, when he 
became too troublesome, the party sent him to Moscow, where he died during the 
1930s, undoubtedly eliminated by the GPU. The <i>Workers Communist Newspaper</i> 
of the KAPD celebrated his achievements in the following passage: &#8220;Max Hölz has 
shown us how to annihilate the bourgeoisie. Max Hölz was our example! Our 
symbol! Our leader!&#8221; Thus has Max Hölz, and above all his cult, become a rather 
typical product of the immaturity of the proletariat.</p>
