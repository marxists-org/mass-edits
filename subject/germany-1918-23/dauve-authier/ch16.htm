<h3><a name="h1">German-Soviet Relations: 1918-1922</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The &#8220;<i>cordon sanitaire</i>&#8221; was an attempt to isolate Russia 
and close off Germany with the help of the countries which had recently been 
granted their independence in the name of the right of national 
self-determination: Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Baltic 
nations, and Finland. The Baltic nations, which had been part of Russia until 
1914, were occupied by the Germans in 1918. They then fought against the 
occupiers and against the revolution, driving out the large landowners of German 
(Estonia and Latvia) and Polish (Lithuania) origin. But these were not real 
&#8220;bourgeois revolutions&#8221;. None of these countries could be a viable national 
state in the classical sense of the term.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> In all of these States, Capital was 
too weak to assure cohesion: all of them incorporated, for good or for ill, 
considerable minorities, who were inevitably the victims of discrimination. The 
native population comprised no more than 73% of the population of Latvia, 80% in 
Lithuania, 69% in Poland, and 76% in Romania. In two countries it comprised less 
than half the total population: 46% in Czechoslovakia (Czechs) and in Yugoslavia 
(Serbs). Ethnic hostilities would bury the class struggle a little deeper under 
regional, ethnic and national ideas. From their origins these &#8220;nation states&#8221; 
were not really nation states at all, but creations of Anglo-American 
imperialism. In his critique of the Dutch Communist Party, Gorter emphasized 
this carving up of Europe which would render it impotent and favor America, as 
well as the counterrevolutionary impact of the movements for national liberation 
in Austria-Hungary and Russia. Although &#8220;Leninist&#8221; on the right of 
self-determination, Bordiga would also define the two world wars as American 
aggression against Europe.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> The German Left would be one of the first currents 
to recognize the return of Russia as a reactionary buttress alongside the USA, 
which together would assume the role played by England in the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> 
century.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Shortly after his release from prison at the end of 1919, Radek 
defined &#8220;the problem of Russia&#8217;s foreign policy&#8221; as follows: &#8220;reaching a <i>
modus vivendi</i> with the capitalist states.&#8221;<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> The influence of state foreign 
policy on Bolshevism did not yet have the character it would later assume after 
1921; its ambiguity still allowed for revolutionary positions. But its impact 
was all the greater insofar as the left did not immediately take it into 
account. Russia, instead of uniting with the revolutionary West, would respond 
by promoting the worst tactics of the western tradition:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Western culture has been fused with eastern culture to form a 
new, infinitely richer cultural content.&#8221;<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Broken on November 4, 1918, due to the expulsion of the Russian 
ambassador from Berlin, economic relations between Russia and Germany were 
resumed at the end of 1919.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> Throughout this period, Radek and other 
high-level soviet officials (Krasin, Minister of Foreign Trade; Kopp, Trade 
Attaché) held frequent meetings in Berlin and made some useful connections 
there. Radek undertook all of this work from his jail cell, while simultaneously 
busy Leninizing the Communist Party. Surprisingly, during this same period, the 
Communist International, far from having learned any lessons from what had 
happened in Germany, preferred to issue grandiloquent proclamations and to 
celebrate its martyrs.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> The Spartacist legend was soon born, whose martyrology 
would be used until about 1930.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">On May 6 a trade agreement was signed: this was two months after 
at least a fraction of the Communist International and perhaps of the Russian 
Communist Party had tried to steer events in Germany towards an insurrection. At 
the same time, Russia officially requested German military advisers.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> In April 
1922, the Rapallo Treaty marked the resumption of diplomatic relations between 
the two countries, which initiated economic negotiations and agreed to consult 
one another whenever international economic issues arose for either country. The 
treaty was the source of fruitful exchanges for Germany, although it did not 
exploit all the possibilities the treaty offered: it fulfilled precisely the 
role of &#8220;safety valve&#8221;, as the KAPD delegates to the Third World Congress 
described it.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Even though they knew very little about the contacts between the 
two countries, the KAPD nonetheless saw the crux of the matter: its declarations 
at the Third World Congress would prove to be totally justified. Krasin, for 
example, leader of a Russian trade mission which had arrived in England for 
negotiations in May-June 1920, declared that Russia was ready to renounce all 
propaganda and to cease meddling in British domestic affairs, if the English 
would reciprocate and reestablish economic relations with Russia.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">Collaboration between the German Left and the Bolsheviks</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Within the early KPD, prior to the exclusion of the Left, the two 
tendencies also clashed over the issue of the International: this was a 
continuation of the disagreement between the Left and the Center (and within the 
Center, with Spartacus) at Zimmerwald. The former were in favor of the immediate 
creation of an International based on the existing leftist groups, despite their 
weakness. The centrists and Spartacists thought that in order to set up an 
International, they would have to wait until conditions matured, judging that 
they were not yet mature enough; during the war the Spartacists had not yet 
abandoned the hope that the radicals might be able to reconquer the old 
International. This was why Eberlein spoke at the First Congress against the 
immediate founding of the International (cf. Chapter 11).</p>

<p class="fst">The First Congress called for the seizure of power, to which all 
means of struggle were to be subordinated. &#8220;Revolutionary parliamentarism&#8221; was 
only mentioned as one means among others. As mentioned above, precise positions 
were not established in regard to the trade union question and the party&#8217;s 
organizational structure. This gave the Left the impression that it was worthy 
of the Communist International&#8217;s recommendation. It seemed normal to Gorter in 
1919 that he should refer to the authority of the Communist International (and 
even to that of the KPD) in his text against the majority faction of the Dutch 
Communist Party. Indeed, since Gorter, Pannekoek, Roland-Holst and the ISD had 
collaborated with the Bolsheviks during the war (while the Spartacists had 
adopted a more subdued position), the founding Congress of the KAPD unanimously 
approved a resolution which stated that &#8220;the KAPD is unequivocally in the camp 
of the Third International&#8221; (April 1920). The KAPD would never again make such a 
sweeping declaration. Finally, the Left&#8217;s great theoretical text, <i>World 
Revolution and Communist Tactics</i>, written by Pannekoek at the end of 1919 
(but not its postscript) as well as the texts and even the poems of Gorter, 
contain apologies for Bolshevik power.</p>

<p class="fst">But the Left brought upon itself a certain number of reprimands, 
which arose when the Russians (and above all, Lenin and Radek) judged that the 
revolutionary wave had receded. In prison, Radek established the basic framework 
for the future relations between the German and Russian <i>States</i> while 
simultaneously intervening on the side of the Levist faction at Heidelberg. 
Lenin, in his <i>Salute to the Italian, French and German Communists</i><a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> 
(October 1919), spoke of a &#8220;sickness of growth&#8221; in communism, as evidenced by 
the rejection of legal opportunities, the refusal to &#8220;participate in bourgeois 
parliament, in the reactionary trade unions or in the Scheidemann-style works 
councils&#8221;. This letter was reprinted in the Hamburg <i>Communist Workers Daily</i>, 
which did not see, or feigned not to see, that Lenin was supporting Levi. But 
Lenin defined the &#8220;disagreements among communists&#8221; as &#8220;disagreements which share 
the common basis of one essential communist foundation, solid as a rock: this 
foundation is that of the recognition of the proletarian revolution, of the 
struggle against bourgeois democratic illusions and the bourgeois democratic 
parliament, the recognition of the dictatorship of the proletariat and of the 
power of the soviets. Upon such a foundation, disagreements are nothing to 
fear.&#8221; Lenin compared such disagreements to the disputes which arose among the 
Bolsheviks in 1906 and 1910-1912. This sickness &#8220;will pass as the movement 
grows, and it will grow marvelously&#8221;.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> On October 28, 1919, Lenin wrote to 
the KPD central committee: &#8220;since you all agree on <i>what is essential</i>... I 
see unity as possible and necessary, just as the break with the Kautskyists is 
necessary.&#8221; On the same date he wrote to the &#8220;comrade workers&#8221; of the KPD 
opposition: &#8220;The disagreements concerning secondary questions, as I understand 
them, can disappear and will inevitably disappear.&#8221;<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> One year later, he would 
say that it had been necessary to tolerate the Left for a while in order to 
absorb its best elements: now, we will not give them any publicity, we shall not 
speak of them any more.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">At the beginning of 1920, the Amsterdam Bureau was dissolved by 
means of a simple telephone call from Moscow (cf. Chapter 11).<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> Other 
warnings followed, culminating in the publication of <i>Infantile Disorder</i>, 
written in April 1920, published in a Russian edition in June and in German 
translation in July. The constant references in that pamphlet to the Russian 
experience (set out at the beginning of the work) were deceitful. The European 
communists were supposed to be inspired by the Russians when the latter found it 
useful, but they should not imitate the Russians when the latter did not want 
them to do so. Specific conditions in England were invoked to encourage the 
English Communist Party&#8217;s affiliation with the English <i>Labour Party</i>, 
which amounted to demanding that a party which was a member of the Third 
International must affiliate with the Second International. But he later invoked 
Bolshevik &#8220;discipline&#8221; to shame his opponents. Lenin attacked the Left&#8217;s two 
weakest points, without ever trying to understand the social movement that its 
texts were trying to express: the oppositions, Party/Class and Masses/Leaders, 
for example. Lenin dismantled these constructions in an almost clinical manner, 
ignoring what these oppositions (badly and partially) expressed. He had 
undertaken a <i>textual</i> critique, an analysis of phrases meticulously 
selected from the declarations of the Left. Lenin feared that the break with the 
Left (in which he included both the Italian as well as the German Left) &#8220;would 
become an international phenomenon... At all events, a split is better than 
confusion ... Let the Lefts put themselves to a practical test...&#8221;<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> In 
reality, Reichenbach&#8217;s testimony, a KAPD delegate to the Executive Committee of 
the Communist International,<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> and especially all of Lenin&#8217;s works and his 
practice throughout this era, show that Lenin conceded very little of his time 
to international questions compared to Russian domestic policy, which absorbed 
all the Bolsheviks&#8217; energies. The Russians had a superficial knowledge of the 
western movement. Above all, they wanted to build a <i>large</i> movement in 
Europe.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">Rühle and the Conflict within the KAPD</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The KAPD mistrusted the organizational and tactical 
centralization of the revolutionary movement, fearing that, in the conditions of 
that time, the inevitable domination of the Russians would cause the 
requirements of the struggle in the West to be forgotten. The preference for 
autonomy (referred to as anarchistic), although real in some (Rühle), played a 
lesser role at that time than the preoccupation with preserving the specificity 
of the struggles in the highly developed countries. It is in this sense that one 
must understand the KAPD&#8217;s assertion: &#8220;The tactic of the Communist International 
is nothing but the synthesis of the tactics of the different parties, each of 
which acts in its own country; there is not, nor can there be, a specific tactic 
of the International.&#8221;<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD Congress sent a delegation composed of Jan Appel and 
Franz Jung to Moscow in order to get a clear idea of the position of the 
Executive Committee and to present the theses of the KAPD. It was a hectic 
journey, given the situation of illegality in which most KAPD members lived, and 
because of the absence of diplomatic relations between Russia and Germany: Jung 
and Appel had to board ship in secret and, once at sea, hijacked the ship to 
Murmansk. When they arrived in Moscow in early May, Lenin was just then proofing 
the manuscript of <i>Infantile Disorder</i> and he read them a few passages.</p>

<p class="fst">When the Second World Congress was announced for July, the KAPD, 
without any news from the first delegation, sent Rühle to Moscow at the end of 
May. His journey was also difficult. The Executive Committee of the Communist 
International issued an &#8220;open letter&#8221; (June 2) to the members of the KAPD in 
which all ambiguity was dispelled: the Executive Committee was totally on the 
side of the KPD. Once again, the communists faced a familiar problem: the KAPD 
had no knowledge of this letter until the Second Congress had already begun. 
After a journey of several weeks, Rühle arrived in Moscow and became convinced 
that the &#8220;western&#8221; revolutionary movement had nothing in common with the 
&#8220;ultra-centralist&#8221; system which reigned in Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">After a brief discussion of his arrival in Russia, Rühle&#8217;s <i>
Report from Moscow</i><a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> criticized the position of the Jung-Appel delegation: 
&#8220;They did not have what it takes to confront the diplomacy and superior 
political savvy of the Moscow Executive. On questions of importance to the 
Party, they have succumbed to the influence to which they were subjected, and <i>
have made concessions</i> for which I can in no way be held responsible&#8212;this was 
obvious to me at first sight. On some points they have frankly abandoned the 
point of view which the KAPD considered essential to defend. More serious still: 
they have <i>promised in writing</i> to intervene in favor of the exclusion of 
comrades Laufenberg, Wolffheim and Rühle...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Rühle later described his first interview with Radek, which was 
occasionally &#8220;very violent&#8221;. &#8220;Every one of Radek&#8217;s phrases was a phrase from the <i>
Rote Fahne</i>. Each argument, an argument of Spartacus. Radek is, properly 
speaking, the grand master of the KPD. Dr. Levi and Heckert are his tame 
parrots. They have no opinions of their own and they are paid by Moscow.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I tried to get Radek to give me the open letter addressed to the 
KAPD. He promised he would give it to me, but he did not abide by his word. I 
reminded him about this again, several times, but he did not give me the letter. 
When I found out later that our two comrades who had led the negotiations had 
not known about the open letter until the last moment before their departure, 
Radek&#8217;s behavior became clear to me from a psychological point of view. He, the 
worst of tricksters, the most unscrupulous, at least felt a twinge of shame at 
the prospect of revealing the perfidious lies and shameless insults which filled 
the open letter, although he was afraid to have a face-to-face conversation with 
one of the injured and calumniated parties.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The methods which I have seen employed in Moscow have filled me 
with the most profound repugnance. Everywhere, back-door maneuvers calculated 
with the most extreme exaggeration to dissimulate with overblown revolutionary 
appearances an opportunist background. I would have preferred to get up and 
leave. But I decided to wait until the arrival of the second delegation, comrade 
Merges from Braunschweig...&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;To begin, I took a tour of Moscow, usually without official 
guides, in order to see things which I was not scheduled to visit.&#8221; Later, Rühle 
made a journey to central Russia: &#8220;Many impressions, more sad ones than pleasant 
ones. Russia suffers in every part and from every evil. How could it be 
otherwise? I could relate many facts, but the examples set by Crispien and 
Dittmann do not tempt me to imitate them. Who, after all, would benefit? Only 
the <i>adversaries</i> of communism. But all of these defects and all of these 
inconveniences do not constitute <i>evidence against communism</i>. Ultimately, 
they constitute evidence against the methods and tactics employed by Russia to 
realize communism. On this point, of course, it is necessary to make ourselves 
distinctly understood by our Russian comrades.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Rühle attacked the concept of centralism so prevalent among the 
Russians, which they had raised to the level of a &#8220;hypercentralism&#8221;. But &#8220;it is 
the revolution which has compelled them to act in this way. These men, the 
German representatives of the party organization, had their precious audience, 
when they became indignant and crossed themselves upon being faced by the 
dictatorial and terrorist aspects of Russia. If they had been in the position of 
the Soviet government, they would have acted in <i>exactly the same way</i> 
(...) What appears in Russia as a caricature is the consequence of a faulty, 
historically-superseded system. Centralism is the principle of organization 
proper to the <i>capitalist-bourgeois</i> era. Following this principle, one can 
construct the <i>Bourgeois State and the capitalist economy</i>. These must be 
dealt with by the council system. In Russia, however, the councils are nothing 
but shadows. A tentacle of the bureaucracy of the party dictatorship. But by 
relying on the bureaucracy Russia arrives at a caricature of communism, 
economically and politically; a communism of a barbarous State, sterile and 
unendurable.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Why have the Russian comrades made this error? Because they are 
prisoners of the belief in the <i>party</i>. Because they see the party as the 
means to bring about the revolution and the construction of socialism. The 
party, however, as a form of organization, is the incarnation of the centralist 
principle. This is <i>the source of their error</i>...&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;For the KAPD&#8212;unlike Moscow&#8212;the revolution <i>is not</i> a party 
matter, the party is not an authoritarian, top-down organization, the leader is 
not a military commander, the masses are not an army condemned to passive 
discipline, the dictatorship is not the despotism of a clique of leaders, 
communism is not used as a springboard for a new soviet bourgeoisie. For the 
KAPD, the revolution is an affair which concerns the proletarian class in its 
entirety; within this class is the party, which is only the vanguard, most 
mature and most determined. The masses must raise themselves to the level of the 
political maturity of this vanguard, but the KAPD does not expect this result to 
be obtained under the tutelage of leaders, discipline and regimentation. On the 
contrary: with an advanced proletariat, like the German proletariat, these 
methods obtain precisely the <i>opposite</i> result. Such methods stifle 
initiative, paralyze revolutionary activity, short-circuit the power of 
persuasion, and diminish the sense of responsibility. For the KAPD, it is a 
matter of giving free rein to the initiative of the masses, of freeing them from 
authority, of developing their self-consciousness, of nurturing their autonomy 
and thus increasing their participation in the revolution...&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Russia is not Germany, Russian politics is not German politics, 
and the Russian revolution is not the German revolution. <i>This is why the 
tactics of the Russian revolution cannot be applied to the German revolution</i>. 
Lenin could prove a hundred times that the tactics of the Bolsheviks were 
brilliantly illustrated in the Russian revolution&#8212;this would not make them, by 
any means, tactics suitable for the German revolution. We must rise up with 
determination against any attempt to impose these tactics upon us.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Nonetheless, Moscow has made this terrorist attempt. It wants to 
make its principle into the principle of the world revolution. The KPD is its 
agent. It works under Russian orders and according to the Russian plan. It is 
the phonograph of Moscow. Since it does not want to play this eunuch&#8217;s role, but 
has its own opinion, the KAPD is the object of a deadly hatred. Just read the 
insults, the calumnies and the poisonous insinuations with which we are 
fought&#8212;without any concern for the revolutionary situation in which we find 
ourselves, without any consideration for the impact which these evil practices 
could have among our bourgeois adversaries. Dr. Levi and Heckert owe us for all 
the filth which Radek and Zinoviev put into their hands. These scoundrels are 
paid to do this. But, despite everything, the KAPD would not get down on its 
knees; it was necessary that the Congress of the Third International should 
decree that it must yield to Moscow&#8217;s orders. Everything was magnificently 
prepared. The guillotine was ready. Radek, with a self-satisfied air, examined 
the blade&#8217;s edge. The supreme tribunal had already been seated. It would be a 
grand spectacle. This was how the Executive envisioned things would proceed. Too 
beautiful for reality.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... The dictatorship of the Bolsheviks is the dictatorship of 5% 
of a class over the other classes and over the other 95% of its own class...&#8221; 
The KAPD must not join the Communist International, &#8220;an association which 
accepts people who assume the responsibility for the terror exercised by a party 
over the Russian people.&#8221; And he would go even further in the <i>Communist 
Workers Daily</i> of Berlin (No. 146, November 1920): &#8220;The Russian workers are 
even more enslaved, oppressed and exploited than the German workers.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">In early July, Rühle was joined by another KAPD delegate, the 
former president of the socialist republic of Braunschweig&#8212;from the end of 1918 
to the beginning of 1919&#8212;August Merges. During the course of discussions with 
Lenin and Radek, they were made aware of the 21 Conditions proposed by the 
Executive Committee and upon which the Congress was to vote. Radek guaranteed 
that if they accepted the resolutions of the Congress, including the 21 
Conditions, the KAPD&#8217;s admission into the Communist International would pose no 
problem (since the result was known in advance). Rühle and Merges returned to 
Germany even before the Congress began. Levi, who had protested against the 
KAPD&#8217;s &#8220;over-representation&#8221;, since the KAPD had been granted a deliberative 
vote while the USPD and SFIO left wings had only consultative votes, was 
outvoted 25 to 5. But Rühle&#8217;s departure put an end to this dispute.</p>

<p class="fst">Upon Rühle&#8217;s return to Germany, the KAPD was divided: Rühle, <i>
Die Aktion</i> and the East Saxony and Hamburg districts, versus Berlin and the 
party majority who described Rühle&#8217;s conduct as a &#8220;grave error&#8221;. But the Second 
Congress of the KAPD (August) did not directly address the issue of resuming 
relations with the Communist International. It reacted violently against the 
&#8220;Open Letter&#8221; of the Executive Committee ordering the KAPD to merge with the 
KPD, and also against the Executive Committee&#8217;s plan to &#8220;meddle in the internal 
affairs of other parties&#8221;. The KAPD, in this connection, invoked a principle 
which it had by no means respected itself, since it called for solidarity 
between the KAPD and the Executive Committee against the KPD.</p>

<p class="fst">Instead of admitting with Rühle that there was no common ground 
at all between the Left and the Communist International, the KAPD majority 
believed that further discussion was possible. It was from this perspective that 
Gorter wrote his <i>Open Letter to Comrade Lenin</i> in the summer of 1920, in 
response to <i>Infantile Disorder</i>. He wanted to convince Lenin that the 
KAPD&#8217;s positions were correct for Western Europe, and to lead him to admit, at 
the same time, the falsehood of certain arguments in <i>Infantile Disorder</i>, 
and to rectify his information about the Left. Like the majority of his party, 
Gorter did not see that the Communist International&#8217;s attitude towards the KAPD 
was based upon the International&#8217;s intention of &#8220;recovering its best elements&#8221;. 
Lenin wrote in <i>Infantile Disorder</i> that the KAPD had &#8220;the advantage of 
knowing how to carry out propaganda among the masses better than the other 
parties&#8221;. Once again, the Left wasted its time by allowing itself to be deceived 
by politicians. During a session of the KAPD Central Committee which took place 
between October 30<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> and 31<sup style="font-size: 80%">st</sup>, 1920, Rühle was excluded, 
and the decision was made to send a third delegation to Moscow.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">The Third Congress and the Split</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The KAPD delegation to the Third World Congress was composed of 
Gorter, Schröder and Rasch (Schröder was the political leader of the KAPD, while 
Gorter was its principle theoretician). Its objective was to allow the KAPD to 
at least get a foothold within the Communist International in order to create a 
revolutionary opposition within it.</p>

<p class="fst">The delegation attended various sessions of the Executive 
Committee.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> Gorter expounded his theses on November 24. Trotsky answered him in a 
speech which contained the essential points of the best counter-arguments 
(although of a partial nature), which would later be reappropriated by the 
Italian Left in its critique of the German Left.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> He reproached Gorter for 
attempting to reduce revolutionary problems to &#8220;an organizational modification&#8221;. 
He accused Gorter of wanting a small <i>propagandist</i> party rather than a 
party <i>organization</i> of the whole class. It was possible, Trotsky said, 
that the experience of the Dutch SDP had influenced more than just the size of 
the KAPD. It was false, he said, to maintain that the primary goal was to 
transform the consciousness of the workers. Trotsky, like Bordiga after him, 
compared this illusion (which is only a partial depiction of the German Left&#8217;s 
position) to the nationalists of the 18<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century and their <i>
Aufklärung</i>. But the reform of consciousness was a characteristic feature of 
the era. This amounted to a distorted dialogue, in which it was easy for Trotsky 
to refer to truths by avoiding the questions which were effectively posed, but 
poorly-expressed by the actions of the German Left: their insufficient 
expression was the theoretical reflection of the weakness and contradictions of 
the practical conduct of the proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky was correct, of course, to recall that &#8220;the most 
important source of the revolution is still necessity&#8221;, and to situate the 
&#8220;degree of education&#8221; of the masses in its proper place. But educationalism did 
not yet characterize the German Left as it would later.<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> Gorter did not 
consider consciousness to be something which comes <i>before</i> action, as it 
does in the Kautskyist view, in which the proletariat could not become conscious 
except after having been inoculated by socialist ideas. In its practice, the 
Left, despite certain imprecise formulas, which are often produced by any 
revolutionary tendency, considered that clarification must be attained through <i>
action</i> and not pedagogy. The Communist International, Lenin, and later the 
Italian Left, chose to attack only the weakest points of the German Left by 
focusing on its idealist formulations. In his <i>Open Letter to Comrade Lenin</i>, 
Gorter noted how Lenin, instead of attacking positions which had been 
&#8220;officially adopted, often attacks the &#8216;private&#8217; declarations of the KAPD. The 
same holds true for his charge of organizational &#8216;fetishism&#8217;&#8221;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The German Left, throughout its first years, demonstrated that 
it possessed a sufficiently healthy instinct by not theorizing too much about 
the form of the <i>unionen</i>, but only about their content, thus leaving the 
possibilities open to the future revolutionary movement ... one must add, 
however, that, with respect to the &#8216;economic&#8217; analyses of the <i>unionen</i>, 
there were (particularly in the AAU-E) councilist idealizations concerning the 
organizational bases of the <i>unionen</i>... &#8221;<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Finally, on December 5, the KAPD was admitted into the Communist 
International &#8220;provisionally, as a sympathizing party with a voice but without a 
vote&#8221;. Its admission was provisional as a result of the fact that all the 
resolutions of the Executive Committee concerning the KAPD demanded that the 
KAPD should soon rejoin the KPD. The KAPD thus obtained a permanent seat on the 
Executive Committee of the Communist International, occupied first by Goldstein 
and later by Reichenbach. Upon their return to Germany, the members of the 
delegation were very optimistic and exaggerated their achievements. Nonetheless, 
the Executive Committee had contributed eight million marks for KAPD activities. 
The KAPD even moved to reopen contacts with the VKPD, which was then undergoing 
its first turn towards the left. At no time, however, did the KAPD cease to 
criticize the Bolsheviks and their German &#8220;fraternal party&#8221;. The Third Congress 
of the KAPD (February 1921) ratified the party&#8217;s membership in the Communist 
International. During this period, numerous communists did not deny the 
revolutionary character of the German Left. In January 1921, Humbert-Droz wrote: 
&#8220;The KAPD constitutes a reaction, somewhat unfortunate in its manner of 
expression, but necessary for its revolutionary spirit, against the policies of 
the <i>Spartakusbund</i> and the USPD.&#8221;<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But after the news of the rebellions of the Russian proletarians 
against the government, and the March Action, in which the VKPD demonstrated its 
inability to lead a revolutionary action, the KAPD rejected any idea of merging 
with the KPD.</p>

<p class="fst">After the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party, Zinoviev 
announced that the next world congress &#8220;would emphasize&#8221; the question of the 
KAPD. For its part, the KAPD prepared a packet of materials to publicize its 
theses to the delegates. In May, it sent a delegation to see if it was possible 
to create a leftist fraction within the Communist International. The delegation 
was composed of Meyer (pseudonym: Bergmann), a metal worker from Leipzig who had 
directly participated in the struggles at Leuna during March, Jan Appel 
(pseudonym: Hempel), Sachs and Reichenbach.</p>

<p class="fst">The Left&#8217;s interventions at the Congress demonstrated that the 
major difference separating the Left from the Bolsheviks consisted in the fact 
that the Left based its tactics on the <i>power of capital</i>. Gorter&#8217;s <i>Open 
Letter to Comrade Lenin</i> had reproached Lenin for underestimating the power 
of capital&#8217;s unity in Europe and the USA: &#8220;The left ... bases its tactics on 
this unified power.&#8221; Hempel highlighted the &#8220;economic division within the 
working class&#8221; produced by unemployment. In his critique of Trotsky&#8217;s report on 
the world economic situation, Sachs explained how the bourgeoisie used the 
economy as a <i>social weapon</i> against the proletariat, and how it strove to 
&#8220;maintain the economy as class struggle&#8221;. The Leninist position was totally 
different: on the eve of the Second Congress, Zinoviev was still asking about 
which road (revolutionary or non-revolutionary) the trade unions &#8220;would 
choose&#8221;.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Contrary to what Lenin had said in his speech on tactics, when he 
had &#8220;demagogically&#8221; aroused laughter among his audience, it was not a question 
of asking oneself whether it was possible to make the revolution by remaining in 
isolation.<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a> The regrouping of a sufficient number of revolutionaries is 
necessary: but the revolutionaries cannot win over the majority of the workers <i>
before</i> a revolutionary period. The Communist International was mistaken in 
its dispute with the Left when it insisted that revolutionaries must not 
hesitate to work in reactionary institutions (trade unions, parliaments, etc.), 
as if the Left was above all concerned with preserving its purity. This was, of 
course, a temptation for some, but was not the Left&#8217;s primary concern. The enemy 
would be strengthened by making people believe that the proletariat could use 
parliament, or that the trade union structure was acceptable.</p>

<p class="fst">The Communist International&#8217;s reaction to the March Action offers 
an excellent illustration of the International&#8217;s contradictions. The Third 
Congress resolved nothing, since it supported the Central Committee and was in 
favor of the strengthening of the KPD through its penetration of the masses. The 
final formula, rendering facile homage to the March Action, described as a &#8220;step 
forward&#8221;, elevated the unity of the party above all other considerations: rather 
than unity, however, a crisis ensued (cf. the preceding chapter). Contrary to 
what Trotsky said,<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a> the presence of numerically powerful Communist Parties 
in Germany (400,000), France (120,000-130,000) and Czechoslovakia (350,000) was 
not synonymous with revolutionary progress. The flood of members into the 
Communist Parties was a sign of the crisis of traditional reformism, not of the 
emergence of a new revolutionary movement. Deceived by the trade unions and 
socialist parties from the pre-1914 period, numerous workers turned to 
&#8220;communism&#8221; and the Red Trade Union International merely in order to conduct 
consistent reformist struggles, nothing more. Trotsky misinterpreted this shift: 
&#8220;We now have real mass communist parties in Germany, France, Czechoslovakia, 
Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria... An enormous tidal wave!&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;With the nascent theorization of the &#8216;united front&#8217;, the Third 
International proved that it had the same view of the &#8216;workers movement&#8217; as the 
Second International: there was a &#8216;workers movement&#8217;, which was now 
unfortunately divided, but which had fundamental common interests upon which a 
political-trade union collaboration could be based.&#8221;<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One could add to the KAPD&#8217;s report on this Congress that its 
delegates were treated like intruders in an assembly where &#8220;serious politics&#8221; 
were being deliberated. All the other delegates were hostile towards them; even 
Radek and the other leading personalities of the Congress went out of their way 
to ridicule them. Lenin began one of his speeches with this phrase: &#8220;I, too, 
will allow myself to go on the offensive...&#8221; Radek and Trotsky were constantly 
comparing the KAPD delegates to the Mensheviks and the &#8220;two and a half 
International&#8221; (Martov, Kautsky, etc.). Bukharin&#8217;s intervention took the 
following form: &#8220;With your permission, we must tell these comrades: these goals, 
these ideas, totally unite the KAPD with its detested enemy, with Paul Levi. 
They rest upon the same theoretical basis as Levi. (Shouts from the KAPD 
delegates: and in practice?) If theory is one thing for them, and practice 
another, this is proof of their utterly confused spirit...&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Roland-Holst, in defense of the KAPD, declared that it would be 
useful for the Communist International to have an opposition, and that the 
leadership of the Congress did not respect the &#8220;idea of justice&#8221; in relation to 
the KAPD, by not granting it the same possibilities for expression as the other 
parties. She had previously presented a more powerful defense of the KAPD in the 
journal <i>Kommunismus</i> (cf. the next chapter),<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a> &#8220;The organ of the 
International for Central and Eastern Europe&#8221;. Roland-Holst would leave the 
Communist Party in 1927; demanding freedom of expression for the opposition 
groups, and presciently announcing that: &#8220;Demagogic opportunism goes hand in 
hand with dogmatic rigidity&#8221;, which had been clear at least since 1921.<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">The Workers Opposition and the KAPD</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Quite surprisingly, for the KAPD, the Workers Opposition was the 
only tendency at the Congress which went beyond a simple, courteous critique of 
the Bolsheviks. Intervening in the debate on the tactics of the Russian 
Communist Party, Kollontai devoted most of her speech to a criticism of the New 
Economic Policy adopted by the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist 
Party.<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a> The principle issue was to discover whether or not this decisive turn 
in economic policy would in fact serve to consolidate the foundations and 
accelerate the formation of a new system of communist production in Russia. 
Kollontai responded in the negative: &#8220;These days, the capitalist order exists 
throughout the world&#8221; and communism is the only system which can guarantee the 
development of the forces of production. Insofar as it is a detour within 
capitalism, and risks a return to capitalism, the NEP must therefore be 
rejected, if only from the economic point of view.</p>

<p class="fst">Furthermore, from the point of view of class relations in Russia, 
the NEP was a massive concession to the Russian peasants who wanted capitalism. 
It leads to the total isolation of the working class from the other two 
&#8220;classes&#8221; (the quotation marks are ours): the peasants, and the bureaucracy 
which is progressively replacing the moribund bourgeoisie. This bureaucracy 
includes the State apparatus and the party machine, the managerial layers of the 
economy and the specialists. With the NEP, the working class loses its role as 
the driving force behind the development of Russian society. If, furthermore, 
the revolution does not break out soon enough, the concessions of the NEP will 
lead to the admission &#8220;that the communist principles upon which our policies 
have been based were not suitable for the realization of our aims. This would 
discourage the workers. These concessions destroy the confidence of the working 
class in communism and lead the peasantry to believe that all of our economic 
growth is due to its efforts. These concessions eliminate the confidence in the 
fact that the workers can achieve something by their own autonomous efforts, 
that they can realize the communist system in Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Kollontai advocated an alternative: &#8220;Utilize the creative power 
of the proletariat which has never really been used. Enemy forces prevent the 
expression of this power. Lenin says nothing about it in his speech about the 
means required to get the economy moving; he restricts himself to the technical 
aspect of the question (machines, electricity, foreign specialists, etc.). 
Nonetheless, the essential point is rooted in the fact that &#8216;our current system 
obstructs the initiative of the proletariat&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If we should continue down the road of these concessions, I 
greatly fear that we might arrive at a situation in which, when the revolution 
breaks out in other countries, it will already be too late, that the conscious, 
just, proletarian nucleus here will have disappeared... It will be necessary, 
for the proletarians, to make a new revolution in Russia to realize communism.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Understanding that, despite everything, the NEP was inevitable, 
she concluded as follows: &#8220;The only thing that can save us would be the 
existence within our party of a nucleus bound to our old tried and true 
principles, and that this nucleus should be present at the moment when this 
revolution breaks out among us. And should this decisive turn affect all soviet 
policies and create a non-communist, simply soviet republic out of our communist 
republic, this tried and true nucleus of communists should be there to pick up 
the flag of the revolution and help achieve the victory of communism throughout 
the world.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Kollontai nurtured all the illusions of her epoch. Communism is 
conceived as the management of the economy by the workers and she does not take 
the critique of political economy into account. She makes consciousness 
autonomous in respect to the social process: an idea which consists in believing 
that a conscious revolutionary nucleus could &#8220;maintain its existence&#8221; through an 
indeterminate period of reaction. The initiative of the proletariat consequently 
also becomes an autonomous factor. The illusion is completed with reference to 
the aptitude of what was left of the Russian proletariat, which had launched a 
reformist struggle against the Bolsheviks and demanded (like the peasants) the 
NEP, even before the Tenth Congress had voted in favor of it. The striking 
Petrograd workers had asked for <i>free trade</i> between the city and the 
countryside.<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a> Finally, she maintained the illusion concerning the ability of 
living labor (the proletariat), in general, to make up for the insufficient 
accumulation of dead (fixed) capital. This was, forty years in advance, the 
ideology of the Chinese &#8220;great leap forward&#8221;, which would be used by all those 
who want to increase the rate of exploitation of the proletariat: fascists, 
third world bureaucrats, etc., Kollontai not excepted. It is a distinct form of 
the &#8220;workers utopia&#8221;. Kristman, the theoretician of war communism, wrote in 
October 1919 in the <i>Autocracy of the Proletariat in the Factory</i>: 
&#8220;colossal forces lie dormant in the proletariat&#8221;.<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a> What is of interest in the 
Workers Opposition and its contradiction derive from the fact that it was both 
the <i>workers</i> solution for Russian capitalist development and the 
expression of a defeated proletarian movement (primarily due to its 
international isolation, but also because of the destruction of the revolution 
from within, undermined by the rebirth of capitalist relations which had been 
reintroduced, against their will, by the Bolsheviks).</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD delegates held interviews after the Congress opened with 
several leaders of the Workers Opposition. Kollontai gave them the manuscript of <i>
The Workers Opposition</i>. According to Reichenbach, Kollontai later submitted 
to party discipline, and asked the KAPD after the Congress to return her 
manuscript: but a courier had already brought it to Berlin where the KAPD had 
immediately published it. In any event, when questioned about the matter the 
following year at the Fourth World Congress (November-December 1922), Kollontai 
preferred to remain silent.<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In one of his interventions at the Third Congress, addressing the 
Russian question, Hempel repeated the gist of Kollontai&#8217;s arguments. Trotsky&#8217;s 
response was a masterpiece of bad faith and falsehood, evocative of his future 
assassins. The leaders of the ex-revolution became the leaders of the 
counterrevolution.</p>

<p class="fst">Some time later, a new letter from the Executive Committee of the 
Communist International, addressed &#8220;To the Members of the Communist Workers 
Party of Germany&#8221;, stated: &#8220;In the most important questions, your leaders&#8217; 
arguments coincide with those of the declared counterrevolution and the 
Mensheviks.&#8221;<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a> Zinoviev would later admit that he had fought the left when the 
right was much stronger.<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD explained the Communist International&#8217;s position by 
reference to the pressure of the Russian party which had only carried out &#8220;a 
proletarian and communist revolution in appearance, or at least only a small 
part of it. It was, in reality, primarily a democratic and peasant revolution. 
It is this contradiction, which had remained concealed for some time, which has 
condemned the international tactics of the soviet republic and the communist 
party: dictatorship, blind obedience, hypercentralism, etc.&#8221;. The KAPD foresaw 
that the Russian State would carry ever more weight in the Communist 
International, for which &#8220;the revolution will be increasingly reduced to a mere 
word, with, perhaps, some putsches every now and then&#8221;.<a href="#n38" name="fn38" target="_self">[38]</a> In 1923, Gorter 
still interpreted Kronstadt as a peasant phenomenon.<a href="#n39" name="fn39" target="_self">[39]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This was a constantly recurring theme among many on the Left: 
Gorter, in mid-1918, had expounded the same theme in <i>The World Revolution</i>. 
Pannekoek, however, went much further: <i>World Revolution and Communist Tactics</i> 
suggests that the Russian revolution should not be viewed only in connection 
with Germany, but also with <i>Asia</i>: &#8220;Asia&#8217;s cause is humanity&#8217;s cause.&#8221; We 
have already seen how (cf. Chapter 3) he had entertained a global strategy in 
1912. In 1920, he had come to connect the European workers movement with the 
&#8220;great revolt of Asia against western European capital&#8221;. His vision is broader 
than Gorter&#8217;s, who limited himself to theorizing the isolation of the European 
proletarians in relation to other geographical areas. For Pannekoek, a 
proletarian offensive in China or the Indies could lead to a reactivation of the 
movement in the &#8220;advanced&#8221; countries.</p>

<p class="fst">This comparison of Pannekoek and Gorter&#8212;who was closer to the 
activity of the revolutionary workers and consequently more of a prisoner of 
their deficiencies in Germany&#8212;gives rise to the thought that Gorter also 
theorized (like Lenin, but in the contrary sense) the limitations of the 
movement. Its disregard of the agrarian question demonstrated the determination 
and the strength of the German proletariat but it also showed that it had not 
begun a <i>communist revolution</i> in the relations of production. Kollontai 
and Gorter became the defenders of exclusively working class interests in a 
situation which increasingly appeared to be a revolutionary deadlock. Each saw 
the solution in a future revolution (even in Russia), one of whose preconditions 
would be the preservation of a revolutionary &#8220;nucleus&#8221;.</p>
