<h3><a name="h1">The Impact of Social Democracy</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Germany possessed the world&#8217;s most important socialist party; no 
other could compare with it. The SPD (<i>Sozial-demokratische Partei 
Deutschlands</i>) counted a million members and four million voters in 1914. It 
was also the largest political party in Germany. This was primarily the result 
of the numerical importance of the German working class; Germany&#8217;s workers 
comprised a large proportion of its population, although less than that 
comprised by Great Britain&#8217;s workers. Germany was more working class than France 
(which was still largely rural) and the United States, where the tertiary sector 
underwent rapid development.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> The SPD&#8217;s influence can also be explained by the 
fact that the proletariat was an interested party in the struggle for democracy, 
and conceived of the socialist party as a suitable instrument for conducting 
this struggle. Finally, due to the bourgeoisie&#8217;s weakness, Germany did not have 
a strong liberal party such as existed in England, or a radical party as in 
France. The SPD appeared to non-proletarian democrats as the only party which 
effectively fought for democracy: one of the best &#8220;proofs&#8221; of this was 
Bismarck&#8217;s prohibition of the party between 1878 and 1890.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> The SPD 
represented this extensive constituency quite well, since its activity to 
improve the condition of the workers in the dominant society was limited to 
reformist and parliamentary action. Even before 1914, basically since its birth 
at the Gotha Congress of 1875<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a>, the SPD, considered in all of its aspects, was 
not a revolutionary organization. The talk of &#8220;treason&#8221; in 1914 shows that it 
was judged exclusively by what it <i>said</i>. Pannekoek&#8217;s analyses, the only 
radical contributions on this terrain, prove that there was no discontinuity 
between the periods before and after August 4, 1914.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Pannekoek was Dutch, and his native country&#8217;s small size 
helped him to view things from an international perspective. In Germany, on the 
other hand, the SPD totally dominated the entire political horizon of the 
various tendencies which claimed to be Marxist, including, among others, the 
most radical elements around Rosa Luxemburg.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> Overawed by the power of the 
&#8220;party&#8221;, the left&#8212;which represented approximately 15% of the SPD&#8212;having 
originated in a critique of the reformist practice of the <i>leadership</i> of 
the party in all fields, and never abandoning the labor of Sisyphus of trying to 
unseat that leadership, did not take the decisive step toward schism. The left 
in its entirety would wait until it would be excluded from the party, after 
1914, to forge its own organizations. In addition, there were also, prior to 
1914, &#8220;revisionist&#8221; (Bernstein) and &#8220;orthodox&#8221; (Kautsky) tendencies: the latter 
was apparently the majority faction. But it soon became clear, after August 4, 
1914, that the majority was more right-wing than the &#8220;revisionists&#8221;. Bernstein, 
moreover, would be excluded as a &#8220;leftist&#8221; opponent of the leadership.</p>

<p class="fst">It is necessary to closely examine the positions and activities 
of Rosa Luxemburg during the revolutionary period as well as the previous years. 
Because she was heavily criticized by the Leninists, and because she criticized 
Lenin and the Bolsheviks both long before as well as during the 1917 revolution, 
proletarian revolutionaries often tend to make her the spokesperson and to 
consider her as <i>the theoretician</i> (and as a model of practice while she 
was alive) of the authentically revolutionary current. This opinion was 
nourished by the left factions themselves, which soon overlooked the fact that 
they had opposed her at the KPD&#8217;s founding congress. The clarification of the 
history of the communist left in Germany leads to the destruction of the legend 
to which her death gave birth.</p>

<p class="fst">Luxemburg&#8217;s critique of Lenin&#8217;s organizational fetishism (see <i>
Organizational Questions of Russian Social Democracy</i>) was one aspect of her 
critique of workers organizations. The basis of her critique was still more 
clearly expounded in <i>The Mass Strike, Party and Trade Unions</i>: the 
organizations, and particularly their leaderships, necessarily followed in the 
wake of the spontaneous movements of the proletariat, and usually even tried to 
restrain these movements. This was in absolute conformity with what can normally 
be verified with respect to the relation between the established organizations 
of the working class and the movements of the working class (whether or not they 
lead to revolutions). Luxemburg correctly saw this as inevitable, but did not 
for that reason cease to view the parties, trade unions, etc., which were formed 
in the non-revolutionary period and which embraced large sectors of the 
proletariat, as organizations which are perhaps bad, but ultimately are still 
class organizations, which the proletariat must rejuvenate during the 
revolution. This is why she opposed the Dutch Left, which split from the 
reformist Dutch party (see Chapter 3), as well as the German &#8220;left radicals&#8221;, 
instead calling upon the masses to &#8220;reconquer&#8221; their organization (the SPD). 
According to her, one must not separate oneself from the masses even when they 
follow the &#8220;worst&#8221; workers party.</p>

<p class="fst">Her position was based on two theses which had proven to be 
increasingly false: first, that the &#8220;workers&#8221; organizations only possess a 
relative autonomy in respect to the workers movement; and second, &#8220;the masses&#8221; 
are, at bottom, revolutionary (or at least never counterrevolutionary).</p>

<p class="fst">The German Revolution has clearly proven what various &#8220;lefts&#8221; had 
intuited: the workers parties had acquired so much autonomy (in respect to the 
revolutionary movement, but not to capital) that they were the most skilled 
architects of the counterrevolution; in this manner, the revolutionary 
proletariat was defeated by the counterrevolutionary proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">Luxemburg wanted to establish a compromise between these two 
elements. The Bolsheviks branded her position as centrist at the Zimmerwald 
Conference on the war and social democracy (see Chapter 4); and her position was 
in fact basically centrist. It corresponded perfectly with that sector of the 
workers movement in Germany, organized by the &#8220;shop stewards&#8221; during the war, 
which attempted to achieve positive results in the reformist struggle, with 
&#8220;real&#8221; material benefits and policies (in opposition to the manifest sabotage of 
all actions by the trade unions and the social democrats). They wanted to return 
to social democracy&#8217;s origins without advancing towards communism. They did not 
want revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The Luxemburgian critique of organizational fetishism was carried 
out in the name of the fetishism of the masses; her critique of &#8220;isolation&#8221; (in 
the case of the Dutch Left prior to 1914) was carried out in the name of the 
fetishism of action. This explains why she remained, until her death, on the 
side of the masses in the insurrection of January 1919, whose failure she had 
nonetheless predicted. Her attitude recalls the fetishism of the people among 
the great bourgeois revolutionaries, but in the era of the proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">August 1914 was the consequence of a long evolution. The 
anarchist movement has never ceased to refer to it, and has all too hastily 
viewed it as the failure of &#8220;Marxism&#8221;, since there were many &#8220;government 
anarchists&#8221; (following Malatesta&#8217;s formulation) who defended the sacred union on 
this or that side. We shall cite only the cases of Kropotkin and J. Guillaume. 
Anarchism has in particular placed much more emphasis on the organizational 
roots of the failure of the Second International than on its real causes. 
Contrary to what Marx and Engels said, the revolutionary movement underwent a 
&#8220;real&#8221; split after the Commune.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> &#8220;Anarchism&#8221; and &#8220;Marxism&#8221; cannot explain 
either of the two, since the Marxist movement preserved and developed certain 
aspects which proved useful in 1914 (revolutionary defeatism). This did not 
prevent both of them, however, from retaining remnants of the communist 
perspective, but only in the form of parts removed from a totality, which they 
could not grasp intellectually because the proletariat no longer grasped it 
practically. The notion of community had become weakened and the &#8220;socialists&#8221; 
began to place all their hopes in the State: socialization was thus identified 
with nationalization or municipal ownership. Certain &#8220;anarchists&#8221; still 
persisted in upholding an old tradition involving the search for community, but 
did not clarify the problem of class, oscillating between reformism and savage 
revolts. In their activity they, too, made the revolution a question of <i>
organization</i>, of the proper formula which would allow emancipation. Some 
Marxists also preserved the perspective of community, although in a 
contradictory way. In his description of the future society, Bebel<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> heralded 
the disappearance of value, but not of the social regulation of the production 
of goods through <i>necessary labor time</i>, which is the very origin of 
value.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> Kautsky clearly foresaw the end of the law of value ... but preserved 
wages and prices. The transformation was presented as a series of governmental 
measures instituted by the &#8220;Socialist State&#8221;: it is organized capitalism.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> In 
1916, Bukharin would assert that it was not a question of developing the forces 
of production, which were already quite sufficient for the passage to socialism, 
but of destroying capital, which places obstacles in the way of that 
transformation. Such ideas were rare during that era, even after 1914. Pannekoek 
was one of the few who were aware of the <i>partial</i> character of both the 
socialist and anarchist movements. In 1909 he wrote: &#8220;the one-sided 
revolutionary wing of the workers movement thus acquires an anti-political 
character. In France and Italy ministerialism and the formation of electoral 
blocs have expanded the audience of revolutionary syndicalism and have led the 
trade unions to declare themselves enemies of the party.&#8221;<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It would be useless to denounce a &#8220;collapse&#8221;, as Lenin did, who 
confused the issue with his talk of &#8220;opportunism&#8221;. As Engels defined it, the 
notion of opportunism (rehabilitated by Lenin) turned reality on its head. 
Engels equated opportunism with an emphasis on day-to-day activity and 
bread-and-butter issues, and not with the real social fact of social democracy 
organizing labor in opposition to <i>and</i> in partnership with capital. This 
fits in with his superficial analysis of the workers movement of his era, which 
would later be employed by Lenin and the CI in their analyses of the socialist 
movement.</p>

<p class="fst">In reality, if one wants to speak of opportunism, one would have 
to accuse the whole proletariat (and it is evidently a matter for accusation, 
since opportunism is a moral notion) of being opportunist throughout the entire 
epoch. The workers fought for immediate advantages because the flourishing 
condition of capitalism allowed them to do so. This reformist foundation was 
transformed, in certain situations, into its opposite: revolutionary action, 
whether because the proletariat&#8217;s situation became unendurable, or because 
society&#8217;s rulers themselves descended into crisis, or, as in the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> 
century, due to the impetus of bourgeois revolutions; there is no hard and fast 
line between revolution and reformism; there is an irremediable opposition 
between the petrified forms of reformism (which are often even unsuitable for an 
&#8220;honest reformism&#8221;) and revolutionary forms of organization; there is a bloody 
struggle between the proletariat which remains reformist and the proletariat 
which becomes revolutionary, but to oppose the proletariat (which &#8220;is 
revolutionary or does not exist&#8221;) on one side, to the working class, &#8220;mere 
variable capital&#8221;, on the other, pertains to the realm of metaphysics.</p>

<p class="fst">In their early days, social democracy and the German trade unions 
comprised the organization of this spontaneous reformist struggle of the German 
proletariat, which demonstrated its lack of subversive spirit by the very fact 
of separating its political and economic struggles in distinct organizations. 
Soon, however, a line was drawn between the workers organizations and the 
workers movement <i>per se</i>: this became clear when the workers movement 
developed various forms of action which opposed the traditional organizations 
during the wildcat strikes of the first years of the 20<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century; 
this development would become yet more pronounced with the creation of the &#8220;shop 
stewards&#8221; networks during the war. Henceforth, the traditional workers 
organizations, the SPD and the trade unions, had their own logic and their own 
function in the existing society: this is what must be understood (as the Dutch 
did so well, splitting from the SDAP before 1910); the grave reproach of 
&#8220;opportunism&#8221; is nothing but an empty phrase: its employment reveals the bad 
conscience of the organization that feeds on the energy of the proletariat, 
which is what social democracy had become.</p>

<p class="fst">It is, then, impossible for revolutionaries to be in workers 
organizations (like Engels) or to try to deal with them (like Lenin), so as to 
guide their transformation (Engels) or to unmask them (Lenin). These 
organizations cannot be transformed because they have their own nature, nor can 
they be unmasked, because, while they may be susceptible to the reproach of 
being somewhat lax in the reformist struggle, they cannot be held accountable 
for their lack of revolutionary spirit, since the workers are reformist anyway. 
In which case, the only way to conquer what one may call the workers 
movement&#8212;organizations which have become autonomous of the workers&#8212;is, wherever 
possible, to decisively attack it, even if this attack is carried out by a 
minority.</p>

<p class="fst">All talk of &#8220;opportunism&#8221; assumed that the social democratic 
party was really founded upon principles which it betrayed in its political 
activities. In reality, these principles had never been more than a smokescreen. 
Twenty years of denunciations of the always-renewed opportunism of a party which 
was not actually what it had initially proposed itself to be at its first 
congresses and which had revealed a nature which had nothing to do with the 
organization of revolutionary proletarians, were of no significance at all. The 
party had become an established body within the society which it had 
theoretically claimed had to be completely transformed. It preferred the status 
quo, its preservation, against the revolution (or even against the simple 
autonomous actions of the workers in their attempts to obtain reforms) which 
could, in case it failed, threaten the integrity of the organization and the 
extremely privileged social situation of its functionaries. It is in relation to 
this real function and these real principles behind its activity that the acts 
of social democracy must be judged in advance.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, one cannot accuse a party of being opportunist unless 
one assumes that it is actually a revolutionary party which has ceased to be 
revolutionary as a result of its resort to certain easy measures to attain its 
goal, measures which in fact will by no means allow the goal to be reached. Such 
a reproach can only be valid for a short time. The party either rapidly moves 
towards a form of activity which is in conformity with its goal and its 
principles (thus showing that it had only undergone a momentary and 
non-essential deviation, connected, for example, to its temporary domination by 
leaders who are effectively strangers to the revolutionary movement)&#8212;this case 
is very rare; it has probably never happened and only presents the obverse of a 
false symmetry&#8212;or else its first deviations are confirmed by others, which 
verifies that the party was in no way revolutionary, that its nature and its 
goal are power for itself, for its leaders, and that in any event, what is most 
important for it is its own preservation and consequently that of the existing 
order. In this case the reproach of opportunism must be abandoned, since it 
still implies a certain community with those against whom it is directed. This 
is why Gorter&#8217;s resort to this term in applying it to the Dutch Communist Party 
in 1919 is fully justified. The party had been undergoing a critical period of 
development for several years, and Gorter thought that it still had a healthy 
nucleus; as he said: &#8220;We hope that these leaders might adopt a better tactic.&#8221; 
In regard to social democracy this judgment of a politics which was even more 
rightist was disseminated for decades. Social democracy had assumed the role of 
the long-term defense of the interests of capital. One of the merits of the 
German Left would be that of showing that the Second International had fulfilled 
its role, that it had not &#8220;failed&#8221;, and in this respect the German Left was more 
advanced than the Italian Left. Without going so far, numerous Anglo-Saxon 
historians emphasize the continuity of social democracy, whereas leftist 
historians highlight the &#8220;rupture&#8221; of 1914. In West Germany, the &#8220;democratic&#8221; 
tradition of the German workers movement is the favorite theme, while in East 
Germany, historians focus on the &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; tradition of the SPD prior to 
1914.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">The Era of 1848</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The Brockhaus Encyclopedia of 1846 notes that the term <i>
proletariat</i> &#8220;has recently been applied to the lowest social layers with the 
least property.&#8221;<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> Hegel had already used it in 1821 to designate those who 
were not capable of supporting themselves and who had fallen into dependence 
upon others. The most active categories of the working class during this period 
were the master craftsmen, skilled workers and apprentices (who together 
comprised 10% of the population), although the decline in craft-based trades 
brought with it a reduction in the number of master craftsmen. Skilled workers 
still comprised a minority in the factories. The formation of the working class 
is a process of social disintegration. Torn from an ancient mode of existence, 
the worker clung to that existence and found there part of the energy needed to 
rebel against his new conditions.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> The image of the golden, 
pre-&#8220;bureaucratic&#8221; age of the workers movement, where the worker launched 
wildcat strikes free from any noxious constraints, is as unreal as that of a 
brutalized and inert proletariat. Modern proletarian movements were born during 
this transitional period, and modern theoretical communism is their most 
inclusive and universal expression. Social democracy, and particularly the 
German Social Democracy, would be born of the failure and demise of this early 
movement, from which it would derive its theory as an ideology without making it 
the theory of its effective <i>practice</i>.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> The proletariat is not and 
never was pure negativity. Otherwise, one could never understand how, even in 
that epoch, conservative forces could prevent its rebellion and integrate it, 
nor could one form a comprehensive vision of the whole era which could explain 
why there was no revolution in 1918-1921.</p>

<p class="fst">German workers, at that time a small minority of the population, 
found it very difficult to link their actions to those of the agricultural 
population, who were divided into two large distinct sectors in the middle of 
the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century: the farmers of the north and the southwest, where 
land ownership was relatively dispersed, and the farm laborers of the east (1.5 
million, of whom one-third were Poles), where serfdom was abolished, but who 
were still dependents of the landowners. At the end of the 18<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> 
century, Silesia was shaken by peasant agitation against the landowners&#8217; efforts 
to increase their statutory corvée.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The prohibition of workers associations between 1731 and 
1840 only partially destroyed the old solidarity of the medieval guilds. For the 
workers, German backwardness was not just a negative factor; it also allowed for 
the survival of collective forms of action. Mutual aid funds for the unemployed 
and invalids among the skilled workers were becoming more tolerated: among, for 
example, the printers concentrated in Leipzig who were threatened by 
technological progress. Strikes and boycotts were generally used in reaction to 
deteriorating conditions, and more rarely to obtain improvements. Despite the 
arrests of many strikers as a result of the prompt joint action of the factory 
owners and the authorities, the last years of the 18<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century 
witnessed a large number of strikes between 1791 and 1795 which were linked to 
the French Revolution. Twenty thousand workers carried out a one-week general 
strike in Hamburg in 1791, which ended only with the intervention of the army. 
In Breslau, in 1793, the firing of a Hungarian worker led to a strike and more 
than 200 arrests. The city, which at that time counted 50,000 inhabitants, was 
the scene of daily demonstrations in which thousands of workers participated. 
The disturbances spread to the countryside; troops killed 37 people. The strike 
was brought to a conclusion on the basis of a compromise: the worker was 
re-hired.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> These movements never attained the extent of the Luddite agitation 
in England, however.</p>

<p class="fst">At the beginning of the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century, a Rhinelander, 
L. Gall, attributed the source of wealth to labor: &#8220;everything which ennobles 
and perpetuates life exists as a result of <i>labor</i>, but it is nonetheless 
precisely the <i>class of laborers</i> which suffers from the scarcity of what 
it has itself created.&#8221;<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> The Silesian riots of June 1844, which were 
discussed by the whole revolutionary movement of the epoch, occasioned the 
celebrated debate between A. Ruge and Marx.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> Silesian industry had benefited 
from the Continental blockade, but the weavers were being decimated by the 
development of productivity. After the mistreatment of a weaver, some of the 
houses of the merchants were destroyed and the riot was brought to an end by 
means of a compromise imposed upon the weavers by military intervention, which 
caused several fatalities. The region&#8217;s workers suffered from a rise in the 
price of necessities between 1846 and 1847, which led to the deaths of up to 20% 
of the population in certain localities. This riot was the high point of a 
number of still-unknown actions. Clubs and mutual aid and educational 
associations were created, often following the model of groups which already 
existed in other countries as a result of the efforts of emigrant artisans, who 
participated in the social and political life of their new homes. The most 
well-known such group was the German Peoples Society of Paris (1832), which 
became the League of the Exiles, then the League of the Just, from which the 
Communist League later split.<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Marx and Engels frequently insisted on the fact that theory (the 
&#8220;German ideology&#8221;, but also revolutionary theory) had developed so easily in 
Germany because that country offered few avenues for action (liberal or 
proletarian). It could be suggested that the hunger for workers education, which 
characterized England and other European countries, was all the greater in 
Germany due to the limited possibilities for immediate action.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> The Communist 
League was as much an organization for education and recreation as it was an 
organization for politics and theory, and created public workers associations 
for elementary education, publishing, holding debates and cultural gatherings. 
If &#8220;militantism&#8221; is currently criticized for being an activity remote from 
life<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a>, the movement of the mid-19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century had a tendency to 
manifest an all-embracing social activity.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> Finally, the German revolutionary 
movement (like those of Russia and the Netherlands prior to 1914) had an open 
and international character due to its internal weakness and its need for 
inspiration from foreign experiences, both to imitate and to criticize. From its 
inception in 1840-1847, the communist current in Germany had a European 
dimension.</p>

<p class="fst">The liberal bourgeoisie often supported the workers associations, 
about which the Jewish typographer S. Born said: &#8220;We want a club so we can be 
men.&#8221; It was not rare for the municipality to pay the clubs&#8217; lecturers. When 
these associations too plainly declared themselves against the established 
order, the bourgeoisie withdrew their assistance; sometimes they were 
prohibited. This development coincided, around 1844-1845, with growing interest 
in the &#8220;social question&#8221;, as is verified by numerous texts from that time. 
Engels recalled that interest in communism was as common among the bourgeoisie 
as it was among the proletarians, and related that numerous members of the 
liberal professions and even of the bourgeoisie attended lectures on communism. 
Understanding that the creation of wealth through labor engendered the creation 
of misery among the workers, the bourgeoisie tried to prevent the resolution of 
this contradiction from assuming an explosive form, and studied the subversive 
movement and its theoretical expressions in order to take action in regard to 
social conditions. <i>The Essence of Money</i> by M. Hess criticized the 
existence of labor power as a <i>commodity</i>, which had been accepted by Kant 
and Hegel: &#8220;If men could not be sold, they would not be worth even one penny, 
since they have no value unless they sell themselves or put themselves out to 
hire.&#8221;<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> The critique of the world of commodities would be pursued by Marx. It 
is possible that no more than five or ten thousand people effectively 
participated in these &#8220;debates&#8221; and this &#8220;organization&#8221;, but their role would be 
important in the following years. In 1848-1849, <i>The New Rhineland Gazette</i> 
had a print run of 6,000, a considerable number for that era.</p>

<p class="fst">However, even though the barricades of March 1848 forced the 
Prussian army to evacuate Berlin, the April events demonstrated the impotence of 
the workers movement in taking the initiative in a revolution which would 
continue to be bourgeois, and timidly bourgeois. To different degrees, the 
European bourgeoisie preferred during the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century not to 
immediately secure total political power, which it did not assume until 1918 in 
Germany. In April 1848, the two active organizations were Born&#8217;s Central Workers 
Committee and the Committee for Popular Elections, a much broader grouping. In 
the light of later events the failure of 1848 would be interpreted as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;This is how the only occasion offered by the history of the 
working class of the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century for an action in common between 
skilled artisans and a much greater number of more radical and more dispossessed 
men, with the goal of jointly confronting the authority of the state, was not 
taken advantage of.&#8221;<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This historian even went so far as to compare the arrest of 
Schlöffel (a radical student associated with unskilled workers) to the 
assassination of Luxemburg and Liebknecht in January 1919. Born&#8217;s group, 
representing the &#8220;highest layer of the working class&#8221;, was the precursor of the 
SPD: the defeat of the more proletarianized elements, in the sense in which Marx 
employed the term<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a>, coincided with the beginnings of the organization of the 
more privileged and consequently more moderate elements, who appealed especially 
to the State, thus presaging Lassalle (see below). It is clear that the journals 
published later, in 1849, which were associated with Born, publicized the theme 
of production associations supported by public funds.</p>

<p class="fst">After the defeat of April 1848, this movement was incapable of 
promoting the &#8220;dual&#8221; revolution (bourgeois and proletarian) advocated by the 
communists.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a> The armed confrontations in which the workers formed a large 
part of the democratic camp had little chance of victory after the bourgeoisie 
of western Germany yielded to the reaction. This same reaction, however, would 
reassume the reins of the economic program of the bourgeois revolution and would 
carry out capitalist development to the great benefit of the bourgeoisie of the 
Rhineland and Saxony.</p>

<p class="fst">In Dresden, in May 1849, the democrats raised barricades and 
tried to blow up the buildings on either side of them so as not to be caught in 
a pincers movement&#8212;Cavaignac&#8217;s tactic in Paris in June of 1848. But the 
demolition teams failed. Lacking food and water, and not receiving the 
reinforcements which they had expected, the rebels also squandered their chance 
to seize the city&#8217;s artillery and armory. As had been shown to be the case in 
Breslau in 1793, and was further confirmed in Paris in June of 1848, urban 
insurrections were condemned to impotence if they left the use of artillery in 
the hands of the enemy. The Prussian cannons reduced the barricades and the 
rebels, after three or four days of resistance, abandoned the city. Despite the 
aid they received from the peasants during their retreat, they were unable to 
resume the struggle.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> The army of Baden, formed by 25,000 men (both regulars 
and guerrillas) from all over Germany, but primarily from the south and 
southwest, was organized in June under the command of a Polish officer. In its 
ranks were soldiers from Baden, workers from Württemburg and guerrillas. Against 
the Prussians, who had four or five times more soldiers, it was not unified 
enough, and was surrounded in the fortress of Rastatt and capitulated in July. 
The scope of this civil war has probably been exaggerated: throughout all the 
skirmishes of 1848-1849, the Prussian army suffered fewer than 500 
casualties.<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a><sup style="font-size: 80%">-</sup><a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The effects of this defeat on the German and European communist 
movements have been underestimated. The &#8220;lessons&#8221; of the counterrevolution were 
taken into account by the moderates as well as by the revolutionaries. While the 
years 1840-1850 coincided with a critique of private property, the defeat of 
1848-1849 accentuated the tendency to seek improvements within capitalism. The 
old traditions inherited from the guilds had transmitted the experience of 
collective struggle to modern proletarians: the succeeding phase would see the 
initiation of efforts to achieve a community of wage labor within existing 
society with its own defense mechanisms and values recognized by the State.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1848-1850, the Brotherhood (<i>Verbrüderung</i>) led by Born 
counted almost 40,000 members and dedicated its efforts to promoting a 
collectivist system. As Born stated in a letter to Marx in 1848, it was 
necessary to avoid &#8220;futile insurrections&#8221;; the majority of workers must be won 
over and the class must be unified <i>within</i> capital.<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> This reformism was 
obviously condemned to failure. It was unrealistic to want to organize a 
reformism parallel to capitalism in rival units of production (cooperatives). 
This perspective was the craftsman&#8217;s dream of adapting to technological progress 
without destroying capital, thereby preventing artisans from becoming either 
proletarians or small capitalist businessmen. The SPD, with the assistance of 
the trade unions, would on the other hand construct a <i>modern</i> reformism, 
consonant with industrial development, not outside of but within large industry. 
Lassalle appeared to be the point of intersection between the two phases, 
combining labor organization and cooperation.</p>

<p class="fst">In effect, the reaction which followed 1848-1849 was political: 
on the economic plane, it could only survive by adopting the program of its 
adversary (the bourgeoisie). In order to consolidate its hegemony, the 
supposedly feudal Prussian State had to prepare the ground for a capitalist 
development which was the only way to firmly establish German power and to 
reinforce its own political preeminence. But the ambiguity of German unification 
would endure even after 1871, disappearing only in 1918. Economic expansion did 
not, properly speaking, make the artisans dissolve into the ranks of the 
proletariat: artisans were often absorbed into factories where they preserved 
their status as foremen of the labor process which, in its organization and 
specialization, had not yet been totally transformed. The role of skilled 
workers, as well as that of their training (political and professional) was 
progressively marginalized due to migration within Germany or immigration 
overseas. The wages of workers in the rural areas rose. Certain kinds of poverty 
tended to disappear with the absorption of the unemployed and poor artisans by 
industry. The economic crisis of 1857, the first disturbance to simultaneously 
shake England, the United States, France and Germany, did not profoundly affect 
the workers&#8217; standard of living. The Bismarckian approach, a synthesis of 
authority and conciliation to subordinate the workers to capitalism, was already 
in effect. Strikes&#8212;of short duration compared to those in England&#8212;were often 
broken by the old artisan class.</p>

<h3><a name="h3">&#8220;Marxism&#8221; and Lassallism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">For anyone who invokes &#8220;Marxism&#8221;, especially in Germany, Lassalle 
has been a model of detestable &#8220;reformism&#8221; for more than a century. It would 
hardly be an exaggeration to say that the history of the Marxist tradition has 
always presented the Lassallian movement as the evil opposed to the good 
incarnated by Marx&#8217;s supporters in Germany. Undoubtedly imperfect, but 
ultimately revolutionaries, it was men like Liebknecht and A. Bebel who would 
constitute the real socialist movement, as opposed to the traitor Lassalle who 
secretly negotiated with Bismarck. There is, in fact, a great deal of continuity 
between Lassallism and the SPD, although the most foreign aspects of the 
Lassallian movement would be abandoned. Lassalle himself is a complex 
personality. When he died in 1864 as a result of a duel, Heine wrote that he was 
a mixture of great personal qualities and the genius of self-destruction.<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a> 
Transcending the archaic reformism of the artisanal sector, Lassalle 
simultaneously rejected class struggle and Manchester liberalism. His <i>System 
of Acquired Rights</i> develops the theme of the passage from private property 
to public property. He announces the advent of the workers as a (non-subversive) 
social-professional grouping within capitalism, who pressure capitalism (with 
the help of the State) to obtain a stable and recognized status. In an 1862 
speech&#8212;the year Bismarck was appointed Chancellor&#8212;Lassalle posed the question: 
who should run society? Constitutions, he explains, are not so much immutable 
documents as the provisional crystallizations of power relations between rival 
social groups. Aware of the <i>political</i> reality of the capitalist world, 
where the atomization of individuals leads to their regrouping into blocs which 
demand shares of power, he seeks to directly organize this claimed share of 
power in collaboration with Bismarck.<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a> Although his secret correspondence was 
not revealed until after his death, the other socialists never ceased to 
denounce Lassalle&#8217;s collusion with the State. Lassalle describes his 
organization to Bismarck as &#8220;my empire&#8221;: &#8220;The working classes are instinctively 
predisposed in favor of dictatorship, if one knows how to fully convince them 
that this dictatorship is to be exercised in their interest.&#8221;<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a> Lassalle&#8217;s 
adversaries in the workers movement fought in the name of workers autonomy 
against submission to the State. But can one speak of workers autonomy under 
capitalism, which, more than any other social system tends to produce the 
conditions of life in their entirety? Paradoxically, the demand for workers 
independence in opposition to the factory owners drove the ADAV (General 
Association of German Workers) towards the State. The demand for independence in 
opposition to capital would push the SPD towards what appeared to be the means 
to limit capital&#8217;s field of action, that is, to exercise influence over it: once 
again, the State is at hand. Everything which intends to live on the margins of 
capital is finally condemned to seek the protection of that which appears to be 
above capital, but which is nothing but its concentrated power.<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lassalle made an incomplete attempt, sealed by an explicit pact 
(see his letters), to accomplish what social democracy would later realize by 
concluding an implicit agreement with capital. Lassalle was a precursor; for the 
workers, against the bourgeoisie, and with the assistance of the State. In this 
sense, he was also a prefiguration of 1918-1919 and national socialism. 
Lassallism could not succeed because it remained tied to the utopia of the 
cooperatives which were to have constituted a counterweight&#8212;but always with the 
help of the State&#8212;to the industrial power of capital, which was impossible. The 
SPD would strip Lassallism of these absurdities in order to preserve its 
essential nucleus: Lassalle had helped German society to frame the question of 
what place the workers should assume within it.</p>

<p class="fst">Although it was reformist, the ADAV, founded in 1863, faced the 
hostility of the factory owners and the police in (local) social conflicts, 
despite the pact sealed by the Lassalle-Bismarck summit. Since he believed in 
the possibility of establishing production cooperatives, Lassalle could all the 
more easily &#8220;discover&#8221; the theory of the iron law of wages, which holds that 
wages must always decline to a minimum due to the play of economic mechanisms, 
no matter what the organized workers do. This theory allowed him to justify his 
indifference, not to say hostility, to the trade unions. That such a doctrine 
suited his politics is the least that one could say. His successor as leader of 
the ADAV, Schweitzer, followed the same path, but was compelled to recant after 
1868 under pressure from ADAV members and the reform movements. He then 
organized a conference said to represent 140,000 workers, but this number 
rapidly declined and was reduced to 10,000 in 1870.<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Alongside the party linked to Marx and Engels, the Social 
Democratic Workers Party (SDAP), which was founded in 1869, there was the 
offshoot of an organization created in 1863, the League of German Workers Clubs 
(VDA), which from its inception had opposed Lassallism in regard to the question 
of German unification.<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a> The ADAV supported unification under Prussian 
leadership, and could be said to have sold its support to the most powerful 
German state in exchange for a special law concerning labor and some advantages 
within the unified Germany of the future. The SDAP, however, proclaimed its 
support for a democratic unification without Prussian hegemony. The social 
composition of the ADAV was, at least initially, more working class than that of 
the SDAP, which happily directed its message towards the anti-Prussian democrats 
as well as militant workers. The declarations of Bebel and Liebknecht seem to 
grant a place of honor to the resistance against Prussian dominance, even more 
than to the problems of socialism. It cannot be said that the SDAP represented 
the class struggle and Marxism against the class collaboration of the ADAV. The 
SDAP was quite ambiguous, so much so that, until about 1880, support for the 
socialist and workers movement was provided above all by artisans threatened by 
industrialization. The VDA was &#8220;a rather weak federation of local clubs&#8221;, while 
the ADAV was, from its very inception, highly centralized. Two political 
organizations were linked to the VDA: the German Party (1865), a very weak <i>
democratic</i> group, and the Saxon Peoples Party (1866), primarily composed of 
workers. This dualism would persist in the SPD. Marx was much more aware of the 
Lassallian danger than of the distance separating the SDAP from communism. He 
was convinced that the SDAP would evolve in a revolutionary direction; as for 
the ADAV, its large membership led him to provisionally take it into 
consideration before attacking it in earnest. On December 22, 1864, he wrote 
that the ADAV&#8217;s membership in the IWA &#8220;was only necessary as a beginning, in 
order to fight against our enemies here. Later, it will be necessary to 
completely destroy this organization, since the foundations upon which it is 
based are false&#8221;.<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a> After the failure of the new newspaper, the <i>
Sozial-Demokrat</i>, in 1864-1865, the rupture between the IWA and the ADAV was 
consummated: the IWA would thenceforth accept individual memberships only. 
Marx&#8217;s influence in Germany declined to one of its lowest points ever. 
Liebknecht, who lived for twelve years in London, and had been a member of the 
ADAV since 1863, would later break with the Lassallians. In 1900, he would 
justify his activity within the ADAV in the following manner: &#8220;there was a 
movement and an organization within it, albeit embryonic ones.&#8221;<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a> After 1866 
and Prussia&#8217;s victory over Austria, it was clear that unification would be 
achieved under Prussian leadership; especially since Germany&#8217;s southern states 
feared France. Bismarck and the liberals reached an understanding and he granted 
fewer concessions to the ADAV, which then moved towards the left. The SDAP was 
slowly gaining prestige and benefiting from its association with Marx and the 
IWA. Published in 1867, Volume I of <i>Capital</i> was much less influential 
than is generally believed. Its rare readers (Bebel waited two years to read it 
and Liebknecht had read fewer than 15 pages after having received it) accepted 
it as an exaltation of the working class against capital, reading into it the 
&#8220;certainty of victory&#8221;, according to Liebknecht&#8217;s 1868 formula. The socialist 
newspapers which took note of its publication generally only quoted its 
Introduction, without understanding its analyses<a href="#n38" name="fn38" target="_self">[38]</a>. What were discovered in <i>
Capital</i> were not capital&#8217;s laws of motion, its flexibility, or the 
characteristics of communism, but the &#8220;scientific&#8221; proofs of capital&#8217;s 
exploitation of the workers. Only half of its message was absorbed, as if the 
project of theoretical communism was limited to denunciation, and was not the 
unveiling of the communist program. The visionary aspect of revolutionary theory 
was beginning to be forgotten, and was relegated to the supposedly inferior and 
infantile level of &#8220;utopian socialism&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">Similarly, when the SDAP convened its 1869 Congress in Eisenach, 
claiming to embrace 14,000 workers, its program, when subjected to careful 
examination, was by no means &#8220;Marxist&#8221;.<a href="#n39" name="fn39" target="_self">[39]</a> The Lassallian vestiges with which 
it was still impregnated (&#8220;Free Peoples State&#8221;, &#8220;the entire product of labor&#8221;, 
&#8220;public credit for production cooperatives&#8221;) were the same ones which Marx would 
criticize six years later when the Party would fuse with the Lassallians at 
Gotha. It is impossible to oppose &#8220;Lassallism&#8221; to &#8220;Marxism&#8221;, even while 
recognizing that the latter had provisionally capitulated to the former in 1875. 
Its alleged affiliation later betrayed by the SPD never existed. The Eisenach 
Program is, furthermore, fully within the democratic tradition: demands for 
&#8220;political freedom&#8221; and a &#8220;democratic state&#8221;. The influence of the Peoples Party 
was such that one of its leaders, Sonnemann, a left liberal, persuaded Bebel to 
adopt the name &#8220;Socialist Democratic Party&#8221;, thus leaving the word &#8220;worker&#8221; out 
of the party&#8217;s title. When Bebel proposed that the word &#8220;worker&#8221; be included in 
the name of the party he was defeated by the former followers of Lassalle.<a href="#n40" name="fn40" target="_self">[40]</a> 
In this sense, the Lassallians were the purest representatives of a 
specifically, yet limited (see below) working class reformism, in contrast to 
the &#8220;Marxists&#8221; who obtained all their inspiration and their power from the 
democratic movement and from the fear of the liberal bourgeoisie in the 
non-Prussian states of being dominated by Prussia. The SPD would later combine 
Statism and democracy, but this dualism would again be manifested in the 
conflict between an extreme right in favor of State power and a liberal right 
(Bernstein).</p>

<p class="fst">Parliamentary activity soon occupied a preponderant place within 
the new party. Liebknecht, of course, vehemently declared in 1870: &#8220;The 
Reichstag does not make history and is content with performing a comedy; its 
members say and do what the director tells them. Should we, therefore, make the 
Reichstag the center of our activities... ? If revolutionaries were not so inept 
and if the government did not control the elections, it would be possible.&#8221;<a href="#n41" name="fn41" target="_self">[41]</a> 
But he did not reject the principle of parliamentarism and only regretted that 
it played its democratic role so poorly.</p>

<p class="fst">The SDAP was a section of the IWA, but, as Engels wrote to Cuno 
on May 7-8, 1872, &#8220;the attitude of the German workers movement in relation to 
the International has never been very clear. Their relationship has always been 
purely Platonic...&#8221; Between July of 1870 and May of 1871, a minority within the 
Party (Bebel, Liebknecht) maintained relatively internationalist positions. But 
one must take the role played by the national question into consideration as a 
factor of confusion, even in the reflections of Marx and Engels. It is possible 
that the national question often served as a surrogate for deeper reflection 
(and sometimes for action). Exaggerating the role played by Russia in the 
failure of the movements of 1848-1849 allowed them to avoid posing serious 
questions concerning the effective capabilities of the proletarians and 
revolutionaries of their time. Similarly, they counted on German unification to 
help develop the socialist movement<a href="#n42" name="fn42" target="_self">[42]</a>. Conversely, they expected French action 
to undermine political structures: this was true of Liebknecht in regard to the 
Saxon monarchy.<a href="#n43" name="fn43" target="_self">[43]</a></p>

<p class="fst">On July 21, 1870, Liebknecht and Bebel refused to vote for the 
war budget, which had been accepted by the Lassallians and Fritzche, an 
ex-Lassallian who became a member and then a parliamentary deputy of the SDAP. 
But their internationalism was unstable. Liebknecht, at the head of the 
&#8220;Brunswick Committee&#8221;, which was composed primarily of ex-Lassallians, declared 
on July 26: &#8220;I must not blame you too much for your patriotic fervor. But you, 
too, for your part, should make some concessions. Even if you do not agree with 
the position Bebel and I took in the Reichstag, our disagreement must be 
overcome at all costs or, in any event, we must prevent it from coming to the 
attention of the public.&#8221;<a href="#n44" name="fn44" target="_self">[44]</a> Their internationalist position obviously implied 
that they should be clear and stand firm against those who upheld the opposing 
position. The Party&#8217;s unity would not be restored again until after the defeat 
of the French: a French victory could then no longer be feared, and the entire 
&#8220;Marxist&#8221; workers movement could once again join in a demand for a peace without 
annexations (which would also be one of the centrist positions of 1914-1918, 
garnering the support of the majority at Zimmerwald in 1915, and would be 
attacked by the Zimmerwald Left: see Chapter 4).</p>

<p class="fst">Bebel and Liebknecht did not have an international point of view, 
and in this respect they were like everyone else. Their attitude, even when it 
coincided with Marx&#8217;s viewpoint, derived not from international but from 
national considerations. For them, it was a matter of making alliances with 
certain parties and social groups in Germany, but different ones from which the 
Lassallians expected concessions since the latter relied above all on the State. 
Their dissident attitude towards the war was an extension of their policy of 
supporting the liberal bourgeoisie and their hostility towards Prussia. Evoking 
the Commune before the Reichstag in April of 1871, Bebel invited the supporters 
of the Commune to &#8220;act with the greatest moderation&#8221;.<a href="#n45" name="fn45" target="_self">[45]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The SPD would speak of a victory over Lassallism: but which 
elements of Marxism emerged victorious? Above all, the idea of the ultimate 
victory of socialism, and of the need for an independent political workers 
organization. But Lassalle was not opposed to these things. Believing in a final 
victory is not in itself revolutionary: if the tasks of the communist revolution 
are not clarified, the &#8220;transition&#8221; to socialism could appear to be a <i>gradual</i> 
evolution. Lassallism was integrated into the workers movement. In their pure 
form, the specific contributions of Bebel, Liebknecht and Lassalle each 
represented a stereotyped tendency from the beginnings of the movement, and fuse 
when capital distracts the working class. Many signs testify to the persistence 
of Lassallism until the beginning of the 20<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century. One can even 
speak of an official Lassalle cult. Liebknecht, in publishing an article by 
Engels in 1868, deleted the passages critical of Lassalle. In his famous 
pamphlet <i>Our Goals</i> (1870), Bebel makes few allusions to the IWA, but 
often quotes Lassalle and employs his arguments. Marx often complained that the 
Lassallians simultaneously plagiarized and distorted his theories. Marx&#8217;s 
thought was never understood for what it really was. It was always disseminated 
through a filter, that of Lassalle, in an epoch when Marx&#8217;s writings were not 
widely circulated, and later through the official Social Democratic screen. 
Militants&#8217; correspondence testifies, at least until the end of the century, to a 
lack of awareness of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>. In 1872, the cover of a 
Party publication reproduced two photographs, of Marx and Lassalle, flanking 
that of Liebknecht. <i>The History of Social Democracy</i>, a semi-official work 
written by Mehring, a theoretician of the left, is nonetheless as favorable to 
Lassalle as to Marx.<a href="#n46" name="fn46" target="_self">[46]</a> The attack against Lassalle during the 1870s derived 
primarily from the (self-avowed) anti-Marxist Dühring. Lassalle&#8217;s real 
popularity would persist (even outside the Party) until the War: other idols 
would then replace him. It is pure illusion to believe that the polemics of the 
epoch revolved around Marx and were settled in his favor. The progressive 
penetration of theoretical communism is a legend. Upon Liebknecht&#8217;s death 
(1900), it was Bebel who would lead the Party until 1913. His polemics were of 
little importance: above all, he wanted to preserve the organization, that is, 
the one which would prepare the future (ultimately a capitalist future) of 
Social Democracy.<a href="#n47" name="fn47" target="_self">[47]</a> Theory became simply an allusive reference, useful or 
annoying, depending on the circumstances. The Marx-Engels correspondence, 
published in 1913, was carefully abridged by V. Adler, Bernstein and Bebel, with 
particular attention to those passages dealing with Lassalle and Liebknecht, 
whom Marx abused on several occasions.<a href="#n48" name="fn48" target="_self">[48]</a> The movement needed heroes. Mehring 
denounced this maneuver, and published some of the expurgated passages before 
the book&#8217;s release, although he claimed in 1915 that the book had presented the 
essentials of Marx and Engels&#8217; correspondence. Riazanov would later guarantee 
this falsification, but would then regret having done so.</p>

<p class="fst">The SDAP combined with the ADAV in 1875 at the Gotha Congress to 
form the Socialist Workers Party, making many concessions to Lassallism, which 
were severely criticized by Marx. The legend would have it that this deviation 
was to be corrected by the creation, in 1890, of the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany (SPD), whose Marxist Erfurt Program, written by Kautsky, would be the 
proof of revolutionary victory. Of course, Marx expressed vigorous reservations 
concerning the name itself: &#8220;What a name: <i>Sozialdemokrat</i>. Why not frankly 
call it <i>the Proletarian</i>?&#8221;, Engels wrote to Marx on November 16, 1864. 
Marx responded on November 18: &#8220;<i>Sozialdemokrat</i>. A bad name. But it is 
important not to quickly use up all the best names in possible failures.&#8221;<a href="#n49" name="fn49" target="_self">[49]</a> It 
would be more correct to translate this term by <i>social democrat</i>. It 
effectively designated a movement which accepted and reinforced the democratic 
scenario (that is, a political form,<a href="#n50" name="fn50" target="_self">[50]</a> one State form opposed to others, such 
as, for example, dictatorship), in order to imbue it with a social content by 
introducing improvements in working class living conditions. As for the 
terminology expressing essential questions, the choice of the term <i>
Sozialdemokrat</i> made no difference at all, for either the SPD or the most 
advanced fraction of the bourgeoisie, who also proposed solving &#8220;the social 
question&#8221; within the &#8220;democratic framework&#8221;. Following the SPD&#8217;s trajectory from 
1890 to 1933, one notes that the SPD always reproached the liberal bourgeoisie 
for not respecting its own principles, for not going far enough in support of 
democracy, in a word, for not involving the workers in existing society. Words 
are not autonomous, and bear the meaning given them by whoever uses them. Those 
who formed the Communist League wanted to use this term to insist upon the 
nature of the movement of which they were a part: a movement for the collective 
use and enjoyment of wealth. Babeuf spoke of &#8220;the common happiness&#8221;. Social 
democracy designates no more than a reorganization, a realignment of private 
property within society, a socialization of the wealth hitherto distributed 
between the State and Business by means of an equitable distribution of power in 
favor of all social groups: adding equality to freedom, real rights to formal 
liberties, a social content to political democracy, a step forward in the 
destiny of the workers towards universal suffrage: this is the real program of 
the SPD. The general political goals defined at Erfurt differed little from 
those at Gotha. The evolution of the German workers movement up to 1918 consists 
of the difficult rupture of an unnatural (from the revolutionary point of view) 
but historically inevitable alliance between reformism and the communist 
movement. But the road taken in common is more than just a simple journey. It 
profoundly affected the revolutionaries and created an anti-revolutionary 
organization anchored in reality and supported by the majority of the workers. 
The opposition movements which arose were ambiguous and did not question, unlike 
what took place in other countries and even in Germany before the war, the 
function of Social Democracy itself. The German Left was relatively late in 
forming, considering the importance of this country (see Chapter 1): once 
constituted, it would not, as elsewhere, go very far.</p>

<p class="fst">After Erfurt, the &#8220;<i>Jungen</i>&#8221; (Youth) group hit the nail on 
the head with their critiques of the Party&#8217;s reformist character and its 
acceptance of official institutions (parliament). Their critiques were too much 
like those of the anarchists for Engels to refrain from being one of their most 
vehement opponents. He nonetheless took little notice of the kernel of truth 
which they contained. In reality, &#8220;anarchism&#8221;, just like &#8220;Marxism&#8221;, did not 
exist as an organized and unified current. A prisoner of its time, it embraced a 
series of reactions to the capitalist stagnation of the Second International. 
Anarchism is one of the great architects of the construction of the modern trade 
union movement after the end of the 1800s: the trade unionism which anarchism 
inspired would prove to be as non-revolutionary as that of the &#8220;Marxists&#8221; (see 
Chapter 9). Only a minority with a Marxist background (including the German 
Left) would prove to be capable of trying to derive a perspective for the future 
after 1914.</p>

<p class="fst">Engels harbored vast illusions when he wrote to Lafargue on June 
11, 1869: &#8220;Now that we have won, we have proved to the world that almost all 
European socialists are Marxists.&#8221;<a href="#n51" name="fn51" target="_self">[51]</a> The following year, the English, Belgian 
and German socialists were tempted to attend the congress of the Possibilists 
(with P. Brousse, supporters of achieving what is possible within capitalism). 
Engels went so far as to recommend unity at any price, convinced that such a 
development would by itself eliminate opportunism (see his letter of August 9, 
1890).<a href="#n52" name="fn52" target="_self">[52]</a> This is why he scorned the <i>&#8220;Jungen&#8221;</i>.<a href="#n53" name="fn53" target="_self">[53]</a> For Marx and Engels, 
parties like the SPD, despite their deficiencies, represented the &#8220;real&#8221; workers 
movement, as opposed to the anarchist groups whom they compared to religious 
sects. This is why they both accepted parliamentary action without exposing its 
effects.</p>

<p class="fst">Engels mistakenly assimilated universal suffrage with the &#8220;index 
which allows one to measure the maturity of the working class. It can only be 
that, and will never be anything but that in today&#8217;s State&#8221;.<a href="#n54" name="fn54" target="_self">[54]</a> The 
representative system is much more than that and as capital blocks any other 
kind of community not derived from the capital relation it becomes 
correspondingly more important. Elections and political life become one of the 
privileged sites in which one rediscovers a sense of community. Parliamentarism 
is not merely a &#8220;barometer of class struggle&#8221;: it does not limit itself to 
measuring, it deforms what it measures, and itself intervenes with all of its 
weight in the &#8220;class struggle&#8221; in order to bring the latter to an end. It is not 
enough to say that parliamentarism was not revolutionary <i>after</i> 1914<a href="#n55" name="fn55" target="_self">[55]</a>: 
one must also see its nefarious role even before 1914, and admit that Marx, 
Engels and after them almost the entire left wing of the Second International 
did not take this into account.</p>

<p class="fst">Engels&#8217; tactic also rests upon the idea that universal suffrage 
would not be easily granted in Prussia, where the workers movement was barely 
tolerated.<a href="#n56" name="fn56" target="_self">[56]</a> Thus, one could do revolutionary work even on the parliamentary 
terrain, since Prussia was opposed to democracy. This view underestimated the 
ability of capitalist society to become democratic, and to keep the workers on 
this terrain to the detriment of the proletarian social movement. The policy of 
the Prussian State in regards to the workers movement was not distinguished by a 
confused rejection of toleration, but by <i>integration</i>, which had begun 
with Lassalle.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">Reformism and the Radical Response prior to 1914</a></h3>

<p class="fst">It would be an excessive distortion of the facts to consider the 
SPD&#8217;s evolution until the end of the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century from the 
perspective of the &#8220;revisionist&#8221; dispute which began around 1890 involving 
Bernstein, the only honest reformist, or Vollmar, the Bavarian socialist. The 
latter, a militant in a largely agricultural, only slightly industrialized 
region, advocated doctrinal softening and flexibility in electoral tactics in 
order not to alienate the peasants and middle classes. This was not the more 
important sort of revisionism from the capitalist point of view. In reality, the 
most dangerous reformism (for the revolution) came from the workers (trade 
union) leaders in the large industrial regions. These leaders applied the second 
(reformist) part of the Erfurt Program, abandoning the measures enumerated in 
the first part which can be summarized as follows: capitalist socialization of 
wealth and production. This Program did not say that the privileged agent of 
this evolution would be the State, but neither was anything clearly stated on 
this topic, so the road was still open. Lassallian Statism again comes to the 
fore, not to develop cooperatives, but to assure society&#8217;s democratization. 
Since the years when Bismarck prohibited the socialist party, from 1880-1890, a 
system of social services was established which would link the workers to the 
State. Weimar would later systematically develop a mixed economy (associating 
State and private capital) advocated by the ADGB and the SPD, the logical 
outcome of the socialization defined&#8212;or, which is the same thing, badly 
defined&#8212;at Erfurt.</p>

<p class="fst">At first, from about 1869 to 1890, the trade unions were a means 
of recruitment for the Party, which was illegal from 1872 to 1890. After 1890, 
the political and trade union organizations enjoyed a situation of independent 
coexistence. In 1906, the trade unions imposed their right to veto any important 
decision of the SPD.<a href="#n57" name="fn57" target="_self">[57]</a> But their mutual evolution did not proceed without 
problems. Radical elements often dominated local trade union coordinating bodies 
and local sections. The latter, comparable to the departmental unions of the 
French CGT, frequently opposed the emergence of a layer of permanent salaried 
officials, which took place wherever trade unions existed. The radicals 
denounced tendencies towards conciliation, and opposed collective bargaining. In 
1896, a local section of the Leipzig printers union was excluded from its 
chapter for having signed a collective labor contract. The dispute was brought 
before the trade union congress, which pronounced in favor of collective 
bargaining agreements, and excluded the Leipzig central from the national trade 
union. At the same time, centralization&#8212;an indispensable means of struggle in 
negotiations over labor power&#8212;deprived the local centrals of their means of 
action and pressure, especially financial ones. Trade union structure lagged 
behind industrial development. In Hamburg, while industrial trade unions 
embraced more than 40% of the ADGB&#8217;s members, only 9 out of 52 local union 
leaders came from these unions, which had almost no managerial positions.<a href="#n58" name="fn58" target="_self">[58]</a> 
The ADGB hesitated to form industrial federations, preferring instead to group 
trade unions together locally or regionally by trade.</p>

<p class="fst">The growth of the trade unions, which combined, in 1892, in the 
General Trade Union Commission, and later in the ADGB in 1900, was accompanied 
by a growing rivalry with the SPD. Like the Bavarians, the trade unions found 
the revolutionary <i>ideology</i> of the Party to be an obstacle to their 
growth. The Party, on the other hand, needed this ideology to win over those 
elements which more or less aspired to social change, as well as to preserve its 
left wing. The trade unions supported the &#8220;revisionists&#8221; (who loudly proclaimed 
what the Party was actually doing), and the &#8220;orthodox&#8221; leaders forged a 
revolutionary image at little expense, appearing to be defenders of the 
revolutionary tradition. There was a struggle between these two organizations, 
whose interests were not convergent: this disagreement would reappear in the 
Weimar republic and last until just after the Nazi seizure of power.<a href="#n59" name="fn59" target="_self">[59]</a> The 
interest of the trade unions was to <i>accept</i> any political regime which 
would guarantee their role as mediators. The Party&#8217;s interest was to <i>modify</i> 
the political system by promoting a type of State in which it could have a 
place. These two perspectives and the respective interests of the two 
bureaucratic layers which defended them frequently converged, but not always. 
The theory of the &#8220;two pillars&#8221; (trade union and Party) which constituted the 
workers movement only served to conceal a struggle for influence.</p>

<p class="fst">The bureaucratization of the Party was also accompanied by a 
certain amount of resistance and only really got underway after 1900.<a href="#n60" name="fn60" target="_self">[60]</a> The 
most numerous permanent officials were not in the Party, but in its satellite 
organizations: in 1914, there were 4,100 permanent officials in the SPD and the 
ADGB, but in 1912 there were 7,100 in workers cooperatives. The organization had 
to be organized: to sustain workers activities, certain commercial enterprises 
were necessary. Auer had said, in 1890: &#8220;the Party cannot live on dues; we need 
to make profits from our Press.&#8221;<a href="#n61" name="fn61" target="_self">[61]</a> A Saxon delegate to the 1894 Congress 
denounced the capitalist nature of the Party: &#8220;There are enterprises which 
employ between 50 and 100 workers. When these workers wanted to take the First 
of May off from work, the social democratic management, among whom were various 
orators who spoke at the rallies on the First of May, docked their pay.&#8221;<a href="#n62" name="fn62" target="_self">[62]</a> The 
Party had to be profitable.</p>

<p class="fst">One of the reasons adduced by the German Left in favor of a 
purely working class organization was the enormous weight acquired within the 
SPD by certain rural groups or small cities which played a role in the Party 
which was totally disproportionate to their real importance.<a href="#n63" name="fn63" target="_self">[63]</a> The middle 
classes of medium-sized and even some small cities were over-represented within 
the Party&#8217;s organizational apparatus and its leadership. In 1912, at the Party&#8217;s 
Congress in the State of Württemberg, 17,000 socialist residents of the city 
were represented by 90 delegates; 5,000 socialists who lived outside the city 
sent 224 delegates. The German Left would also incorporate a reaction&#8212;a healthy 
one but one which often missed the point&#8212;against the sociological weight of 
non-proletarian social layers. The fear of the peasants, expressed theoretically 
by Gorter in numerous works, also expressed the desire of the revolutionary 
movement in the large urban centers to not be drowned out by concessions made by 
the socialists to those who lived in an environment which was less polarized 
around opposed interests. Nonetheless, numbers do not constitute a criterion for 
radical expression and autonomy: in the large organizations, in which the many 
degrees of officialdom between the rank and file and the leadership are most 
varied, the influence of the militants on the leaders was more limited.<a href="#n64" name="fn64" target="_self">[64]</a></p>

<p class="fst">&#8220;National Socialism&#8221; was progressively confirmed as the dominant 
characteristic of the SPD. Concerning Russia, Marx&#8217;s legacy was distorted, 
having been reduced to a mixture of pacifist internationalism and Russophobia, 
together with the concept of popular militias. This characteristic would come to 
be found in the weakness of Karl Liebknecht&#8217;s (W. Liebknecht&#8217;s son) 
anti-militarist activity before and during the war. Father and son were both 
victims of militarism, the former sometimes yielding to it, the latter believing 
that one could be victorious by <i>concentrating</i> on it. It was incorrect to 
maintain that militarism was &#8220;the principle support of capitalism&#8221;.<a href="#n65" name="fn65" target="_self">[65]</a> Radical 
anti-militarism is revolutionary but it does not positively frame the question. 
It understood that the army was among the principle enemies of the revolution, 
without seeing the social tasks of the revolution which are also indispensable 
means of struggle against the army. These overlooked connections would be put to 
the test in January 1919 (see Chapter 7).</p>

<p class="fst">The socialist leaders severely condemned the anti-militarism of 
some SPD members, thereby revealing their patriotism. W. Liebknecht, in a debate 
with D. Nieuwenhuis in Zurich in 1893 (see Chapter 3), denied that one could 
&#8220;fight against the Moloch of militarism by convincing isolated individuals, 
provoking puerile uprisings in the barracks ... which is false, but tirelessly 
advocated. We must establish our doctrine in the army. When the masses become 
socialists, then the time of militarism will have come to an end (prolonged 
applause)&#8221;.<a href="#n66" name="fn66" target="_self">[66]</a> To the false &#8220;anarchist&#8221; radicalism then advocated by G. Hervé, 
he opposed a gradualism which retained nothing of &#8220;Marxism&#8221; but what he found 
useful, along with, among other things, a partial critique of anarchism. An 
in-depth critique would have presupposed the <i>self</i>-critique of &#8220;Marxism&#8221; 
and the recognition of its <i>crisis</i>. At the 1906 Mannheim Congress, Bebel 
addressed the issue of Belgian anti-militarism: &#8220;An insignificant country, whose 
army cannot compare with Prussian military organization. The same thing is 
happening in France. Anti-militarism is spreading there, after only two years 
(Karl Liebknecht interrupts him: they have done quite well!) ... No! That is 
overly-biased and exaggerated! (Vigorous applause).&#8221; Bebel went on to describe 
the anticipated &#8220;fever which would seize control of the masses&#8221; in case of war, 
excluding any possibility of revolutionary action in such circumstances. In 
1907, he defended the popular militia as the best means to defend the country, 
citing, in defense of his position, the opinions of certain generals. Militias 
are excellent for the youth; they evoke the Japanese schools for martial arts, 
in which &#8220;young people contend with so much ardor and courage ... that all of 
Europe should adopt this athletic training regime for the defenders of 
empire&#8221;.<a href="#n67" name="fn67" target="_self">[67]</a> The SPD thus proposed total mobilization and enlistment of youth: 
&#8220;fascism&#8221; would realize these goals. Noske declared that the social democrats 
would defend Germany &#8220;with as much determination as any of the gentlemen 
occupying benches on the right of the Assembly,&#8221; as long as reforms are conceded 
to them.<a href="#n68" name="fn68" target="_self">[68]</a> The pact is clear.</p>

<p class="fst">The socialist youth movement was one of the focal points of 
opposition. It was not a creation of the Party. Groups of young people formed 
around 1904-1906, sometimes with the assistance of Party members. Berlin 
apprentices organized against their masters and thus constituted the nucleus, 
and the movement later spread to other northern cities. Persecuted by the 
police, they had 4,000 members in 1907. The social democratic youth in Northern 
Germany, organized in the Union of Free Youth Organizations, were undoubtedly 
the first groups to experience clandestinity in the 20<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century, at 
a time when the whole socialist movement was tolerated and even admired by 
capital. The social democratic youth experienced something of the spirit of the 
socialist movement which had been persecuted until approximately 1890, and this 
experience would prove useful. In the south the opposition groups were more 
working class, more democratic, and less radical, but still anti-militarist, 
having been influenced by, among other groups, the Young Belgian Guards, which 
arose after 1905. C. Zetkin, a teacher, elaborated a concept of education which 
was a synthesis of Marxism and the new educational methods. Responding to 
pressure from the trade unions, the SPD began to take control of the youth 
groups between 1906 and 1908.</p>

<p class="fst">From their inception, it was perceived that the great mass 
movements of 1905 in Poland and Russia presented a new means of action, a new 
method of agitation, and a new form for an old content. It was still a question, 
even for the left, of exerting pressure on the State but not of destroying it 
(see Chapter 3). The majority supported the parliamentary weapon; the minority 
preferred the extra-parliamentary weapon. &#8220;Mass action&#8221; and &#8220;mass strike&#8221; do not 
correspond to the revolutionary syndicalist thesis of the expropriatory &#8220;general 
strike&#8221; which was conceived in the first place as a rehearsal for the revolution 
and later as the form of the revolution itself, with the trade unions taking 
over production. Mass action is not essentially revolutionary. It could be a 
means of reformist pressure in a country where parliamentary pressure is not 
possible because parliamentary democracy does not yet exist. The &#8220;general 
strike&#8221; is a kind of economically organized mass action without a political 
party. For Luxemburg, the &#8220;mass strike&#8221; is mass action outside of traditional 
(economic and political) organizations, which compels the latter to take action. 
For the center (Kautsky), mass action is a self-generated adaptation of the 
movement at the peak of its struggles, and not a means of radical action. The 
mass strike had already been utilized in Belgium and Austria to obtain universal 
suffrage, just as mass demonstrations would later be used, in Germany in 1918, 
to obtain parliamentary democracy. The Luxemburgist left would privilege the 
dynamic relation of masses-party (the one influencing the other) and the working 
class-State relation (in which the working class is the sum of the relation, 
mass + party), above the destruction of the State, without providing a clear 
definition of the Party.</p>

<p class="fst">After the Hamburg Congress (1908), the Left supported the youth 
movement and in turn received important assistance from the youth movement. The 
position of the youth in the Party became a touchstone of the conflict between 
revisionists and radicals. In almost every place where a youth group existed, 
the Party section took its side against the central Party apparatus. As in the 
question of war, everything ended in compromise. The authority over the youth 
groups conceded to the local sections allowed the youth groups to pursue their 
radicalism wherever the sections favored them, even when the Party machine led 
by Ebert undertook to control them. After 1911 the movement ebbed due to the 
actions of the State, only to be reborn later during the war.</p>

<p class="fst">Behind the surface appearance of adhering to principles, the 
right&#8212;rather than the leadership of the Party&#8212;controlled the Party. The SPD 
added some pseudo-radical declarations of principle to the programs of action 
proposed or imposed by the trade unions. The &#8220;Party&#8221; structure was not the sole 
cause of the SPD&#8217;s degeneration, which was promoted by the trade unions. The 
center backed the right and made use of the left for doctrinal support (without 
any impact on the policies it pursued), even referring to the left in its 
anti-revisionist struggle. The existence of revolutionary tendencies within an 
utterly reformist organization is not in itself a positive sign. These 
tendencies served to provide the organization with a dynamic and credibility for 
radical working class groups and in those situations where revolutionary <i>
ideology</i> was necessary. As long as they did not break with the organization, 
and as long as they did not understand that they did not have to conquer or 
submit to the organization, but to destroy it, these revolutionary tendencies 
strengthened the organization. Korsch would later write that Luxemburg (and, 
elsewhere in the Second International, Lenin) only attacked the <i>theory</i> 
but not the practice of social democracy, thus strengthening it contrary to her 
own intentions.<a href="#n69" name="fn69" target="_self">[69]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1908 the Party&#8217;s school, created in 1905 to train 
functionaries for the SPD and the ADGB, became the target of revisionist attacks 
(by Eisner, among others), but continued to be dominated by the Left (Luxemburg, 
Mehring). Its function was ambiguous. On the one hand, it preserved a tradition 
of revolutionary theory and thus prepared for the future. On the other hand, it 
preserved the idea of a party which was still concerned with revolutionary 
theory. As for the trade unions, they settled the matter by sending no more 
students to the Party&#8217;s school.</p>

<p class="fst">In a letter to Kautsky dated November 8, 1884, Engels linked the 
radical German workers movement to the youth and to the backwardness of German 
capitalism: &#8220;It is curious, that what is of most help to our cause is Germany&#8217;s 
industrial backwardness. In England and France, the transition to 
industrialization is almost over. The living conditions of the proletariat have 
already been stabilized.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This situation was reversed by the rise of German capitalism: 
&#8220;the golden chain to which the capitalist has bound wage labor and which it 
never ceases to forge, has now grown long enough to allow for a relaxation of 
some of its tension.&#8221;<a href="#n70" name="fn70" target="_self">[70]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The theme of the integration of the workers movement into 
established society was debated for the first time during this epoch: after 
1918, people would speak of &#8220;bourgeoisification&#8221; and &#8220;ossification&#8221;. Max Weber 
attributed this trend to &#8220;the growing number of people who have an interest in 
this kind of social promotion and its material advantages.&#8221; &#8220;One could ask who 
has more to lose by it: bourgeois society or social democracy? In my opinion, I 
believe that social democracy has more to lose, and more particularly those 
among its adherents who are the bearers of revolutionary ideology.&#8221; He viewed 
social democracy as &#8220;a State within a State&#8221;.<a href="#n71" name="fn71" target="_self">[71]</a> In 1918, M. Weber would render 
homage to the qualities of order and discipline which the German people, drilled 
by social democracy, could exhibit, as his own experience with a local workers 
and soldiers council demonstrated. R. Michels, who abandoned social democracy 
for revolutionary syndicalism, denounced the SPD&#8217;s bureaucratization:<a href="#n72" name="fn72" target="_self">[72]</a> for 
some workers the labor bureaucracy constituted the social promotion which the 
church at one time offered certain peasants. Weber lamented that the bourgeoisie 
preserved the revolutionary forces within the workers movement due to its 
refusal to concede full freedom of activity (particularly by way of universal 
suffrage) to social democracy: one would then see, he said, how it is not social 
democracy which will conquer the State, but that it will be the State which will 
conquer social democracy.</p>

<p class="fst">The bureaucratic centralization of the SPD gave rise at times to 
a vigorous reaction, above all in the urban centers where tendencies developed 
in opposition to the leadership. In opposition to reformism it was anti-Statist; 
in opposition to the suffocation of internal democracy it wanted a completely 
democratic party structure. Kautsky condemned &#8220;the rebel&#8217;s impatience&#8221; which, 
according to him, inspired the excessive radicalism of 1907.<a href="#n73" name="fn73" target="_self">[73]</a> The left 
gradually exposed the center, attacking its opportunism, for example, at the 
Chemnitz Congress of 1912. But the Party&#8217;s evolution was quite coherent. It was 
the Left which could be accused of opportunism for struggling each day against 
reformism without attacking it in its continuity and its profound logic. One of 
the reasons why the Left failed to clarify this point was an insufficient 
understanding of the crisis-revolution relation. Convinced that a war was 
imminent, it expected the war would bring about a mass uprising. At the end of 
the war, the Left would expect, this time as a result of the political and 
social crisis engendered by the war, a revolution which it would still 
improvidently conceive of as an automatic development. Luxemburg had often set 
out her concept of organization as an irresistible flood: in a letter dated 
February 17, 1904 to H. Roland-Holst she stated that opportunism thrives in 
&#8220;stagnant waters&#8221; and dies &#8220;all by itself&#8221; in a current.<a href="#n74" name="fn74" target="_self">[74]</a> The idea of the 
crisis of capitalism facilitated the avoidance of a serious investigation of 
questions concerning the critical situation of the working class in modern 
capitalism, particularly in relation to the function of the organized workers 
movement. Instead of relying on the shock of a serious disturbance (war, 
crisis), it was necessary to begin by breaking with their own organization. Levi 
was right, in 1930, when he said that after 1903 there was no radical presence, 
outside of &#8220;a tiny sect&#8221;, which could maintain theoretical coherence and assist 
in the reconstruction of a communist organization.<a href="#n75" name="fn75" target="_self">[75]</a> Judging that the 
imperialist phase ruled out the satisfaction of reforms which had previously 
been possible, the Left also tended to ignore the considerable role played by 
reforms conceded to one part of the working class.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1913, a strike of shipyard workers in Hamburg, which was not 
supported by the trade unions, was met by a lockout and ended in defeat; more 
than 1,000 workers were dismissed. The rank and file was very much opposed to 
its leaders. The metal workers trade union petitioned for decision-making 
autonomy and control of the union funds by the regional offices.<a href="#n76" name="fn76" target="_self">[76]</a> Once again, 
the same demand for democratic organizations crops up, which would facilitate 
the rapid growth of revolutionary syndicalism as well as the USPD after 1918 
(see Chapters IV and IX). The theoretical and organizational weakness of the 
Left favored the focusing of discontent on partial goals capable of being 
integrated by the renovated classical workers movement. On the eve of 1914, 
Party and trade union leaders were aware of the malaise which threatened their 
organizations. They knew that there was a rejection of the traditional 
structures and a tendency towards spontaneous and local actions. The rank and 
file distrusted both the central apparatus as well as large movements 
coordinated from above, whose meaning they did not understand. Their retreat to 
localism was a half-answer to the problem, and this tendency, which was further 
stimulated by the war and the post-1918 struggles, was to have the gravest 
consequences.</p>

<p class="fst">The trade unions occasionally had to yield in order to maintain 
their rule over their organizations. This was an era of trade union splits and a 
kind of nostalgic longing for the epoch when the movement had not yet been 
centralized. In the textile, metal working and painting trades, local trade 
unions arose which deliberately emphasized workers <i>autonomy</i>.<a href="#n77" name="fn77" target="_self">[77]</a> The 
&#8220;shop stewards&#8221; who made their appearance during the war, were a new form of 
this workers autonomy (see Chapter 4). The SPD excluded those of its members who 
participated in these trade unions. The &#8220;<i>Jungen</i>&#8221;, whom the Party had 
striven to keep apolitical by means of recreational activities, also clashed 
with their Party guardians. A kind of nostalgia was born among the leading 
circles of the Party. The Party found itself between two phases, after the 
construction and before the management of the State. The Jena Congress (1913) 
prefigured the &#8220;Community of Labor&#8221; created in 1916 by the centrist opposition 
in the Party&#8217;s leadership (see Chapter 4).</p>

<p class="fst">The image of the workers movement on the eve of the war was a 
study in contrasts. In Hamburg, Bebel&#8217;s home city, the model of socialist 
organization in Germany, the trade unions of skilled workers were predominant, 
although the local organizations exercised considerable influence, and a 
minority launched &#8220;unofficial&#8221; strikes. The trade union opposition was 
especially active among longshoremen and in the transport industry. Everyone who 
could not find work elsewhere came to the port for jobs.<a href="#n78" name="fn78" target="_self">[78]</a> Even before 1914 a 
minority knew quite well that they could expect nothing from the trade union 
offices. Their reaction would prove to be one of the hallmarks of the post-1918 
movement, prolonging the already long-standing antagonism between the socialist 
left and the trade unions. In Saxony (an industrial region as important as the 
Ruhr or Upper Silesia), the army intervened in a 1910 strike in the Mansfield 
mining region. The Halle district was dominated by the SPD left since 1913: it 
was to be excluded in 1916.<a href="#n79" name="fn79" target="_self">[79]</a> If the SPD and the ADGB represented powerful 
conservative forces, it is nonetheless possible that they underestimated the 
fissures which appeared in their organizations prior to 1914 and which issued, 
unfortunately, not in a revolutionary movement fully capable of overthrowing the 
classical organs of the workers movement, but in some very small and 
disorganized intermediate groups.</p>
