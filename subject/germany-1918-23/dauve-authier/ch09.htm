<p class="fst">Marx&#8217;s analysis of trade unions in the <i>Manifesto</i> and <i>
Wages, Price and Profit</i>,<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> dating from the second half of the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> 
century, is no longer applicable. Workers struggles, with their victories or 
defeats, no longer have the sole objective of consolidating labor unity, but are 
also intended to strengthen the trade union as a reactionary organization. The 
German Left would be compelled to understand this, while other revolutionaries 
(among others, Bordiga, despite his visionary traits) would want to <i>
reconstruct</i> the old movement. Others would later be tempted by the idea of 
forming broad-based, democratic workers organizations, which would be based on 
rank and file workers organizations.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> At the end of his life, Pannekoek&#8217;s 
achievement would reside in the fact that he understood, despite his councilist 
and educationalist illusions, that revolutionaries would never be able to 
recreate the old movement:<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> like Bordiga, Pannekoek is also profoundly 
contradictory. It is not the reformist <i>organizations</i> which oppose the 
revolution: it is <i>reformism</i> itself which drives the proletarians away 
from the revolution.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">Revolutionary Syndicalism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The rupture (in the USA and other countries) between the official 
socialist movement and a more leftist movement with a Marxist orientation, as 
was the case in the split between the reformist <i>Socialist Party of America</i> 
and DeLeon&#8217;s <i>Socialist Labor Party</i>, was characteristic of a period when 
the proletariat was incapable of unity. The alternative was between obtaining 
reforms and &#8220;preparing&#8221; for the revolution: in the first case, there was 
integration into capital; in the second, a break with the real practice of the 
workers. This explains why the <i>syndicalist</i> perspective was the only one 
which thrived: it established the unity of immediate struggles and revolution. 
For the syndicalist perspective there is continuity between: 1) the immediate 
struggle, with trade union organization (by trade or, like the IWW, by 
industry); 2) the revolution, with the industrial organizations taking power; 3) 
socialism, with a social organization on this basis. Such an illusion has the 
merit of being coherent. The groups (DeLeon) which tried to unite with these 
syndicalists in order to penetrate the working class failed, because, by 
definition, this form of action rejected any kind of structure which was not 
formed &#8220;by the workers themselves&#8221; at the point of production.</p>

<p class="fst">The &#8220;syndicalists&#8221; were divided into two major currents. The 
first was a survival from the 19<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> century workers movement and of 
the &#8220;workers separatism&#8221;<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> which rejected both the communist movement and 
capitalism for the same reason, preferring instead to deal with the labor 
question in its own way, in terms of its exclusively worker-based organization. 
It was connected to the Proudhonist tradition, which was not so much an 
ideological tendency as it was a theorization of workers aspirations; its 
contemporary analogue is the politics of self-management.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> This current, which 
was predominant in the early days of the CGT, entered into crisis after 1906 
(when the general strike for the eight-hour day failed) due to the expanding 
industrialization which liquidated its base in trade- and skill-based 
organizations. French revolutionary syndicalism never underwent a factional 
struggle between moderates and radicals: the revolutionary tendency, by virtue 
of its own development, was transformed in a reformist direction. In 1914, there 
was no surprise: &#8220;For several years, Griffuelhes, Pouget and Merrheim had 
discouraged antipatriotic action.&#8221;<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The second current was much more modern and was inseparable 
from large industry. The IWW was the organization of the unskilled, Taylorized 
labor and the unemployed. This organization did not decay like the CGT, but was 
destroyed as an active movement. The trade unions of the CIO would come to 
occupy the positions which the IWW could not, because, as a hybrid movement, the 
IWW simultaneously wanted revolutionary action and an organization of all wage 
workers on an economic basis. The shop stewards,<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> on the other hand, were the 
organizations of workers delegates, often skilled, whose trade unions had not 
defended their privileges during the war. They often used original means in 
organizing to obtain the satisfaction of their demands, but their struggle was 
not revolutionary. Rather than preventing an autonomous organization of the 
workers against capital, they filled a vacuum abandoned by the trade unions.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> 
Germany combined the first and second currents of revolutionary syndicalism in 
an original synthesis, which would be adapted to events under pressure from the 
workers, and this development would be accentuated as the positions of the SPD 
and the ADGB drove the workers towards more leftist organizations.</p>

<p class="fst">The drift towards the more radical groups (USPD, KPD, 
syndicalists) would create a new conception of organization: unionism. At the 
beginning of 1919, the metal workers union, which, with 1,240,000 members and 
comprising 1/5 of all organized workers, was the leading German trade union, 
elected new leaders sympathetic to the USPD. During the war, its minority had 
already voted for a proposal, which was defeated by 77 votes to 44, to withhold 
its dues from the ADGB, whose patriotism it denounced.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a> The Mannheim Accord of 
1906 (cf. Chapter 2) had expired. But the ADGB responded by getting rid of its 
opponents: it would reintegrate the <i>RO</i> opposition and exclude the 
communists. In Halle, for example, where almost all the trade unions were led by 
communists, the local trade union committee fused with the council organization 
at the beginning of 1921; the ADGB immediately provoked a trade union split.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> 
In 1919, however, the KPD&#8217;s lack of a precise position on the trade union 
question at its founding congress led to an absence of relations between 
communists and trade union organs during the first half of the year, although 
the situation varied from region to region. &#8220;In Hamburg and Bremen, the 
communists attacked Legien&#8217;s trade union offices, seized their funds and 
distributed them to unemployed workers; the workers did not so much as lift a 
finger in defense of &#8216;their&#8217; organization. The conference of the northern German 
sections of the KPD (August 1919) ruled that the members of the KPD must leave 
the ADGB.&#8221;<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> It was only at the end of 1919, and thus after a series of 
defeats, that the purged KPD would adopt the orientation of conquering the trade 
unions, in which the USPD &#8220;had already conquered the leadership position in the 
legal trade union opposition&#8221;.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> Not much was accomplished in this regard, and 
the (right wing) KPD was not in touch with the spontaneous tendencies of the 
workers.</p>

<p class="fst">As often happened, once the revolution was over, the workers 
joined the most radical organizations which were, or appeared to be, correct, or 
created new ones, which slowly became counterrevolutionary if they survived into 
a prolonged period of &#8220;calm&#8221;. The rupture took place between a pre-existing 
tendency from before the revolution and the other, more recently produced 
tendency, which could not survive after the revolutionary defeat. The same 
process would take place in the communist party.</p>

<p class="fst">The FVDG broke the radical front by opposing the renovation of 
the General Union of Miners, destroyed in May 1919, and turned to the creation 
of an organization on the principles of revolutionary syndicalism in the 
Rhineland-Westphalia region, where it was strongest: the <i>Freie Arbeiter Union 
(Rhineland-Westphalia) (Free Workers Union)</i> was founded at the Düsseldorf 
Congress on September 15-16, 1919. The very name, FAU, was a compromise between 
anarchism (<i>Freie</i>: free) and unionism (<i>Union</i>). Indeed, besides the 
members of the post-November 1918 reconstituted FVDG, local unionist 
organizations sympathetic to the KPD also attended the congress (the Essen AAU, 
the General Union of Miners). The opposition of the two tendencies was clearly 
defined: the syndicalists appeared as &#8220;dogmatists&#8221; who wanted their 1906 program 
to be adopted. At that point, the differences revolved around organization by 
trade, an article of faith for classical revolutionary syndicalists, or by 
factory. A compromise was reached: in theory, organization by trades was 
adopted, but in practice the organization was based on what actually existed 
(organization of miners by shafts, and the others by factories). All political 
parties were condemned except the KPD. The FAU (R-W) would remain a coalition of 
organizations until the creation of the FAUD and the AAU.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The FAUD was founded at the XIIth Congress of the FVDG in 
December 1919. This new name reflected the adherence of the various locals of 
the FAU, born since May, to the FVDG: the FAU of Rhineland-Westphalia, discussed 
above, was by far the most important. The organization had spread throughout 
Germany (FAUD, D: <i>Deutschlands</i>) and must have had approximately 200,000 
members at the time. The left unionist opposition was weaker at that time and 
the FAUD returned to classical anarchosyndicalism, under the influence of 
Kropotkin, filtered through R. Rocker, the ideologist of the movement. It called 
itself the FAUD(S) to distinguish itself (S: Syndicalist). It broke with all 
political parties, declared itself against the dictatorship of the proletariat, 
for not being a dictatorship of &#8220;the whole class&#8221; &#8220;from the bottom up&#8221;, and was 
in favor of non-violence as a matter of principle. Its leadership was to 
disapprove of many of the revolutionary actions in which its rank and file would 
participate in 1920-1921. &#8220;Revolutionary syndicalism&#8221; (=FAUD(S)) was there to 
decree the general strike of all workers (proletarians), so it said: this strike 
would paralyze the economy and the bourgeoisie, and the trade unions would take 
affairs into their own hands and would organize the society of &#8220;the free and 
equal producers&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">The FAUD(S) was led by a central committee of old syndicalists, 
at whose head were R. Rocker and F. Kater, who defended a pacifist and 
anti-revolutionary syndicalism. They had been the first to proclaim the slogan 
of a united front, inviting the Spartacists and independent socialists, already 
in 1918, to join a &#8220;social-political&#8221; front. They would even continue to follow 
this policy in 1921, issuing invitations to the USPD as well as to the KPD/VKPD. 
In parallel with the Levi tendency, the German syndicalists adopted the same 
&#8220;anti-putschist&#8221; positions during the course of the March-April 1920, and March 
1921 events. Like the Levists, the central committee of the FAUD(S) would 
characterize the attacks which the left communists (of the KPD and KAPD) carried 
out against the trains carrying arms to Poland during the summer of 1920 as 
&#8220;romanticism&#8221;.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> As a delegate from the Ruhr declared, requesting that the 
term &#8220;syndicalist&#8221; be abandoned: &#8220;the syndicalists are not revolutionary enough 
in the eyes of the Ruhr miners.&#8221;<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the next period, the FAUD split into three principle 
tendencies. The leadership, now in the minority, upheld anarchosyndicalism in 
its original purity. It tried to set up a trade union international to rival the 
Communist International: the &#8220;IWA&#8221;. The IWW, the shop stewards and the CNT, 
however, tried to join the Communist International, through its affiliate the 
Red Trade Union International, founded in July of 1921. But the CI&#8217;s policies 
repelled them, since it wanted the traditional trade unions to join the RTUI, as 
well as to promote reformist struggles using more aggressive slogans and 
methods. If the IWA, founded at the end of 1922, would only have an ephemeral 
impact, by taking advantage of the RTUI&#8217;s opportunism, it at least managed to 
detour numerous revolutionary workers into a dead end. The primary activity of 
this new IWA would consist of denouncing the &#8220;communists&#8221; who were trying to 
shift the workers struggle away from its true terrain: the workers struggle. The 
behavior of the Communist International, at both the national and international 
levels, helped to push the revolutionaries&#8212;since at least some of these workers 
organizations showed a tendency towards radical actions and positions&#8212;into the 
arms of the reformists. It reinforced tendencies towards confusion and 
conciliation, which were strong in some trade unions (CNT), instead of 
extirpating or eliminating them.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Equally insignificant, the second tendency was grouped around the 
Düsseldorf journal <i>Die Schöpfung</i> (The Creation), characterized above all 
by its activism and its &#8220;anti-dogmatism&#8221;. Some of its adherents judged that they 
&#8220;had to vote despite their principles&#8221;. Others, in September 1921, elaborated a 
program of action which involved issuing an ultimatum to the government and the 
trade unions, whose rejection would lead to the general strike. Its members also 
created &#8220;communes&#8221; and anarchist schools, etc.</p>

<p class="fst">The most important tendency, whose further development is most 
noteworthy, was the so-called &#8220;FAU of Gelsenkirchen&#8221; (FAU(G)), whose nucleus was 
formed by former members of the USPD and the General Union of Miners. It only 
superficially adopted the syndicalist ideology, and became the economic 
organization of the VKPD, while retaining a certain degree of autonomy 
(concerning the VKPD, cf. Chapter 13). It left the FAUD in November 1920, and 
had 110,000 members at that time, primarily in the FAU of the 
Rhineland-Westphalia region and the General Union of Miners of Central Germany 
and Upper Silesia. After its founding in December 1920, the VKPD acknowledged it 
as a revolutionary factor. The FAU(G) admitted, for its part, that many of its 
members were members of the VKPD. In September of 1921, the FAU(G) fused with 
two other trade union organizations which had existed since 1918 to form the 
General Union of Manual and Intellectual Workers of Germany (Council 
Organization), with 168,000 members.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> It would be the only German trade union 
to join the RTUI. However, after years of opposition, the VKPD and the CI would 
force it to dissolve into various reactionary trade unions in 1925.</p>

<p class="fst">The phenomenon of the <i>unionen</i> reflected a situation in 
which the proletarians were neither capable of nor wanted to attack capital, but 
refused to carry out purely economistic actions in the usual corporativist 
manner: this explains their anti-trade union reaction and their efforts to <i>
unify themselves</i> in the <i>unionen</i>. Of course, since the assault was not 
undertaken with a firm resolve, reformism, no matter how strong it may have 
been, was condemned to failure. These new organizations would be eclipsed or 
would fall into dependence on another form of syndicalism, with apolitical 
aspirations but much more concerned with fighting against the Marxists than in 
driving the workers actions forward, and which would sabotage local and regional 
attempts at unification with unions inspired by left communists, who were judged 
to be &#8220;authoritarian&#8221; and violent. This narrow-minded spirit was a revelation of 
a<i> competitive</i> attitude typical of politics. Unionism would develop as a 
reaction against classical &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; syndicalism as much as against the 
ADGB.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">The Origins of Unionism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">(It should be emphasized that the <i>Unionen</i> discussed in 
this book were not (and in fact fought against) what are called &#8220;unions&#8221; in the 
English language (<i>Gewerkschaften</i> in German)) (Author&#8217;s note to the 
American edition).</p>

<p class="fst">Unionism, as a concept of proletarian revolutionary organization, 
was conceived by elements which had arrived during the war, at the time of the 
revolution in Germany, from the USA. The IWW, an organization of radical 
economic struggle, born in the USA at the beginning of the 20<sup style="font-size: 80%">th</sup> 
century, had historical roots which extended back to Owen&#8217;s theory of <i>One Big 
Union</i> (ca. 1830). The workers in the IWW were organized by factory and by 
industry. The IWW had various tendencies, one of which&#8212;a minority&#8212;asserted the 
need to form an alliance with a revolutionary political party; this tendency was 
inspired by DeLeon and was actually excluded from the IWW. The DeLeonist SLP and 
the workers groups under its influence worked in parallel with but separately 
from the IWW. DeLeon thought a party distinct from the unions was necessary in 
order to destroy the State: once this purely negative act had been consummated, 
the party would be eclipsed by the unions&#8217; administration of society. The 
majority of the IWW&#8217;s membership rejected this dual party/unions structure, and 
wanted to make the IWW the sole revolutionary organization. Dannenberg, having 
arrived from America, led a small unionist tendency in Braunschweig, and was 
undoubtedly influenced by DeLeon. The greatest difference between the IWW and 
anarchosyndicalism was the IWW&#8217;s dedication to the principle of the factory 
organization.</p>

<p class="fst">The IWW was considered to be a sympathetic but confused movement, 
or as one of those rare cases of a workers organization which was &#8220;not 
manipulated&#8221; from outside by a &#8220;party&#8221;. It played a role in the formation of the 
German Left. When the KAPist worker P. Mattick immigrated to the USA in 1926, he 
joined the IWW. The IWW&#8217;s real nature must be acknowledged, as well as its <i>
failure</i> in 1914, <i>just like</i> that of the parties and trade unions 
against which it carried out such an effective struggle. Its failure was not due 
only to its repression, which it had neither wanted to prepare for nor was 
capable of confronting. From its founding in 1905, it tried to remain on the 
margin of political groups, but it had an overwhelming tendency to ignore the 
question of power as well as that of the destruction of the State. It was more 
apolitical than antipolitical.<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> The IWW&#8217;s 1916 congress called for the 
organization of a general strike in case of war. <i>Just like</i> the 
resolutions of the Second International (cf. Chapter 4), this proposal would not 
be respected. A minority fraction demanded the implementation of the decisions 
of the 1916 congress when the US entered the war in April 1917. The IWW&#8217;s <i>
General Executive Board</i>, after long deliberation, refused to do so. Even 
after April 1917, when the IWW was under attack by the State and armed gangs 
(assassinations, arrests, destruction of its offices), the GEB took no action. 
B. Haywood, the IWW leader, stated that everything would return to the way it 
was before the war and that the organization would rebuild itself. For the next 
two years, the IWW restricted its defensive activity to the legal system ... 
which the State itself did not respect.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> The war revealed its limitations, 
just as it had exposed those of the trade unions and socialist parties.</p>

<p class="fst">Unionism held that the workers should be organized by factories 
and then by <i>economic regions</i> (and not by industries). This difference is 
crucial (within the context of the period under consideration, and obviously not 
as an abstract, ahistorical opposition): the point of view of industrial 
unionism, in its debates, and its power position, was framed in relation to the 
cartels and industrial trusts&#8212;it was a form of organization designed to return 
to the roots of true trade unionism. Organization by economic regions, however, 
united all the workers in the same region, transcending not only the trade or 
profession (like all unionism) but also the industry and even the factory; this 
kind of unionism which goes beyond the interests of trade, of factory, and of 
industry is, in fact, a geographical-strategic grouping with a view to 
revolutionary action and had a tendency to supersede the proletarian condition 
itself. Furthermore, the one time when a union, with the assistance of the AAUD, 
led a reformist struggle (in 1927), it was an industrial union: the Union of 
North Sea Fishermen.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1919, the unions were temporary associations which worked on 
the formation of councils: it was the councils and not the unions which were 
called upon to manage production. For all the currents of the period, socialism 
was a problem of management: the different conceptions of socialism concerned 
the form of workers management of production (by the party, by the council, the 
trade unions, the union, etc.). The unions appeared spontaneously during the war 
and the revolution. When the workers abandoned the trade unions they did so 
factory by factory and not by the basic units of trade union organization (the 
trades).</p>

<p class="fst">The idea of <i>unitary</i> organization (neither party, nor trade 
union, but something beyond both) appeared for the first time in an anonymous 
article in the Bremen <i>Arbeiterpolitik</i>, and was presented as a concept 
which had originated among rank and file workers. The &#8220;soul of the proletarian&#8221; 
cannot be divided into a &#8220;political soul&#8221; and an &#8220;economic soul&#8221;. In<i> Mass 
Strike, Party and Trade Unions</i>, Luxemburg had expressed the idea that the 
separation of the party and the trade union was by no means absolute. In a 
sense, what was taking place was a return to the primitive organization of the 
proletarians, except, this time, as the fruit of a more advanced movement. The 
trade union-party distinction was proof that the previous era was not 
revolutionary: the same was true of the distinction between maximum and minimum 
programs. The mere fact, however, that a proletarian organization would define 
itself, in the first place, in relation to the <i>workplace</i> shows that the 
proletarian offensive was deadlocked.</p>

<p class="fst">At the KPD&#8217;s founding congress, the left defended the concept of 
unitary organization. During the ensuing period of struggles, the party&#8217;s 
majority implemented the slogan &#8220;abandon the trade unions&#8221; and also helped to 
create the elements of the future AAU. The unionist current was seeking its own 
identity at the moment (May 1919) when the syndicalists broke with the 
revolutionary front. At that time, revolutionary groups were once again forming 
in the Ruhr, in Central Germany, and above all in various cities in the North 
(Bremen and Hamburg) in a series of organizations which were neither classical 
trade unions nor revolutionary syndicalist trade unions. In Hamburg, a direct 
line of descent connected the IWW to the unions. Wolffheim had spent several 
years with the IWW in California. With Laufenberg, he urged the workers to join 
the AAU when it was created in August of 1919, and they considered it to be the 
German section of the IWW.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was in Hamburg that unionism was theorized in particular 
detail. The Hamburg <i>Kommunistische Arbeiter-Zeitung</i> published numerous 
articles from May to August 1919 from various sources (&#8220;theoreticians&#8221;, &#8220;rank 
and file militants&#8221;, &#8220;trade unionists&#8221;, &#8220;communists&#8221;, etc.) under the rubric of 
&#8220;a contribution to the debate concerning the trade union question&#8221;. It was here 
that the idea arose that the party should end by dissolving itself into the AAU, 
after having contributed to the latter&#8217;s generalization. Moreover, all the 
tendencies and future splits were to be found in embryo within the debate 
concerning the <i>rate</i> at which this dissolution should proceed.</p>

<p class="fst">Organizations of the AAU type (by factory and by region) 
expressed a primordial fact: the workers who formed them carried out a 
revolutionary struggle by attacking the roots of the economic relations and not 
their effects. To declare oneself in favor of the dictatorship of the 
proletariat was also the sole criterion for membership in the AAU. Viewed 
negatively, only those workers who rejected any idea of reformist or partial 
struggle could organize in the AAU. When the revolutionary wave receded and was 
submerged in the sea of reformist action, the trade union-type organization, 
with its professional divisions, reigned unchallenged. The AAU ceased to be an 
instrument of struggle, since the struggle which it served no longer existed, 
and it would be relegated to the status of a subsidiary sect of the KAPD.</p>

<p class="fst">The relation between organization based on skills/trades and the 
reformist struggle would be negatively confirmed in 1923. The spectacular 
inflation of that year caused a day&#8217;s wage to lose one-third of its value after 
24 hours.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> The wage struggle once again having become impossible, the trade 
union organizations were dismantled and replaced by factory organizations: but 
this time the latter did not undertake any revolutionary action worthy of the 
name.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">The Formation of the &#8220;AAUD&#8221;</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In August 1919, factory organizations, acting upon the basis of 
the positions of the KPD, met in Essen to found the AAU of Essen. For the last 
time, the Levist central committee gave its assent to such an act. In itself, 
this meeting was of little importance, but the AAU was the focal point for the 
foundation of the AAUD. It participated in the foundation of the FAU(R-W) but 
quickly broke with the latter, since unionism was in the last stage of acquiring 
its own identity. The founding congress of the AAUD (General Union of German 
Workers) met on February 14, 1920. The principle spokespersons for unionism had 
become isolated: Wolffheim and Laufenberg had devoted themselves exclusively to 
propaganda for their national-bolshevik theses. Frölich and Becker had remained 
in the KPD and joined the fight against &#8220;leftism&#8221; (cf. Chapters X, XIII and XV, 
for the Bremen left).</p>

<p class="fst">The two leading tendencies at the congress were composed of those 
who called for the immediate abolition of the party organization (Roche, from 
Hamburg, and Rühle, from Dresden) and those who thought that it was necessary to 
maintain the party for a certain time (Schröder and the leadership of the future 
KAPD). The Hamburg national bolsheviks comprised a very small minority of the 
congress delegates. The first theoreticians of unionism were thrown overboard at 
the very moment that unionism began its existence.</p>

<p class="fst">During this period, Becker thought that the unions should &#8220;be 
intermediate organs between the party and the class&#8221;, a position which the other 
tendencies felt was too rigid. The split which developed among the &#8220;centralists&#8221; 
helped to hand over the leadership to the &#8220;federalists&#8221;, who were particularly 
strong in Hamburg and Dresden, and who would dominate the organization&#8217;s leading 
positions in 1920. For example, supreme authority was vested solely in the hands 
of the national congress: &#8220;The AAUD&#8217;s organization would never completely 
achieve the same stable character as the FAU. The AAUD was, more than any other 
union, the expression of the revolutionary movement of the <i>Betriebsräte</i>, 
and from the moment the revolutionary movement began to stagnate, this would 
appear as an enormous weakness.&#8221;<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> But this was only true from an extremely 
&#8220;organizational&#8221; point of view: as if the proletarian revolutionary movement 
should provide itself with (mass) organizations capable of resisting an 
extremely long counterrevolution. Again: organizations like the AAUD were so 
exceptionally subversive because they were so completely attuned to the 
revolutionary movement; they overcame the opposition between the movement and a 
petrified organization. The fact that they disappeared at the end of the 
revolutionary period would, instead, be a good sign, if one did not know that 
they would never admit the full extent of their failure and all of its 
implications.</p>

<p class="fst">Dannenberg&#8217;s tendency advocated &#8220;industrial unionism&#8221;: the unions 
should federate by industry and not by region, and should link up with a 
political party (in this case, the USPD). This tendency disappeared along with 
its leader in 1921, after having been excluded in 1920, &#8220;attacked by all other 
tendencies for its pro-USPD sympathies and its &#8216;economistic reformism&#8217;&#8221;.<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The debate at the congress was very confused, and the delegates 
had just enough time to agree about what the AAUD <i>was not</i>, before the 
police arrested them. But the organization&#8217;s foundation responded to a real 
movement. The formation of the unions coincided with a <i>de facto</i> break 
with and a rejection of trade union organization. To conceive of the AAUD in 
purely organizational terms, as one more link in &#8220;the life of groups&#8221;, is to 
have not understood it in its essence. In August 1919, the Union of Port and 
Shipyard Workers of Hamburg was formed, with a communist leadership. Such splits 
had a <i>political</i> basis: &#8220;It attacked the trade union <i>Zentrale</i> for 
its support of Ebert and the Kaiser&#8217;s generals, it supported arming the 
proletarians, recognition of the Russian soviet republic, militant solidarity 
with Russia, and opposition to Ebert-Scheidemann&#8217;s support of the Poles and the 
White Army. Had the revolutionary situation remained more generally aggressive, 
the events which took place in Bremen and Hamburg would have been repeated.&#8221;<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The second conference of the AAUD, which took place on March 
10-12, 1920, just before the Kapp Putsch, adopted some very simple statutes.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a> 
The Roche-Rühle tendency emerged victorious: federalism, no party. In November 
1920, the third conference convened while the KAPD was in its ascendant phase, 
after it had excluded Rühle and his supporters. Joint action between the KAPD 
and the AAUD was especially extensive during the month of August due to the 
sabotage of arms shipments to Poland. The KAPD tendency (Schröder) gained 
support. This tendency recognized the temporary necessity of the party as a 
separate institution, even after the revolution, at the advent of the 
dictatorship of the proletariat. The conference also adopted a very succinct 
program and a set of &#8220;General Guidelines&#8221;.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> These two texts were in absolute 
conformity with the KAPD program, from which entire passages were borrowed.</p>

<p class="fst">Rühle&#8217;s current separated from the AAUD (cf. Chapter 14). The 
destiny of the AAUD after its third conference was indistinguishable from that 
of the KAPD. What is essential is that, from the organizational point of view, 
the AAUD was not merely an appendix of the KAPD which the latter had created.</p>

<p class="fst">Particularly strong in Hamburg, Berlin (30,000 members in 
December 1920) and central Germany, the AAUD had 150,000 members in the winter 
of 1920-1921:<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a> during this same period the KAPD never had more than 40,000 
members. In December 1922, the AAUD would have no more than 120,000 members in 
its so-called &#8220;Berlin&#8221; tendency and a few hundred in the &#8220;Essen&#8221; tendency (cf. 
Appendix I). It was during 1919-1920, however, that the union was most active, 
even in terms of its propaganda: the union had at least ten weekly newspapers 
and its numerous pamphlets sometimes had print runs of 120,000. After 1923 it 
was left with almost no members. While the FAU(G) was stronger in the mines, the 
AAUD was especially strong in the metal industry. &#8220;The trunk of the class&#8221;,<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a> 
as Radek had described it at the congress of the Communist International, had 
thus abandoned its traditional organizations. This phenomenon of workers 
regroupment also took place, prior to 1914, in the British trade union movement, 
where the Triple Alliance consolidated the miners, the railroad workers and the 
transport workers in order to stage turbulent but non-revolutionary actions. The 
IWW, on the other hand, recruited mostly in the newer industries with a heavy 
representation of unorganized immigrants. These facts, by the way, refute the 
legend according to which the German Left was mostly composed of &#8220;déclassé&#8221; 
elements. The members of the AAUD were not <i>lumpen</i>, as Rosenberg would 
have us understand in his <i>History of the Weimar Republic</i>.<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> All layers 
of the working class were to be found in the AAUD, as well as in the FAUD, the 
KAPD and the KPD.</p>

<p class="fst">First, the members of the KAPD and the AAUD came from all layers 
of the proletariat. Furthermore, after half a century of social democratic 
domestication, and in opposition to the despotism of the factory, the rejection 
of the discipline of the various parties was something completely positive, 
especially in Germany. It has been said that the &#8220;leftists&#8221; lacked any 
experience of organization. But this is utterly untrue: they knew the 
organizations of their time all too well and knew that these organizations 
considered them to be a simple &#8220;mass&#8221; which was always led to defeat and 
massacre. An important fraction of radical proletarians acted in a revolutionary 
way and knew what they had to do. It is all to their credit that they did not 
want to hear of any discipline which did not originate among their own ranks. 
What would be absurd would be to raise anti-discipline, anti-organization and 
anti-authority to the status of categorical principles, as if the rebels of the 
various insurrectionary movements had not had their own leaders, organizations 
and discipline. The principle that &#8220;the whole world must give the orders&#8221; is 
only valid where there is nothing that has to be done.</p>

<p class="fst">As long as the AAUD was a living organization, its polemic 
against the anarcho-syndicalism which was attempting to return to organization by 
trade had a real basis. It was the expression of the movement of radical 
proletarians which, by organizing to achieve goals held in common by the whole 
proletariat, also entered into conflict with the forms which were keeping them 
isolated in stagnant compartments. As a distinct ideology, revolutionary 
syndicalism played a reactionary role during this phase. But when, during the 
period of reaction, some survivors of unionism devoted themselves to making a 
fetish of the forms of organization of the radical current of the German Left 
(councils, factory organizations, AAU, etc.), this propaganda underwent a change 
of function. Encouraging the workers to create these organizations was in this 
case a substitute for revolutionary action. And this was all the more dangerous 
insofar as these forms, which had previously expressed a subversive content, 
could become the vehicle for tendencies which were simply reformist, as a result 
of the further development of capital and of the forms of its domination.</p>
