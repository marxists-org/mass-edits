<h2>Preface</h2>

<p class="fst">It was in the whirlwind of revolution and counter-revolution that 
the foundations of the German Communist Workers Party were laid. But the birth 
of the new party doesn't date from Easter 1920, when the &quot;opposition&quot;, which up 
to then had only been united through vague contacts, came together in an 
organisational sense. The birth of the KAPD coincides with a phase of the 
development of the KPD (Spartacus League), during the course of which a clique 
of irresponsible leaders, placing their personal interests above those of the 
proletarian revolution, attempted to impose a personal conception of the &quot;death&quot; 
of the German revolution on the majority of the party. The latter energetically 
stood up against this manifestation of personal interest. The KAPD was born when 
this clique, basing itself on the personal conception that it had elaborated, 
tried to transform the tactic of the party, which, up to then had been 
revolutionary, into a reformist tactic. This treacherous attitude of Levi, 
Posner and Company led to the recognition of the fact that the radical 
elimination of any policy of leaders must constitute the first condition for the 
progress of the proletarian revolution in Germany. It is in reality the root of 
the opposition which appeared between us and the Spartacus League, an opposition 
of such depth that the gulf which separates us from the KPD is greater than the 
opposition which exists between the likes of Levi, Pieck, Thalheimer, etc., on 
one side, and the the Hilferdings, Crispiens, Stampfers, Legiens on the other. 
The idea that in a really proletarian organisation the revolutionary will of the 
masses is the preponderant factor in the taking of tactical positions is the 
leitmotif in the organisational construction of our party. To express the 
autonomy of the members in all circumstances is the basic principle of a 
proletarian party, which is not a party in the traditional sense.</p>

<p class="fst">It is thus evident to us that the programme of the party that we 
are conveying here, and which has been drawn up by the programme commission 
mandated by the congress, must remain a draft programme up until the next 
ordinary congress declares itself in agreement with the present version. Of the 
remainder of the proposed amendments, which could concern the fundamental 
positions and tactics of the party, they are hardly likely to be adopted given 
that the programme has faithfully formulated, in a broader framework, the 
content of the programmatic declaration adopted unanimously by the party 
congress. But eventual formal amendments will change nothing of the 
revolutionary spirit which animates each line of the programme. The marxist 
recognition of the historic necessity of the dictatorship of the proletariat 
rests for us an immutable and steadfast guide for the international class 
struggle. Under this flag, the victory of the proletariat is assured.</p>

<h2>Programme of the Communist Workers Party of Germany</h2>

<p class="fst">The world economic crisis, born from the world war, with its 
monstrous social and economic effects which produce the thunderstruck impression 
of a field of ruins of colossal dimensions, can only signify one thing: the 
Twilight of the Gods of the bourgeois-capitalist world order is nigh. Today, it 
is not a question of the periodic economic crises which were once a part of the 
capitalist mode of production; it is the <i>crisis</i> of capitalism itself; we 
are witnessing convulsive spasms of the whole of the social organism, formidable 
outbursts of class antagonisms of an unprecedented pitch, general misery for 
wide layers of populations: all this is a fateful warning to bourgeois society. 
It appears more and more clearly that the ever-growing antagonism between 
exploiters and exploited, that the contradiction between capital and labour, the 
consciousness of which is becoming more widespread even among those previously 
apathetic layers of the proletariat, cannot be resolved. Capitalism is 
experiencing its definitive failure, it has plunged itself into the abyss in a 
war of imperialist robbery; it has created a chaos whose unbearable prolongation 
places the proletariat in front of the historic alternative: relapse into 
barbarism or construction of a socialist world.</p>

<p class="fst">Of all the peoples of the Earth only the Russian proletariat has 
up to now succeeded in its titanic struggle to overthrow the domination of its 
capitalist class and seize political power. In a heroic resistance it has pushed 
back the concentrated attack of the army of mercenaries organised by 
international capital, and it now confronts a task of unsurpassed difficulty: 
that of reconstructing, on a socialist basis, an economy totally destroyed by 
world war and the civil war which followed it for more than two years. The fate 
of the Russian republic of councils depends on the development of the 
proletarian revolution in Germany. After the victory of the German revolution we 
will see the emergence of a socialist economic bloc which, through the 
reciprocal exchange of the products of industry and agriculture, will be capable 
of establishing a real socialist mode of production, no longer obliged to make 
economic, and thus also political, concessions to world capital. If the German 
proletariat doesn't fulfil its historic task very soon, the development of the 
world revolution will be called into question for years, if not for decades. In 
fact it is Germany which is today the key to the world revolution. The 
revolution in the &quot;victor&quot; countries of the Entente can only get underway when 
the great barrier of central Europe has been raised. The economic conditions of 
the proletarian revolution are incomparably more favourable in Germany than in 
the &quot;victor&quot; countries of western Europe. The German economy, ruthlessly 
plundered after the signing of the Versailles Peace Treaty, has brought to a 
head a degree of pauperisation which demands a rapid and radical solution. 
Furthermore, the peace of the brigands of Versailles does not only weigh on the 
capitalist mode of production in Germany, but makes life increasingly 
unendurable for the proletariat as well. Its most dangerous aspect is that it 
undermines the economic foundations of the future socialist economy in Germany, 
and thus, in this sense, also calls into question the development of the world 
revolution. Only one headlong push forward by the German proletarian revolution 
can bring us out of this dilemma. The economic and political situation in 
Germany is more than ripe for the outbreak of proletarian revolution. At this 
stage of historic evolution, where the process of the decomposition of 
capitalism can no longer be artificially obscured, the proletariat has to become 
aware that it needs an energetic intervention in order to effectively use the 
power that it already possesses. In an epoch of revolutionary class struggle 
like this, where the last phase of the struggle between capital and labour has 
begun and where the decisive combat itself is already underway, there can be no 
question of compromise with the enemy, but only a fight to the death. In 
particular, it is necessary to attack the institutions which seek to make a 
bridge across the gulf of class antagonisms and which orient themselves towards 
class collaboration between exploiters and exploited. At a time when the 
objective conditions for the outbreak of the proletarian revolution have already 
arrived, and when the permanent crisis can only get worse and worse, there must 
be reasons of a subjective nature that are holding back the accelerated progress 
of the revolution. In other words: the consciousness of the proletariat is still 
partly trapped by bourgeois or petty-bourgeois ideology. The psychology of the 
German proletariat, in its present aspect, shows very distinct traces of a 
long-standing enslavement to militarism, and is characterised by a real lack of 
self-awareness. This is the natural product of the parliamentary cretinism of 
the old Social Democracy and of the USPD on one side, and of the absolutism of 
the union bureaucracy on the other. These subjective elements play a decisive 
role in the German revolution. The problem of the German revolution is the 
problem of <i>the development of the German proletariat's consciousness of 
itself</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Recognising this situation and the necessity to accelerate the 
rhythm of the development of the revolution in the world, as well as being 
faithful to the spirit of the 3rd International, the KAPD is fighting for the 
maximum demand of the immediate abolition of bourgeois democracy and the 
establishment of the dictatorship of the working class. It rejects in the 
democratic constitution the principle, doubly absurd and untenable in the 
present period, of conceding to the exploiting capitalist class political rights 
and the power to exclusively dispose of the means of production.</p>

<p class="fst">In conformity with its maximalist views the KAPD equally declares 
itself for the rejection of all reformist and opportunist methods of struggle, 
which is only a way of avoiding serious and decisive struggles with the 
bourgeois class. The party doesn't seek to avoid these struggles, but on the 
contrary actively encourages them. In a State which carries all the symptoms of 
the period of the decadence of capitalism, the participation in parliamentarism 
is also part of these reformist and opportunist methods. In such a period, to 
exhort the proletariat to participate in parliamentary elections can only 
nourish the dangerous illusion that the crisis can be overcome through 
parliamentary means. It means resorting to a means used in the past by the 
bourgeoisie in its class struggle, whereas we are now in a situation where only 
the methods of proletarian class struggle, applied in a resolute and forthright 
manner, can have a decisive effect. Participation in bourgeois parliamentarism 
in the thick of the proletarian revolution can only signify the sabotage of the 
idea of the councils.</p>

<p class="fst">The idea of the councils in the period of proletarian struggle 
for political power is at the centre of the revolutionary process. The more or 
less strong echo that the idea of the councils arouses in the consciousness of 
the masses is the thermometer which makes it possible to measure the development 
of the social revolution. The struggle for the recognition of the revolutionary 
factory councils and political workers' councils in the framework of a given 
revolutionary situation logically gives rise to the struggle for the 
dictatorship of the proletariat against the dictatorship of capitalism. This 
revolutionary struggle, whose specific political axis is constituted by the idea 
of the councils, is compelled, under the pressure of historic necessity, to come 
up against the totality of bourgeois social order and thus also against its 
political form, bourgeois parliamentarism. The system of councils or 
parliamentarism? It is a question of historic importance. To build a 
proletarian-communist world or to be shipwrecked in the storms of 
bourgeois-capitalist anarchy? In a situation as totally revolutionary as the 
present situation in Germany, participation in parliamentarism thus signifies 
not only the sabotage of the idea of councils, but also helps to give the 
putrefying bourgeois order a new lease of life, and thus to obstruct the 
progress of the proletarian revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">Aside from bourgeois parliamentarism, the unions form the 
principal rampart against the further development of the proletarian revolution 
in Germany. Their attitude during the world war is well-known. Their decisive 
influence on the principal orientation and tactics of the old Social Democratic 
Party led to the proclamation of the &quot;Union Sacrée&quot; with the German bourgeoisie, 
which was equivalent to a declaration of war on the international proletariat. 
Their efficacy as social-traitors found its logical continuation at the time of 
the outbreak of the November 1918 revolution in Germany. Here they showed their 
counter-revolutionary intentions by co-operating with crisis-ridden German 
industrialists to set up a &quot;community of labour&quot; (Arbeitsgemeinschaft) for 
social peace. They have maintained their counter-revolutionary attitude up to 
today, throughout the whole period of the German revolution. It is the 
bureaucracy of the unions which have most violently opposed the idea of the 
councils which was taking more and more profound root in the German working 
class; it is the unions who found the means to successfully paralyse all 
strivings for proletarian political power, which logically resulted from mass 
actions on the economic terrain. The counter-revolutionary character of the 
union organisations is so notorious that numerous bosses in Germany will only 
take on workers belonging to a union group. This reveals to the whole world that 
the union bureaucracy will take an active part in the maintenance of a 
capitalist system which is coming apart at the seams. The unions are thus, 
alongside the bourgeois substructure, one of the principal pillars of the 
capitalist state. Union history over these last 18 months has amply demonstrated 
that this counter-revolutionary formation cannot be transformed from the inside. 
The revolutionising of the unions is not a question of individuals: the 
counter-revolutionary character of these organisation is located in their 
structure and in their specific way of operating. From this it flows logically 
that only the <i>destruction of the unions</i> can clear the road for social 
revolution in Germany. The building of socialism needs something other than 
these fossilised organisations.</p>

<p class="fst">It is in the mass struggles that the factory organisation 
appears. It surfaces as something which hasn't had and couldn't have any 
equivalent, but that is not its novelty. What is new is that it penetrates 
everywhere during the revolution, as a necessary arm of the class struggle 
against the old spirit and the old foundations which were its base. It 
corresponds to the idea of the councils; that is why it is absolutely not a pure 
form or a new organisational trick, or even a &quot;dark mystery&quot;; organically born 
in the future, constituting the future, it is the form of expression of a social 
revolution which tends towards a society without classes. It is an organisation 
of pure proletarian struggle. The proletariat cannot be organised for the 
merciless overthrow of the old society if it is torn into strips by job 
category, away from its terrain of struggle; it must carry out its struggle in 
the factory. It is here that workers stand side by side as comrades; it is here 
that all are forced to be equal. It is here that the masses are the motor of 
production and are ceaselessly pushed to take control of production, to unveil 
its secrets. It is here that the ideological struggle, the revolutionising of 
consciousness, undergoes a permanent tumult, from man to man, from mass to mass. 
Everything is oriented towards the supreme class interest, not towards the craze 
for founding organisations, and the particular job interests are reduced to the 
measure which is due to them. Such an organisation, the dorsal fin of the 
factory councils, becomes an infinitely more supple instrument of the class 
struggle, always an organism receiving fresh blood, owing to the permanent 
possibility of re-elections, revocation, etc. Going forward in the mass actions 
and along with them, the factory organisations will naturally have to create for 
themselves the centralised organs which correspond to their revolutionary 
development. Their principal business will be the development of the revolution 
and not programmes, statutes and plans in detail. It is not a credit bank or 
life assurance, even if - this goes without saying - it makes collections when 
it's necessary to support strikes. Uninterrupted propaganda for socialism, 
factory assemblies, political discussions etc., all that is part of its tasks; 
in brief, it is the revolution in the factory.</p>

<p class="fst">In the main, the aim of the factory organisation is twofold. The 
first aim is the destruction of the unions, the totality of their bases and all 
the non-proletarian ideas which are concentrated around them. No doubt of course 
in this struggle the factory organisation will meet as desperate enemies all the 
bourgeois formations; but the same applies to the partisans of the USPD and the 
KPD, in so far as the latter are trapped unawares in the old schemas of Social 
Democracy. (even if they adopt a politically different programme, they 
essentially remain a politico-moral critique of the &quot;errors&quot; of Social 
Democracy). These tendencies can even act as open enemies, inasmuch as in their 
eyes political trafficking and the diplomatic arts are still &quot;above&quot; the 
gigantic social struggle in general. Faced with these petty drudges one can have 
no scruples. There can be no agreement with the USPD as they do not recognise 
the justification of factory organisations, on the basis of the struggle for 
workers' councils. A great number of the masses already recognise them, rather 
than the USPD, as their political leadership. This is a good sign. The factory 
organisation, by unleashing mass strikes and by transforming their political 
orientation, basing themselves every time on the political situation of the 
moment, will contribute much more rapidly and much more thoroughly to unmasking 
and destroying the counter-revolutionary trade unions.</p>

<p class="fst">The second great aim of the factory organisation is to prepare 
for the building of communist society. Any worker who declares for the 
dictatorship of the proletariat can become a member. Moreover it is necessary to 
resolutely reject the trade unions, and to be resolutely free from their 
ideological orientation. This last condition will be the cornerstone for being 
admitted into the factory organisation. It is through this that one shows one's 
adhesion to the proletarian class struggle and to its own methods; we do not 
demand adhesion to a more precise party programme. Through its nature and its 
inherent tendencies the factory organisation serves communism and leads to the 
communist society. Its kernel will always be expressly communist, its struggle 
pushes everyone in the same direction. On the other hand, the programme of the 
party has to deal with social reality in its widest sense; and the most serious 
intellectual qualities are demanded from party members. A political party like 
the KAPD, which goes forward and rapidly modifies itself in liaison with the 
world revolutionary process, can never have a great quantitative importance (if 
it is not to regress and become corrupt). But the revolutionary masses are, on 
the contrary, united in the factory organisations through their class 
solidarity, through the consciousness of belonging to the proletariat. It is 
this which organically prepares the unity of the proletariat; whereas on the 
basis of a party programme alone this unity is never possible. The factory 
organisation is the beginning of the communist form and becomes the foundation 
of the communist society to come.</p>

<p class="fst">The factory organisation carries out its tasks in close union 
with the KAPD.</p>

<p class="fst">The political organisation has the task of bringing together the 
most advanced elements of the working class on the basis of the party programme.</p>

<p class="fst">The relationship of the party to the factory organisation comes 
from the nature of the factory organisation. The work of the KAPD inside these 
organisations will be that of an unflagging propaganda, as well as putting 
forward the slogans of the struggle. The revolutionary cadres in the factory 
become the mobile arm of the party. Further, it is naturally necessary that the 
party always takes on for itself a more proletarian character, that it complies 
with the dictatorship from below. Through this the circle of its tasks grows 
wider, but at the same time it acquires the most powerful support. What has to 
be achieved is that the victory (the taking of power by the proletariat) ends up 
in the dictatorship of the class and not the dictatorship of a few party leaders 
and their clique. The factory organisation is the guarantee of this.</p>

<p class="fst">The phase of taking political power by the proletariat demands 
the firmest repression of capitalist-bourgeois movements. That will be achieved 
by putting in place an organisation of councils exercising the totality of 
political and economic power. In this phase the factory organisation itself 
becomes an element of the proletarian dictatorship, carried through into the 
factory. This latter moreover has the task of transforming itself into the base 
unit of the councils' economic system.</p>

<p class="fst">The factory organisation is an economic condition for the 
construction of the communist community (Gemeinwesen). The political form of the 
organisation of the communist community is the system of the councils. The 
factory organisation intervenes so that political power is only exercised by the 
executive of the councils.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD thus struggles for the realisation of the maximum 
revolutionary programme, the concrete demands of which are contained in the 
following points:</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Political domain:</i></p>

<p class="indentb">1. Immediate political and economic fusion with all victorious 
proletarian countries (Soviet Russia, etc.), in the spirit of the international 
class struggle, with the aim of a common self-defence against the aggressive 
actions of world capital.</p>

<p class="indentb">2. Arming of the politically organised revolutionary working 
class, setting up local military defence groups (Ortswehren), the formation of a 
Red Army; disarmament of the bourgeoisie, of all police, all officers, of 
'citizens' defence groups&quot; (Einwohnerwehren), etc.</p>

<p class="indentb">3. Dissolution of all parliaments and all municipal councils.</p>

<p class="indentb">4. Formation of workers' councils as legislative and executive 
organs of power. Election of a central council of delegates of the workers' 
councils of Germany.</p>

<p class="indentb">5. Meeting of a congress of German councils as a supreme 
political authority of the Councils of Germany.</p>

<p class="indentb">6. Taking over control of the press by the working class under 
the leadership of the local political councils.</p>

<p class="indentb">7. Destruction of the bourgeois judicial apparatus and the 
immediate installation of revolutionary tribunals. Taking charge of the 
bourgeois prison system and the security services by appropriate proletarian 
organs.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Economic, social and structural domain</i></p>

<p class="indentb">1. Cancellation of state and other public debts, cancellation of 
war reparations.</p>

<p class="indentb">2. Expropriation by the republic of councils of all banks, mines, 
foundries as well as the large firms of industry and commerce.</p>

<p class="indentb">3. Confiscation of all wealth over a certain threshold, the 
latter fixed by the central council of the workers' councils of Germany.</p>

<p class="indentb">4. Transformation of private landed property into collective 
property under the leadership of the competent local and rural councils 
(Gutsräte).</p>

<p class="indentb">5. The republic of councils to take charge of all public 
transports.</p>

<p class="indentb">6. Regulation and central management of the totality of 
production by the higher economic councils, which must be mandated by the 
congress of economic councils.</p>

<p class="indentb">7. Adaption of the whole of production to need, based on the most 
detailed statistical economic calculations.</p>

<p class="indentb">8. Ruthless enforcement of the obligation to work.</p>

<p class="indentb">9. Guarantee of individual existence relative to food, clothing, 
housing, old age, sickness, invalidity, etc.</p>

<p class="indentb">10. Abolition of all caste, decorative and titled differences. 
Complete juridical and social equality of the sexes.</p>

<p class="indentb">11. Immediate radical transformation of provisions, housing and 
health in the interests of the proletarian population.</p>

<p class="indentb">12. At the same time as the KAPD declares the most resolute war 
on the capitalist mode of production and the bourgeois state, it directs its 
attack against the totality of bourgeois ideology and makes itself the pioneer 
of a world proletarian-revolutionary conception. An essential factor in the 
acceleration of the social revolution resides in the revolutionising of the 
whole intellectual world of the proletariat. Conscious of this fact, the KAPD 
supports all revolutionary tendencies in science and the arts, all those 
elements which correspond to the spirit of the <i>proletarian</i> revolution.</p>

<p class="indentb">In particular, the KAPD encourages all serious revolutionary 
efforts which allow the youth of both sexes to express themselves. The KAPD 
rejects all domination over youth. The political struggle compels the youth to 
attain a superior development of its forces; this gives us the certitude that it 
will accomplish its greatest tasks with a total clarity and resolution. In the 
interests of the revolution, it is the duty of the KAPD that youth gets all the 
support possible in its struggle.</p>

<p class="indentb">The KAPD is conscious also that after the conquest of political 
power by the proletariat, a great domain of activity falls upon youth in the 
construction of communist society: the defence of the republic of councils by 
the Red Army, the transformation of the process of production, the creation of 
communist labour schools which will carry out their creative tasks in close 
connection with the factory.</p>

<p class="fst">This then is the programme of the Communist Workers' Party of 
Germany. Faithful to the spirit of the Third International, the KAPD remains 
attached to the idea of the founders of scientific socialism, according to which 
the conquest of political power by the proletariat signifies the destruction of 
the political power of the bourgeoisie. To destroy the totality of the bourgeois 
state apparatus with its capitalist army under the leadership of bourgeois and 
landed officers, with its police, its gaolers and its judges, with its priests 
and bureaucrats - here is the first task of the proletarian revolution. The 
victorious proletariat must be steeled against the blows of the bourgeois 
counter-revolution. When this is imposed on it by the bourgeoisie, the 
proletariat must strive to crush the exploiters' civil war with a ruthless 
violence. The KAPD is conscious that the final struggle between capital and 
labour cannot be settled inside national frontiers. As little as capitalism 
stops in front of national frontiers and holds back due to some national scruple 
or other in its incursion through the world, as little can the proletariat 
afford to be hypnotised by nationalist ideology and lose sight of the 
fundamental idea of international class solidarity. The more the idea of the 
international class struggle is clearly grasped by the proletariat, the more it 
will become the leitmotif of world proletarian policy, and the more impulsive 
and massive will be the blows of the world revolution which will break into 
pieces the decomposing capitalist world. Beyond all national particularities, 
beyond all frontiers and all fatherlands, the eternal beacon shines for the 
proletariat: <i>proletarians of all countries, unite!</i></p>
