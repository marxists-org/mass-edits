<h2>Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands</h2>
<h1>Appeal to the Proletariat of Germany!</h1>
<h3>1920</h3>
<hr>

<p class="information">The following Appeal was adopted on the 1st Ordinary 
Congress of the Communist Workers Party of Germany (the KAPD) on the 4th of 
August 1920.</p>

<p class="information">The Appeal was prepared during the Congress by a special commission. It is not 
completely clear, but most likely that this commission was identical with the 
commission elected on the 2nd of August 1920 in order to refine the draft 
<a href="programme.htm">Programme of the KAPD</a>. This commission consisted of Karl Schröder, Arthur 
Goldstein and Alexander Schwab.</p>

<p class="information">The presentation and adoption of the Proclamation was done immediately before 
the <a href="../../../../archive/schwab/1920/08/04.htm">Report on the Political Situation</a> made by Alexander Schwab, who started 
referring to it as if being one of its authors.</p>

<hr>

<p class="fst">Workers! Class comrades! The lance of the raging and united 
attacks by World capital and its accomplices against Soviet Russia has been 
broken by the annihilating defeat of Poland and by the victorious advance of the 
Red Army towards India and to the Black Sea. The next effect of World capital's 
will to destroy is the systematic organisation of White Terror. In Hungary and 
Poland, in America and India, the beast of this White Terror is pausing. In 
Germany, the will to destroy has found its expression in the disarmament law. 
This disarmament law means the legal establishment of White Terror, on the 
orders of Entente capital with the agreement of the German bourgeoisie, in order 
to be able to club the revolutionary proletariat to the ground. Only the 
revolutionary proletariat and not the bourgeoisie will feel the barbs of the 
exceptional law.</p>

<p class="fst">Don't be fooled by those who want you to believe that the 
disarmament of the reaction must be preceded by the disarmament of the 
proletariat, because the disarmament of the revolution can only be the work of 
the revolution. Therefore the slogan must be: Workers, don't deliver yourselves 
to reaction without a fight!</p>

<p class="fst">World capital is readying itself for the decisive battle between 
capital and labour, it is making the preparations for the complete annihilation 
of revolutionary thought and will. Over everything there stands as a flaming 
warning for the proletariat the words of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>: Either 
communism or barbarism!</p>

<p class="fst">The eyes of our Russia brothers, of the proletarians of all 
countries, are upon us, the proletariat of Germany. Germany is the strongest 
bulwark of world reaction and is therefore the key to world revolution. Let us 
be aware of our world historical task!</p>

<p class="fst">The Treaty of Versailles, Spa, the disarmament law and the rest 
are only the preparations for the most decisive blow against the proletariat. 
Recognising this means to understand the present tasks of the proletariat. 
Tighter and more oppressively capital is pulling the noose around the neck of 
the proletariat. Let us tear it apart, before it strangles us!</p>

<p class="fst">Not protest rallies and resolutions, but deeds are the order of 
the day! Away with compromises and tactics in negotiations! Away with 
theoretical hair-splitting. There can be no agreement. The slogan is struggle. 
Away with the fetters of wage slavery.</p>

<p class="fst">We must shake off our inactivity. We want the arrogance born of 
power of a small clique of owners no more! The complete annihilation of the 
bourgeois/capitalist economic and social mode of existence is and must be the 
aim of our struggle. Only on the ruins of the old world can the new coming world 
of communism come into being.</p>

<p class="fst">The hour of decision nears. Prevent the annihilating blows of 
World capital! Form a block with the pioneers of the World revolution. Fight 
shoulder to shoulder with your class comrades, not for the interests of a party, 
but for communism, which does not correspond to the wishes of a party, but to 
the interests of the World proletariat. For the dictatorship of the proletariat! 
For the Communist International! For the council system! Against servitude and 
tyranny! Forwards to the liberation of humanity! At stake is the future of the 
working class. To Action!</p>

<p class="fst">Long live the World Revolution!</p>
