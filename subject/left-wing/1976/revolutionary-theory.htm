<p class="information">This text is Chapter 8 of <i>Marxism and Council Communism, 
The foundation for revolutionary theory for modern society</i>, by Peter J. 
Rachleff, Revisionist press, NY. 1976.</p>

<p class="information">Digitalized by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090221055640/www.kurasje.org" target="_blank">kurasje.org</a>; transcribed into HTML by <a href="../../../admin/volunteers/steering.htm">Jonas Holmgren</a> for the Marxists Internet Archive</p>

<hr>

<p class="fst">Council communism emerged theoretically and politically in 
Germany and Holland in the 1920's as a distinct alternative to the Leninist 
theory of revolution and its political practice, both in Russia and 
internationally, through the Third International. Their theories were derived 
initially from their experiences in the movement for workers' councils in the 
abortive German Revolution of 1918 and in the early years of the Weimar Republic 
as well as their study of the council (or "soviet") movement in Russia during 
the revolutionary periods of 1905 and 1917.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> Councilist theory did not emerge 
full blown, but developed over the next several decades, based on an 
increasingly refined critique of the Leninist experience in Russia and 
internationally, as well as a fuller understanding of the process of proletarian 
revolution and a clearer conception of the nature of a communist society. A 
clear thread throughout these notions is an adherence to the methods and spirit 
of Marx's analysis of capitalism and the nature of proletarian revolution, 
maintaining above all else that "the emancipation of the working class is the 
task of the workers themselves."<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> A fundamental notion of council communism is 
that the means and ends of the revolutionary process are inextricably 
intertwined, that the course of the revolution inevitably determines the nature 
of the new society itself. Thus, the organizational forms that they discuss as 
appropriate for the process of the revolution are also considered to provide the 
organizational bases of the new society.</p>

<p class="fst">It should be emphasized that the councilists did not seek to <i>
impose</i> in theory or in practice an organizational form on the workers' 
movement. They initially stressed the "council" form because they saw it as the 
spontaneous creation of the working class in its struggle against capitalism.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> 
Their primary loyalty remained with the self emancipation of the working class 
in whatever form it might take. Pannekoek made this quite clear in an article he 
wrote towards the end of his life.</p>

<p class="fst">"Workers' councils" does not designate a fixed form of 
organization, elaborated once and for all and for which all that remains is to 
perfect its details; it concerns a principle, that of workers' self management 
of the enterprise and of production. The realization of this principle can never 
occur through a theoretical discussion concerning the best means of execution. 
It is a question of the practical struggle against the apparatus of capitalist 
domination. From our time, one does not understand at all by "workers' councils" 
a fraternal association having an end in itself; "workers' councils," this means 
to say the class struggle, (where fraternity has a part), revolutionary action 
against the power of the State. Revolutions are not made on command, this is 
evident; they surge spontaneously, when the situation becomes intolerable, in 
moments of crisis. They are born only if the sentiment of intolerability affirms 
itself constantly in the heart of the masses, at the same time that a certain 
homogeneous consciousness of what it Is necessary to do appears ...</p>

<p class="fst">Thus, the idea of "workers' councils" has nothing in common with 
a program of practical realizations to put to work tomorrow or next year it only 
concerns a connecting thread for the long and hard struggle of emancipation that 
the working class has still before it.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was never the intention of the council communist movement to 
create a new ideology concerning the organizational forms of the class struggle. 
Rather, in the finest Marxist tradition, they sought to comprehend the self 
emancipatory movement of the working class, to elucidate it theoretically, and 
to further it practically. It is through their adherence to the notion of self 
emancipation that they sought to criticize all organizational forms which 
hindered this process and to demonstrate theoretically the potentiality of self 
emancipation and the creation of a new society based on "the free and equal 
association of the producers."</p>

<p class="fst">Initially, councilist theory grew out of the opposition to 
Bolshevism on the part of some German and Dutch communists in the early 1920's. 
The critique of the Russian Revolution was undertaken to demonstrate the 
inapplicability of the Bolshevik model of revolution to advanced capitalist 
countries. In 1920, Herman Gorter, the Dutch poet and communist, responded in 
the form of an open letter to Lenin's pamphlet, <i>Left Wing Communism, An 
Infantile Disorder</i>, which was, in effect, an attempt on the part of the 
Russian leader to impose the Bolshevik models of organization and revolutionary 
activity on the communist parties of western Europe, to tighten his control over 
both his own party in Russia (in the face of increasing internal dissension) and 
over the international revolutionary movement. Gorter argued that the concrete 
differences between Russia and western Europe the social situation and 
revolutionary potentials of various classes, particularly the proletariat and 
the peasantry due to the differences in historical development and level of 
development of mode of production, was such as to militate against the 
generalization of tactics from one society to another.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> In particular, Gorter 
objected to the notions advanced by Lenin concerning: 1) the relationship of 
leaders to the masses; 2) trade union activity; 3) parliamentary activity. Gorter did not reject leadership per se, but rather took exception to Lenin's 
position on the relationship that he proposed should exist between leaders and 
masses.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> Gorter argued that the development of western Europe necessitated 
greater emphasis on the role of the masses themselves.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"To the degree that the importance of the class increases, the 
importance of leaders decreases in proportion. This is not to say that we should 
not have the best leaders possible: the best among the best are not yet good 
enough and we are trying to find them. This means only that in comparison with 
the importance of the masses, that of the leaders decreases ...</p>

<p class="quoteb">Have you not remarked, Comrade Lenin, that there aren't any 
"great" leaders in Germany? They are all ordinary men. This already shows that 
this revolution ought to be in the first place the work of the masses and not 
the leaders ..."<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Gorter saw the role of the vanguard being primarily one of 
"propaganda by the deed" as opposed to strict leadership and control of the 
masses by the party. He refers to "the formation ... of a group who shows in 
their struggles what the masses ought to do."<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> He sums up his rejection of 
Lenin's notion "in one word because you present a leadership politics."<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Gorter also objects to Lenin's demand that the western European 
left should engage in trade union and parliamentary activity. Lenin's belief in 
the value of such activity was attacked by Gorter who responded that "you want 
to stifle the organizations in which the workers, each worker, and by 
consequence the mass, can attain strength and power, and you want to preserve 
those in which the mass is a dead instrument in the hands of the leaders."<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> 
Both trade unionism and parliamentary activity encourage passivity on the part 
of the working class, thus hindering the development of mass initiative and 
revolutionary class consciousness. Gorter cites Pannekoek on this matter:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The tactical problem consists in finding the means of 
extirpating the traditional bourgeois mentality which dominates the masses and 
weakens their forces. Everything which further reinforces the traditional 
conception is negative. The most solid aspect, the most tenacious part of this 
mentality is, precisely, their dependence vis a vis leaders, to whom they 
abandon the solution of all general questions, the direction of their class 
interests."<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Gorter summarizes his position thusly:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"1. The tactic of the Western revolution must be entirely other 
than that of the Russian Revolution;</p>

<p class="quoteb">2. Because the proletariat is here all alone;</p>

<p class="quoteb">3. The proletariat must thus here make the revolution alone 
against all the classes;</p>

<p class="quoteb">4. The importance of the proletarian masses is thus relatively 
greater, that of the leaders less than in Russia;</p>

<p class="quoteb">5. And the proletariat must have better arms for the revolution;</p>

<p class="quoteb">6. As the unions are defective arms, it is necessary to suppress 
them or radically change them, and put in their place factory organizations, 
united in a general organization;</p>

<p class="quoteb">7. As the proletariat must make the revolution alone, and not 
rely on any help, it must raise its consciousness and courage to great heights. 
And it is referable to ignore parliamentarism in the revolution."<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Despite his rejection of Lenin's notions or, rather, orders 
Gorter avoids attacking Lenin directly or questioning the class nature of the 
Russian Revolution and the developments in Russia since 1917. He appeals to 
Lenin to reconsider his position. Gorter differentiates himself from those who 
have already become bitter opponents of Lenin and the Third International, 
having seen the latter organization as a tool for strengthening the Bolshevik 
state apparatus. Rather, Gorter believes that Lenin is merely wrong in his 
assessment of the situation and can be made to see the error of his ways, 
writing: "As for me, I think, as I have said all along, that you misunderstood 
the European situation."<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> This somewhat naive position was soon abandoned by 
the councilist group as a whole. The slaughter at Kronstadt, the suppression of 
the Workers' Opposition, and other events soon made apparent the repressive 
nature of the Russian state.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> The councilists turned their attention toward 
an understanding of the class nature of the Russian Revolution, the nature of 
Leninist politics, and the philosophical foundations of Leninism, in an effort 
to criticize and fight against everything that stood in the way of the self 
emancipation of the working class.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>The critique of Bolshevism in Russia</h3>

<p class="fst">In December 1934, <i>International Council Correspondence</i> 
translated and printed the councilist "Theses on Bolshevism," an in depth 
analysis of the Russian Revolution, written by the Dutch group. This was not 
primarily a vindictive essay against Lenin and the Bolshevik Party. Rather, it 
was argued that the party had merely carried out the tasks necessitated by the 
historical development of Russia.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The economic task of the Russian Revolution was, first, the 
setting aside of the concealed agrarian feudalism and its continued exploitation 
of the peasants as serfs, together with the industrialization of agriculture, 
placing it on the plane of modern commodity production; secondly, to make 
possible the unrestrained creation of a class of really "free laborers," 
liberating the industrial development from all its feudal fetters Essentially, 
the tasks of the bourgeois revolution.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">These socio economic conditions necessitated certain political 
behavior, i.e., an attack on specific socio political institutions. Here, too, 
however, the bourgeois nature of the revolution asserted itself.</p>

<p class="fst">Politically, the tasks confronting the Russian Revolution were. 
the destruction of absolutism, the abolition of the feudal nobility as the first 
estate, and the creation of a political constitution and an administrative 
apparatus which would secure politically the fulfillment of the economic tasks 
of the Revolution. The political tasks of the Russian Revolution were, 
therefore, quite in accord with its economic presuppositions, the tasks of the 
bourgeois revolution.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">However, the peculiar historical development of Russia "peculiar" 
in relation to western Europe, that is necessitated that someone other than the 
bourgeoisie carry through the revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The first class characteristic of the Russian Revolution is, 
therefore, the fact that as a bourgeois revolution it had to be carried through 
not only without but directly against the bourgeoisie. Thus arose a fundamental 
alteration of its whole political character.<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">So, despite their characterization of the Russian Revolution as a 
"bourgeois" revolution, in no way did the councilists mean to imply that it was 
of the same nature as the bourgeois revolutions which had occurred in western 
Europe some 100 300 years earlier, although it served the same function. For 
them, the crucial feature of the Russian pre revolutionary social structure was 
the vast size of the peasantry.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> Because of their sheer numbers alone, the 
peasants exerted a tremendous influence on the course of the revolution. "In 
conformity with their over whelming majority, the peasants became the social 
group which at least passively determined the Russian Revolution."<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> The semi 
feudal nature of their exploitation forced the revolution into an anti feudal, 
rather than anti capitalist, direction.</p>

<p class="fst">This is not, however, to deny or minimize the role played by the 
Russian proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">In spite of its backwardness, the Russian proletariat possessed 
great fighting strength, due to the merciless schooling of the combined Czarist 
and capitalist oppression. It threw itself with enormous tenacity Into the 
actions of the Russian bourgeois revolution and became its sharpest and most 
reliable instrument.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Indeed, the activity of the Russian proletariat was the most 
striking feature of the February Revolution and the period between February and 
October.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The social circumstances which determined the consciousness of 
the proletariat and the peasantry were so different that it is hard to imagine 
their developing on their own a common basis for struggle and social 
reorganization. One would expect to see, rather, bitter conflict between these 
classes. However, a group emerged which was able to unite these classes under a 
common banner, a revolution based on "land, bread, and peace." This group which 
came to exert leadership and exercise power developed out of neither class, but 
was the product of the unique historical development of Russian society. "The 
best forces of the Russian intelligentsia stood in the forefront of the 
revolutionary movement, and by their leadership imprinted upon it a petty 
bourgeois, jacobinal stamp."<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> However, although this group the Bolsheviks 
united the revolutionary forces and led them, they themselves were led by the 
necessity of the historical tasks confronting them. That is, in order to 
succeed, to have wide enough support to seize power and wield it, they had to 
articulate the needs and desires of the bulk of the population i.e., above all, 
the peasants.<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> Regardless of any subjective desires to the contrary, the 
Bolsheviks became the instrument of the bourgeois revolution in Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">But the seizure of state power by the Bolsheviks did not give to 
the Revolution the spirit of Lenin; on the contrary, Lenin had so completely 
adapted himself to the necessities of the revolution that, practically, he 
fulfilled the tasks of that class he ostensibly combatted.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus, the Russian Revolution was analyzed by the councilists as a 
bourgeois revolution, circumscribed by the peasantry, sparked by the 
proletariat, and led by the Bolsheviks. It was primarily anti feudal in 
character, and immediately set about the process of industrializing and 
developing capitalism in Russia, although of a unique variety, i.e., "state 
capitalism."<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> The councilists observed this development with great interest, 
and sought to analyze it in depth in order to learn from it.<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a> The Russian 
state never "withered away," growing in fact more powerful both domestically and 
internationally. From the vantage point of the proletariat, this was but another 
form of capitalism. Russian workers still lived by selling their labor power and 
still had no control over the means of production. Moreover, the Bolshevik state 
apparatus took on totalitarian features, suppressing all forms of op position 
and all potential threats to their power. Such behavior began under Lenin<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a> 
and was carried to its logical conclusion by Stalin. The councilists analyzed 
these developments, criticized them, and argued in favor of the struggle against 
them as part of the international struggle for socialism. In September 1939, in 
"The Struggle Against Fascism Begins with the Struggle Against Bolshevism," it 
was argued that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Russia must be placed first among the totalitarian states. It 
was the first to adopt the new state principle. It went furthest in its 
application. It was the first to establish a constitutional dictatorship, 
together with the political and administrative terror system which goes with it. 
Adopting all the features of the total state, it thus becomes the model for 
those other countries which were forced to do away with the democratic state 
system and to change to dictatorial rule. Russia was the example for 
fascism."<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In sum,</p>

<p class="quoteb">"nationalism, authoritarianism, centralism, leader dictatorship, 
power politics, terror rule, mechanistic dynamics, inability to socialize all 
these essential characteristics of fascism were and are existing in Bolshevism. 
Fascism is merely a copy of Bolshevism. For this reason the struggle against the 
one must begin with the struggle against the other."<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Not only did the domestic policy of the Bolshevik state have 
nothing to do with socialism,<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a> but it was apparent that the Third 
International was but a tool in the hands of the Russian Communist Party in 
their efforts to consolidate and maintain their power, rather than a means for 
facilitating world revolution through the self emancipation of the working 
class. "In light of the immediate needs of the bolshevik regime and the 
political ideas of its leaders, the Communist International was not the 
beginning of a new workers' movement, but simply an effort to gain control of 
the old movement and use it to defend the Bolshevik regime in Russia."<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a> Thus, 
"Bolshevism is not only unserviceable as a directive for the revolutionary 
policy of the international proletariat, but is one of its heaviest and most 
dangerous impediments."<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a></p>

<p class="fst">However, the councilist analysis and critique of Bolshevism did 
not stop here. Pannekoek undertook a detailed study of Lenin's philosophy, in an 
effort to understand the bases of Bolshevist ideology, and to demonstrate 
further its inapplicability for the developed capitalist countries of western 
Europe.<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a> This critique took the form of an analysis of Lenin's <i>Materialism 
and Empiriocriticism</i>, which had been written in opposition to a group of 
Russian "Marxists" who had become interested in the philosophical theories of 
Mach and Avenerius. Pannekoek stresses that the point of Lenin's book was not to 
present and analyze the ideas of Mach and Avenerius, but to attack them in such 
a way as to remove the threat to his ideological hegemony within the party.</p>

<p class="fst">Mach and Avenerius formed a danger for the Party; hence what 
mattered was not to find out what was true and valuable in their teachings in 
order to widen our own views. What mattered was o discredit them, to destroy 
their reputation ...<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Pannekoek first analyzes the ideas of these other philosophers 
himself, and then shows how Lenin has misrepresented and misinterpreted them. 
This systematic misrepresentation is attacked by Pannekoek, who firmly believes 
that the proletariat must be allowed to consider all questions practical and 
theoretical on its own. He therefore favors the making available of all points 
of view, so that workers are enabled to decide for themselves what ideas and 
theories have value and which do not. Here we clearly see the contra position of 
councilist libertarianism to Leninist authoritarianism.<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Pannekoek proceeds to consider the very nature of Lenin's 
philosophy itself. He discovers and demonstrates that Lenin's philosophical 
notions are akin to those of bourgeois materialism.</p>

<p class="fst">To Lenin nature and physical matter are Identical, the name 
matter has the same meaning as objective world. In this way he agrees with 
middle class materialism that in the same way considers matter as the real 
substance of the world.</p>

<p class="fst">... for Lenin, "nature" consists not only In matter but also in 
natural laws directing its behavior, floating somehow in the world as commanders 
who must be obeyed by the things. Hence to deny the objective existence of these 
laws means to him the denial of nature itself; to make man the creator of 
natural laws means to him to make human mind the creator of the world.<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The distance between Lenin and Marx Is thus clear. Pannekoek 
points out that the meaning of matter for revolutionary Marxism was that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"man's ideas quite as certainly belong to objective reality as 
the tangible objects; things spiritual constitute the real world just as things 
called material in physics. If in our science, needed to direct our activity, we 
wish to render the entire world of experience, the concept of physical matter 
does not suffice; we eed more and other concepts: energy, mind, 
consciousness."<a href="#n38" name="fn38" target="_self">[38]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lenin failed to understand both Marx and the reality of the 
world, being "entirely captivated by the fetishism of forces as causes, as a 
kind of working imps."<a href="#n39" name="fn39" target="_self">[39]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Pannekoek finds not only the similarity with bourgeois 
materialism in Lenin's conception of matter and nature,<a href="#n40" name="fn40" target="_self">[40]</a> but also in the 
objectives of Lenin's polemic. Rather than attacking idealism as Marx's 
revolutionary materialism did (e.g. <i>The German Ideology</i>), Lenin attacked 
religion and fideism. "This oppositeness of religion to reason is a reminiscence 
from pre Marxian times, from the emancipation of the middle class appealing to 
'reason' in order to attack religious faith as the chief enemy In the social 
struggle."<a href="#n41" name="fn41" target="_self">[41]</a> It thus becomes clear that Lenin's philosophy, rather than being 
the representation of the working class in its anti capitalist struggle, is 
closely connected to the historical situation in Russia, that of the battle 
against feudalism and for the bourgeois revolution.<a href="#n42" name="fn42" target="_self">[42]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus the proletarian class struggle in Russia was at the same 
time a struggle against Czarist absolutism, under the banner of socialism. So 
Marxism in Russia, developing as the theory of those engaged in the social 
conflict, necessarily assumed another character than in Western Europe. It was 
the theory of a fighting working class; but this class had to first fight, and 
foremost, for what in Western Europe had been the function and work of the 
bourgeoisie, with the intellectuals as its associates.<a href="#n43" name="fn43" target="_self">[43]</a></p>

<p class="fst">However, Pannekoek, once again in the best Marxist fashion, 
stresses that Lenin and Bolshevism must not be attacked on a personal level (for 
elitism, betrayal of the working class, etc.) but have to be understood on the 
basis of the social situation in which they struggled.</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin never knew real Marxism. Whence should he have taken it? 
Capitalism he knew only as colonial capitalism; social revolution he knew only 
as the annihilation of big land ownership and Czarist despotism. Russian 
Bolshevism cannot be reproached for having abandoned the way of Marxism; for it 
was never on that way. Every page of Lenin's philosophical work is there to 
prove it; and Marxism itself, by its thesis that theoretical opinions are 
determined by social relations and necessities, makes clear that it could not be 
otherwise. Marxism, however, at the same time shows the necessity of the legend; 
every middle class revolution, requiring working class and peasant support, 
needs the illusion that it is something different, larger, and more universal.<a href="#n44" name="fn44" target="_self">[44]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Through this many faceted analysis, the councilists demonstrated 
that the Russian Revolution was a form of bourgeois revolution rather than a 
socialist revolution.<a href="#n45" name="fn45" target="_self">[45]</a> They recognized and argued that Bolshevism could not 
play a progressive role in proletarian struggles in the developed countries. The 
policies of the Third International could, therefore, only be a hindrance to the 
developing socialist struggle in the advanced capitalist countries.</p>

<p class="fst">The Third International aims at a world revolution after the 
model of the Russian Revolution and with the same goal. The Russian economic 
system is State capitalism, there called state socialism or even communism, with 
production directed by a state bureaucracy under the leadership of the Communist 
Party. The state officials, forming the new ruling class, have the disposal over 
the product, hence over the surplus value, whereas the workers receive wages 
only, thus forming an exploited class ...</p>

<p class="fst">According to CP ideas, a similar revolution is needed in the 
capitalist countries, with the working class again as the active power, leading 
to the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and the organization of production by a 
state bureaucracy. The Russian Revolution could be victorious only because a 
well disciplined united bolshevist party led the masses, and because in the 
party the clear insight and unyielding assurance of Lenin and his friends showed 
the right way. Thus, in the same way, in world revolution, the workers have to 
follow the CP, leave to it the lead and afterwards the government; and the party 
members have to obey their leaders in rigid discipline. Essential are the 
qualified capable party leaders, the proficient, experienced revolutionaries; 
what is necessary for the masses is the belief that the party and its leaders 
are right.<a href="#n46" name="fn46" target="_self">[46]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The councilist objection to this policy is not based on moral or 
ethical criteria (i.e., anti elitism), but is firmly grounded in the historical 
reality of western Europe and America.<a href="#n47" name="fn47" target="_self">[47]</a> There, the task of the working class 
is quite different from the task in Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">In reality, for the working class of developed capitalIsm, in 
Western Europe and America, matters are entirely different, Its task is not the 
overthrow of a backward absolutist monarchy. Its task is to vanquish a ruling 
class commanding the mightiest material and spiritual forces the world has ever 
known. Its object cannot be to replace the domination of stockjobbers and 
monopolists over a disorderly production by the domination of state officials 
over a production regulated from above, Its object is to be itself master of 
production and itself to regulate labor, the basis of life, Only then is 
capitalism really destroyed. Such an aim cannot be attained by an ignorant mass, 
confident followers of a party presenting itself as expert leadership. It can be 
attained only if the workers themselves, the entire class, understand the 
conditions, ways, and means of their fights when every man knows from his own 
judgment what to do. They must, every man of them, act themselves, decide de 
themselves, hence think out and know for themselves.<a href="#n48" name="fn48" target="_self">[48]</a></p>

<p class="fst">For the council communists, therefore, Leninism is antithetical 
to the self emancipation of the working class and thus must be opposed 
theoretically and practically by all genuine radicals in the developed 
countries. The total critique of Leninism Is well grounded in Marx, in terms of 
theory and practice. In 1879, Marx and Engels wrote to Bebel, Liebknecht, and 
others:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"When the International was formed we expressly formulated the 
battle cry: the emancipation of the working class must be the work of the 
working class Itself. We cannot, therefore, cooperate with people who openly 
state that the workers are too uneducated to emancipate themselves."<a href="#n49" name="fn49" target="_self">[49]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is this principle which was foremost in the minds of the 
councilists at all times and guided their theory and practice. Thus, they 
opposed all forms of political activity and all organizations which hindered the 
development of mass self reliance and self confidence. They developed extensive 
critiques of the modes of political activity engaged in by most "leftists".<a href="#n50" name="fn50" target="_self">[50]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>Trade unionism and parliamentary activity</h3>

<p class="fst">Although most "radicals" recognized that trade unions in 
themselves were not revolutionary, they felt that they could be used to further 
the development of "revolutionary consciousness," particularly through the 
diffusion of radical propaganda by their leaders. If this was not the case and 
if often was not the blame was placed on the union leaders, who were "betraying" 
their class and need only be replaced by more radical leaders. The councilists, 
however, developed a far more fundamental critique of trade unions, 
demonstrating that the important question was not that of the behavior of the 
union leaders but of the very structure of the unions and the relationship 
between the unions and the development of capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">The councilists emphasized that trade union activity in itself, 
although it did represent a form of class struggle, had no intentions or 
possibilities of becoming revolutionary, i.e., of aiding in the selfemancipation 
of the working class.</p>

<p class="fst">Trade unionism is an action of the workers which does not go 
beyond the limits of capitalism. Its aim is not to replace capitalism by another 
form of production, but to secure good living conditions within capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">Certainly trade union activity is class struggle. There is a 
class antagonism in capitalism capitalists and workers have opposing interests. 
Not only In the question of the conservation of capitalism, but also within 
capitalism itself, with regard to the division of the total product. The 
capitalists attempt to increase their profits, the surplus value, as much as 
possible, by cutting down wages and increasing the hours or the intensity of 
labor. On the other hand, the workers attempt to increase their wages and to 
shorten their hours of work ... Thus the antagonism becomes the object of a 
contest, the real class struggle. It is the task, the function of the trade 
unions to carry on this fight.<a href="#n51" name="fn51" target="_self">[51]</a></p>

<p class="fst">However, the ability of trade unions to function for the benefit 
of the workers in the long run, in terms of the proletarian revolution, is 
negligible. In fact, they become a hindrance to the working class struggle (even 
on a daily basis) and lose all efficacy for the development of revolutionary 
consciousness. As the unions develop along with capitalism they lose any value 
they might have had in earlier periods and become just another obstacle in the 
path to self emancipation.</p>

<p class="fst">With the growth of capitalism and big industry, the unions too 
must grow. They become big corporations with thousands of members, extending 
over the whole country ... Officials must be appointed: presidents, secretaries, 
treasurers, to conduct the affairs, to manage the finances, locally and 
centrally. They are the leaders, who negotiate with the capitalists and who, by 
this practice, have acquired a special skill. The president of a union is a big 
shot, as big as the capitalist employer himself, and he discusses with him on 
equal terms, the interests of the members. The officials are specialists in 
trade union work, which the members themselves, entirely occupied by their 
factory work, cannot Judge or direct themselves.<a href="#n52" name="fn52" target="_self">[52]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus, a division of labor within the union structure itself 
develops, recreating and reinforcing the capitalist divisions between mental and 
manual labor. The workers lose control over their organization, delegating their 
own powers to the union officials. Many "radicals" have argued that this 
situation in itself need not be bad, especially if the union leaders are 
"radical." The councilists, however, recognized that this recapitulation of the 
division between mental and manual labor was already a large step in the wrong 
direction. Moreover, the ideology of union leaders makes no difference. 
Pannekoek, relying on Marx's notion that consciousness is determined by social 
existence, demonstrates that the behavior of union leaders must not be off 
handedly condemned as "betrayal" but must be understood as a concomitant of the 
social functions they perform.</p>

<p class="fst">The union officials, the labor leaders, are the bearers of the 
special union interests. Originally workmen from the shop, they acquire, by long 
practice at the head of the organization, a new social character. In each social 
group, once it is big enough to form a special group, the nature of its work 
molds its social character, its mode of thinking and acting. Their function is 
entirely different from that of the workers. They do not work in the shop, they 
are not exploited by capitalists, their existence is not threatened continually 
by unemployment. They sit in offices, in fairly secure positions. They have to 
manage corporation affairs and to speak at workers' meetings and discuss with 
employers.<a href="#n53" name="fn53" target="_self">[53]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The union officials identify with the interests and functions of 
the unions. Rather than becoming the leaders of proletarian revolutionary class 
struggle, therefore, they become agents of capitalist social control, which has 
become the primary function of trade unions in developed capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">The labor leaders in advanced capitalism are numerous enough to 
form a special group or class with a special class character and interests. As 
representatives and leaders of the unions they embody the character and 
interests of the unions. The unions are necessary elements of capitalism, so the 
leaders feel as necessary items, as most useful citizens in capitalist society. 
This capitalist function of unions is to regulate class conflicts and to secure 
industrial peace. So labor leaders see it as their duty as citizens to work for 
industrial peace and mediate conflicts. The test of the union lies entirely 
within capitalism; so labor leaders do not look beyond it.<a href="#n54" name="fn54" target="_self">[54]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Pannekoek emphasizes, as the councilists did in every matter that 
they analyzed, that "the conflicts arising here are not anyone's fault, they are 
inevitable consequences of capitalistic development."<a href="#n55" name="fn55" target="_self">[55]</a> Thus, the point is not 
to polemicize against the "betrayal" of the working class by union bureaucrats, 
or to seek their replacement by "radicals,"<a href="#n56" name="fn56" target="_self">[56]</a> but to fight against the unions 
themselves and seek the creation of new structures and organizations which will 
allow for, if not encourage, mass self activity.</p>

<p class="fst">The councilists had no illusions here, however. They did not 
expect the workers to overthrow the unions because they failed to function as 
revolutionary organizations. Rather they recognized that as long as capitalism 
was expanding successfully the workers would remain within the union 
structures.<a href="#n57" name="fn57" target="_self">[57]</a> It is only when the workers find the unions incapable of 
protecting their immediate material interests that they will rebel against them. 
It is through new forms of struggle, spontaneously arising from the necessities 
of the struggle itself, that the workers will seek to act outside the union 
structure and will, of necessity, develop new forms of organization and 
activity. The sit down strikes of the 1930's were such a new form. "It was not 
Invented by theory; it arose spontaneously out of practical needs; theory can do 
no more than afterwards explain its causes and consequences."<a href="#n58" name="fn58" target="_self">[58]</a> Wildcat 
strikes, as well, directed against both capital and trade unions, are 
spontaneous forms of activity stemming from the practical necessities of the 
struggle. Although such strikes are usually limited In scope and are usually 
defeated,</p>

<p class="quoteb">"their importance is that they demonstrate a fresh fighting spirit 
that cannot be suppressed ... They are the harbingers of future greater fights, 
when great social emergencies, with heavier pressure and deeper distress, drive 
the masses to stronger action."<a href="#n59" name="fn59" target="_self">[59]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The experience of solidarity and self management gained in such 
struggles is a crucial step in the direction of revolutionary consciousness, the 
understanding that the working class can on its own direct production and manage 
society collectively. Further, it is the experience that no one but fellow 
workers can be relied upon in times of struggle, that all activity must be 
autonomous and controlled from below by the workers as a collective unit. Thus, 
trade unionism will be defeated, not in theory by intellectuals, but in 
practice, by the workers in the course of struggling to attain their goals in 
the only possible way. This is a necessity of the proletarian struggle for self 
emancipation.</p>

<p class="fst">Bound to an expanding capitalism, totally integrated into the 
whole of the social fabric, the old labor movement can only stagnate with 
stagnating capitalism and decline with declining capitalism. It cannot divorce 
itself from capitalist society, unless it breaks completely with its own past, 
which is possible only by breaking up the old organizations, as far as they 
still exist ... A rebirth of the labor movement is conceivable on as a rebellion 
of the masses against "their" organizations.<a href="#n60" name="fn60" target="_self">[60]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Another form of political activity which many "radicals" have 
considered fruitful is parliamentary politics. Some have argued in favor of the 
"parliamentary path to socialism," i.e., electing socialists to the government 
who will then begin to institute socialism; others have argued that 
parliamentary election campaigns offer a good forum for socialist 
propaganda.<a href="#n61" name="fn61" target="_self">[61]</a> Some, too, have suggested seeking election to parliamentary 
offices and then, once in, trying to expose the sham of bourgeois democracy.</p>

<p class="fst">The council communists, on the other hand, have always maintained 
an anti parliamentary position. Again, this position grows out of their 
understanding of the obstacles and possibilities for proletarian 
self-emancipation in specific historical circumstances (advanced capitalism), 
rather than any abstract moral imperative. A major obstacle to the development 
of the revolutionary consciousness necessary for the selfemancipation of the 
working class is the strength of bourgeois Ideology, which is reinforced by 
parliamentary elections.</p>

<p class="fst">Capitalism is strengthened when its roots, by universal suffrage, 
securing at least political equality, are driven deeper into the working class. 
Workers' suffrage belongs to developed capitalism, because the workers need the 
ballot, as well as trade unions, to maintain themselves in their function in 
capitalism.<a href="#n62" name="fn62" target="_self">[62]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The notion that "socialism" can be introduced through the 
parliamentary process is obviously antithetical to the concept of socialism 
being the process and result of proletarian jelf emancipation. It is clear that 
"parliamentarism cannot bring freedom and mastery to the working class, but only 
new masters instead of the old ones."<a href="#n63" name="fn63" target="_self">[63]</a> Moreover, the nature of the activity 
involved in parliamentary politics can in no way help develop the strength 
necessary to overthrow the capitalist system.</p>

<p class="fst">The conquest of mastery and freedom by the working class will be 
a hard and difficult fight. It is by means of the exigencies of this fight, 
through its sacrifices, its hardships, its dangers, in defeat and victory, that 
the working class must acquire those qualities that make it strong and capable 
for self rule, for ruling society. Can simply putting secretly a name into a 
ballot box be called a fight at all?<a href="#n64" name="fn64" target="_self">[64]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In parliamentary activity, the only strength which the working 
class is called upon to use is its numerical strength, "the least essential only 
of the power factors of the working class."<a href="#n65" name="fn65" target="_self">[65]</a> In no way is the sense of 
solidarity and ability to run society and production at all developed through 
such activity. Indeed, passivity as far as collective activity is concerned is 
encouraged by participation in such activity.<a href="#n66" name="fn66" target="_self">[66]</a> As for the parliamentary 
process or the parliament itself providing a forum for socialist propaganda by 
candidates or legislators, Pannekoek writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The insight needed [for revolution] cannot be obtained as 
instruction of an ignorant mass by learned teachers, possessors of science, as 
the pouring of knowledge into passive pupils. It can only be acquired by self 
education, by the strenuous self activity that strains the brain in felt desire 
to understand the world. It would be very easy for the working class if it had 
only to accept the established truth from those who know it. But the truth they 
need does not exist anywhere in the world outside them; they must build it up 
within themselves."<a href="#n67" name="fn67" target="_self">[67]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In sum, then, any notion, any rationale, for engaging in 
parliamentary activity can only hinder the development of the strengths 
necessary for the destruction of the ideological hegemony of the bourgeoisie. As 
Gorter wrote to Lenin, who had advised taking part in such activity, "the worker 
must struggle alone with his class against the formidable enemy, must bring 
about the most terrible struggle which the world has ever seen. No leadership 
tactic can help this.<a href="#n68" name="fn68" target="_self">[68]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>The role of the Party</h3>

<p class="fst">As for their own principles of organization and activity, the 
council communists presented a theoretical and practical alternative to 
Leninism. They totally rejected the Leninist party form of organization with its 
rigid centralism, hierarchy, strict obedience to leadership, and separation from 
the body of the working class.</p>

<p class="fst">The belief in parties is the main reason for the impotence of the 
working class; therefore, we avoid forming a new party not because we are too 
few, but because a party is an organization that aims to lead and control the 
working class In opposition to this, we maintain that the working class can rise 
to victory only when it independently attacks its problems and decides its own 
fate. The workers should not blindly accept the slogans of others, nor of our 
own groups, but must think, act, and decide for themselves. This conception is 
in sharp contradiction to the tradition of the party as he most important means 
of educating the proletariat.<a href="#n69" name="fn69" target="_self">[69]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The councilists further rejected the party structure because it 
recapitulated the capitalist division between mental and manual labor, between 
order givers and order takers.<a href="#n70" name="fn70" target="_self">[70]</a> With their emphasis on the importance of the 
connection between the means and ends of the class struggle, they recognized 
that socialism workers' self management of production and society cannot be 
achieved through a form of organization that hindered self emancipation. Rather 
than stimulating the capabilities of the workers, parties function to stifle 
them.</p>

<p class="fst">Such parties ... must be rigid structures with clear lines of 
demarcation through membership cards, statutes, party discipline, and admission 
and expulsion procedures. For they are instruments of power they fight for 
power, bridle their members by force and constantly seek to extend the scope of 
their power. It is not their task to develop the initiative of the workers; 
rather do they aim at training loyal and unquestioning members of their faith. 
While the working class in their struggle for power and victory needs unlimited 
intellectual freedom, the party rule must suppress all opinions except its 
own.<a href="#n71" name="fn71" target="_self">[71]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The council communists recognized that building their own 
organization had little relevance to the goal of proletarian self 
emancipation.<a href="#n72" name="fn72" target="_self">[72]</a> Rather, they functioned as a group which shared a general 
common perspective and sought to clarify and publicize the issues of the class 
struggle.<a href="#n73" name="fn73" target="_self">[73]</a> However, they were uncertain of the efficacy of their propaganda, 
due to their conception of the nature of consciousness, i.e., determined by 
social existence in the sense that it arose spontaneously from the necessities 
of practical experience. Pannekoek himself often wavered on this very point, 
holding to different opinions at different times.<a href="#n74" name="fn74" target="_self">[74]</a> In the discussion of the 
role of the "party," he stated that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The struggle is so great, the enemy so powerful, that only the 
masses as a whole can achieve a victory the result of the material and moral 
power of action, unity, and enthusiasm, but also the result of the mental force 
of thought, of clarity. In this lies the great importance of such parties or 
groups based on opinions: that they bring clarity In their conflicts, 
discussions, and propaganda. They are the organs of the self enlightenment of 
the working class by means of which the workers find their way to freedom."<a href="#n75" name="fn75" target="_self">[75]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Whereas in <i>Workers' Councils</i> he holds to a rather 
different conception:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The great decisive step in the progress of mankind, the 
transformation of society now impending, is essentially a transformation of the 
working masses. It can be accomplished only by the action, by the revolt, by the 
effort of the masses themselves; its essential nature is selfliberation of 
mankind. From this viewpoint it is clear that here no able leadership of an 
Intellectual elite can be helpful."<a href="#n76" name="fn76" target="_self">[76]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, Pannekoek never dismisses propaganda as useless, 
believing that at least keeping certain ideas in the air is worthwhile. Mattick 
maintains more closely the practical implications of the council communist and 
what appears to be Marx's conception of consciousness, recognizing the 
limitations of the effect of any propagandistic activity.</p>

<p class="fst">The "consciousness" to rebel against and to change society is not 
developed by the "propaganda" of conscious minorities, but by the real and 
direct propaganda of events; ... So long as minorities operate within the mass, 
the mass is not revolutionary, but neither is the minority. Its "revolutionary 
conceptions" can still serve only capitalistic functions. If the masses become 
revolutionary, the distinction between conscious minority and unconscious 
majority disappears, and also the capitalistic function of the apparently 
"revolutionary" minority.<a href="#n77" name="fn77" target="_self">[77]</a></p>

<p class="fst">All groups which have shared the councilist perspective have been 
caught on the horns of this dilemma. Although most have probably shared 
Mattick's theoretical analysis, they have refused to content themselves with 
either inactivity or internal discussion. Indeed, he has not himself carried out 
the implications of his position, but has engaged in considerable political 
activity and has written voluminously. Different councilist groups have sought 
to resolve this dilemma in different ways. Few have ever been satisfied with 
their tentative solutions.<a href="#n78" name="fn78" target="_self">[78]</a> Nevertheless, all have been united in their 
struggle for the self emancipation of the working class and their unwillingness 
to act as any kind of leadership in the Leninist sense, i.e., formulating policy 
and organizing to seize power.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>The councilist alternative</h3>

<p class="fst">The discussion so far in this chapter should have given some 
indication of how the councilists do see the revolution occurring, if only 
through the process of eliminating unsatisfactory theories. I would now like to 
turn to an explicit description of the councilist conception of the socialist 
revolution and the future free society.</p>

<p class="fst">One of the key notions of council communist theory is that of the 
necessity of severe crisis in order for there to be the possibility of a 
revolutionary situation. Drawing both from Marx's Capital and from their study 
of historical instances of mass upheaval, they concluded that only a crisis 
could force the working class into revolutionary activity.</p>

<p class="fst">Left wing radicalism had been based on what was designated by 
their reformist adversaries as the "politics of catas trophe." The 
revolutionists expected not only deteriorating living standards for the laboring 
population but also economic crises so devastating as to call forth social 
conditions which would, in the end, lead to revolution. They could not conceive 
of revolution short of its objective necessity. And in fact, no social 
revolution occurred except in times of social and economic catastrophe. The 
revolutions released by World War I were the result of catastrophic conditions 
in the weaker imperialist powers and they raised, for the first time, the 
question of workers' control and the actualization of socialism as a real 
possibility.<a href="#n79" name="fn79" target="_self">[79]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The councilists recognized that as Marx pointed out in times of 
growth and stability the control, both material and ideological, of the 
bourgeoisie over the workers is so great as to make a mass based revolution 
impossible. As long as there is no dire necessity to overthrow the system, as 
long as consciousness and reality are in accord, no revolution will occur. This 
notion makes sense theoretically based on an understanding of the essentially 
practical nature of consciousness and historically revolutions have only grown 
out of periods of severe crisis. Mattick summarizes this conception of the 
importance of the crisis in a recently written essay:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"... the history of the workers' movement shows that 
revolutionary class consciousness only manifests itself in times of especially 
deep crisis. Class struggles, which do not tend yet to fix themselves on class 
objectives and do not leave the realm of wage labor, constitute themselves as 
spontaneous reactions to a slow or brutal deterioration of the proletarian 
condition ...</p>

<p class="quoteb">It is only in times of crisis that revolutionary class 
consciousness can develop. By itself, the consciousness of belonging to the 
working class has hardly any importance; in any case, it exists everywhere ... 
The workers know well that they belong to a class antagonistic to that of the 
capitalists ...</p>

<p class="quoteb">When one considers for a moment the enormous strength which 
confronts the proletariat and its class aspirations, one will understand why the 
workers prefer to adapt to the present conditions rather than attack them ...</p>

<p class="quoteb">As long as the ruling class is capable of asserting its political 
power over the economy thanks to a prosperity either true or false it is useless 
to hope that the consciousness of the workers will take a revolutionary 
character. But it is precisely a distinctive trait of capitalism that it finds 
itself incapable of controlling the course of its economic development."<a href="#n80" name="fn80" target="_self">[80]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The councilists rely theoretically on Marx's major work, <i>
Capital</i>, in which he scientifically demonstrated the necessity of capitalist 
crises.<a href="#n81" name="fn81" target="_self">[81]</a> Neither they nor Marx argued that capitalism would break down 
permanently on its own. Rather, the very nature of capitalist production itself, 
based on the contradiction between use value and exchangevalue, generates crises 
of varying severity. It is only in such a period of severe crisis that the 
workers will act to make it the final crisis of capitalism. Until then, 
capitalism will go on, from crisis to expansion to crisis again. Only when the 
working class asserts itself with the totality of its strengths will the true 
breakdown occur.</p>

<p class="fst">The councilists viewed revolutionary consciousness as the <i>
result</i> rather than the precondition for activity in a crisis period.<a href="#n82" name="fn82" target="_self">[82]</a> The 
working class, due to its position in society, and particularly its activity in 
the labor process, recognizes that it is a class opposed to the capitalist 
class. They realize that they are exploited and they struggle daily, through 
union activity, i.e., wage struggles, over their share of their product that 
they are to receive, through sabotage, in which they strike out against their 
domination by capital, by absenteeism, goofing off, etc. However, these 
struggles, although a necessary part of the class struggle, usually do not 
result in an attack on the capitalist system itself. They represent responses to 
daily capitalist domination and exploitation, but they do not transcend 
capitalism as a whole. Rather, they are efforts either to gain a larger share of 
the product for the workers, i.e., raise the price of their labor power, create 
less value for the wages they are paid, or are merely a response to the 
unpleasant nature of work. Revolutionary consciousness subsumes all of this and 
goes a step farther. It is the recognition that the working class as a whole <i>
forms the future communist society in itself</i> within capitalism, i.e., that 
they can run society on their own and restructure it to meet their desires. Such 
a consciousness cannot arise from the daily experience of the labor process 
alone, where workers are under the constant control of others and can only 
exchange their products and cooperate in production through the mediation of 
capitalists, foremen, and the market.<a href="#n83" name="fn83" target="_self">[83]</a> In a crisis, the foundations of this 
system, the regularities of everyday life, begin to crumble, its irrational 
basis becomes apparent for all to see,<a href="#n84" name="fn84" target="_self">[84]</a> and the workers must begin to act on 
their own if they are not to submit to a much more severe exploitation than they 
have ever known. In fact, the existence of an explicit socialist consciousness 
need not, and most likely, cannot, precede the revolutionary class struggle 
itself.</p>

<p class="fst">Even though the workers in great masses may never attain a 
revolutionary consciousness. in order to live they are forced to take up the 
fight against capital. And when they fight for their existence under the 
conditions of the permanent crisis, this fight, regardless of its ideological 
quality, is a fight which can only turn in the direction of overcoming the 
capitalist systemem.<a href="#n85" name="fn85" target="_self">[85]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Revolution is more a matter of necessity than choice. In response 
to growing stagnation and crisis, the capitalists must seek to increase their 
surplus value at all costs, i.e., raise the rate of exploitation a great deal in 
a short time. This in itself begins to elicit responses from the workers. 
Moreover, as they find "their" organizations the trade unions obstacles in the 
way of their protecting their own immediate interests, they <i>must</i> begin to 
act autonomously.</p>

<p class="fst">The depressing tendencies grow stronger under big capitalism and 
so the resistance of the workers must grow stronger too. Economic crises grow 
more and more destructive and undermine apparently secured progress. The 
exploitation is intensified to retard the lowering of the profit rate for 
rapidly increasing capital. So again and again the workers are provoked to 
resistance. But against this strongly increased power of capital the old methods 
of fight no longer can serve. New methods are needed, and before long their 
beginnings present themselves. They spring up spontaneously in the wildcat 
strike, in the direct action.<a href="#n86" name="fn86" target="_self">[86]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is only through forms of mass direct action that the spiritual 
qualities self reliance, solidarity, confidence, creativity can develop which 
are necessary for the overthrow of capitalism and the building of a new society. 
"In the course of strike actions, the ordinary life of workers, in which they 
act under the constant direction of their boss, ceases, and they have to think, 
act, and coordinate their actions for themselves,"<a href="#n87" name="fn87" target="_self">[87]</a> It is through this acting 
for themselves and coordinating their actions with workers in other shops and 
regions (all necessities of the struggle) that the consciousness of the workers 
can undergo a crucial change, attaining the very heart of revolutionary 
consciousness, their "understanding that they have the ability to initiate and 
control action, to make themselves the basic decisions about their lives."<a href="#n88" name="fn88" target="_self">[88]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus, by forcing the workers to act for themselves due to the 
failure of "their" organizations which had acted for them in the past to fight 
off increasing exploitation and to respond to the threat of actual starvation, 
along with the existence of great amounts of unused means of production, masses 
of unemployed workers, a severe crisis can spell the end of capitalism.<a href="#n89" name="fn89" target="_self">[89]</a> The 
crisis itself does not imply the end of capitalism; nor does it necessarily 
cause the appearance of revolutionary consciousness. It forces the workers into 
actions through which revolutionary consciousness may develop. The councilists 
see this as the result of a long process of ever heightening struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">In the course of a long period of conflict, workers form the goal 
of taking over production themselves. This goal develops as a response to two 
conditions that an escalating workers' movement eventually produces. First, the 
workers reach the limit of what they can gain without taking power. This limit 
is generally experienced in the intransigence or counter attack of the old 
rulers, expressed through lockouts, coup d'etats, and the like. The obvious 
solution that presents Itself, therefore, is removing the old rulers from power. 
Second, the workers discover through their own actions their real power and 
ability, and therefore realize that taking over management is possible for 
them.<a href="#n90" name="fn90" target="_self">[90]</a></p>

<p class="fst">However, the council communists <i>never</i> argued that a crisis 
had to result in a revolution. For them, it was a necessary but insufficient 
condition. They recognized that considerable activity undermining bourgeois 
ideological hegemony and laying the basis for new social relationships had to 
reach a high level, not only during the crisis but before it, growing from the 
daily struggle between capitalists and workers, if a successful revolution were 
to make any crisis the final one of capitalism. Gorter saw this, although on a 
very abstract level, in 1920:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Misery in Germany was terrible in the last years of the war. The 
revolution did not come. It was worse yet in 1918 and 1919. The revolution did 
not succeed ... Crisis and misery are not sufficient. The most severe economic 
crisis is here and nevertheless the revolution does not come. There must be 
another factor which brings about the revolution, and which, if it is defeated, 
allows it to fail. This factor is the spirit of the masses."<a href="#n91" name="fn91" target="_self">[91]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Almost all councilists have, however, remained far too abstract 
when confronted with this problem.<a href="#n92" name="fn92" target="_self">[92]</a> Some have merely stated what is necessary 
in a very general way, and then have sought to study society concretely to see 
if any of the necessary activity is going on. For instance <i>Lutte de Classe</i> 
states that "for a revolution to be possible new social relations ought to be 
pre existing, at least in an embryonic state, to overthrow existing 
relations."<a href="#n93" name="fn93" target="_self">[93]</a> They have then devoted much of their efforts to describing and 
analyzing ongoing international working class activity. Pannekoek seems to 
vacillate between stating the problem in general terms and implying that the 
activity of the working class in the struggle itself can overcome all pre 
existing problems. Thus, in <i>Workers' Councils</i> he states in one place 
that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"once, however, they take up the fight, they are changed into new 
personalities; selfish fear recedes to the background and forth spring the 
forces of community, solidarity, and devotion, rousing courage and perseverance. 
These are contagious; the example of fighting activity rouses in others, who 
feel in themselves the same forces awakening, the spirit of mutual aid and of 
self confidence."<a href="#n94" name="fn94" target="_self">[94]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But elsewhere in the book he seems to recognize the difficulties 
involved:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"... the time will come that the evil of depression, the 
calamaties of unemployment, the terrors of war grow ever stronger. Then the 
working class, if not yet revolting, must rise and fight. Then the workers must 
choose between inertly succumbing and actively fighting to win freedom. Then 
they will have to take up their task of creating a better world out of the chaos 
of declining capitalism.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Will they fight? Human history is an endless series of fights, 
and Clausewitz, the well known German theorist on war, concluded from history 
that man is in his inner nature a warlike being. But others, sceptics as well as 
fiery revolutionists, seeing the timidity, the submissiveness, the indifference 
of the masses, often despair of the future. So we will have to look somewhat 
more thoroughly into psychological forces and effects."<a href="#n95" name="fn95" target="_self">[95]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But Pannekoek's investigation in this area is not very thorough. 
Basically, again growing from his understanding of the essentially practical 
nature of consciousness,<a href="#n96" name="fn96" target="_self">[96]</a> he argues that</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the dominant and deepest impulse in man as in every living being 
is his instinct of selfpreservation ... Fear and submissiveness also are the 
effect of this instinct, when against powerful masters they afford the best 
chances for preservation."<a href="#n97" name="fn97" target="_self">[97]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Indeed, in capitalist daily life, this "fear and submissiveness" 
is far more practical than if the worker were to "nurture his feelings of 
independence and pride; the more he suppresses them and tacitly obeys, the less 
difficulty he will encounter in finding and keeping his job."<a href="#n98" name="fn98" target="_self">[98]</a> Here, then, 
is Pannekoek's tentative solution:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"When, however, in times of social crisis and danger all this 
submissivity, this virtuousness, is of no avail to secure life, when only 
fighting can help, then it gives way to its contrary, to rebelliousness and 
courage. Then the bold set the example and the timid discover with surprise of 
what deeds of heroism they are capable. Then selfreliance and high spiritedness 
awake in them and grow. because of their growth depend their chances of life and 
happiness. And at once, by instinct and by experience, they know that only 
collaboration and union can give strength to their masses. When then they 
perceive what forces are present in themselves and in their comrades, when they 
feel the happiness of this awakening of proud self respect and devoted 
brotherhood, when they anticipate a future of victory, when they see rising 
before them the image of the new society they help to build, then enthusiasm and 
ardor grow to irresistible power. Then the working class begins to be ripe for 
revolution. Then capitalism begins to be ripe for collapse."<a href="#n99" name="fn99" target="_self">[99]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Pannekoek seems to be arguing that everything can be solved in 
the revolutionary struggle itself. However, as we have seen. the councilists, 
despite their belief that such a struggle would have to happen regardless of the 
desires of any group or groups, often attacked those organizations and 
institutions which reinforced passivity in the masses. They recognized that the 
stronger such institutions are, the weaker the masses must be. What we have here 
is an immense problem, to my mind the most serious potential inadequacy in 
councilist theory, which merits far more consideration than I can devote to it 
here. I hope to deal with it more thoroughly elsewhere in this thesis. Here I 
must limit myself with having pointed out the nature of the problem, i.e., the 
extent to which conditioning towards passivity can be overcome in the 
revolutionary struggle. Let us move on, perhaps a bit uncomfortably, but with 
determination.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>The functioning of councils in the revolutionary struggle</h3>

<p class="fst">Much of the writing of the council communists concerned the form 
which they thought the struggle of the working class, in the process of its 
selfemancipation, would take. Here, once again, they relied on the analysis of 
historical instances of spontaneous upheavals (particularly Russia in 1905 and 
1917 and Germany in 1918 1923), from which they generalized their theory of 
organizational forms in a revolutionary situation and the importance of those 
forms in the building and the controlling of a new society. As a contemporary 
French group puts it, "the councils are not a dried up scheme, the product of 
some 'brilliant mind' that they have tried to apply by force everywhere, but the 
spontaneous response to the problems which present themselves to the proletariat 
in its struggle against capitalism.<a href="#n100" name="fn100" target="_self">[100]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the councilist discussion of organizational forms, we find 
again the strong emphasis on the relationship of means to ends in the 
revolutionary struggle. All aspects of the revolutionary struggle are 
inextricably connected to the nature of the new society which will be built out 
of this struggle. Organizational forms must, therefore, serve the dual purpose 
of being fighting organs and means of reconstruction. Pannekoek points this out 
in his discussion of forms of organization:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"As the proletariat rises to dominance it develops simultaneously 
its own organization and the forms of the new economic order. These two 
developments are inseparable and form the process of social revolution ... Since 
the revolutionary class fight against the bourgeoisie and its organs is 
inseparable from the seizure of the productive apparatus by the workers and its 
application to production, the same organization that unites the class for its 
fight also acts as the organization of the new productive process."<a href="#n101" name="fn101" target="_self">[101]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Once again, it is stressed that these organizational forms must 
be applicable to the task of the self emancipation of the working class. Thus, 
any form of organization, if it is to be useful in the struggle for socialism, 
must be based on</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the principle of <i>the masses</i> (not party or vanguard) 
retaining power ... Communism cannot be introduced or realized by a party. Only 
the proletariat as a whole can do that ... All the problems of the workers must 
therefore be viewed in relation to the developing self-action of the 
masses."<a href="#n102" name="fn102" target="_self">[102]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus, the two primary requirements of an organizational form are: 
1) that it be equally applicable to the revolutionary struggle and the 
construction of a new society, and 2) that it be a means of direct expression of 
the developing revolutionary consciousness of the working class rather than an 
instrument for controlling them and therefore stifling their initiative.<a href="#n103" name="fn103" target="_self">[103]</a> 
Such an organizational form has appeared every time the working class has taken 
up the direct fight against capital.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not necessary to try to construct or to imagine these new 
forms; they can originate only in the practical fight of the workers themselves. 
They have already originated there; we have only to look into practice to find 
its beginnings everywhere the workers are rebelling against the old order.<a href="#n104" name="fn104" target="_self">[104]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Factory committees and workers' councils are just such forms. 
These organizations arise spontaneously in the course of the struggle. They are 
non hierarchical, concentrating all power in the hands of the workers 
themselves. "Direction in their own hands, also called their own leadership, 
means that all initiative and all decisions proceed from the workers themselves 
... Decision and action, both collective, are one."<a href="#n105" name="fn105" target="_self">[105]</a> Such organs are not 
formed on command, but are the spontaneous modes of expression of the self 
reliance, self determination, and solidarity of the workers in the battle 
against capital. Such spiritual qualities do not arise out of moral exhortation, 
or from reading. Rather, they are the results of the developing struggle it 
self, as they are called forth within each worker and between the workers if the 
struggle is to succeed. Councils are an extremely flexible form of organization, 
capable of meeting the pressing needs of the revolutionary struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">The councils thus appeared as the basic organs of the 
revolutionary movement and they allowed the workers to seize and control the 
forces of production. It is on this basis that they organized their self 
defense. This base could go beyond the narrow confines of the firm and reach out 
to an industrial sector or to the totality of the workers of a city or 
region.<a href="#n106" name="fn106" target="_self">[106]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Already within such councils are embodied new social relations 
cooperation, fundamental equality, solidarity, creativity, self reliance, and 
self confidence. Indeed, they are in part also the means of individual self 
transformation, from the passive, dependent worker of capitalism to the active, 
independent member of a future socialist society. The location of new social 
relations, they are also the location of the self creation of new men and women. 
This is the very nature of organizations such as workers' councils.<a href="#n107" name="fn107" target="_self">[107]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The expression of workers' power, the location of all their power 
in the struggle, the councils represent power of an entirely different nature 
than now exists in capitalist or bureaucratic society. They express the 
exercising of power at the point of production, the factory, in the community, 
at the very heart of the society. This basis of economic power in the factory 
becomes itself the means and expression of political power in the society as a 
whole. Thus, seizing "state power" does not become the aim of the struggle; 
rather, the destruction of the state, of all forms of power which do not emanate 
from below, i.e., are apart from the daily lives of the masses of the 
population.<a href="#n108" name="fn108" target="_self">[108]</a> Indeed, the councils represent the means of moving from a 
society with a powerful state in the traditional sense to a society based on 
proletarian self management of production and of society, with no need for any 
such state apparatus.<a href="#n109" name="fn109" target="_self">[109]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>The functioning of the councils in the new society</h3>

<p class="fst">How would such a society function? All forms of social activity 
the production of goods, the performance of services will be controlled by those 
who engage in them. Thus, there is common ownership of the means of production 
rather than private ownership or "public ownership," as in Russia or other state 
capitalist countries. This difference is rightly stressed by the councilists.</p>

<p class="fst">Common ownership must not be confounded with public ownership. In 
public ownership, often advocated by notable social reformers, the State or 
another political body is master of the production. The workers are not masters 
of their work, they are commanded by the State officials, who are leading and 
directing production. Whatever may be the condition of labor, however human and 
considerate the treatment, the fundamental fact is that not the workers 
themselves, but the officials, dispose of the product, manage the entire process 
... In short, the workers still receive wages, a share of the product determined 
by masters. Under public ownership of the means of production, the workers are 
still subjected to and exploited by a ruling class ... Common ownership by the 
producers can be the only goal of the working class.<a href="#n110" name="fn110" target="_self">[110]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Production in each workplace (be it production of goods or 
services) must be controlled by those who work there.</p>

<p class="fst">The ruling body in each shop organization is the entirety of the 
collaborating workers. They assemble to discuss matters and in assembly take 
their decisions. So everybody who takes part in the work takes part in the 
regulation of the common work.<a href="#n111" name="fn111" target="_self">[111]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In plants too large to assemble all the workers, it will be 
necessary to elect delegates, but these delegates will have no governing power. 
They will be elected from among the work groups, will continue to work there 
i.e., there will be no full time delegates and will be instantly revocable. They 
will not be experts, nor will they be responsible for the running of the 
factory. Rather, their task will be to facilitate discussion and to carry out 
the decisions not the abstract "will" of their fellow workers and to serve also 
as liaisons between work groups within factories and between factories.<a href="#n112" name="fn112" target="_self">[112]</a> 
Delegates will often change, depending on the issues involved. Thus, within the 
factory, the division between order givers and order takers will disappear.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course,</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the organization of the work inside the shop is only one half of 
the task of the workers. Over it, a still more important task, stands the 
joining of the separate enterprises, their combination into a social 
organization."<a href="#n113" name="fn113" target="_self">[113]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Central bodies will be formed on the same basis as councils 
within the factories instantly revocable delegates who continue to work in the 
shops, no decision making powers, i.e., they will be the executors of the 
workers' decisions rather than making decisions for the workers. Such bodies 
will perform the functions of coordination, collection of vital data and 
information, and will see to its dissemination in a simple and comprehensible 
form. They will not be planning bodies. This crucial function of planning will 
be performed by the workers as a whole, who, because of the dissemination of the 
necessary information in understandable form,<a href="#n114" name="fn114" target="_self">[114]</a> will make all the vital 
decisions which their delegates will then make known to the central councils, 
who will then have them publicized.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The councils are no politicians, no government. They are the 
messengers, carrying and interchanging the opinions, the will of the groups of 
workers ... Thus they are the organs of social intercourse and discussion."<a href="#n115" name="fn115" target="_self">[115]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Such councils will serve to facilitate horizontal cooperation 
between factories in the same branch of industry and vertical cooperation 
between factories engaged in different stages of the productive process of a 
given good. Moreover, they will facilitate coordination between consumers' and 
community groups and the factory committees and councils.</p>

<p class="fst">Such a fundamental reorganization of production and society 
implies wide reaching changes in the nature of work and of social life in 
general. The priorities of production on such a basis are the opposite of those 
under capitalism, where the use value of goods is subordinated to their exchange 
value, and production for profit, rather than use and social benefit reigns.</p>

<p class="fst">From the viewpoint of the workers' councils, the statement of the 
problem in matters of economic organization is not as to how production must be 
governed, and in this sense best organized, but as to how the mutual relations 
of human beings to each other and among each other are to be regulated in 
connection with production. For, to the councils, production is no longer an 
objective process in which the labor of man and the product thereof becomes 
separated from him, a process which one directs end computes like lifeless 
material, but to them production is the vital function of the workers 
themselves.<a href="#n116" name="fn116" target="_self">[116]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The division between mental and manual labor, through "the 
reuniting of the functions of decision and execution"<a href="#n117" name="fn117" target="_self">[117]</a> the division between 
the workers and the means of production, between the producers and their 
products, will all disappear. Through the development of the struggle and the 
expansion of new social relations,</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the working class itself in its deepest character is transformed. 
From obedient subjects they are changed into free and self reliant masters of 
their fate, capable to build and manage their new world."<a href="#n118" name="fn118" target="_self">[118]</a></p>

<p class="fst">For them, concomitantly due to their own self transformation and 
the alteration in the structure and nature of the work process, work itself 
comes to be seen less and less as the means to an end it was under capitalism. 
It becomes a form of pleasurable social activity, a means of engaging in useful 
social work and as a part of an interdependent whole which is conscious and 
appreciative of its interdependence. Indeed, "work" will become a fundamental 
though not the only means of self expression.</p>

<p class="fst">Two developments thus become possible in a self managed society. 
One needs to work less and work itself becomes more pleasurable. Significant 
changes in the structure of work, the abolition of the contradictions inherent 
in capitalist production, the development of technology (which has hitherto been 
held back by capitalist motivations and relations of production) to new levels, 
increase the productivity of labor and change the nature of work. Moreover, such 
increases in productivity can now be translated into increased leisure time, 
since the aim of production is measured in use values rather than the quantity 
of surplus value produced.<a href="#n119" name="fn119" target="_self">[119]</a> Once the necessary output has been met, why 
produce more?</p>

<p class="fst">By the rapid increase of the productivity of labor this part, the 
time needed to reproduce all the life necessities, will continually decrease, 
and an increasing part of life will be available for other purposes and 
activities.<a href="#n120" name="fn120" target="_self">[120]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Pannekoek stresses that we must keep in mind the importance of 
the changes in the nature of work itself which will go hand in hand with self 
management. "Whereas the abundance of life necessities, the universal prosperity 
represents the passive side of the new life, the innovation of labor itself as 
its active side makes life a delight of glorious creative experience."<a href="#n121" name="fn121" target="_self">[121]</a> 
Society has been changed from bottom to top, production and social relations 
have been revolutionized, as well as the nature of work. The social causes of 
alienation have been removed.</p>

<p class="fst">One further area of social activity needs to be considered that 
of the distribution of the goods produced. The original councilists' discussion 
of the problem of distribution seems curiously far from Marx's famous dictum: 
"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." Rather 
than basing their presentation on this formula, these councilists sought to 
devise a theoretical system in which both production and distribution were based 
on the same measure average social labor time.<a href="#n122" name="fn122" target="_self">[122]</a> The elaboration of this 
hypothetical system was contained in their publication of the <i>Grundprinzipien 
Kommunisticher Production und Verteilung</i> (Holland, 1930).<a href="#n123" name="fn123" target="_self">[123]</a> As Paul 
Mattick rightly points out in a preface he wrote to the 1970 reprinting of this 
document in French:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"One cannot, however, foresee the real state of the economy after 
the revolution, and consequently it is impossible to construct in advance 
programs and tasks to fulfill in reality. The necessities of tomorrow will 
certainly be the determining factor. What we discuss in advance are the measures 
to take, the instruments to utilize to construct the desired social relations, 
that is to say in this case that interests us, the communist relations between 
people."<a href="#n124" name="fn124" target="_self">[124]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In fact, this publication is probably the most speculative of all 
the councilist writings, the least based on historical instances and tendencies. 
Nevertheless, as Mattick writes, "despite the weakness of the Fundamental 
Principles they remain, yesterday as today, the point of departure for all 
serious discussion and all research on the realization of the communist 
society."<a href="#n125" name="fn125" target="_self">[125]</a> I am highly critical of their notion that in a communist society 
the distribution of goods will be based primarily on the amount of time that a 
person works. Although they also allowed for the creation of a special fund of 
goods for those who can't work, i.e., because they are too old, too young, or 
physically incapable, there seems to be a disregard on their part of the 
possibility of distribution according to need. This document seems to contradict 
the above cited statement that in a communist society, the approach to economics 
and related problems would be seen primarily in terms of human needs and 
desires,<a href="#n126" name="fn126" target="_self">[126]</a> because there is an over emphasis on calculation without a concern 
for distribution according to need.</p>

<p class="fst">If the capitalist methods of calculation rest on the universal 
domination of money, the disappearance of money and of the market in the 
communist society does not however suppress the necessity for calculation. To 
socially regulate production and distribution, it is indispensable to have a 
universal standard, a unity of calculation.<a href="#n127" name="fn127" target="_self">[127]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The bulk of their presentation is thus an elaborate scheme of 
production and distribution based on calculations according to social average 
labor time, working out relations between the sectors of goods production and 
service production, accumulation and reproduction, and so on. Their fundamental 
notion of self management remains and is basic to their conception of production 
under socialism, but most of the rest of their discussion in this publication is 
unacceptable to me. Other councilists have recognized the weaknesses and 
inadequacies of these ideas concerning distribution and have not hesitated to 
criticize them.</p>

<p class="fst">The authors of the 'Fundamental Principles" are right to insist 
on the fact that the producers have the right to dispose of their production, 
but it is something else again to affirm that this right of disposition should 
be exercised by the intermediary of a distribution based on the equality of 
labor time.<a href="#n128" name="fn128" target="_self">[128]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Despite the weaknesses in this particular document, we must grasp 
the value of council communist theory. Their fundamental notions have great 
relevance to "radicals" today, such as the relationship of means to ends in 
political activity, the importance of the notion of the class struggle as the 
self emancipation of the working class, the necessity of crisis for there to be 
revolutionary activity, their theory of revolutionary consciousness, and finally 
their notions of the new society, based not on a utopian vision but on 
generalizations from the historical experience of working class struggles in the 
20th century. Throughout, save for their discussion of the bases for 
distribution, they represent a continuation of the essence of Marx's thought: 
analyses of tendencies existing within contemporary society, the self 
emancipation of the working class as a fundamental guiding principle, the new 
society as the "association of free and equal producers," the theory of crisis, 
the theory of consciousness, etc. Nevertheless, we should keep In mind that 
their primary concern was to analyze society in order to help change it, rather 
than be true to Marx. Perhaps the similarity of their theoretical conclusions to 
Marx's results from the remarkable insight with which he had analyzed society 
some fifty years before.</p>

<h3>Footnotes:</h3>
<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1]</a> A discussion of the formation and functioning of workers' 
councils and factory committees in Russia and Germany is presented in Chapters 
VI and VII of this thesis. Pannekoek writes about the formation of their ideas: 
"This new organization of labor, we have to investigate and to clarify to 
ourselves and to one another, devoting to it the best powers of our minds. We 
cannot devise it as a fantasy; we derive it from the real conditions and needs 
of present work and present workers." <i>Workers' Councils</i>, p. 18. A 
contemporary French councilist group points out that the experience of Russia 
and Germany has been repeated elsewhere since then. "Since that time, each time 
that the proletariat has itself attacked capitalism, it has organized itself in 
workers' councils; they reappeared in 1920 in Italy, in 1927 in China, in 1936 
in Spain, in 1953 in Fast Germany, in 1956 in Poland and Hungary ...". <i>
Revolution Internationale</i>, No. 1, "Le Pouvoir des Conseils Ouvriers," 
December, 1978, P 15.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n2" href="#fn2">[2]</a> Their adherence to Marx, certainly in a non dogmatic way, 
distinguishes them from most groups which have, in posing alternatives to 
Marxism Leninism and state capitalism, rejected a large body of Marx's thought. 
See, for example, Paul Cardan, <i>History and Revolution: A Revolutionary 
Critique of Historical Materialism</i> or Murray Bookchin, <i>Post-Scarcity 
Anarchism</i>. Stanley Aronowitz writes of the councilists that "taking their 
cue from the works of Marx himself, they argued that the distinguishing feature 
of 'he proletariat is its capacity for self-organization and self management." 
"Left Wing Communism: The Reply to Lenin," in Howard and Klare, eds., <i>The 
Unknown Dimension</i>, P. 178.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n3" href="#fn3">[3]</a> In this notion they are far closer to Marx than the dogmatic 
Marxist Leninists who strive to apply fixed social and economic categories and a 
predetermined model of revolutionary organization on all societies. Lenin 
himself set such a precedent for his followers in his attempts to impose 
particular political activities on the international left. See the discussion 
below concerning Lenin's <i>Left Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder</i> and 
Gorter's <i>Response to Lenin</i>.</p>

11.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> The K.A.P.D., for whom Gorter theorized the activity in his <i>
Reponse a Lenine</i> still conceived its role as that of a vanguard organized 
outside of the masses (to enlighten them and not to lead them in the Leninist 
sense). But this conception was itself surpassed by some ultra Leftists opposed 
to the duality of party/factory organizations; revolutionaries should not seek 
to come together in special organizations distinct from the masses." <i>

conference, "Sur l'ideologie ultragauche," p. 29.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n15" href="#fn15">[15]</a> It is through notions such as this that it becomes apparent 
how similar the councilists were to Marx in the way they analyzed social 
situations. Marx, in the Preface to the first German edition of <i>Capital</i>, 
wrote: "My standpoint, from which the evolution of the economic formation of 
society is viewed as a process of natural history, can less than any other make 
the individual responsible for relations whose creature he socially remains ... 
" <i>Capital</i>, Vol. I, p. 10. Councilist analyses of political behavior have 
always reflected this conception.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n16" href="#fn16">[16]</a> Theses on Bolshevism," <i>International Council 
Correspondence</i>, No. 3, December 1934, thesis #7, P. 3. Probably the most 
succinct and valuable analysis of the socio economic condition of Russia prior 
to 1917 can be found in Trotsky, <i>The History of the Russian Revolution</i>, 
Vol. I, Chapter I, "Peculiarities of Russia's Social Development."</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n19" href="#fn19">[19]</a> Gorter emphasized this point in 1920. "The revolution in 
Russia won through the aid of the poor peasants. This should be kept in mind in 
Western Europe and throughout the world." <i>Op. cit</i>., P. 17. Gorter pointed 
out that there were but 7 8 million proletarians in a population of 160,000,000 
(p. 20). In comparison to other analyses of the Russian social and economic 
conditions, Gorter's numerical estimate seems rather generous. Cf. Trotsky, <i>
op. cit.</i>, Chapter II, "The Proletariat and the Peasantry."</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n21" href="#fn21">[21]</a> <i>Ibid.</i>, thesis #15, p. 4. In fact, large segments of 
the proletariat rose spontaneously both in 1905 and 1917. However, the 
councilists never argued as, for example, Maurice Brinton does in <i>The 
Bolsheviks and Workers' Control</i> that the Russian masses could have actually 
built a socialist system out of the existing economic situation.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n22" href="#fn22">[22]</a> In 1954, Pannekoek wrote in a letter to Cardan: "The Russian 
Revolution ... seemed to be a proletarian revolution, the workers being the 
authors by their strikes and their mass actions. Afterwards, however, the 
bolshevik party succeeded little by little in appropriating the power (the 
working class was a small minority of the population); thus the bourgeois 
character of the Russian Revolution became dominant and took the. form of state 
capitalism." <i>Socialisme ou Barbarie</i>, Vol. IV, No. 14, April June, 1954, 
p. 41.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n24" href="#fn24">[24]</a> "... the Russian Revolution was not dependent on Lenin or on 
the Bolsheviks, but ... the decisive element in it was the revolt of the 
peasants. It was not Lenin who conducted the revolution, but the revolution 
conducted him." "The Lenin Legend," <i>International Council Correspondence</i>,

<p class="endnote"><a name="n26" href="#fn26">[26]</a> "It [the Russian Revolution] was, in a few words, the last 
bourgeois revolution, but which was the work of the working class. Bourgeois 
revolution signifies a revolution which destroys feudalism and opens the path to 
industrialization with all the social consequences that this implies. The 
Russian Revolution is thus in the line of the English Revolution of 1647 and the 
French Revolution of 1799, with those following in 1830, 1848, and 1871." 
Pannekoek, letter, <i>op. cit</i>., p. 40.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n27" href="#fn27">[27]</a> "The experience of bolshevism can serve us as a lesson in 
order to know how socialism cannot be realized. Control of the means of 
production, private property transferred to the State, central and antagonistic 
direction of production and distribution leave intact the capital labor 
relationship as well as the relationship between exploiters and exploited, 
masters and subjects. This development leads only to a more modern form of 
capitalism, where capital is not indirectly but directly the collective property 
of a dominant class with a political base." Paul Mattick, "Anton Pannekoek," <i>

point in <i>Workers' Councils</i>, while also pointing out the fundamental 
difference between Bolshevism and Fascism. "The similarity of political forms 
and methods in Russia and Germany strikes the eye at first sight. In both the 
same dictatorship of a small group of leaders, assisted by a powerful, well 
organized and disciplined party, the same omnipotence of the ruling bureaucracy, 
the same absence of personal rights and of free speech, the same levelling of 
spiritual life into one doctrine, upheld by terrorism, the same cruelty towards 
opposition or even criticism. The economic basis, however, is different. In 
Russia it is state capitalism, in Germany state directed private capitalism." P. 
201.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n31" href="#fn31">[31]</a> "What is named state socialism discloses itself as state

position is his notion "that the militant character of a revolutionary 
materialist theory can and must be maintained against the weakening influences 
of other apparently hostile theoretical tendencies by any means to the exclusion 
of modifications made imperative by future scientific criticism and research. 
This fallacious conception caused Lenin to evade discussion on their merits of 
such new scientific concepts and theories that in his judgment jeopardized the 
proved fighting value of that revolutionary (though not necessarily proletarian 
revolutionary) materialist philosophy that his Marxist party had adopted, less 
from Marx and Engels than from their philosophical teachers, the bourgeois 
materialists from Holbach to Feuerbach and their idealist antagonist, the 
dialectical philosopher Hegel. Rather he stuck to his guns, preferring the 
immediate utility of a given ideology to its theoretical truth in a changing

<p class="endnote"><a name="n42" href="#fn42">[42]</a> Lenin's Marxism did not express the practical necessities of 
the modern international anti capitalist class struggle, but was determined by 
conditions specific to Russia. Russia required not so much the emancipation as 
the creation of an industrial proletariat, and not so much the end of capital 
accumulation as its acceleration ... Lenin's Marxian 'orthodoxy' existed only in 
ideological form, as the false consciousness of a non socialist practice." Paul

the <i>proletarian</i> class - Marxism in Russia was from the start nothing more 
than an ideological form assumed by the material struggle for putting across the 
capitalist development in a pre-capitalist country ...Yet on this new soil the 
bourgeois principle could not make use, once again, of those historically 
outworn illusions and self deceptions with which it had concealed from itself 
the restricted bourgeois content of its developmental struggles in its first 
herioc phase in the West ...For penetration into the East, it needed a new 
ideological costume. And it was just the Marxist doctrine taken over from the 
West which seemed to be most able to render the growing bourgeois development in 
Russia that important historical service." "The Marxist Ideology in Russia," <i>

unions, the organization of workers within the structure of capitalism, once 
seen as a means for the liberation of the working class, have turned into their 
opposite, a means for accelerated capital accumulation and hence greater control 
over the workers. "The possibility. under conditions of a progressive capital 
formation, of improving labor conditions and of raising the price of labor, 
transformed the workers' struggle into a force for capitalist expansion. Like 
capitalist competition, the workers' struggle served as an incentive for further 
capital accumulation; it accentuated capitalist 'progress.' All gains of the 
workers were compensated for by an increasing exploitation, which in turn 
permitted a still more rapid capital expansion." Mattick, "Karl Kautsky: From 
Marx to Hitler," <i>Living Marxism</i>, Vol. IV, No. 7. June 1937, P. 195.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n57" href="#fn57">[57]</a> "As long as capitalism is able to expand farther over the 
world and to increase its volume, it can give employment to the mass of the 
population. As long as thus it meets the first demand of a system of production, 
to procure a living to its members, it will be able to maintain itself, because 
no dire necessity compels workers to make an end of It." Pannekoek, <i>Workers'

that the class fight between capital and labor cannot cease, and that when the 
old forms are not practicable any more, the workers spontaneously try out and

revolt against the old organizational forms." Pannekoek, "General Remarks on the 
Question of Organization," <i>Living Marxism</i>, Vol. IV, No. 5, November 1938, 
p. 147. Pannekoek later wrote: "Wildcat strikes are spontaneous outbursts, the 
genuine practical expression of class struggle against capitalism, though 
without wider aims as yet; but they embody a new character already in the 
rebellious masses: selfdetermination instead of determination by leaders, self 
reliance instead of obedience, fighting spirit instead of accepting the dictates

imposed by membership." "The Failure of the Working Class," <i>Politics</i>,

production just as the capitalist class was an unnecessary third factor to the 
two needed for the carrying on of social life: means of production and labor.

struggles do not tend towards a socialistic goal. Socialism finally means 
nothing more than the elimination of that third factor that stands between the 
means of production and labor." In <i>ibid.</i>, p. 16.</p>

In "Five Theses on the Class Struggle" (reprinted as an appendix to a Root and

can be won by the working class only through their own organized action, by 
taking their lot in their own hands, in devoted exertion of all their faculties, 
by directing and organizing their fight and their work themselves by means of 
their councils. For the parties there remains the second function, to spread 
insight and knowledge, to study, discuss, and formulate social ideas, and by 
their propaganda to enlighten the minds of the masses. The workers' councils are 
the organs for practical action and the fight of the working class; to the 
parties falls the task of the building up of its spiritual power. Their work 
forms an indispensable part in the self liberation of the working class."</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">- that following the concentration of firms, many workers have 
common interests and they discover this when a limited sector is fighting;</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">- that the sectors are so interdependent that stopping a few 
blocks them all;</p>

<p class="endnote" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">- that the resistance of the leaders to whatever touches their 
decisionmaking power rapidly pushes the struggle into an impasse and forces the 
striking workers to seek other support. The autonomy of the struggle does not 
come so much from the initial refusal of the union leaders or delegates to 
support a strike, but rather from the fact that their position in the modern 
enterprise renders them absolutely unable to regulate the problems of the base 
and that they intervene in the struggle to exercise a function, the union 
function, totally opposed to the workers' interests ...". "La Lutte de Classe en 
France," <i>Informations Correspondence Ouvriere</i>, #85, September 1969, P. 3.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n92" href="#fn92">[92]</a> Of course, there is a rather clear connection between 
uncertainty on this problem and the uncertainty concerning the group's activity 
which was discussed earlier in this chapter.</p>

same general perspective, analyzes the French situation in the same basic terms: 
"This feeling of powerlessness is normal. It will disappear to the degree that 
the incapacity of the capitalist class in the face of the economic crisis in 
which all the industrialized countries are entering will reveal itself." <i>Noir

come to fruition is an indication of the complex nature of this problem.</p>

different organization and behavior. (Cf. <i>On the Transition to Socialism</i>,

neatly conceived plan of action by a staff of able leaders. They are a people 
gradually rising out of submissiveness and ignorance, gradually coming to 
consciousness of their exploitation, again and again driven to the fight for 
better living conditions, by degrees developing their powers. New feelings 
spring up in their hearts, new thoughts arise in their heads. New wishes, new 
ideals, new aims fill their minds and direct their will and action. Their aims 
gradually begin to take a more concise shape. From the simple strife for better 
working conditions, in the beginning, they grow to the idea of a fundamental 
reorganization of society." <i>Workers' Councils</i>, pp. 17-18.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n107" href="#fn107">[107]</a> "One of the essential conditions of the revolution is thus 
the organization of the masses in the form which can immediately and directly 
translate their consciousness in actions ... Only the councils, because they 
bring together all the workers and because they exercise their power over all 
the life of society in each factory, quarter, region, can respond to this 
fundamental need. They alone can assure the effective and immediate 
participation of all the workers; they alone can guarantee the rapidity of the 
realization of the initiatives of the revolutionary class." <i>Revolution

<p class="endnote"><a name="n108" href="#fn108">[108]</a> " The expropriation of the capitalists implies the

<p class="endnote"><a name="n109" href="#fn109">[109]</a> "With a system of factory committees and workers' councils 
extending over wide areas the proletariat creates the organs which regulate 
production, distribution, and all the other functions of social life. In other 
words, the civil administrative apparatus is deprived of all power, and the 
proletarian dictatorship establishes itself, Thus, class organization in the 
very struggle for power is at the same time organization, control, and 
management of the productive forces and of the entire society. It is the basis 
of the association of free and equal producers and consumers." "The Masses and

instantly revocable, having simply a power of execution of the directive taken 
in informed assemblies, are thus the very form which permits all men to manage 
their activity, their production. They constitute not an organ destined to 
impose on a majority the directives of a minority, but the organization of the 
great majority to coordinate and effectively run its actions and its desires." <i>

"Direct democracy gives an idea of the <i>decentralization</i> which socialist 
society will be able to achieve. But an industrially advanced free society will 
also have to find a means of democratically integrating these basic units into 
the social fabric as a whole. It will have to solve the difficult problem of the 
necessary <i>centralization</i>, without which the life of a modern community 
would collapse." <i>Workers' Councils and the Economics of a Self Managed 
Society</i>, p. 14.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n115" href="#fn115">[115]</a> "The councils are no government; not even the most central 
councils bear a governmental character. For they have to means to impose their

management is not just a new administrative technique. It cannot remain external 
to the structure of work itself. It doesn't mean keeping work as it is and just 
replacing the bureaucratic apparatus which currently manages production by a 
workers' council however democratic or revocable such a council might be. It 
means that for the mass of people new relations will have to develop with their 
work and about their work. The very <i>content</i> of work will immediately have 
to change." <i>Op. cit.</i>, P. 17.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n119" href="#fn119">[119]</a> "In communism, production is no longer a process of capital 
expansion, but only a labor process in which society draws from nature the means

<p class="endnote"><a name="n122" href="#fn122">[122]</a> They had no feeling that they were going against the grain 
of Marx's thought when they dealt with distribution. Indeed, they considered 
their ideas to be based on <i>Capital</i> and <i>The Critique of the Gotha 
Programme</i>. Pannekoek wrote later that "the G.I.K. [the Dutch council 
communist group] in studying the problem, the main problem of Socialism, of how 
to combine freedom with organization, perceived that they had only to continue 
along the line of thought laid down by Marx in occasional small notes in <i>
Capital</i> and in his remarks on the Gotha Programme of the German Social 
Democrats." "The Crisis in Socialist Theory," <i>Left</i>, #132, October 1947,
