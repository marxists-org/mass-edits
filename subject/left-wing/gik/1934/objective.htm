<h1>Objective</h1>
<h3>1934</h3>
<hr>

<p class="fst">The capitalist development leads to more and more violent crises, 
which expresses themselves in a steadily increasing unemployment and a still 
deeper shaking of the economy. Through this millions of workers are shut out 
from production and abandoned to starving. At the same time the divisions 
between the various capitalist countries are deepening towards a point where the 
competition, that is already an economical war, will result in a new World War.</p>

<p class="fst">The continuous impoverishment and the growing uncertainty 
concerning the mere existence forces the working class to fight for the 
communist mode of production. In these fights the Groups of International 
Communists encourage the workers to take the administration and management of 
production and distribution into their own hands following generally valid 
social rules in order to realize the 'association of free and equal producers'.</p>

<p class="fst">The G.I.C. sees the development of the workers' 
self-consciousness as the essential progress of the workers' movement. Therefore 
they oppose the leader-policies of the parliamentarian parties and of the trade 
unions and maintains as watchwords for the struggle:</p>

<p class="fst">ALL POWER TO THE WORKERS' COUNCILS!<br>
THE PRODUCTION IN THE HANDS OF THE ENTERPRISE ORGANIZATIONS!</p>
