<p>In the first days of July, the Dutch Government cut the unemployed (cash) 
relief to an extent which aroused the unemployed to spontaneous demonstrations 
at the relief stations and on the streets. These demonstrations were at once 
combatted by the police and the guardsmen in the most brutal manner. In the 
&#8220;Indian District&#8221; and the &#8220;Jordaan Workers District&#8221; of Amsterdam the unemployed 
did not allow the police to break their demonstrations up without a fight. They 
answered the bullets and sabers of the police with the stones they got from the 
pavement. The struggle lasted many hours. In the evening after the workers left 
for group meetings which had been hastily arranged, these groups in passing 
through the streets grew in a very short time to powerful and large 
demonstrations which the police again tried to break up. The workers erected 
barricades to keep the police out of the streets, as it is impossible to defeat 
bullets with stones. The street lights were destroyed in order to make it 
difficult for the police to advance. This, which was done in a few streets 
became the situation in the whole &#8220;Jordaan District&#8221; the next day. At all 
corners hastily but well erected barricades were seen; the streets were torn up 
to exclude all fast transportation. On this day the workers succeeded in driving 
every policeman out of the district which by evening was entirely in the hands 
of the workers. The unemployed were victorious for this day; but, by twelve 
o'clock at night they all returned to their homes and the police moved in again 
without a fight.</p>

<p>On the following day the guardsmen took possession of the district. They came 
with tanks, armored automobiles and machine guns. They arrived in such a 
strength that the unemployed alone could never be able to fight them 
successfully. They were not cowardly in not opposing the guardsmen because the 
events of the day before had brought proof that they were good fighters. 
However, in the face of this strong enemy, a fight would have been suicide.</p>

<p>The struggle had grown out of a relief question. The immediate goal of the 
fighters was to force the government to recall the relief cut. Workers who want 
to fight the government at least need the support of very broad layers of the 
working class. This support was not forthcoming. The majority of the workers 
will only participate in a movement which embraces <em>their</em> immediate 
interests. But the fight was merely a fight for unemployed relief; it did not 
involve the employed workers. Without their support, there was no sense to go 
farther in the struggle, and it ended in a defeat.</p>

<p>The relief cut was an absolute necessity for the Dutch bourgeoisie. The wages 
of the employed workers had become so low by a series of wage cuts that there 
was almost no difference any more between the relief and the wages; but before 
further wage cuts could be made, the relief had now to be cut first. The 
continuation of the profitableness of the capitalistic system made this 
absolutely necessary. This is why the government answered a simple demonstration 
of the unemployed in a way in which formerly only revolutionary uprisings would 
have been answered. It was martial law. This offensive against the unemployed 
was a challenge against the whole working class. There could only be one answer 
after the brutal attack of the police and the guardsmen: &#8220;The General Strike&#8221;; 
but the trade-unionist traditions made it hardly possible. It is important to 
note that in factories not controlled by the trade union, the workers walked out 
in sympathy with the unemployed.</p>

<p>As bitter as the battle was, which the unemployed put up and which spread as 
a guerilla warfare all over the city, in a few days the whole thing was crushed. 
After the defeat of the uprising, the attack against the existing labor 
organization set in. In all labor organizations, such as press bureaus, offices, 
etc., the police searched for documents, stole the important parts of the 
printing presses, put many workers in jail, forbade every kind of workers&#8217; 
activity. Although this may hurt the labor organization very much, it is not bad 
at all from the viewpoint of the actual class struggle of the <em>working class</em>. 
The fighting strength of the workers actually increases through such measures of 
the ruling class. To forbid the class struggle itself is impossible, but if the 
bourgeoisie makes the existence of the pseudo-revolutionary organizations 
impossible, it also removes at the same time an obstacle against the real 
revolutionizing of the workers. The workers cannot merely be neutralized by the 
labor fakers; they have to find their own way. Their labor becomes more 
difficult to be sure, but also more effective. What they now do is to actually 
fight and not engage in some opportunistic sidetracking of the real issue in the 
fields of parliamentary fake-success, etc.</p>

<p>The greatest value for the revolutionary movement is the fact that actions of 
this kind, and the actions of the ruling class which followed them, showed the 
weaknesses of the present day labor movement in all its ugliness. One stroke of 
the ruling class sufficed to do away with the Communist Party and all its 
affiliated organizations. The leadership of the C.P. had not anticipated this, 
and actually, the bourgeoisie had really no reason to be so hard on this 
organization which, in spite of all their self-assurance, is only trying to live 
and prosper inside of the capitalistic system. Even the last number of the 
Communist Party of Holland&#8217;s paper, the &#8220;Tribune&#8221;, before it was suppressed, 
tried to support the system of private property. We read therein regarding the 
action of the unemployed (&#8220;Tribune&#8221; - July 6), &#8220;<em>Fight Against Looting and 
Provocations</em>&#8221;:</p>
<p class="quote">&#8221;When the workers in the Jordaan District were fighting a mass 
battle, some criminal elements were trying to loot the stores. The workers have 
nothing in common with these elements. They have to fight them. The workers want 
the sympathy and the support of many small business men in Jordaan. They, like 
the workers themselves, are hit hard by the depression and also by the relief 
cut&#8221;.</p>
<p>(By the way: The lootings hit the firm &#8220;Jamin&#8221;, a big capitalistic enterprise 
in foodstuffs, a chain store.)</p>
<p>The C.P. also advised the workers in order to combat the military onslaught 
of the ruling class to engage in such silly things as to organize &#8220;school 
strikes,&#8221; &#8220;don&#8217;t pay rent movements&#8221;, etc.; but not a single word of the only 
thing which was logically necessary, &#8220;The General Strike&#8221;.</p>

<p>The most important lesson to be drawn from the struggle of the unemployed in 
Amsterdam is the fact that successful group struggles are no longer possible. 
The difficulties in which the bourgeoisie finds itself, not only in regard to 
their diminished profits in this country but in their extended necessity to 
compete on the world market and thus prepare for the imperialistic actions, 
forces them to make of the workers not only paupers, but also willing tools in 
the hands of the ruling class. They are unable to stand even the weakest 
opposition on the part of the workers, and each demonstration against the policy 
of the bourgeoisie is translated by the ruling class as a direct menace against 
its existence.</p>

<p>What took place when the sailors of &#8220;De Zeven Provincien&#8221; revolted was 
repeated with this demonstration of the unemployed. The sailors demonstrated 
against their miserable condition, but they were treated as though they had 
started a revolution. So again the &#8220;Handelsblaad&#8221; of July 5 writes: &#8220;Whosoever 
is building barricades in the City will be answered as it is the custom to 
answer when barricades are built&#8221;.</p>

<p>The brutality with which the bourgeoisie answered even the slightest protest 
of the workers comes actually as a surprise to these workers. They did not even 
understand this at first. The sailors of &#8220;De Zeven Provincien&#8221; looked up to the 
army planes, and laughing, they never thought that these army planes would drop 
bombs to destroy the rebels. The workers of Amsterdam did not dream that a mere 
demonstration would turn the city into a battle field, with military tactics, 
barricades and killings; but they learn and they learn fast as their action 
proves. They will soon know that not even the weakest activity will be granted 
to them; that the ruling class is deadly serious in their determination to kill 
all actions in favor of the working class.</p>

<p>The period of &#8220;Democracy&#8221;, of &#8220;Parliamentary Humbug&#8221;, of &#8220;Reforms&#8221; and of 
&#8220;Legal Action&#8221; is definitely over. Now machine guns make history, and realizing 
this new situation, the workers will also find out that it is absolutely 
necessary to adopt a class policy, and that success is only possible if the 
present system is destroyed through proletarian revolution.</p>
