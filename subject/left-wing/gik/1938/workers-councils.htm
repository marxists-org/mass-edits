<h4>Group of International Communists</h4>
<h1>The Origins of the Movement for Workers' Councils in Germany</h1>
<h3>1938</h3>

<hr>

<p class="information">The pamphlet produced here in English was first published 
in Dutch in <i>Radencommunismus</i> No. 3 1938, the journal of the Council 
Communist Group of Holland, and later translated into French and published in <i>
Internationalisme</i> No. 45 1952. It was finally published in the 1970s by the
<i>Workers Voice</i> group in Liverpool. For some of us who were beginning to 
discover revolutionary politics at the time it was an important text. It 
confirmed our hostility to the parties of the Third International and gave a new 
understanding of just how anti-working class social democracy was and is. Most 
importantly, we found new evidence that the working class is quite capable of 
developing mass, non-leadership organisations with revolutionary goals.</p>

<h2><a name="h1">Preface</a></h2>

<p class="fst">We are reprinting this pamphlet firstly, because despite the 
myriad's of publications that now claim to represent a 'continuity' with the 
German Left of the period, this history is still unknown to generations of 
workers.</p>

<p class="fst">Secondly, the arguments it debates and the issues it raises are 
still unresolved, and can only begin to be resolved by making this history 
better known. Despite the best (and worst) efforts of some, these issues cannot 
be resolved theoretically nor in advance.</p>

<p class="fst">Thirdly, it is timely because we are publishing it at a time when 
many militants are disorientated and demoralised by the prospect of continuing 
Tory rule in Britain. The implication being that all should 'rally' behind 'one 
more push' to get a Labour Government re elected.</p>

<p class="fst">One of the main reasons for publishing this pamphlet originally 
was to show how reactionary Social Democracy was in 1918 (the year Clause 4 was 
written) in immediately using the power of the old workers movement to stabilise 
society, to preserve that society from the new working class forces which were 
emerging to challenge the capitalist way of doing things.</p>

<p class="fst">Nothing that has happened in the intervening years has caused us 
to revise our opinion of Social Democracy in general and the Labour Party in 
particular. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a Labour Government 
could be elected again. If it doe s happen, our view is that it will be because 
our present rulers have lost their way and can no longer hold together. Nothing 
the Labour Party can do will change its essential nature as saviour of the 
capitalist system; as such it can hardly have a mass appeal for the working 
class. Nor has this party a superior understanding of the crisis at present 
working its way through modern institutions.</p>

<p class="fst">But, the Labour Party understands only too well its role as a 
stabilising, conservative force within society, seeking at all costs (along with 
its paymasters in the trade unions) to prevent the emergence of any tendency 
within the working class which seeks to break out of the straitjacket of 
Parliamentary politics and trade unionism.</p>

<p class="fst">It was a popular pamphlet when we first published it and now we 
have managed to catch up with capitalist technology, it is also easier for us to 
reproduce it. We hope it will prove popular again.</p>

<p class="fst">We have not found it necessary to alter the original introduction 
all that much, beyond altering dated references to politics and events current 
at the time of the original printing and to add a section on the discussion of 
the <i>Principles</i>, where we alert the reader to new developments, both in 
the economy and politics which we think need serious study.</p>

<p class="fst">In addition, the original introduction dealt with many of the 
ideas which reflected renewed interest in the concept of 'self-management'. The 
intervening years have not been kind to these notions. It is interesting to see 
how many of the ideas advanced by this movement and criticised theoretically at 
the time, have been incorporated into modern management theory and have 
re-emerged as new forms and methods of controlling and directing labour.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"An 'ideal' capitalism could tolerate the self-management of the 
conditions of production: as long as a normal profit is made by the firm, the 
organization of the work can be left to the workers." &#8211; Barrot &amp; Martin, Eclipse 
and Re-emergence of the Communist Movement, <i>Black &amp; Red</i>; Detroit: 1974; 
page 72</p>

<p class="fst">This text goes on to argue that this has become the programme of 
some of the more 'left wing' unions in France and Italy since the 'events' of 
1968 and 1969 in those countries.</p>

<p class="fst">Modern capitalism now demands the active intellectual engagement 
of the worker, if it is to make the best of 'just in time' and '100% quality 
control' methods of production and distribution. We feel this shows how 
parasitic modern capitalism has become, in so far as it has no new dynamic 
except to draw off the ingenuity and creativity of the working class itself. 
Whilst for the moment it may not be clear what the way forward is, we feel 
reassured that the contradictions of this mode of production will continue to 
generate their own opposition. It is in this process that we hope this pamphlet 
will prove useful.</p>

<h3><a name="h2">The Introduction Proper</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The pamphlet produced here in English was apparently first 
published in Dutch in <i>Radencommunismus</i> (No. 3, 1938), the journal of the 
Council Communist Group of Holland, and later translated into French and 
published in <i>Internationalisme</i> (No. 45, 1952). Revised and completed with 
a resume of the Principles (see second part) which were written for the 
International Communist journal 'Bilan' (Nos. 19-21, 1935) and then published by <i>
Informations Correspondences Ouvrières</i> (No. 42, 1965) from which it has been 
translated. It was first published in English by Coptic Press in 1968. "Appendix 
1" was produced as "Appendix B" in the Coptic Press edition, we have added 
"Appendix 2" ourselves, along with addresses where the original material may be 
obtained.</p>

<p class="fst">It falls into two parts:</p>

<p class="indentb">1. a critical analysis of council-communism in Germany 
between 1919-1929, when it disappeared temporarily from the historical scene;</p>

<p class="indentb">2. the <i>Principles</i> which were produced in 1930 in a 
study on <i><a href="../1930/index.htm">The Fundamental Principles of Communist Production and Distribution</a></i>, 
which was drawn up by the Dutch Council Communist group in collaboration with 
former Berlin members of the AAUD.</p>

<p class="fst">The first part is a useful introduction to British militant and 
revolutionary workers &#8211; and students &#8211; of a very important period of German 
working class history which has its parallel in this country. Very little 
information is readily available in English on the period 1918-1920 on the 
activities [and] ideas of the council-communist movement in Germany, and even 
less on its history prior to 1918, before it acquired it's known 
'theoreticians', most of whom are only known by being attacked by Lenin in his 
brochure <i>Left Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder</i>. (This pamphlet was 
published in Russian in April 1920, and translated into English, French, and 
German &#8211; and [was made] available in those languages from July 1920. So, it is 
almost certain that delegates to the Second Congress of the Third International 
in July of that year would not have had time to prepare any counter-arguments, 
or [to] debate those advanced by Lenin.)</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">Importance for Study</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The importance of studying the failure of the revolutionary 
movement to overthrow capitalism and it's State in Germany, is that it took 
place in an advanced capitalist country. The lessons of the defeat will have to 
be understood, otherwise, we are in danger of repeating the same mistakes or 
having the same inadequacies. These do not just apply to Germany after the First 
World War, but equally to Italy and especially to the area centred on Turin in 
1920 &#8211; crucially the failure of the workers to overthrow the capitalist state.</p>

<p class="fst">Existing studies of these events tend to fall into two 
categories. Firstly, there is the view that the revolution failed because of the 
absence of a party of the Bolshevik type. The second glorifies the council 
movement as being, alone, necessary (as this one does). The Bolshevik tendencies 
believe that it is their Party that takes power on behalf of the working class 
and then 'educates' them to bring about socialism. The council-communist 
position is to praise the decentralization of the workers' movement into 
autonomous organizations based on each city, town, factory, or section of 
industry, etc.. It was this decentralization, however, that allowed the survival 
of the State and the Army. These bodies along with the Social Democratic Party 
were able to restore 'law and order' with the help of <i>Freikorps</i> fascists 
and reactionary armed students. This glorification of decentralization actually 
weakens the working class by making it much more difficult to come to grips with 
the real requirements of workers in and after the seizure of power.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">The Trade Unions</a></h3>

<p class="fst">One of the major reasons for continuing to publish this pamphlet 
is that we believe that it still has real lessons for a workers' movement in 
this country and internationally. We believe that it is continually necessary 
for workers to broaden and generalise their experience, and that in Germany this 
experience even though it failed is particularly fruitful.</p>

<p class="fst">Firstly, on the question of the unions, the German workers found 
that in their efforts to form their own organs of struggle, they came up against 
the old Social Democratic trade unions. We know, too, how in Britain and in all 
capitalist countries, the union s have been more and more integrated into the 
state and no longer 'belong' to the workers. The time has come to state quite 
categorically that as time goes on, more and more and larger and larger sections 
of workers will be forced to break with and fight the unions in order to protect 
our interests as a class independent of capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">We say this not because we 'hate' the unions or we want to 
'disarm' the workers in their struggle with capital ( in fact quite the reverse) 
&#8211; it is simply the international experience of the working class that the unions 
are the arm of the capitalist class within our own ranks. This lesson must be 
absorbed into the day to day struggle to such an extent that it moulds the whole 
attitude and outlook of workers. Moreover even 'unofficial' organization so long 
as it remains tied to the outlook and mentality of trade unionism cannot escape 
this process.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">Reformism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">By this we mean Social Democracy and its representative in this 
country, the Labour Party. As the pamphlet says, it was once thought sufficient 
for a Labour Party to gain a parliamentary majority, and hey, <i>presto</i>, we 
would have socialism. Well, we have had seven Labour Governments and it is no 
nearer, despite 'critical support' for the Labour Party from the Left. Instead, 
we had nationalisation of major industries that were decrepit after the Second 
World War, and as soon as state subsidy and the 'sacrifices' that workers made 
to make them productive again had an effect, they are once again in private 
hands (but, with the State now playing the leading role in the economy despite 
Government propaganda about them being 'competitive').</p>

<p class="fst">It is absolutely vital for a new working class movement to take a 
clear and uncompromising attitude towards the State, Parliament and it's Labour 
Party hangers on. For too long we have had to suffer the illusions of the 
Parliamentary trick. The German workers paid the price of not smashing the newly 
established Weimar Republic at the earliest opportunity. This lesson alone makes 
the pamphlet worth republishing.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h6">The Role of the German Communist Party (KPD)</a></h3>

<p class="fst">As the pamphlet makes a clear, a significant minority of the 
German working class, could not accept the policies of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl 
Liebknecht as regards taking part in elections to the Constituent Assembly which 
set up the Weimar Republic. This policy was endorsed by the leadership of the 
Russian Communist Party and the Third International and followed the Bolshevik 
'tactic' of taking part in elections to the Russian <i>Duma</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">In addition, the KPD followed the Bolshevik policy of 'capturing' 
the trade unions and aimed to construct a 'mass party' like the SPD had been. 
With the benefit of hindsight we can see that the minority German workers were 
correct and the KPD was following an impossible policy. Therefore it was obvious 
that the KAPD had a better appreciation of the role and influence of Social 
Democracy within the workers movement.</p>

<p class="fst">It is a fact, however, that the accumulated weight of tradition, 
the forms of organization it imposes are a great load for the working class of a 
country like Germany (or Britain) with a long history of peaceful, Parliamentary 
struggle to overthrow. In revolutionary upheavals especially those brought on by 
defeat in war, it is necessary for workers to shed this load very quickly or 
they will be defeated even before they can get off the starting line. With the 
luxury of hindsight, we can say that the advanced sections of the working class 
should have broken with the German Social Democratic Party long before they 
eventually did. However prior to 1914 none of the foregoing was clear, only in 
Russia in 1905 had the workers formed a new kind of organization capable of 
responding to their needs as a class &#8211; the soviet or workers' council. In 
Russia, they quickly became a battleground for the various political tendencies 
within the workers' movement. So, in Germany the workers were breaking new 
ground &#8211; no wonder they made mistakes.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h7">Participation</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Workers' Councils as a form of organization now has quite a 
history, unfortunately from our point of view a form is all it is. It is not 
surprising that our rulers should seize on the creativity and enterprise of the 
working class to incorporate such movements into their scheme of things. The 
pamphlet in its latter part makes it clear that the form cannot be understood 
without its content. This is why so much effort was put into working out the <i>
Principles</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">(The Workers Councils were legalised and eventually emasculated 
in an Act of 4-February-1920. This accomplishment was an extension of the policy 
of Social Democracy since at least the turn of the century. The official report 
of the International Labour Organisation makes clear the basis upon which the 
emasculated councils were legalised:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"1. The Work[er]s Council was to be in no way [a] political 
body, its duties being purely economic.</p>

<p class="quoteb">2. In the economic sphere, it was not to serve as an 
instrument of class dictatorship, but merely as a new method put at the disposal 
of the workers to allow [sic] them to defend the rights which were granted to 
them by legislation and by the Constitution, and to supervise the practical 
working of labour conditions."<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Anyone who doubts not just the reactionary but avowedly 
counter-revolutionary nature of International Social Democracy and the Trade 
Unions, should read this report.)</p>

<p class="fst">In Britain, we have had a movement towards 'participation' ever 
since the First World War. Indeed it has been the special role of the Labour 
Party and the trade unions to enter into such collaborative agreements and to 
deliver workers bound hand and foot by them. Recently management's have 
recovered their nerve and felt able to browbeat workers into accepting such 
conditions as they offer by virtue of fear of the sack or redundancy, so that 
participation in the old sense has been pushed into the background. Nevertheless 
'progressive' management has long realised the value of encouraging workers' 
initiative and creativity, from allowing 'control' of the production process in 
many Japanese style production units down to the use of suggestion schemes. This 
has become a breeding ground for the 'less confrontational' type of shop steward 
identified in the Donovan report as 'more of a lubricant than an irritant'.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In our opinion much valuable work remains to be done in studying 
these new 'production' methods, which rely as much on psychological methods 
(loyalty to mates, concern to be identified with good quality output and 
encouraging other 'positive' attitudes) a s sheer control over and ownership of 
the productive process itself.</p>

<p class="fst">In the introduction to the previous edition of this pamphlet, the 
view was put forward that workers' councils might arise from the alleged 
'democratic' base of the trade union movement, and, in particular, the example 
of the printing industry was given with its distinctive 'chapel' form of 
organization. In the light of what we have written above, and more importantly, 
given the history of that particular industry and especially the national press, 
it should come as no surprise that we totally repudiate such a view. We have 
seen how the whole trade union structure has been integrated into the apparatus 
of the state. Of necessity, therefore, we expect workers' councils or whatever 
new form of organization is appropriate to come about in opposition to the 
exiting unions as workers seek to advance their separate interests as an 
independent class.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h8">Workers Councils</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The essential difference between 'participation' and the ideas 
advocated in this pamphlet is that there NO power sharing. Real workers' 
councils we know are established in the teeth of opposition from management, 
state, trade unions and even (or especially) shop stewards whose power they 
threaten. Councils are established not just in factories, but over whole working 
class districts. They deal not just with workers' organization of production, 
but with all aspects of social life &#8211; food, housing, transport, education and so 
on. They are made up of delegates elected by mass assemblies and all delegates 
are instantly revocable and answerable to those assemblies. These councils first 
came into existence in Russia in 1905 (the word <i>'soviet'</i> means council in 
Russian) and at all times of revolutionary upheaval ever since. In Germany, 
Italy, Hungary, Poland, wherever workers form a distinctive section of the 
population this form of organization has emerged time and again. The 
establishment of working class organs of power on a wide scale challenges all 
capitalist institutions, especially the state and it representatives the army 
and police. The fight of the workers to maintain their hold over production and 
distribution, and to smash the power of the state is decisive &#8211; this is the 
dictatorship of the proletariat. It is precisely at this moment that the 
struggle breaks out in the councils for clarity and understanding of the 
situation. It should be clear that no political parties as such have any role at 
all with in the councils.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> However, it is inevitable that workers will be 
influenced by the conceptions and thinking of such groupings.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h9">Political Parties</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Suffice it to say that we think workers should be aware of two 
main tendencies. Firstly, all the different varieties of Leninists who will seek 
to gain entry to the councils and try to tie them to their Party &#8211; as was the 
experience in Russia. This is not the place to outline our estimation of those 
events. But, it should be obvious that a bureaucracy that transmits orders to a 
passive and demoralised working class, one-man management, the militarisation of 
labour and forced labour to build a 'workers' state', is not our idea of 
proletarian dictatorship. The <i>soviets</i> were emptied of their revolutionary 
content and workers became dispirited that all their sacrifice should have been 
in vain.</p>

<p class="fst">The break-up of the Soviet Union and its satellites since 1989, 
not only saw the demise of the orthodox Stalinist parties, but has seen a 
similar crisis break out within the various Trotskyist movements and other 
Leftist groupings influenced by them. Trotskyism's only distinctive feature has 
been a 'critical' analysis of the Soviet Union but there has recently appeared 
an unhealthy interest in the politics and movements attacked in Lenin's "Left 
Wing Communism...".</p>

<p class="fst">Unless individuals influenced by the counter revolutionary 
politics of these groupings repudiate the influence of Trotskyism, we believe 
their only purpose is to dress up and disguise their failed politics by 
appropriating some of the ideas of the 'ultra-left'.</p>

<p class="fst">Trotskyist politics is based upon an acceptance of Theses, 
Organisation and Politics of the first four Congresses of the Third 
International. As this pamphlet makes clear the politics of the ultra-left 
cannot be welded onto a politics and organization from which they were 
systematically hounded by those whom the Trotskyists quite openly claim as their 
founders. It may be possible for individuals to emerge from Trotskyist and other 
like organizations, but we do not believe it is possible for such organizations 
themselves to accept and integrate the critique of the ultra-left into their 
politics, because they are out and out capitalist organizations. As such their 
interest in ultra-left or Left Communist ideas is nothing other than an attempt 
to radicalise the counter revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">Being against the role of these Parties within the councils does 
not mean that we do not fight for a revolutionary perspective within these 
bodies as though politics could be abolished just like that. There is a role for 
organised political minorities. It is precisely the role of revolutionary 
tendencies and organizations (whatever they call themselves) to struggle for a 
revolutionary consciousness of the working class at all times, and to ensure 
that the revolution is successful. Having done this, there is no longer the need 
for these separate organizations to exist.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h10">Self-Management or Autonomy</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Secondly, there is what we might term the anarchist conception 
that sees the councils as autonomous, self-managing production units. This may 
be all very well for a utopia, but in fact this conception does not get rid of 
capitalism. It ignores the State. It ignores the inter relationships of the 
capitalist world market. This conception actually reinforces the existing 
irrational capitalist production relationships by institutionalising them. It is 
impossible abolish wages and prices on the basis of some 'self-managed' 
factories. Indeed we have seen how the capitalist class is very happy to sit 
back and allow workers take over plants and 'run' them themselves. They know 
full well that before long such 'experiments' soon collapse, or, if they do 
succeed, it is only by reproducing the same hierarchy as before (and can be used 
by bosses to show how 'uneconomic' a plant is unless there are 'savings' &#8211; which 
always pits worker against worker). Either way the workers are defeated and 
worse still the idea of workers ' councils is discredited.</p>

<p class="fst">In addition, the idea of autonomous production units supposes 
that the workers have a ready made productive process that is the basis for 
socialism or communism, the two are the same thing. But whole sectors of the 
modern capitalist economy will have to b e destroyed (for instance, insurance, 
advertising, arms industry, etc.). Do we really want self-management of poison 
gas manufacture? Other sectors will need to be expanded or even created to 
satisfy the newly discovered needs of society. Factories will in many cases have 
to switch production. Almost certainly whole industries will simply close down.</p>

<p class="fst">Who decides all this? The workers formerly employed in a 
particular plant or the representative bodies of society? If it is the workers 
in each particular plant then it is sure recipe for confusion and chaos. As 
workers in all parts of production are al so consumers, then why should a worker 
in one plant not have equal right to decide what is produced at another and vice 
versa. This must also hold true for all those outside the sphere of production. 
Only then will there be the basis for socialism &#8211; which is the abolition of 
wage-labour and class society. If this is not done, the self-managed production 
units are in danger of becoming small-scale capitalist economies, realising 
value by selling products and crediting others for supplying raw materials, in 
short, the self-management of exploitation. Capitalist social relations will 
'spontaneously' spring up, unless the economy the workers introduce is superior 
to it.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h11">The Principles of Communist Production and Distribution</a></h3>

<p class="fst">We can see now how these two considerations are very much 
interlinked. The second part of the pamphlet details an attempt to work out the 
principles upon which a communist society might be built. We are not sure if 
this is done successfully, but what we are sure of is that such work is not pure 
speculation. The Left is quite happy to say that they are not in the business of 
future gazing, but that is because so many of them live in the past. It is our 
view, that you cannot expect workers to renounce the world they know intimately, 
without at least them acquiring the tools with which to construct a new one. In 
this case, even the 'mistakes' made by a previous generation are useful.</p>

<p class="fst">Capitalism has developed the means of production to such an 
extent that we now have the means to build such a society.</p>

<p class="fst">Unfortunately, the <i>Principles of Communist Production and 
Distribution</i> are not reproduced here in full, but some things can be said &#8211; 
with the absence of wages, prices and other capitalist forms, there is no 
'economics' of socialism in the sense of objective laws that operate 'behind the 
backs' of the producers. All attempts to find and codify such 'laws' such as we 
have seen worked out by various Stalinist parties, obsessed as they are by the 
need to 'build socialism' by accumulating surpluses which will be invested 
according to a Plan, are reactionary.</p>

<p class="fst">Instead, the only 'laws' which we recognise are those imposed on 
us by necessity, the time for workers to make sacrifices for some long distant 
future is over. The future is here and now, and we mean to have it. Production 
must be controlled by those institutions which the working class itself creates. 
The problem of matching supply and demand is not a technical one for 
specialists, but initially at least, must be debated out in the open through 
these institutions, which will themselves take stock of their available 
resources and match them to the requirements, which they themselves will work 
out. With the worker freed from dependence on wages, and society finally able to 
consciously plan how to meet its requirements &#8211; the last fetter to truly human 
freedom, class society, will disappear.</p>

<p class="fst">It is obvious then that the publication of this pamphlet is no 
academic exercise. We have sought in this introduction to show how the practical 
experience of the German working class in these years is of direct benefit and 
relevance to workers today, not just in Britain but all over the world. The 
history of the world since that time also shows the terrible price humanity has 
to pay for the consequences of the working class's failure to overturn the 
weight of accumulated tradition and rise up to its historic mission. All over 
the world the position of the worker is the same, there is no longer any need 
for workers to ride on the back of other social classes and movements as there 
was in Marx and Engels day. Neither is it now necessary to wait until the 
practical movement caught up with their theoretical elaboration. It is on the 
basis of the German and other working class practical experiences that we set 
out to make clear the process of history, whereby political and economic power 
can be transferred fro m the capitalist class to the working class. It is on 
these same experiences that we advance a programme and a set of ideas that will 
make revolution a practical task for the workers of the world.</p>

<h1>The Origins of the Movement for Workers' Councils in Germany</h1>
<h2><a name="h12">1. The Revolution Breaks Out</a></h2>

<p class="fst">In November 1918, the German front collapsed. The whole war 
machine broke up. At Kiel, the officers of the fleet decided upon a last stand 
'to save their honour.' They found, however, that the sailors refused to obey. 
This was not, in fact, their first mutiny; previous attempts to protest against 
the war had been put down with bullets and promises. But this time, they scored 
an immediate success. The Red Flag went up, first on one warship, then on 
another.</p>

<p class="fst">The sailors elected delegates who, ship by ship formed a Council. 
From now on the sailors determined to make the movement spread. They had 
declined to die fighting the enemy; neither did they wish to die fighting the so 
called loyal troops who would be called in on the side of repression. They 
formed the backbone of the movement for Soldiers, Sailors and Workers Councils. 
And meanwhile they were going ashore and marching on the great port of Hamburg; 
from there, the message poured out all over Germany. Delegates left by train, 
and otherwise, for all parts of the country.</p>

<p class="fst">The first blow of freedom had been struck! Events now moved 
rapidly. Hamburg welcomed the sailors with enthusiasm. Soldiers and workers 
joined in the movement; they too elected councils. While this kind of 
organization was unknown in practice, within four days a vast network of workers 
and soldiers councils covered Germany. Perhaps some talk had been heard of 
Russian soviets (1917-18) but in view of the censorship, very little. At all 
events, no party or organization had proposed this form of struggle. It was an 
entirely spontaneous movement.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h13">Forerunners of the Councils</a></h3>

<p class="fst">It is true that during the war similar organizations had in fact 
made their appearance in the factories. They were formed in the course of 
strikes, by elected representatives, the equivalent of our shop stewards. Given 
minor offices in the union machinery, in the tradition of German trade unionism, 
they were the link between the local and central headquarters, to transmit the 
demands of the workers to HQ. These demands, and the number of grievances, were 
naturally very high during the War. In the main they concerned intensified work 
and price increases. But the German unions (like those of other countries) had 
formed a united front with the Government (the <i>Burgfrieden</i>). They 
guaranteed social peace in exchange for slight advantages for the workers and in 
particular participation of the union leaders on various official organizations. 
Thus the stewards in presenting grievances found themselves hammering at a brick 
wall. The 'hotheads' and 'trouble makers' were, sooner or later, shanghaied into 
the Forces, in special units. It became difficult to take up the struggle within 
the unions.</p>

<p class="fst">As a result, the stewards gradually lost contact with union 
headquarters. Union affairs ceased to interest them, but the workers demands 
remained what they were. Then, in 1917, a flood of unofficial strikes suddenly 
swept out over the country. No stable organization led it. It was entirely 
spontaneous. It proceeded naturally from the work done by the stewards and the 
unsatisfied demands of the workers.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h14">The New Movement</a></h3>

<p class="fst">This new labour movement had come into existence without the aid 
of any party, and without any leadership. Any ideological considerations of any 
nature had to give way before the demands of the moment. In 1918, this sporadic 
movement, consisting of trends cut off from one another, became united by reason 
of its identical form of struggle. They came to form a new means of 
administration.</p>

<p class="fst">On the one hand were the 'normal' forms &#8211; police, food control, 
organization of labour; on the other hand, in all important industrial centers 
were the workers councils. In Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, the Ruhr, Central 
Germany, Saxony; the workers' councils had to be recognised and reckoned with. 
But they had up to that time few concrete results. Why?</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h15">An Easy Victory!</a></h3>

<p class="fst">This arose from the very ease with which the workers' councils 
were formed. The state apparatus was breaking down, but not as a result of a 
persistent struggle by the workers. It was breaking down in the stress of war, 
and the workers councils met in a vacuum. Their movement was growing without 
resistance, without the need to fight. All that the population of Germany was 
speaking of was &#8211; Peace and an end to the War. This was of course an essential 
difference with the Russian position in 1917. In Russia the first revolutionary 
wave (the February revolution) overthrew the Tsarist regime; but the War went 
on. The workers movement had to become bolder and more decided; it had to 
tighten the pressure on the State. But in Germany, the first aspiration of the 
population, Peace, gave way to the Republic. But what did the Republic mean?</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h16">The Weimar Republic</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Before the War, working class practice and most working class 
theory was that approved of and carried out by the Social Democratic Party and 
the Trade Unions, adopted and agreed to by the majority of organised workers. To 
this Socialist Democracy, the bourgeois democratic State was to be the lever for 
Socialism. They felt it would suffice to have a majority in Parliament, and with 
Socialist ministers it would be Socialism.</p>

<p class="fst">There was also, it is true, a revolutionary current, of which 
Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg were the best known representatives. 
Nevertheless, this current never developed a conception clearly opposed to State 
Socialism. It formed only an opposition within the Social Democratic Party, and 
was not distinguishable from it by the majority of workers.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h17">New Conceptions</a></h3>

<p class="fst">But, new conceptions came about with the great mass movements of 
1918-21. They were not the creation of the so-called 'vanguard', but were 
created by the masses themselves. The independent activity of the workers and 
soldiers adopted the organizational form of councils as a matter of expediency; 
these were the new forms of class organization. But, because there is a direct 
connection between the forms taken by the class struggle and the conceptions of 
the future society, it goes without saying that, here and there, the old ideas 
of nationalisation, etc., began to totter.</p>

<p class="fst">The workers were now leading their own struggles, outside the 
apparatus of the Party and Trade Union; and the workers began to think that they 
could exert a direct influence on social life, by means of their own councils. 
There would be a 'Dictatorship of the Proletariat', they said but it would be a 
dictatorship not exercised by a Party, but would be an expression of the unity, 
complete and lasting, of the whole working population. Of course, such a society 
would not be democratic in the bourgeois sense of the term, since that part of 
the population not participating in the new organization of social life would 
have no voice, either in discussion, or in decision.</p>

<p class="fst">We were saying that the old conceptions began to totter. But, it 
quickly became evident that the Parliamentary and Trade Union traditions were 
too rooted in the masses to be quickly wiped out. The bourgeoisie, the Social 
Democratic Party, and the Trade Unions called upon these traditions, in order to 
break down the new conceptions. In particular, the Social Democratic Party 
congratulated itself in speeches about this new means the masses had of 
asserting their part in social life. The Party even went as far as demanding 
that this new form of direct power be approved and codified in law.</p>

<p class="fst">But, despite this ostensible sympathy, the old working class 
movement in the main reproached the councils for not respecting 'democracy', 
although excusing them because of their 'lack of experience'. The 'lack of 
democracy' consisted of not yielding a large enough place to the politicians, 
and in competing with them. In demanding what they called 'working class 
democracy', the old party and unions demanded that all currents of the working 
class movement be represented in the councils, in proportion to their respective 
importance.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h18">The Trap</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Few workers were capable of refuting this argument which 
corresponded with their own ingrained beliefs. Despite what they had achieved, 
they still believed in traditional forms of organization. Thus they allowed the 
representatives of the Social Democratic movement, the Unions, the Left Social 
Democrats, the consumers Co-operatives etc., all to be represented on the 
councils as well as the factory delegates. The councils on such a basis could no 
longer be directly representative of the workers on the shop floor. They became 
mere units of the old workers movement, and thus came to work for the 
restoration of capitalism by means of the building of 'democratic State 
capitalism' through the Social Democratic Party.</p>

<p class="fst">It was the ruin of the workers' efforts. The council delegates no 
longer received their mandates from the shop floor, but from the different 
organizations. The workers were called on to respect and assure the rule of 
'Order', proclaiming that 'in disorder there is no Socialism'. Under those 
conditions, the councils rapidly lost all value in the eyes of the workers. The 
bourgeois institutions regained their functions without caring about the 
opinions of the councils; this was precisely the goal of the old workers 
movement.</p>

<p class="fst">The old workers' movement could be proud of its victory. The law 
passed by the <i>Reichstag</i> fixed in detail the rights and duties of the 
councils. Their future task was to see that social legislation was respected. In 
other words, they were to become cogs in the State machine. Instead of 
demolishing the State, they were to help in making it run smoothly. Old 
established traditions had proved stronger than spontaneity.</p>

<p class="fst">But, despite this 'abortion of the revolution', it cannot be said 
that the victory of the conservative elements had been simple or easy. The new 
climate of feeling was still strong enough for hundreds of thousands of workers 
to struggle obstinately in order that their councils should keep the character 
of new class units. There was to be five years of ceaseless conflict (sometimes 
armed fights) and the massacre of 35,000 revolutionary workers, before the 
movement of the councils was finally beaten by the united front of the 
bourgeoisie, the old workers movement, and the 'White Guards' formed by the 
Prussian land owners and the reactionary students.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h19">Political Currents</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Four political currents can be roughly distinguished among the 
workers:</p>

<p class="indentb">1. The Social Democrats &#8211; They wanted the gradual 
nationalisation of the large industries by parliamentary methods. They also 
wanted to reserve for the unions the right to mediate between the workers and 
state ownership.</p>

<p class="indentb">2. The Communists &#8211; Inspired more or less by the Russian 
example, they advocated direct expropriation of the capitalists by the masses. 
They maintained the revolutionary workers should 'capture' the Trade Unions and 
'make them revolutionary'.</p>

<p class="indentb">3. Anarcho-Syndicalists &#8211; They opposed the taking of power, 
and of any kind of State, according to them, Trade Unions were an integral part 
of the form of the future; it was necessary to struggle for a growth of the 
unions in such a way that they would be able to take over the whole of social 
life.</p>

<p class="indentb">One of their best known theoreticians wrote in 1920 that t he 
unions should not be considered as a transitory product of capitalism, but 
rather as seeds of the future socialist organization of society. It seemed at 
first, in 1919, that the hour of this movement had come. These unions grew after 
the crumbling of the <i>Kaiserreich</i> In 1920, the Anarchist unions had about 
200,000 members.</p>

<p class="indentb">4. The Factory Organisations &#8211; However, this same year, 1920, 
the effective forces of the revolutionary unions were reduced. A large part of 
their membership now made its way towards quite a different form of 
organization, better adapted to the prevailing conditions, namely the 
revolutionary factory organization. In this, each factory had or should have 
had, its own organization acting independently of the others, and which did not 
depend upon the others. Each factory was to be an 'independent republic'.</p>

<p class="fst">These factory organizations were a creation of the German masses, 
spontaneously; but it should be pointed out that they appeared in the framework 
of a revolution which, though not yet defeated was stagnant. It was quickly 
evident that the workers could not, in the immediate period, conquer and 
organise economic and political power through the medium of the councils. It was 
necessary first of all to carry on a merciless struggle against the forces which 
opposed the councils. The revolutionary workers began therefore to muster their 
own forces in all the factories, in order to keep a direct grasp on social life. 
Through their propaganda they strove to re-awaken the workers consciousness, 
calling upon them to leave the unions AND join the revolutionary factory 
organization. The workers as a whole would then be able to lead their own 
struggles themselves and conquer economic and social power over all society.</p>

<p class="fst">On the face of things, the working class thus took a great step 
backwards on the organization plane. While previously the power of the workers 
was concentrated in some powerful centralised organizations, it was now 
separated into some hundreds of little groups, uniting some hundreds of 
thousands of workers, depending on the importance of the factory. In reality, 
this showed itself to be the only form of organization that allowed the outline 
of workers power; and therefore, despite its relative smallness, it alarmed the 
bourgeoisie and the Social Democrats.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h20">The Development of the Factory Organizations</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The isolation into small groups factory by factory was not 
premeditated, nor a matter of principle. It was due to the fact that these 
organizations appeared, separately and spontaneously, in the course of 
unofficial strikes (for example, among the Ruhr miners in 1919). Many tried to 
unite these organizations and present a united front of factory organizations; 
the initiative for this coming from Hamburg and Bremen. In April 1920, there was 
the first conference for unification of the factory councils. Delegates came 
from every industrial region of Germany. The police broke up the Congress; but 
too late. The general unified organization had already been founded; and it had 
formulated its principles of action. This was given the name of the General 
Workers Union of Germany (<i>Allgemeine Arbeiter Union Deutschlands</i> &#8211; AAUD).</p>

<p class="fst">The AAUD was based on the struggle against the trade unions and 
the legalised workers' councils, and rejected parliamentarism. Each organization 
affiliated to the Union had a right to a maximum independence and freedom of 
choice as to tactics.</p>

<p class="fst">Almost immediately the AAUD began to grow. At that time the trade 
unions had more members than they ever had, or were ever likely to see in the 
foreseeable future. The socialist unions in 1920 grouped almost eight million 
paid-up members in 52 unions; the Christian unions had more than a million 
members; the company (or 'yellow') unions, had about 300,000. Then, there were 
the anarcho-syndicalists unions (<i>Freie Arbeiter Union Deutschlands</i> &#8211; 
FAUD) and also some breakaway unions which, a little while later, affiliated to 
the Moscow-controlled Red International of Trade Unions &#8211; RILU.</p>

<p class="fst">At first, the AAUD numbered 80 000 (April 1920); by the end of 
1920, this was 300,000. It is true that many of its constituent members were at 
the same time adherents either of the FAUD or RILU.</p>

<p class="fst">There were, however, political differences in the AAUD and in 
December, a number of associations left it to form a new association, the AAUD-E 
(<i>Einheitsorganization</i> &#8211; or united organization). Even after this break, 
the AAUD reckoned on more than 200,000 members (4th Congress, June 1921); but 
this was by then a paper organization. The defeat of the Central German rising 
in 1921, led to the dismantling and destruction of the AAUD. It could no longer 
resist police persecution.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h21">The German Communist Party (KPD)</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Before examining the splits in the factory organization movement, 
it is necessary to refer to the role of the KPD. During the War (1914-18) the 
Social Democratic Party had placed itself alongside the ruling classes, to 
ensure 'social peace', with the exception of a militant fringe including some 
party officials of whom the best known were Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht. 
These agitated against the War and violently criticised the Party. They were not 
alone. In addition to their group, the 'Spartacus League' (<i>Spartakusbund</i>), 
there were groups like the 'Internationalists' of Dresden and Frankfurt; the 
Left Radicals (<i>die Linksradikalen</i>) of Hamburg and the 'Workers Party of 
Bremen. After November 1918 and the fall of the Empire, these groups which came 
from the Social Democratic 'Left' were for a 'struggle in the streets' that 
would forge a new political organization and to some extent would follow the 
lines of the Russian Revolution. They held a congress of unification in Berlin 
(30 December 1918) and formed the Communist Party of Germany. (A translation of 
the proceedings of this Congress &#8211; into French &#8211; with other interesting 
information, will be found in 'Spartacus et la Commune de Berlin' Prudhommeaux, 
Cahiers Spartacus, Oct-Nov 1949).</p>

<p class="fst">Within the Party there were many revolutionary workers who 
demanded "All Power to the Workers Councils!". But, there were many, who, from 
the first, regarded themselves as the cadres of the Left; they felt they were 
the leaders by right of seniority, notions which they had brought with them from 
the old Party. The workers who came into the KPD in growing numbers, did not 
always stand up to their leaders; partly from respect for 'discipline', partly 
by their own yielding to outdated conceptions of leadership. The idea of 
'factory organizations' was a vastly different conception. But, of course, it 
was open to misrepresentation. It could mean, and the leadership of the KPD most 
certainly took it to mean, a mere form of organization, nothing more, subject to 
directives imposed on it from outside. It could also mean, and this was what the 
militants had been taking it to mean, a vastly different matter &#8211; a means of 
control from the bottom up. In its new sense, the notion of factory 
organizations implied an overthrow of ideas previously held with regard to:</p>

<p class="indentb">(a) the unity of the working class;</p>

<p class="indentb">(b) the tactics of the struggle;</p>

<p class="indentb">(c) the relationship between masses and their leadership;</p>

<p class="indentb">(d) the dictatorship of the proletariat;</p>

<p class="indentb">(e) the relationship between state and society;</p>

<p class="indentb">(f) communism as an economic and political system.</p>

<p class="fst">These new problems had to be faced; they had to be answered, or 
the whole new idea of revolution would disappear. But, the Party cadres were 
unwilling to face these ideas. All they thought of doing was to rebuild the new 
(Communist) Party on the model of the old (Social Democratic) Party. They tried 
to avoid what was bad in the old Party and to paint it in red instead of pink 
and white. There was no place for the new ideas. And then, these new ideas were 
not presented in a coherent whole, coming from a single brain, or as if fallen 
from Heaven. They were the new ideas of the generation, and many of the young 
militants of the KPD supported them; but side by side with support for the new 
ideas was respect for the old ideological foundation.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h22">Parliamentarism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The KPD was divided on all the problems raised by the new notion 
of 'factory organization' from its very inception. When the Social Democratic 
President, Ebert, announced elections for a Constituent Assembly, the Party had 
to decide whether to take part in the elections or to denounce them. It was 
debated hotly at the Congress. The majority of the workers wanted to refuse to 
take part in the elections at all. But the Party leadership, including 
Liebknecht and Luxemburg, declared for an electoral campaign. The leadership was 
beaten on votes, and the majority of the Party declared itself 
'Anti-Parliamentarian'. It stated, that in its view, the Constituent Assembly 
was only there to consolidate the power of the bourgeoisie, by giving it a 
'legalistic' foundation. On the contrary, not only were the proletarian elements 
of the KPD opposed to participating in such an Assembly; they wished to 
'activate' the workers' councils already existing and to create others, through 
which they would give meaning to the difference between parliamentary democracy 
and working class democracy, as advocated in the slogan "All Power to the 
Workers Councils" (<i>Alle Macht an die Arbeiter Räten!</i>).</p>

<p class="fst">The leadership of the KPD saw in this anti-parliamentarism, not a 
revival of revolutionary thought, but a 'regression' to Trade Unionist and even 
Anarchist ideas, which in their mind belonged to the beginnings of industrial 
capitalism. But in truth the anti-parliamentarism of the new current had not 
much in common with 'revolutionary syndicalism' and 'anarchism'. It even 
represented its negation. While the anti-parliamentarism of the libertarians 
centred on the rejection of political power, and in particular, rejected the 
dictatorship of the proletariat, the new current considered anti-parliamentarism 
a necessary condition for the taking of political power. It was 'Marxist 
Anti-Parliamentarism'.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h23">The Trade Unions</a></h3>

<p class="fst">On the question of trade union activities, the leadership of the 
KPD differed from that of the factory organizations. This was only to be 
expected. It aroused fierce discussion after the Congress (by which time both 
Liebknecht and Luxemburg had disappeared from the scene having been murdered by 
the Reaction). Those who supported the councils said, "Leave the Trade Unions! 
Join the factory organizations!". But the Communist leaders said, "Stay in the 
Unions!" The KPD did not think it could capture the Union HQ, but it did think 
it could capture the leadership of the local branches. It might then, reasoned 
the KPD, be possible to unite these locals in a new 'revolutionary' trade union 
movement.</p>

<p class="fst">But once again the leadership of the KPD was defeated. Most of 
its sections refused to carry out these instructions. The leadership was firm, 
however, even at the expense of expelling the majority of its members. It was of 
course supported by the Russian Party, and its chief Lenin, who at this time 
published his disastrous pamphlet on Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder.</p>

<p class="fst">At the Heidelberg Conference in October 1919, the leadership 
succeeded in 'democratically' expelling more than half the Party.... Henceforth, 
the KPD was able go ahead with its conduct of parliamentary and trade union 
policies &#8211; with pitiful results. The expelled members united with a party of 
left socialists and quadrupled their members, but for three years only. They 
formed a new party the Communist Workers Party of Germany, (KAPD &#8211; <i>
Kommunistische Arbeiter Partei Deutschlands</i>). The KPD had lost its most 
militant elements and had henceforth no alternative but to surrender itself 
unconditionally to the Moscow line in the newly set up Third International. 
(The Comintern's agent in Germany at this time was Radek.)</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h24">The Communist Workers Party (KAPD)</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The KAPD entered immediately into a direct relationship with the 
AAUD. At this time, the KAPD was a force that counted. Its criticisms of trade 
union and parliamentary action and its practice of direct and violent action, 
and its struggle against capitalist exploitation, made it a positive influence, 
first of all on the factory floor; also through its press and publications that 
were the best that Marxist literature had to offer in this time of decadence of 
the Marxist movement. Even so, the KAPD retained some encumbrances in the form 
of the old Marxist traditions.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="h25">2. The KAPD and the AAUD: Differences</a></h2>

<p class="fst">Let us leave the parties for a moment and go back to the factory 
organizations. This young movement had shown that important changes had been 
made in the working class world. There was general agreement on the following 
points:</p>

<p class="indentb">- the new organization had to be built up and continue to 
grow;</p>

<p class="indentb">- its structure must be such that no clique of leaders could 
establish itself;</p>

<p class="indentb">- once it had established itself with millions of members it 
would establish the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">There were two major points of controversy within the AAUD. The 
first was: should there be a political party of the workers outside the AAUD and 
the second was on the question of administration of social and economic life.</p>

<p class="fst">At first the AAUD had only rather vague relations with the KPD. 
Its differences were of no importance. But it was different once the KAPD was 
formed. The KAPD immediately became involved in the affairs of the AAUD. Many of 
its members did not agree with this. In Saxony, Frankfurt and Hamburg etc., 
there was strong opposition to working with the KAPD. Germany was still 
extremely decentralised, and its decentralization was reflected in the workers 
organizations; hence the possibility of the KAPD working with the AAUD in some 
districts and not in others. As a consequence, the militants who opposed the 
formation within the AAUD of a 'leadership clique' (namely the KAPD), left, and 
formed their own organization the AAUD-E, which rejected the idea of a party of 
the proletariat and held that the factory organization was all sufficient.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h26">The Common Platform</a></h3>

<p class="fst">These three currents agreed in their analysis of the modern 
world. They accepted that because of the change in society, the proletariat no 
longer formed a restricted minority in society that could not struggle alone and 
had to seek alliances with other classes, as had been the case in the days of 
Marx. At least in the developed countries of the West, that period was over. In 
those countries the proletariat was now the majority of the population while all 
the layers of the bourgeoisie were united behind big capital. Henceforth 
revolution was the affair of the proletariat ALONE. Capitalism had entered its 
death crisis. (This was the current analysis accepted in the '20s and '30s.) But 
if society had changed in the West at least, then so had the conception of 
communism to change. The old ideas, in the old organizations, represented quite 
the opposite of social emancipation. Otto Rühle, one of the chief theoreticians 
of the AAUD-E, said this (in 1924):</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The nationalisation of the means of production, which continues 
to be the programme of social-democracy at the same time as it is that of the 
communists, is not socialisation. Through nationalisation of the means of 
production, it is possible to attain a strongly centralised State capitalism, 
which will have perhaps some superiority to private capitalism, but which will 
nonetheless be capitalism." [Otto Rühle]</p>

<p class="fst">Communism could only arrive from the action of the workers 
themselves, struggling actively on their own. For that, new forms of 
organization were necessary. But what would such organizations be? Here, 
opinions divided, and conflicting views could cause endless splits. Although by 
this time, the workers had turned away from revolutionary action, and any 
decisions the movement might take were of little consequence, it may be of 
interest to note what their interpretations of the future society were.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h27">The Double Organisation</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The KAPD rejected the idea of the Leninist party, such as 
prevailed after the Russian Revolution (a mass party) and held that a 
revolutionary party was essentially the party of an elite, based on quality not 
quantity. Such a party, uniting the most advanced elements of the proletariat, 
must act as a 'leaven within the masses', that is it must spread propaganda, 
keep up political discussion etc. Its strategy must be 'class versus class,' 
based on the struggle in the factories and armed uprising; sometimes, even, as a 
preliminary, terrorist action (such as bombings, bank robberies, raids on 
jewellers shops etc.) which were frequent in the early '20s. The struggle in the 
factories, led by action committees, would have the task of creating the 
atmosphere and the class consciousness necessary to mass struggles and to 
bringing ever greater masses of workers to mobilise themselves for decisive 
struggles.</p>

<p class="fst">Herman Gorter, one of the principal theoreticians of this party, 
justified, thus, the necessity of a small communist party:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Most proletarians are <i>ignoramuses</i>. They have little 
notion of economics and politics, do not know much of national and international 
events, of the relations which exist between these latter and of the influence 
which they exert on the revolution. By reason of their position in society they 
cannot get to know all this. This is why they can never act at the right moment. 
They act when they should not, do not act when they should. They repeatedly make 
mistakes."<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">So, according to this theory, the small select Party would have 
an educational mission, it would be a catalyst of ideas. But the task of 
regrouping the masses and organising them, in a network of factory 
organizations, would be that of the AAUD. Its essential objective would be to 
counter and overthrow the influence of the Trade Unions, through propaganda, but 
more particularly through determined action, that of a "group which shows in the 
struggle what the masses must become" [Gorter]. Finally, in the course of 
revolutionary struggle, these factory organizations would become workers' 
councils, uniting all the workers and controlled by them. The 'dictatorship of 
the proletariat' would be nothing more than an AAUD extended to the whole of 
German industry.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h28">The AAUD-E Argument</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The AAUD-E was, as has been said, opposed to a political party 
separate from the factory organizations. It wanted a united organization which 
would lead the day to day struggle, and later on take over the administration of 
society, on the system of workers' councils. It would have both economic and 
political aims. It differed from revolutionary syndicalism in that it disagreed 
with the hostility to working class political power and the dictatorship of the 
proletariat. On the other hand, it did not see the usefulness of a political 
party (KAPD style). Though granting the same arguments about the backwardness of 
the working class, for them the factory organization itself would suffice for 
the educational role so long as freedom of speech and discussion were assured 
within them.</p>

<p class="fst">The AAUD-E criticised the KAPD for being a centralised party, 
with professional leaders and paid editors, only distinguished form the KPD by 
its rejection of Parliamentarism. They derided the 'double organization' as a 
'double pie card' for the benefit of the leaders. The AAUD-E rejected the notion 
of paid leaders; 'neither cards nor rules nor anything of that kind', they said. 
Some of them went so far as to found anti-organization organizations.</p>

<p class="fst">Roughly, the AAUD-E held that if the proletariat is too weak or 
divided to take decisions, no party decision could remedy this. Nobody could 
take the place of the proletariat. It must, by itself, overcome its own defects, 
otherwise it will be beaten and will pay a heavy price for its defeat. For them 
the double organization was a hangover from the political party and trade union 
partnership.</p>

<p class="fst">As a result of the differences between these three trends, KAPD, 
AAUD and AAUD-E, the latter refused to participate with the other two in the 
Central German insurrection of 1921. This was launched and led in a great part 
by the armed elements of the KAPD (still at that time regarded as sympathetic to 
the Third International), since the AAUD-E claimed it was merely to camouflage 
the events in Russia and in particular the repression of the Kronstadt sailors 
and workers by the Red Army under Trotsky.</p>

<p class="fst">Despite continued internal dissension, always very high and often 
obscured by personalities; in spite of excesses provoked by disappointment, the 
'communist spirit', that is to say, the insistence on violent direct action, the 
passionate denunciation of all political and trade union colours (including the 
'palace mayors' of Moscow) continued to permeate the masses. All financed by 
illegal means; their members, though often thrown out of employment because of 
their subversive activities, were extremely active in the street and at public 
meetings etc.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h29">Disappointment</a></h3>

<p class="fst">But it had been believed that the growth of the factory 
organizations of 1919-20 would continue at the same rate, that they would become 
a mass movement of 'millions of conscious communists' which would override the 
power of the allegedly working class trade unions. This was not however to prove 
the case. They started from the hypothesis that the proletariat would struggle 
and win as an organised class, and would work out the way of building the new 
organization. In the growth of the AAUD or the AAUD-E, the development of the 
fighting spirit and class consciousness of the workers could be measured. But 
these organizations drew in on themselves after the American financed economic 
expansion of 1923-29. In the years of Depression they were reduced to a mere few 
hundred members, a few cells here and there in the factories which employed some 
20 million. By the time the Hitlerites came on the scene, the factory 
organizations had shrunk from being 'general' organizations of the workers to 
being cells of conscious council communists. Notwithstanding what their aims 
might be or their press might say, the AAUD and the AAUD-E had become no more 
than minor political parties.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h30">The Function of the Organisations</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Was it however, merely the withering away of their membership 
that transformed the factory organizations into minor political parties?</p>

<p class="fst">No!</p>

<p class="fst">It was a change of function. Though the factory organizations 
never had for their proclaimed task the leading of strikes, negotiations with 
employers, formulation of demands (all of which they left to the strikers 
themselves) &#8211; they were the organs of struggle. They restricted their functions 
to those of propaganda and support. Every time a strike was launched the factory 
organizations helped to run it; their press was the strike press; they put on 
speakers, AAUD or AAUD-E and ran meetings. But, so far as conducting 
negotiations was concerned, it was the task of the strike committee and the 
members of the factory organizations did not represent their group as such but 
the strikers who had elected them and to whom they were responsible.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD, as a political party, had a different function. Its 
task was seen as being above all propaganda, economic and political analysis. At 
election times it undertook anti-parliamentary activity; it called for action 
committees in the factories, streets, among the unemployed, etc.</p>

<p class="fst">After the bloody repression of 1921, and during the period of 
economic prosperity, the above named functions became purely theoretical. The 
activity of the factory organizations became solely that of propaganda and 
analysis, that is to say political activity. Many members were discouraged and 
left the movement. As a result of that, too, it meant that the factory was no 
longer the basis of the organization. Meetings began to be held outside the 
factory; on the basis of the district, perhaps in a bar where, German fashion, 
they sang the old workers songs of hope and anger...</p>

<p class="fst">No longer was there a practical difference between KAPD, AAUD and 
AAUD-E. In practice they put forward the same line, and were all political 
groupings whatever they called themselves. Anton Pannekoek, the Dutch Marxist 
who was one of the great theoreticians of council-communism, said in this 
respect:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The AAUD, like the KAPD, is essentially an organization whose 
immediate goal is the revolution. In other times, in a period of decline of the 
revolution, one could not have thought of founding such an organization. But it 
has survived the revolutionary years; the workers who founded it before and 
fought under its flag do not want to let themselves lose the experience of those 
struggles and conserve it like a cutting from a plant for the developments to 
come." [Anton Pannekoek]</p>

<p class="fst">Three political parties of the same colour was two too many!</p>

<p class="fst">With the dangers threatening the working class as the Nazis 
started on the road we know so well today, and with inertia and cowardice of the 
old and powerful 'working class' organizations, there were moves to unity. In 
December 1931, the AAUD (having already separated from the KAPD) fused with the 
AAUD-E. Only a few elements remained in the KAPD, and some from the AAUD-E went 
into the anarchist ranks (the FAUD). But most of the survivors of the factory 
organizations were in a new organization, the KAUD (Kommunistische Arbeiter 
Union Deutschlands) or the Communist Workers Union of Germany. This expressed in 
its title the idea that the organization was no longer a 'general organization' 
of the workers, as the AAUD had been at one time. It united all those workers 
who were declared revolutionaries, consciously communist, but did not claim it 
united all the workers any longer.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h31">The KAUD</a></h3>

<p class="fst">With the change of name, there was a change of conception. Up 
till then, council-communism had only taken note of the 'organised class'. Both 
the AAUD and the AAUD-E had believed from the beginning that it would be they 
who would organise the working class, that millions would rally to them. It was 
an idea close to that of revolutionary syndicalism, which looked forward to 
seeing all the workers join their unions, then the working class would be an 
'organised class'.</p>

<p class="fst">Now, however, the KAUD urged workers to organise for themselves 
their own action committees. No longer was the 'organised' class struggle to 
depend on an organization formed previously to the struggle. In this new 
conception, the 'organised class' became the working class struggling under its 
own leadership.</p>

<p class="fst">This change of conception had other consequences. It affected the 
theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, for instance. If the 'organised 
class' was no longer the exclusive affair of organizations formed before the 
struggle, those organizations were no longer able to be considered as the organs 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus, disappeared one of the causes of dissension: whether the 
KAPD or the AAUD would have to exercise power. It had to be agreed that the 
dictatorship of the proletariat could not be in the hands of specialised 
organizations; it would exist in the hands of the class which was in struggle. 
The task of the new KAUD would amount to communist propaganda, clarifying the 
objectives of the struggle, urging the working class to struggle, principally by 
means of the unofficial strike, and showing it where its strengths and 
weaknesses lay.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h32">Communist Society and the Factory Organisations</a></h3>

<p class="fst">This evolution in ideas had to be accompanied by a revision of 
recognised notions concerning the future communist society. The general ideology 
in political circles accepted by the masses was State Capitalism. There were 
many shades of state capitalism, but state capitalist ideology could be brought 
down to some very simple principles: the state, through nationalisation, through 
planned economy, through social reforms, etc., represented the lever for 
socialism, while parliamentary and trade union action represented the means of 
struggle. According to this theory, the working class had hardly and need to 
struggle as an independent class; instead they should entrust the 'management 
and leadership of the class struggle' to Parliamentary and Trade Union 
commanders. Needless to say, in this ideology, Party and Trade Unions became a 
component part of the State, and the management and leadership of the socialist 
or communist society of the future would be theirs.</p>

<p class="fst">Indeed, during the first phase (following the defeat of the 
revolution in Germany) this tradition still strongly impregnated the conceptions 
of the AAUD, the KAPD and the AAUD-E. All three were in favour of an 
organization 'grouping millions and millions' of workers in order to carry out 
the political and economic dictatorship of the proletariat. In 1922, for 
instance the AAUD declared that it was in a position to take over, on its 
reckoning, based on its active membership, '6% of the factories' of Germany.</p>

<p class="fst">But these conceptions altered. When there were hundreds of 
factory organizations, united and co-ordinated by the AAUD and AAUD-E, they 
could demand the maximum of independence as to the decisions they took and avoid 
'a new clique of leaders'.</p>

<p class="fst">But it was asked whether it was possible to preserve this 
independence in the midst of communist social life?</p>

<p class="fst">Economic life is highly specialised, and all enterprises are 
directly interdependent. How could economic life be administered if the 
production and distribution of social wealth are not sometimes in centralised 
forms? Was the State dispensable or indispensable as a regulator of production 
and organization?</p>

<p class="fst">It is easy to see there was a contradiction between the old idea 
of communist society and the new form of society that was now proposed. While 
there was fear of economic centralization, it was not clear how to guard against 
it. There was discussion about the greater or lesser degree of 'federalism' or 
'centralism': the AAUD-E leaned rather more towards federalism, the KAPD &#8211; AAUD 
leaned more towards centralism. In 1923, Karl Schröder (1884-1950, Spartacist 
fighter with a price on his head, then a professional leader of the KAPD, was 
expelled from the KAPD in 1924; later he became an official of the Socialist 
Party. He was one of the few of his party to organise 'resistance' to Nazism. 
Imprisoned in 1936 with other KAPD veterans, he is today one of the German 
Socialist 'martyrs') the theoretician of the KAPD, proclaimed that 'the more 
centralised communist society is, the better it will be'.</p>

<p class="fst">In fact, as long as one remained on the basis of the old 
conceptions of the 'organised class', this contradiction was insoluble. One side 
rallied more or less to the revolutionary syndicalist conception of 'taking 
over' the factories through the unions; the other, like the Bolsheviks, thought 
that a centralised apparatus, the state, must regulate the process of 
distribution and production, and distribute the 'national income' among the 
workers.</p>

<p class="fst">But to discuss the communist society on the basis of 'federalism 
or centralism' is sterile. These are problems of organization, technical 
problems, while communist society is basically an economic problem. Capitalism 
must give way to another economic system, where the means of production, the 
products of labour power, do not take the form of 'value' and where the 
exploitation of the working population to the profit of privileged layers has 
disappeared.</p>

<p class="fst">The problem of 'federalism or centralism' is devoid of sense if 
it has not been shown beforehand what the form of organization and its economic 
basis will be. Forms of organization are not arbitrary: they derive from the 
very principles of the economy. For example, the principle of profit and surplus 
value, of its private or collective appropriation, lies at the bottom of all 
forms of capitalist economy. That is why it is insufficient to present communist 
economy as a negative system: no money, no market, no private or State property. 
It is necessary to show up its positive character, to show what will be the 
economic laws which will succeed those of capitalism. This done, it may well be 
that the problem of 'federalism or centralism' is no problem at all.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h33">The End of the Movement in Germany</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The AAUD had separated from the KAPD at the end of 1929. Its 
press then advocated a 'flexible tactic'; support of workers struggles solely 
for wage demands, the improvement of conditions or hours of work. More rigidly, 
the KAPD saw in this tactic the bait for a slide towards class collaboration, 
'horse-trading' (<i>Kuhhandel</i>) politics. After expelling its leader Adam 
Scharrer for 'making a pact with the enemy' (i.e., having a novel published by 
the German Communist Party publishing house), (Adam Scharrer, 1889-1948, 
metalworker, Spartacist fighter, afterwards professional leader of the KAPD from 
which he was expelled in 1930. A novelist like Schrader, he lived in Moscow 
after 1934. He later moved to what was East Germany where he was regarded as a 
'pioneer of proletarian literature'. Needless to say, some features of his past 
life were not exactly advertised.) &#8211; the KAPD turned to the advocacy of 
individual terrorism. One of those who accepted this idea was Marinus Van der 
Lubbe. In setting fire to the premises housing the Nazi Parliament, and burning 
down the <i>Reichstag</i>, he wished by a symbolic gesture to urge the workers 
to abandon their political apathy and rise against the Nazis. (It should be 
noted in passing that effective Stalinist propaganda has all but obscured the 
heroic role of Van der Lubbe, who in English speaking countries at least, has 
been classified almost as a Nazi stool pigeon &#8211; a slander begun by Dimitrov and 
Thälmann, Communist leaders, in their defence.)</p>

<p class="fst">But neither tactic had any results in any case. Germany had gone 
through an economic crisis of major depth. There was huge army of the 
unemployed. Unofficial strikes became impossible. While it was true that nobody 
any longer thought of obeying their trade unions, the latter were collaborating 
directly with the employers and the state. The press of the council communists 
was frequently seized. The supreme irony was that the only great unofficial 
strike of that period &#8211; the transport workers of Berlin in 1932 &#8211; was organised 
by the Stalinist and Hitler high priests acting together against the high 
priests of the Socialist trade unions.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<h2><a name="h34">3. After Hitler</a></h2>

<p class="fst">After Hitler's rise to power, the militants of all tendencies 
were hunted down and imprisoned in concentration camps where large numbers 
disappeared. In 1945, some survivors were executed, on the orders of the GPU 
(Russian Military Intelligence) when the Red Army entered Saxony. As late as 
1952, in West Berlin, one of the old leaders of the AAUD, Alfred Weiland, was 
kidnapped in the open street and taken to the East, where he suffered a heavy 
term of imprisonment. No trace remained of this movement of workers' councils. 
The men were liquidated and so were their ideas. Commercial expansion and 
prosperity directed feelings elsewhere. How has this movement enriched our 
knowledge of the struggle for workers power?</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h35">The Economic Foundations of Worker Power</a></h3>

<p class="fst">To understand the fundamental economy of communism, the AAUD had 
to be freed from the old traditions of the 'organised class', and to understand 
that the working class could only achieve its real unity in the mass all 
embracing struggle without the need for a specialised organization which at best 
could only represent a fragmentary part of what the total proletarian aspiration 
consists of. In 1930 it published a study (drawn up by the Dutch Council 
Communist Group) on <i><a href="../1930/index.htm">Fundamental Principles of Communist Production and 
Distribution</a></i>.</p>

<p class="fst">This analysis did not propose a 'plan' of any kind, to show how 
it would be possible to build a 'finer', more 'equitable' society. It concerned 
itself only with the problems of organization of the communist economy as an 
organic whole, the practice of class struggle and social administration. The <i>
Principles</i> give a theoretical idea of the economic consequences of the 
struggle by the independent mass movement at a political level.</p>

<p class="fst">When the workers' councils have taken power, they will have 
learned to 'manage their own struggle' directly, and they will be obliged to 
give a new basis to their power by introducing new economic laws by which the 
measure of labour time will be the pivot of all production and distribution of 
all social products. The workers are able to run production themselves, but only 
through calculating labour time in different branches of production, and dividing 
produce by this means.</p>

<p class="fst">The <i>Principles</i> examine this problem from the viewpoint of 
the exploited worker who not only aims at the abolition of private property, but 
also of exploitation in general. The history of our times has shown that the 
suppression of private property does not necessarily mean the end of 
exploitation.</p>

<p class="fst">The Anarchist movement understood this fact much sooner than the 
Marxists, and its theoreticians have given it careful attention. In the last 
analysis, they came to the same conclusion. But whereas the Marxists (Social 
Democrats or Bolsheviks) wanted to put capitalism, which had reached the 
monopoly stage, under the so called workers state, without changing anything 
fundamental in its mechanism, the Anarchists advocated a federation of free 
communes and rejected every form of state.</p>

<p class="fst">One of the best known Anarchist theoreticians, Sebastian Faure 
(My Communism, Faure, Paris, 1921) stated that the members of a commune would 
have to take a census of their needs and their productive possibilities; then 
with 'the whole of needs of consumers and possibilities of producers at the 
regional level at their disposal.... the National Committee could set and make 
known to each Regional Committee what quantities of products its region can 
dispose of and what productive total it must provide. Equipped with this 
knowledge, each Regional Committee can do the same work for its region: set and 
make known to each communal committee what its commune has to dispose of and 
what it can provide. The last named does the same with the members of the 
commune.'</p>

<p class="fst">Sebastian Faure had earlier advocated the "all this organization 
has as the basic and vital principle of Free Agreement as its cornerstone." 
However, an economic system requires economic principles and not noble 
proclamations. One can say with the same with respect to the following quotation 
from Hilferding, the famous Social Democrat theoretician, for here also economic 
principle is lacking; "the communal, regional and national commissioners of the 
socialist society decide how and where, in what quantity and by what means, new 
products will be obtained from natural or artificial conditions of production. 
With the help of statistics of production and consumption covering the whole of 
society's needs, they change the whole of economic life according to the needs 
expressed by these statistics."</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h36">Hilferding - Das Finanzkapital</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The difference between these two fundamental points of view is 
not very noticeable. (Indeed, Lenin expresses much the same views in State and 
Revolution, only in more simple and forceful terms.) However, the Anarchists had 
the historic merit of advancing the essential slogan &#8211; "Abolition of the Wages 
System!". In this perspective, however, the 'National Committee', the 'office of 
statistics' etc., that which the Marxists had hitherto referred to as the 
'People's Government' is supposed to practice 'natural economics', i.e., an 
economy without money circulating. Housing, food, electric current, transport &#8211; 
all this is 'free'. A certain portion of goods and services remain payable in 
money (generally indexed upon the relationship between population and 
consumption).</p>

<p class="fst">But despite appearances, this manner of suppressing the wages 
system does not signify either the abolition of exploitation nor social freedom. 
In fact, the larger becomes the 'natural' sector of the economy, the more the 
workers depend on the fixing of their 'incomes' by the apparatus of 
distribution.</p>

<p class="fst">We have an instance of a 'moneyless' economy, where exchange was 
carried out in great part 'naturally' &#8211; in so far as housing, lighting etc. were 
concerned, all was 'free' &#8211; and that was in the period of 'war communism' in 
Russia. This showed quite clearly that not only was the system not permanently 
viable, but moreover that it could co-exist with a regime based on class 
domination.</p>

<p class="fst">Reality has taught us:</p>

<p class="indentb">- first, that it is possible to abolish private property in 
the means of production without abolishing exploitation;</p>

<p class="indentb">- secondly, that it is possible to abolish the wages system 
without abolishing exploitation.</p>

<p class="fst">If this is so, the problem of the proletarian revolution is posed 
in the following terms:</p>

<p class="indentb">- what are the economic conditions that allow the abolition 
of exploitation?</p>

<p class="indentb">- what are the economic conditions that allow the proletariat 
to maintain power once the latter is won, and to lay the axe to the economic 
roots of the counter-revolution?</p>

<p class="fst">While the <i>Principles</i> study the economic foundations of 
communism, the point of departure is more political than economic. For the 
workers it is not easy to seize political power, but it is still more difficult 
to maintain it. The present day conceptions of socialism and communism tend to 
concentrate (in fact if not in theory) all powers of administration either in 
the State or in certain social offices. But, according to the <i>Principles</i>, 
the communist economy is the extension of the revolution and not some desirable 
state of affairs that may be realised in a hundred or a thousand years. It seeks 
to define at the level of principles the measures to be taken, not by some party 
or organization but by THE WORKING CLASS ITSELF AND ITS IMMEDIATE ORGANS OF 
STRUGGLE: THE WORKERS' COUNCILS. The realisation of communism is not the 
business of a party, but that of the whole working class, acting and 
deliberating through its councils.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h37">Production and Social Wealth</a></h3>

<p class="fst">One of the great problems of the revolution, is how to set up new 
relations between the producer and social wealth-relations which (within 
capitalist society) are expressed in the wages system. The wages system is based 
on an antagonism between the value of labour power (wages) and labour itself (its 
product). If for example the worker provides 50 hours work for society, the 
wages are only equivalent to 10 hours. In order to gain emancipation the worker 
must ensure that it is not the value of labour power which decides the pay that 
is received as a share of social production, but that this share is fixed by 
that labour itself. Labour equals measure of consumption: that is the principle 
that must be established.</p>

<p class="fst">The difference between the sum of labour provided and what the 
worker collects in exchange is called surplus labour and represents unpaid 
labour. The social wealth produced during this labour time is the surplus product 
and the value embedded in this surplus product is called surplus value. Every 
society, whatever it is, and therefore also communist society, rests on the 
formation of a surplus product, because out of the workers as a whole producing 
necessary or useful labour, some do not produce tangible goods. Their conditions 
of life are produced by other workers (the same is true for the health services, 
the care of the sick and old, the administrative services, education etc.) But 
it is the manner in which this surplus product is formed, and that in which it 
is distributed, that constitutes capitalist exploitation.</p>

<p class="fst">The worker receives a wage which may suffice a life after and up 
to a certain fashion. It is known say, that 50 hours work has been done in a 
time period (a month, for example) but it is not known how many hours accrue as 
wages. The worker is unconscious of the amount of surplus labour. It is known how 
the possessing class consumes this product: apart from the social services, 
which receive a part of it, it goes back to capitalise expansion, it enables the 
life of the exploiters, it pays for the (not inconsiderable) cost of the 
Government including the police and the army.</p>

<p class="fst">There are two particular characteristics of this surplus product: 
first, the fact that the working class has not, or has almost never, the 
decision on the product of this unpaid work. We receive a wage full stop. We can 
do nothing about the production and distribution of social wealth. The class 
that hold the means of production, the possessing class, is master of the labour 
process, including surplus labour; it puts us out of work when it deems it 
necessary to its interests, it bludgeons us with its police or makes us cannon 
fodder in its wars. The authority of the bourgeoisie rests in the fact that it 
possesses labour, surplus labour, the surplus product. It is this that makes the 
working class an impotent class in society; an oppressed class.</p>

<p class="fst">It was often said of course, that there was no more exploitation 
of the workers in Russia, because private capital had been abolished and the 
whole of the surplus product was possessed and controlled by the state, which 
distributed it within society through new social laws and new factories, etc..</p>

<p class="fst">Let us accept this argument for a moment; leaving aside, 
therefore, the fact that the dominant class, the bureaucracy, has enriched 
itself by exorbitant salaries, and maintained (and still maintains) itself in 
power by assuring higher education to its children and by laws of succession 
that guarantee wealth accumulated 'for the family'. Let even suppose that it is 
not the case that this bureaucracy exploits the population. It is still a fact 
that the bureaucracy in Russia remains master of the labour process, including 
surplus labour. It dictates, through the State unions, the conditions of work, 
just as much as is done in the West.</p>

<p class="fst">If the bureaucracy did not exploit the population, it would only 
be by its 'goodwill': by its refusal to exploit; by its generosity in not taking 
advantage of its position. A society on such lines would no longer be subject to 
social and economic necessity, but depend on the 'good' or 'bad' sentiments of 
its rulers. The conditions of the workers in so far as their relationship to 
social wealth was concerned, would be the same, that is it would be arbitrarily 
fixed; and they could not do anything about it, except perhaps to hope that 
'bad' rulers might become more tolerant and become 'good' rulers.</p>

<p class="fst">In short the abolition of the wages system is not the ONLY and 
necessary condition of the workers receiving the share of the social product 
which accrues to them and which their labour has created. This share can 
increase; but a true abolition of wage exploitation of any nature is something 
entirely different. Without this true abolition of wage exploitation, a 
revolution must degenerate. And the revolution 'betrayed' will lead to a 
totalitarian capitalist state.</p>

<p class="fst">One further conclusion is drawn in the <i>Principles</i>. A 
revolutionary group of workers that wishes radically to end capitalist 
exploitation must seek the means to establish economically the power won 
politically. The time is past when all that mattered was to demand the end of 
private property in the means of production. It is also not enough to call for 
the abolition of the wages system. This demand in itself is of no consequence 
whatever, if nobody knows how to run a society without wages. A group that could 
not clarify this question has nothing to say about building the new society.</p>

<h3><a name="h38">The Measurement of Labour</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The <i>Principles of Communist Production and Distribution</i> 
starts from the following idea: all goods produced by labour are of equal 
qualitative value, for they all represent a portion of human labour. Only the 
quantity of different labour which they represent makes them different. The 
measure of time which each worker individually devotes to labour is the hour of 
labour. Likewise, the measure destined to measure the quantity or time that 
such-and-such an object represents, must be the hour of average social labour.</p>

<p class="fst">It is this measure which establishes the sum of wealth that 
society has, likewise the relationship between the various enterprises, and 
finally, the share of this wealth per worker. On this basis the <i>Principles</i> 
develops an analysis and a criticism of the different theories &#8211; and also 
practices &#8211; of the different currents which refer to Marxism, Anarchism or 
Socialism, in general. They contain a more precise exposition of the concise 
principles of Marx and Engels as laid down in Capital, The Critique of the Gotha 
Programme and Anti-Dühring.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course the <i>Principles</i> does not only study the unit of 
calculation under communism: it also analyses the application of this to the 
production and distribution of the social product, and in the 'public services', 
examining the new rules of social book keeping, the increase of production and 
its control by the workers; the disappearance of the Stock Exchange and the 
application of communism in agricultural co-operatives which themselves 
calculate their harvests in labour time.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus the <i>Principles</i> show that on the taking of power by 
the proletariat, the means of production lies in the hands of its functional 
organizations. It is on the communistic consciousness of workers themselves, 
born out of their own struggle, that the ultimate fate of these means of 
production will depend; whether the working class keeps them in their own hands 
or not.</p>

<p class="fst">Above all, the proletarian revolution will fix unalterable 
relationships between production and producer, which can only be done by 
introducing the calculation of labour-time into production and distribution. This 
is the highest demand the proletariat can formulate ... and at the same time it 
is the minimum upon which it can insist. The proletariat can keep hold of these 
enterprises only if it makes sure to keep the autonomous direction and 
administration of them at factory level. It must apply everywhere the 
calculation of labour time.</p>

<p class="fst">Such is the final message left to the world by the German 
revolutionary proletarian movement of the first half of the twentieth century.</p>

<h2><a name="h39">Appendix 1</a></h2>

<p class="fst">There was some international influence of the German Council 
communist movement of the 1920s. In particular, the 'ultra left' ideas of the 
KAPD spread &#8211; they were the first to suggest a Fourth International, an idea 
taken up by the Trotskyists after their break with Moscow.</p>

<p class="fst">In Russia, the Workers Opposition (Shliapnikov, Alexandra 
Kollontai, etc.) kept in contact with the KAPD but finally integrated into the 
Bolshevik party. Sympathetic groups existed in the Balkans (Greece, Romania and 
what was Yugoslavia, where one of their leaders was betrayed to the police by 
the Leninists) especially in Bulgaria, where a strong tendency existed of direct 
action and individual terrorism as against Leninist parliamentarism 
(insurrection of 1923, dynamiting of bridges, blowing up in 1925 of Sofia 
cathedral).</p>

<p class="fst">There were groups in Belgium and Holland in particular, 
originally around Gorter, later in the International Communist group (GIK-H). 
The last active council communist groupings existed in Holland, where the <i>
Principles</i> was produced, as a collective effort by German and Dutch workers. 
(<i>Grundprinzipien der Kommunsitischen Produktion und Verteilung</i>, 1930.)</p>

<p class="fst">There were others which had a sporadic existence in Czechslovakia, 
Denmark, France (around Andre Prudhommeaux, who later went over to Anarchism), 
in the United States (around ex-KAPDer, Paul Mattick and the reviews <i>
International Council Correspondence</i>, <i>Living Marxism</i>, and <i>New 
Essays</i>), in Australia, the journal <i>Southern Advocate for Workers' 
Councils</i> &#8211; which published the basic work of Anton Pannekoek, Workers 
Councils (Melbourne, 1950).</p>

<p class="fst">In Britain, there was originally an active movement that included 
Sylvia Pankhurst and the <i>Workers Dreadnought</i>, who raised many of the 
issues during the negotiations to found the Communist Party in this country. (A 
real appraisal of the foundation of the CPGB has still to be made.) Willie 
Gallagher, later a 'Communist' MP, sided with the 'Lefts' as a young man, and 
was lectured by Lenin at the Second Congress of the Third International in 1921 
into giving up his opposition to Parliamentary Politics. The most consistent 
advocate of council communism in this country was Guy Aldred, and a movement was 
kept alive under his influence in Glasgow for many years, known as the <i>
Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation</i>.</p>

<h5><a name="h41">Origins of the KAPD</a></h5>

<p class="fst">On December 5th 1920, the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD) 
was recognised as a sympathising Party of the Third International. The KAPD and 
its programme is in direct opposition to the VKPD (<i>Vereinigte</i> or Unified 
Communist Party of Germany) which was formed in November 1920 form the Left USPD 
and the former <i>Spartakus-Bund</i> (KPD) and which belongs to the Third 
International as a fully recognised section. The KAPD is in also in complete 
opposition to the tactics of the Third International, as laid down in the <i>
Theses of the Second Congress</i>. The KAPD sees in these tactics the terrible 
danger of opportunism pure and simple; the danger of an opportunism which will 
lead the Revolution into a morass and will thus prove disastrous to Russia 
herself.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD has arisen out of the former opposition in the <i>
Spartakus-Bund</i>. The executive of the KPD, with Russia's help thrives. It is 
the strongest and largest section of the Party, and the spirit of 
Parliamentarism has gained in their leaders, Levi, Thalheimer, Kickert and 
others, under the influence of Radek and Bronski.</p>

<p class="fst">Every means has been used to destroy the KAPD. Nevertheless, it 
has gained in strength and had to perforce be recognised by the Third 
International as a sympathising Party, with the right of having a permanent 
Advisory Representative on the Executive.</p>

<h5><a name="h42">The Greatness of the Third International</a></h5>

<p class="fst">The KAPD, which had always recognised the fundamental greatness 
of the idea underlying the Third International and the necessity for unity with 
Soviet Russia, is determined to fight opportunism by uniting all the forces of 
the opposition for a persistent struggle inside the Third International, coupled 
with a thorough revision of the <i>Theses</i> in a Marxist revolutionary sense 
as its next aim.</p>

<p class="fst">Its full views are laid down in an <i>Open Letter to Comrade 
Lenin</i> ("An Open Letter to Comrade Lenin: An Answer to Lenin's Pamphlet <i>
Infantile Sickness of Leftism in Communism</i>", published by the KAPD, Berlin). 
We must also at this juncture, raise the following essential points which, 
however, cannot be discussed and justified in detail: in Western Europe, we have 
in contradistinction to the overwhelmingly agrarian East, other production 
conditions, and hence, other class conditions and a different spiritual 
structure. Western Europe is dominated by Banking interests and Capital which 
keep the gigantic proletariat in spiritual and material slavery, and which unite 
all the bourgeois and petty bourgeois classes. This forces the proletarian 
masses to independent action which in the Revolution can only be achieved by 
industrial organization and by the Abolition of Parliamentarism.</p>

<h5><a name="h43">Points of Difference</a></h5>

<p class="fst">The Third International believes that the Revolution in Western 
Europe will follow the line of the Russian Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD believes that the Revolution in Western Europe will lay 
down and follow its own laws.</p>

<p class="fst">The Third International believes that the Revolution In Western 
Europe will be able to follow a policy of compromise and alliance with petty 
peasants, petty bourgeois and even bourgeois parties.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD believes this is impossible.</p>

<p class="fst">The Third International 
believes in the inevitability (during the Revolution) of splits and dissensions 
between the bourgeois, petty bourgeois and petty peasant.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD believes that the bourgeois and the petty bourgeois will 
form a united front against the proletariat right up to the end of the 
Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The Third International underestimates the power of North 
American and Western capital.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD formulates its tactics according to those of that great 
power.</p>

<p class="fst">The Third International does not recognise the power of the Banks 
and of Big Business, which unites all bourgeois classes.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD on the other hand builds up its tactics on this unifying 
power of Capital.</p>

<p class="fst">Not believing in the capacity of the West European proletariat to 
stand alone, the Third International neglects the spiritual and intellectual 
development of this proletariat which in every sphere is, after all, still 
imbued with bourgeois ideology and chooses tactics which allow slavery and 
subordination to bourgeois ideas to be maintained.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD chooses its tactics with the main object of setting free 
the spirit of the proletariat, owing to the fact that the Third International 
does not base its tactics on liberation of the spirit, nor in the unity of all 
bourgeois and petty bourgeois parties, but on compromises and 'splits' it 
allowed the old trade unions to exist and endeavours to receive them into the 
Third International.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD, whose first aim is liberation of the spirit, and which 
believes in the unity of the bourgeois, recognises that trade unions must be 
destroyed and that the proletariat requires better weapons than the General 
Workers Union in Germany.</p>

<p class="fst">For the same reasons that the Third International allows 
Parliamentarism to remain, for these very same reasons the KAPD abolishes 
Parliamentarism. It pulls up evil by the roots.</p>

<p class="fst">Owing to the fact that the Third International does not believe 
that liberation of the spirit is the first essential in Western Europe, and does 
not believe the bourgeoisie has a United Front in the Revolution, it takes 
within its fold masses without ascertaining whether they are really communistic, 
without demanding from them tactics which would prove that they are Communists 
and not just masses.</p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD wishes to form Parties in every country which consist of 
Communists only, and formulates its tactics accordingly.</p>

<p class="fst">Through the example of these Parties, small at the beginning, it 
will turn the majority of the proletariat <i>viz</i>. the masses into 
Communists.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus, the masses of Western Europe are to the Third International 
the means; to the KAPD they are the end. Through these tactics (which were the 
right ones in Russia) the Third International has adopted a leaders policy. The 
KAPD, on the other hand, conducts a masses policy.</p>

<p class="fst">Comrades, Proletarians. The KAPD holds the belief that all of 
these are vital questions of the proletarian revolution. In the middle of 
February there will take place a Party Meeting of the KAPD at which special 
attention will be paid to the tactics of the Third International. You are 
cordially invited to take your part in it, we beg you to communicate this 
invitation to your members.</p>
