<h4>CHAPTER 11</h4>
<h1><a name="h0">The System of Control over the Establishments for General Social Use 
(G.S.U.), or Public Establishments</a></h1>

<p class="fst">Control over the GSU (public) establishments runs to a certain 
extent parallel with that of the productive establishments. This applies 
particularly to the supervision of the separate categories making up the 
production formula (p + c) + L, which takes place through the registration of 
use-values and the distribution of labour-certificates. To this extent control 
arises spontaneously out of the objective process of production itself.</p>

<p class="fst">The output produced by these establishments, however, passes over 
to society <i>without compensation</i>, and thus they receive no credit entry 
for this either in the books of the establishment or in the office of social 
book-keeping. In these cases neither the quantity of product produced - that is 
to say, their Average Social Production Time (ASPT) - nor the reproduction 
process (extended accumulation) assumes the role of the controlling factor. 
Those establishments, therefore, which yield up their product for individual 
consumption without any economic measure are subject to automatic control in 
only one direction: that provided by the objective or impersonal aspect of the 
production process alone, since the aspect of labour-time expended (L) is not 
measured. It is, of course, possible to conceive of a myriad of methods by means 
of which these establishments could be brought systematically under control, in 
order to ensure that social resources are administered as sparingly and 
economically as possible. The point, however, is not to devise out of the top of 
one's head methods of control which would presumably correspond with the 
specific characteristics of the particular establishment in question; on the 
contrary, the task is precisely that of determining that particular form of 
control which reflects organically the character of social production as a whole 
and so is common to all establishments.</p>

<p class="fst">In an early inceptive period of a communist economy, it would be 
likely that only those establishments would belong to the type of GSU or 
"public" establishments which produce no physical product, such as for instance 
the economic and political councils, the health service, the education system, 
etc. The next stage of development would then likely be that of bringing the 
transport of goods and passengers into the sphere of uncompensated consumption. 
At a still more distant stage, the principle of "consumption according to need" 
might be extended to physically definable and measurable products destined for 
individual consumption. In the course of carrying through the social revolution, 
the first concern is therefore not with the immediate implementation to the 
greatest possible extent of the principle "to each according to his needs", <i>
but with the achievement of independent administration on the part of the 
productive establishments and the carrying through of a system of independent 
production accounting and control</i>. So soon as production is secured in this 
respect, the further development of the economy to the stage of free and 
uncompensated consumption becomes a relatively simple matter.</p>

<p class="fst">In the case of all those establishments which permit of automatic 
control in only one direction, it is likely that the missing sphere of control 
would be made good by means of on-the-spot investigative comparisons. 
Comparisons of operative indices would, for instance, be instituted in order to 
determine how many labour-hours were being devoted to education in one or the 
other commune, how many labour-hours were consumed in the various cities in 
providing and servicing one kilometre of public roadway, and so on. In those 
cases in which a physically measurable product is distributed socially - for 
instance, electricity - control by means of the average social labour-time 
expended would once again become applicable. Now, however, it would have to be 
borne in mind that control would not be carried through automatically as a 
planned element in the work of the office of social book-keeping, but must now 
take place in the book-keeping department of the establishment concerned.</p>

<p class="fst">As a subordinate task within the general system of control 
exercised over the public establishments, there now also arises the need for <i>
control over the distribution of consumption goods</i>. The consumers distribute 
the products themselves independently through the agency of their cooperatives, 
they are "masters in their own house". Because individual wishes here find 
collective expression, it is they who determine exactly what and how much is to 
be distributed. Their executive organ is an establishment of the GSU type, which 
draws up an operational budget defining its consumption of (p + c) + L and which 
defines its functional service as consisting in the distribution of x 
labour-hours.</p>

<p class="fst">Control over the production formula is again effected in pursuit 
of one purpose only: that of determining whether or not the limits laid down for 
the specific categories making up the production formula are being maintained - 
both of these yielding, as a by-product, data confirming or denying that the 
production formula had been correctly drawn up in the first place.</p>

<p class="fst">The question of control over the quantity of product distributed 
is also a relatively simple matter, precisely because all transfers of goods are 
registered in the system of general social book-keeping and because the products 
pass into the sphere of consumption in exact accordance with their production 
times. In the office of social book-keeping an exact record is maintained as to 
how much product, that is to say how many labour-hours, have been drawn upon to 
the account of each consumer cooperative. Labour certificates to exactly the 
same value in labour-hours must have been surrendered to the office of social 
book-keeping.</p>

<p class="fst">There are, of course certain technical difficulties associated 
with this procedure. For instance, the distributive organisations must take into 
account the fact that a portion of the available product will be lost, destroyed 
or damaged. For this reason it can it practice never arise that exactly the same 
quantity of labour certificates will have been surrendered as corresponds to the 
equivalent debit with the office of social book-keeping. The limits within which 
these deficits should move are, however, easy to determine in practice and for 
that reason can, be adopted, for instance, as a category in the operative budget 
of the distributive organisation. Control over the processes of distribution is 
not in principle jeopardised by these unavoidable product losses, and the 
principle of an exact relationship of the producer to the product is not thereby 
infringed.</p>

<p class="fst">By this means control over both production and distribution is 
complete. Each category of the production-reproduction formula can be exactly 
scrutinised by society. Control is reduced to its simplest possible form and the 
economic process is so clearly perceivable that the system of <i>open 
book-keeping</i> makes direct control on the part of all members of society 
possible.</p>

<p class="fst">With the combined apparatus of production and distribution, the 
total economic system, firmly and permanently in the hands of the 
producer-consumers, the apparatus of the economic system of communism has found 
its highest and most ideal unified form, which can come into being only through 
the integrated operation of all productive forces, and can indeed be nothing 
other than this. Society thus becomes <i>THE ASSOCIATION OF FREE AND EQUAL 
PRODUCERS</i>. In the socio-political sphere this finds its highest expression 
in the system of Workers' Councils, and in the economic sphere in the system of 
General Social Book-keeping.</p>
