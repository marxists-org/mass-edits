<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">1. Marx's <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i></a></h3>

<p class="fst">It is now high time for the revolutionary proletariat finally to 
acquire a definite conception of the social order with which it intends to 
replace capitalism. It no longer suffices to push this task to one side with 
such facile remarks as that "the victorious working class will develop hitherto 
undreamed of powers, once it has struck off the fetters which at present bind 
it". For one thing, this is an extremely uncertain vision of the future. More to 
the point, it is in any case quite irrelevant. Indeed the opposite is true. Each 
day brings fresh evidence to prove that the capitalist economy is moving with 
giant strides along the path of concentration, and only those afflicted with 
blindness could fail to recognise that sooner or later it will find its highest 
and most complete form in the State. This then is the path of development by 
which the power of capital reaches its ultimate degree of concentration, and it 
functions simultaneously as the form of alliance binding together all sections 
of the ruling class, including the leadership levels of the old workers' 
organisations, against the proletariat. It is in this direction that the 
propaganda conducted on the broadest possible basis by Social Democracy and the 
trade unions on behalf of "economic democracy" - a propaganda which would be 
better described as the opening up of measures to enable the leaderships of the 
old workers' organisations to exercise a degree of control over the economy 
through the agency of the State - is aimed. The old workers' movement is 
unfolding its economic programme, its proposed planned economy, and its 
"socialism" thereby acquires form and structure; but what becomes amply clear 
along with these revelations is that the proposals put forward represent no more 
than <i>a continuation of wage-labour under a new guise</i>. And now it is also 
possible to declare with certainty that so-called Russian State communism is no 
more than a somewhat more radical means of implementing this new form of 
wage-labour. We revolutionary proletarians therefore have no choice. Before the 
eyes of the broad masses of the working class a way forward for their actions 
and struggles is being presented which will allegedly lead then to socialism or 
communism, to their liberation. And it is these selfsame masses of workers whom 
we must win to our side, to whom we must show their own autonomous goal, for 
without whom there can be no revolution and no communism. And this in its turn 
we can only do when we ourselves have a clear conception of the mode of 
production and structure of the communist society for which we fight, and for 
which we are prepared to devote our lives.</p>

<p class="fst">There is however yet more to be said on this theme. Even 
bourgeois scientists have recognised the approaching catastrophe, and they are 
even now preparing the reconciliation of capital with the idea of a socialised 
economy. They recognise that the days of private economic management are 
numbered and that the time has come when thought should be devoted to the task 
of maintaining exploitation by means of new forms of socialised management. 
Characteristic of this tendency is a work by the bourgeois economist E. Horn: <i>
The Economic Limits of the Socialised Economy</i>, in which the view is 
expressed that the abolition of private property in means of production does not 
necessarily entail the end of capitalist production. It is for this reason that, 
in the final analysis, the elimination of private property in means of 
production holds no fears for him at least, because according to his view the 
whole capitalist mode of production, together with its market mechanism and the 
process of surplus-value formation, must be maintained at all costs. For him the 
problem is not <i>whether</i> but <i>how</i> private property in means of 
production is to be made obsolete.</p>

<p class="fst">It is of course axiomatic for a bourgeois economist such as E. 
Horn to attempt to prove the impossibility of communism. The fact that he seeks 
to achieve this by reference to the theory of marginal utility developed by 
Böhm-Bawerk renders it unnecessary for us to examine this in any greater detail. 
In our opinion, N. Bukharin has done everything that is necessary towards the 
refutation of this theory in the book <i>Die politische Oekonomie des Rentners 
(The Political Economy of the Rentier Class)</i>. But the manner in which Horn 
criticised the official theory of the communist economy is worthy of note. He 
describes this as an economic order with <i>negative characteristics</i>, 
because, in that official theory, communism is defined by what it is <i>not</i>, 
and never, in no single case, <i>according to the actual categories by means of 
which this economy will be ordered</i>. The characteristics of the communist 
economy are stated as being that it has <i>no market</i>, <i>no prices and no 
money</i>. In other words, everything is <i>negatively defined</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The spontaneous activities of the workers in their role as 
producer-distributors will fill out the spaces left by this negative 
characterisation, replies Neurath; Hilferding for his part refers this task to 
the State commissars with their statistical apparatus governing production and 
consumption; as a final resort, refuge is sought in fulsome references to "the 
creative energies of the victorious proletariat", which will solve problems "at 
the flick of a wrist...". Here we have reached the fitting point at which to 
recall the old adage: "When concepts fail to correspond with reality, at the 
critical moment the imagination supplies the appropriate word".</p>

<p class="fst">It may at first glance appear surprising that the so-called 
marxist economists have paid so little attention to the categories of communist 
economy, in spite of the fact that Marx himself has set down his views 
concerning this in a more or less complete, even if extremely condensed, form in 
his <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i>. Only, however, at first glance. The 
"disciples" of Marx did not know what to make of his grandiose vision, because 
they believed that they had made the discovery that the basic preconditions for 
the administration and management of the communist economy would develop along 
lines so completely different from those conceived by Marx. His "Association of 
Free and Equal Producers" was transformed in their hands into "State 
nationalisation", for did not the very process of capital concentration organic 
to the capitalist economy lead with absolute certainty to this end? However, the 
revolutionary years 1917-23 revealed for all to see the forms through which the 
proletariat seizes control of the means of production, and the Russian 
Revolution proved that two opposite perspectives lay at the heart of the 
revolutionary development there: either the Workers' Councils succeed in 
maintaining their power in society, or that power falls into the hands of the 
centralised economic organs of the State. Thus the broad lines of development of 
the communist society as set forth by Marx have once again proved themselves to 
be correct.</p>

<p class="fst">Concerning the <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i>, the 
following information is relevant: in the year 1875, measures were set in 
motion to bring about a fusion of the General Workers' Union of Germany, which 
as a general rule followed the doctrines propagated by Ferdinand Lassalle, with 
the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany, for which purpose a draft of 
the Programme to be presented for adoption at the Unity Congress, to be held at 
the small Thuringian town of Gotha, was drawn up. Both Marx and Engels subjected 
this draft to an annihilating criticism. Marx expressed his criticism in a 
letter to Brake, and subsequently named this manuscript <i>Marginal Notes on the 
Coalition Programme</i>. It was only after 1891 that this criticism became more 
widely known, and this happened when Engels was instrumental in bringing about 
its publication in <i>Neue Zeit</i> (<i>New Times</i>), Vol 9, pp. 561-575. For 
many years, nothing more was heard about the matter until in 1920, again in 1922 
and then in 1928, new editions of this text were published (all relevant dates 
have been taken from <i>Program-Kritiken</i> (<i>Critical Notes on the Programme</i>), 
or, as it is better known in English, the <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i>. 
In fact, these "Marginal Notes" only came to our notice <i>after</i> we had 
concluded our study. They correspond so closely with the outline given here that 
our work to some extent appeared as if it were no more than a contemporary 
elaboration of Marx's conception. We will content ourselves with showing but one 
example of this close correspondence, namely at that point in Marx's text where 
Marx polemicises against the view, taken by the Unity Programme, that each 
worker should receive the "undiminished proceeds of his labour":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Let us take first of all the words 'proceeds of labour' in the 
sense of the product of labour; then the cooperative proceeds of labour are the <i>
total social product</i>.</p>

<p class="quoteb">From this must now be deducted:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>First</i>, cover for replacement of the means of production 
used up.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Secondly</i>, additional portion for expansion of production.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Thirdly</i>, reserve or insurance funds to provide against 
accidents, dislocations caused by natural calamities, etc.</p>

<p class="quoteb">These deductions from the 'undiminished proceeds of labour' are 
an economic necessity and their magnitude is to be determined according to 
available means and forces, and partly by computation of probabilities, but they 
are in no way calculable by equity.</p>

<p class="quoteb">There remains the other part of the total product, intended to 
serve as means of consumption.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Before this is divided among the individuals, there has to be 
deduction from it:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>First</i>, <i>the general costs of administration not 
belonging to production</i>.</p>

<p class="quoteb">This part will, from the outset, be very considerably restricted 
in comparison to present-day society, and it diminishes in proportion as the new 
society develops.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Secondly</i>, <i>that which is intended for the common 
satisfaction of needs</i>, such as schools, health services, etc.</p>

<p class="quoteb">From the outset, this part will grow considerably in comparison 
with present-day society, and it grows in proportion as the new society 
develops.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><i>Thirdly</i>, <i>funds for those unable to work</i>, etc., in 
short, for what is included under so-called official poor relief today.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Only now do we come to the 'distribution' which the programme, 
under Lassallean influence, alone has in view in its narrow fashion, namely, to 
that part of the means of consumption which is divided among the individual 
producers of the cooperative society.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The 'undiminished proceeds of labour' have already unnoticeable 
become converted into the 'diminished' proceeds, although what the producer is 
deprived of in his capacity as a private individual benefits him directly or 
indirectly as a member of society " (K. Marx: <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i>; 
Progress Publishers, Moscow; 1978; p. 15)</p>

<p class="fst">That for which we search in vain amongst the writings of any of 
the official marxist economists is what first hits the eye in Marx's 
representation: as with capitalism, he sees the economy of the communist society 
as a closed, self-contained process, at the heart of which a law-governed 
circuit is taking place. The economic necessity to reproduce and extend the 
means of production consumed is the foundation on the basis of which the 
distribution of the total product is conceived. Furthermore, the idea would 
never have occurred to Marx that this necessary process of reproduction could be 
made the personal responsibility of State commissars, that is to say, could be 
purely subjectively decreed. On the contrary, <i>it is an objective process</i>, 
and it is a self-evident necessity that its unit measure of regulation and 
control must proceed out of production itself. Following upon that, when 
considering those general social outgoings which can be satisfied only socially 
and which will represent deductions from the "full proceeds of labour" - the 
maintenance of those incapable of work, etc., - with Marx there is no sign 
whatsoever of any conception which envisages that a mountain of statistics would 
be necessary for this to be done! On the contrary, these outgoings are obtained 
by a simple deduction from the individually consumed product. If one recalls the 
fact that he proposes as the measure for this distribution the individually 
contributed labour-time, the picture becomes complete. For all these reasons we 
believe ourselves to be fully justified in saying that the work which we have 
carried out is no more than the consistent application of Marx's own theoretical 
methods.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">2. From Money to Labour-Time Computation</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In the course of the various discussions we have held concerning 
the fundamental principles of communist production and distribution, there were 
two arguments which, in the main, were brought to bear in criticism of our work. 
The first related to the system of labour-time computation, and the second 
argument was that the foundations of communist society outlined in this study 
were "utopian". We now intend to show how history itself has refuted both these 
arguments.</p>

<p class="fst">The abolition of money and its replacement by average social 
labour-time - the so-called "labour certificates", is <i>a revolutionary act</i> 
and, providing that the working class can apply the necessary degree of social 
persuasion, could be brought into being within a few months of the establishment 
of proletarian power. It is no more than a question of social power, the social 
power of a class - <i>power which only the entire proletariat can adequately 
bring to bear</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">To achieve this, a party dictatorship is an absolutely 
inappropriate and inadequate instrument. A party dictatorship can be a product <u>
only</u> of a development towards State communism.</p>

<p class="fst">In the first phase of its existence, the new proletarian society 
will almost inevitably require vast quantities of money, which it will procure 
for itself in all likelihood by the same means as those employed by the 
capitalist States in central Europe in the immediate post-war period: that is to 
say, by means of the printing press. The result, of course, will be a strong 
monetary inflation, leading to soaring prices of all products. The question to 
be asked in this connection is not as to whether or not such consciously 
motivated inflation is desirable; if it were to be avoidable then the 
proletarian power would certainly do everything to prevent it. The phenomenon of 
devaluation of the currency is, however, an unavoidable consequence of each and 
every revolutionary movement which succeeds in any degree in overthrowing 
existing society. Just how the revolution then proceeds further - whether it 
leads to State communism or to the Association of Free and Equal Producers, 
whether a political party is successful in establishing its dictatorship or 
whether, on the other hand, the proletarian class succeeds in establishing its 
power through the Councils, - whichever of these occurs, inflation will be the 
inevitable by-product of social upheaval. In due course, however, a certain 
degree of regularisation of social relations sets in, and this in its turn makes 
stabilisation of the currency possible. The old unit of currency is discarded 
and a new one takes its place. Thus it was in Russia, where the Chervonetz was 
introduced as a new unit of currency; also Austria, which acquired its Schilling 
in this way, as did Belgium its Belgar and Germany its Goldmark. France and 
Italy took the same step, but with the currency retaining its old name.</p>

<p class="fst">Of all peoples, it has been the German people which have received 
the most enlightening instruction concerning the significance of a change in 
currency. Here, the simple decision was taken that, from a certain date, one 
billion Marks of the old currency would correspond with one new Goldmark. 
Economic life readily adapted itself to the new conditions and the new unit of 
currency was adopted with barely a disturbance to be seen anywhere on the social 
horizon.</p>

<p class="fst">Only an ungracious malcontent would have pointed out that in the 
process innumerable small property holders had been expropriated, because the 
devaluation of their holdings had so thoroughly ruined them that their creditors 
had been compelled to foreclose as the sole means of obtaining any restitution 
of the sums owed them!</p>

<p class="fst">Essentially the same phenomenon occurs with the introduction of 
the Average Social Hour of Labour as a unit of economic regulation and control. 
So soon as production is proceeding more or less smoothly, a situation of 
"stabilisation" is proclaimed, that is to say, from a certain date onwards all 
money will be declared worthless and only labour certificates will give 
entitlement to social product. It will be possible to exchange this "certificate 
money" only at the cooperative shops and warehouses. The sudden abolition of 
money will bring about a situation in which, equally suddenly, all products must 
have their appropriate ASRT (Average Social Reproduction Time) stamped upon 
them. It is, of course, simply not possible to do this on the spur of the moment 
and without further ado, and for the time being it is arrived at by sheer rule 
of thumb. This will inevitably mean that in one case it will be estimated too 
high, in another too low. So soon, however, as the system of labour-time 
computation will have been generally introduced, the real reproduction times 
will come to light soon enough.</p>

<p class="fst">In the same way, since the producers themselves will now have 
management and administration of production in their own hands, it will now also 
be their responsibility to complete the conversion from money values into 
labour-time units. The only tool they will require for this task will be a set 
of conversion tables or key indexes, a form of easy reference made so familiar 
to everybody during the war years.</p>

<p class="fst">A method of arriving at an approximate form of this conversion is 
to calculate the ASRT applicable to those countries which either produce a mass 
product, or else are so-called key industries - for instance, coal, iron and 
steel or potash. It will be possible to obtain from the works cost accounting 
department data revealing how many tonnes of product were produced in a given 
amount of time, and from this to derive the former intrinsic cost price. Leaving 
such purely capitalistic factors as interest on bank loans, etc., out of 
account, it is then possible to calculate how many labour-hours were expended in 
producing that quantity of product. From this same data it is then possible to 
calculate the money-value represented by an hour of iron production 
("iron-hour") or for an hour of potash production ("potash-hour"). This having 
been done, the average of all these industries can then be adopted as a 
temporary general average. In putting this forward we do not wish to suggest 
that this particular method of arriving at a conversion cipher is the sole 
definitive one, the exclusive use of which is axiomatic - on the contrary, there 
are many roads leading to the same goal. As we have already remarked, history 
has already proved the possibility of carrying through sudden changes in the 
unit of economic exchange employed. In the developed industrial nations, it has 
proved possible to complete "the largest and most difficult financial operation 
ever attempted anywhere" (the <i>New Statesman</i> commenting on the 
introduction of the Goldmark) without any serious difficulties.</p>

<p class="fst">Should our calculation, for instance, produce a result which 
shows that the relevant ASRT equivalent amounts to Marks 0.8 = 1 labour-hour, it 
will then be possible for each industrial establishment to calculate a temporary 
production time for its product. In all such industrial establishments, 
inventories would then be drawn up employing this standard scale, expressed in 
Marks. The depreciation of tools and machines is then estimated - values which, 
incidentally, are well-known in all industrial plants. This having been 
completed, everything is converted according to the figures shown in the index. 
In the case of a boot and shoe factory, for instance, the calculation could look 
something like this:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">Depreciated machinery etc., = Marks 1000 = 1250 Labour-Hours.</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">Leather etc., = Marks 49000 = 61250 Labour-Hours.</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">Labour-time = 62500</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center"><i>therefore total equates to</i>: 125000 = 40000 per shoe</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center"><i>Average Production Time then is</i>: 125000 <i>divided by</i> 
40000</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center"><i>equals</i> 3.125 per pr.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">3. Alleged Utopianism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The second argument deployed against us by our critics is that of 
an alleged "utopianism". However, this also is incorrect, since throughout the 
entire examination no imaginary constructions whatsoever have been dreamed up 
for the future. We have examined only the basic economic categories of communist 
economic life. Our sole aim has been to show that <i>the proletarian revolution 
must summon forth the power to implement in society the system of Average Social 
Reproduction Time (ASRT); should it fail in this</i>, <i>then the end outcome of 
the revolution will inevitably be State communism</i>. It is, however, unlikely 
that any such form of State communism will be introduced directly or openly 
announced, since this would tend to compromise it far too openly. A much more 
likely turn of events would be that these tendencies would develop out of some 
form of guild socialism, which the English writer G.D.H. Cole has described in 
his book <i>Self-Management in Industry</i>, and which has been taken up by 
Leichter in a more exact form. Everything here is disguised State communism. In 
particular, this work represents a last-ditch attempt by the bourgeoisie to 
forestall the establishment of that most fundamental but least understood of all 
the "Fundamental Principles of Communist Production and Distribution": the 
establishment of an exact relationship of the producer to the social product.</p>

<p class="fst">It has, on the contrary, been our experience that every work 
purporting to represent a principled view of communist production and 
distribution which has hitherto come to our attention and which claims to be 
based upon the historically valid realities is in fact based upon the purest 
utopia. Projects are drawn up showing how the various industries are to be 
organised, how the contradiction between producers and consumers is to be 
eliminated through the agencies of various commissions and committees, through 
which organs the power of the State is to be curbed, and so on. Wherever one or 
the other author of such a fantastic scheme finds he has fantasised himself into 
a corner with his intellectual somersaults, or wherever any difficulty arises in 
making his concocted speculations work out, for instance in respect to the 
integration of various industries ... the solution is soon to hand: a new 
commission or a special committee is "brought into being". This is especially 
the case with Cole's <i>Guild Socialism, the historical predecessor of which was 
so-called German trade-union socialism</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The organisational infrastructure of any system of production and 
distribution is functionally associated with the economic laws determining its 
movement. Any conception concerning such an infrastructure which does not 
reflect the economic categories inherent to its system is therefore no more than 
utopian speculation. Such utopianism merely serves to distract attention away 
from the real fundamental problems.</p>

<p class="fst">In our observations we have not concerned ourselves with this 
speculative field. Insofar as the organisational structure of economic life has 
been touched upon at all, this has been only to refer here and there to the 
organisation of industrial establishments and cooperatives. This has its 
justification in the fact that history has to a large extent already indicated 
what these forms are to be, thereby depriving them of any of the characteristics 
of an over-heated imagination. We have treated the question of the organisation 
of the peasants with the greatest reserve, precisely because the West European 
movement possesses very little experience in this field. We must await the 
verdict of history as to just how the peasants will organise themselves. As far 
as the farming establishments are concerned, we have contented ourselves by 
showing how capitalism itself has prepared the conditions for calculating 
Average Social Reproduction Time (ASRT). All we have done has been to examine 
some of the consequences arising from this.</p>

<p class="fst">Just how the industrial organisations will combine with one 
another, which organs they will call into being in order to ensure the smooth 
operation of production and distribution, just how these organs will be elected, 
how the cooperatives will be grouped - all these are problems the solutions for 
which will be determined by the special conditions prevailing in each sector of 
the economy and the specific ways in which they reflect the fundamental 
characteristics of production and distribution. It is precisely this, the 
functional operation of the production apparatus, which Cole elaborates in the 
greatest detail in his depiction of guild socialism, without anywhere touching 
upon the real problems as they arise from the fundamental economic laws of 
motion, and it is this which reduces his work to the status of worthless dross. 
For this reason we reject decisively any and all accusations of "utopianism". 
The method we have adopted in our exposition is precisely that of concentrating 
upon the fundamental questions, which are those concerned with the methods to be 
adopted for implementing the average social hour of labour and the reproduction 
time arising therefrom.</p>

<p class="fst">Should one equate trust in the strength of the proletariat to 
establish communism with utopia, then this can be no more than a subjective 
utopianism which the proletariat will need to eradicate through intensive 
propaganda.</p>

<p class="fst">The sole area in which the accusation of utopianism might seem to 
possess some semblance of justification is that relating to the system of 
control over the norms of economic life. But only a semblance. One might hold 
the opinion, for instance, that Leichter has allowed more scope for 
developmental possibilities, inasmuch as he has left open the question as to 
whether the system of accounting between separate industrial establishments 
should be carried out <i>individually between the establishments themselves</i> 
through the medium of labour certificates, or whether this should be done 
through simple double-entry book-keeping at the book-keeping centre, whilst we 
insist unconditionally upon the method of centralised double-entry recording. 
The essential point, however, is that we draw attention continually to the prime 
significance of the system of social book-keeping in general as a weapon of the 
economic power of the proletariat, whilst it simultaneously provides the 
solution to the problem of regulation and social control of economic life. The 
organisational structure of this system of book-keeping, its specific points of 
contact with society as a whole - these questions have naturally been left out 
of our account.</p>

<p class="fst">It is of course possible that, in its revolution, the proletariat 
will fail to generate the strength necessary to enable it to use this decisive 
weapon for promoting its class power. In the end, however, this is what it must 
come to, and indeed this is quite apart from the question of the social power of 
the proletariat, for the simple reason that a communist economy demands an exact 
computation of the quantity of unremunerated product which consumers are to 
receive. In other words, the data necessary for the computation of the Factor of 
Individual Consumption (FIC) must be ascertained; should this not be received, 
or only inadequately, then it becomes impossible to implement the category of 
Average Social Reproduction Time, whereupon the entire communist economy 
collapses. Then there remains no other solution than that of a <i>price policy</i>, 
and we will have turned full circle, to arrive once again at a system of rule 
over the masses. We will have sailed straight into the jaws of State communism. 
Thus it is not our imagination which considers the system of general social 
book-keeping to be a necessity for communism; on the contrary, it is the 
objective legality of the communist economic system which makes this 
unconditional demand.</p>

<p class="fst">If we were to make a brief summary of our observations, we would 
arrive at the following picture:</p>

<p class="fst">The foundations of this exposition are grounded in that which is 
empirically given, namely: that with the assumption of power in society by the 
proletariat, control over the means of production passes into the hands of the 
industrial organisations of the workers. The strength of communist 
consciousness, which in its turn is associated with a clear understanding as to 
the social uses to which those means of production are to be put, will determine 
whether or not the economic system in which that use is comprised will maintain 
itself. Should the proletariat fail to make its power effective, then the only 
road remaining open is that which leads to State communism, a system which can 
try out its various hopeless attempts to establish a planned system of 
production only on the backs of the workers. A second revolution, which finally 
succeeds in actually placing control over the means production into the hands of 
the producers themselves, then becomes necessary.</p>

<p class="fst">Should, however, the industrial organisations succeed in making 
their power effective, then they can order the economy in no other way than on 
the basis of Average Social Reproduction Time, with simultaneous abolition of 
money. It is, of course, also possible that syndicalist tendencies may be 
present, with such a degree of strength that the attempt of the workers to 
assume their own administrative control over the industrial establishments is 
accompanied by attempts to retain the role of money as the medium of exchange. 
Were this to occur, the result could be nothing other than the establishment of 
a form of guild socialism, which in its turn could only lead by another road to 
State communism. The decisive nodal point of a proletarian revolution, however, 
lies in the establishment of an exact relationship of the producers to the 
social product, and this is possible only by means of the universal introduction 
of the system of labour-time computation. <i>It is the highest demand that the 
proletariat can place before history</i>.. Simultaneously, however, it is also 
the most fundamental, and it is without doubt the decisive factor for the 
struggle for power. <i>It is an aspect of power which the proletariat alone can 
win</i>, <i>through its struggle</i>, and in that struggle it must never place 
its chief reliance upon the assistance of socialist or communist intellectuals.</p>

<p class="fst">The maintenance of the power of the industrial organisations is 
therefore based upon the assertion of independent administration and management, 
since this is the sole foundation upon which the system of labour-time 
accounting may be implemented. A veritable stream of literature from America, 
England and Germany supplies proof that the computation of average social 
production time is already being prepared within the bosom of capitalism. Under 
communism the calculation of (P + C) + L serves just as readily as now, under 
capitalism, a different unit of economic regulation does - in this respect also 
capitalist society bears the new communist mode of production in its womb. The 
settlement of accounts between the various industrial establishments, necessary 
to ensure the conditions for reproduction in each one of them, takes place 
through double-entry book-keeping maintained at the accounting centre ... just 
as now. This also represents yet another example of how capitalism is pregnant 
with the new communist order. The amalgamation of establishments is also a 
process which, already today, is being carried into effect. It must only be 
borne in mind that the industrial regroupings of the communist future will as 
likely as not be of a different kind, because they will pursue different aims. 
Those industrial establishments which we have designated as the GSU type, the 
so-called "public" establishments, also exist today, but as instruments of the 
capitalist State. These will be separated from the State and integrated into 
society according to communist principles. Here also we are dealing with the 
reconstruction and extension of that which already exists. But the State thereby 
loses its present hypocritical character and initially exists only as the 
apparatus of proletarian power pure and simple. Its task is to break the 
resistance of the bourgeoisie. ... But as far as the administration of the 
economy is concerned, it has no role whatsoever to fulfil, <i>whereby the 
preconditions for the "withering away" of the State are simultaneously given</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The separation of the public establishments from the State, their 
integration into the total organism of the economy, demands that the part of the 
total social product which is still destined for distribution according to norms 
of individual remuneration must be determined, for which purpose we have 
elaborated the Factor of Individual Consumption (FIC).</p>

<p class="fst">As regards the sphere of distribution, here also the organs of 
the future communist society are present in embryo within capitalism. To what 
extent present-day consumer cooperatives will prove to be viable as organs of 
the new communist economy is another question, since under communism 
distribution will be organised along different lines. One thing, however, is 
certain: a great deal of experience is even now being accumulated in the 
contemporary consumer cooperatives.</p>

<p class="fst">If we compare all this with State communism, the first thing to 
be observed is that, in its case, there is no possibility that money will pass 
out of use, because only those productive establishments will be made State 
property which have reached the required degree of "maturity". Hence a large 
part of production will still remain in the hands of private capital, thereby 
excluding the possibility of any other form of economic control than that of 
money. The <i>commodity market</i> remains, as does also <i>labour-power as a 
commodity</i>, one which must then realise its <i>price</i> on the market. This 
would mean that, in spite of all the fine words to the contrary, in reality <i>
the elimination of wage-labour would be impossible</i>. The ensuing programme of 
"nationalisation", which is then supposed to open up the road to communism, in 
fact inaugurates nothing but an endless vista of hopeless prospects. The right 
to shape the developing communist society is snatched out of the hands of the 
producers themselves and vested in those of State bureaucracy, which would soon 
bring the economy to a state of total stagnation. From the isolated 
vantage-point of their central bureaux, it would be the administrators who would 
decide what is produced, how long it would (more likely, <i>ought</i> to!) take 
to produce it, and with what level of wages labour would be remunerated.</p>

<p class="fst">In such a system it will also be necessary for democracy to play 
its part. It is solely by means of elected responsible bodies and councils that 
the interests of the masses can be guaranteed. This democracy, however, will be 
infringed and rendered null and void in sphere after sphere, because in essence 
it is incompatible with the type of centralised administration which will 
inevitably arise. The latter will unavoidably dissolve into the rule of many 
separate dictators, and the course of social life will be determined by 
autocratic forms of rule within the system of democracy. Thus here also we will 
see yet a further example of how democracy becomes a cloak concealing the actual 
imposition of the rule of a minority over millions of working people, exactly as 
under capitalism. At the very best the workers will have to content themselves 
with the highly valued "right of co-management", which represents yet another 
form of disguise concealing the real relations of power.</p>

<p class="fst">The rejection of all centralised forms of administration and 
management of production does not however imply that we have taken our stand 
exclusively upon a federalised structure. Wherever management and administration 
are in the hands of the masses themselves and are implemented through their 
industrial organisations and cooperatives, powerful syndicalist tendencies are 
without doubt present; but when viewed from the aspect of the system of general 
social book-keeping, economic life is seen to be <i>an indivisible whole</i>, 
from which strategic vantage-point the economy is not so much administered and 
managed as surveyed and planned as a unified whole. The fact that all the 
various changes wrought upon society in the course of the economic process by 
the application and simultaneous transformation of creative human energies come 
to be registered in the one recording organism forms the highest summation of 
all economic life. Whether one calls this federalist or centralist depends 
simply upon the vantage point from which one views the same phenomenon. It is 
simultaneously the one and the other, which means that, as far as the system of 
production as a whole is concerned, these concepts have lost their meaning. The 
mutual opposition of federalism and centralism has been subsumed within its 
higher unity; the productive organism has become an organic whole.</p>
