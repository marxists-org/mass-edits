Economic Processes</a></h1>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">1. The Labour-Hour as the Foundation of the Production Budget</a></h3>

<p class="fst">We have already made reference on several occasions to the 
Hilferdingian vision of a mode of concentration of the social productive 
apparatus which arises as a consequence of the rule of capital itself, that is 
to say, the general cartel. If we repeat this yet again, it is because we find 
in it the purest possible representation of social production as taking place 
through an organised unit, as this will take form according to the doctrines 
elaborated by the social-democratic and State-communist economists after the 
abolition of private property in means of production has been carried through. 
The relevant passage is as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The whole of capitalist production would then be consciously 
regulated by a single body which would determine the volume of production in all 
branches of industry. Price determination would become a purely nominal matter, 
involving only the distribution of the total product between the cartel magnates 
on one side and all the other members of society on the other. Price would then 
cease to become the outcome of factual relationships into which people have 
entered, and would become a mere accounting device by which things would be 
allocated among people. Money would have no role. In fact, it could well 
disappear completely, since the task to be accomplished would be the allocation 
of things, not the distribution of values. The illusion of the objective value 
of the commodity would disappear along with the anarchy of production, and money 
itself would cease to exist. The cartel would distribute the product. The 
material elements of production would be reproduced and used in new production. 
A part of the output would be distributed to the working class and the 
intellectuals, while the rest would be retained by the cartel to use as it saw 
fit. This would be a consciously regulated society, but in an antagonistic form. 
This antagonism, however, would express itself in the sphere of distribution, 
which itself would be consciously regulated and hence able to dispense with 
money. In its perfected form finance-capital is thus uprooted from the soil 
which nourished its beginnings. The circulation of money has become unnecessary, 
the ceaseless turnover of money has attained its goal in the regulated society, 
and the <i>perpetuum mobile</i> of circulation finds its ultimate resting 
place".<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This passage offers in a few bold outlines a genial 
representation of an economy forged into a single unit; production and 
reproduction are fused together within a single organisation. Existing today 
under the direction of a consortium of capitalist magnates - what stands in the 
way of the State assuming command over such a structure tomorrow? But Hilferding 
also declares that the economic categories of capitalist economy - value, price, 
money, the market - will be eliminated and made purposeless through the 
organisation of the economy on the foundations of such a system. At the same 
time, however, he has not a word to say as to what will take the place of these 
categories. Nevertheless, he does declare that, in the case of the "general 
cartel", the magnates of capital will rule through their control over finance 
capital, whilst under socialism the State commissioners will determine and 
administer the economic process "with all means of statistical science at their 
disposal".<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> Concerning the system of statistics itself, through which it is 
intended to replace value, price, money and the market, he says nothing. 
Although Hilferding disdains to declare himself clearly on these matters, one 
must nevertheless enrol him into the school of 'natural'<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> economists within 
which Neurath, Varga and others must also be included, and which would seek to 
control the process of production and distribution by means of the notorious 
system of production and consumption statistics which dispenses with the 
application of any economic unit of social regulation and control. We have 
already seen what characteristics such a brand of 'socialism' would possess when 
we considered the Faurean system of "universal happiness".</p>

<p class="fst">It is unnecessary to investigate further the impossibility of 
such an economy; we will make only the additional point that even the "general 
cartel" described by Hilferding cannot manage without a computed unit of 
economic regulation and control. If Hilferding has clearly demonstrated how 
money becomes superfluous in a consciously operated economy, then it is also 
clear that only the labour-hour can function as its replacement. Communist 
economy must rest upon the foundation of labour-time computation, as any other 
unit measure of accounting control is out of the question. Thus it becomes 
necessary for society to compute "how much labour each useful article requires 
for its production" (F. Engels, Anti-Dühring). As our criticism of Kautsky has 
demonstrated, this is quite impossible to carry out from the offices of a 
central economic authority. The procedures associated with labour-time 
computation must therefore be effected through the agencies of the locally based 
organisations themselves at the place of work - at the factories, works, 
offices, etc. A system of social accounting based upon the computation of 
average social labour-time, uncompromisingly implemented, and applied to both 
tangible products and services, provides the firm foundation upon which the 
entire economic life of the producer-consumers must be structured, directed and 
administered.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The strict application of the category of average social 
production time which, as here expounded, moves and develops wholly on the 
foundations of marxist economic theory, leads to an organic union of economic 
life in its entirety. The economic organism emerges as a system in which all the 
antagonistic motivations of capitalist commodity production have been 
eliminated, that is to say, as a system designed solely to promote the struggle 
of humanity as a whole against the forces of the Darwinian jungle. Within this 
system the stream of products move wholly in accordance with the laws of motion 
established by labour equivalents: " a quantity of labour in another form is 
exchanged for an equal quantity of labour in another form". At the end of the 
chain of production the finished product available for disposal in the hands of 
the consumers has required for its production the total production time applied, 
neither more nor less, from the very beginning to the very end.</p>

<p class="fst">The book-keeping procedures necessary for the regulation of the 
product-flow do not as yet extend further than the sphere of the individual 
industrial establishment or the production sector to which it belongs, and 
relate in the main only to input and output, that is to say, to the product-flow 
through the factory. Aside from this, however, we would observe that this has 
nothing whatever to do with the works or factory-based method of cost 
accounting, which in recent years has become a science in itself. For this a 
specialised knowledge of the different specific production processes in the 
separate industrial establishments is necessary; this is designed to supply the 
data needed for an entry recording system of the debit and credit type. In a 
system, however, in which production times have been ascertained by competent 
technical staff, there remain only the movements of debit and credit for the 
office workers to record.</p>

<p class="fst">The method according to which the settlement of charges between 
the various productive establishments takes place has to a large extent already 
been pre-developed under capitalism, in the form of simple transfer-accounting 
effected through the banks or clearing houses. In respect of methods of 
settlement applicable to a communist economy, Leichter declares:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"All material requirements of production, all half-finished 
materials, all raw materials, all auxiliary materials supplied by other 
productive establishments for the use of the one which works them up, are 
accounted a charge to the latter. The question as to whether this is discharged 
through spot-settlement in the form of labour-hours expressed in terms of Labour 
Certificates, or if ledger-controlled charges are resorted to i.e., a method of 
ledger-control charging which dispenses with 'spot-payment', will best be 
resolved through practice itself".<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Practice will indeed have a decisive word to say in this matter. 
In principle, however, it must be said that a mode of payment by 
"spot-settlement" effected through labour certificates would represent a 
fundamentally wrong solution. Firstly, because it fulfils no essential purpose, 
and secondly because an on-the-spot or 'cash' method of settlement would 
introduce serious hindrances onto the system of social regulation and control 
over production.</p>

<p class="fst">The intervention of labour certificates into relations between 
the productive establishments is wholly superfluous. In every case in which a 
factory delivers its end product, it has handed on (p + c) + L labour-hours to 
the chain of partially completed use-values. These must then be taken up 
immediately in like amount by the receiving establishment in the form of new p, 
c and L, in order that the next labour or production process may commence. Thus 
the regulation of production in accordance with this system requires no more 
than a registration of the stream of products, as this flows through the total 
social production system. The sole role of labour certificates is to function as 
the means to enable <i>individual consumption</i> in all its variety to be 
regulated according to the measure of labour-time. A part of the total 'yield' 
of any individual unit of labour is, in the course of daily economic life, 
already consumed through the processes of socialised distribution, i.e., 
reproduction, whilst only a certain proportion of that total can make its way in 
the form of labour certificates into the hands of individual consumers and be 
expended in accordance with the production times stamped upon the separate 
consumption articles. We have already observed that the mass of labour 
certificates issued becomes continually smaller as the process of socialisation 
of distribution proceeds, finally to reach a figure of nil.</p>

<p class="fst">The determination of the Factor of Individual Consumption is 
social book-keeping in the truest sense of the word. On the one hand there 
appears on the credit side of society the amount representing those labour-hours 
directly expended by the productive establishments: L. This figure can be found 
immediately in the system of general social book-keeping under the heading of 
the settlement account. On the other hand there appears here as a debit the 
quantities of Pu, Cu and Lu. <i>Thus society establishes a system of general 
social book-keeping out of the totality of social production and consumption</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">It is by these means that the following passage from Marx becomes 
reality:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Book-keeping, however, as the supervisor and the ideal 
recapitulation of the process, becomes ever more necessary the more the process 
takes place on a social scale and loses its purely individual character; it is 
thus more necessary in capitalist production than in the fragmented production 
of handicraftsmen and peasants, more necessary in communal production than in 
capitalist".<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This is book-keeping pure and simple, and nothing more than 
book-keeping. Although it is the central point at which all the various strands 
of the economic processes come together, it nevertheless wields no power over 
the economic system. The system of general social book-keeping is itself an 
economic organisation of the GSU or "public" type, which has as one of its 
functions the responsibility for regulating individual consumption through the 
calculation of the remuneration factor, or the factor of individual consumption 
(FIC). It imparts neither any right of management or administration of, nor any 
power of disposal over, the economic system as such. These functions lie solely 
in the hands of the producer-consumers. The indigenous Workers' Council situated 
at the establishment responsible for general social book-keeping has authority 
in one such establishment only, and that is its own. This is so, however, not 
because of this or that decree, nor even because it is in any way a reflection 
of any kind of good will on the part of the workers who work in the Exchange and 
Settlement Office, but is determined objectively by the economic process itself. 
It is so because, amongst other things, each economic establishment or 
production sector is responsible for its own reproduction, and because each 
individual worker has, through that individual's contribution of labour, 
simultaneously determined his or her relationship to the social product.</p>

indeed, of virtually all other members of the professional intelligentsia in the 
leadership of the Social Democratic Party of Germany - for indirect empirical 
methods of economic control embodied in a vast bureaucratic State machine and 
characterised fundamentally by externally imposed forms through which the 
domination of the apparatus of production and distribution over the producers is 
realised, was itself a symptom of the petit-bourgeois, deterministic world 
outlook characteristic of that class - and one, furthermore, which declared its 
close kinship to the bourgeoisie proper. The longing for the perfect machine of 
social and economic administration which filled the dreams of these 
mechanical-determinist founding fathers of State socialism was, of course, later 
realised in Russia by Lenin and the Bolsheviks.</p>
