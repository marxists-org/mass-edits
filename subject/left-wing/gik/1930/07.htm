<h4>CHAPTER 7</h4>
<h1><a name="h0">The Communist Mode of Distribution</a></h1>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">1. The Relationship of the Producer to the Product</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Following upon all that has been outlined hitherto, we can now 
move on to deal relatively swiftly with the question of distribution. The 
fundamental aspect here, of course, is and remains that of securing an exact 
relationship of the producer to the product. We have seen that all economists 
who have concerned themselves with the problem of the distribution of goods and 
services in a communist society have not conceived this relationship as being 
determined in the sphere of production itself, but have made it the nodal point 
of competitive or antagonistic political or economic relations amongst the 
consumers. This however means nothing other than that the struggle for power in 
the State, for a dominant position within the relationship of the producer to 
the product, is still burning at the heart of society and is continuing to make 
its corrosive influence felt. Wherever, on the other hand, the producer 
determines a relationship to the social product directly through labour, a price 
policy is rendered both completely impossible and unnecessary. The conditions 
for the "withering away" of the State are then for the first time given, and we 
can say:<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">"The society which organises production anew on the basis of free 
and equal association of the producers will put the whole state machinery where 
it will then belong - into the museum of antiquities, next to the spinning wheel 
and the bronze axe."<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">"The government of persons is replaced by the administration of 
things and the direction of the processes of production".<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As soon as the decisive relationship between producer and product 
has been firmly anchored, it only remains to carry through the integration of 
industrial establishments in both horizontal and vertical directions for the 
production process to be structured in the most rational way possible. This 
integration is a process which has its starting point in the producers 
themselves. Today, under capitalism, it is the profit motive which leads to 
amalgamations of economic concerns - trusts, price rings, cartels and similar 
organisations. Under communism, when the profit motive has been excluded, it is 
a question of linking the industrial establishments with one another in such a 
way that a smooth flow of products from establishment to establishment or, 
alternatively, from a productive establishment to a distributive cooperative, 
can fully unfold. The exact computation of all those values, expressed in 
labour-hours, which flow into and out of the factories and other economic 
establishments, ensures the smooth operation of the whole distributive process, 
responsibility for which can then rest with the producers without any 
intervention by a State authority. The distribution of the greater part of the 
total social product, that is to say that represented by means of production, 
which flows ever anew to each productive establishment or factory, also fall 
unreservedly within the sphere of responsibility of the producers themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">If we now focus our attention upon the question of the 
distribution of those products destined for individual consumption, emphasis 
must be placed upon the mutual interdependence of production and distribution. 
Just as that mode of administration of the economy which proceeds from a 
directing centre requires the method of allocation according to subjective norms 
reflecting administrative judgement, in just the same way the association of 
free and equal <i>producers</i> makes necessarily a corresponding association of 
free and equal <i>consumers</i>. Thus distribution also takes place 
collectively, through cooperation of every kind. We have already demonstrated 
how, in this respect at least, Russia provided a glowing example of how 
consumers organised themselves in a short space of time in order to be able to 
distribute the product independently, that is to say independently of the State. 
However we have also demonstrated that this Russian independence was only a 
farce, because the relationship of producer to product had already been 
determined previously in the higher spheres of the administration. Nevertheless, 
in itself the form of distribution thus achieved remains a positive achievement.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not the task to provide here a description of the process 
leading to the amalgamation of the distributive cooperatives. This will most 
certainly vary according to local conditions and the type of product to be 
distributed. Nevertheless, it is necessary that we make clear the general 
principles of distribution, as these are given, determined by and developed from 
the character of the social system of economic regulation and accounting 
control. This necessity arises out of the fact that it is our fundamental 
responsibility to demonstrate of what crucial significance it is that <i>the 
system of distribution should not in any way infringe the principle of an exact 
relationship of the producer to the product</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">In the course of our examination of the system of economic 
regulation and accounting control based upon average social labour-time, we have 
seen that this relationship develops, grows in strength and implants itself 
socially irrespective of and unhindered by the general charges imposed by 
society, and so ensures that "the full yield of their labour-power" accrues to 
the workers as a whole. Expressed in another way, this means that the costs 
entailed in distribution must be adopted as a part of the general GSU budget. <i>
The distribution of goods is a general social function</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus the costs of distribution cannot be borne by each separate 
distributive cooperative alone, if for no other reason than that, as its end 
result, this would infringe the principle of an exact relationship of the 
producer to the product. Were this to be introduced, the centralised 
administration of the distribution organisation would then be compelled to apply 
a "price policy" in order to cover these costs, and this would then lead to the 
principle of distribution according to arbitrary administrative decision being 
smuggled in by the back door. If we consider a distribution organisation from 
its aspect as a consumer of p and L, then it becomes clear that it has to be 
classified as <u><b>an economic organisation of the GSU type</b></u>. The 
product or service which is the result of its activities is precisely the 
distribution of products.</p>

<p class="fst">From this characterisation it can be seen clearly that these 
organisations are bound by the same rules as apply to all GSU establishments. 
Like all others, they also prepare a budget in which is shown how much (p + c) + 
L = service (i.e. is equivalent to x product-hours available for distribution). 
Within the framework of this schematic the distribution organisation has 
complete freedom of movement and is "master in its own house", whilst at the 
same time we have ensured that, in the sphere of distribution also, the 
principle of an exact relationship of producer to product has not been 
infringed.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">2. The Market</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Although we have indicated the basis upon which distribution 
should be founded and the structure it should take, one important problem 
nevertheless remains for solution; this relates to the question as to whether or 
not the necessary total quantity required by consumers is available for 
distribution; in other words, production must correspond with and reflect the 
needs of the population. For this to apply, we must in the first place have 
knowledge of the scope and quality of those needs; then the output of the 
productive establishments - and, where appropriate, the GSU ones as well - can 
be regulated to correspond harmoniously with them. This is to some extent a 
crucial question, since our opponents choose this as the precise point at which 
to direct their criticism. They declare bluntly that communism, which seeks to 
replace a value-engendered economy with an economy of use, disposes of no means 
by which to ascertain what the needs of society are. Capitalism, of course, 
solves this problem spontaneously. Wherever and as soon as a greater demand for 
certain products arises, this makes itself felt in the market in the form of an 
increase in the prices of the relevant commodities. Since the resulting higher 
profits then attract investors, capital then tends to flow towards that sector 
of production in which those articles are produced, so that the increased demand 
is satisfied relatively rapidly. A reduction in demand has, of course, the 
opposite effect upon production. In this way the <i>market mechanism</i> fulfils 
the function of a regulator of demand.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is a well known fact that this market mechanism is not the 
innocent tool that it appears at first sight. For it is precisely this mechanism 
which forms one of the nodal points through which the colossal production crises 
of capitalism express themselves, crises which deliver over thousands to a life 
of hunger and want and which also form the source of imperialist rivalries which 
drive millions to their death on the battlefield.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> Nevertheless, the market 
is, and has been in the past to even a greater degree, an indicator of demand 
under capitalism. Communism, on the other hand, knows nothing of markets, also 
price formation and supply and demand are unknown to it, so that it has to make 
do without these well-known mechanisms. It was in this sphere that the notorious 
"devourer of communists", L. Mises earned his laurels, to the accompaniment of 
thunderous applause on the part of his worthy peers. With the following words he 
proved the economic impossibility of communism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Where there are no free market relations, there is no formation 
of prices, and without formation of prices there can be no 'economic 
regulation'"<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">For Block also this was a problem the solution of which remained 
veiled in deepest obscurity:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Wherever individual exchange is eliminated, production becomes a 
matter of social necessity, and for that reason the products themselves become 
objects of social necessity. As for the methods by means of which that which is 
deemed socially necessary are to be arrived at and determined, Marx did not 
concern himself further. So long as it is not possible to demonstrate by what 
alternative the market mechanism is to be replaced, it is not possible to 
conceive in practice of a non-monetary system of regulation in a socialised 
economy, that is to say a rational form of socialism."<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus Block has no solution to offer. The solutions proposed by 
Neurath and others, he considers to be impracticable - a view in which we can 
share. All these solutions to the problem point in the same direction and are 
turned out according to the same Hilferdingian recipe "with all the means made 
available by organised application of statistics", and thus one which yet again 
makes necessary a centralised right of disposal over the social product.</p>

<p class="fst">Before we can look more closely into this question, we must first 
come to grips with the two distinct characteristics possessed by the capitalist 
and the communist modes of distribution respectively. In the above passage we 
have conceded that, under capitalism, the market functions as an indicator of 
demand. A closer examination of this matter, however, shows that this is true 
only to a limited degree. Under capitalism, labour-power is a commodity, with a 
more or less definite market price. This price revolves around the subsistence 
minimum needed by the worker. Out of the price yielded by the sale of a 
particular unit of labour-power, the wage, that labour-power is reproduced, and 
therewith the matter has an end. The social product may grow to an immense 
degree, but the worker still receives only a subsistence minimum. Of course, 
needs may become greater; they are, of course, stimulated by the greater mass of 
products available, a great many of which are in any case unattainable. 
Capitalism may refer in as generous terms as it likes to its precious market 
mechanism, which is supposed to function as an indicator of demand; <i>in 
reality it does not take these needs into account</i>, or at least knows them to 
a far lesser degree even than do those who would seek to replace the market by a 
statistical apparatus. For capitalism, it is not even necessary for the market 
to be known precisely, because in the final instance, and particularly as far as 
the proletariat is concerned, it produces not for need but for profit. In other 
words, as far as the proletariat is concerned, the famous market mechanism moves 
only within the narrow limits prescribed by the <i>subsistence minimum</i>, 
whilst any knowledge of demand in the communist sense of the word is quite 
unthinkable. The bourgeois economists know this well. Block says in this 
connection:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The process of price formation sees to it <i>that only the most 
urgent needs are satisfied</i>, <i>that is to say those needs for the 
satisfaction of which a maximum degree of purchasing power can be demanded</i>".<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Communist society, on the other hand, knows only of an equal 
scale of distribution of the social product amongst all consumers. With this 
system, labour-power has ceased to be a commodity which bears a price. With the 
growth of the social product the share accruing to each individual automatically 
becomes greater if in each single product the principle of a direct relationship 
of a producer to a product is given full expression - a situation in which 
prices cease to have any meaning. Thus we now see that the establishment of the 
hour of average social labour as the unit of economic regulation and control has 
as its necessary twofold purpose i) to place the reproduction of the impersonal 
part of the productive apparatus on sure foundations; and ii) to order the 
distribution of consumption goods.</p>

<p class="fst">Having made these observations concerning the distinction to be 
made between capitalist and communist modes of distribution of the social 
product, it should be clear that a market where prices are formed and where 
demand is made effective is, under communism, completely absent. Thus it will be 
necessary for a communist society to bring into being at the outset those organs 
through which the wishes and demands of consumers will be given expression. That 
which capitalism has no precise knowledge, namely, the needs of the workers, 
becomes under communism the <i>entire determinative foundation of production</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus where Block, for instance, poses the question as to what is 
to replace the market mechanism, we reply that it <i>will not be replaced at all</i>! 
A communist society establishes, in the form of the distributive organisations, 
those organs which give <i>collective</i> expression to <i>individual</i> needs 
and wishes.</p>

<p class="fst">The links and forms of cooperation which it will be necessary to 
establish between the various distributive organisations form a complex of 
problems which can only be solved in the crucible of developing communist social 
life itself. The initiative undertaken by producers and consumers themselves 
here find their full expression. Just as the liberation of the workers can only 
result from the struggles of the workers themselves, in the same way does this, 
in the context of a communist society, acquire the meaning that the entire 
organisational nexus between production and the distributive organisations, 
through which actual demand is given expression, can likewise only be the work 
of the producer-consumers themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">Those economists who represent the view that the market mechanism 
is an indispensable feature of any society continually make reference to the 
alleged fact that, if the market is absent, demand is impossible to ascertain. 
By this kind of demand, however, is meant those subjective vagaries of fashion 
which can change so suddenly because the capriciousness of popular taste is so 
often revealed in the capriciousness of their real or imagined needs. In this 
way a new demand can quite suddenly push itself into the foreground or another 
equally suddenly disappear. The leaps and contortions so often apparent in the 
sphere of "fashion" provide instructive examples of this. It is, allegedly, the 
market which provides the productive apparatus with the means for adapting 
itself to all these twists and turns, and in this way is said to satisfy every 
kind of whim expressed through demand.</p>

<p class="fst">The above-mentioned critics have a strong argument against 
communism when they make the point that it would doom the spontaneously creative 
element in social life to a rigid immobility and ultimate death. And they have a 
degree of justice on their side when they polemicise against the official brand 
of "communism", i.e., that which would seek to measure demand "with all the 
means at the disposal of higher organised consumer statistics" and which is 
characterised by centralised administrative control over production and 
distribution. The fact is, of course, that the flow of creative energy in social 
life is not amenable to statistical control, and its richness resides precisely 
in its variety and many-sidedness. The aim of encompassing social needs in 
statistical form is completely meaningless. Statistics are capable of 
ascertaining only the most general social tendencies, and they are totally 
incapable of comprising the myriad detail which is embodied in the particular 
and the special. It is for this reason that we can say that a mode of production 
controlled by consumer statistics could not possibly be production for need, but 
only a production in accordance with certain norms which the central 
administration would lay down in accordance with the directives of those old 
acquaintances of ours, the subsistence or "minimum standard of living" 
sociologists. The objections of our critics are scattered like so much straw in 
the wind as soon as production and distribution lie in the hands of the 
producers themselves. The organisation of the consumers in their consumer 
cooperatives and in direct communication with the productive organisations is a 
relationship which permits complete mobility. This mobility would comprise and 
comprehend directly the changed and changing needs of individuals, who would 
transmit these needs directly to the productive apparatus. Such a direct 
connection would be made possible only because no State apparatus preoccupied 
with "price policy" would be present to interpose itself between producer and 
consumer. To each product would be given its own specific reproduction time, and 
this it then carries with it on its journey through the social economy. In 
whatever form a product is to be created, the appropriate demand is communicated 
by the distributive organisations to the productive establishments. This is the 
entire secret as to how production organised on the basis of the communist mode 
of production and distribution renders the market mechanism superfluous.</p>

<p class="fst">If now we seek to give expression to the whole mode of 
distribution as a totality, <i>we see that the total social product (TSP) in 
fact distributes itself quite spontaneously amongst the various groups of 
consumers</i>. The operation of the production process itself determines how and 
in what precise proportions it makes the transition from the sphere of 
production to that of distribution, and so makes itself available to society at 
large. Leaving the category "accumulation" temporarily out of account, each 
group of consumption goods takes from the consumer such quantities as (P + C) + 
L as represents its proportion of the total social product, and in the same 
measure as that according to which it contributed to the creation of that total 
social product in the first place. This can be implemented without any 
difficulty, because on each product the appropriate production time is clearly 
indicated.</p>

<p class="fst">In the production process each productive establishment 
calculates its consumption needs by means of the production formula (p + c) + L. 
The total production process is made up of the total of all productive 
establishments, which we express in the formula (P + C) + L = TSP. The same 
system which is valid for each separate productive establishment is also valid 
for the total system of production. If it is the case that for each productive 
establishment and for each separate productive set of conditions, the average 
social production time has been computed, then in the same way the sum total of 
all production times must be represented in the total product (TSP). The 
following principles then apply to the distribution of TSP: each individual 
economic establishment, whether it be of the productive type or of the GSU type, 
at first withdraws from TSP as much p as has been calculated for it in its 
production budget. As soon as this has been carried out for all economic 
establishments, they have replaced once again their consumption of p, and 
therewith p has been distributed in a fully correct proportion.</p>

<p class="fst">Proceeding further, each economic establishment withdraws from 
TSP as much c as has been computed for it in its production budget. As soon as 
this has been carried out for all industrial or other establishments, then c 
also has been distributed in a correct proportion and has been returned to the 
total system of production. Following immediately upon this, each separate 
industrial or other establishment has the responsibility to submit to the 
workers directives concerning the amount of social product available for 
consumption through the medium of labour certificates, in exactly the quantity 
as has been computed for it in the production budget under L. The total sum of 
these directives is L.(x), x representing the total sum of said establishments. 
The consumers can then withdraw from TSP such a mass of goods as corresponds 
with the total of labour-hours contributed.</p>

<p class="fst">In this way TSP has been fully taken up by society, whilst at the 
same time the relationship of the various consumer groups to one another and the 
measure of distribution adopted <i>have been fully determined by the production 
process itself</i>. In no way is control dependant upon subjective norms decreed 
by official and authoritative bodies, the precondition for whose power of diktat 
resides in a centralised right of disposal over production and distribution.</p>

the State are then for the first time given, and we can say:" (Quotation from F.

first principle of communist production: "The establishment of a clear and open 
relationship of the producer to the product". So long as this principle is 
adhered to and remains the foundation of all social life, the imposition of an 
alienative relationship based on inequality and class privilege by an incipient

<p class="endnote"><a name="n4" href="#fn4">[4]</a> <u>Paragraph ending:</u> "In this way the market mechanism 
fulfils the function of a regulator of demand". The most basic impediment to the 
smooth operation of this most fundamental plank in the theoretical heritage of 
classical bourgeois political economy is, of course, the unavoidable tendency 
under capitalism for simple "demand" to be restricted in practice to effective 
demand. The workers - or for that matter, any other section of the population - 
can "demand" the commodities they need, whether these are staple life 
necessities, as with the working class, or capital goods and raw materials, as 
with the capitalists, until they are hoarse from shouting - if the money 
commodity needed to purchase them is not forthcoming, or at least in sufficient 
quantity, then a non-effective demand is as good as a non-existent or a reduced 
demand. Whilst the above is a depiction of what are essentially contradictions 
at the surface or conjunctural level of economic movement, the level of the 
market - and none the less real for that! - it should not be assumed from this 
that the marxist theory of accumulation and crisis in any way reflects the 
acceptance of crude "underconsumptionist" theories as a fundamental cause of 
crisis. On the contrary, marxist economic theory sees that cause as residing in 
either one of the following two or - as is almost always the case - in a 
combination of the two: a) a fall in the per-circuit rate of surplus value below 
the level at which it can effectively maintain the rate of profit against a 
simultaneous tendency for the organic composition of capital to rise; or: b) 
under conditions in which, likewise, organic composition is rising, a fall in 
the rate of absolute capital turnover to a point at or below which it fails to 
compensate for an inadequate per-circuit rate of surplus value. In other words, 
marxism sees the cause of crisis residing, not is the sphere of distribution but 
in that of production, where surplus value and profit have their generative 
source. For, instance, a fall in the rate of employment of labour will usually 
be preceded by a fall in the rate of employment of capital, the latter arising 
on account of difficulties experienced by capital in finding profitable 
conditions of production, and hence resulting in the throwing of "its" workers 
out onto the streets. It is this which is the primal cause of a fall in 
"effective demand", and not, as the facile prescriptions of the bourgeois 
"economic experts" maintain, the opposite, a fall in effective demand which then 
brings about a fall in production and hence in the current rate of employment of 
labour. A fall in "effective demand" is thus an effect, not a cause, of crisis.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n5" href="#fn5">[5]</a> "... and which also form the source of imperialist rivalries 
which drive millions to their death on the battlefield." Inter-capitalist 
rivalry, culminating in war, is of course also a "surface conjunctural 
tendency", and it is therefore perfectly valid to point out its relationship to 
the market. Wars are fought, however, not in order to raise "effective demand", 
and particularly not on the part of the working class. On the contrary, their 
"positive" aim is to win control of markets and "spheres of influence", i.e., to 
promote advantageous conditions for the investment and accumulation of capital. 
Their "negative" purpose, on the other hand, is to eliminate en masse those 
"units of human labour-power" - i.e., members of the working class - who have 
been rendered surplus to social capital's requirements through the inexorable 
advance of productive technology and the rising productivity of labour and who 
would otherwise go towards forming a large, expensive and possibly permanent 
"reserve army of labour"; as well as to destroy large masses of the associated 
technologically outdated means of production.</p>
