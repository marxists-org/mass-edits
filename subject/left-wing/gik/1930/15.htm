<h4>CHAPTER 15</h4>
<h1><a name="h0">The Peasants and the Revolution</a></h1>

<p class="fst">The course of development sketched out above has prevented the 
formation of a numerous agrarian proletariat. Even if this proletariat is much 
larger numerically than the number of peasant proprietors, it is nevertheless a 
very long way from reaching the relatively overwhelming proportional size 
represented by the masses of the industrial proletariat in relation to the 
bourgeoisie. A further factor to be noted is that class contradictions in the 
countryside do not assume so sharp or prominent a form, precisely because the 
small and middle peasant works alongside the other members of his family. 
Whereas in the cities, forms of ownership have led to pure parasitism, in the 
case of small and middle peasant enterprise this is not the case. For all these 
reasons the prospect of a proletarian revolution in the countryside is beset by 
much more difficult problems than its counterpart in the cities. Nevertheless, a 
closer examination reveals that the perspective's are by no means as hopeless as 
they appear at first glance. It goes without saying that there is in the 
countryside a relatively large number of peasant owners, but these latter know 
perfectly well at bottom their status is not much more than that of agents of 
bank capital, whilst at the same time the burden of economic insecurity weighs 
very heavily upon them. On the other hand, it is undoubtedly true that the 
peasant proprietor will never be in the vanguard of the struggle for communism. 
The economic position which he holds, however, compels him to link up with those 
social groups which at any given moment are dominant in the economy. The 
precondition for this is, nevertheless, that he is not driven from his house and 
farmyard, and that he is not excluded from management and administration of his 
productive resources. The proletarian revolution can have no truck with rent or 
mortgage debts, since only the Average Social Reproduction Time (ASRT) of the 
products forms the basis of all economic relations, and to this extent at least 
the peasant question takes on a form which, as far as the Association of Free 
and Equal Producers is concerned, is perhaps not as anomalous as in the 
relationship of the so-called "mature" industrial establishments towards 
communism.</p>

<p class="fst">The fact that the peasant has become a commodity or market 
producer is a matter of the very greatest significance for the revolution, and 
the so-called "fear of the peasant" can to a great extent be attributed to the 
fact that the real position of the contemporary peasant has to a large extent 
been misunderstood. For instance, reference is often made to the fact that the 
proletariat is dependent upon the peasantry for its food supplies, and that, for 
that reason, it would be unwise to adopt too openly pronounced socio-economic 
measures against them.</p>

<p class="fst">These fears, however, rest upon an estimation of the situation in 
the agrarian economy which derives from a period now past. The question tends to 
be understood in such a way as to suggest that the peasant is still the peasant 
of earlier times and not the developed market producer that he is today, who 
brings to market not only the surplus output yielded by his isolated domestic 
economy but the whole of his product. In present day society the proletariat is 
no longer dependent upon the peasantry; indeed, the opposite is more the case. 
Should the peasants fail to deliver their product to the proletariat, then they 
themselves become as much a victim of hunger as the proletariat does, however 
paradoxical this may seem. In the final outcome, the peasant is compelled to 
sell his product, for the simple reason that <i>he only produces that which he 
himself does not require and is compelled to consume that which he does not 
produce</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">One often hears the observation that the peasant would rather 
feed his product to the animals than sell it under conditions of compulsion. 
This also represents a misunderstanding, one which rests upon an obsolete view 
reflecting the old isolated domestic peasant economy. Apart from auxiliary 
adjuncts, the livestock peasant possesses nothing but livestock, whilst the 
arable farmer possesses grain but no livestock, the chicken farmer several 
hundreds of chickens but no livestock, the vegetable farmer only a definite 
number of varieties of vegetables, and so on. <i>They are all specialists</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">In addition to the above, one often hears the fear expressed 
that, in the event of a revolutionary social transformation, the peasant would 
refuse to continue to cultivate his land; in other words, that he would attempt 
to return to the isolated domestic economy of earlier historical periods. But 
this path also is one that is closed to him. Even the most ingenious peasant is 
hardly so resourceful as to be able to move backwards 100 years and produce with 
his own labour everything that he needs. He cannot do this because he disposes 
neither of the necessary skills nor the tools required. Once the process of the 
socialisation of labour has been completed, no one section of the community is 
able to withdraw from it. Any movement backwards becomes impossible. From 
whatever direction one may view the matter, <i>the peasantry forms a part of the 
crew manning the ship of society</i>, <i>and will sink or sail with it</i>.</p>
