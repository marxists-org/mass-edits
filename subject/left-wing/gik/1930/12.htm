<h4>CHAPTER 12</h4>
<h1><a name="h0">Socially Necessary Labour and Average Social Reproduction Time</a></h1>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">1. Essential Categories</a></h3>

<p class="fst">If we subject the category SNL (Socially Necessary Labour) to 
closer examination, we observe that two totally disparate elements have here 
been thrown together under the one heading. On the one hand it contains the 
simple determinative element that a specific form of labour satisfies a specific 
social need and is therefore socially necessary; on the other hand, insofar as a 
temporal aspect (labour-<i>time</i>) is involved, it gives expression to an 
element of economic regulation. Thus Kautsky, for instance, speaks of the 
socially necessary labour which is contained in a particular product "from its 
first origins through to its final completion, including transport and other 
auxiliary operations", and which cannot be estimated "even with the help of the 
most colossal and perfected statistical apparatus". Even though, according to 
Kautsky, it is theoretically possible to calculate this category in full, in 
practice this is unrealisable and therefore, as far as any purposes of budgetary 
control are concerned, it must, according to Kautsky, be rejected as practically 
useless.</p>

<p class="fst">Turning now to Varga, it is his intention that Socially Necessary 
Labour (SNL) should also have a defined regulatory and accounting role to play. 
It is even his wish that this should find expression in the name given to the 
term, and for this reason he speaks of an "inherent social cost price":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"By this we understand <i>the inherent cost price plus an additional increment for the 
maintenance of the non-labouring sections of the population</i>, <i>plus a 
further increment for the realisation of social accumulation</i>. This is the 
solution in principle". (E. Varga: <i>Die wirtschaftspolitischen Probleme der 
proletarischen Diktatur</i>, p. 147). (Varga's emphasis).</p>

<p class="fst">This "solution in principle" does indeed appear an attractive 
proposition. Adopting Varga's "formula for inherent costs" into the overall 
theoretical scheme, one arrives at the following:</p>

<p class="fst">(P + C) + L + GSU + ACC</p>

<p class="fst">Unfortunately, however, Varga does not provide any information as 
to how the additional increments for the GSU establishments and accumulation are 
to be determined or in what magnitude they are to be brought into relation with 
the rest of the schematic. For that reason it is not possible to subject the 
formula to any further examination. Speaking in general terms, we can only 
observe here the difficulty arises as with Kautsky, and that for the realisation 
of these "formulae for inherent costs" a monstrous giant brain would be 
necessary such as would be needed for the drawing up of the well-known "world 
equation" enunciated by Laplace; expressed in plain terms, this is as much to 
say that these "inherent cost formulae" are complete nonsense. It is for this 
reason that it should not cause us any astonishment if the much-prized "solution 
in principle" was found to be incapable of any practical application in Hungary, 
and that the demands of reality imposed upon their situation something quite 
different. In practice, the theory of <i>inherent social costs</i> was pushed 
aside by a <i>price policy</i>, from which we can draw the conclusion that in 
this case also the category of inherent social costs was dethroned and shown to 
be useless.</p>

<p class="fst">It would appear that, in the end outcome, the economists have 
applied the term Socially Necessary Labour (SNL) over far too wide a sphere, and 
that they have also included in its summation all those general costs of 
administration, etc., (See K. Marx: <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i>), 
which do not properly belong in the sphere of production at all; or else, at the 
opposite extreme, they have focused their attention too exclusively upon the 
collective end product, with the result that all the myriad different 
production-times adhering to hundreds of different products have been 
irretrievably mixed together (cf. Kautsky). In this particular form the category 
of Socially Necessary Labour (SNL) is indeed quite useless. Nevertheless, all 
labours performed in both reproduction and distribution are socially necessary. 
They must therefore be reproduced. The only possible solution is for each 
economic group to produce independently, whereby the entire SNL is reproduced.</p>

<p class="fst">We see, then, that the category SNL can find application only in 
respect of real use-value producing labour, and not in any 
administrative-accounting function. Reproduction of SNL is thus based upon and 
reflects the reproduction of each productive operation in the economy, and for 
that reason it is not the category SNL at all which is applicable to each 
separate work activity or particular division of the labour process; on the 
contrary, the decisive category applicable to each separate activity is that of 
Average Social Reproduction Time (ASRT). This is amenable to application in its 
widest sense by all "producers" and it is in this way that the problem of 
average social labour-time simultaneously finds its solution.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">2. Production Time and Reproduction Time</a></h3>

<p class="fst">We must now subject to further examination exactly why it is that 
reproduction time is applicable here and not production time; furthermore, we 
must also clarify to what extent these terms are synonymous and to what extent 
they are opposites.</p>

<p class="fst">To do this we must recall our original stipulation that each 
separate productive establishment must calculate the production time required 
for its product by application of the formula (p + c) + L; that is to say, it 
establishes how many hours of average social labour are contained in that 
particular product. Our outline then went on to show how Average Social 
Production Time was computed from the totality of all productive establishments 
joined in a single production group or "guild". The method according to which 
this computation is carried out ensures the simultaneous reproduction of the 
entire production group, and for this reason, in place of Average Social <i>
Production</i> Time, we name this the Average Social <i>Reproduction</i> Time. 
In this way the two in fact coincide. The difference between the <i>production</i> 
times of the separate (industrial) establishments and Average Social <i>
Reproduction</i> Time is subsumed within <i>the Productivity Factor</i>.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">3. Depreciation of the Means of Production</a></h3>

<p class="fst">It is an unwritten law for capitalist concerns that they must 
promote productivity to the maximum, since otherwise they will be pushed out of 
the market. For this reason they must strive to keep the wages of the workers as 
low as possible and to employ always the most productive machinery. Thus it 
often occurs that machines still capable of useful productive employment are 
scrapped. This, of course, represents a colossal waste of productive resources, 
and is characteristic of the capitalist mode of production. Seen from a strictly 
economic point of view, such an occurrence would mean that, in the case of a 
productive establishment equipped with obsolete means of production, production 
time would lie above the social average; or that, conversely, since the founding 
of the particular capitalist establishment in question, average social 
production time in that particular sector of the industrial economy had fallen 
due to rising average social productivity, and so had led to a relative increase 
in the production time applicable to the above obsolete establishment.</p>

<p class="fst">It is of course a conscious aim of the communist mode of 
production to reduce Average Social Production Time continuously. This has as 
its consequence a general fall in reproduction times. Expressed in capitalist 
terms, this is as much as to say that, at any given moment, means of production 
in the separate productive establishments have become <i>obsolete</i>. We must, 
therefore, now examine how this tendency expresses itself in a communist 
economy.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us take, for example, an industrial establishment in which 
the fixed means of production have been calculated at 100,000 labour-hours; let 
us assume further that these instruments of production are depreciated over a 
period of 10 years. In such a case 10,000 labour-hours per annum must be 
estimated as having to be taken into account in the product. However, should the 
average social reproduction time (asrt) of the means of production fall, the 
result of this would be that the establishment would be able, in its 
reproduction, to procure either the same quantity of machines of a better 
quality or a greater quantity of machines of the same quality - that is to say, 
the productivity of the establishment would have been raised. Expressed in other 
terms, this would mean that accumulation, or an extension of the production 
apparatus, would have taken place without the deployment of an extra outlay of 
labour.</p>

<p class="fst">For this establishment, a fall in the ASRT applicable to its 
means of production leads to a change in its production time and thereby also to 
its Productivity Factor. The is so for the simple reason that, in the final 
analysis, the ASRT must be included in the total calculation. The Average Social 
Production Time (ASPT) of the entire production group thus remains identical 
with the ASRT, for the simple reason that the means of production, seen as a 
statistical average, are used up and "flow through" the establishments as an 
uninterrupted stream. At any one moment this particular establishment will be 
modernised and renewed, at another moment another one, and so on. The lowest 
social reproduction times will thus, at any given moment, be continuously taken 
up by and reflected in the production process.</p>

<p class="fst">ASRT is therefore the decisive category for communist production. 
Just as, in the case of the capitalist economic system, the category Value 
(necessary and surplus value) stands at the centre of the entire economy, in the 
economic life of a communist society it is the category <i>Average Social 
Reproduction Time</i> which is the focal point around which everything revolves.</p>

<p class="fst">The foundation of ASRT is the <i>average social hour of labour</i>. 
It is, of course, true that this category also has some validity under 
capitalism. Here, however, the separate and peculiar characteristics of 
individual use-values can find no expression in their form as commodities, since 
in the market the product is exchanged for money, that is to say changed into 
that universal commodity which eliminates all individual characteristics. Under 
communism it is ASRT which subsumes within itself all individual 
characteristics, those of slower and more relaxed workers, those who are more 
capable or less capable, those who labour either by hand or by brain. Average 
Social Reproduction Time is thus a category which, as a thing-in-itself, as a 
specific parameter, has no material existence and like the laws of nature, which 
express only the general within which all specific phenomena reside, the Average 
Social Hour of Labour, which at the concrete level does not exist, expresses the 
general which is subsumed within the infinite many-sidedness of the social 
metamorphosis of materials.</p>
