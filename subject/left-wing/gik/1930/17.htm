<h1><a name="h0">The Agrarian Proletariat and the Small and Middle Peasants in the German 
Revolution</a></h1>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">1. The Struggle Begins</a></h3>

<p class="fst">When, in November 1918, imperial rule collapsed in Germany, this 
was not at its inception the result of the revolutionary activity of the working 
masses. The front had been pierced, the soldiers were deserting in their 
thousands. In this situation, the sea-lords of the German navy conceived the 
idea of a last great show of strength, to take the form of a desperate battle on 
the North Sea. The sailors believed, rightly or wrongly, that they would all 
find their deaths in this battle, and on the warships this then provoked 
desertions on a mass scale. Having once taken this course, the sailors were 
compelled to pursue it to the bitter end, because otherwise the crews which had 
mutinied, together with their ships, would have been shot to pieces by the 
"loyal" troops. For this reason they struck the red flag, and this became the 
signal for a general uprising of the sailors. With this the decisive action had 
been taken; the die was cast, and the sailors were forced to continue the 
struggle they had started. With an iron logic of its own, one action led to 
another. In this way they marched on Hamburg, in order to appeal for help from 
the workers there. How would they be received? Would they be repulsed?</p>

<p class="fst">Approaching Hamburg, there was no question of any resistance 
being offered to the revolutionary sailors. In their hundreds of thousands 
workers declared themselves in solidarity with them, whereupon all revolutionary 
activity found its expression in the Councils of Workers, Soldiers and Sailors, 
and the triumphal march of the German Revolution began to move throughout the 
whole of Germany. And here a peculiar feature of this revolutionary development 
began to make itself manifest: although the military censorship had controlled 
all reports concerning the Russian Revolution since 1917, and although for that 
reason absolutely no propaganda had been made on behalf of the Council concept, 
indeed in spite of the fact that the council structure of the Russian workers 
was completely unknown to the German workers, within a period of a few days an 
entire network of Workers' Councils had sprung up all over Germany!</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">2. The Revolution Spreads</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The civil war which now followed took place under the banner of 
socialism. On the one side stood Social Democracy, which embraced the cause of 
socialism. It understood this as a simple continuation of the process of 
concentration characteristic of capitalism, and which found its culmination in 
the <i>legal nationalisation</i> of large scale industry. Given such a movement, 
it was inevitable that the council movement, as the embodiment of the 
self-activity of the working masses, would be seen by Social Democracy as a 
threat which had to be destroyed. On the other side was newly-born communism, 
which conceived of the conversion of private property in means of production 
into socialised property as being attainable only be illegal means, that is to 
say as being embedded in the self-activity of the working masses themselves. The 
aim was the same, but the path leading to it a totally different one.</p>

<p class="fst">Although the occupation of the factories by the proletariat was 
in general carried through during the whole of this revolutionary period, 
nowhere did this come to an "appropriation in the name of society". The 
factories continued to be administered and managed by the old proprietors, they 
still remained <i>their property</i>, even if here and there this took place 
under the effective control of the workers.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">3. The Stalemate</a></h3>

<p class="fst">That the revolution did not develop any further can be attributed 
in the main to the fact that the revolutionary section of the proletariat needed 
all its strength merely to maintain its position over and against the mounting 
counter-revolution. This, under the leadership of Social Democracy, was 
concerned to prevent the onset of "social chaos" and the resort to autonomous 
("wildcat") nationalisation. For this reason the proletarian revolution was 
extremely weak. Many social groups were subdued by the revolution and compelled 
to choose, for good or for evil, the side of the victors of the moment, which 
ever side that might be. Nevertheless, in the end they were all driven into the 
arms of the counter-revolution, since the proletariat was still divided within 
itself and preoccupied with its own problems.</p>

<p class="fst">Although this is not the proper place to sketch out in full the 
course of the revolutionary civil war in Germany, it is necessary for us to 
devote some attention to a brief examination of this subject, because the 
attitude adopted by the agrarian proletariat and the small and middle peasants 
towards the revolution stands in close connection with that process and the 
entire course taken by the revolution.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">4. The Role of the Peasants</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The first characteristic to be noted here is that the peasantry 
did not constitute a strategic factor of any significance in the revolutionary 
process. They were, for instance, unable to develop their own independent 
organisations capable of playing an independent role. They also failed to form 
their own independent Councils, except in Bavaria. In that latter case, the 
peasants were forced to adopt a position which caused the same phenomenon to 
make its appearance where as in the case of the proletariat: they failed to 
assert themselves as a united force. A section of the peasantry chose the side 
of the revolution, the other section opposed it. Unfortunately we do not have at 
our disposal any data concerning the social characteristics of those formations 
which took up their position on the side of the revolution, nor of any accurate 
numerical estimation of the forces concerned.</p>

<p class="fst">With the exception of Bavaria, the peasantry barely played any 
role in the revolution. There was no question of their giving any direct 
support, and the general mood was clearly apathetic. The slogan: "All Land to 
the Peasants" clearly held no significance here, because small and middle-scale 
farming industry was decisively predominant. Whilst it may have sufficed for the 
peasant, given a backward situation in agriculture similar to that in Russia, to 
be given a strip of land as his private property, the modern economic conditions 
of Western Europe caused him to put forward quite different demands. Apart from 
a holding in land, appreciable capital resources in the form of means of 
production and raw materials were also necessary in order that the average 
social level of productivity typical of industry and the economy generally might 
be attained in agriculture also. Should those levels not be attained, the 
holdings fail to achieve profitability and so are unable to maintain themselves. 
In the conditions of a highly developed agriculture, the same slogan which in 
Russia was capable of releasing such colossal social forces, here, made on sense 
at all for the small peasants.</p>

<p class="fst">However, there still exists in Germany extensive territories in 
which large-scale estate ownership is predominant. This then poses the question 
as to the extent to which the agrarian proletariat here showed any desire or 
tendency to follow the Russian example of carrying through land distribution. In 
this connection it must be said quite baldly: nothing of the kind made itself 
apparent. The production relations characteristic of large-scale land ownership 
in Germany effectively prevented the emergence of any such tendencies. If, in 
the case of a backward agrarian economy, the idea-world of the poor peasant 
starved of land naturally revolves around a forcible distribution of the large 
estates, by the same token, given scientific methods of farming as implemented 
on the large German estates, characterised as they were by a high degree of 
specialisation, the only ideology capable in such conditions of independent 
development and of expressing itself as an independent social force was and 
could only be that of common ownership with communal methods of operation.</p>

<p class="fst">On the other hand, an objection which could with some validity be 
raised against this view is that a given technical level of development does not 
always or necessarily express itself as the dominant factor in the ideology of 
the landed population, because the force of tradition always plays an important 
part in the latter's motivations. Nevertheless, the profound interconnection 
between production relations and ideology can be clearly perceived as lying at 
the root of the problem as we have portrayed it.</p>

<p class="fst">In the case of large-scale land ownership in Germany, organised 
production is organised as an industry, since it is laid out on the basis of 
modern science and technique. The large arable fields are worked with modern 
machinery, grain is stored in large silos and processed by machinery. In the 
cattle farming areas, the grazing meadows are of extensive size and equipped 
with milking sheds capable of housing hundreds of cows, whilst on-the-spot 
dairies exist for the preparation of the milk. The potato fields in the north of 
the country are exclusively organised for specialisation in this form of 
agriculture, and the distilleries are directly connected to them. In the 
province of Saxony, where everything is specialised for the production of beet 
crops for the processing in the neighbouring sugar factories of Magdeburg, 
Aachen, etc., very similar conditions pertain. Under such conditions the slogan: 
"All Land to the Peasants!" can find no basis for support whatsoever in the 
sense of a distribution of land according to the Russian example. The 
agricultural workers would have no conception of what to do with such land. In 
the sphere of animal husbandry, they might be able to procure for themselves a 
piece of land and a couple of cows, but since their dwellings are not equipped 
as farms, they would be unable to pursue any cattle-rearing or dairy-farming 
operations there. In addition, there would be a complete absence of those farm 
implements necessary for the exploitation of their holdings. These conditions 
are valid throughout the whole area of the large landed estates of Germany, and, 
for all the reasons stated, we can conclude with certainty that a high level of 
development in agriculture precludes the validity of any measures for 
distributing the land.</p>

<p class="fst">The agricultural workers who work on such estates form the true 
agricultural proletariat. The perspective they face is the same as that 
confronting the industrial workers, that is to say, the prospect of the 
"appropriation of the whole of industry in the name of society". If the 
industrial proletariat was proved in practice to be too weak to tackle seriously 
the revolutionary tasks associated with the achievement of communism, in the 
case of the agrarian proletariat maters did not develop even to the point at 
which those tasks could be posed. The agrarian production relations themselves 
ensure that thousands of proletarians are unable to acquire the necessary 
qualities of solidarity within a small occupational area, with the result that a 
common front of struggle can come into being only with the greatest difficulty. 
For this reason, the agricultural proletariat did not succeed in forming, or was 
barely able to form, its own Councils, and thus its role in the German 
revolution was barely of any significance.</p>

<p class="fst">On the other hand, the attitude adopted by the so-called 
semi-proletariat in the countryside is worthy of note. There exists in Germany a 
considerable industrial presence in the countryside, a phenomenon which is also 
making its appearance to an increasing extent in other countries. This may be 
attributed to the availability of cheap labour-power and to lower land prices 
and taxes. Since the labour force required is recruited from amongst the peasant 
population in the neighbouring territory, and these workers frequently work in 
their spare time on their fairly large holdings of land, they tend to take up an 
immediate position which we term that of a semi-proletariat. The type of 
agriculture pursued by them is that of the closed domestic economy. The role 
they play as a market force is insufficient to be of any overall economic 
significance.</p>

<p class="fst">The characteristic feature of which to take note at this point is 
that this semi-proletariat came to represent a force in the revolution which 
nothing could hold back or intimidate. Time after time they were in the vanguard 
of the movement; it was they who were in the fore during the uprising and 
marched to all the neighbouring cities in order to give the struggle a broader 
base. Thuringia is a typical example of this. Additionally, these workers 
fulfilled an exemplary role in the task of supplying the cities with essential 
foodstuffs. At the beginning of the revolution, when the Councils still held 
power, the peasantry tended to hoard these foodstuffs in order to screw the 
prices up as high as possible. In order to take measures against this, the 
Councils in the cities made contact with the Councils holding power in the 
neighbouring factories in the countryside, and the semi-proletarians, who were 
fully acquainted with the situation there, brought measures to bear to persuade 
the peasants to release their products against fixed prices. This, for instance, 
is what occurred in Hamburg and district.</p>

<p class="fst">Summarising the above, we can say that, in general, neither the 
German agrarian proletariat nor the German peasantry took part in any decisive 
way in the revolution. Even if, in the case of the agrarian proletariat, 
communist ideas were already present to some extent, they were nevertheless 
still extremely weakly developed and were unable to find any effective 
expression in revolutionary practice. This would seem to give substance to the 
view that, with the onset of a proletarian revolution, the peasantry in the main 
tends to adopt an attitude of "wait and see". The general stance they adopt will 
tend to be determined by the strength of the revolutionary forces, and also by 
the degree to which the large agricultural estates are or are not successfully 
integrated into the new-born and developing communist mode of production.</p>
