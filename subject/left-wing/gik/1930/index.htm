<p class="information"><i>Fundamental Principles of Communist Production and 
Distribution</i> is the classic exposition of the economics of communism 
<font face="Times New Roman">&#8211;</font> and, 
indeed, apart from the first outline sketches given by Marx in his <i>Critique 
of The Gotha Programme</i>, upon which the book is based, the <i>only</i> one 
ever to have been produced. The first working draft was the work of the 
well-known German proletarian revolutionary and veteran member of the KAPD,
Jan Appel, alias Max Hempel. This draft was subsequently revised and completed in 
Dutch by a collective composed of members of the <i>Group of International 
Communists of Holland</i> (GIK) and published in German by the <i>Allgemeine 
Arbeiterunion Deutschlands</i> (General Workers' Union of Germany) in 1930. It does 
for communist society what Marx's <i>Capital</i> did for capitalism and is perhaps the 
most advanced intellectual achievement of the German Revolution.</p>

<p class="information">The economic preconditions for communism are shown to reside in 
the abolition of wage-labour, money and all value-determined production and 
distribution, and their replacement by a system of use-value production 
regulated through the Average Social Hour of Labour. One of the most remarkable 
features of the work is the clear and profound treatment given to the process 
through which the lower stage of communism progressively "abolishes" itself in 
achieving the transition from the lower to the higher stage of communism.</p>

<p class="information">The collapse of State Socialism in the USSR and Eastern Bloc 
lends a very considerable significance to this historic document of the German 
and Dutch revolutionary movement. In its pages, communist, socialists and 
libertarians today may discover the basic flaws in the economic system laid down 
for the USSR by Lenin and the Bolshevik Party. Thanks to this work, attention is 
focused on the apparently so simple but so easily overlooked fact that the 
Bolshevik system of State Socialism <i>rests upon no objective mode of social 
regulation whatsoever</i>, and consequently is dependent upon the subjective 
diktat of an army of major and minor bureaucrats which, as the ruling elite 
organised in an all-powerful party dictatorship fused in with the State, 
effectively deprived the mass of the working population of all control over the 
economic process. It is this which formed the economic foundation for the 
horrendous tyranny with which the world had for so long been familiar, just as 
it also revealed the Bolshevik system to be a false model of socialism or 
communism which misled the world for over 70 years!</p>

<p class="sub">COMMENT:</p>

<p class="information">As the translators introduction makes clear, the following text 
represents an advance on the theory of the post-capitalist economy as posited by 
Marx. One of the many strengths of the text is the insistence throughout that 
for any non-exploitative system to actually work <i>all</i> participants must 
understand its economic foundations. As well as making redundant the economic 
'expert' of the old capitalist system, the post-capitalist economy also 
undertook to make redundant that penultimate twister, charlatan and sycophant of 
the rich <font face="Times New Roman">&#8211;</font> the politician. To this end, the many levels of bureaucratic 
job-creation schemes for the middle class of the old society were to be 
abolished, and the only mechanism between the desires of the people and the 
practical necessities required to fulfil those desires was to be the workers' 
council. The workers' councils were to be everything the present parliamentary 
system is not. The peoples voice was to be taken at literal value through the 
workers' councils situated in the workplaces and neighbourhoods. Representative 
spokes-people could, if they distorted or manipulated the decisions of the 
council be recalled and instantly dismissed. Unlike the pampered parliamentary 
snakes and misrepresentives of the people of the present (capitalist) system, 
the economic system of the communist society would automatically delete from its 
ranks of delegates the power-seekers, the leeches, the money-mongers and the 
lay-abouts that constitute in total the parliamentary benches of today. Quite 
how this is done is also a rewarding aspect to the close study of this text.</p>

<p class="information">This edition of <i>Fundamental Principles of Communist Production 
and Distribution</i> is taken directly from the first English translation of the 
German text by Mike Baker (deceased) of the Movement for Workers' Councils, a 
London based group founded in 1989 and now long since dis-established. A printed 
edition was published, but issues of poor quality and the inclusion of 
extraneous and irrelevant material has made this virtual publication a 
necessity.</p>

<p class="information">We wish to encourage some debate upon 
the crucial need to take seriously questions surrounding the whole nature of the 
post-capitalist economy and wider society. Despite the tendency of the following 
text to generate more problems than it attempts to solve, this is more 
indicative of the non-proscriptive thread of argument rather than of any 
fundamental flaw. Leaving such thorny issues such as those which are honestly 
dealt with by the authors of <i>Fundamental Principles...</i> to future 
generations or to some magical and loose hypothesis which supposes all such 
matters will come right in the end is, in effect, a dereliction of revolutionary 
responsibilities. To ask the workers of the world to vanquish capitalism into 
the historical realm of barbaric societies, there must be at least an idea of 
the new society worth fighting for.</p>
