<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">1. Under Capitalism Reproduction is a Function of the Individual Capitalist 
Groups</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Humanity has fashioned for itself the apparatus of social 
production as an organ for the satisfaction of its thousandfold needs. The 
productive apparatus - that is say, the collective means of production - serves 
human society as a tool with which to wring from nature that which necessary to 
its existence and higher development. In the course of manufacture, the 
production process, both our labour-power and the objective apparatus itself, 
are consumed. Seen in this way, the production process is also a process of 
destruction, of the using up of resources. But it is simultaneously a process of 
creation. What has been used up is in the same process born again: machines, 
tools and our labour-power are consumed and simultaneously renewed, produce and 
reproduce themselves over and over again. The social production process proceeds 
like the life process itself in the human body. Through self-destruction to 
self-renewal in a continuous ever more complex form:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Whatever the social form of the production process, it has to be 
continuous, it must periodically repeat the same phases. A society can no more 
cease to produce than it can cease to consume. When viewed, therefore, as a 
connected whole, and in the constant flux of its incessant renewal, every social 
process of production is at the same time a process of reproduction."<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">For communism, this paragraph acquires an especial significance, 
because production and reproduction are consciously derived from this principle, 
whilst in the case of capitalism the process completes itself spontaneously 
through the market mechanism. Reproduction rests on the fact that, for each 
product consumed, a new one generally must take its place. In the case of 
communist society, this means that an exact account must be kept into everything 
entering the production process. However difficult this may appear to be, it 
reality it is quite simple, because everything which has been used up and 
destroyed may be classified under two categories: <i>means of production</i> and <i>
labour-power</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Under capitalism reproduction is an individual function. Each 
single capitalist, the unit of capital, attends to their own reproduction needs. 
The capitalist takes account of the fixed means of production worn out and used 
up (machines, buildings), the consumption of circulating means of production 
(raw materials and auxiliary materials) and the labour-power directly expended. 
To these are then added supplementary expenditures, such as marketing costs, 
insurance, etc., and finally the capitalist goes to market with the finished 
commodities. Should the business be successful, a period of production is 
therefore successfully concluded. The capitalist now purchases new means of 
production and new labour-power and production can once again commence anew. 
Since all capitalists act in the same way, the result is that the entire system 
of production, together with the labour-power expended, are reproduced. The 
development of technique, and the increasing productivity of the production 
system resulting therefrom, compels the capitalists, through competition, to 
invest a part of their surplus-value in additional capital, in new means of 
production and in an enlarged productive apparatus. The result is the growth of 
an ever-mightier productive inventory, the "dead" as well as the "living" parts 
of the productive apparatus. Thus it is not only those means of production which 
have been used up and destroyed in the previous production period that are 
reproduced, but - to use the relevant capitalist terminology - <i>accumulation</i> 
takes place. The decision as to the scale on which this is to operate and in 
whose factories it is to be effected is a function of the individual capitalist 
or capitalist group, whose motives are bound up with the struggle for profit.</p>

<p class="fst">Under communism, accumulation is termed <i>reproduction on an 
extended scale</i>. Here, the market and the transformation of commodities 
(products) into money are eliminated, but the stream of products remains:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Within the co-operative commonwealth based on the social 
ownership of the means of production, the producers do not exchange their 
products; just as little of the labour embodied in the products appear here as 
the value of these products, as a material quality possessed by them, since now, 
in contrast to capitalist society, the individual labour no longer exists as an 
indirectly but as a directly constituent part of the total labour".<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">"Here obviously the same principle prevails as that which 
regulates the exchange of commodities so far as this exchange is of equal 
values. Content and form are changed because under the changed conditions no one 
contribute anything except their labour and, on the other hand, nothing can pass 
into the possession of individuals except individual objects of consumption. 
But, so as the distribution of the latter among individual producers is 
concerned, the same principle prevails as in the exchange of 
commodity-equivalents, i.e. equal quantities of labour in one form are exchanged 
for equal quantities of labour in another form".<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus the industrial establishments place their products at the 
disposal of society. Nevertheless, the latter must for its part supply the 
factories with new means of production, raw materials and labour-power, in the 
same quantities which originally entered into production. Indeed, if production 
on an extended scale is to be achieved, a greater quantity of means of 
production, etc., must be supplied to the factories. The competent decisions 
concerning this, however, no longer remain in the hands of private capitalist 
groups owning means of production, but society as a whole determines the degree 
to which production is to be enlarged, to the extent that this is required for 
the satisfaction of social and individual needs. If it is the case that new 
means of production must be supplied to each factory, in the same quantities as 
those which have been used up in production, then for reproduction to take place 
it is necessary and sufficient that each factory calculates how much social 
product it has used up in various forms (also in the form of labour 
certificates). These are then replaced in the same quantities, and a new labour 
period can begin.</p>

<p class="fst">If we should ask to what extent it is possible to determine the 
number of labour-hours used up in each industrial establishment, it is modern 
cost-accountancy which provides the decisive answer. For reasons that need not 
be elaborated upon here, capitalist methods of industrial accumulation were 
compelled, around 1921, to proceed with a thoroughgoing rationalisation, and it 
was in this way that there appeared, around 1922, an entire new literature 
concerned with the development of new methods for calculating the exact 
cost-price for each separate productive process and for each separate subsidiary 
labour function. This was made up of many factors, such as: quantities of means 
of production, raw materials and auxiliary materials used up, labour power, and 
the administrative costs of each separate partial productive process or special 
partial labour function: transport, social insurance, etc. They are, however, 
all related to one common denominator: <i>money</i>, and it is this which the 
industrial administrator sees as a hindrance standing in the way of exact 
accounting. But nothing stands in the way of converting them into another 
accounting unit. Also, the formula in its present form is often unstable in 
conditions of socialised production, because various factors which appear in the 
cost budget - for instance, interest on capital - would then be no longer 
relevant. The method itself, however, remains an enduring advance. In this 
respect also the new society is born within the womb of the old! Leichter writes 
in respect of modern cost-accountancy:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Capitalist methods of accounting control can, if introduced into 
a factory consistently and free of snags, provide exact data revealing the value 
of any half-produced article, any piece of work still in process of manufacture, 
or pinpoint the costs of each separate labour operation. They can determine in 
which amongst many different workshops in a factory, in which amongst many 
different machines or many different units of labour-power a particular labour 
operation may be more economically carried out; that is to say, they can at any 
time be used to increase the highest degree of rationalisation achieved by the 
manufacturing process. To this must be added yet a further achievement of 
capitalist accounting methods: in every large factory there are a number of 
costs and expenses which make no tangible contribution to the exchangeable 
product." (Meant here are such things as the salaries of officials, heating 
costs of the workplace, etc. - the Authors) ... "It should equally be counted 
among the great achievements of capitalist accounting methods that it has 
enabled these detailed costs to be included in the total works budget."<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">2. The Formula (P + C) + L = TOTAL PRODUCT (T. PRD)</a></h3>

<p class="fst">For this reason it is perfectly possible to impress upon each 
product how many labour-hours its production has cost. There are, of course, 
certain installations which produce no tangible product, such as the social and 
economic councils, the health service, education and so on; but these also are 
just as well able to determine how many labour-hours in means of production and 
labour-power they have consumed, so that here also the costs of reproduction can 
be exactly revealed. Should we wish to make a concise definition of 
reproduction, then we would say: MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND LABOUR-POWER ARE THE 
DIRECTLY OPERATIVE FACTORS IN PRODUCTION. IN ASSOCIATION WITH NATURE, THERE 
ARISES OUT OF THEIR INTERACTION A MASS OF PRODUCTS IN THE USE-VALUE FORM OF 
MACHINES, BUILDINGS, FOODSTUFFS, RAW MATERIALS ETC. ON THE ONE SIDE, THIS MASS 
OF PRODUCTS MOVES FROM FACTORY TO FACTORY IN AN UNBROKEN STREAM; AND ON THE 
OTHER SIDE, IT IS USED UP IN THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THE CONSUMERS.</p>

<p class="fst">Each factory secures its reproduction through an exact accounting 
of means of production ( = p) and labour ( = L ), expressed in labour-hours. The 
production formula for each factory is therefore expressed as follows:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">p + L = product</p>

<p class="fst">As is well known the Marxist category "means of production" 
comprises machinery and buildings (fixed means of production), and also raw 
materials and auxiliary materials (circulating means of production). If now we 
use for fixed means of production the letter p and for the circulating means of 
production the letter c, then the formula takes on the following form:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">( p + c ) + L = product</p>

<p class="fst">If for the sake of clarity we now replace the letters by 
fictitious figures, then production in, for instance, a shoe factory would 
reveal the following schematic:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">( p + c ) + L = product</p>

<p class="fst">that is</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">( machinery + raw material ) + Labour = 40000 pairs of shoes, 
that is, in labour-hours (L-Hrs)<br>
(1250 L-Hrs + 61250 L-Hrs) + 62500 L-Hrs = 125000 Labour-Hours.</p>

<p class="fst">therefore to average:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">125000 <i>Labour-Hours</i><br>
<i>divided by</i><br>
40000 pairs of shoes<br>
<i>equals</i> 3.125 <i>Labour-Hours</i> per pair of shoes.</p>

<p class="fst">In this formula for production, the factory simultaneously finds 
its formula for reproduction, which shows how many Labour-Hours representing 
social product must be restored to it in order to renew everything that has been 
used up.</p>

<p class="fst">That which applies for each separate industrial establishment 
also holds good for the whole communist economy. In this sense, the latter is 
only the sum of all the economic installations active at any given moment in the 
economy. The same is also valid for the total social product. It is nothing 
other than the product ( p + c ) + L for the total of all economic 
establishments. In order to distinguish this from the sphere of production 
accounting control for the separate industrial establishments, we use for the 
total product the formula:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">(P + C ) + L = Total Product</p>

<p class="fst">If we assume the sum of all used up machinery - ( P ) - in all 
the industrial installations = 100,000,000 Labour-Hours and that for raw 
materials - ( C ) = 600,000,000 Labour-Hours; and if also 600,000,000 
Labour-Hours of living labour-power - ( L ) - were consumed, then the schematic 
for total social production would appear as follows:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">( P + C ) + L = Total Product<br>
( 100 million + 600 million ) + 600 million = 1300 million Labour- Hours</p>

<p class="fst">All industrial installations taken together thus take out of the 
total social stock 700,000,000 Labour-Hours of product in order to reproduce the 
physical part of the productive apparatus, whilst the workers consume 
600,000,000 Labour-Hours of the final social product. In this way the 
reproduction of all the production elements is assured.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us now consider the reproduction of labour-power in 
particular. In our example 600,000,000 Labour-Hours are available for individual 
consumption. More than this cannot and must not be consumed, because in the 
industrial establishments only 600,000,000 Labour-Hours in the form of labour 
certificates has been accounted for. This however bears no relation to how that 
product is to be distributed amongst the workers. It is, for instance, quite 
possible that unskilled, skilled and intellectual labour will all be remunerated 
differently. Distribution could, for instance, be carried out on such a basis 
that the unskilled receive three-quarters of an hour pro rata for each one hour 
performed, the skilled exactly one hour and the officials and fore-persons three 
hours.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">3. The Concept of Value Held by the Socialist Economists</a></h3>

<p class="fst">And indeed, their Excellencies the economists do in fact, 
consider that distribution should be arranged in this way! It never even occurs 
to them to place an equal value on labour, that is to say, to apportion to each 
the same share of the social product. This, of course, is the significance of 
Neurath's "varying standards of living". The social statisticians determine the 
minimum standard necessary, to which the income of the "unskilled" workers is 
then made to correspond, whilst others receive a more generous remuneration 
according to their industriousness, their capabilities and the importance of 
their labour. A purely capitalist mode of thought!</p>

<p class="fst">Kautsky considers this difference in remuneration to be 
necessary, because he believes that higher wages should be paid for unpleasant 
or onerous forms of labour as compared with the more pleasant and lighter tasks. 
He remarks in passing that, for him, this provides evidence to prove that 
labour-time accounting is impracticable. In this, indeed, he agrees with 
Leichter, going so far as to suggest that differences in remuneration should be 
retained even within each occupation, because, in his view, it would be 
inevitable that the actual wage paid out to individuals would in certain cases 
rise above the basic rate in order to take account of the additional training 
needed by the skilled workers, etc. Those who think like him take, for instance, 
the view that wage tariffs should be retained in the communist economy. As 
against this, Leichter notes quite correctly that this does not hinder in any 
way the introduction of Labour-Hour accounting, a fact which we can also see 
from our example. He says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"There exists the purely technical difficulty, which exists also 
under capitalism, that the wages to be paid for each separate labour function 
must be separately determined, but this offers no special complications as 
compared with the method used under capitalism".<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Here we see that Leichter considers a differing scale of 
evaluation of labour, the application of differing rates, indeed variations 
within the same type of labour, to be in principle correct. This, however, 
expresses nothing other than the fact that in such a society <i>the struggle for 
improved conditions of labour has not ceased</i>, that distribution of the 
social product still bears an antagonistic character and that the struggle for 
the distribution of the product still continues. This struggle is in reality 
nothing other than <i>a struggle for power</i> and would have to be conducted as 
such.</p>

<p class="fst">No clearer evidence could be offered than that given above to 
prove that these 'socialists' are inherently incapable of conceiving of any form 
of society other than the one in which forms of rule and domination are 
exercised over millions of workers. For them, human beings have become simply 
subjects. They are nothing more than parts of the productive apparatus, for whom 
it is necessary that the social statisticians calculate how much food and other 
necessities must be supplied to this human material (minimum subsistence 
standard of living) in order to ensure that labour-power is able to renew 
itself. The working class must struggle against such a viewpoint with all its 
strength and demand <i>for all</i> the <i>same</i> share in the riches of 
society.</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, in the first stages of a communist society, it may 
at first be necessary that various intellectual occupations be remuneration at a 
higher level; that, for instance, 40 hours of labour gives the right to 80 or 
120 hours of product. We have already seen that this represents no difficulty 
for the method of labour-time accounting. At the beginning of the communist form 
of society this could indeed be a just measure, if for instance the means of 
higher education were not available to everyone free of charge, because society 
is not yet sufficiently thoroughly organised on the new basis. As soon, however, 
as these matters have been ordered, then there can no longer be any question of 
giving the intellectual professions a larger share in the social product.</p>

<p class="fst">The basic cause underlying the fact that the 'socialist' 
economists are unable to free themselves from the concept of a varying 
evaluation of labour-power lies, amongst other things, in the class situation 
which they find themselves. An equal distribution of the total product totally 
contradicts their class sense and is for that reason "impossible". That 
conscious thought-concepts derive in the main from the world of feeling or 
sensibility is, however, if not exactly an ancient, then at least a correct 
principle, and for these people as for others the intellect does not in general 
contradict what the world of feeling dictates. It is this which explains, for 
instance, how it comes about that Leichter may wish to eliminate the concept of 
value as it applies to impersonal reproduction, but is unable to free himself 
from it where the remuneration of labour-power is concerned. In capitalist 
society labour-power appears as a commodity. The average wage paid by the 
employer corresponds to the cost of reproducing labour-power which, in the case 
of unskilled labour, lie more or less at the level of the minimum necessary for 
existence. The children of unskilled workers are as a general rule unable to 
learn a profession, because it is necessary for them to commence earning as much 
as possible as early as possible.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> This establishes a situation in which 
unskilled labour reproduces itself only as more unskilled labour-power. For the 
reproduction of skilled labour-power more is necessary. In this latter case the 
children are trained for a profession, and this means that the skilled workers 
have themselves reproduced skilled labour-power. According to Leichter this 
commodity relationship for labour-power applies under "socialism". He writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Thus labour reveals various qualifications, various intensities 
of labour. The various qualitatively differing labour-powers require for their 
reproduction a differing level of investment. Qualified workers require more in 
order to reproduce their labour-power from day to day or year to year, that is 
to say, their current expenditures are larger. A greater investment is in 
general required to train and promote qualified labour up to its completion, up 
to a standard of a human being with the same replacement level of education and 
knowledge, if the person formerly bearing the responsibility for this developing 
labour-power is no longer capable of work. All this must be taken into account 
in evaluating the values to be attributed to the various labour-powers."<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">If we now compare this with Marx's analysis of the price of 
labour-power under capitalism, it then becomes completely crystal clear that the 
so-called 'socialist' economists are unable to free themselves from the value 
concept:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"<i>What</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>is the cost of production of 
labour-power?</i></p>

<p class="fst"><i>It is a cost required for maintaining the worker as a worker 
and of developing him into a worker.</i>"</p>

<p class="fst">The less the period of training, therefore, that any work 
requires, the smaller is the cost of production of the worker, and lower is the 
price of the worker's labour i.e., the wages. In those branches of industry in 
which hardly any period of apprenticeship is required and where the mere bodily 
existence of the worker suffices, the cost necessary for the worker's production 
is almost confined to the commodities necessary for keeping the worker alive and 
capable of working. The <i>price of the worker's labour</i> will, therefore, be 
determined by the <i>price of the necessary means of subsistence</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">... In the same way, in calculating the cost of production of 
simple labour-power, there must be included the cost of reproduction, whereby 
the race of workers is enabled to multiply and to replace worn out workers with 
new ones. Thus the depreciation of the worker is taken into account in the same 
way as the depreciation of the machine:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The cost of production of simple labour-power, therefore, 
amounts to the <i>cost of existence and reproduction of the worker</i>. The 
price of this cost of existence and reproduction constitutes wages. Wages so 
determined are called the <i>wage minimum</i>."<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In exactly the same way as the reproduction of the impersonal 
part of the productive apparatus is, under capitalism, a function of the 
individual capitalist group, in a similar way the reproduction of labour-power 
under that system is an individual function of the worker. Under communism, 
however, in the same way as the reproduction of the impersonal part of the 
reproductive apparatus becomes a social function, the reproduction of 
labour-power becomes a social function likewise. It is no longer made the 
responsibility of separate individuals, but is borne by the whole of society. 
Educational attainment, for instance, is no longer dependent on papa's purse, 
but is dependent solely upon the talents, the mental and physical 
characteristics, of the child. It would occur to nobody under communism that 
individuals who by nature have already been equipped with more favourable 
inherited characteristics or more advantageous inherent capacities, and who for 
that reason are able to absorb to the fullest degree all the achievements of 
human society in the fields of culture, art and science, should be additionally 
awarded a greater share in the social product. Society offers them the 
possibility of realising achievements above the ordinary in art and scientific 
knowledge, but only in order that they may return to society, in the form of a 
more talented and more intense cooperation in all cultural tasks, those values 
which were originally taken out of society in the form of cultural products. The 
distribution of the social product under communism is not a simple reproduction 
of labour-power, but a distribution of all physical and spiritual riches which 
have been created by society through all its technical and other resources. The 
aim which 'socialists' of the stamp of Kautsky, Leichter and Neurath are 
actually seeking to achieve with their principle of "remuneration according to 
differing living standards" is in reality that of securing for the lower-paid 
workers the minimum standard of living necessary for existence on the basis of 
nutritional and other domestic and family assessments, whilst the more highly 
paid consume the surplus. Their thought is in reality far removed from any idea 
of the elimination of exploitation. Indeed, they wish to continue exploitation, 
only this time on the basis of the common ownership of the means of production!</p>

<p class="fst">For us the reproduction of labour power can only mean that the 
social product is equally distributed. In calculating production time, the 
number of labour-hours expended are entered in their actual quantity, whilst 
each worker draws out from the social product the actual number of labour-hours 
the worker has expended.</p>

<p class="fst">In that kind of 'socialism' which reflects and is based upon 
"minimum standard of living" statistics, the producers give up their 
labour-power to a great undefined authority which is euphemistically called 
"society". However, wherever this undefined authority actually takes on a 
tangible form, it appears as an alien force over and against the producers, a 
force which has elevated itself above them, and exploits them and rules over 
them. It is in reality domination by and through the apparatus of production, an 
apparatus which is now a state system in which producers play a role as faceless 
elements.</p>
