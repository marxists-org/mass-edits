<h4>CHAPTER 16</h4>
<h1><a name="h0">The Agrarian Revolution in Russia and Hungary</a></h1>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">1. Russia</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The solution to the agrarian problem adopted in Russia holds 
little relevance for the development of the agrarian revolution in Western 
Europe. Agriculture there was still at the pre-capitalist stage of relations, 
typified by the large landed estates, frequently combined with a self-sufficient 
domestic economy. It was for this reason that, in Russia, the capitalist slogan 
"All land to the peasants!" meant the realisation of freedom and equality ... 
just as it had meant the same thing to the French peasants when they had won 
those rights in 1789. For them, their significance consisted in the fact that 
they obtained for themselves a piece of private land, on which they could live 
in whatever way they wished. The right demanded by the Russian peasant was that 
of making his appearance on the social stage as a capitalist, as the 
simultaneous alienator of commodities and beneficiary of production. This, of 
course, was also the reason why he soon began to agitate against the Soviet 
government and thereby won for himself full freedom of internal trade.</p>

<p class="fst">Therewith began in Russia that capitalist development of 
agriculture which we here in Western Europe have long since passed. The Russians 
refer with exaggerated gestures to what they call the growth of communism on the 
land. By this they mean that the peasants have combined into cooperatives in 
order to make effective use for themselves of the advantages of modern 
technology, a common price policy and a collective machinery for bulk purchase 
and marketing. By these means the Russian peasant, following exactly the path 
taken by his class comrades in Western Europe, is motivated by the necessity of 
winning for himself a strong position in the market, in order thereby to attain 
the highest possible profit. We can see from all this that the agricultural 
"communism" proclaimed with such a flourish by the Bolsheviks is in fact far 
further advanced in Western Europe than it is in Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">It is therefore no cause for wonder that we can find little of 
value to learn from the Russians in the question of agrarian economic relations 
in the communist sense. There is, of course, no question there of any 
agricultural organisation being entrusted with its own management and 
administration, if for no other reason than that all property in means of 
production is still privately owned.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">2. Hungary</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Soviet Hungary offers a totally different picture of the course 
of development taken by the revolution. Here, small-scale landed property was 
left untouched, whilst the large and middle holdings were disappropriated by 
decree without, however, any distribution of the land to the peasants being 
carried into effect. Matters could take this turn in Hungary because there the 
peasants were as innocent of any active role in the revolution as newborn babes. 
Varga describes this as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In Hungary there was no revolution in the proper sense of the 
word. Power fell into the lap of the proletarians, so to speak, legally and more 
or less overnight. In the countryside there was no more than a minuscule 
revolutionary movement, but on the other hand also no armed resistance. For this 
reason it was possible to carry out a <i>legal</i> disappropriation of holdings 
without any opposition, and the large landed estates were retained intact. ... 
We emphasise the word <i>legal</i>, since it must be openly admitted that, in 
the majority of cases, disappropriation was carried out by purely legal means, 
and that in many cases this brought about so little social change that the 
population in the countryside often possessed no clear understanding that 
disappropriation had taken place at all ... In those cases in what the former 
estate owner remained in command of the disappropriated estate as a 
state-employed manager, for the time being at least no change whatever took 
place. The former estate owner remained in the same superior dwelling, drove 
with the same coach-and-four, permitted himself to be addressed as before as 
'Sir'. The whole consisted merely in the fact that he no longer possessed the 
power of his former property as he wished without let or hindrance, but was 
compelled to follow the directives of the estate administration. Of this, the 
agricultural worker noticed very little; the sole significance the revolution 
held for him was that he was now in receipt of a much higher income than 
before." (E. Varga: <i>Die wirtschaftspolitischen Probleme der proletarischen 
Diktatur</i>, p. 103).</p>

<p class="fst">However, matters did not take the same course everywhere. Some of 
the large landed estates were declared to be productive associations, in which 
there was a semblance of management and administration having apparently been 
placed in the hands of the workers.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The separate estates were formed into production cooperatives. 
The cooperatives of a given district were combined under a common district 
management. All such production cooperatives were combined to form the 
'Provincial Management Centre of the Agricultural Production Cooperatives', 
which then came directly under the control of the Department for Arable 
Cultivation of the Supreme Economic Council. This particular form of production 
cooperative was chosen on account of the social backwardness of the agricultural 
workers. Had we declared the large estates to be simply state property, the wage 
demands of the workers would have been limitless, whilst the intensity of labour 
would have fallen to a minimum. By adopting this method, however, the 
possibility of exerting pressure for a certain level of labour discipline and 
intensity was obtained, on the grounds the net yield of the estate accrues to 
the workers themselves. Another result of adopting this method was that the 
demands of the agricultural workers that legal title of the land should become 
their own personal property was satisfied to some degree. ... These concessions 
possessed little significance in practice, since the accounting procedures 
(book-keeping) were held under central administration. The intention, of course, 
was that, after a period sufficient for the educational enlightenment of the 
workers had passed, the disappropriated landed estates would be openly declared 
to be state property and the workers to be state employees, with exactly the 
same status as the industrial workers". (E. Varga: ibid, p. 105).</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">3. The Result</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Such a statement criticises itself! Varga states quite openly: 
"Give the workers no more than the appearance that production is being managed 
and administered by themselves. In reality this has little significance, since 
we dispose of the central machinery of administration, and it is this central 
administration which determines, by means of price policy, just what the net 
income of the workers shall be". All this offers a clear demonstration of how 
necessary it is that the relationship of the producers to the social product be 
determined <i>in the objective production process itself</i>, so as to ensure 
that a new form of class rule cannot arise behind the mask of democracy.</p>

<p class="fst">No purpose is served by discussing in detail the particular 
features of the agricultural economy in Soviet Hungary. The sole conclusion 
which it is appropriate to draw is that the examples of "communist" production 
provided by both Russia and Hungary yield a discouraging picture. In the case of 
Russia, the peasants acted in a purely capitalistic way. "The peasants 
distributed the land and carried off the agricultural means of production, 
whereby it was not the poorest but the most prosperous peasants who received the 
largest share" (Varga, page 103). In the case of Hungary, they did not act at 
all, which means that up to the present we have no example of how an agrarian 
proletariat and the small and middle peasants might behave towards a proletarian 
revolution under West European conditions. Which ideology would become the 
predominant one in that case? Would they also participate in the revolution in 
an organised way, and if so in what form? We do not know. The only course open 
to us is to examine the attitude they adopted towards the proletarian 
revolutions of 1918-1923.</p>
