<h1><a name="h0">In Place of a Preface</a></h1>

<p class="fst">The following work, the fruit of a collective study by the Group 
of International Communists reveals in its structure such a strongly integrated 
unity of content that it is possible to speak here of a really positive 
collective effort. The adoption of the collective method of work in drafting the 
text, which proves in practice what results can be achieved by a consciously 
motivated group, is just one of it's qualities which is of such great and 
enduring value.</p>

<p class="fst">With this work the Group of International Communists have put 
forward for debate, for the first time in the post-war history of the working 
class movement, the practical possibility of ordering social production and 
distribution on the basis of a use-value economy. They have brought together all 
the experience accumulated as a result of earlier attempts, by theoretical 
representatives of the working class of a previous era, to solve this most 
ultimate and conclusive of all areas of the revolutionary theory of the 
proletariat, in order that the root causes which in the final outcome render all 
those earlier efforts scientifically untenable may be laid bare and so prevented 
from generating further confusion.</p>

<p class="fst">On the other hand, taking as it's starting-point the established 
principles of scientific communism and combining these with such of the work of 
previous authors as has been to any degree positive, the work simultaneously 
reveals new social relations and economic interconnections which in their 
totality establish the economics of communism upon a firm scientific foundation. 
It concerns itself not only with the necessity for economic transformation and 
construction in the sphere of industry, but also reveals the necessary links 
with the agricultural economy. In this way the authors provide a clear insight 
into the internal interconnections and the law-given mode of development 
characteristic of the entire economic organism of the growing communist society.</p>

<p class="fst">The simple language and the clear methods of analysis employed, 
which are understandable to every class-conscious worker, ensure that every 
revolutionary who diligently studies the following pages can also fully grasp 
their content. The clarity and disciplined objectivity of the writing likewise 
open up the possibility of a broad arena of discussion within the working class 
movement, one which can draw into its orbit all the varied schools of opinion 
represented within its ranks. Since we Council Communists also, within our own 
ranks, must subject the possibilities projected here to the most thoroughgoing 
discussion, we reserve for a latter date the final expression of our standpoint 
towards the exposition which follows.</p>

<p class="fst">There is one wish, however, which we would like to extend to this 
text to help it on its way: the work Fundamental Principles of Communist 
Production and Distribution will have proved it's success finally and for all 
time when all revolutionary workers have consciously read through its pages and 
brought the accumulated experience contained therein into practical application 
in the struggle for the victory of the proletarian cause, the victory of 
communism! The struggle is hard, but the final goal is worthy of it!</p>
