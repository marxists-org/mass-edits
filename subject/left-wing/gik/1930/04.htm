<h4>CHAPTER 4</h4>
<h1><a name="h0">Average Social Production Time as the Basis of Production</a></h1>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">1. Kautsky's Definition</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Leichter's text has served a particularly useful purpose in that 
it has been instrumental in carrying out an examination which demonstrates that 
the average social Labour-Hour can under communism be thoroughly and 
consistently implemented as a unit of social regulation and accounting control, 
even in cases in which the labour-hours actually expended are not taken as the 
basis for distribution. At least in respect of the question of the unit of 
social regulation and accounting control to be adopted, he shows himself to be 
far in advance of his colleagues, the 'Marxist' economic experts, Neurath and 
Kautsky. In his book <i>La Theorie Marxiste de le Monnaie</i>,<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> Block, as a 
bourgeois economist, characterises the attempt to abolish money under communism 
as naive, and comes to the conclusion that a more thorough examination of the 
theory of social regulation and accounting control according to labour-time 
expended would be superfluous (page 215). Kautsky, on the other hand, considers 
labour-time accounting control as possible in theory, but impossible to 
implement in practice, since money cannot be dispensed with "as a measure of 
value in maintaining accounting control of exchange relationships in a socialist 
society", whilst simultaneously it must "continue to function as a means of 
circulation".<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> Kautsky, who up till now has presented the capitalist 
conception of value as "an historical category" (that is to say, one which must 
disappear along with capitalism),<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> has been thrown into such a state of 
confusion through Weber's bourgeois criticism and the practice of the Russian 
revolution that he now swings to the opinion that the value concept must be 
enshrined for all eternity!</p>

<p class="fst">The effect wrought upon Kautsky by the criticism of communism, 
particularly that it necessitates the introduction of a unit of regulation and 
accounting control, was that of luring him out of his theoretical hiding-place; 
it was now impossible for him to remain attached to the old general formula 
which states that 'value' disappears along with capitalism, and was now 
compelled to seek the truth as he saw it. In actual truth, a unit of regulation 
and accounting control did show itself to be necessary. And if Marx had 
maintained that, in the case of a communist economy, "it is at first money 
capital which is eliminated", then it becomes necessary to subject to a closer 
examination the concept of the unit of accounting control, which Engels in 
Anti-Dühring and Marx in Capital and the Marginal Notes (Critique of the Gotha 
Programme) had shown to be the average social hour of labour. We now know to 
what result his researches led, and it will now prove worth our while to unravel 
the source from which Kautsky's idea that a system of regulation and accounting 
control is a practical impossibility actually derives.</p>

<p class="fst">We have already indicated that the conception of the development 
towards communism which was then widely current was that capitalism would dig 
its own grave by virtue of its inherent tendency towards concentration. 
Hilferding examined the consequences of a total concentration of economic 
establishments on the basis of the assumption that the entire economy would be 
organised in one single giant trust, a general cartel. Within this imaginary 
cartel there is no market, no money and no prices. The economy without money 
would have been realised.</p>

<p class="fst">Within this trust, production would have become a closed system. 
In the course of their transformation from natural materials to the finished 
product, the products move through the most varied industrial installations. For 
instance, coal and iron ore make their way to the smelting ovens, (and as their 
product), iron and steel move to the engineering works, this then provides 
machinery to the textile factories, where finally the textile commodities appear 
as the end product. In the course of their movement from one economic 
installation to another, thousands and tens of thousands of workers from all 
possible branches of industry have played their role in fashioning the products, 
in order finally to create the end product. <i>Exactly how much labour does this 
final product contain?</i> It is thus that Kautsky's famous puzzle is formulated 
and, in the face of such a super-human task, he sadly buries his head in his 
hands. Yes, in theory there must be a solution to the problem. But, in practice? 
No, it is impossible "to calculate for each product the total amount of labour 
which represents its costs, from its first beginnings right up to the final 
finishing operations."<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> "An evaluation of commodities according to the labour 
(sic) contained in them is, even assuming the most colossal and technically 
perfect statistical apparatus", quite impossible (K. Kautsky: ibid., page 
321).<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Yes, indeed, Kautsky is completely justified in saying that by <i>
this</i> method a computation of labour-time expended in the production of 
commodities is quite impossible!</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">2. Leichter's Definition</a></h3>

<p class="fst">However, such a mode of production exists only in Kautsky's 
fantasy or in that of the 'natural economists', who would like to see the 
economy managed by a central authority. In addition, they conceive the monstrous 
idea that each separate factory, the parts of the whole, would not have 
responsibility for maintaining exact accounting control over the process of 
production in their factory! The parts of the trust, however, produce as if they 
were to some extent independent, for the simple reason that otherwise planned 
production would prove impossible. Indeed, even in the interests of securing 
rational operation, this is now more than obligatory. It is for this reason that 
as exact a method of accounting on the basis of a unit of social regulation and 
accounting control as can be achieved is an absolute necessity for moneyless 
exchange within a single trust:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"There exist relations between the separate production 
installations, and these relations will remain for so long as the division of 
labour exists, and the division of labour in this higher sense will continue to 
develop further with the progress made in the development of technique."<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">"All impersonal prerequisites for production, all half-finished 
materials, all raw materials and auxiliary materials delivered by other 
productive establishments to those destined to work them up further, will indeed 
be placed to their account, i.e., will be factorised."<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">"The cartel magnates or - in a socialist economy - the managers 
of the entire economy, will not permit the various industrial establishments 
responsible for the same production programme to produce according to different 
methods and different costs. Under capitalism, this in many cases also forms an 
incentive for the weaker concerns to permit themselves to be "swallowed" 
willy-nilly by some giant agglomerate, in the hope that now for their factory 
also the form of organisation recognised to be the most efficient - the best 
manufacturing methods, the most diligent officials - will be drawn into the task 
of raising the productivity of the factory. For this to be a success, it will 
however be necessary to show under separate headings the results of all other 
factories and productive installations, and also to manage matters - whether in 
a capitalist or in a socialist economy is irrelevant - as if each factory had 
its own independent proprietor who wished to have at his disposal exact data 
concerning the economic results of production in his establishment. For this 
reason extremely strict accounting control is maintained within the cartel, and 
any idea that within the cartel commodities may be embezzled without further 
account being taken - in short, that within the separate industrial 
installations the keeping of a clear account as to the distinction between 
'mine' and 'thine' will not prevail - belongs in fact to the world of popular 
misconceptions concerning capitalism, as indeed of socialism also."<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Seen from this point of view, the alleged impossibility of 
calculating the amount of labour which lies embedded in a particular product 
appears in a different light. To determine that which Kautsky, from his central 
economic headquarters, cannot determine, namely, how much realised labour-time a 
product has absorbed during its long journey from one partial operation to 
another in the course of the production process - <i>that task</i>, <i>the 
producers themselves can now be seen to be fully capable of performing</i>. The 
secret lies in the fact that each factory, managed and administered by its 
"factory organisation", functions as an independent unit, exactly as in 
capitalism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"At a first glance, one would assume that each separate 
productive establishment were more or less independent, but upon making a closer 
examination one would see quite clearly the umbilical cord joining the 
individual factory to the rest of the economy and to its administration."<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the chain of partial processes, each factory has its final 
product, which can then be introduced into other factories as means of 
production. And, furthermore, each individual factory is perfectly capable of 
calculating the average labour-time used up in producing its products by 
application of its production formula (p + c) + L. In the example of the shoe 
factory mentioned above, 3.125 Labour-Hours were found to be the "unit cost" of 
a pair of shoes. The result of such a unit calculation for an individual factory 
is a factory average, which expresses how many Labour-Hours are contained in a 
pair of shoes, a tonne of coal or a cubic metre of gas, etc.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">3. Some Comparative Evaluations</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Thus the production factors are seen to be fully accurate (with 
the exception of possible false estimations in the early period of communism). 
The final product of a factory, assuming it is not a consumption article, moves 
on to the next factory, where it serves as means of production ( p or c ). This 
establishment, of course, likewise controls its production by means of applying 
the same unit of regulation and accounting control. In this way each factory 
obtains a completely accurate method of accounting control over its final 
product. The fact that this procedure is valid for not only industrial 
installations which produce a mass product, but is also applicable to the most 
varied products of a complex productive organism, soon becomes generally 
excepted, especially since this particular branch of the "science of cost 
accounting" is already so highly developed. The labour-time taken up by the last 
finished product is in reality nothing other than the average labour-time 
contributed by the last factory in the chain which, by application of the 
standard formula ( p + c ) + L, simultaneously takes up and includes in its 
computation the total sum of all the separate labour-times attributable to each 
participating establishment, from the beginning of the production chain to the 
finished product. The computation of this final total is built up out of all the 
partial processes and lies fully in the hands of the producers.</p>

<p class="fst">Kautsky indeed recognises very well the necessity for calculating 
the average social labour-time of the products, but he conceives of no 
possibility of realising this conception completely and in practice. No wonder 
that he is unable to make the slightest sense out of any of the various problems 
associated with this category! For instance, he already runs aground when he 
tries to consider the question of variations in productivity between individual 
factories, and, of course, the problem of the determination of the 'price' for 
each product. Although it may seem superfluous for us to concern ourselves 
further with these objections - since we have already uncovered Kautsky's 
principal errors - we may nevertheless find it expedient to follow his views 
further, since this may assist us in achieving by negative example a more 
concrete formulation of the category of average social labour-time.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us begin with the concept of 'prices' of products. The point 
must be made at the outset that Kautsky speaks quite unreservedly about the 
'prices' of products as if these still have validity under communism. He is of 
course entitled to keep faith with his own terminology since, as we have seen, 
'prices' continue to function in the Kautskyian brand of 'communism'. In the 
same way as, for this 'Marxist', the category of value is attributed with 
everlasting life and just as, under his 'communism' money also continues to 
function, in the same way prices also are assured an eternal life. But what kind 
of communism is it in which the same economic categories continue to have 
validity as exist under capitalism? Marx and Engels at least refused to have 
anything to do with this brand of 'communist' economy. We have already shown 
how, according to them, value and price are eliminated and subsumed in the 
category of <i>average social labour-time</i>. It is for this reason that the 
producers calculate "how much labour each useful article requires for its 
production". (F. Engels: Anti-Dühring). Kautsky pronounces this calculation to 
be impossible. In order to give substance to this judgement, he directs our 
attention to the fact that not all factories would be equally productive, with 
the labour-time actually expended being in one case, above, in another, below 
the social average - so leading to chaos in prices. He says in this connection:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"And what quantity of labour should one actually take into 
account? Certainly not that which each product has actually cost. If this be 
done, the various articles of the same kind from different establishments would 
throw up differing prices, those produced under less favourable conditions being 
higher than those of others. That would of course be absurd. It would be 
necessary for them all to have the same price, and this would be calculated not 
according to the labour actually expended, but on the basis of the average 
social labour. (Sic - trans.) Would it in fact prove possible to determine this 
for each separate product?"<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Here Kautsky demands with justice that the "prices" of products 
must agree with the socially necessary labour and not with the labour<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> which 
has actually been expended upon that product in that particular factory, since, 
(not all factories being equally productive), the labour-time actually expended 
will in one case lie above and in another case below the social average for that 
industrial group. The solution to the problem resides, of course, in a procedure 
in which the producers themselves, by means of their own factory organisations, 
calculate the average social labour-time, and <i>not</i> Kautsky. That which his 
economic headquarters is not capable of achieving, <i>the factory organisations 
themselves</i>, <i>the Workers' Councils</i>, <i>are perfectly capable of 
realising</i>, <i>in this way simultaneously imparting to the category of 
average social labour-time its concrete form</i>.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">4. The Mode of Operation of the Formula (P + C) + L</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The fact that the individual productive establishments have 
determined the average labour-time necessary for their product does not mean 
that the Marxist concept of a social average has been attained. To achieve this, 
all productive establishments operating in the same sector of production must 
enter into cooperation with one another. In our example, for instance, all shoe 
factories must determine the total average out of all the various individual 
factory averages. Where one factory arrives at an average of 3 hours per pair of 
shoes, another at 3.25 hours and yet another at 3.5, then the average 
labour-time would lie at 3.25. (This is, of course, only an approximation; for 
the accurate formulation, see Chapter 9 of this work).</p>

<p class="fst">Thus we can see that the need to calculate the average social 
labour-time is already leading to a horizontal coordination of productive 
establishments. This however is not being carried out by a bureaucratic 
apparatus controlled by the state, but grows out of the factories themselves 
from below. The whys and wherefores of the system are completely clear and 
understandable for every worker, whilst at the same time the necessity for open 
book-keeping brings everything under public control.</p> 

<p class="fst">The fact that the individual productive establishments arrive at 
a differing average is an expression of their differing productivity's, which 
would have its cause in, in the one case a more efficient, in the other a less 
efficient operation of either the objective means of production or of the living 
labour making up the production system of each separate factory. In the 
meantime, our "shoe cartel" calculates for all footwear factories in combination 
3.25 hours as their average labour-time, which then becomes the cipher against 
which shoes enter into individual consumption. A factory which is unproductive, 
that is to say which operates below the average level of productivity and which 
therefore, in spite of its best efforts, cannot produce a pair of shoes in less 
than, say, 3.5 hours, must of necessity operate at a loss. It is unable to 
reproduce at the socially adequate average rate its ( p + c ) + L for the next 
production period. As against this, there will be other factories which are 
overproductive, which operate over the average level of productivity. Taking 
once again our example, these can produce a pair of shoes in 3 hours. As their 
product enters into general social consumption, they are able to reproduce their 
( p + c ) + L and show additionally a plus increment. Since the social average 
has been calculated from the averages of all the individual productive 
establishments, the losses and the surpluses within a cartel must cancel each 
other out.</p>

<p class="fst">What we see here, therefore, is a system of regulation within the 
production group, and indeed one which has been brought into operation by the 
productive establishments themselves. It is not a mode of regulation which 
depends upon "mutual aid" but, on the contrary, is an exact method of 
calculation. The productivity of a particular productive establishment can be 
determined accurately, and by this act the limits are exactly fixed within which 
the losses and surpluses must lie. Productivity thus becomes an exact factor and 
can be expressed in a single cipher, the <i>Productivity Factor</i>. This factor 
defines accurately just how large or small the plus or minus figures of a given 
productive establishment will be.</p>

<p class="fst">Although it is not possible to provide a general formula on the 
basis of which computations within a particular 'cartel' must proceed, since 
this will necessarily vary with the type and size of the productive 
establishments comprising of it, we are nevertheless concerned here with an 
exact quantity. Productivity is determined not only by the quantity of the 
manufactured product, but is also determined by the relation between the 
quantity of product produced and the degree to which ( p + c ) + L has been used 
up in its production. In cases in which a particular productive establishment is 
under-productive, this means that its ( p + c ) + L has been assessed at too 
high a value in relation to the quantity of product produced. Put the other way 
round, ( p + c ) + L has too low an intrinsic or actual value, and the degree to 
which that value lies below the average is measured by the extent of the 
deviation from the social average. In our example, our shoe factory computes a 
factory average of 3½ hours for a pair of shoes, whilst the social average lies 
at 3¼ hours. In this case, the actual productivity realised stands in inverse 
relation to the required level, which means that the level of productivity of 
this particular factory lies in a ratio of 3¼ to 3½ equivalent to 13:14. The 
factory calculation must therefore always make itself correspond with the social 
average by application of the formula 13/14ths of ( p + c ) + L, and it is this 
which must always be applied when calculating its production time for so long as 
its production remains at that level. Thus the increment which the "cartel" 
always restores is 1/14th of ( p + c ) + L.</p>

<p class="fst">It should be understood, of course, that all this is only by way 
of example. Since the entire production accounting control stands on the firm 
ground of labour-time computation, many roads can lead to the same end. What is 
of fundamental significance is that administration and management always remain 
in the hands of the producers themselves, whilst each industrial establishment 
retains full control over its means of reproduction.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus the distinction between average social labour-time and the 
individual factory or works average does actually exist, but is equalised and 
eliminated through the "production cartel" or "guild", or whatever term one may 
wish to apply to the grouped industrial establishments of a particular 
industrial sector in combination. The elimination of this distinction also 
destroys another argument used by Kautsky against the method of labour-time 
regulation and accounting control. Following immediately upon his 
above-mentioned statements of view, he continues:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Would it in fact prove possible to determine this (the socially 
necessary labour-time - the Authors) for each separate product?" (K. Kautsky: 
ibid., p. 319)</p>

<p class="quoteb">" We would in such a case obtain a double answer. The 
remuneration of the workers would need to take place on the basis of the 
labour-time actually expended. The prices of the products, on the other hand, 
would need to reflect the socially necessary labour<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> required for their 
production. The total of the labour-hours socially expended would need to be the 
same from one computation to the next. But that would almost never be the case." 
(K. Kautsky: ibid., p. 319)</p>

<p class="fst">Would it be possible to determine the average social labour-time 
for each product, asks Kautsky? Our unhesitating reply is: Yes! - since each 
industrial establishment and each sector of production is fully able to apply 
the production formula ( p + c ) + L. Kautsky is unable to make anything of 
this, because he lacks any tangible or concrete conception of the term average 
social labour-time, and this again has its basic cause in the fact that he 
perceives all problems purely from the point of view of the central 
administration. The average social labour-time is calculated from the combined 
productivities of all the member industrial establishments. From this it is 
possible to see at a glance to what extent each has deviated from the social 
norm of productivity. In other words, its Productivity Factor is established. 
Even though the individual industrial units may deviate from the social average 
in their individual factory accounting, these deviations are exactly known and 
their aggregate total is equal to nil. Throughout the production group, as a 
whole, production takes place according to the formula ( P + C ) + L, which is 
equivalent to the average social labour-time.</p>

<p class="fst">According to Kautsky, however, even the development of technique 
becomes a hindrance standing in the way of regulation and accounting control on 
the basis of labour-time. After having declared it to be an impossibility "to 
calculate for each product the amount of labour which it has cost from its first 
beginnings right through to the final finishing processes", he proceeds further: 
"And should one ever complete the task, one would have to begin all over again, 
since in the meantime the level of technology would have changed in many 
sectors".</p>

<p class="fst">Now isn't that a shame! After Kautsky, looking down from his 
command post on high, where all the various lines of production come together, 
has exactly observed all the various partial processes, he finally completes a 
mammoth calculation which really does reveal exactly how much labour-time is 
contained in the final social product. At last that's done, thank goodness! And 
then along comes this devil called technology and throws all his endless 
calculations into confusion! What a nonsensical conception of production some 
people have! Production in the real world is such that industrial establishment 
has an end product which already bears within it the measure of labour-time. 
When an advance takes place of technology, or its productivity increases for any 
other reason, the average social labour-time required for this partial process 
falls. Should the product in question happen to be a final product destined for 
individual consumption, then it moves into the sphere of consumption with a 
reduced average, and therewith the matter is concluded. However, should it move 
on into the sphere of other industrial establishments and enter into their 
production budgets as means of production, then for the relevant factory the 
rate of which ( p + c ) is used up falls, that is to say, the costs to this 
factory are reduced, and as a consequence the average social labour-time 
embodied in its product also falls. The variations which are caused thereby 
within the production group ("cartel") are compensated by revising the 
Productivity Factor.</p>

<p class="fst">The Kautskyian objections to the method of labour-time 
computation all have their basis in the fact that he can conceive of no possible 
way in which the concept of average social labour-time can be given a concrete 
form. This concrete form it receives, however, only when management and 
administration of production lie in the hands of the producers themselves and 
are implemented through <i>the Association of Free and Equal Producers</i>.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>It was out of the very practice of the revolutionary class 
struggle itself</i>, <i>which created the system of Workers' Councils as its 
instrument</i>, <i>that simultaneously the concept of average social labour-time 
as a concrete formulation was born</i>.</p>
