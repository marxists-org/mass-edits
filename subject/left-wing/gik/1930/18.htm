<h4>CHAPTER 18</h4>
<h1><a name="h0">The Peasants and the Workers' Councils</a></h1>

<p class="fst">The proletarian revolution, which conceives of the establishment 
of communism not as nationalisation of the "mature" industrial establishments, 
but as the carrying through in practice of a principle according to which <i>all 
producers themselves take measures under their own initiative to integrate their 
labour with the communist system of production</i>, thereby simultaneously 
provides the basis for the incorporation of the whole of agriculture as a 
specific section of total production into the communist economic system. The 
single unifying principle underlying and making possible this economic 
integration resides in the creation and consolidation of <i>a unit of economic 
regulation and control</i> which registers the flow of products continually in 
motion within society. Such a unit is achieved through the determination of <i>
the average social reproduction time</i> required by each product. Through the 
instrumentality of this system, <i>each productive establishment becomes an 
active cell in the growth of communism</i>, a cell in which the autonomous 
initiatives and self-activity of the proletariat can unfold and develop.</p>

<p class="fst">Once the power of the industrial proletariat has been irrevocably 
anchored in the Council system, than it cannot proceed in any other way than to 
extend the same organisational principle to the sphere of agriculture. In every 
economic system, production is operationally dependent upon the organisational 
integrity of the structure within which it moves and develops; however, exactly 
what form the Council system would assume in its application to agrarian 
production is another question which only the future can answer. Even though the 
general principles through which the Council system operates are the same for 
agriculture as for industry, there are nevertheless many particular situations 
which would dictate that this general system in particular cases assumes many 
different and varied forms. Practice itself would, for instance, almost 
certainly bring to light the fact that proletarian consciousness would be much 
more fully and powerfully developed in the case of industrial workers than in 
that of the agricultural proletariat, whilst a further cause for a differing 
mode of application of the Council principle would lie in the different natural 
conditions of production prevailing between industry and agriculture.</p>

<p class="fst">However this may be, the decisive factor will be the cooperative 
organisation of the peasants into village communes, which in the last analysis 
will be nothing other than the outcome of combining together the productive 
organisations at present existing in the form of the various individual 
farmsteads. Of their own initiative, however, the peasants will not achieve 
this, so that, in addition to a very persuasive propaganda campaign, the 
economic control of the proletariat must ensure measures which guarantee such a 
development. These measures would ensure that such essential supplies such as 
agricultural implements, seed, artificial fertilisers, petroleum, etc., would be 
supplied only to those agricultural organisations which had taken the decisive 
step of combining into village communes. The firmer the industrial proletariat 
holds power, the more certain will be the eventual carrying through of 
autonomous organisation within the peasantry.</p>

<p class="fst">The peasants, then, have the responsibility, like the industrial 
workers, of computing, by application of the formula (p + c) + L, the Average 
Social Reproduction Time of their products. It is the capitalist system, which 
was responsible in the first place for transforming the peasants into commodity 
producers, which we must thank for the fact that this task is one eminently 
capable of fulfilment. The practicality of applying such a method of computation 
is, for instance, clearly demonstrated through the fact that, today, modern 
methods of cost accounting find as frequent application in agriculture as they 
do in industry (see J.S. King: <i>Cost Accounting Applied in Agriculture</i>).</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, the fact remains that, in this matter, we are 
standing at the very threshold of a long development. When one considers, 
however, that this young science began life only in 1922, then one sees that it 
is a cause for amazement to observe how rapidly such general principles, valid 
in both the industrial and agricultural spheres of production, have established 
themselves. What this proves above all else is that, in reality, the fundamental 
character of the two production spheres is the same, and that agricultural 
production has long since made the transition to industry. It is true that the 
weight of tradition still makes itself felt here as an inhibiting factor, but 
the disadvantageous financial situation prevailing in agriculture throughout 
most of Western Europe will undermine this influence very rapidly. Whoever comes 
into close contact with the peasants will know that in their case many of the 
old "truths" are rapidly being exposed as fantasy and new ones are being 
continually born in their place. Of course, this does not bear any relation to 
communist production, but it does find application in such measures as 
rationalisation, modern industrial management and the formation of cooperatives. 
As far as the communist mode of production is concerned, the significance of 
this lies in the fact that the objective conditions for a many-sided 
implementation of the system of average social reproduction time are developing 
very quickly.</p>

<p class="fst">There remains of course always an appreciable difference between 
industrial and agrarian production. In the main, these are due to the differing 
natural production conditions. For instance, the incidence of rainfall or 
drought, plant or animal diseases and so on,, play a role in agriculture, so 
that the productivity of agricultural establishments cannot be so exactly 
forecast and estimated as is possible in industry. Nevertheless, comparisons of 
productivity between the separate establishments are perfectly accountable (see 
again J.S. King: <i>Cost Accounting Applied in Agriculture</i>), and such 
comparisons are made even today. This indeed, has already become the acid test 
for rationalisation in farm establishments. As regards the question of methods 
for determining the various average social reproduction times, it is not our 
task to conjure up out of the tops of our heads methods which would explain how 
this task could be achieved in each separate case. One thing however is clear: 
the realisation of this category will lead to a complete reorganisation of the 
whole of the agricultural economy. In addition, a factor which will be seen as a 
natural necessity will be that the reproduction period, instead of extending 
over a period of production, will encompass as long a time-span as, for 
instance, as 10 years. It is the capriciousness of natural phenomena and the 
conditions this imposes which make this necessary, since the variations and 
fluctuations arising from such unpredictable factors are more readily averaged 
out over a longer period of time; in this way, when drawing up computations of 
Average Social Reproduction Time, it will be necessary to overcome those 
fluctuations in production which unavoidably result from such changes in natural 
conditions. There would then remain only that spontaneous fall in average social 
reproduction times resulting from a progressively rising productivity.</p>
