<h4>CHAPTER 6</h4>
<h1><a name="h0">General Social Labour</a></h1>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">1. The GSU Establishments</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Up to this point we have considered only such industrial 
establishments which supply, through their productive activity, a tangible or 
measurable product. However, we have already made reference to the fact that in 
certain establishments no material or physical product is created, whilst at the 
same time they remain indispensable for social life. We mentioned in this 
connection the economic and political councils, the education system, the health 
service, etc. - in general, institutions concerned with cultural and social 
needs. They produce no tangible product. The result of their activities is that 
their services are absorbed directly into society, and in their case, therefore, 
production and distribution are carried out simultaneously. A further 
characteristic feature of these establishment is that, in a communist society, 
they supply their services "free of charge". They stand freely at the disposal 
of all to the extent that they are needed. With this type of establishment the 
principle "supply according to need" is realised; distribution takes place 
without economic measure. This type we will name ESTABLISHMENTS FOR GENERAL 
SOCIAL USE (GSU ESTABLISHMENTS) or simply PUBLIC ESTABLISHMENTS. This is in 
contradistinction to those establishments which do not produce without 
compensation and which are here named PRODUCTIVE ESTABLISHMENTS.</p>

<p class="fst">It should be clear that this difference in economic function 
introduces complications into the communist system of economic regulation and 
control. Were all establishments to produce a tangible product, one would need 
to say relatively little about communist production. It would only be necessary 
to organise a correct distribution to the productive establishments in respect 
of P, C and L, and production would be able to move smoothly forward, whilst 
each individual worker could receive "the full proceeds of the individual's 
labour-power", paid in labour certificates at the factory. Labour-time then 
becomes a direct measure for that part of the social product which is destined 
for individual consumption.</p>

<p class="fst">This, however, does not reflect the realities of the system. 
Although the GSU (public) establishments consume means of production, raw 
materials and also consumption goods for the workers who work in them, they 
contribute no new product to the total mass of products at the disposal of 
society. All those use-values which the GSU (public) establishments consume must 
therefore be deducted from the mass of products produced by the productive 
establishments; that is to say, the workers do <i>not</i> receive the "full 
proceeds of their labour" paid out at the productive establishments, and that 
labour-time is not the <i>direct</i> measure determining the part of the social 
product which is destined for individual consumption, inasmuch as the workers 
must surrender a part of their product for, amongst other categories, the public 
(GSU) establishments. This makes it appear as if, in this case, the exact 
relationship of the producers to the social product had been disturbed, and it 
is indeed here that the source of the difficulty may be found which has caused 
the economists so many headaches.</p>

<p class="fst">It is now our task to find a final solution to this problem. For 
all economists concerned with the economic system of communism, this question is 
a sensitive point. It was, furthermore, from the attempt to solve this anomaly 
that, amongst other things, Neurath's project for a central authority for 
producers and distributors first arose, in that it is this central authority 
which decides what and how much out of the total social product each individual 
shall enjoy according to "the way of life to which he is accustomed". Others are 
not quite consistent in their treatment of the problem and attempt to solve it 
by means of indirect taxes (Russia). But in all these cases the answer to the 
questions to exactly what and how much should be allocated to the individual 
worker-producer for individual consumption represents just so much fumbling 
around in the dark. On one question, however, there is unanimity: in order to 
solve the problem a central management and administration of the economy is 
necessary, which then means that there can be no question of establishing an 
exact relationship of the producer to the product. The fact that "libertarian 
communism" a la Sebastian Faure is also compelled to grasp at the straw offered 
to him by an economy administered "from above" means that in this system also 
the basic motivation may be imputed to the same cause.</p>

<p class="fst">Since it can be demonstrated from this <i>that the most 
significant roots of State communism lie embedded in attempts to solve this 
problem</i>, it is imperative that we devote especial attention to it. It was 
indeed only after the onset of the revolutionary period 1917-23 that a solution 
first became possible, when the marxist principle - as, indeed, the Bakuninist 
also - that "not the state but the union of free associations of the communist 
society" represents the positive principle in the construction of communism, 
crystallised into its first concrete form in the system of Workers' Councils.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">2. Leichter's Price Policy</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The first to have brought this problem closer to its solution was 
Otto Leichter, for the simple reason that he was the first to have placed the 
communist economy upon the material foundation of "cost accounting". 
Nevertheless his work did not reach a satisfactory conclusion, because in the 
final outcome he did not know how to apply consistently the category of average 
social labour-time to both production and distribution. Leichter's conception of 
the whole economy is that of a giant trust, Hilferding's "universal cartel". For 
him the question then resolved itself into that of deciding wherein the source 
from which he might derive the general public accounts (what we have termed the 
GSU services) might lie. He turned his face against the method of indirect taxes 
and sought other means. He even found them ... but, in doing so, he let fall the 
category of average social labour-time. When Kautsky failed, having placed 
himself in an anomalous situation through being unable to perceive the 
difference between the factory average and the social average, Leichter also 
failed to solve this same problem. But, in his case, he did not permit this to 
lure him away from the method of labour-time computation completely. Instead of 
calculating the social average for the entire "guild" or sector of production, 
he determined a "price" for each product according to the productivity of the 
least efficient (or most expensive) establishments, thus compelling the 
remaining industrial establishments to operate at a profit, which profit then 
flows into the general treasury of the whole of society. Concerning these 
profit-making installations he writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"These will then throw up a differential plus amount, or - 
expressed in capitalist terms - a surplus profit which, of course, should not be 
left to accrue to this or that individual factory alone but - once again 
expressed in capitalist terms - must be eliminated through taxation."<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Although Leichter finds that it is most frequently convenient to 
apply a method of control over the stream of products according to "the socially 
necessary labour-time therein specifically expended" (page 38), he does not, as 
we have already noted, carry this through to its logical conclusion. Above all, 
he does not recognise the crucial role played by the category of <i>average</i> 
social labour-time. As we shall see, he attempts to compensate for this later, 
but nevertheless he has in this way drawn the first veil of confusion and 
obscurity over his analysis.</p>

<p class="fst">... In the meantime, this "source of income" is found to be an 
inadequate device and, to be quite blunt, not fundamentally essential to 
Leichter's system. In the course of his later examination of the problem, he 
attempts to formulate it more exactly and in doing so achieves a fundamental 
advance over and against all other work in this field of which we know. The 
first step in his scheme is to combine all public costs under one heading and 
then to determine how many labour-hours per year have been expended by all 
producers to achieve this (it is obvious that this requires a general system of 
social book-keeping). In this way he obtains two values which, when brought into 
relation with one another, produce a difference-amount. Since the entire 
calculation rests upon the computation of labour-time, he has by this means 
uncovered an integer which indicates how many labour-hours must be contributed 
per head of population on account of GSU or public works. And thus he has also 
uncovered how much of the labour-power directly expended in the productive 
establishments must be added to the prices of products in order to cover the 
"costs" of these GSU (public) social expenditures:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Each productive establishment will thus have responsibility, 
each year when the overall production budget for society as a whole is drawn up, 
for introducing into its specific works or factory budget a category relating to 
the entire social production system (p. 65). The total sum thus arrived at for 
all the various economic headings - which then become, of course, a charge upon 
the entire production system - is then aggregated to form some final amount, 
presumably one related to the total number of labour-hours performed in the 
spheres of both production and distribution. The difference-amount thus arrived 
at is then added to the sums paid out for individual remuneration of labour 
("wages") when the origination costs of all social ("public") expenditures are 
summated, so that an element representing the general costs of society is 
included in the costs of goods. It would, of course be equivalent to an 
injustice, and would have almost the same effect as an indirect tax, were one to 
add the same increment for general social costs to all commodities, to the most 
staple as to the most luxurious, to the most necessary as to the most esoteric. 
Amongst the important tasks of the Economic Parliament or Supreme Economic 
Administration will therefore be that of determining for each branch of industry 
or for each individual product the correct increment category to be applied for 
general social costs, always fixing these in such a way that the total 
non-productive costs of society are included. In this way the possibility is 
also obtained of influencing price policy in accordance with the viewpoint of a 
central authority ..." (O. Leichter: ibid.; p. 66)</p>

<p class="fst">This conception of Leichter's is remarkable indeed. In order to 
avoid the accusation of adopting the method of indirect taxes, he proposes that 
the costs of education, the health service, distribution, etc. <i>not</i> be 
borne equally by all members of society. It is apparently his intention that a 
comparatively heavier burden should be borne by those with larger incomes, as 
compared with those "poorer" workers whom the statisticians and subsistence 
physiologists consider should be advantaged. We, however, must openly declare 
our view; namely, that such measures would, by precisely these means, acquire 
the character of indirect taxation. What we are considering here is precisely 
the category of those costs needed to maintain the GSU establishments. Why 
should it be considered necessary that the "rich" should contribute more in this 
respect than the "subsistence workers" whose needs have been assessed according 
to so-called "scientific" sociological methods based on the statistical art? 
Could it be the case here that it is Leichter's guilty conscience which here 
speaks up on behalf of an antagonistic mode of distribution of the social 
product?</p>

<p class="fst">Let us however now delete from his analyses everything which is 
in any way superfluous and pose concretely the question: how does Leichter 
arrive at his figure for general social costs? We then see that there can only 
be one answer: On the one hand from the surplus produced by the productive 
establishments and on the other hand from indirect taxes. Indeed, he evokes the 
appearance of wishing to add a specific increment to the prices of all products, 
but in practice his solution resolves itself into one in which the specific 
amount is fixed "for each sector of industry or for each product". Precisely 
which products those are to be <i>can be determined only through the 
antagonistic power-relations underlying the Leichterian class society</i>. And 
this, in its turn, can be determined only by the degree of force which the 
workers are able to bring to bear in their struggle against "their" supreme 
administration. It is for this reason that we arrive at the conclusion that 
Leichter is unable to solve the problem. His "exact relationship" finds its 
practical end in total bankruptcy.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">3. The Distribution of the Product</a></h3>

<p class="fst">It was, however, quite unnecessary, even in a situation in which 
such a solution by means of an antagonistic mode of distribution of the product 
is posed, to take this road of indirect taxes and a price policy. In the main, 
the problem was correctly formulated in the first place. The general social 
costs can only be borne by the directly expended labour-power. This becomes 
immediately apparent if we take, so to speak, an aerial view of the entire 
economic process in all its simplicity. Reduced to its most simple terms, this 
may be formulated as follows:</p>

<p class="fst"><i><b>Society in its productive activity turns out products in 
thousandfold form. These products have stamped upon them how many hours of 
average social labour-time have been used up in their production. Out of this 
mass of products it is the productive installations which first of all renew 
their used up means of production and raw materials. Next it is the GSU (public) 
installations which carry through the same process. Finally, the remaining 
products are consumed by all workers. With this, the entire social product has 
been consumed by society.</b></i></p>

<p class="fst">At the first stage, therefore, the <i>productive establishments</i> 
take out of the product mass what they have used up in p and c. This means 
nothing more than, that all installations, each one taken separately, which have 
calculated the quantities of p and c they have used up and which have adopted 
these into the cost computations of their products, now also renew all those 
products in exactly those quantities determined by the relevant cost 
computation. If we set down once again the production schematic for the total of 
all productive installations, taken together, we have:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">(P + C) + L = Mass of Products<br>
100 million + 600 million + 600 million = 1300 million Labour-Hours</p>

<p class="fst">In this case all these installations taken together would have 
consumed a total of 700 million labour-hours (for P and C). These are 
accordingly withdrawn from the total social product, so that a mass of product 
remains which embodies 600 million labour-hours.</p>

<p class="fst">From this remaining mass of products the GSU (public) 
establishments now take out what is required for the renewal of their means of 
production and raw materials. What then remains is available for individual 
consumption.</p>

<p class="fst">In order to formulate this mode of distribution concretely, it is 
necessary that the total consumption of the GSU (public) establishments be a 
known quantity. If we term the means of production required for these 
installations Pu, the raw materials Cu and the labour Lu (the index u stands for 
"universal", i.e. public) then we can formulate the total budget for all GSU 
establishments as follows:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">(Pu + Cu) + Lu = Social Services, or<br>
8 million + 50 million + 50 million = 108 million Labour-Hours</p>

<p class="fst">By this means we have made a further advance. From the 600 
million labour-hours of product accountable to the productive establishments, 58 
million are at first withdrawn to cover the (Pu-Cu) of the GSU establishments, 
so that 542 million remain for the individual consumption of all workers in 
total. The question then becomes: what is the quantity accruing to each 
individual worker? In order to provide an answer to this question, we must first 
determine what proportion of the total yield of labour-power has been consumed 
by the GSU (public) establishments. Having achieved that, the problem is solved.</p>

<p class="fst">In the case of the productive establishments, 600 million 
labour-hours were expended by the workers working in them, and in the GSU 
establishments 50 million. For all workers taken together this amounts to 650 
million labour-hours. For individual consumption, however, only 542 million out 
of the total yield of labour-power is available, that is to say a ratio of 
542:650 = 0.83. At the place of work itself, therefore, it is not the full yield 
of labour-power which can be paid out, but only 0.83 of it, or 83%.</p>

<p class="fst">The figure thus obtained, which indicates the proportion of total 
labour-power which is available to be paid out at the separate industrial 
establishments as labour certificates, we name the <i>Remuneration Factor</i>, 
or <i>Factor of Individual Consumption</i> = FIC. In our example it amounts to 
0.83, from which we can calculate that a worker who has worked for 40 hours will 
receive from that the equivalent of only 0.83 x 40 = 33.2 labour-hours in labour 
certificates, indicating the worker's share in total social product available 
according to choice.</p>

<p class="fst">In order to express this in more universal form, we will now 
compile a formula for FIC. First of all we take the value for L. From this we 
subtract (Pu + Cu), so that there remains L - (Pu + Cu). The remainder is 
divided by the number of labour-hours represented by L + Lu, from which we see 
that each worker obtains for his or her individual consumption:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center"><u>L - (Pu + Cu)</u><br>
L + Lu</p>

<p class="fst">If now, for the sake of clarity, we replace the symbols in the 
formula by the actual figures in our example and re-term the remuneration factor 
as the Factor for Individual Consumption (FIC), we then obtain:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">FIC = <u>600 million - 58 million</u><br>
600 million + 50 million</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center"><i>equals</i></p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center"><u>542 million</u><br>
650 million</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center"><i>equals</i><br>
0.83 or 83 percent</p>

<p class="fst">This calculation has been made possible because all industrial 
establishments have maintained an exact record of their consumption of p, c and 
L. The system of general social book-keeping, which registers the stream of 
products by means of a simple system of exchange accounting control, disposes 
directly over all data necessary for determining the Remuneration Factor. These 
are expressed through the symbols L, Pu, Cu and Lu, and can be obtained by means 
of a simple summation in the exchange account.</p>

<p class="fst">With this system of production and distribution the proportion of 
total social product placed at the disposal of any individual is not "allocated" 
subjectively by any agency. What we have here is not a system of distribution 
decided arbitrarily by officials; on the contrary, distribution takes place on 
the basis of the objective exigencies of the system of production itself. The 
relationship of the producers to the social product is objectively embodied in 
that system, and precisely for this reason no subjectively motivated authority 
holds the responsibility for "allocating" anything. This then also explains the 
"mystery" of how it comes about that the role of the State apparatus in the 
economy becomes redundant. The whole economy, both production and distribution, 
stands on objective foundations, because precisely through this relationship the 
producers and consumers are given the power to administer and manage the whole 
process themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">In various meetings and discussions which were held on the above 
theme, anxiety was sometimes expressed in various quarters that the system of 
general social book-keeping could under certain circumstances develop into a new 
organ of exploitation, because it is empowered with the task of determining the 
value of FIC. It could for instance calculate this factor at too low a value.</p>

<p class="fst">It should, however, be borne in mind that there now no longer 
exists any basis whatsoever for exploitation. The entire communist economy is 
made up of only factory or works organisations, and they alone "govern" it. 
Whatever function these may fulfil, they do so only within the limits of their 
budgets. The organ of general social book-keeping is itself just such an 
industrial organisation (GSU-type) and it also can only operate within the 
defined framework. It cannot exercise any power over the economic apparatus, 
because the material basis of the economy has placed control over the economic 
system fully in the hands of the workers, who now constitute the whole of 
society. On the other hand, however, any economic system which is not founded on 
an exactly defined relationship of the producer to the product, and in which 
this relationship is determined subjectively by officials constituted in 
official bodies, must inevitably develop into an apparatus of oppression, even 
if private ownership of means of production has been eliminated.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">4. The Socialisation of Distribution</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Whilst continuing our observations concerning the Remuneration 
Factor, we would now like to introduce into the field of our discussions a 
further question, one which is directly related to it. This question is 
concerned with <i>the process of growth in the direction of the higher stage of 
communism</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">We have seen that one of the most characteristic features of the 
GSU (public) establishments lay in the fact that in their case the principle "to 
each according to his needs" is realised. Here the measure of labour-time plays 
no role in distribution. With the further growth of communism towards its higher 
stage, the incidence of this type of economic establishment becomes more and 
more widespread, so that it comes to include such sectors as food supply, 
passenger transport, housing, etc., in short: the satisfaction of consumption in 
general comes to stand on this economic foundation. This development is <i>a 
process</i> - a process which, at least as far as the technical side of the task 
is concerned, can be completed relatively rapidly. The more society develops in 
this direction and the greater the extent to which products are distributed 
according to this principle, the less does individual labour-time continue to 
act as the measure determining individual consumption. Although at any given 
moment individual labour-time does continue to fulfil this function in some 
degree, as the development towards communism proceeds, to an ever increasing 
extent does this destroy from under its feet the very ground from which it 
sprang. Here we are reminded of what Marx had to say concerning distribution:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The way this division is made will vary with the particular kind 
of social organisation of production and the corresponding level of social 
development attained by the producers. We shall assume, but only for the sake of 
a parallel with the production of commodities, that the share of each individual 
producer in the means of subsistence is determined by his labour-time." (K. 
Marx: <i>Capital</i>, Vol. 1; p. 172)</p>

<p class="fst">What we have shown in our observations is that the road towards 
the higher form of distribution is clearly and comprehensively indicated. Whilst 
the mode of distribution becomes progressively ever more socialised, labour-time 
remains the measure only for that part of the social product which remains 
governed by individual norms of distribution.</p>

<p class="fst">The process through which distribution is socialised does not 
take place spontaneously, but is associated with initiatives taken by the 
workers themselves. Opportunities also exist in plenty through which these 
initiatives may be expressed. Should the production process as a whole be so far 
advanced that a particular branch of it which produces an end product destined 
for individual consumption is operating completely smoothly and without 
disturbances, then nothing stands in the way of integrating that sector of the 
economy into the sphere of fully public (GSU) establishments. All accounting 
procedures in these establishments remain the same. Here the workers do not need 
to wait patiently until it pleases their Excellencies the state officials to 
decide that control over a particular branch is sufficiently firmly consolidated 
in their hands. Because each productive establishment or complex of productive 
establishments represent a self-sufficient unit for the purposes of the control 
budget, the producers themselves are fully able to carry through the process of 
socialisation of distribution.</p>

<p class="fst">The system of autonomous administration ensures that the 
productive system is extremely flexible - a factor which tends to accelerate its 
unhindered growth. It is, for instance, self-evident that the development of the 
process of socialisation of distribution will proceed at various speeds in the 
different sectors and localities, for the simple reason that in one 
establishment the demand for cultural amenities will assume a more powerful 
expression than in another. The inherent flexibility of the productive system 
makes it perfectly possible to accommodate these differences in rates of growth. 
If for instance the workers in one particular district wish to build a greater 
number of public libraries, they dispose in full of the power to do this without 
hindrance. New organs are then built into the system of GSU establishments which 
provide for a greater degree of local initiative, so that the necessary 
expenditures must also then be borne by the district concerned. In the case of 
such a district, the value of FIC will be modified, without any infringement of 
the fundamental relationship of the producers to the social product. In this way 
the workers acquire the power to mould their own social life in all its 
thousandfold variety.</p>

<p class="fst">The process of growth of the system which we have termed 
"consumption according to need" moves and develops within defined limits and 
represents a conscious process adopted by society as a whole; whilst the rate of 
that growth will in the main be determined by the level of social development 
reached by the consumers themselves. The quicker and sooner they learn to 
administer the social product economically, i.e. not to consume it wastefully, 
the quicker will it be possible to achieve socialisation in distribution. For 
the purposes of the control budgets which regulate the totality of production, 
it is a matter of little import whether the number of GSU establishments in 
operation is large or small. As soon as a productive establishment which 
previously surrendered its product for individual consumption against labour 
certificates transfers itself into the GSU sphere, the total GSU budget becomes 
that much larger and the sum of labour certificates to be provided to enable the 
relevant means of life to be consumed in that form becomes ever smaller. The 
Factor of Individual Consumption (FIC) thus becomes ever smaller in a degree 
proportional to the growth of communism.</p>

<p class="fst">It would seem, however, that a Remuneration Factor in the form of 
a Factor of Individual Consumption (FIC) can never disappear completely, because 
it lies in the very nature of social consumption that only those productive 
establishments which supply goods satisfying <i>general</i> needs will be 
amenable for transformation into the GSU type of establishment. A little thought 
will reveal that it will hardly ever be possible to include in the system of 
fully socialised distribution those many and varied articles and goods which 
reflect the special tastes dictated by various individual human interests of a 
specialised kind. Whatever view may be held concerning this, however, the matter 
is not one of principle. The main point is that the road leading towards a fully 
socialised mode of distribution is clearly indicated. The official "marxists" 
describe the above observations as "pure utopia" which have nothing to do with 
Marx. Just how matters stand with this "utopia" will be examined in our 
epilogue. As regards the relevant views held by Marx, however, <i>we can say 
with complete certainty that our perspectives coincide fully with his</i>. 
Referring to the "higher stage of communism" which we have termed fully 
socialised distribution, he writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving 
subordination of the individual to the division of labour, and therewith also 
the antithesis between mental and physical labour, have vanished; after labour 
has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive 
forces have also increased with the all-round development of the individual, and 
all the springs of the co-operative wealth flow more abundantly - only then can 
the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society 
inscribe upon its banners: "From each according to his ability, to each 
according to his needs!" (K. Marx: <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i>; 
Progress Publishers, Moscow; 1978; pp. 17-18)</p>

<p class="fst">Here however, it is also Marx's view that this must be the result 
of <i>an entire process of social development</i>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it 
has <i>developed</i> on its foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it <i>
emerges</i> from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, 
economically, morally and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of 
the old society from whose womb it emerges. Accordingly, the individual producer 
receives back from society - after the deductions have been made - exactly what 
he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labour. For 
example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of 
work; the individual labour time of the individual producer is the part of the 
social working day contributed by him, his share in it. He receives a 
certificate from society that he has furnished such and such an amount of labour 
(after deducting his labour for the common funds), and with this certificate he 
draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as costs the same 
amount of labour. The same amount of labour which he has given to society in one 
form he receives back in another." (K. Marx: ibid; p. 16)</p>

<h3><a name="h5">5. The Mixed Industrial Establishments</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Our observations concerning the remuneration factor, or factor of 
individual consumption (FIC) rest on the basis that the productive industrial 
establishments are fully capable of carrying out their own reproduction, whilst 
the investment needs (input) of the GSU (public) establishments are borne by the 
labour-power of the productive establishments. It was for this reason that we 
devised our formula L - (Pu + Cu) as expressing the quantity of labour-hours 
available for individual consumption. As further development towards the higher 
stage of communism takes place, however, this formula must undergo modification, 
since there must inevitably come into operation many economic establishments 
which produce in part for individual consumption, but also in part in order to 
satisfy the needs of the further development of socialised production towards 
communism. Consider, for instance, the example of the electricity power 
stations. Light and heat are required to satisfy the needs of individual 
domestic consumers, but the product, electricity, is also consumed as light and 
power in the form of a raw material for industry, to satisfy further production. 
Should society have reached a sufficiently mature stage of its development in 
both productive and social respects as to make the adoption of an uncompensated 
supply of electricity for individual needs possible, then with the achievement 
of this step a new type of economic establishment will have come into being, one 
which belongs in part to the sphere of productive establishments and in part to 
that of GSU (public) establishments. These we term <i>Mixed Industrial 
Establishments</i>. The further the process of socialisation of distribution 
develops, the greater is the role played by this type of mixed establishment.</p>

<p class="fst">It is self-evident that this development must make its effects 
felt both in the system of the industrial control budget as also in the 
determination of the value of FIC. For the purposes of drawing up the system of 
accounting control the mixed type of industrial establishment must be classified 
under the heading of one or the other of the two main types: productive or GSU 
(public). However, under which precisely of these two it is placed is in itself 
unimportant; for the purposes of accounting control all mixed establishments can 
be grouped either with the productive or with the GSU establishments; it is also 
possible to place some under one group and others under the other, as may be 
found expedient. The system of control budgeting thus forms no hindrance to the 
flexibility of production and distribution. We will consider first the case in 
which a mixed industrial establishment has been grouped with the productive 
establishments, in order to ascertain the consequences this has for the 
determination of the value of FIC.</p>

<p class="fst">In its role as a fully-productive establishment, under the 
previous system all the kilowatt hours supplied by our electricity generating 
station were credited to it in the exchange account, and hence it was fully 
capable of carrying out its own reproduction. With the conversion to 
"uncompensated individual supply", however, a debit quantity arises in the 
exchange account which is exactly equivalent to the amount of individual 
consumption. Those labour-hours which the electricity generating station is 
required to supply for individual consumption of light, heat and power must 
therefore be restored to it out of the total quantity of FIC. This debit 
represents a charge against the total GSU budget and is thus met out of FIC. If 
we now add together all the debits arising from operations of the mixed 
establishments, we then arrive at the general or total debits which likewise 
have to be met out of FIC. Representing this general debit quantity with the 
letter D, we obtain the following formula:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">FIC = <u>L - ( Pu + Cu) - D</u><br>
L + Lu</p>

<p class="fst">Let us now consider the electricity works in its function as a 
GSU (public) establishment. The GSU establishments have no income and their 
reproduction needs therefore represent a total charge against the labour-power 
of the productive establishments. The mixed industrial establishment however 
receives by way of its supply of means of production or raw materials to other 
establishments, a credit amount in the exchange account. That is to say, it is 
partially capable of carrying out its own reproduction; its total consumption of 
(Pu + Cu) + Lu is not charged against the labour-power of the productive 
establishments, because it is able to some extent to satisfy its own 
requirements in means of production and raw materials. If now we apply the 
letter G (Gain) to represent that portion which arises out of its own 
reproduction, then there arises as a charge against the labour-power of each 
productive establishment only (pu + cu) + Lu - g. If now we relate that to the 
totality of all mixed establishments, then the amount which must be supplied out 
of FIC is represented by (Pu + Cu) + Lu - G. Thus finally we obtain the formula:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">FIC = <u>L - ( Pu + Cu) + G</u><br>
L + Lu</p>

<p class="fst">As the third and final example which will arise out of the actual 
operation of the accounting control budget, there now remains the task of 
classifying, for purposes of the control budget, the one type of mixed 
establishment under the heading of the productive establishments and the other 
under that of the GSU (public) establishments. Here the mixed-productive 
establishments have a charge to make against the GSU budget in the amount of D 
(Debit) labour-hours, whilst the GSU establishments restored to the productive 
establishments those labour-hours represented by G (Gain). As a charge against 
FIC there thus remains D - G. The factor of individual consumption thus becomes:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">FIC = <u>L - ( Pu + Cu) - ( D - G )</u><br>
L + Lu</p>

<p class="fst">(The above formula represents a simplified form. If it is 
necessary to carry out further mathematical investigations into problems 
associated with the accounting control budget, it will be necessary to express G 
and D in terms of (P + C), an operation which can be carried out without any 
difficulty).</p>
