<h4>CHAPTER I</h4>
<h1><a name="h0">State Communism or The Association of Free and Equal Producers</a></h1>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">1. State Communism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The attempts made in Russia to construct a communist society have 
introduced into the field of human practice a sphere which previously could be 
treated only in theory, at least as far as industrial production was concerned. 
Russia has attempted to order economic life according to the principles of 
communism ... and in this has failed completely! The fact that wages no longer 
increase to correspond with the rising productivity of labour<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> provides 
sufficient evidence of this. A greater degree of productivity achieved by the 
system of social production brings with it no commensurately greater share in 
the social product. This indicates that exploitation exists. Henriette 
Roland-Holst proves that the Russian worker today is a wage-worker. One may try 
to make light of the matter by referring to the fact that Russia is still an 
agrarian country in that private ownership of land still exists, and that 
because of this the very basis of wage-labour necessarily imposes itself upon 
the whole economic foundation of social life. Whoever finds this explanation 
satisfactory may indeed be perceiving the economic foundations of present-day 
Russia in an objectively correct light, but in respect of the gigantic attempts 
of the Russians to implement a communist economy that person has nevertheless 
learnt nothing. It is for this reason that doubts have arisen amongst many 
proletarians concerning the method which is being applied by the Russians, and 
which it is supposed will lead to the establishment of communism. It is a 
well-known method, which in a few words may be summed up as follows: the working 
class expropriates the appropriators and places control over the means of 
production in the hands of the state, which then proceeds to organise the 
various branches of industry and places them as a state monopoly at the disposal 
of society.</p>

<p class="fst">In Russia matters developed in such a way that the proletariat 
was able to take command of the factories and to continue running them under its 
own management. The Communist Party, as the sovereign wielder of state power, 
then issued directives according to which the factories were to link together 
their Workers' Councils (Soviets) at communal, district and gubernial (county) 
level, in order to unite the whole of industrial life into one organic unit. In 
this way the productive apparatus was built up out of the vital energies alive 
in the working masses. It was an expression of the drive towards communism which 
lived in the proletariat. All forces were directed towards the centralisation of 
production. The 3rd Congress of the All-Russian Economic Council took the 
decision:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Centralised administration of the peoples' economy is the most 
certain means in the possession of the victorious proletariat for achieving the 
most rapid development of the productive forces throughout the whole country ... 
It is simultaneously the precondition for the socialist construction of the 
peoples' economy and for incorporation of the smaller enterprises into the 
unified economic structure. Centralisation is the sole means for avoiding any 
tendency towards a fragmentation of the peoples' economy."<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In just the same way as, at the commencement of this development, 
the essential element in the situation lay in the fact that control over the 
management of industrial production was in the hands of the masses, with an 
equally inexorable compulsion was it inevitable that at a later stage these 
powers would be transferred to the central administrative organs. If at first 
the directorates, communal councils etc. were responsible to the masses of 
workers, the producers, in the end they became subordinated to the central 
administration, which directed the whole. At the beginning: responsibility from 
below; at the end: responsibility from above. It was in this way that in Russia 
a gigantic concentration of productive forces as no other land on earth had ever 
attempted was carried through. Woe betide that proletariat which is compelled to 
struggle against such an apparatus of power!. And in spite of all, this is the 
reality which has overtaken Russia! There can now be not the slightest doubt: 
the Russian worker is a wage worker, a worker exploited! These workers must 
struggle for their wages against the mightiest state apparatus the world has 
ever known!</p>

<p class="fst">The fundamental point to which we would draw attention here is 
that, in the case of this form of communism, the proletariat has no control over 
the productive apparatus. In the mere formal sense, it is the owner of the means 
of production, but it nevertheless has no right of disposal over them. Precisely 
what proportion of the total social stock of products the producer may receive 
in return for the work performed is determined by a central administration 
which, if everything proceeds according to plan, determines this on the basis of 
statistics. In reality, the decision as to whether or not exploitation should 
take place is vested in a central authority. Even in the case in which a 
benevolent administration is in command, which then distributes the products in 
an equitable way, it remains nevertheless an apparatus which has elevated itself 
over the producers. The question then becomes one as to whether this state of 
affairs has come to pass in Russia on account of the special conditions 
prevailing there, or whether in this case we have a characteristic feature 
typical of each and every central administration concerned with production and 
distribution. Should the latter be the case, the possibility of establishing 
communism would become very problematical indeed.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">2. Varying Marxist Opinions</a></h3>

<p class="fst">With the single exception of Marx, we find in the case of 
virtually all writers who have concerned themselves with the organisation of 
economic life in a communist society the same principles being advocated as 
those which the Russians have applied in practice. In this, they base themselves 
upon the well-known dictum of Engels: "The proletariat conquers state power and 
as its first act proclaims the means of production to be state property."<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> 
They then set about the task of centralisation and begin to construct 
organisations of a similar type to those which the Russians have called into 
being. Thus for instance write Rudolf Hilferding and Otto Neurath, names which 
could be extended by a whole series of other 'experts':</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Exactly how, where, in what quantity and by what means new 
products will be produced out of the existing and man-made means of production 
... is decided by the social commissariats of the socialist society at national 
or local level. It is they who mould with conscious intent the whole of economic 
life, utilising for this purpose all the instruments at the disposal of 
organised production and consumption statistics, in accordance with the needs of 
the communities as they, the social commissariats, have consciously represented 
and formulated them."<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">And Neurath expresses this even more clearly:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The science of the Socialist economy recognises only one single 
economic master: society itself, which, without reckoning of profit or loss, 
without the circulation of any form of money, whether it be precious metals or 
'labour money' reflecting an economic plan, organises production without the aid 
of any unit of accounting control and distributes the means of life according to 
Socialist principles."<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Anyone can see that they both arrive at the same kind of social 
structure as that erected by the Russians. Even if we assume such structures are 
actually viable (a fact which we deny) and that the central administration and 
the organs of social control would be willing or able to distribute the mass of 
products in an equitable way in accordance with the accepted differing standards 
of living - even then, and even if we assume that the myriad economic exchanges 
involved occur smoothly, the fact would still pertain that the producers have in 
reality no right of control over the productive apparatus. It becomes not an 
apparatus of the producers, but one placed over them.</p>

<p class="fst">Such a state of affairs can lead to nothing other than the 
forcible suppression of groups which, for whatever reason, come to adopt a 
position of opposition over and against the administration. <i>The central 
economic power is simultaneously the political power</i>. Every oppositional 
element which, in respect of either political or economic affairs, wishes to 
arrange matters differently to that willed by the central administration will be 
suppressed with all the means at the disposal of the all-powerful state 
apparatus. It is certainly not necessary to give concrete examples of this - 
they are already familiar enough. In this way the Association of Free and Equal 
Producers proclaimed by Marx becomes a prison-state such as humanity has never 
before experienced!</p>

<p class="fst">The Russians, no less than all the other theoretical schools, 
call themselves Marxists and of course proclaim their theory to be true 
communism. In reality, however, it has nothing to do with Marx. It is bourgeois 
economics, a capitalist administration and control of production projected in 
communist terms. The historical perspective's of the Bolshevik tendency are 
expressed in the fact that they have observed how, already under capitalism, the 
production process becomes subject to an ever greater degree of socialisation. 
The free producer of commodities is hemmed in on every side by trades unions, 
trusts, etc; production is indeed already "communist!:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The overcoming of capitalist modes of thought as an incipient 
social phenomenon presumes the carrying through of an all-embracing process. It 
is highly likely that Socialism will first of all establish itself as an 
economic order, so that socialists will first be created through the Socialist 
order, and not, conversely, the Socialist order through the socialists - a 
sequence which, furthermore, stands in complete harmony with the basic ideas of 
Marxism."<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Should it be the case that the economy has become &quot;communist&quot; in 
this way, it is necessary only that the production relations be transformed in 
such a way that the means of production become state property, and then:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"... a socially planned regulation of production in accordance 
with the needs of the community and of each individual takes the place of the 
anarchy of social production."<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">On the basis of this plan-determined control they then construct 
their system further. In order to bring the plan to completion, it is necessary 
only to install a new management in charge of the capitalist production 
apparatus - and communist society is there, ready made!</p>

<p class="fst">This perspective of communism, according to which the proletariat 
only needs to place a new management in charge of production in order that, with 
the help of statistics, this will then arrange everything for the best in the 
best of all possible "communist" worlds, derives its basic origin in 
consciousness from the fact that the type of economist or sociologist, whose 
brainchild this is, is unable to conceive of the growth of planned production as 
an aspect of the development of the working masses themselves, but can conceive 
of it only as a process which they - the economic experts - are called upon to 
carry through and complete. Not the working masses, but they, the leaders, are 
destined to guide the bankrupt capitalist system of production into communism. 
It is <i>they</i> who have the knowledge, they who think, organise and order. 
The sole role which the masses have to fulfil is to endorse which they in their 
wisdom have decided. Towering above the mass of working people stand the 
economic experts and leaders with their science, looked up to in reverence by 
the masses as the custodians of a temple of social marvels which remains closed 
to them. Science would then be the possession of the great men, from whom the 
light of the new society beams out. Needless to say, in this form of society, 
the producers have no control or administrative power whatever over production, 
so that the picture thereby painted represents a strange version indeed of 
Marx's concept of the Association of Free and Equal Producers.</p>

<p class="fst">All plans of this kind bear clearly the birthmarks bestowed on 
them by the period of history in which they have been born: in this case, <i>the 
epoch of the development of the mechanical sciences</i>. The productive system 
is conceived as an intricate mechanism which functions through thousands and 
tens of thousands of gears and cog-wheels. The various parts of the productive 
process function integrally with one another in much the same way as do the 
separate yet interdependent partial functions of a production belt, like those 
found in a modern factory - for instance, Ford. Here and there stand the 
controllers of the production apparatus, who control the operation of the 
machines by means of their statistics.</p>

<p class="fst">These mechanical plans have their origin in a fundamental error, 
namely, the idea that communism is primarily a matter of the ordering of 
organisational-technical processes. In reality, the fundamental question is an 
economic one: <i>how the basic relationship between producer and product is to 
be determined</i>. It is for this reason that we say, in respect of this 
mechanical conception, that it is necessary to find the foundation which will 
enable the producers themselves to construct the edifice of production. This act 
of construction is a process which proceeds from below upwards and not from 
above downwards. It is a process of concentration which is fulfilled by the 
producers themselves, and not in such a way as if mana from heaven were to fall 
upon them from above. If it is our wish to take the experience of the revolution 
to heart and to follow the guidelines given us by Karl Marx, it is even now 
possible for us to make appreciable progress along this road.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">3. Nationalisation and Socialisation</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Although no one has left us with a detailed description of a 
communist society, the adoption of the viewpoint of Karl Marx, that this new 
mode of social production would in essence be <i>an Association of Free and 
Equal Producers</i>, and would come into being quite independently of the 
theories of Social Democrats, or even communists, seems a reasonable one. It is 
not the state which is conceived as being the leader and administrator of 
production and distribution, but far rather it is the producers and consumers 
themselves to whom these functions would fall.</p>

<p class="fst">The reformist school has in the course of years turned this 
theory completely upside down. The struggle for social reforms and the steady 
transformation of the various branches of industry into state or municipal 
enterprises meant for them a steady approach towards communism. Wherever 
capitalist development had brought any particular branch of production to such a 
degree of concentration that it could function as a unitary structure under 
central administration, then this would indicate that it was ripe for 
nationalisation. Whilst reformist Social Democracy conceived of realising 
communism through a continuous and gradual process of nationalisation, the 
revolutionary Bolshevik tendency considered that a revolution was necessary in 
order to complete the process of nationalisation. <i>Thus the conception of the 
men from Moscow is based on fundamentally the same theoretical methods as that 
of the reformists</i>. During and after the revolution those industrial units 
which have become ripe for nationalisation will be operated through the state, 
whilst that part of the economy which is not yet sufficiently concentrated will 
remain in the hands of private capital.</p>

<p class="fst">The Russian Revolution proceeded according to this scheme. In the 
year 1917 the producers in Russia began to expropriate the owning class 
throughout the whole economy, with the intention of ordering production and 
distribution according to communist principles. The process of expropriation 
began from below, to the great discomfiture of those who wished to lead and 
administer the economy from above. It was in this way that the Russian economic 
administration returned to their former owners many factories which had been 
expropriated by the workers, because they were considered not yet sufficiently 
"mature" for communist administration. The First All-Russian Congress of 
Economic Councils thereupon decreed the following decision:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In the sphere of the organisation of production, it is necessary 
to introduce final measures of nationalisation. It is necessary to move forward 
from the implementation of nationalisation measures for separate enterprises (so 
far 304) to the consistent nationalisation of industry as a whole. <i>
Nationalisation must not be a matter of occasional expediency</i>, <i>and must 
be carried out only by the Supreme Council of Peoples' Commissars</i>, <i>with 
authorisation by the All-Russian Congress of Economic Councils.</i>"<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Here we see quite clearly the difference between nationalisation 
according to the Social Democratic ideal and the actual communist conception of 
socialisation.</p>

<p class="fst">In this we also see the distinction between industrial 
enterprises which are considered already ripe for communism and those which are 
not, a concept of which Marx apparently would never have dreamed. F. Oppenheimer 
has very correctly observed in the Symposium edited by H. Beck on 'Methods and 
Aims of Socialisation':</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The illusion gains ground that the Marxist concept of 
'socialisation' is being promoted step by step through the widespread 
characterisation of nationalisation or municipalisation of individual industrial 
enterprises as a form of socialisation. It is for this reason also that an 
otherwise incomprehensible and mysterious emphasis is placed upon 'mature 
enterprises ...'. For Marx, however, socialist society can become mature only <i>
as a whole</i>. Separate industrial establishments or branches of such 
establishments can, according to him, just as little become 'mature' and 'ready 
for socialisation' as the separate organs of an embryo in the fourth month of 
pregnancy can become mature and be delivered to lead an independent 
existence."<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">"What then becomes apparent is that this <i>nationalisation</i> 
can only lead to the construction of <i>state socialism</i>, in which the state 
emerges as a single vast employer and exploiter."<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The aim however should be not to restrict the energy of the 
masses, who themselves carry out the process of socialisation, but to 
incorporate them as living cells into the whole organism of communist economy - 
a development which, in its turn, becomes possible only if and when the 
appropriate general economic conditions are present. The creators of use-values 
are then able themselves to integrate their factories into the overall sphere of 
social production, and so to determine the basis of the relationship of the 
producers to the social product.</p>

<p class="fst">The only writer who, as far as we know, tries to speak the truth 
on matters of this kind is the reformist H. Cunow. He says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In the last analysis, it is nevertheless Marx's intention, in 
opposition to the Cobden School, that a fixed control of the economic process 
should be applied. <i>Not</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>through the state</i>, <i>but 
through the unification of the free associations of the socialist society.</i>"<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the section on "The Negation of the State and State 
Socialism", Cunow shows us how German Social Democracy came to desert this 
standpoint only gradually. At the beginning the movement opposed those 
tendencies which wished to bring large undertakings such as railways and mines 
under state administration. One example will suffice. On page 340 of the 
above-mentioned work we read how, in an article, W. Liebknecht expounded the 
view:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"It is intended gradually to nationalise one industrial 
enterprise after another. In other words, to replace the private employers with 
the state, to continue capitalist industry only with a different exploiter ... 
It (the state) appears as employer in the place of the private employers, and 
the workers gain nothing from this, although indeed the state has strengthened 
its power and its means of oppression ... The more bourgeois society comes to 
realise that it cannot defend itself for ever against the tide of socialist 
ideas, the more do we approach that moment at which state socialism is 
proclaimed in real earnest, and the last battle which Democracy has to fight out 
will be waged under the slogan: "Forward to Social Democracy, forward to State 
Socialism!"<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Cunow then demonstrates that this standpoint was already 
abandoned before 1900, and in 1917 K. Renner declared: "The state will become 
the lever of socialism" (See: Marxism, War and the International). Cunow is in 
full agreement with this, but it remains to his credit that he makes it fully 
clear that all this has nothing to do with Marx. Cunow makes it a matter of 
complaint against Marx that he made so sharp a distinction between state and 
society, which in his view does not exist, or at least is no longer a valid 
concept.</p>

<p class="fst">With their practice of nationalisation according to 'mature' 
industrial enterprises, such as has been implemented in Russia, the Bolsheviks 
have in reality given Marxism a slap in the face. Indeed, they have thereby 
transferred their allegiance to the social-democratic concept of the identity of 
state and society. In Russia, this practice is already making its results felt 
in the most oppressive way. Society does not hold control over the means of 
production and the production process. These are in the hands of the ruling 
clique, which appoints and administers everything "in the name of society" 
(Engels) ... . That is to say, they are in the position to suppress by hitherto 
unprecedented means each and every group or individual attempting to oppose the 
new form of exploitation. Russia, which should have been an example of 
communism, has by this means developed into the ideal of the social-democratic 
future.</p>

<p class="fst">We have dwelt at somewhat greater length upon this type of 
nationalisation in order to show that this has nothing in common with Marx, and 
that Marxism is in fact compromised thereby. It was especially after the 
experience of the Paris Commune that the view began to gain ground with Marx 
that the organisation of the economy <i>could not be realised through the state 
but only through a combination of the Free Associations of the Socialist society</i>. 
With the discovery of the precise forms by means of which the proletariat 
organises itself for revolutionary class struggle, for the conquest of economic 
and political power - the Workers' Councils - the historical foundations on the 
basis of which the society of freely associating producers must be historically 
constructed are brought to light and fully revealed for all to perceive and 
comprehend.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">4. The Average Social Hour of Labour</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Marx therefore took his stand upon the concept of the 
"Association of Free and Equal Producers". This Association, however, has 
nothing in the least to do with the vague concepts of 'mutual aid' which are 
currently circulating, but has a very material basis. <i>That basis is the 
computation of the labour-time which is necessary in order to produce use-values</i>. 
As will be demonstrated in the course of this text, this has nothing to do with 
value. That this was also consistent with Engels' viewpoint can be seen from the 
following:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Society will be able to calculate in a simple way how many hours 
of labour are contained in a steam engine, a bushel of the last crop of wheat, 
or a hundred square yards of cloth of a specific quality. It could therefore 
never occur to it to go expressing the quantities of labour put into the 
products, quantities which it will then know directly and absolutely, in yet a 
third product, in a measure which, moreover, is only relative, fluctuating and 
inadequate, though it was formerly unavoidable as an expedient, rather than 
express them in their natural, adequate and absolute measure: <i>time</i>."<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Marx also very clearly indicates the labour-hour as the unit of 
computation. In his well-known discussion of "Robinson on his Island" he says of 
this island inhabitant:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Necessity itself compels him to divide his time with precision 
between his different functions. Whether one function occupies a greater space 
of his total activity than another depends on the magnitude of the difficulties 
to be overcome in attaining the useful effect aimed at. Our friend Robinson 
Crusoe learns this by experience, and having saved a watch, ledger, ink and pen 
from the shipwreck, he soon begins, like a good Englishman, to keep a set of 
books. His stock-book contains a catalogue of the various objects he possesses, 
of the various operations necessary for their production, and finally, of the 
labour-time that specific quantities of these products have on average cost him. 
All the relations between Robinson and these objects that form his self-created 
wealth are here so simple and transparent that even Mr Sedley Taylor could 
understand them."<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">"Let us finally imagine, for a change, an association of free 
men, working with the means of production held in common, and expending their 
many different forms of labour-power in full self-awareness as one single social 
labour force. All the characteristics of Robinson's labour are represented, but 
with the difference that they are social instead of individual."<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">We see here that Marx, in his "Association of Freely Associating 
Producers", conceives in exactly the same way of a computation of labour-time, 
and indeed on the selfsame basis of the labour-hour. Where, however, Marx has 
set his freely associating producers in place of Robinson, we now see that we 
can just as readily place the system of social book-keeping which communism 
places at society's disposal, to arrive at the following paraphrase of Marx's 
text:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Its stock-book contains a catalogue of the useful objects it 
possesses, of the various operations necessary for their production, and 
finally, of the labour-time that specific quantities of these products have on 
average cost it. All the relations between the members of society and the 
objects that form their self-created wealth are here so simple and transparent 
that anyone could understand them."</p>

<p class="fst">Marx assumes this system of social book-keeping to be in general 
applicable to a production process in which labour is social; that is to say, it 
is equally applicable whether communism is still at an early stage of its 
development, or whether the principle "From each according to his abilities, to 
each according to his needs" (the higher stage of communism) has already been 
achieved. In other words: the organisation of economic life may in the course of 
the various periods of development move through various stages, <i>but the 
stable basis for all of them nevertheless remains the unit of average social 
labour-time</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">That Marx did indeed understand the matter thus is for instance 
apparent from the fact that he is at pains to demonstrate with special emphasis 
that distribution can assume various forms. Neurath infers from this that Marx 
has posed the question in such a way as to suggest that we have a free choice as 
to <i>how</i> the products are to be distributed. A strange error indeed for 
such a "Marx expert" who surely must know that Marx knows nothing of freedom in 
this matter, but only of functionally derived organic necessity. Freedom of 
choice in respect of a system of distribution is circumscribed within the limits 
set by the structure imposed through the system of production. Nevertheless, 
this is subject to certain modifications which will be discussed later.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"All Robinson's products were exclusively the result of his own 
personal labour and they were therefore directly objects of utility for him 
personally. The total product of our imagined association is a social product. 
One part of this product serves as fresh means of production and remains social. 
But another part is consumed by members of the association as means of 
subsistence. This part must therefore be divided amongst them. The way this 
division is made will vary with the particular kind of social organisation of 
production and the corresponding level of social development attained by the 
producers."<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">If, taking this as his basis, Marx was very well able to provide 
the fundamental category determining, in a communist society, the method of 
economic regulation and accounting control applicable in the sphere of 
production, in the case of the sphere of distribution he demonstrates this 
purely by way of example. Thus he writes further:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"We shall assume, but only for the sake of a parallel with the 
production of commodities, that the share of each individual producer in the 
means of subsistence is determined by his labour-time. Labour-time would in that 
case play a double part. Its apportionment in accordance with a definite social 
plan maintains the correct proportion between the different functions of labour 
and the various needs of the associations. On the other hand, labour-time also 
serves as a measure of the part taken by each individual in the common labour, 
and of this share in the part of the total product destined for individual 
consumption. The social relations of the individual producers, both toward their 
labour and the products of their labour, are here transparent in their 
simplicity, in production as well as in distribution."<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Marx also reveals elsewhere in his text that he conceives labour-time 
to be the basic category of the communist economy:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"With collective production, money-capital is completely 
dispensed with. The society distributes labour-power and means of production 
between the various branches of industry. There is no reason why the producers 
should not receive paper tokens permitting them to withdraw an amount 
corresponding to their labour time from the social consumption stocks. But these 
tokens are not money. They do not circulate."<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">If it is individual labour-time which is to serve as the measure 
for the product to be individually consumed, then the mass of products must also 
be measured according to the same yardstick. In other words, the products must 
have impressed upon them how much human labour-power, measured in time, how many 
average social hours of labour, they contain. This assumes, however, that the 
other categories of production (means of production, raw and auxiliary 
materials, etc.) have been measured according to the same scale, so that the 
entire system of accounting control for production in the separate industrial 
establishments must be based upon the average social hour of labour. Then one 
can with all justice declare: "The social relations of human beings towards one 
another, both as regards their labour and the products of their labour, remain 
here simple and clearly understood, in production as well as in distribution."</p>

<p class="fst">Thus we can see that Neurath is in error when he assumes that 
production and distribution have so little connection with one another that we 
can have "free choice". Quite the contrary! If Marx adopts individual 
labour-time as the measure determining the individual's share in the product, 
then by this means he simultaneously lays the basis for the relationship between 
producer and product, according to which the foundations of production are also 
determined.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us now return to the question as to whether or not a system 
of planned use-value production, such as would be expressed in an organically 
integrated economic apparatus, of necessity must lead to a system which raises 
itself as an alien force over the producers. We say: <i>No! In a society in 
which the relation of the producers to the social product is directly expressed</i>, <i>
this danger does not exist. In every other social formation in which this 
principle does not pertain</i>, <i>the system of production must finally and 
inevitably develop into an apparatus of oppression</i>.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">5. Towards The Association of Free and Equal Producers</a></h3>

<p class="fst">In the form of its system of production, humanity has created an 
organism designed to satisfy the needs of tens of thousands of human beings. In 
the course of their production, we use up both our own labour-power and the 
production process itself. Seen from this point of view, the process of 
production is simultaneously a process of destruction, a process of the using up 
of resources; nevertheless, through this very process of destruction we 
continuously create new use-values. That which has been consumed is born again 
in the same process. Machines, tools, our own labour-power, are simultaneously 
renewed in this process, are produced anew, or <i>reproduced</i>. It is an 
unremitting stream of reformed human energy, energy changed from one form into 
another. Each specific form is crystallised human energy, which we can measure 
according to the time during which labour is expended in order to create it.</p>

<p class="fst">The same yardstick applies to that part of the production process 
in which no physical products are created, such as for instance education, the 
health service, etc. Here also means of production and labour-power are 
expended, in which cases the product simply takes the form of the instruction 
received, the care given to the sick, etc. Distribution takes place directly in 
and through production itself, and the expended energies flow in their new form 
directly into society. Because of the fact that we are able to measure these 
energies in time, a fully exact relation between producer and product is 
established. The relation of each individual producer to each specific social 
product is in this way rendered wholly and clearly perceivable.</p>

<p class="fst">In the case of the organisation of production according to the 
schemes of Neurath or Hilferding, or as it is implemented in Russia, this 
relationship is, on the contrary, <i>completely concealed</i>. Here it is a 
process veiled in mystery, and the producers themselves certainly know even less 
about it than the state administrators. In this case, therefore, a definite 
proportion of the social product must be allocated to the producers by a 
superior authority, and the former must await trustfully that which they are to 
receive. This is how matters proceed in Russia. Although productivity may rise, 
although the mass of social products may increase, the producer nevertheless 
receives no increase in the share - that is to say, exploitation exists.</p>

<p class="fst">What should the producers undertake against this? Nothing? Yes 
indeed, they must take up once again the cause of struggle against the 
exploiter, against those who hold control over the system of production in their 
hands! One may attempt to place "better leaders" in power, although this of 
course does not lead to the removal of the causes of exploitation. In the final 
analysis, there remains no other road forward than that of reconstructing the 
entire system of production in such a way that the exact relationship of the 
producers to the products fashioned by their labour becomes the foundation of 
the social system of production. In such a system, however, the task of the 
leaders and administrators in respect of the allocation of the products is also 
eliminated. <i>There remains nothing to allocate</i>. The share in the social 
product is determined directly. Labour-time serves as the measure for 
determining the proportion of the total product to be individually consumed.</p>

<p class="fst">The question as to whether or not the proletariat, in the course 
of a communist transformation of society, succeeds in establishing this 
relationship between producer and product is in the final instance a question of 
social power. It is on this basis, and this basis alone, that planned production 
is possible. The separate industrial units, and indeed whole industries, can 
then be integrated both horizontally and vertically into a single planned whole, 
whilst all sections compute quite autonomously their share in the total 
accounting of labour-time used up in its various forms, these being essentially: 
wear and tear on machinery, consumption of raw and auxiliary materials and 
expenditure of labour. This fundamental ordering and organisation of communist 
production can, and indeed <i>must</i>, be brought into being by the producers 
themselves, can indeed be established <i>by them alone</i>. The Association of 
Free and Equal Producers then becomes an absolute necessity. The system of 
interlocking relations and mutual interdependence grows from below, precisely 
because the producers themselves, in their own right, have control over 
management and administration. Now the necessary scope has been created to allow 
for the initiative of the producers themselves to be expressed, who are thereby 
able to create the moving and developing forms needed by social life in all 
their thousandfold forms.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a></p>

<p class="fst"><i>It is the proletariat itself which lays in place the 
foundation-stone cementing the basic relationship between producers and the 
product of their labour. This and this alone is the key question of the 
proletarian revolution</i>. In just the same way as the feudal serf struggled in 
the bourgeois revolution for his piece of land and for the full right of 
disposal over the fruits of his labour, in the same way the proletariat now 
struggles for control of the factories and other industrial establishments and 
for full right of disposal over production - an outcome which is only possible 
if the fundamental relationship between producer and product has been fought to 
its final conclusion in a new social legality. The decisive question at issue 
here is precisely that of the place the proletariat is to win for itself in 
society; the question as to whether, along with the right to labour in the 
work-places, the right of disposal over the products of these work-places is 
also achieved; or, on the contrary, whether the proletariat is once again to be 
pronounced incapable of discharging responsibility, and leaders, experts and 
scientists are to be entrusted with that right of disposal. In the final 
instance, this struggle will be fought out against those who believe that they 
are destined, after the revolution, to assume responsibility on behalf of the 
proletariat. It is for this reason that the cooperation of such people is only 
appropriate if the foundations of communist production have first been laid. It 
is this basis alone that their skills may work for society, whereas otherwise 
they can develop only into a new ruling caste.</p>

<p class="fst">The so-called 'dictatorship of the proletariat' suppresses 
everything which opposes the ruling administration, until all branches of 
production have become sufficiently "mature" as to be integrated by their 
respective supreme management bodies into the general structure of power and 
administration. In the case of the "Association of Free and Equal Producers", 
workers' rule serves the purpose of introducing and carrying through the new 
system of production, accounting and regulation on the basis of average social 
labour-time as the general foundation of all production, and in order to create 
the basis on which the free producers themselves may control production and 
administer it. In the case of state capitalism, on the other hand, the general 
conditions are such as will create the strongest machinery of suppression under 
the control of a central apparatus. In the case of the system of freely 
associating producers, it functions so as to bring to life and to promote those 
very forces through which it itself as the function of rule progressively loses 
power, in order finally to make itself superfluous; <i>workers' rule works so as 
to bring about its own demise at the earliest possible historical moment</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Without concerning ourselves further with state capitalism, we 
should far rather now proceed to examine how it comes about that any 
'reasonable' person at this present historical juncture may still embrace and 
adhere to the 'naive' conception of Marx (who is supposed to have derived this 
out of the liberal-anarchist tendencies of his time)<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a> which held that the 
regulation of economic life should come "about not through the state, but 
through a union of the Free Associations of the Socialist society", and in which 
the fundamental category of economic life should be the average social hour of 
labour. Indeed, over and above all this, it is necessary to take steps to ensure 
that this 'naive' conception of Marx is shown to be <i>the sole possible 
foundation upon which communism might be achieved</i>. To pose the question in 
this way means simultaneously to declare that this conception was not in the 
first place born behind a writing-desk, but was itself the product of a 
seething, developing revolutionary life-activity.</p>

<p class="fst">So far as it is possible for us to look back upon events in 
review, we may count three decisive moments which marked our disillusionment 
with the sycophantic hymns chanted by the 'communist economists'. The first was 
the spontaneous development and functioning of the Soviet system; the second the 
disarming of the Soviets by the Russian state apparatus; and the third and final 
moment of disillusionment the growth of state-administered production into a 
new, hitherto unknown form of rule over the whole of society. These facts 
compelled us to undertake a closer examination, an examination which revealed 
that state capitalism, in both theory and practice, has absolutely nothing in 
common with Marxism. At the same time as social life itself, through its 
definite expression, social practice, has, in the form of the Workers' Councils, 
the Soviet system, impelled Marx's concept of the Association of Free and Equal 
Producers into the forefront of history, that same social life, with its 
objective criticism of theory and practice, has simultaneously given the actual 
power in society to state capitalism.</p>
