<h1><a name="h0">The System of General Social Book-Keeping as a System of Control Over the 
Economic Process</a></h1>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">1. The Method of Control by Subjective Administrative Decision</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Among the various functions of the system of general social 
book-keeping, we have named up to now the registration of the stream of 
products; the determination of the Remuneration Factor, or Factor of Individual 
Consumption (FIC); and the issuing of labour certificates. Now we will also draw 
into its general sphere of competence the function of control over production 
and distribution.</p>

<p class="fst">It is obvious that the form assumed by this means of control 
stands in close association with the foundations of the economy as a whole. In 
the case of State communism, in which the whole of economic life is subjected to 
regulation by means of subjective norms and on the basis of statistics, control 
also appears as a function of <i>administrative decision</i>. In a system based 
upon the Association of Free and Equal Producers, with labour-time computation 
as the basis of production and in which the distribution of all products is 
determined objectively by the process of production itself, the processes 
through which control is implemented also assume an exact form. Such a system of 
control takes into account all the separate elements represented by production, 
reproduction, accumulation and distribution, and proceeds to a certain extent 
automatically.</p>

<p class="fst">In his book <i>Die wirtschaftspolitischen Probleme der 
proletarischen Diktatur</i>, Varga provides us with a description of how control 
is implemented under the system of State communism. He writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"It will be a part of the sphere of responsibility of the 
centrally organised management to exercise control over the works administration 
and the day-to-day management of affairs in respect of state property, a problem 
which has caused a great many difficulties in Russia. ..."</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The frivolous treatment of state property, of the 
disappropriated property of the bourgeoisie, derives above all from the 
capitalistically egotistical tendency endemic in society as a whole, a tendency 
which is due at least in part to the fact that moral awareness has been 
especially undermined as a result of the long duration of the war. However, an 
additional factor which plays a role here is the widespread prevalence of a lack 
of clarity concerning the new property relations. Those proletarians to whom has 
fallen the task of administrating the disappropriated factories are only too 
prone to adopt the belief that the factories are their own property, not that of 
the whole of society. This makes a smoothly functioning system of control all 
the more important, since it simultaneously represents an excellent means of 
education ..."</p>

<p class="quoteb">"<i>The problem of social control found an excellent solution in 
Hungary</i>. The inspectors, who previously had served the capitalists, 
underwent an increase in numbers through the training for this function of 
judges and middle-school teachers, and these, as employees of the state, were 
brought together into a special section under the Peoples' Economic Council. 
This section was divided into professional groups, so that the same inspectors 
were made permanently responsible for factories belonging to particular branches 
of industry. The spheres of control extended not only to financial dues and 
taxes on materials, but also concerned themselves with the correct deployment of 
the labour force, investigations into the causes of poor performance or of 
unsatisfactory results generally. The inspector responsible carried out his 
inspections at regular intervals and on the spot, both in respect of the 
industrial establishment itself and its associated book-keeping and other 
offices, and drew up a report which consisted not only of the failings which had 
been brought to light, but also proposals for possible reforms. The inspectors 
themselves possessed no rights of disposal whatever over the factories allocated 
to them, but merely submitted their reports to the competent organisational 
authorities. In the meantime, there soon arose forms of cooperation between the 
Inspectors, the Commissars of Production and the Works' Councils. The 
recommendations of the inspector were often quite spontaneously complied with. A 
journal was even published <i>The Inspectors Gazette</i>, which was distributed 
to all the disappropriated factories and made a considerable contribution 
towards clarifying organisational problems of works management amongst the 
workers themselves. The structure of systematic control extended not only to the 
factories but also into the sphere of competence of all Peoples' Commissariats." 
E. Varga <i>Die wirtschaftspolitischen Probleme der proletarischen Diktatur</i> 
pages 67-68.</p>

<p class="fst">What Varga here terms "control over production" is in fact the 
result of combining under one heading two completely separate functions. The one 
relates to control in the book-keeping sense - control over the account books. 
This is merely a matter of debit and credit. On the other hand, it also relates 
to the question of technical control; this concerns itself with the continual 
and ever-increasing rationalisation of production throughout all stages, with 
which is associated the achievement of the highest possible degree of efficiency 
in each productive establishment. With Varga both these fundamentally different 
functions are united in the one control authority, which for a communist economy 
is fundamentally wrong. This becomes self-evident - incidentally revealing the 
true character of the Hungarian Soviet Republic described by Varga - when it is 
considered that the system of control over the production process is clearly 
shown to consist of a combination of two disparate functions: on the one hand, 
rationalisation measures and, on the other, the recording of the results of 
those measures in book-keeping form. Control card systems, time-clocks, the 
Taylor system and an ever faster-moving production line form the milestones 
marking the progress of this system of rationalisation which is simultaneously a 
system of control - but one which serves a superior power to make effective its 
control over the labour which has been placed at its disposal. Under these 
conditions control of production means control over the producers, to determine 
if the results of their labour are sufficiently profitable, if they yield a 
sufficient surplus for the purposes of the commanding authority which lords it 
over the economy. This form of control bears the character of a system of 
domination over the producers.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">2. Objective Methods of Control</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The method of production control applicable in a society of free 
and equal producers is a fundamentally different one. There also measurements 
pertaining to work processes and mechanisation of the labour process, such as 
production lines, will exist, but now these will be technical measures for 
achieving and implementing the best working methods, desired and applied by the 
workers themselves in their respective productive establishments. This is the 
case, because, behind these measures, there stands not the whip wielded by the 
central commanding authority, which is motivated by the aim of achieving the 
greatest possible surplus, but the autonomous interests of the workers 
themselves, who with every increase in the productivity of labour simultaneously 
increase the total stock of useful articles available for society as a whole, to 
which stock all workers have an equal right. And it is here that the tasks 
discharged by the establishment responsible for social regulation and control 
over production begin. The system of social book-keeping, which of course is the 
clearing-house for all incomings and outgoings of the separate productive 
establishments, must keep watch over the incoming and outgoing stream of 
products, to ensure that these correspond with the productivity norms which have 
been determined for each respective productive establishment. Since under 
communism there can be no economic secrets, and since accordingly the reports 
issued periodically by the office of social-bookkeeping make publicly known the 
production situation at each separate productive establishment, the question of 
control is thereby solved. It simply ceases to be a problem.</p>

<p class="fst">Which organisations are responsible to intervene in the case of 
failures of, or departures from, the established procedures, and which decide 
the measures to be applied in such cases, represents a question in its own 
right; it properly belongs in the sphere of technical-organisational methods.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>THE SYSTEM OF CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION APPLICABLE IN A SOCIETY 
OF FREE AND EQUAL PRODUCERS IS THUS NOT DEPENDENT UPON SUBJECTIVE DECISIONS 
REACHED BY OFFICIALS AND AUTHORITIES, BUT IS MADE EFFECTIVE THROUGH THE PUBLIC 
REGISTRATION OF THE MOVEMENTS TAKING PLACE THROUGH, OR THE PROGRESS ACHIEVED BY, 
THE OBJECTIVE PRODUCTION PROCESS ITSELF; IN OTHER WORDS, <b>PRODUCTION IS 
CONTROLLED BY REPRODUCTION</b></i></p>

<p class="fst">We will now attempt to show by means of a schematic 
representation the precise form which the system of accounting control will 
take. Let us consider to begin with a process of production based upon average 
social production time. We have come to understand the concrete realisation of 
this category as a horizontal coordination of similar productive establishments. 
If we number the separate productive establishments belonging to a particular 
production group as Factory 1, Factory 2, Factory 3 ... and so on, to Factory N, 
and take the total of their production = t, then the following sum gives their 
total productivity:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">Factory 1 ... (p1 + c1) + X1 kg. Product<br>
<i>plus</i> Factory 2 ... (p2 + c2) + X2 kg. Product<br>
<i>plus</i> Factory 3 ... (p3 + c3) + X3 kg. Product<br>
<i>plus</i> Factory n ... (pn + cn) + Xn kg. Product</p>

<p class="fst"><i>equals</i></p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">Total Productivity (Pt + Ct) + Xt kg. Product</p>

<p class="fst">The average social production time per kilogram of product is 
thus:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">Average Social Production Time = (Pt + Ct) + Lt <i>divided by</i> 
Xt Kg Product.</p>

<p class="fst">Even in those cases in which a single productive establishment 
produces a variety of products, these can be readily calculated by means of the 
production cost factor applicable to each such product.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus the unit of Average Social Production Time (ASPT) is valid 
as the unit measure of productivity, and the productivity factor applicable to 
each establishment is determined by the degree of deviation from the average 
production time (see Chapter 4). Much other data can also be derived from the 
above formula, such as, for instance, the average social usage of P, C and L, 
which in itself already permits a certain amount of leeway in the comparative 
evaluation of the accuracy of the separate productivity factors. In this 
respect, therefore, the production group has no need of a State controller or 
auditor, because the factors requiring to be investigated lie within the sphere 
of competence of the united producers themselves. The unit of Average Social 
Production Time thus proves to be in itself a perfectly capable instrument of 
control at the disposal of the production cooperative as a whole.</p>

<p class="fst">The question must now be asked as to whether or not, when a 
production cooperative is formed, the producers must inevitably lose their right 
of control over production; in other words, whether or not a centralised group 
authority must as a matter of course arrogate to itself all power over 
production. Without doubt dangers are lurking here, since at any given moment 
there remain powerful tendencies inherited from the capitalist mode of 
production making for the concentration of powers of control in a central 
authority. In the instance of the production cooperative, for instance, attempts 
will almost certainly be made to vest authority over the application of the 
accumulation fund in the hands of a central management body. Should this ever 
actually come about, the separate productive organisations would no longer have 
any decision-making authority. It is also possible that an attempt will be made 
to establish such a central authority for each production group, which would 
then dispose of the right to distribute the incoming production tasks amongst 
the various associated establishments, as well as to hold control over the final 
product. The indigenous factory or works organisations would then become no more 
than the executive organs of the central administration, which would mean that 
for them only the maintenance of the system of book-keeping internal to the 
establishment would remain as their sole necessary task. To what extent matters 
might come to this would depend upon the degree of insight and energy brought to 
bear by the producers themselves. Certain it is that no progress will be 
possible without a sharp struggle against these tendencies. Whatever 
fine-sounding slogans may be bandied about, independent administration and 
control remain the mandatory demand from which the free producers must on no 
account depart.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus the productive establishment appears as an independent unit 
which cements its relations with other productive establishments and consumer 
cooperatives. In this way the producers hold full responsibility in their hands, 
and the necessary leeway is given within which independent initiatives may move 
and breathe, and for the creative energies springing from the liberated working 
masses to enjoy full scope. The significance of the system of horizontal 
coordination is thus no more than a matter of accounting control which is 
necessary for determining Average Social Production Time and, in association 
with this, the degree of productivity of the separate productive establishments 
comprising the cooperative. However, matters must not be permitted to remain 
static at that stage of development, but a process of mutual technical 
interpenetration and interdependence must also come to be established. However 
important in itself this process may be, it must nevertheless remain subordinate 
to the decisive and principled demand for independent control. And this is a 
matter concerning which we can agree with Leichter in affirming: "At first 
glance one will assume that each separate productive establishment is more or 
less independent; a moment one looks a little more closely, however, one will 
recognise quite clearly the umbilical cord which joins each separate productive 
establishment ... with the rest of the economy." However, the universal, 
all-regulating bond which in reality unites "each separate productive 
establishment with the rest of the economy" is <i>the formula for production and 
reproduction</i>. It is this which places all industrial establishments on the 
same foundation; production for the purpose of securing the conditions necessary 
for the reproduction of the economy represents the common foundation uniting all 
productive establishments.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">3. Control by Means of the Registration of the Stream of Products</a></h3>

<p class="fst">It is now necessary that we return for a while to the question of 
the social control of production:<br>
With the revolutionary transformation of social relations, private property in 
means of production is eliminated and these come into common ownership. The <i>
legal relationship</i> of the industrial organisations then becomes one in which 
the former then accept control over means of production in an administrative 
capacity. This means that the industrial organisations disclose their 
inventories and then indicate how they propose to deploy their means of 
production; what this amounts to is that they submit to the Office of Social 
Book-keeping a production budget drawn up in the form of (p + c) + L = X kg. 
product. The marxist demand for a system of social book-keeping then finds its 
realisation in the form of the totality of the production budget: "Their 
stock-book (i.e., society - the Authors) contains a list of the objects of 
utility that belong to them, of the operations necessary for their production; 
and lastly, of the labour-time that definite quantities of those objects have, 
on an average, cost them." (K. Marx: <i>Capital</i>, Vol. 1)</p>

<p class="fst">If the total social inventory is given in the form of the 
totality of the various production budgets, by this means it then becomes 
obvious that the various participating establishments are therewith brought 
under social control. Production in an industrial establishment is a continual 
process. On the one hand, as input, various products flow into the establishment 
(this includes labour-power), in order that, on the other hand, they may leave 
the establishment in a new form (output). Each such transformation of material 
values, however, is registered in the system of general social book-keeping, in 
the form of an entry of product exchange, and by this means a survey of 
incomings and outgoings, the debit and credit of any particular establishment, 
is readily available. Everything which is consumed by the establishment, such as 
means of production, raw materials or labour certificates, appears as an ingoing 
entry, and everything which is transferred to society appears as an outgoing. As 
continuous streams these two must correspond fully with each other, must cancel 
each other out. By this means an immediate check is at any time available as to 
whether or not, and to what degree, production is proceeding smoothly.</p>

<p class="fst">Should, for instance, an untoward surplus arise in any particular 
section of production, the office of social book-keeping is able at any moment 
to make an immediate report to the appropriate control instance (perhaps a joint 
production commission). It is not possible for the surplus to have arisen as a 
result of the relevant industrial establishment, at the time of the delivery of 
the product, having calculated more than the correct Average Social Production 
Time, since the latter has been made public knowledge. It must therefore be due 
to an error in the production budget. Should it be verified that it is indeed 
here that the error actually lies, then the fact has simultaneously been 
ascertained that the establishment concerned has been operating at a higher 
level of productivity than had been estimated in the production budget; its 
productivity factor will consequently be revised in an upwards direction.</p>

<p class="fst">The opposite can also occur. The system of social book-keeping 
reveals a deficit in the output of a certain industrial establishment. This 
leads in exactly the same way to a revision of the productivity factor and the 
separate production elements, p, c or L of this establishment. The extent to 
which these may work against the wider interests of society can be determined by 
means of the formula:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center"><u>(pt + ct) + Lt</u><br>
Xt</p>

<p class="fst">in association with the establishment's production budget.</p>

<p class="fst">Out of this simple system of control based on social 
book-keeping, which proceeds quite automatically as a necessary consequence of 
the production process itself, there arises yet a further agency of control 
which is quite remorseless and inflexible in its operation: the reproduction 
process. If we assume a case in which a productive unit has calculated its 
Average Social Production Time at too low a level, then we have a situation in 
which the over-productive establishments are able to make reproduction 
effective, but they are not in a position to make good the deficit of the 
under-productive ones. These latter, then find themselves unable to carry 
through reproduction, and it becomes necessary that society intervene and make 
good the missing resources out of the GSU budget for the period during which the 
true figure for Average Social Production Time is being newly computed from the 
available data.</p>

<p class="fst">Conversely, should a surplus arise in one or a number of 
establishments as a result of the application of too high a figure of Average 
Social Production Time, no very considerable passage of time will be needed 
before such an error is brought to light; on the contrary, it will be revealed 
relatively speedily, precisely because the system is one in which two opposite 
streams, an ingoing and an outgoing, an input and an output are measured in 
relation to one another. Over periods of time of given duration, these two must 
exactly correspond and cancel each other out, whilst over shorter periods this 
is so only within certain limits - limits which may be relatively easily 
determined through practice; in all cases, however, the system of automatic 
control is brought into play through the system of reproduction.</p>

<p class="fst">Insofar as we have through these observations carried out an 
examination showing how it is possible for the system of social book-keeping to 
have at its command an immediate general survey of the production process, we 
will now proceed to gain an insight into the means whereby it is able to place 
under its control the other distinct categories of the production formula also.</p>

<p class="fst">To begin with, control over the category labour-power, 
represented by the letter L in the production formula, is made effective by very 
simple means. The issuing of labour certificates is accepted by the industrial 
establishment in question only in respect of that labour-power which has been 
directly expended on its own behalf. If we consider that the production budgets 
are also maintained by the office of social book-keeping, then the following 
points are immediately revealed: 1) whether or not the amounts revealed as 
having been expended in respect of labour certificates issued lie within the 
limits imposed by the budget; or 2) whether or not the relationship of the 
labour certificates issued to the quantities either of raw materials consumed or 
of end-product delivered corresponds with that indicated in the production 
budget. It is, for instance, already known how many tonnes of, say, coal will be 
produced per miner, that is to say how many directly expended labour-hours 
accrue to any one unit of production.</p>

<p class="fst">Effective control over means of production is in some degree more 
difficult, because in this case a distinction must be made between <i>fixed</i> 
and <i>circulating</i> means of production. It is a well understood principle 
that the circulating means are absorbed fully into the product whilst the fixed 
means are absorbed only partially at any given time. Exactly the same use-values 
can however in the one case appear under the category p and in another under the 
category c. In a case in which a productive establishment has consumed certain 
use-values, then the question arises for the office of social book-keeping as to 
whether that particular entry should have been placed under category p or 
category c. It would not be appropriate to indicate here just how this question 
should be solved, since the solution belongs in the sphere of specialised 
book-keeping technique. The difficulty would, for instance, be eliminated if it 
were to be adopted as a rule that, a note were to be attached to the order 
indicating whether the item in question was to be entered under p or c, in much 
the same way as, at present, it is customary to indicate with cheque payments or 
money transfers the purpose for which the transfer has been made.</p>

<p class="fst">This, however, is not our concern but that of the office of 
social book-keeping. For our purposes it is sufficient that the categories 
comprising the production formula (p + c) + L may be given their appropriate 
registration smoothly and without hindrance, so that in this way each may be 
supervised and controlled separately whenever necessary. The category c in 
particular moves only within the limits set by the production budget and must 
stand in correct relationship to the category L as well as to the end product 
produced. Any wasteful expenditure of raw materials can thus be uncovered, not 
only by the production sector concerned, but also by the system of social 
book-keeping.</p>

<p class="fst">If we now consider the category p, we find that it is here that 
we encounter a difficulty. Such items as machinery, buildings, etc., are 
absorbed into the product only after a period of some 10 to 20 years, whilst at 
the same time they are maintained during this period in a utilisable condition 
by means of maintenance work, repairs, etc. If we assume an average depreciation 
period of ten years, then a tenth of the total production duration is written 
off each year; that is to say, it is entered each year into the formula (p + c) 
+ L. After delivery of the finished manufactured product, L and c once again 
enter fully into the production formula; p however remains to the credit of the 
industrial establishment concerned. Only after ten years have passed have the 
fixed means of production been wholly depreciated and become once again due for 
renewal.</p>

<p class="fst">From this it would appear at first sight as if control over p can 
only be made effective after 10 years, that it is only then that it can be 
determined whether p has been evaluated at too high or too low a level. This 
however is only the appearance. The actual production process is characterised, 
amongst other things, by the fact that the various machines and other plant have 
differing depreciation periods, and also by the fact that the precise moments in 
time at which they were placed into service are all different. Thus in any given 
year old means of production are being replaced by new ones at differing times. 
For this reason it is not only the categories L and c which move as a continuous 
stream through the productive establishment, but also p, even if at a slower 
tempo. In this way it is shown that each productive establishment will need to 
have employed in one year approximately the full amount of p which has been 
written off as depreciation.</p>

<p class="fst">If we now consider briefly the character of the system of social 
control, then it is to be noted that, as far as the productive establishments 
are concerned, in respect of a number of different categories, production in 
fact controls itself. In the first place, the fact as to whether or not the 
production budget (p + c) + L has in general been correctly computed and as to 
whether or not each separate category has moved within the limits designated by 
the budget represent indices that can be immediately ascertained. In the second 
place, control is exercised over the quantity of products produced; the result 
manifests itself as a control over the average production time effective in the 
production establishment concerned, and also over the average production time 
applicable in society as a whole. Out of the ratio of the former to the latter 
there thus also arises yet a further integer: in this case one providing control 
over the productivity factor.</p>

<p class="fst">The entire process of control therefore consists in nothing other 
than that of the various transfers of use-values and the acceptance of labour 
certificates for issue, <i>that is to say the objective process of production 
itself</i>, provides a check upon, and so controls, the production formula. Next 
we have the end product produced, the result of the objective process of 
production. This subjects the individual factory or works average, the overall 
social average and the resultant indicated productivity to open scrutiny by the 
whole of society. In addition to this, an effective control is brought to bear 
upon each of the categories separately making up the formula (p + c) + L, as a 
result of the entry into account of quantities representing labour certificates 
issued and transfers of use-values produced - that is to say, through the 
objective course of the production process itself. Finally, the reproduction 
process (extended accumulation), which represents and embraces <i>objective 
production as a whole</i>, maintains an accurate final or subsequent means of 
control.</p>

<p class="fst">In those cases in which Average Social Production Time has been 
calculated at too low a level, the production cooperative concerned will be 
unable to carry through reproduction; in those cases, on the other hand, in 
which it has been calculated at too high a level, surpluses will be revealed 
which it will not be possible to absorb through current production.</p>
