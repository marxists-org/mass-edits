<h1><a name="h0">Average Social Production Time as the Basis for Distribution</a></h1>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">1. The Distribution of the Product According to Leichter</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Even though it may have been Leichter's achievement to have 
tackled for the first time and in a serious way the question of social 
regulation and accounting control on the basis of average social labour-time, he 
nevertheless fails to bring the various problems to a satisfactory conclusion. 
The main reason for this is that his approach to the question of the 
distribution of the social product remains wholly within the sphere of influence 
of capitalist modes of thought. It is self-evident that an antagonistic mode of 
distribution of the product has as its essential precondition a system of 
domination over the producers, and this in its turn provides the basis for 
Leichter's concept of a central organ of administration and management. Thus it 
is possible to characterise Leichter's attempts in this field as being based 
upon the conception that the foundations of communism do indeed rest upon a 
system of production which is controlled by average social labour-time, but one 
in which this is also administered from above. If indeed we have already 
demonstrated Leichter's belief that exploitation can in no way be avoided, in 
the same way we will now go on to prove the necessary corollary of this, namely, 
that the producer must of necessity lose every right of disposal over the system 
of production. <i>And all this arises simply because he is unable to accept the 
average social hour of labour as the unit measure regulating distribution as 
well as production</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">In a society characterised by specialisation of labour, the 
producers must receive a permit authorising the consumption of goods socially 
produced but destined for individual consumption. In this respect these 
authorisations fulfil the same function as money under capitalism. 
Intrinsically, however, this is simply worthless material; it may be paper, 
aluminium or any other stuff.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> The worker receives in the form of these 
permits just so much as corresponds with the actual labour-hours expended. In 
common parlance, these permits are called "labour money", although it does not 
constitute money in the capitalist sense. Without for the moment involving 
ourselves in complex theoretical observations, we may state that this "labour 
money" corresponds fully with marxist concepts:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"On this point I will only say further that Owen's 
'labour-money', for instance, is no more 'money' than a theatre ticket is. Owen 
presupposes directly socialised labour, a form of production diametrically 
opposed to the production of commodities. The certificate of labour is merely 
evidence of the part taken by the individual in the common labour, and of his 
claim to a certain portion of the common product which has been set aside for 
consumption."<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Leichter in his observations also proposes this "labour-money" as 
the basis for distribution. He writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In reality the social plan proposed by Bourguin, as also that 
presented here, are both based on the concept of a distribution of goods in kind 
relative to the labour expended by each individual. Labour money is only a 
particular form for determining the share in the national product selected for 
specifically economic reasons."<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Although these observations of Leichter's appear to be quite 
faultless, there lurks nevertheless a poisonous adder in the grass, and this 
becomes apparent when he writes about "distribution in relation to the labour 
performed by each individual". Production is indeed organised on the basis of 
the average social hour of labour, but according to him distribution proceeds on 
the basis of quite different principles. In reality the producers shall have 
allocated to them products in exchange for their labour-power on the basis of 
norms which have absolutely nothing to do with any system of labour-time 
accounting. On the contrary, it is the social statistician and the subsistence 
physiologist who should determine the quantity and quality of life necessities 
which the human individual needs for the maintenance of life, and it is they who 
"fix a definite number of labour-hours which correspond approximately to the 
minimum necessary for existence" (page 64). It is by this means that the 
"standard scientifically estimated and balanced ration of life necessities" 
(page 64) is determined. This minimum ration, reflecting a physiological 
subsistence norm, then becomes the basis for payment. What possible connection 
is there between this and the system of labour-time accounting in production?<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The answer, of course, is that this minimum is intended for 
unskilled workers, whereas the "wage" of the "trained" and "skilled" workers is 
fixed at a somewhat higher rate by means of negotiated agreements. These 
collective agreements determine the basic wage, whilst "the socialist factory 
manager ... fixes the payment received by the separate workers" (page 64), 
according to their various capabilities.</p>

<p class="fst">It is clear that the producers can never feel that their factory 
is a part of their very selves when such contradictions exist between them. For 
that reason they can never bear the responsibility for the production process, 
something which Leichter knows full well. For this reason, in his conception it 
is not the producers themselves who exercise responsibility, not the works 
organisation as a productive whole, but it is <i>the director</i>. Leichter 
writes: "The director of the factory, however appointed, bears the sole 
responsibility for it; he can be summarily dismissed, just like a capitalist 
factory manager who fails to live up to the demands placed upon him. Should he 
then be unemployed, he receives the minimum income guaranteed by society, or 
else he is employed in an appropriately inferior, and for that reason lower 
paid, position. In this way it is possible to maintain standards of 'individual 
initiative' and a sense of responsibility - qualities which also affect personal 
self-interest - amongst the capitalist factory managers and directors, and so to 
place them at the disposal of the socialist economy" (page 101). All that is 
quite explicit. Leichter's conception is that the threat of relegation to a 
subsistence minimum based upon physiological or "minimum living standard" norms 
should hang over the heads of the producers like the sword of Damocles.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>Thus we see that in this case also the organisational 
structure of production is determined by the foundations on which distribution 
stands</i>. The workers have come into irreconcilable contradiction with the 
factory administration, and all this has happened because the workers have 
failed to ensure that their relation to the social product is determined by the 
labour which they contribute.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us now turn our attention to the prices of products as 
Leichter conceives them. Although we would have expected that in this case at 
least the social average production time would have been valid as the 
determinative basis for the prices of products, we find that in fact this is by 
no means the case. In this matter Leichter is extremely vague, but nevertheless 
it is clearly apparent that the products make their way into social exchange <i>
with a higher price attached to them</i>. He speaks, for instance, of a profit 
increment, but shows that it is his intention that this should accrue, not to 
the factory, but to the general social fund - the equivalent in Leichter's 
scheme to a capitalist "treasury" or "exchequer". It is from this profit 
increment that the general fund makes available the means for the enlargement of 
the productive base of the industrial establishments. This fund therefore 
reveals itself to be <i>an accumulation fund</i>. We will return shortly to the 
question of this accumulation fund, but would first like to make it clear that, 
with Leichter also, production time finds no expression in the "price" of 
products. The truth then emerges - namely, that the "central management and 
administration of the productive system" in fact fixes the prices. In short, 
they conduct a <i>price policy</i>, in order amongst other things to obtain the 
means for accumulation. The central administration, which exercises the right of 
disposal over the product, thus has the power in its hands to exploit the 
producers as they see fit. Because of the lack of an exact relationship of the 
producer to the product, because of a presence of a "price policy", 
capitalist-type wage relations remain in force.</p>

<p class="fst">As is well known, marxist political economy defines three 
categories of wages in capitalist production: 1. the nominal wage; 2. the real 
or actual wage; 3. the relative wage.</p>

<p class="fst">The <i><b>NOMINAL WAGE</b></i> is the <i>money price</i> of 
labour-power. Under that type of communism based upon the statistically derived 
physiological or "minimum living standard" subsistence minimum, this is to be 
understood as the equivalent number of labour-hours which the worker receives as 
payment for the actual number of labour-hours, for instance 40, worked.</p>

<p class="fst">The <i><b>REAL OR ACTUAL WAGE</b></i> is equivalent to the 
quantity of products which can be realised in exchange for the nominal wage. 
Although the nominal wage may remain constant, the actual wage will be higher if 
the prices of products fall whilst it will fall if those prices rise. With 
Leichter, the central administration pursues a "price policy" which as a matter 
of course is assumed to be in the interests of the producers. But this does not 
in any way alter the fact that it is that authority which in reality determines 
the actual wage, in spite of any and all "collective agreements" reached, since 
these relate only to the nominal wage. Over all this the producer has no power 
whatsoever, because the right of control over the price policy is reserved for 
the gentlemen of the "Statistical Bureau".</p>

<p class="fst">The <i><b>RELATIVE WAGE</b></i> is defined by the relationship of 
the real wage to the gross capitalist profit. Thus it is possible that the real 
wage remains constant whilst the relative wage falls on account of a rise in the 
gross mass of profits realised. Here Leichter places the main emphasis upon the 
"rationalisation" of industrial establishments. This has its source in the 
striving after higher productivity, the creation of a continuously increasing 
surplus product with the same labour-power - in other words, the average social 
labour-time necessary for the production of commodities falls continuously. With 
Leichter, the objective relationship of the producer to the product is not 
determined in the production process itself. He is only capable of conceiving 
only of a kind of intelligent labour machine which is nourished on the basis of 
a statistically derived physiological or "minimum standard living" subsistence 
minimum, a machine which, in spite of the increase in the mass of products which 
its labour has created, nevertheless needs to receive no extra calories or other 
input of life necessities whatsoever. Or, alternatively, perhaps the labour 
machines do after all receive some part of the increased wealth, but even if 
this is so, it is in spite of the fact that not the slightest guarantee is given 
of this ever actually happening. The essential point here is that, under a 
system of labour-time computation, the owner-controllers of the production 
system, the workers themselves, exercise a complete right of disposal over the 
increased mass of products produced.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus it can be demonstrated that the category of social average 
labour-time is meaningless if it does not simultaneously function as the 
foundation of distribution. If the relationship of the producers to their 
product is directly anchored in the products themselves, then no leeway exists 
for a "price policy", and the fruits of each and every improvement in the 
productive system accrue directly and automatically to all consumers without any 
need for anyone to "decree" this administratively. The fact that, with Leichter, 
the three capitalist wage categories can be shown to exist proves that <i>his 
production plan</i>, <i>just like capitalism itself</i>, <i>also rests upon 
exploitation</i>.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">2. Varga's State Communism as a Factor in Distribution</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Leichter, however, is not the only one to seek his salvation in a 
"price policy": Varga also makes this the centre of gravity in a communist 
system of distribution. He differs only from his colleagues Neurath, Leichter, 
etc. only insofar as he approves in principle of a system of equal distribution 
of the social product. In the transitional period, it will not be possible to 
eliminate exploitation immediately, because we must expect that "a generation of 
workers would for a time exist which has been corrupted by capitalism, which has 
been brought up under the shadow of an acquisitive and egotistical 
capitalism",<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> and would set its face against an equal distribution of the 
social product. It is well-known that skilled workers tend to view unskilled 
workers with a certain contempt, whilst a perverted sense of justice tends to 
allot to the scions of the intellectual professions, such as doctors, engineers, 
etc., a larger share of the total product than that which accrues to the 
"ordinary" workers. Today one may consider this differentiation to be too 
extreme, but ... "an engineer nevertheless remains something different from a 
dustman"! To what extent the working class may in the course of the revolution 
come to discard this ideologically bolstered excrescence remains to be seen. One 
thing, however, remains certain: once the revolution is complete, this 
re-education must be carried through very swiftly, since an antagonistic mode of 
distribution of the product will always lead to rivalries and quarrels within 
the working class itself.</p>

<p class="fst">In the above mentioned text Varga has set down his experiences 
and theoretical observations concerning the Hungarian Soviet Republic. The 
history of Hungary is extremely important to the study of a communist economy, 
because it was here that the theory of state communism was first put into 
practice and that practice than hallowed as theory. In Hungary the attempt was 
made to construct communism according to the rules of the state-communist 
concept, and indeed under such favourable conditions that "the transformation 
and organisational restructuring of the economy proceeded faster and with 
greater energy in Hungary than in Russia itself" (Varga, page 78). Economic 
construction, indeed, proceeded according to the Hilferdingian vision of a 
"general cartel" (page 122), in which the State, as general manager and 
administrator of both production and distribution, enjoys the full right of 
disposal over all products. All commodities still produced in the "free" 
capitalist sector of the economy are now bought up by the State, whereupon the 
latter does indeed enjoy complete domination over the social product.</p>

<p class="fst">In the case of distribution, it was at first the pressing need to 
supply industry with raw materials and means of production which imposed itself 
as an urgent necessity. For this purpose the Supreme Economic Council had 
established a number of central distribution points for raw materials, which 
then allocated to the factories whatever quantities of raw materials and other 
means of production as seemed necessary and expedient to them. These central 
distribution points were, however, by no means simply organs of distribution; 
they operated simultaneously as instruments of political and economic power, 
since they consciously sought to promote the concentration of production through 
their control of materials supply. Factories which "higher authority" had 
decided to close down were simply cut off from the source of supply of essential 
materials, whereupon the operating staff were thrown onto the street. There is 
first hand evidence to show that the workers fought against such a process of 
concentration, which held the same fateful consequences for them as it did under 
capitalism. The very practice taught them the lesson that the producers held no 
rights of disposal over the system of production. This right remained in the 
hands of the state officials of the Supreme Economic Council, which later thus 
comes into irreconcilable conflict with the producers themselves (E. Varga: 
ibid., p. 71).</p>

<p class="fst">To this we would add the comment that concentration "from above 
downwards" apparently enjoys the virtue of being carried through more quickly 
than that "from below upwards", but the price to be paid for this accelerated 
development is the power the producers would otherwise wield over the system of 
production, that is to say: communism itself!</p>

<p class="fst">We have already noted that state communism of the Varga brand 
knows nothing of any economic scale of measurement determining the distribution 
of raw materials and means of production. The allocation of materials needed by 
industry for current production is carried out solely "by order of the relevant 
authorities" and is in no way determined objectively by the process of 
production itself. From the point of view of both social and economic policy, 
industrial production thus leads to a total fiasco. In social policy, because 
producers end up in a situation of total dependence upon those authorities which 
allocate the products; in economic policy, because under a system of 
distribution based upon subjective administrative assessments the needs of 
reproduction are not guaranteed. Varga is thus in essence a "commodity manager", 
who in the last analysis tends towards the system of centralised production and 
distribution advocated by Neurath, one which operates without any unit of 
economic control. Indeed he states that "for the time being the need for money 
prices and money wages exists", but is forced to add that this has to be 
overcome through a more plentiful production of goods. But then there remains 
absolutely no objective measure by means of which the growing productivity of 
the production apparatus may be evaluated. True planned production on any real 
basis then ceases, and it becomes impossible to measure and allocate as much 
product for the next production period as was used up in the previous one - 
i.e., to ensure even simple reproduction.</p>

<p class="fst">To overcome the chaos of state communism of the Varga variety, it 
would finally have become necessary to have established production upon the firm 
foundation of a unit of control, which by the very nature of the situation could 
have been nothing other than that of the average social hour of labour. But this 
would simultaneously have brought to an end any system based upon arbitrary 
allocation of the social product according to subjective administrative 
decision. As soon as the factories introduce a system by means of which their 
consumption is calculated in terms of labour-hours, according to the formula (p 
+ c) + L, then the system becomes one in which the objective process of 
production itself determines how much product in the form of means of production 
and raw materials must be supplied to the factories for the next production 
period. With this system, the subjective element is eliminated along with the 
centralised power of disposal over the production apparatus, because management 
and administration of both production and distribution lie in the hands of the 
producers.</p>

<p class="fst">In Varga's system, the norms determining the distribution of 
products for individual consumption also reflect allocation according to 
subjective administration decision. Indeed, we cannot expect anything different, 
since production and distribution are functionally interconnected. The ideal 
which drifts vaguely before his eyes is "natural" allocation (i.e., by barter) 
without any economic measure, in exactly the same way as in the objective 
process of production. It is for this reason that he establishes for all 
consumers a fixed ration for the various staple products, which can then be 
obtained at consumers' cooperatives. "Since, however, money wages and money 
prices must for the time being remain in operation", we must now turn our 
attention to the problem of "the fixing of prices by the state" (Varga, page 
147):</p>

<p class="quoteb">"At what level should the prices of state products be fixed? If 
goods produced by state enterprises were to be sold at cost price, there would 
be no economic resources available for maintaining the above-mentioned 
unproductive sections of the population. (This refers to military personnel, 
officials, teachers, the unemployed, the sick, invalids, etc. - the Authors). 
Also there would be no possibility of any real accumulation of means of 
production, which in the proletarian state is more urgently needed for the 
purpose of raising the standard of living of the inhabitants than in a 
capitalist one. It is for this reason that, in principle, all goods produced by 
state establishments should be sold at the 'social cost price'. By this we mean <i>
the cost price plus an additional increment to cover the cost of maintaining the 
non-productive section of the population</i>, <i>plus yet a further increment 
out of which real accumulation may be financed</i>. (Varga's emphasis). 
Expressed otherwise, selling prices must be fixed in such a way that the state 
not only suffers no deficit, but actually disposes over a surplus out of which 
new productive installations may be financed. This, in principle, is the 
solution." (E. Varga: ibid., p. 147)</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">3. The Domination of the Producers by the Production Apparatus</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The practice of "price fixing" resolves itself therefore into one 
in which the State conducts a "price policy". It is without doubt Varga's 
intention that this should be a class policy, which is why he then proposes a 
low price rating for products which are of considerable importance to the 
workers, such as bread and sugar, and a correspondingly higher rating for luxury 
products. It should be noted, however, that he considers these variations to 
have more a propagandist than an economic significance, since he knows perfectly 
well that the vast sums swallowed up by the State must in the last analysis come 
from the masses, i.e. from the proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">This "class policy", however well-intentioned it may be, in fact 
reveals the entire rottenness of the state-communist method of distribution. It 
demonstrates very clearly that the producer has <i>not</i> -as through the very 
act of labour the producer <i>should have</i> - simultaneously determined a 
share in the social product, but that this share has been fixed in the higher 
echelons of the administration through subjective administrative decisions. As a 
result of this, the old political struggles for government posts are continued 
in a new form. The fact is brought quite clearly to light that whoever disposes 
of political power in the State at the same time holds the totality of the 
social product and, through the instrumentality of the "prices policy", 
dominates distribution. It is nothing but the old struggle for positions of 
power, which is fought on the backs of the labouring consumers. If, 
additionally, we bear in mind that wages also are fixed by the Supreme Economic 
Council (E. Varga: ibid, page 75), then the picture of state communist mass 
slavery is complete. The central administration of production has complete power 
to nullify any increase of wages achieved through struggle by means of their 
prices policy. Along with this, we also see that, with the construction of the 
state-communist system, the working class has laboured to create a system of 
production which then raises itself above and against the producers, and it 
grows into a vast engine of oppression against which it is even more difficult 
to struggle than it is against the capitalist system itself.</p>

<p class="fst">This relationship of rulers to ruled is given its appropriate 
disguise through the democratic forms assumed by the distributive organisations. 
For instance, on the 20th of March 1919 a Decree was issued in Russia which made 
it compulsory for the entire Russian population to be organised in consumer 
cooperatives:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"All those cooperatives which exercised a certain independence 
within their sphere of operations were then amalgamated into one organic whole, 
whilst the consumers controlled the process of distribution through their 
meetings and congresses; they were 'masters in their own house'. Although the 
initiating force behind the formation of consumer cooperatives and their 
amalgamation was the state, after the formation of the organisation the 
responsibility for the distribution of products was left to the population at 
large."<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">According to the <i>Russian Correspondence</i> we are supposed to 
believe that it was solely through the organisational labour of the State that 
this colossal apparatus of distribution was set up within as brief a period as 5 
months!</p>

<p class="fst">One thing however is certain: the dictatorship of the Communist 
Party in Russia has in this respect carried out a gigantic task, and has 
provided a glowing example of how consumers can erect their apparatus of 
distribution within a relatively short space of time. However, even if it be 
true that the consumers are "masters in their own house", the question as to how 
life under communism is to be conducted, and in particular how the relationship 
of the producer to the product is to be determined, <i>is not decided there</i>. 
These decisions are taken in the central government offices. The consumers may 
then distribute the product "independently" - provided, of course, that their 
"independence" is restrained to a sufficient degree to make it conform with the 
norms laid down by the price policy!</p>

distribution for personal consumption takes place according to the same equal 
scale for each category of producer, and that, likewise, the benefits of rising 
labour productivity are passed onto each such category equally. As <i>
Fundamental Principles of Communist Production and Distribution</i> clearly 
shows, it is by means of a system in which the conditions of distribution are 
determined by the conditions of production, and by such a system alone, that 
this aim can pertain as a natural and organic element of the entire economic 
process. The sole instrumentality through which this can be achieved is the 
wholly objective and impartial unit of distribution for purposes of individual 
consumption represented by the Average Social Hour of Labour.</p>
