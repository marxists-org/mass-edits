<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">1. The Disciples of Marx</a></h3>

<p class="fst">A survey of the literature of socialism or communism, otherwise 
so rich, shows that only an extremely meagre body of work has been written 
concerning the economic foundations of that form of society which it is intended 
should replace capitalism. With Marx we find the classical analysis of the 
capitalist mode of production, which concludes with the statement that, through 
the development of the productive forces, humanity has placed before it the 
choice either to abolish private ownership of the means of production, in order 
then to continue production on the basis of social ownership, or - to sink into 
barbarism. This great scientific achievement lifted socialism out of the realm 
of utopia and placed it on the firm ground of scientific thought. Concerning the 
economic foundations of communism, however, Marx gave us only a few signposts 
showing us by what means they could be laid. In this connection it is his 
Marginal Notes, known as the <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i>, which are 
especially significant. This wish not to treat of the question at any greater 
length, to give us only a few pointers, does not however represent any kind of 
fault in the body of Marxist theory, for to have unfolded these questions for 
full examination would in his time almost certainly have been premature. Such a 
beginning would almost certainly have ended in utopia, and it was for this 
reason that Marx himself warned against it. And so this problem has become to 
some extent a fruit from the tree of forbidden knowledge, and this it has 
remained to some extent even to this day, in spite of the fact that the Russian 
Revolution has proved that it is precisely at this historical juncture that it 
must be solved.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In addition to defining the general foundations of the new system 
of production, Marx also indicated the method of social regulation and 
accounting control which would find application in the new society, and which we 
describe as accounting according to average social labour-time. The precondition 
for the establishment of the general foundations of communism were that money 
and the market must completely disappear, and that the disciples of Marx, 
insofar as they concerned themselves at all with the foundations of communist 
production, did not proceed any further than this. In communism they saw 
fundamentally nothing other than a continuation of the concentration of economic 
resources as we have known this under capitalism, which would then bring 
communism into being quite spontaneously. This outlook is revealed most clearly 
in the case of Hilferding, who subjects to examination the consequences of a 
total concentration of capital in the hands of one single owner. He draws the 
imaginary picture of a mammoth trust and describes this in the following words:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The whole of capitalist production would then be consciously 
regulated by a single body which would determine the volume of production in all 
branches of industry. Price determination would become a purely nominal matter, 
involving only the distribution of the total product between the cartel magnates 
on one side and all the other members of society on the other. Price would then 
cease to become the outcome of factual relationships into which people have 
entered, and would become a mere accounting device by which things would be 
allocated among people. Money would have no role. In fact, it could well 
disappear completely, since the task to be accomplished would be the allocation 
of things, not the distribution of values. The illusion of the objective value 
of the commodity would disappear along with the anarchy of production, and money 
itself would cease to exist. The cartel would distribute the product. The 
material elements of production would be reproduced and used in new production. 
A part of the output would be distributed to the working class and the 
intellectuals, while the rest would be retained by the cartel to use as it saw 
fit. This would be a consciously regulated society, but in an antagonistic form. 
This antagonism, however, would express itself in the sphere of distribution, 
which itself would be consciously regulated and hence able to dispense with 
money. In its perfected form finance-capital is thus uprooted from the soil 
which nourished its beginnings. The circulation of money has become unnecessary, 
the ceaseless turnover of money has attained its goal in the regulated society, 
and the <i>perpetuum mobile</i> of circulation finds its ultimate resting 
place."<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">According to this theory, the development towards communism is an 
unproblematical matter. It is an automatic and contradictionless process, which 
capitalism itself completes. Capitalist competition leads to the concentration 
of capital, and by these means large aggregations develop in industry. Within 
such an aggregation - for instance, a trust which combines transport, mining, 
rolling mills, etc., in one integrated economic community - a sphere of 
distribution without money develops. The higher management simply decides to 
which factory the new means of production (extended reproduction) are to be 
delivered, what and how much is to be produced, etc. According to this theory 
the problem of communist production is fundamentally nothing other than the 
further implementation of this kind of concentration, which then leads to 
communism quite spontaneously. Private ownership of the means of production will 
be superseded, for the simple reason it becomes a hindrance to the further 
combination of industrial establishments. With its elimination the process of 
concentration can develop to the full and nothing then stands in the way of 
combining the whole of economic life into one mammoth trust, which is then 
administered <i>from above</i>. The preconditions which Marx laid down for a 
communist society would thereby have been fulfilled. The market will have 
disappeared, because one single concern does not sell to or buy from itself. The 
prices attached to products also then vanish, whilst the higher administration 
directs the stream of products from one industrial unit to another, according to 
what they find to be expedient. That it should ever have been thought necessary 
to measure how much labour each product embodies was obviously a naive error 
committed by Marx and Engels.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus the course of development taken by the science which 
concerns itself with the communist economy does not assume the form of a 
straight line, but takes, after Marx, a different direction, to return to its 
former classic position only at around 1920. In this connection, it is surely a 
bitter irony that it was precisely the bourgeois economists who unintentionally 
helped the science of communism to take a generous step forward in its own 
development. At a time when it seemed as if the downfall of capitalism was 
within foreseeable reach and that communism was on the point of taking the world 
by storm, Max Weber and Ludwig Mises began to develop their criticism of 
communism. They were of course able to relate that criticism only to the 
Hilferdingian brand of 'socialism' and - what is essentially the same thing - 
Russian 'communism', whilst Neurath, the thoroughgoing disciple of Hilferding, 
was compelled to suffer the consequences of this. Their criticism concluded by 
demonstrating that an economy without any means of regulation or accounting 
control, without a general denominator by means of which to measure the value of 
products, is an impossibility. And indeed their shot had found the right mark. 
The result was considerable despondency and confusion in the 'Marxist' camp. In 
the field of economic science the impossibility of communism had been proven, 
simply on the grounds that, in the case of such an economy, each and every form 
of planned production would have ceased. Communism, which sought to prove its 
very right to exist precisely on the basis of the anarchy of capitalist 
production, showed itself to be even less amenable to a planned mode of 
operation than capitalism! Block then added his voice by saying their could be 
no question of communism before it had been demonstrated what means of control 
was to replace the "market mechanism". Even Kautsky lost his composure and so 
arrived at the most non-sensical proposals, such as fixing of prices over long 
periods, etc. These wild somersaults of Kautsky's nevertheless has a positive 
content, in that, through them, the necessity for a system of social regulation 
and accounting control became recognised, even if Kautsky did then conceive of 
this coming into being on the basis of present-day money. He believed that money 
would be indispensable "as a measure of value for book keeping purposes and as a 
method of keeping account of exchange relations in a socialist society", as well 
as "a means of circulation". (K. Kautsky: <i>The Proletarian Revolution and its 
programme</i>, p. 318).</p>

<p class="fst">The destructive criticism of communism wrought by Weber and Mises 
had in reality the effect of helping the study of communist economy over its 
moment of inertia and to place it on real foundations. It was they who summoned 
to life those intellectual forces which from that moment on have allowed 
themselves no further rest, since it was from that moment that it became 
possible to pursue further the Marxist method of thought in relation to the 
concept of the average social hour of labour.</p>

<p class="fst">As an opposite pole to that of state communism, various 
syndicalist currents began to appear around the year 1910, which sought to 
continue capitalist production through "syndicates", "industrial unions" or 
"guilds". These would then distribute their profits amongst the workers, or 
profits would be allowed to accumulate in a central social fund. This form of 
'communism' was never subjected to any theoretical elaboration, unless we can 
consider as such the work of Otto Leichter entitled <i>Economic Regulation and 
Control in a Socialist Society</i> which was published in Vienna in 1923. This 
study is based in general upon the method of social regulation and accounting 
control founded upon labour-time computation, and is without doubt the best 
effort hitherto produced in this field. The theory of autonomous economic 
administration at the hands of the producer-consumers themselves here takes a 
good stride forwards. In it, the problems are posed quite truthfully, although 
in our view Leichter fails to develop them to a satisfactory solution. He also 
declares that, before him, Maurice Bourguin had sought to place the communist 
economy on the foundation of accounting control on the basis of labour-time 
expended, and according to Leichter the latter's methods of thought corresponded 
almost exactly with his own. There were, in addition, various other Marxist 
economists who recognised the necessity for accounting control in a communist 
economy to be effected through labour-hours, although none of these adopted the 
means of production as a category in their method of accounting. For instance 
Varga, in <i>Communism</i>, Year 2, issue 9-10, published an article on this 
theme. Needless to say, because of the above-mentioned error the result is 
valueless.</p>

<p class="fst">It is however not only in the sphere of economic science that 
progress can be seen in the definition of the problem, but also in the sphere of 
the political factors. The economic experts consider communism only from the 
standpoint of production and distribution. The revolutionary proletariat, 
however, in reality pursues other motives. The extent to which state communism 
is economically viable or not is for it fairly irrelevant. For this reason it 
too rejects it, because practice has proved that the productive apparatus can be 
taken into <i>social ownership</i> whilst still continuing to function as an 
exploitative apparatus. The Russian revolution, for instance, has indeed 
revealed the problem in this political light.</p>

<p class="fst">Were we to enquire as to what positive ideas and conceptions are 
today in circulation within the revolutionary proletariat concerning the new 
communist economy, then we would find that the idea of autonomous administration 
and management is fairly well developed, but that any closer indication as to 
how this is to be realised is lacking. Nevertheless everyone now believes that 
it is absolutely necessary to achieve clarity on these matters.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">2. Free Communism</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The plea for clarity appears very strongly in Müller-Lehning's 
pamphlet, <i>Anarcho-syndicalism</i>. He opposes the view that the immediate 
task is to wreak universal destruction whilst at the same time the task of 
discovering how society may once again be organised can be left safely to the 
indefinite future (ibid.; p. 4). A programme is necessary to determine "how 
anarcho-syndicalism may be realised after the revolution has taken place" 
(ibid.; p. 5). It is not enough merely to propagate the economic revolution, 
"but one must also subject to examination how it is to be carried through" 
(ibid.; p. 6). The Russian anarchists placed the self-initiative of the masses 
in the foreground, "but the question as to how this initiative was actually to 
express itself, what the masses were actually to undertake, today and tomorrow - 
all that remained vague and only slightly positive" (ibid.; p. 7). "Many 
manifestos made their appearance, but to the question of daily practice it was 
only very few which could give a clear and simple answer" (ibid.; p. 8). The 
following is a quotation from Müller-Lehning's pamphlet:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"It is necessary to say the Russian Revolution has posed the 
question once and for all time: <i>what are the practical and economic 
foundations of a society without a wages system?</i> What is to be done on the 
day after the revolution? Anarchism will have to answer this question, it will 
have to take the lesson of the last few years to heart, if total failure is not 
to find its conclusion in irredeemable bankruptcy. The old anarchist solutions, 
however much truth they may have contained and however much they may have been 
chanted in repetition, have solved not a single problem posed by real life. In 
particular, they do not solve a single one of the problems which the social 
revolution has placed before the working class." (Müller-Lehning: <i>
Anarcho-Syndicalism</i>, p. 10).</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Without these practical realities all propaganda remains 
negative and all ideals remain utopia. This is the lesson which anarchism has to 
learn from history, and which - and this cannot be repeated too often - has been 
proved ever and again through the tragic experience of the Russian Revolution." 
(p. 11).</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The economic organisations have as their aim the 
disappropriation of capital and the disarming of the state. It is the productive 
associations of the workers which must take the place of the organs of 
capitalism and the state, which must function as the pillars supporting the 
whole of economic life. <i>The foundation must be the factory</i>, <i>the 
factory organisations must form the germinal cells for the new economy and 
social organisation</i>. The entire system of production must be constructed on 
the basis of the federal organisation of industry and agriculture." 
(Müller-Lehning: ibid.; p. 18).</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Whoever wishes to see an end to capitalism and state capitalism 
must replace these realities of social life with other realities and other 
economic organisations. That can be done only by the producers themselves. And 
they can do this only collectively, in and through their own organisations. 
Collectively in the factory, collectively in industry, etc. They must organise 
themselves in order to administer the means of production through their 
federalised industrial organisations, and so organise the whole of economic life 
on an industrial and federal basis." (Müller-Lehning: ibid.; p. 19).</p>

<p class="fst">This pamphlet, published in 1927, makes a fundamental advance 
compared with all others which up till now have appeared as attempting to make a 
contribution to the clarification of this question. It is not so much that it 
makes its point in compelling conceptual flourishes, but its great virtue is the 
fact that it does make the attempt to absorb certain experiences of the Russian 
revolution and to transform them into weapons for the future class struggle. The 
vision of a federal structure for economic life has been derived from the first 
period of the Russian revolution. However, the author demonstrates <i>ad nauseam</i> 
that this in reality only represented a first attempt to pose a problem, and not 
a single one of them can he offer a solution.</p>

<p class="fst">A French anarchist, Sebastian Faure, attempted to find a 
solution. His book <i>Universal Happiness</i>, published in 1921, depicts his 
conception of free communism. The importance of this book lies in the fact that 
it shows that anarchist conceptions of communist society do not necessarily 
exclude a system of centralised disposal and control over social production. For 
a close examination of the Faurian system of 'free communism' shows that it is 
in reality nothing other than vulgar state-communism. Indeed, the book does not 
bear the character of a scientific examination, but is couched more in the form 
of a utopian novel in which a "free communist society" is made to grow out of 
pure fantasy. Nevertheless, the fact that, in opposition to such phrases as 
"equality for all", "freely concluded agreements" and "the elevating spiritual 
principle of opposition to the state and state power", a system of production is 
depicted in which the right of control over production does not lie with the 
producers themselves clearly demonstrates that, in this particular camp at 
least, there is absolutely no fear of this particular author giving any evidence 
whatever of any understanding of the laws of motion applicable to a communist 
system!</p>

<p class="fst">Faure is opposed to power as a "thing in itself", and for that 
reason he speaks of the hundreds and thousands of threads and links which 
forcibly bind together against their will all who cooperate in the modern 
productive apparatus. He writes: "This whole organisation (i.e. his system - 
Ed.) is founded on the inspiring spiritual principle of free cooperation" (p. 
213). We however are of the opinion that this cannot be the foundation of any 
system of production and reproduction. Should the producers wish to make their 
rights secure, whether with or without the aid of an "inspiring spiritual 
principle", then the whole organisation must be founded to a far greater degree 
upon a firm, material basis. The producers must themselves determine in their 
workplaces the relationship of the producer to the social product. They must 
calculate how much labour-time is absorbed in each product, for their 
labour-time is the measure of their share in the social product. Only then can 
the entire organisation depend, not on some "spiritual" ideal wafting upon the 
breeze of some abstract principle, but be founded in economic reality.</p>

<p class="fst">In the case of the mutual relationship to be established between 
the producers themselves, we find once again the same vague, vacillating basis 
expressed through the concept of "free agreements". Here also there is no clear 
foundation, no system of time-based regulation and accounting control over the 
stream of products from factory to factory. But without this material foundation 
these "free agreements" also remain nothing but empty phrases. "One tries out 
this, tests the other, combines them and tests the results of the various 
methods. The resultant unanimity takes form, makes its appeal and pushes through 
on the strength of its results, and finally triumphs" (p. 334). For Faure, this 
foundation, grounded in freedom for each and achieved through the unanimity of 
all, is no more than natural. "Is it not so in nature also? The example of 
nature is there, clear and distinct. Everything there is joined through free and 
spontaneous mutual accommodations... The myriad tiny elements, like grains of 
dust, seek each other out, attract one another, gather together and form an 
atom" (p. 334).</p>

<p class="fst">We would point out in this connection that analogies drawn from 
nature are always extremely dangerous, and particularly in this special case the 
Faurian method reveals "clearly and understandably" how wholly inadequate it is. 
In Faure's world everything is joined through "free and spontaneous mutual 
accommodations". However, what is in fact so wonderful is the way in which, 
without further thought, the human concept of freedom is transferred to the 
field of nature. In the realm of "pure metaphor", of course one can escape from 
any responsibility. In this case Faure overlooks completely the decisive moment 
at which these "free and spontaneous mutual accommodations" actually arise in 
nature; that moment is, of course, determined by the mutual relations of forces 
between the participating members. If the sun and earth conclude a "free and 
spontaneous agreement" with one another that the earth should revolve around the 
sun in 365 days, <i>this is amongst other things determined by the mass of the 
sun and the earth respectively in relation to one another</i>. This is the real 
material foundation on which their "free mutual accommodation" is concluded.</p>

<p class="fst">It is always thus that matters are ordered in nature. Its atoms, 
or any other form of matter in motion, enter into relations based upon a balance 
of opposed forces. The exact form of this relationship is determined by the 
specific nature of the forces at work between the two opposed yet united 
partners. It is for this reason that we also are pleased to adopt this example 
from nature, but we do so only in order to demonstrate by these means how an 
exact relationship of the producer to the product must be present if such a 
"free and spontaneous mutual accommodation" is to be concluded successfully in 
the conditions of human society. It is by these means that this agreement is 
transformed from a mere phrase into reality. Although it is obvious that Faure 
has never actually concerned himself with economic problems, it soon becomes 
apparent that he is a representative of the Neurath school, that is to say, a 
"natural" economist.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> As we have already seen, this school considers a unit of 
regulation and accounting control to be absolutely superfluous, and proposes to 
achieve the same result by means of a production plan drawn up with the help of 
statistics:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"It is also necessary above all to determine the total demand 
for, and the quantity of, each separate need. ... The communes should then make 
these needs known to the Central Administration Office responsible for the whole 
national economy, according to the number of inhabitants, whereby the officials 
there obtain a survey of the total needs of the 'nation'. Each commune then 
produces a second list indicating how much they are able to produce, from which 
the 'central administration' is now able to assess the productive forces of the 
'nation'. The outcome of the process is very clear. The higher officials should 
now determine which proportion of production is to be allotted to each commune 
and which proportion of production they may retain for themselves". (S. Faure: <i>
Universal Happiness</i>, pp. 215-6)</p>

<p class="fst">This procedure is exactly the same as that conceived by the state 
communists: down below - the masses; above - the officials, who retain the 
management and administration of production and distribution in their hands. 
With such a system, society is not founded on economic reality but is dependent 
upon the good or bad will of individuals, or upon their administrative ability - 
something that Faure readily admits. In order that there should be no doubt 
concerning the need for a central right of control, he adds: "The central 
administration knows the extent of total production and total demand and must 
therefore inform each local committee as to how much product it has at its 
disposal and how much means of production it must produce" (p. 218). In order to 
be quite clear that all this has nothing to do with any specific kind of <i>free 
communism</i>, we will compare it with the <i>social-democratic communism</i><a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a> 
described by Hilferding . We will see that the two agree with one another almost 
word for word:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Exactly how, where, in what quantity and by what means new 
products will be produced out of the existing natural and man-made means of 
production ... is decided by the commissariats of the socialist society at 
national or local level. <i>It is they who mould with conscious intent the whole 
of economic life</i>, <i>utilising for this purpose all the instruments at the 
disposal of organised production and consumption statistics</i>, in accordance 
with the needs of the communities as they, the social commissariats, have 
consciously represented and formulated them."<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> (Authors' emphases - Ed.)</p>

<p class="fst">From this it is quite clear that in this form of 'free communism' 
the right of disposal over the productive apparatus is given to those who are 
well acquainted with the tricks of the statistical art. One would have thought 
that the anarchists would have learned enough about political economy to have 
known that whoever holds control over the productive apparatus also disposes 
over the power in society. The "central administration" described above is 
compelled to provide for itself the means for making its will effective, that is 
to say, it must set itself up as a state. This indeed is one of the laws of 
motion of the Faurian system, whether this is Faure's intention or not; it is 
also quite immaterial whether the dish is served up with a sauce composed of 
"free agreements", or with the gravy of a "spiritual principle. Such condiments 
disguising the true flavour of the dish would not disturb the actual political 
and economic realities in the slightest!</p>

<p class="fst">The substance of the matter is not that one would hold it against 
the Faurian system that it seeks to forge the entire economy into one single 
unit; such an act of combination is indeed the end purpose of the process of 
development which is brought to fruition by the combined producers and 
consumers. Having done this, however, the basis must then be provided <i>to 
ensure that they themselves - the producers and consumers - keep control of it</i>. 
To achieve they must keep an exact account of the labour-hours used up, in every 
form of economic activity, in order that they may know exactly how much 
labour-time is embodied in each product. Then it is quite unnecessary for the 
right of decision as to how the social product is to be distributed to be handed 
over to any "central administration"; on the contrary, the producers themselves 
in each factory or other establishment can then determine this through their 
computation of labour-time expended.</p>

<p class="fst">Faure's <i>Universal Happiness</i> makes not the slightest 
contribution to our knowledge of communist production and distribution. If we 
have looked into this work a little more closely, it has been solely for the 
reason that, through making a sharp criticism of such fantasies concerning the 
"free communist society" it is possible to demonstrate clearly just how much 
progress in this sphere has been achieved over the last decade. Before 1917 it 
was impossible to uncover the state-communist kernel lying concealed within this 
mountain of misleading phraseology. Above all else it has been the school of 
practice embodied in the Russian revolution which we must thank for this 
knowledge, because it is this which has shown us in unmistakable terms exactly 
what the consequences are of permitting a central authority to establish itself 
as a social power which then proceeds to concentrate in its exclusive hands all 
power over the productive apparatus.</p>
