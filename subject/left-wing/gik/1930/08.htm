<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h1">1. Accumulation as a Social Function</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Up to this point we have considered social production only as 
simple reproduction. Distribution of the total social product takes place in 
such a way that all the means of production and raw materials used up are again 
replaced, whilst individual consumption accounts for the remainder. In this form 
of distribution, the total of social production remains the same, the same net 
quantity of goods are produced; that is to say, society does not become any 
wealthier. The intrinsic end-purpose towards which the principle of "consumption 
according to need" tends to gravitate, and which is also motivated through the 
spontaneous increase in the population, is however that which demands that that 
necessary degree of enlargement of the productive apparatus is aimed for which 
will be sufficient to achieve both these aims. This then has as its necessary 
outcome a reduction in the quantity of product hitherto assumed to have been 
assigned for individual consumption; a part of this must now be invested in the 
task of enlarging the productive apparatus. This inevitably means that <i>the 
individual producer can no longer receive back from society the full yield of 
that individual's labour</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Under capitalism the extension of the productive apparatus, or 
accumulation, is a motive and responsibility of the individual capitalist group. 
Whether or not and to what degree the productive apparatus is to be renewed is 
decided by it alone. With the elimination of private property in means of 
production, however, accumulation assumes a social character. Society itself 
then decides how much product or how many labour-hours are to be deducted during 
the coming production period from the total labour yield and invested in the 
further extension of the productive apparatus. Thus the problem confronts us as 
to how this deduction is to be carried out. The solution generally adopted, such 
as has been applied in practice in the two examples of Soviet Russia and Soviet 
Hungary and such as has been afforded definite status in the theoretical 
literature, is implemented by means of an increment added to the prices of 
products to take account of the needs of accumulation. If we have already been 
at pains to demonstrate that a price policy infringes the principle of a direct 
relationship of the producer to the product of the producer's labour,<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> in just 
the same way as this occurs under capitalism; and if this can then serve as a 
means for concealing the true state of affairs of economic life, in an exactly 
analogous way can it now be demonstrated that by this means both the production 
budget and the indices controlling accumulation come to be veiled in mystery. If 
it is necessary to determine how much labour, over and above the needs of simple 
reproduction, society needs to deploy for the purposes of investment in the 
extension of the productive apparatus, then it is necessary to know as a first 
requirement how much labour has been absorbed in simple reproduction.</p>

<p class="fst">Leichter has made an approach towards a solution of the problem, 
in that he places production on the basis of labour-time computation and 
advocates that the production time for each partial process should be exactly 
calculated. He has, however, spoiled his own broth, in that he prejudices the 
viability of the whole system of labour-hour computation through his advocacy of 
a price policy. The productive establishments may pursue the most exact system 
of book-keeping for all partial processes and have brought all factors such as 
depreciation, raw materials, etc., within the purview of their system of 
accounting - nevertheless the "science of prices" practiced by the supreme 
management must celebrate its orgies and so render all this necessary 
book-keeping useless, so that society has once again no way of knowing how many 
labour-hours are actually consumed in each partial process. In other words, it 
becomes impossible to ascertain how many labour-hours have been consumed in 
total reproduction. It thus of necessity also becomes impossible to determine 
how many labour-hours must be laid aside for investment in the extension of the 
productive apparatus. If the aim is to elevate the accumulation process to the 
level of a consciously implemented procedure, then it is above all necessary 
that the time required for simple reproduction be a known quantity, and the 
observations we have made on this matter show that this can be exactly revealed 
and made known only through the generally applicable formula (p + c) + L. In the 
case of the total production process, this becomes</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">(Pt + Ct) = Lt (Index t = total)</p>

<p class="fst">The question of the expansion of the productive apparatus will in 
the communist future become one of the most important in society, because it is 
a factor contributing to the determination of the length of the working day. 
Were, for instance, the Economic Congress of the Workers' Councils to reach a 
decision that the productive apparatus should be expanded by 10%, this would 
then require that a mass of products amounting to 0.1(Pt + Ct) should be 
withdrawn from the sphere of individual consumption. Once the construction tasks 
associated with these particular accumulation measures had been completed, 
production would then continue according to the formula 1.1(Pt + Ct) + Lt.</p>

<p class="fst">The next question to be asked is: how is the general decision to 
implement a rate of accumulation amounting to 10% to be reached in practice? In 
other words, how is the deduction from the sphere of individual consumption to 
take place? It will be recalled that, during our examination of the process of 
simple reproduction, it was demonstrated that the entire social product would be 
consumed by society if individual consumption was to take place according to the 
formula:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">FIC = <u>L - (Pu + Cu)</u></p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">L + Lu</p>

<p class="fst">(To achieve a simplified representation, we have not included the 
mixed establishments in the formula; in principle this makes no difference).</p>

<p class="fst">Now however, in the new situation, individual consumption must be 
reduced by a factor of 0.1(Pt + Ct), whereby a mass of products equivalent to L- 
0.1(Pt + Ct) - (Pu + Cu) would remain available for consumption. With a 10% 
expansion of the productive system, the Factor of Individual Consumption (FIC) 
would be modified as follows:</p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">FIC = <u>L- 0.1(Pt + Ct) - (Pu + Cu)</u></p>

<p class="fst" style="text-align: center">L + Lu</p>

<p class="fst">By this means, the process of accumulation is integrated into the 
Factor of Individual Consumption, and there thus comes into being a general 
social fund amounting to exactly 0.1(Pt + Ct) labour-hours, with the completion 
of which the general decision originally adopted by the Economic Congress of the 
Workers' Councils has been fully implemented.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">2. The Application of the Accumulation Fund</a></h3>

<p class="fst">The foregoing observations lay claim to possessing no more 
significance than that of theoretical generalisations, in the sense that they 
show how accumulation can and must be fully and consciously regulated and 
integrated with the Factor of Individual Consumption. Should it not be so 
integrated, the addition of a price increment becomes unavoidable - in other 
words, the actual production times will become concealed. Furthermore, in a year 
in which a higher rate of accumulation has been achieved, say 10%, a 
correspondingly longer production time will be required than in a following year 
in which, for instance, only 5% accumulation is attained, the general conditions 
of production remaining the same. Thus, in such a case, we have fluctuating 
production times, causing unforeseeable complications in the production budget 
and in the distribution of the product. The means and methods according to which 
the deduction on account of accumulation is to be implemented are thus decided 
and resolved within the economic process itself; they are prescribed by the very 
laws of motion which underlie the production of the product stream itself. For 
that reason their movements are circumscribed within firmly defined limits.</p>

<p class="fst">The determination of the <i>rate</i> of accumulation, on the 
other hand, is not implemented through the material process of production as 
such, but can be determined in a variety of ways. In our above example we have 
assumed a general expansion of the productive apparatus by 10%. There is thus 
made available out of the general accumulation fund a factor of 0.1(P + C) for 
the extension of means of production in each productive establishment. A special 
instruction from some authority or other is not required. The objective course 
of production itself reveals quite clearly the amount for any claim of a 
withdrawal from the accumulation fund put forward by any one productive 
establishment.</p>

<p class="fst">To conceive of an expansion of the productive apparatus at a 
unified rate amounts, however, to an unreal assumption. In reality there will be 
branches of production which require no extension whatever, others for which a 
rate of accumulation above the average rate per cent is necessary. For this 
reason it will be seen to be a useful principle that only those productive 
establishments which require expansion should be allocated an accumulation fund 
as a part of the general GSU budget.</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, the political and economic conditions prevalent 
during the early inceptive period of communism will make it imperative that the 
proletariat keep tight hold of its right even to an irrational mode of 
determining and allocating accumulation, if in its immaturity it occasionally so 
decides. The decisive factor is that, in the absence of a central authority 
exercising the right of control over <i>production</i>, there can also be no 
central authority exercising control over <i>accumulation</i> - in this sphere 
also the right of control must lie in the hands of the producers themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">An example of an irrational mode of allocating accumulation would 
be, for instance, if each productive establishment were to receive an increase 
of 10% in (P + C) without any account being taken as to how much of this 
expansion was really necessary at any given stage of economic development. 
Should such an industrial establishment form part of a production group or 
"guild", the practical outcome of the application of such a measure would be 
that the associated industrial establishments would together take steps to form 
an accumulation fund for the entire guild. The relevant industrial organisations 
would then decide according to what method and to which industrial 
establishments that fund would be applied. In one case they could decide that 
underproductive establishments should be better equipped in order to enable them 
to reach the average level of productivity, whilst in another case a more 
rational decision might be to not add any new material resources whatever, and 
instead to take measures to eliminate the relevant establishments altogether. 
The power to enact these decisions must, however, lie in the hands of the 
producers themselves if a situation is to be avoided in which a screwing up of 
productivity is directed against their interests, as occurred in Hungary. In 
each and every such case an extension of production or any increase in 
productivity - factors which stand in organic association with a quantitative 
extension of the productive apparatus or a qualitative improvement in its 
technological level - must be the result of consciously determined measures 
taken by the producers themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">Furthermore, it is also possible that an entire production group 
requires no extension whatever of its productive plant and equipment, because it 
is already fully capable of satisfying all demands likely to be placed upon it 
by society. In such a case in would be possible for the relevant industrial 
organisations to adopt a decision to place their entire accumulation fund at the 
disposal of those industrial establishments which stand in need of an 
exceptionally large degree of expansion.</p> 

<p class="fst">In the early inceptive period of a communist economy, it is 
likely that decisions not to engage in accumulation would occur quite 
frequently. For communism will require a different disposal of industrial 
resources to those which we know today. Many types of factories will become 
superfluous, whilst in the case of others there will be too few. With the 
establishment of a communist economy, the subordination of production to real 
needs is brought to the forefront of attention; a colossal organisational and 
technical labour is then commenced upon, which almost certainly will not proceed 
without its disagreements and frictions. Thanks to the twice and thrice-blessed 
"market mechanism" so beloved of capitalism, which allegedly has matched 
production to needs for centuries, the proletariat is, at the very moment of its 
assumption of social power, burdened with a productive apparatus in which at 
least half of all labour-power required to be expended in its operation is 
wastefully and unproductively applied, and which is matched not to the real 
needs of millions of workers, but only to their intrinsically limited purchasing 
power:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"A larger part of the workers employed in the production of 
articles of consumption which enter into revenue in general, will produce 
articles of consumption that are consumed by - are exchanged against the revenue 
of - capitalists, landlords and their retainers; state, church, etc.) and a 
smaller section will produce articles destined for the revenue of the workers. 
... The workmen, if they were dominant, if they were allowed to produce for 
themselves, would very soon, and without great exertion, bring the capital (to 
use a phrase of the vulgar economists) up to the standard of their needs." (K. 
Marx: <i>Theories of Surplus Value</i>, Part 2, Chap. 18; trans. by R. Simpson; 
Lawrence &amp; Wishart, London, 1969; p. 580)</p>

<p class="fst">The conversion of production to the satisfaction of needs thus 
brings with it as its necessary consequence the transformation of the entire 
productive apparatus. Those industrial establishments working solely for the 
satisfaction of the ephemeral luxury requirements of the bourgeoisie are closed 
down, or are reorganised as quickly as possible, so as to enable them to satisfy 
the needs of the workers. Just how rapidly such a re-organisation can be carried 
out we have been given an opportunity to observe during the War and in the years 
immediately following it. In the first case the greater part of the productive 
apparatus was converted to the production of war material, only to undergo 
reorganisation once again after 1918 for the purposes of "production for peace". 
Further, let it be noted in passing that capitalism itself in not above 
switching off its famous market mechanism whenever the task becomes that of 
organising production for the satisfaction of its "special needs" - particularly 
those of war!</p>

<p class="fst">The organisational transformation to a communist economy can, in 
spite of the colossal attendant difficulties, be carried through relatively 
rapidly, whereupon the satisfaction of such staple needs as clothing, food and 
housing become the decisive factors. For one thing, it is likely, particularly 
in the early stages of a communist society, that an appreciable portion of total 
productive resources will be applied directly to the production of those 
materials which find application in the construction of housing and living 
accommodation - a perennially scarce resource in proletarian life under 
capitalism, and which, under communism, would need to be expanded as rapidly as 
possible. Expressed in brief: the entire productive apparatus undergoes a 
fundamental transformation according to need, as this is expressed through the 
instrumentality of the consumer cooperatives.</p>

<p class="fst">The first and inceptive stage of communist production will thus 
be characterised by the pronounced growth of certain branches of the economy and 
an equally pronounced shrinking of others. Under these circumstances, there will 
be no question of a homogenous and uniform rate of accumulation for all sectors 
of the young communist economy. Nevertheless, irrespective of any muddle which 
might quite likely attend the feverishly rapid conversion of the economic base, 
the proletariat should not allow itself to be seduced into renouncing its 
foremost birthright: its right of disposal over the productive apparatus and the 
accumulation fund. Even a possible uneconomic or irrational mode of allocating 
the latter would be justified if it was found to be an unavoidable outcome of 
serving and applying that higher principle.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">3. Special Forms of Accumulation</a></h3>

<p class="fst">Apart from the standard forms of expansion of the productive 
apparatus, which are implemented through claims placed by the industrial 
organisations upon the accumulation fund, there are other special industrial 
tasks, such as the construction of bridges and railways, enlargement of major 
road arteries, the construction of major defence barriers against the sea, etc. 
These tasks generally require several years for their completion. During this 
time the most varied products, materials and means of consumption are supplied 
by society to satisfy the needs of the workers engaged therein, whilst in the 
meantime no product is produced which might compensate society for the resources 
it has supplied. This particular form of the extension of the productive 
apparatus consumes not a small part of the total social product. As a 
consequence, a significant number of debates at economic congresses will of 
necessity need to concern themselves with reaching decisions as to the scale 
upon which these construction tasks are to be undertaken. In this way society as 
a whole makes giant strides along the path towards its higher development, since 
the more the productivity of the apparatus of production can be raised and the 
more readily social needs are fulfilled, the more does the capacity of society 
to carry through the most complex and developed functions increase:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"On the basis of social production, it would be necessary to 
determine to what extent it was possible to pursue those operations, which 
withdraw labour-power and means of production for a relatively long period 
without any useful product or useful effect during this time, without damaging 
those branches of production that not only withdraw labour-power and means of 
production continuously or several times in a course of a year, but also supply 
means of subsistence and means of production. With social production just as 
with capitalist production, workers in branches of industry with short working 
periods will withdraw products only for a short time without giving other 
products back in return, while branches of industry with long working periods 
will continue to withdraw products for a long time before they give anything 
back. This circumstance arises from the material conditions of the 
labour-process in question, and not from its social form." (K. Marx: <i>Capital</i>, 
Vol 2, Pt. 3, Chap. 18; Penguin Books; p. 434).</p>

<p class="quoteb">"If we were to consider a communist society in place of a 
capitalist one, then money-capital would be immediately done away with, and so 
too the disguises that transactions acquire through it. The matter would be 
simply reduced to the fact that society must reckon in advance how much labour, 
means of production and means of subsistence it can spend, without dislocation, 
on branches of industry which, like the building of railways, for instance, 
supply neither means of production nor means of subsistence, nor any kind of 
useful effect, for a long period, a year or more, though they certainly do 
withdraw labour, means of production and means of subsistence from the total 
annual product. In capitalist society, on the other hand, where any kind of 
social rationality asserts itself only <i>post festum</i>, major disturbances 
can and must occur constantly"(K. Marx: <i>Capital</i>, Vol 2, Pt. 2, Chap. 16; 
Penguin Books; p. 390).</p>

<p class="fst">In the above paragraphs the problem is set forth with the 
greatest clarity and the solution in general terms is simultaneously given. 
Nevertheless, it is no more than a loose and generalised solution, which still 
requires to be given more concrete form. And here once again there is a parting 
of the ways between the contending views. On the one side we have the Social 
Democratic and Bolshevik defenders of nationalisation or central economic 
administration, and on the other side the representatives of the Association of 
Free and Equal producers. In just the same way as contemporary vulgar "marxism" 
considers a central economic administration to be an essential instrument in 
making provision for the necessary social costs, so also does it consider this 
to be necessary for the solution of the problem posed above.</p>

<p class="fst">According to the Social Democratic or Bolshevik view, the obvious 
solution is that the central administration of the entire economy determines 
quite arbitrarily the course to be taken by the whole system of production and 
distribution, and so also takes into account those special cases mentioned 
above. Indeed, this question forms one of the main arguments through which the 
advocates of pragmatic social-democratic perspectives believe that the necessity 
for the administration of the entire economy through a centralised control 
authority i.e., through the State, is proved. They make the point that crises 
and other social disturbances such as occur under capitalism as a result of 
carrying out such tasks can only be avoided when the entire system of production 
is supervised and controlled from above by an arbitrary subjective authority. 
Furthermore, this is indisputably the case - under both capitalism and State 
socialism! For "marxists" of this calibre proof is thereby given that the State 
must of necessity manage and administer the entire economy in all technical, 
organisational and economic respects. The methods which the State then applies 
in order to control production and distribution, in order subsequently to solve 
the aforementioned problem confronting it by the device of substituting for it 
purely technical-organisational, i.e., subsidiary ones - these methods we are 
able to find in the oft-quoted Hilferdingian recipe:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Exactly how, where, in what quantity and by what means new 
products will be produced out of the existing and man-made means of production 
... is decided by the social commissariats of the socialist society at national 
or local level. It is they who mould with conscious intent the whole of economic 
life, utilising for this purpose all the instruments at the disposal of 
organised production and consumption statistics, in accordance with the needs of 
the communities as they, the social commissariats, have consciously represented 
and formulated them." (R. Hilferding: <i>Finance Capital</i>, trans. T. 
Bottomore, p. 28.)</p>

<p class="fst">We have already indicated above as to what extent and to what 
purpose such statistics suffice, how in the realm of theory they amount to no 
more than a blueprint for a communism of a prison-camp, and how in the realm of 
practice they must for that reason inevitably collapse. Over and above this, 
however, it is clear that such statistics only serve any purpose when they are 
based upon a system of economic regulation and control through social 
book-keeping. A system of statistics which indicate how many tonnes of coal, 
grain, iron, etc., have been consumed, whether measured in quantity, by weight 
or by whatever other unit of measures and in respect of whatever goods, is for 
the purposes of social regulation of production and distribution <i>completely 
valueless</i> One may conjure up as many sophisticated indices and formulae as 
one wishes, if the fundamental unit of measurement is not one based upon social 
relations, is not one which expresses the <i>relationship of the producer to the 
product</i>, then each and every method of statistics dreamed up for the purpose 
of regulating social production and reproduction can only be quite worthless. 
The whole meaning and purpose of the social revolution is precisely that it is 
concerned with transforming, indeed <i>turning upside down and placing upon its 
feet</i>, the existing capitalist relation of the producer to the product. It 
was the great achievement of Karl Marx that he perceived this relationship in 
all its historical significance, and proceeded to develop it into an exact 
science in application to the capitalist mode of production. With the 
transformation of the social order the relationship of producer to the product 
is also transformed, and the new mode of production requires precisely that a 
new definition of this social relationship be elaborated.</p>

<p class="fst">The social revolution secures this new relationship and places it 
on a firm foundation, by offering to each worker a claim to just so much social 
product as corresponds with the labour-time that worker has placed at society's 
disposal. The revolution establishes the system of labour-time computation and 
accounting throughout society as the instrument for achieving that new 
relationship.</p>

<p class="fst">The lords of statistical apparatus do not consider even for a 
moment the possibility of establishing the new relationship, and for that reason 
it does not even occur to them to introduce the system of labour-time 
computation. Instead, they make use of the old established categories and 
methods of the capitalist society, such as the market, prices, commodities, 
money - tools with which it is impossible to ensure control even over simple 
reproduction. The State-capitalist system has not the faintest conception of 
just how much labour-time has been consumed in a particular sector of 
production, and even less idea how much labour-time has been consumed in order 
to achieve simple reproduction!</p>

<p class="fst">That a State-communist - or, even more to the point, a 
State-capitalist - social system might find the means to compute in advance 
"just how much labour, means of production and means of consumption it can 
employ without causing any disruption to any other branch of the economy - such 
as would occur, for instance, with the construction of railways over a longer 
period of time without any compensating supply of means of production or 
consumption or any other useful social service being rendered" - this, of 
course, would be for such a social system completely out of the question! These 
problems it must and would solve in the same manner as that by means of which 
they are solved under capitalism - by chaotic and arbitrary rule of thumb. The 
damage thereby inflicted in other branches of production would then have to be 
made good by whatever means lie to hand; clearly this offers no solution to the 
problem; in fact, it amounts to leaving affairs as they were under the old 
system.</p>

<p class="fst">Communism cannot employ such a method, and furthermore it has no 
need to. By means of exact methods of computation it is possible to calculate 
the exact time required for the reproduction of each and every commodity or 
service, be it a kilogram of sugar or a theatre performance, an entire branch of 
production or the whole of economic life itself; whilst simultaneously a 
publicly declared rate of accumulation proceeds along firm and clearly defined 
lines. By the same means it then becomes possible for society to determine 
accurately how much labour-time it is able to invest in large-scale projects, 
the influence of any subjective element being simultaneously excluded from any 
access to social control. And so it happens that this problem also finds its 
concrete solution in a system based upon the exact definition of the 
relationship of the producer to the product, achieved by a system of labour-time 
computation and implemented through the agency of the factory and other 
industrial organisations, the Workers' Councils.</p>

<p class="fst">Should, for instance, the construction of a new railway prove to 
be necessary, the first step would be the drawing up of a budget in which is 
indicated how many labour-hours this operation would consume and the number of 
years over which it would spread. Should the decision be taken by the Economic 
Congress of Workers' Councils to set this operation into motion, society would 
then have the responsibility for making the necessary resources available. The 
operation would, of course, be classified under the category GSU, it would 
require, say, from 3-4 years for its completion and thus, during this period, 
would require to consume a variety of products without any compensating ability 
to supply any service in return. As soon as, however, the quantity of 
labour-hours to be expended each year becomes known, this can be deducted from 
the Factor of Individual Consumption (FIC) in the GSU account, and therewith 
society has made available out of general production the total product 
equivalent of labour-hours required for pre-producing this special unit of 
accumulation. All possible causes of disruption or disturbance to other spheres 
of production are thereby avoided, whilst simultaneously the principle of an 
exact relationship of the producer to the product is not infringed.</p>

<p class="fst">Seen solely from the aspect of the economic factors involved, the 
problem has therewith found its solution. There remains to be solved only the 
organisational and technical problems and the appropriate distribution of the 
human resources. Here, it is possible to make only the most general 
observations, for the simple reason that, in this case, the solution no longer 
belongs in the sphere of the theory of communist economy, but is one of human 
social practice in its myriad forms and with its continually changing 
relationships. Thus it is not possible to determine in advance precisely what 
shape the special will take within the bosom of the general.</p>

<p class="fst">For this reason we content ourselves only with the general 
observation that, so soon as society has taken a decision to embark upon 
construction works of an extraordinary kind, such as the construction of 
railways, etc., and has made available the necessary labour-hours of social 
product through adoption into the GSU account, it has thereby simultaneously 
decided upon a corresponding regrouping of the necessary resources in human 
labour.</p>

<p class="fst">In order to render this category in comprehensible form, we must 
first of all conceive in our minds the simplified model of a communist economy 
developing on the basis of simple reproduction. From out of the regularly 
occurring demands submitted by the distribution organisation, which of course 
exercises the responsibility for combining the myriad individual needs reaching 
it from the economy at large into a single combined total, there arises over a 
period of time a productive apparatus adapted to the satisfaction of those 
needs. If it is likewise assumed in our simplified model that variations in the 
productive apparatus arising out of changes in the objective conditions of 
production do not occur, such a mutual integration and adjustment to each others 
needs on the part of the many industrial establishments concerned would make it 
possible to conceive of such a productive apparatus as being in a condition of <i>
virtual immobility</i>. In such a case, the distribution of labour resources 
would also be stationary, whereby, as a natural course, changes by individuals 
from one workplace to another would appear to be quite possible and routine.</p>

<p class="fst">That such a situation should arise in a system of social 
production is of course purely imaginary; the reality would mean that it would 
move continually further away from such a condition. This, of course, is what 
occurs in the case of standard accumulation, which we generally assume to take 
place at a regular and even rate. It is inevitable that changes in the 
productive apparatus will occur and make necessary corresponding changes in the 
distribution of the labour resources. In the case of irregular and uneven 
accumulation, these changes will assume a fluctuating character; nevertheless it 
is hardly likely that social difficulties will arise in the distribution of 
labour resources. That which capitalism acquires out of conditions of coercion 
from out of the reservoir of the industrial reserve army, communism will obtain 
by means of the natural urge for activity and the creative initiative exercised 
by the free producers.</p>

<p class="fst">It is also this which justifies the assumption that extraordinary 
construction operations such as those described above will not cause 
difficulties for a communist society on anything like the scale that they entail 
for capitalism. This is related, of course, to the willingness of the producers 
to carry out such exceptional works. After all, it is they themselves who will 
adopt the necessary decisions through their relevant organisations.</p>

<p class="fst">A further question to be considered is whether, expressed in 
capitalist terms, sufficient labour resources would be available for the 
carrying through of such special construction operations. We emphasise on 
purpose the words "expressed in capitalist terms", because a capitalist economy 
is able to make use of the reservoir of surplus labour which is always available 
to it through the industrial reserve army, whilst such a thing would be a 
monstrosity under communism. Thus, whenever communism seeks to organise such 
special construction operations, it must also encourage the redeployment of 
labour resources from one or another sphere of employment to that of the new 
one; in other words a regrouping of labour resources must occur.</p>

<p class="fst">The extent of this regrouping and the spheres of production from 
which such labour resources are released are, however, aspects of the matter 
which would already be indicated within and through the relevant decision of the 
Economic Congress of Workers' Councils that the construction works in question 
should be put in hand and the corresponding reduction in the Factor of 
Individual Consumption (FIC) effected. As a consequence, the sphere of 
individual consumption reduces its demand upon production by the total of 
labour-hours which have been computed as necessary annually for the 
pre-production of the particular extraordinary construction operations in hand. 
It will therefore be from the spheres thus affected that the labour resources 
can be made available which are required for the intended railway construction 
works, etc.</p>

<p class="fst">In conclusion, we would observe additionally that, as far as such 
extraordinary construction works are concerned, the scope and size of the 
industrial resources required by them and the production spheres under which 
these would fall would in the longer term become subject to standardised 
economic procedures. As long as such a situation might arise, there would no 
linger occur any appreciable displacement in the disposition of productive 
resources, whereby the labour resources required for such extraordinary 
construction works would become more or less permanently available.</p>
