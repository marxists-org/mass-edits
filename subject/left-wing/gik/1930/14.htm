<h3><a name="h1">1. Development Towards Commodity Production</a></h3>

<p class="fst">It is a well-known principle that every new society is born 
within the womb of the old. In the course of its tempestuous development, the 
capitalist system has brought into being an ever more powerful and concentrated 
productive apparatus, in the course of which on the one hand the numbers of 
bourgeois proprietors of industry, in whose hands control over that apparatus is 
concentrated, becomes ever more restricted; whilst, on the other hand, the army 
of the proletarians grows continually to an unheard of degree. This development 
simultaneously creates the conditions which ultimately lead to the fall of 
capitalism. The necessary precondition for this unrelenting growth in the 
numerical size of the proletariat is an ever more intensive concomitant rate of 
exploitation, whilst at the same time the general insecurity of material 
existence keeps equal pace with this. (See K. Marx: <i>Wage Labour &amp; Capital</i>). 
Under these conditions there remains for the proletariat to an ever increasing 
degree only one solution: communism.</p>

<p class="fst">However, if we observe along side this development in industry 
that simultaneously taking place in agriculture, then we perceive a completely 
different picture. In spite of all the prophesies that the same degree of 
concentration would also become a feature of the agricultural economy, and that 
the small and middle peasants would to an increasing degree be ruined and 
destroyed by large agrarian consortia, in reality little has been seen of such a 
development. Not only the middle peasants but even the small ones have managed 
to hold their ground, whilst nothing has been seen of any developments similar 
to those depicted above. In fact, the very opposite has been the case; recent 
decades have actually witnessed a significant increase in the numbers of 
small-scale holdings in agriculture.</p>

<p class="fst">The course taken by agricultural development has brought a big 
disappointment for the theoreticians of State communism. Whilst, in industry, 
the labour process has acquired an ever more pronounced social character, the 
agricultural economy has, in their opinion, remained isolated and backward. 
Whilst in industry the productive establishments have become ever more "mature" 
for communism, as they perceive it, in the agricultural sector of the economy 
production relations have simply refused to become "mature" in preparation for 
central State administration.</p>

<p class="fst">In the eyes of the State communists, agriculture for this reason 
is and remains an active barrier to the establishment of a communist society. 
Our opinion, on the contrary, is that capitalism is creating the conditions for 
communism in the most thoroughgoing way, in agriculture as well as in the rest 
of the economy. It all depends upon where one's vantage point lies: whether one 
envisages placing the responsibility for the administration of agricultural 
production in the hands of a central government office, or whether one 
understands that it will be carried out be the producers themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">To begin with, it is necessary to examine present-day agriculture 
very carefully. There is no doubt that here we do not find the same colossal 
concentration of production as it has been observed to be the case in industry. 
However, in spite of this fact, agricultural cultivation has become capitalist 
through and through.</p>

<p class="fst">Commodity production is the characteristic hallmark of the 
capitalist mode of production. Commodities are use-values which the producer, 
given the conditions of private ownership of the means of production, does not 
produce for his own use but for the use of others. The producer of commodities 
creates precisely those articles which he himself does not require and he 
consumes precisely those which he himself has not produced. It is in the market 
that the general exchange of commodities takes place. Insofar as the producer of 
commodities has not produced for his own use but for that of society, his labour 
is social labour. In the great social process of exchange, all commodity 
producers are bound together, they live in complete mutual dependence and thus 
form an integral whole.</p>

<p class="fst">For the peasant economy of bygone ages, however, the production 
of commodities was only a subsidiary activity. The isolated domestic economy of 
the peasant satisfied virtually his entire requirements from within its own 
resources. The peasant laboured for his own family circle. His production was 
not socially interdependent. So long as he was able to obtain the tools 
necessary for his production from his own labour, the circle of his productivity 
extended no further than the narrow limits of his farmyard. Only that which was 
not required for his own use, his surplus production, was destined for the 
market, whereby those products then acquired the character of commodities. The 
peasant economy thus formed no part of general social labour, and this also 
provides the explanation for the independent conditions of existence typical of 
the peasantry.</p>

<p class="fst">Commodity production on an industrial scale has broken up these 
isolated economic conditions. Whereas on the one hand capitalism has scattered a 
plethora of cheap products over the entire land, on the other hand the 
development of capitalism has had the effect of raising the average level of 
agricultural rent, whilst simultaneously the State has demanded ever higher 
taxes. It forms no part of our task here to pursue the course through which the 
destruction of the isolated peasant economy has been carried out (see Rosa 
Luxemburg: <i>The Accumulation of Capital</i>). Here we need take note only of 
the result, which has become ever clearer for all to see: <i>the peasant has 
found himself in need of more and more money-capital in order to be able to 
discharge his economic obligations</i>. He can, however, obtain such 
money-capital only be motivating himself as a commodity producer, by bringing 
more and more products to the market. To achieve this aim, two methods were open 
to him: either it was necessary for him to consume less whilst productivity 
remained static; or else he was compelled to raise the productivity of his 
labour. To whittle down his consumption, like a peasant of the old stamp, proved 
to be an impossibility. Thus an increase in productivity presented itself to be 
the sole solution.</p>

<p class="fst">It was at this point that the economists began to go astray on 
their speculations for the future. They assumed the same course of development 
for the agricultural economy as had occurred in industry. In industry, an ever 
higher level of productivity was reached by means of the amalgamation of many 
capitals, by means of ever more modern and more productive machinery which could 
only find application in huge establishments. They believed that the same 
processes of concentration would of necessity take place in agriculture. 
According to this vision, the small and middle peasants were destined in the 
main to disappear, whilst the decisive role in the agricultural economy would 
devolve upon vast agrarian combines.</p>

<p class="fst">In this respect, then, our economists have erred. An 
understandable error perhaps, because they were able to base their forecasts 
only upon the known possibilities. What is especially noteworthy, however, is 
that it was industrial development itself, which in their scheme of things was 
destined to bring about economic concentration in the agricultural economy, 
which in fact prepared the ground for the completely different course taken by 
agrarian development. The chief instruments responsible for raising the 
productivity of agricultural production to such a significant degree were in 
particular <i>the motor vehicle</i>, <i>artificial fertilisers and the 
application of agrarian science</i>. As a result of modern fertilisation methods 
the inherent fertility of the land began to play a subordinate role, the yield 
per hectare grew enormously, by which means the peasant was enabled to deliver a 
much greater volume of commodities to the market than previously, whilst at the 
same time modern methods of communication provided the general means of 
transport. Simultaneous with the increase of the yield per hectare another 
factor of tremendous significance began to play a role. As soon as production 
has been placed on a scientific foundation, the phenomenon of specialisation 
makes its appearance as a compelling imperative. "The specialist, as a 
cave-dweller, perceives only a tiny ray of light in the entire universe, but 
that one ray he sees extremely clearly", says Multatuli, somewhere or other. 
Thus we see that the peasant arranges his affairs in such a way that he supplies 
only one particular product, but in that narrow field he achieves the very 
highest level of productivity of which modern science and his own financial 
resources are capable. He organises his production on the basis of this narrow 
specialisation, that is to say, he procures just those tools and equipment which 
he needs for that specific product.</p>

<p class="fst">The above describes the situation over a large part of Western 
Europe. The characteristics described above are seen in their most pronounced 
form in Holland and Denmark, whilst France, England and Germany follow closely 
behind in the move towards specialisation. In the case of livestock rearing and 
vegetable farming in the immediate environs of the larger cities, the transition 
to this type of agriculture has been carried through to completion in the above 
countries. The peasant, or farmer, has therewith become a commodity producer in 
the fullest sense of the word. <i>He no longer brings merely his surplus product 
to the market</i>, <i>but his whole output</i>. He produces that which he 
himself does not require, and he consumes precisely those products which he 
himself has not created. Thus he labours not for himself, but for others, for 
society, and with the completion of that process his labour has become fully 
integrated with social labour in general. The closed domestic economy has been 
destroyed by specialisation, and the agrarian economy has been transformed into 
a sector of <i>industrial production</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Even if the peasant has remained to some extent the owner of his 
own small piece of land, his general economic situation has, along with this, 
deteriorated to an enormous degree. Nevertheless, under favourable market 
conditions he can still make profitable transactions. The difference is that he 
is now totally dependent upon the fluctuations of the market. Furthermore, he is 
now highly vulnerable to the vagaries of nature, and poor weather conditions in 
one year or disease in a particular crop in the next, or any one among many 
factors outside his control, can ruin him completely.</p>

<p class="fst">These uncertainties of economic experience may indeed also apply 
to the sphere of industrial production - with this important difference, 
however: that the latter in not so strongly dependent upon natural conditions. 
In the case of industry, productivity was increased to such a degree that 
accelerated accumulation was made possible through the application of ever more 
productive machinery, the final outcome of which was a process of concentration 
of industrial holdings. In the case of agriculture, however, increases in 
productivity held for the peasant a totally different significance, one which 
nevertheless was also dependent on the level of technology in combination with 
the specific production conditions in the individual farm enterprises. In the 
case of agriculture, accumulation was made possible through the availability of 
artificial fertilisers, motor vehicles and tractors and the organisation of 
production around a specialised product.</p>

<p class="fst">Hand in hand with the above developments a further phenomenon 
made its appearance. In order to achieve as strong a position in the market as 
possible, the peasants combined into peasant cooperatives, by which means they 
were enabled to exert a closer control over price policy and so were able by 
collective means to procure improved machinery for soil preparation and 
harvesting. Thus livestock farmers, for instance, were able to establish for 
themselves dairy farms, which became the means by which this industry was 
directly integrated with that of livestock rearing. As a result, dairy farming 
has now become the focal centre dominating a wide circle of subordinate forms of 
production. In this way the farmers have created an organ which indissolubly 
binds them all together. By these means not only arable farming and livestock 
rearing, but also horticulture have become strongly concentrated, whilst at the 
same time there can be no question of any amalgamation of enterprises in the 
industrial sense of the word having taken place.</p>

<p class="fst">In summarising the above, it must be observed that contemporary 
agriculture is characterised by a strong degree of specialisation and has also 
developed into the stage of full commodity production for the market. Increases 
in production were made possible by modern technology, without however bringing 
about any equivalent and simultaneous degree of concentration in the ownership 
of enterprises. A parallel development has been the growth of peasant 
cooperatives, which link the various separate farming enterprises together by 
creating areas of common economic interest. At the same time, this leads to a 
loss of independence on the part of the peasants (for instance, the frequent 
loss of the right to dispose as they wish of their product).</p>
