<h4>CHAPTER 13</h4>
<h1><a name="h0">The Economic Power of the Proletariat and the System of General Accounting 
Control</a></h1>

<p class="fst">The economic control of the proletariat - what a dreaded spectre 
this conjures up for so many brave petit-bourgeois - and even for large numbers 
of the proletariat itself! They forget that the capitalist class exercises its 
power with the most brutal ruthlessness. History, however, does not revolve 
around the terrors of the petit-bourgeois, it was and remains a history of class 
struggles, and for this reason the proletarian class, whose very well-springs of 
meaningful life are continually threatened, will be compelled to raise itself up 
against the dictatorship of capital in order that it might establish its own 
social order, the order of labour, against the resistance of all bourgeois 
elements. The decisive force necessary for this act must from necessity proceed 
from the masses of workers who are concentrated in large and middle industry. It 
is they who will seize hold of the civil power in society, and it is also they 
to whom will fall the task of laying down the new order which the rest of 
society, the non-proletarian elements, will have to follow. This cannot be made 
effective by means of decrees or, still less, with the tip of the bayonet, but 
must be made reality through the organised activity of the broadest masses of 
the workers.</p>

<p class="fst">The course of revolutionary events in Western Europe will be such 
that the proletariat takes possession of the factories and other productive 
establishments and declares them to be social property. In this way the State 
itself is progressively undermined and finally destroyed. Having achieved this, 
however, the workers will then have to decide whether they will follow the 
Russian example and, bowing to the influence of long-established 
social-democratic doctrines, help to set up a new apparatus of oppression 
exercised through the State, which will thereafter function as the manager and 
administrator of production; or, on the other hand, if a communist consciousness 
among the workers is so strong as to make revolutionary action both possible and 
necessary, to take the factories and industrial elements forcibly under their 
own administration, using for this purpose the factory organisations or Councils 
as the essential organs of their power. Should the latter course occur, then 
this will only be possible if the principles of communist economy, as sketched 
in this book, come to form the foundation of the system of social production. By 
this means the most important part of the total social product will be taken 
outside the scope of free uncontrolled circulation within the orbit of the 
market. The lesser remaining part of social production, that of small peasant 
agriculture, will then be persuaded by the objective conditions themselves to 
associate itself with collectively organised industry. In this way there would 
come into being the "economic dictatorship of the proletariat", the strongest 
weapon of the victorious working-class.</p>

<p class="fst">It can be readily perceived that the carrying through of the 
social revolution in the sphere of the economy is a task which to a considerable 
extent falls to the system of general social book-keeping. The new economic laws 
which would then have validity make the fulfilment of this task possible.</p>

<p class="fst">Communist industrial life knows nothing of the circulation of 
money and has no market. It administers the stream of recorded exchanges by 
means of the office of social book-keeping (Giro-Centre). By this means all 
those producers who are not associated with the office of social book-keeping 
are brought into a situation of negative persuasion. They are unable to procure 
any raw materials and means of production for their establishments. Should they 
wish those establishments to continue in industrial activity, then the 
circulation of their manufactured goods must take place through the exchange 
control (Giro Centre) established by the OSB. They must subordinate themselves 
to and participate in the general system of social production and must place 
that production under the discipline of the general system of control 
implemented through the prescribed formula (p + c) + L, the instrument through 
which their production is placed under social control.</p>

<p class="fst">By this means socially scattered and fragmented small-scale 
industry is compelled by purely economic means to bring its production into line 
with the general proletarian order. The necessary consequence of this will be 
that industrial establishments of a similar scale and size will. join together 
in production groups. If for no other reason, this will be necessary in order 
that the various Average Social Production Times (ASPT's) and the respective 
Productivity Factors associated with them may be determined, as well as for 
reasons relating to the planned procurement of materials, etc. <i>This method of 
group cartelisation</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>need not deprive the small 
industrial or agricultural establishments in any way of their right to 
self-administration;</i> on the contrary, practice will show that the 
organisation of production by the producers themselves will develop in an 
exemplary way in this sphere also.</p>

<p class="fst">It is by this means that the Association of Free and Equal 
Producers exercises its economic might. It rejects all recognition of the right 
to exploitation, and excludes from its society each and every element which does 
not recognise this first principle of communism. Small-scale production, 
however, is compelled to join itself to the communist system of production. 
Nevertheless, it is directly by means of this joining that the proletarian 
economic might transforms itself into its opposite. So soon as the producers 
themselves take the reigns of management and administration of their industrial 
establishments into their own hands and place production under social control, 
by that very act the 'dictatorship' has abolished itself and all producers have 
become equal members within the great community of their Association.</p>
