<h3><a name="h1">The Declaration of War on European Capital</a></h3>

<p>A short while ago there appeared in Italy a brochure giving a resume of a 
large number of articles from the largest Japanese daily, <i>The Osaka Mainichi 
and the Tokio Nichi</i>. In it we find the following:</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;You Europeans, and especially you Englishmen, have made it 
nice for yourselves, following the great industrial development at the end of 
the preceding and beginning of the present century; you have raised the standard 
of living and have counted upon the world export-trade as upon an eternal right. 
The world does not, however, stand still, nor does it wait on you if you fail to 
keep pace with the times. We do not hesitate to affirm that the English and, in 
general, the European textile industry is being beaten every day by that of 
Japan, because you have forgotten that the whole basis of trade consists in 
selling at low prices. The purchasing power of most of the countries with which 
you do business is rather slight, and for that reason we maintain that the 
Japanese design of selling their commodities at the lowest prices - regarded 
from the general human point of view - is more beneficial than your tendency to 
stick to high prices.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;You Englishmen and Europeans think of your earnings and the 
high standard of living of your workers; we think of the necessity of finding 
work for our workers and of the vital need on the part of the millions of 
Asians, Africans, South Americans - our customers - who lead a more than modest 
existence. If Japan can sell these peoples a fabric at two cents a yard, why 
should they pay the Europeans four or six?&#8221;</p>

<p>These are the words of Japanese capital, grown power-conscious and engaged in 
defeating western capitalism with its own logic. With the same logic and the 
same humanitarian phrases, European capital once destroyed European handicraft, 
as it also later seized the markets of backward countries and imposed its 
economic methods upon Asia. Today it raises against the force created by it the 
same wishy-washy phrases of an economically surpassed petty-bourgeois morality 
with which the expiring handicraftsmen sought to defend themselves against its 
competition. The modern and more efficient capital of the East, with 
self-conscious brutality, declared war on European capitalism, its creator. And 
this declaration of war is clearer than all the utterances of the imperialistic 
warriors of the Japanese General Staff. In its spirit will Japanese capital not 
only fight; it will defeat with that spirit the dilapidated capitalism of Europe 
in the field of international economy.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h2">The Technical Preconditions of Japanese Expansion</a></h3>

<p>The European bourgeoisie points bitterly and with fear to the &#8220;dumping&#8221; on 
the part of the Japanese exporters. With what justification remains to 
determine. </p>

<p>It must be emphasized in the first place, that the question as to the 
strength of Japanese exports is not answered with general phrases about dumping. 
That is to say, it is quite incontestable that Japanese capitalism has a 
technical equipment which is far superior to that of Europe. This holds above 
all, of the textile industry. It is true that the costs of setting up a textile 
factory in Eastern Asia are four times as high as in England, but on the other 
hand, Japan practices a much more intense utilization of her machinery. The 
highly modern Japanese textile machines regularly run in two shifts of 8½ hours 
each, and at highest speed. A ten year-old Japanese textile machine has worked 
an average of 62,000 hours, while a similar English machine has been put to use 
only an average of 24,000 hours. The average number of labor hours per week is 
reported (1932) as 100 for Japan, as against 40 in Europe.</p>

<p>The intensity of the machine labor hour in Japan is greater than in England. 
Thus a Japanese spindle turns out in 48 hours an average of 42 lbs. of thread 
No. 40; an English spindle only 36 lbs. Japan, with eight million spindles, 
attains almost the output of the English textile industry with 50 million 
spindles.</p>

<p>The tempo of labor rationalization is so high in Japan that in spite of the 
increasing productivity the number of workers has remained practically 
stationary at 4.8 millions the last ten years. While in 1929 10,000 spindles 
were served by 285 workers in the cotton industry, in 1933 the same number of 
spindles was left to 197 workers. In the same space of time, the output of a 
spinner increased by 35.6 percent.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h3">The &#8220;currency dumping&#8221;</a></h3>

<p>While the highly rational utilization of man and machine, together with the 
concentration upon a relatively few kinds of thread and fabric, not only in the 
cotton but also in the wool and artificial silk industry, may put Japan in a 
position, even from this merely technical point of view, successfully to meet 
the European and American competition, still Japan has a further advantage in 
the controlled devaluation of her currency. This devaluation alone does not in 
the least explain the success of her export trade, and England has no right 
whatever to raise a howl on that score. For, in the first place, the devaluation 
of the English currency took place prior to that of the yen, and secondly, the 
yen was again stabilized on the basis of the English pound. The English example 
has further shown that a cheapening of currency has only a brief stimulating 
effect upon the economy, while Japan&#8217;s success is a long-term affair. Her 
announcement of the possibility of a new devaluation experiment is evidence, at 
any rate, of the will to administer, if need be, a new shot of adrenalin to 
Japanese economy; an experiment which England would hardly venture to follow.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h4">Japanese Wages</a></h3>

<p>One of the essential reasons for the low prices of Japanese exports is the 
Japanese wages. In Japan, the commodity labor power is to be had cheap, even 
though the Japanese wages, in comparison with those in fascist Germany and 
fascist Italy fail to reveal that enormous difference which is proclaimed by the 
European press in the interest of its own entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>The Japanese statistical bureau has computed an average daily wage of 2.53 
yen (1 yen is equal to about 50c) 714,600 male, and of 0.95 yen for 729,000 
female workers. The Bank of Japan has indicated as average monthly wage of male 
workers in the metal industry 59.21 yen; in the provisions industry 42.88 yen; 
in the chemical industry 41.93 yen; in the textile industry 32.05 yen; and for 
various other branches of industry 44.95 yen. The reported wages for women vary 
between 23.22 yen in the metal industry and 15.22 yen in the textile industry, 
and in no case do they amount to as much as 50 percent of the wages for men.</p>

<p>These data, which in themselves are quite unreliable, do not permit an exact 
comparison with wages in Europe. In the first place, according to an article by 
Oliver Lawrence in <i>The Listener</i> (London), beginning of March 1934, a 
considerable part of the wage is paid in kind. And secondly, a large number of 
the women workers, as in the textile industry, is barracked and accordingly has 
no rent to pay.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h5">Standard of Living</a></h3>

<p>Japanese wages embody a different standard of living from that of the 
European workers. The city administration of Tokio has established a mean budget 
for workers, which comes to 54 yen per month. That is more than corresponds to 
the average income of all categories of workers apart from those of the metal 
industry. It is no doubt for this reason that the Japanese statisticians have 
preferred to make the different computation of income on a family basis. In 
statistics on incomes and expenditures of 1,000 households - statistics which 
after all are strongly biased - they arrive in this way at an average net 
workers&#8217; income of 77.97 yen per month, and give to understand that 4.89 yen of 
this amount is saved.</p>

<p>That is paltry, to say the least, when it is borne in mind that saving in 
Japan has to take the place of social insurance. For the lowest category of the 
households considered, which show an income of less than 50 yen, this 
computation itself is bound to establish a monthly deficit of 4.34 yen. A 
comparison between the Japanese wage index and the index of retail prices shows 
that the living conditions of the Japanese workers, in spite of increasing 
industrialization and mounting exports, is absolutely being worsened. From 
November 1931 to September 1933 the wage index fell from 89.7 to 84.7, while the 
retail index rose from 130 to 147.</p>

<p>The devaluation of the yen has had no influence, according to Japanese data, 
upon the workers&#8217; standard of living, since the prices to be paid for the 
necessities of life have not changed. A comparison of the wage and price index, 
however, says the opposite. It remains to be considered that the necessary 
foodstuffs for the Japanese workers are limited to rice, fish, tea and a bit of 
alcohol, and that the rice price index has dropped considerably in the course of 
the year 1933. The extremely modest costs for the restoration of the commodity 
labor power account for the low wages in Japan. Taking for granted the standard 
of living prevailing in the East - a standard conditioned by historical and 
climatic factors - and bearing in mind the other living conditions in Europe, it 
can be said that the starvation wages of Japan are not essentially different 
from the starvation wages of large sections of the workers of Europe. European 
capitalism, however, nevertheless fails to find itself in a position to compete 
with the Japanese wage level, unless by bringing its whole working population to 
the level of income and life prevailing among the German farm hands and in the 
German labor service, where wages have practically been abolished.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h6">Woman and Child Labor</a></h3>

<p>The &#8220;rice standard&#8221; of the Japanese workers cuts down the Japanese wage fund 
in a measure which is still unattainable to European capitalism, even with equal 
or even greater relative impoverishment of its workers. The great prevalence of 
woman and child labor, which makes the attainment of the existence minimum 
dependent on the labor of the whole family, presses the wage level far down in 
the scale.</p>

<p>In spite of high technical pretensions, the Japanese workers are intensively 
exploited in the highly rationalized production process. This becomes socially 
possible as Japanese capitalism has at its disposal a reserve army capable of 
being enormously expanded. By reason of the great growth of population alone, 
some 200,000 workers are added to it each year. And on the other side there is 
the highly impoverished peasantry, which makes up the largest part of the 
Japanese population: an inexhaustible human reservoir.</p>

<p>This human reservoir lives in pre-capitalistic working and exploiting 
conditions. Since the Japanese bourgeoisie did not grow up in struggle with the 
feudal forces in the country districts, but arose through the division of the 
reigning feudal class, the feudal-agrarian subsoil of Japanese society has been 
widely maintained. The greatest families of the feudal nobility are at the same 
time those who carry on the concentrated Japanese industry and are the 
beneficiaries of a peasant exploitation which amounts practically to serfdom. 
The feudal dependence of the Japanese peasants is concealed, as in large parts 
of China, behind rent-in-kind relations. It is customary for the peasant in 
Japan to turn over 50 percent of his crops as rent to the land owner. Since the 
highly modern industry and the half-feudal agriculture are bound up with each 
other in the closest possible manner, Japanese capitalism is a direct 
beneficiary of the feudal exploitation of the peasants. It pockets such extra 
profits as fall to imperialist capital from the sucking dry of the 
pre-capitalist producers in other colonial regions, without being obliged to 
share with the feudal class and the other innumerable intermediary agents. 
Though the winnings of the Japanese entrepreneurs are in many cases fabulous (in 
the artificial silk industry, for example, it was possible to denote yearly 
profits of 75 percent as the rule), there stands at the disposal of Japanese 
capital a considerable feudal income, which it is free to employ in the 
competitive struggle on the international plane.</p>

<p>In this respect, also, it is hardly permissible to speak of a genuine &#8220;social 
dumping&#8221;. Japanese capitalism merely makes use of its position - a position 
attained by the means and methods which otherwise have been applied by 
imperialist capital to colonial territory.</p>

<p>For the Japanese workers, the old feudal relations have become a further 
fetter. On the one hand, through the attachment to the land, the care of the 
unemployed, in spite of extreme impoverishment, becomes &#8220;superfluous&#8221;. On the 
other hand, the recruiting and engaging of workers goes on in half-feudal form. 
Agents of the great enterprises round up in the villages whole ship and train 
loads of labor volunteers to whom a cash payment is made forthwith when they 
have bound themselves to work for several years. This business is usually closed 
with the head of the family; which is to say that a wild form of trade in human 
beings has developed out of the patriarchal family relations.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h7">Permanent Agrarian Crisis</a></h3>

<p>In Japan, as in general where similar conditions prevail, the position of the 
peasant grows worse at an extremely rapid rate, for in addition to the yoke of 
feudal exploitation there was laid upon them also that of capital. At the very 
beginning of the world economic crisis, in the train of a 20 percent wage cut 
and through the return of numerous discharged factory workers to the country, 
the discontent was manifested in strong agrarian uprisings. The partial boom 
occurring in 1931 failed to bring any satisfactory relief. The prices of 
important farm products such as rice, beans, tea and raw silk, did not keep pace 
with the devaluation of the yen. In the course of the year 1933, this 
development again became critical, and accordingly the Government, in the autumn 
of 1933, attempted to ease the agrarian situation, but without real success, 
through extensive purchases of rice. In June 1934 the Japanese agricultural 
association published alarming reports: it established that 10 to 15 percent of 
the peasants no longer had any rice supplies for their personal needs, and that 
the percentage of the famishing in the areas of silkworm culture was still 
greater. It further became known that the peasants had broken open some of the 
Government&#8217;s rice houses and put these supplies into distribution. The 
Government is not in a position to remove the causes of the agrarian 
impoverishment. Any considerable increases in the price of rice would make it 
impossible to continue maintaining the present wage rates and, with them, the 
intensified attack on the rivals in the world market. Furthermore, the peasant 
impoverishment is not to be combatted so much by way of higher prices for rice 
as through the setting aside of the lease slavery. And the ruling class of Japan 
will not of its own accord disrupt the basis of its economic power. In view of 
this fact, there falls to the working peasants of Japan, who make up roughly 54 
percent of the Japanese population, a special social significance. The question 
of beating down the ruling powers of Japan, as in Russia prior to 1917, is not 
alone a question of the workers&#8217; struggle, but at the same time a peasant 
question. So long as the ruling class of Japan succeeds in maintaining the 
feudal-agrarian basis of the country, so long is it not only secured at home, 
but also enjoys a considerable advantage on the world market.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h8">The Japanese State</a></h3>

<p>Through the close social and family ties uniting the feudal and the 
capitalistic powers, which are intertwined in closest manner with the State by 
reason of inherited religion and manners as well as by reason of their 
interests, the Japanese State has become their ideal instrument both politically 
and economically. This is proved not only by the policy of imperialist conquests 
in Eastern Asia, a policy which serves far-flung political and economic aims in 
the striving for power. This is proved also by the support which the state 
extends to Japanese exports. Though the state administration is under heavy 
strain as a result of the military budget, which in the preliminary estimate for 
1934-35 embraces no less than 45 percent of all state expenditures, the Japanese 
state still has considerable means at its disposal for promoting exportation. In 
the first place, the Japanese shipping firms have adjustable freight rates. When 
by reason of the freight to a distant market the Japanese commodities would have 
to be sold dearer than at least five percent under the lowest competing prices, 
the freight rate is lowered or even, in certain circumstances, directly made 
inoperative. Any losses of the shipping firms, moreover, are covered by the 
State through subsidies. It is this system which conceals an actual dumping. 
This dumping is possible because Japanese industry operates with large earnings. 
The increasing expenditures of the State are raised, not by way of mounting 
taxes, but by way of increasing loans. Of more than 2.1 billion yen provided in 
the new budget, not less than 1 billion are raised through treasury notes while 
the taxes still bring in less than 700 million yen. Japan&#8217;s national debt 
amounts to 10 billions. It remains to be seen whether the Government will 
succeed in the long run in keeping up such a financing system, which would be 
ruinous to any other State, and on the other hand, in spite of all the 
tensities, succeed in maintaining, even by force, the equilibrium on the 
agrarian field.</p>

<p>To the methods of transportational dumping belong also those of an indirect 
state subvention to Japanese industry through state contracts. For armaments, 
railway constructions, etc., for which the State lets contracts, excess prices 
are paid by which the entrepreneurs in question are enabled to set low prices on 
exports. As regards the silk and steel industry, this system has been officially 
admitted.</p>

<p>On investigating the character of these methods of export subvention through 
the policy of adjusting transportation costs and through the over-valuation of 
army and state contracts, one arrives at the following basic fact: Japan&#8217;s 
export power is due to her extraordinarily high capitalist concentration, which 
is explained by the very manner in which Japanese industrialism arose. A great 
number of enterprises was founded by the State, and then, when they had become 
profitable, turned over to private capital - and without exception, into the 
family possession of the military nobility. Five family concerns, in the hands 
of the old military nobility, have under them approximately 75 percent of all 
Japanese industry. This industry, furthermore, is cartellized in the strictest 
manner, so that there exists in Japan such a direct interlacing of all 
enterprises among each other, on the one hand, and with the State on the other, 
as can be met with elsewhere only in Soviet Russia. And that on a profit and 
private-economy basis. The financing of the State on the one hand, and the 
financial promotion of export by the State on the other, turns out to be a sort 
of unified, organized action of Japanese capitalism.</p>

<p>This impression is still further strengthened on considering that the whole 
export system is <i>organized</i> by the State. Not only are the prices, the 
quantity and the quality of the export products established from a central 
bureau, but, in addition thereto, the working up of the foreign markets and the 
conducting of the flow of exports itself is centralized and organized. Japanese 
capitalism has been incomparably more successful than that of any other country 
in taking hold, as organized capital, of the state apparatus and as an organized 
group in going to meet the competing groups of the other countries.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3><a name="h9">Conclusion</a></h3>

<p>It has not been possible here to present either exhaustive material or a 
factual and all-sided analysis of Japanese capitalism, but only points to be 
borne in mind for that purpose. But at any rate it may have become clear that 
the power of the youthful Japanese capitalism is anchored not alone in the 
forced application of the general and well-known capitalist-imperialistic 
methods, but furthermore in the special structure of its exploitation economy.</p>

<p>Japan will certainly not be able to get away from the contradictions of her 
own development; not only that, but she will not succeed in avoiding either the 
laws of antagonistic profit economy itself, nor the opposition between modern 
capitalist production and feudal appropriation in agriculture. But so long as 
she is in a position to maintain her social stability itself and to assure 
herself the double basis of her profit economy, so long will she also be in a 
position to draw from a new crisis the new forces for overcoming it. She is 
merely at the beginning of a mighty imperialist attack which she is carrying on 
both by military and economic means against the old capitalist powers. It is 
probable that she will emerge as victor from the coming conflicts and will 
become the deciding force of world-capitalist progress generally for the near 
future &#8211; if her way is not barred by the uprising of the international 
proletariat, or if she is not hurled back by the peasant revolution of Asia.</p>
