<h3>Rise and fall</h3>

<p class="fst">As the society of revolutionary Russia gradually hardened into 
its new shape in the years after 1918 and political power was increasingly 
concentrated - due in part to the violence of war and economic crisis - in the 
hands of a bureaucratic elite, oppositional movements continually emerged, both 
inside Russia and abroad, that sought to turn the tide.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> Karl Korsch in 
Germany, Amadeo Bordiga in Italy and Timofei Sapronov in Russia tried and failed 
to form a new international in 1926, for example.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a> From 1930 on, the 
'Bukharinite' opposition (Heinrich Brandler, Jay Lovestone, M.N. Roy and others) 
made a similar attempt. Trotsky's International Left Opposition, whose formation 
in 1930, eventually led to the foundation of the Fourth International in 1938, 
became the best known of such projects.</p>

<p class="fst">One very early protest against the trends in Russia was expressed 
in the Netherlands and Germany by former Bolshevik sympathisers who would later 
become known as 'council communists' - a term that was probably used from 1921 
on.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> The most prominent spokespeople of this protest were the German educator 
Otto Rühle (1874-1943) and two Dutchmen; the poet and classicist Herman Gorter 
(1864-1927) and the astronomer Anton(ie) Pannekoek (1873-1960). These 
intellectuals had initially been enthusiastic admirers of developments in 
Russia. Gorter, for example, dedicated his 1918 pamphlet The World Revolution 
'To Lenin', the revolutionary who 'stands out above all other leaders of the 
Proletariat' and for whom 'Marx is his only peer'. A year later, Pannekoek still 
asserted, 'In Russia communism has been put into practice for two years now'<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But their mood changed quickly. The most important reason for 
their turnabout was the efforts of the Communist International established in 
1919 to promote the Bolshevik example as an international model. In 1920, 
Pannekoek published his pamphlet World Revolution and Communist Tactics, in 
which he defended the proposition that revolutionaries in Western Europe should 
use very different tactics from their comrades in Russia. In Western Europe, the 
influence of an old, experienced bourgeoisie made itself felt at every level of 
society. In Russia and Eastern Europe, by contrast, the bourgeoisie was still 
young and relatively weak. For this reason, East-European workers had fewer 
ideological prejudices and were more receptive to Marxist ideas. Accordingly, 
the struggle against bourgeois institutions such as parliaments and trade unions 
had to be central in the West.</p>

<p class="fst">In his pamphlet 'Left-Wing' Communism - An Infantile Disorder, 
Lenin refuted the Dutch and German left-wingers' standpoints.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> He considered 
that Pannekoek (K. Horner) and his fellow thinkers were spreading confusion. 
While he acknowledged that there was an 'enormous difference' between 'backward 
Russia' and 'the advanced countries of Western Europe', he considered the 
universal significance of the Russian experience far more important: 'it is the 
Russian model that reveals to all countries something - and something highly 
significant - of their near and inevitable future'.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> By focusing centrally an 
'the international validity' of 'certain fundamental features of our revolution' 
in this way, Lenin accentuated the sharpening contradictions within the 
international Communist movement. Intense debates arose inside West-European 
Communist Parties.</p>

<p class="fst">Within the German Party (KPD), this conflict was exacerbated by 
another development. The organisation's leadership, headed by Paul Levi, a 
long-time associate of the recently murdered Rosa Luxemburg, pushed a decision 
through its October 1919 congress that all members had to take part in 
parliamentary elections and fight the union bureaucracy from inside the trade 
unions. This new line was, in practice, tantamount to declaring a split, since 
the left wieg could never be expected to accept it. The result, in any case, was 
that the KPD lost about half of its hundred thousand members within a few 
months. In some districts, such as Greater Berlin, the Northwest (Hamburg and 
Bremen), Lower Saxony (Hanover) and East Saxony (Dresden), the organisation was 
virtually wiped out.</p>

<p class="fst">At first, the expelled opposition did not want to found a new 
party of its own. But, when the KPD leadership acted hesitantly in the early 
stages of the right-wing Kapp Putsch in March 1920 and seemed isolated from the 
militant sections of the working class, the decision was taken to establish a 
rival organisation. On 4-5 April 1920, the Communist Workers' Party of Germany 
(KAPD) was accordingly founded. At its inception, it had 38,000 members. As 
early as February 1920, the General Workers' Union (AAUD) was founded, an 
organisation modelled to some extent as the Industrial Workers of the World 
(IWW) of the US, which many saw as a trade-union federation linked to the KAPD. 
The KAPD flourished briefly. Its high point was probably in August 1920, when it 
had about 40,000 members.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> From then on, the Party was decimated by a series 
of splits and splinter groups. The coup de gräce came in March 1922, with the 
division between a 'Berlin current' and an 'Essen current'.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> By the end of 
1924, the two groups together had only 2,700 members left.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD operated initially on the assumption that the 
international Communist movement could still be reformed from within. But, when 
the KAPD delegation's attempts during the Third Comintern Congress in Moscow 
(Dune-July 1921) to form an international left opposition failed, the decision 
was immediately taken to build a new Communist Workers' International (KAI, 
sometimes referred to as the Fourth International), even though a large tendency 
within the Party (which would later become the 'Berlin current') considered this 
initiative premature. On a programmatic level, the KAI took Herman Gorter's 
propositions in his recent Open Letter to Comrade Lenin, which were, in fact, 
mainly a repetition of the arguments made by Pannekoek, as its starting point. 
Outside Germany, the KAI was chiefly supported by very small political groups, 
such as the Dutch sister organisation KAPN, a British group around Sylvia 
Pankhurst, and the Bulgarian Communist Workers' Party around the journal 
Rabotchnik Iskra.</p>

<p class="fst">Within the council-communist movement - which gradually became 
more diverse as a result of the disintegration of the KAPD - criticism of Russia 
rapidly grew more intense. East-Saxon spokesperson Otto Rühle was perhaps the 
first to conclude that the Bolsheviks were not building socialism. Rühle had 
been a KAPD delegate to the Second Comintern Congress in mid-1920, but had left 
in protest even before the Congress began. Once back in Germany, he gave vent to 
his dismay. The Bolsheviks had tried to skip over an entire epoch by leaping 
directly from feudalism to socialism. The delayed world revolution had made this 
attempt a failure. The outcome was 'a frightful disappointment'.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> The 
Bolsheviks had instituted an ultra-centralism that corresponded completely to 
the bourgeois character of their revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">Centralism is the organizational principle of the 
bourgeois-capitalist epoch. By this means a bourgeois state and capitalist 
economy can be constructed. A proletarian state and socialist economy cannot, 
however. They require the system of councils.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Within a fairly short time, this opinion of Rühle's was generally 
accepted in KAPD circles.</p>

<p class="fst">In the course of 1921, the council-communist movement thus began 
to demarcate itself clearly from official Communism. The movement's starting 
points can be summarised simply. Firstly, capitalism is in decline and should be 
abolished immediately. Secondly, the only alternative to capitalism is a 
democracy of workers' councils, based on an economy controlled by the working 
class. Thirdly, the bourgeoisie and its social-democratic allies are trying to 
save capitalism from its fate by means of 'democratic' manipulation of the 
working class. Fourthly, in order to hasten the establishment of a democracy of 
councils, this manipulation must be consistently resisted. This means, on the 
one hand, boycotting all parliamentary elections and, on the other hand, 
systematically fighting against the old trade unions (which are organs for joint 
management of capitalism). Finally, Soviet-type societies are not an alternative 
to capitalism but, rather, a new form of capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">These five starting points are the parameters within which 
debates have taken place among council communists over the past eighty years. 
There has been considerable room for fundamental differences of opinion within 
these parameters, however. The differences have also been sharpened by the 
movement's ongoing decline, which reduced the remaining council communists to 
small groups. In these groups, intemal theoretical debate has often been more 
important than practical political work.</p>

<p class="fst">Organised council communism disappeared from the scene in Germany 
after Hitler seized power in 1933, although groups remained active in the 
resistance.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a> In the Netherlands, several small groups developed, one of 
which, the Groups of International Communists (GIC), continued to serve as a 
co-ordinating centre for international discussions until the late 1930s and, 
among other things, published a journal (Rätekorrespondenz, 1934-7) towards this 
end. Several texts appeared in the early issues of this periodical that 
subsequently functioned more or less as the substantive platform of the 
international movement. The first such text was 'The Rise of a New Labour 
Movement' by Dutch educator Henk Canne Meijer (1890-1962), who can justly be 
seen as the GIC's 'soul'.<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> Canne Meijer explained that the historical role of 
the whole of the old labour movement (made up of parties, trade unions and 
co-operatives) was exhausted and that a new labour movement was now rising up, 
based entirely an autonomous proletarian activity.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A second influential text was the German journalist and teacher 
Helmut Wagner's (1904-89) 'Theses an Bolshevism'. Wagner characterised the 
Soviet Union as state capitalism without a bourgeoisie, constantly zigzagging 
between the interests of workers and peasants. The Five Year Plans and forced 
collectivisation were nothing but attempts to keep the contradiction between 
these two classes under control by force.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Wagner still assumed that the Bolsheviks had followed incorrect 
policies in an effort to build socialism. Anton Pannekoek came a few years later 
to a different conclusion, that the Bolsheviks had carried out a bourgeois 
revolution, so that, rather than following incorrect policies, they had followed 
the only possible policies. Their only 'mistake' had been to imagine that they 
were building socialism rather than capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">A former KAPD member who emigrated to the United States in 1926, 
metalworker Paul Mattick (1904-81), began to build up an operation of his own in 
Chicago in the early 1930s.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a> He was, among other things, the driving force 
behind the journal International Council Correspondence.<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> In Australia, J.A. 
Dawson (1889-1958) published the Southern Advocate of Workers' Councils for 
several years just after the Second World War,<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a> while Lain Diez published 
council-communist texts in Chile. From time to time, an independent Marxist 
thinker seemed to develop in a council-communist direction, as with the 
ex-Communist lawyer and philosopher Karl Korsch (1886-1961) from the early 1930s 
on.</p>

<p class="fst">Council communism enjoyed several years back a bit of the 
limelight while the student movement was flourishing in the 1960s, particularly 
in Germany, Italy and France. Classic texts were republished and 'veterans' such 
as Mattick and the Dutch journalist Cajo Brendel (born in 1915 and perhaps the 
last true disciple of Pannekoek) were popular speakers and writers. The 'old' 
council communism was often integrated in a more or less eclectic way into a 
'new' theory or worldview. That was apparent early an in the case of Daniel and 
Gabriel Cohn-Bendit's book, Le gauchisme: remède à la maladie sénile du 
communisme.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> With the decline of the '1968 movements', council communism also 
largely disappeared from sight once more, although groups are still active in 
various places in Western Europe and North America.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a></p>

<h3>Debates</h3>

<p class="fst">There have been numerous internal debates among council 
communists since the 1920s. Here, I confine myself to a brief outline of the 
most important controversies.</p>

<h4>i. Characterisation of the historical period</h4>

<p class="fst">What exactly does the proposition that capitalism is in decline 
signify? In the 1920s and 1930s, many Marxists (council communists and others) 
thought that capitalism was very close to the end of its tether. This opinion 
was often backed up with references to Rosa Luxemburg's theory that, in having 
conquered the whole planet, capitalism had reached its historical limit. In the 
late 1920s, a second theory was added to the argument, based an Henryk 
Grossmann's book an the collapse of capitalism.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> Grossmann had used Marx's 
reproduction schemes to show that the rising organic composition of capital 
automatically leads to the accumulation process's grinding to a halt, and that 
capitalism has therefore an objective internal limit. Grossmann's opinion was 
the subject of fierce debates among council communists in the early 1930s. 
Korsch and Pannekoek, among others, rejected Grossmann's approach, while Mattick 
defended its key points.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> Pannekoek argued that socialism would come into 
existence, not because capitalism would collapse and thus force workers to form 
new organisations, but, rather, because capitalism would become more and more 
unbearable for the workers and thus spur them on to form new organisations that 
would make capitalism collapse. Mattick, by contrast, considered Pannekoek's 
line of argument sophistry, because capitalist collapse and revolutionary class 
struggle are two sides of the same coin: ongoing concentration of capital would 
lead to prolonged immiseration for the workers, transforming their economic 
struggle into a revolutionary struggle. Saying that the collapse of capitalism 
was inevitable was thus exactly the same as saying that the revolution was 
inevitable.</p>

<p class="fst">Such debates naturally seemed much less urgent during the long 
post-Second-World-War boom. Now, the central question became how to interpret 
the boom. No single council communist believed that capitalism had found a way 
after all to keep its fundamental contradictions under control. They were all 
convinced, rather, that the 'golden years' only meant a postponement of the day 
of reckoning. The theoretical and political challenge was above all to analyse 
the boom as a temporary phenomenon. Paul Mattick, in particular, took this task 
upon himself. As early as the late 1930s, he began to develop a critique of John 
Maynard Keynes, culminating in his magnum opus Marx and Keynes in 1969. 
According to Mattick, Marx had not foreseen that a Keynesian period of extensive 
state economic intervention would occur (though Marx's theory in no way ruled 
out such a possibility). Keynesianism 'silently accepted' Marx's opinion about 
capitalism's immanent crises, and, at the same time, offered a remedy in the 
form of conscious interference with the mechanism of the market.<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> This 
remedy could not possibly solve the structural problem of capital accumulation, 
however, because increased state intervention led to more wasteful production 
(of weapons and so forth) and public works. Even if additional markets were 
created for capital in this way,</p>

<p class="quoteb">"... the final product of government-induced production, resulting 
from a long chain of intermediary production processes, does not have the form 
of a commodity which could profitably be sold an the market."<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Government deficit spending is therefore 'not part of the actual 
aggregate demand, but a deliberate policy of producing beyond it'.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a> This 
policy, based an a continual increase in the national debt (and, consequently, a 
steady depreciation of incomes and debts), was bound to reach a dead end at a 
certain point.</p>

<p class="fst">Notwithstanding the long duration of rather 'prosperous' 
conditions in the industrially-advanced countries, there is no ground for the 
assumption that capitalist production has overcome its inherent contradictions 
through state interventions in the economy.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Mattick was also alert to some possible non-economic consequences 
of post-war capitalism, as shown by the attention he devoted, much earlier than 
many other Marxists, to ecological issues. In 1976, he devoted an essay to 'the 
ongoing destruction of the environment'. He argued that threats to the human 
habitat were not the result of the development of the productive forces, but, 
rather, of capitalist relations of production and their 'monstrous waste of 
human labor power and natural resources'<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a> At the same time Mattick did not 
exclude the possibility of capitalism finding a solution to the threat an its 
own:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Since the way the world moves is determined by profit, 
capitalists concern themselves with ecological problems only inasmuch as they 
have an impact an profits. The capitalists have no particular interest in 
destroying the world; if it turns out that preserving the world can be 
profitable too, then protecting the world will also become a business."<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a></p>

<h4>ii. Revolutionary intervention in workers' struggles</h4>

<p class="fst">Probably the most important difference among council communists 
concerned revolutionary intervention in workers' struggles. The political 
parties of the 'old' workers' movement had failed.</p>

<p class="fst">When it proved possible to better workers' conditions within the 
confines of capitalism, the once radical labor movement [had] turned into an 
institution providing additional support for the social status quo.<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But did this co-optation of the 'old' movement also mean that the 
very concept of a revolutionary workers' party had become obsolete? Was a 
revolutionary party useful in educating the proletariat for autonomous activity, 
or were all political parties bourgeois organisations that had to be combated?</p>

<p class="fst">In the course of the 1920s, three different positions gradually 
crystallised. First, there were council communists who believed that the 'old' 
workers' movement had only discredited a certain kind of party, but not the idea 
of a party as such. The new revolutionary party should not be something separate 
from the working class, but should dialectically fuse with it. This position was 
defended by, among others, Herman Gorter, who summarised the line of argument 
pithily in three points:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Firstly, regroupment of all workers, of the great majority of 
the proletariat in the [revolutionary] union; secondly, regroupment of the most 
conscious workers in the party; thirdly, unity of union and party."<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">"The advocates of 'unity organisations' had a second position. 
The most important theorist of this intermediate position was Otto Rühle, who 
had already declared in 1920 that 'the revolution is not a party affair [Die 
Revolution ist keine Parteisache]'. In Rühle's eyes, the division of labour 
between party and trade union was a legacy of capitalism. The unity 
organisation, which workers could use to defend their interests an all fronts 
and promote council democracy, should replace them both. The starting point of 
the workers' revolutionary learning processes was where they produced 
surplus-value, that is, in the workplace. There they would have to organise 
their struggle themselves. Through economic struggle, they would educate 
themselves and arrive at a higher, political consciousness. These learning 
processes would find organisational expression in federations of workplace 
organisations, which would carry an economic and political struggle 
simultaneously. This standpoint was virtually identical to revolutionary 
syndicalism."<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The most radical council communists were those who flatly refused 
to intervene in the workers' movement. Anton Pannekoek, while not the 
originator, was the most prominent representative of this standpoint. He lays 
out its logic in his memoirs:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Under the influence of Henk Canne Meijer and others new 
principles gradually became clearer. This one especially: the working masses 
must themselves make the decisions about their struggle, and themselves carry 
out and lead it. This seems either a commonplace or evident nonsense; but it 
means that there is no room for Leaders as such. I remember that I once debated 
with myself during a great strike what the workers should do, and could not 
figure out which of two different attitudes should be taken up; and what if one 
later had to give one's opinion or advice in an article or newspaper? In the 
end, thanks to an article of Henk's, I saw the simple solution all at once: I 
don t have to figure it out; the workers have to figure it out themselves and 
themselves take full responsibility for it."<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The council communists' task, according to this approach, was 
exclusively to study and analyse capitalism and workers' struggles. This 
standpoint, which is still propagated today by Cajo Brendel and a few 
associates, earned its supporters the sobriquet 'cloistered friars of Marxism'.<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a></p>

<h4>iii. Subjective factors</h4>

<p class="fst">The controversies over party building were linked to another 
debate. If, in fact, the 'objective conditions' in the advanced capitalist 
countries are ripe for revolution, what are the 'subjective factors' that keep 
the working class from establishing a new society? Rühle came to the conclusion, 
in roughly 1920 or so, that the deepest cause of the failure of the German 
Revolution of 1918-19 lay, not in the errors of one revolutionary organisation 
or the other, but, rather, in the mentality of the working class. Revolution 
would only be possible in industrialised countries when the working class had 
enough self-confidence and the will to take control of the real loci of power, 
the workplaces, and put them in the hands of unity organisations in which 
political and economic power were united. The fact that the working class had 
not done so in 1918-19 was the result of its subaltern mentality. Rühle wrote in 
1925:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"What is needed most today is the gradual dismantling of 
authority within people themselves, in their mode of psychic activity, in the 
general, daily practice of life in society. Dismantling authority in the 
organizational apparatus is important. Dismantling it in the theory and tactics 
of class struggle is more important. But most important of all is dismantling 
authority in the human soul, because without that it is impossible to abolish 
authority in either organization or tactics and theory."<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a></p>

<p class="fst">While Rühle thus advocated a broad, revolutionary-pedagogical 
approach, most council communists considered that it was not necessary to alter 
the working class's whole psychology, but only to fight against mistaken 
political ideas. Their underlying assumption was that the workers' bourgeois 
ideology kept them from establishing a democracy of councils. As Pannekoek put 
it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"What hampers [the workers] is chiefly the power of the inherited 
and infused ideas, the formidable spiritual power of the middle-class world, 
enveloping their minds into a thick cloud of beliefs and ideologies, dividing 
them, and making them uncertain and confused. The process of enlightenment, of 
clearing up and vanquishing this world of old ideas and ideologies is the 
essential process of building the working-class power, is the progress of 
revolution."<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Marxist philosophy had a central role in explaining and combating 
the 'thick cloud of beliefs and ideologies'. This is why Pannekoek, in 
particular, spent considerable time criticising what he regarded as bourgeois 
thinking inside the workers' movement. In 1938, he published a critique of 
Lenin, especially of Lenin's 1909 book Materialism and Empiriocriticism.<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a> 
Pannekoek tried to prove that Lenin failed in his critique of Ernst Mach and 
Mach's Russian followers Bogdanov and Lunacharsky to go beyond the 
eighteenth-century materialism of the Enlightenment. Lenin reduced 'matter' to 
physical matter, while historical materialism has a much broader concept of 
matter, namely the concept of 'objective reality', or 'the entire observed 
reality', including 'mind and fancies' (Eugen Dietzgen).<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a> Lenin shared his 
tendency towards 'middle-class materialism', in Pannekoek's view, with his 
philosophical mentor Gregorii Plekhanov. Their thinking was in both cases the 
product of 'Russian social conditions':</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In Russia ... the fight against Czarism was analogous to the 
former fight against absolutism in Europe. In Russia too church and religion 
were the strongest supports of the system of government.... The struggle against 
religion was here a prime social necessity ... Thus the proletarian class 
struggle in Russia was at the same time a struggle against Czarist absolutism, 
under the Banner of socialism. So Marxism in Russia ... necessarily assumed 
another character than in Western Europe. It was still the theory of a fighting 
working class; but this class had to fight first and foremost for what in 
Western Europe had been the function of the bourgeoisie, with the intellectuals 
as its associates. So the Russian intellectuals, in adapting this theory to this 
local task, had to find a form of Marxism in which criticism of religion stood 
in the forefront. They found it in an approach to earlier forms of materialism, 
and in the first writings of Marx ..."<a href="#n38" name="fn38" target="_self">[38]</a></p>

<p class="fst">According to Pannekoek, Lenin was waging a battle that had 
already been won in Western Europe. Lenin's ideas were of no use to people 
living under developed capitalism, and would only make the working class's 
self-emancipation more difficult.<a href="#n39" name="fn39" target="_self">[39]</a></p>

<h4>iv. The role of individual actions</h4>

<p class="fst">Another controversy, over the role of individual actions, was 
also linked to the debate on the party. Should conscious council communists 
carry out 'exemplary actions' in order to rouse the proletariat from its 
slumber? Or was that absolutely the wrong thing to do, because it distracted the 
masses from their self-emancipation? This was by no means a purely academic 
question. Council communists with 'activist' leanings tried to act in an 
'exemplary' way several times during the 1920s and 1930s. In the tempestuous 
years of the German Revolution, first the surveyor Max Hölz (1899-1933) and, a 
bit later, the disabled moulder Karl Plättner (1893-1945) formed armed groups, 
which, among other things, robbed banks and plundered country houses in order to 
divide the loot among the poor. They hoped in this way to show the vulnerability 
of existing institutions and inspire other workers to similar deeds.<a href="#n40" name="fn40" target="_self">[40]</a> 
Another council-communist advocate of exemplary action, the disabled Dutch 
construction worker Marinus van der Lubbe (1909-34), became world famous after 
he set fire to the Reichstag in Berlin an 27 February 1933, because, as he later 
told the police, 'I saw that the workers an their own weren't going to do 
anything [against National Socialism]'. Van der Lubbe had been a member in the 
Netherlands of Eduard Sirach's (1895-1937) Left Workers' Opposition, a 
Rotterdam-based council-communist group.<a href="#n41" name="fn41" target="_self">[41]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Council communists' different reactions to Van der Lubbe's act 
demonstrated what the debate on exemplary action was about. Anton Pannekoek (who 
was close to the 'anti-activist' GIC) forcefully criticised Van der Lubbe's 
action and called it 'completely worthless'. Eduard Sirach, by contrast, 
published a pamphlet that ended as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Setting fire to the Reichstag building was the act of a 
proletarian revolutionary... As the smoke rose from this home of democratic 
deception, in which the German masses were sold out to capitalism for fifteen 
years, the illusions in parliamentary democracy that had kept the German workers 
chained to capitalism also went up in smoke. The thirst for action and spirit of 
self-sacrifice that inspired Van der Lubbe must also inspire the working masses 
if they are to put an end to criminal capitalism!! This is why we are in 
solidarity with him!"<a href="#n42" name="fn42" target="_self">[42]</a></p>

<h4>v. The postcapitalist economy</h4>

<p class="fst">Under the Impact of the events in Russia/the Soviet Union, 
various, mainly pro-free-market authors (Ludwig von Mises and others) had argued 
in the years after 1917 that a centrally planned economy was impossible in 
principle. Only a few radical socialists took up the challenge at the time and 
tried to prove the contrary. The most important positive exceptions were 
probably the Austro-Marxist Otto Leichter and Karl Polányi, who was inspired by 
the ideas of 'Guild Socialism'.<a href="#n43" name="fn43" target="_self">[43]</a></p>

<p class="fst">German metalworker Jan Appel (1890-1985), who had represented the 
KAPD at the Second and Third Comintern Congresses and emigrated illegally to the 
Netherlands in 1926, tried to develop a council-communist alternative to 
capitalism. His starting point was that a developed communist society would have 
no market, no competition, no money and no prices. There would thus be only a 
natural economy, in which production and distribution would be regulated 
democratically. Appel countered the criticism of Von Mises and his co-thinkers 
that a rational economy would be unthinkable in such circumstances given the 
lack of an accounting unit (such as value), by proposing socially necessary 
labour time as the basis for such an accounting unit. Appel worked this idea out 
in a manuscript that was discussed and developed further in the Groups of 
International Communists. The result was published in 1930 as a 'collective 
work' under the title Fundamental Principles of Communist Production and 
Distribution.<a href="#n44" name="fn44" target="_self">[44]</a> The text would remain a subject of debate and undergo a 
series of revisions in the following years.<a href="#n45" name="fn45" target="_self">[45]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Fundamental Principles contain a wealth of analyses, tackling 
a wide range of problems of communist economic organisation: the role of small 
and middle peasants, for example, and priorities for deployment of resources in 
different phases of development. But the focus of its analysis is the issue of 
distribution mechanisms. The Principles divide a communist economy into two 
sectors: on the one hand 'productive establishments' that provide goods and 
services for which they receive compensation, and on the other hand 
'establishments for general social use' (GSU establishments), which are not 
compensated for their output. A shoe factory, for example, is a productive 
establishment, a hospital a GSU establishment. Both sectors are made up of 
autonomous units in which the employees have complete freedom of decision. 
'Horizontal co-ordination' among the different units results from the stream of 
products between them (in the form of means of production and consumer goods)<a href="#n46" name="fn46" target="_self">[46]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The principle 'supply according to need' is realised in the GSU 
sector, but not in the other sector. In other words, total consumption by the 
population can be divided into an individual portion (products of the productive 
sector) and a collective portion (products of the GSU sector). In both sectors, 
fixed and circulating means of production (P) are processed with labour (L) in 
order to produce products. All components of the production process contain 
specific quantities of average social production time. Producers are rewarded 
for their efforts with labour certificates, worth for example 'one hour of 
average social production time'.<a href="#n47" name="fn47" target="_self">[47]</a> But not all hours worked are converted 
into labour certificates. An example can make this clearer. Let us suppose that 
all productive establishments as a whole in a given country consume 700 million 
work hours of P and 600 million work hours of L, and produce products worth 
1,300 million work hours. Then, the productive sector needs 700 million work 
hours (P) in order to reproduce itself, leaving 600 million work hours for the 
rest of society. Let us further suppose that the GSU sector consumes 58 million 
hours of P and 50 million work hours of L (with an output of 108 million work 
hours), so that this sector needs 58 million work hours (P) to reproduce itself. 
This means that total input in the form of labour (L) in the society is 650 
million, while 600 - 58 = 542 million work hours is left for individual 
consumption. The so-called 'Remuneration Factor' or 'Factor of Individual 
Consumption' (FIC) is then 542 / 650 = 0.83. If a worker works 40 hours a week, 
she thus receives only labour certificates equivalent to 0.83 x 40 = 33.2 work 
hours.<a href="#n48" name="fn48" target="_self">[48]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As the communist society becomes more highly developed, the 
relative size of the GSU sector increases, so that, eventually, sectors such as 
food supply, transport, housing, etc. are also incorporated into it.<a href="#n49" name="fn49" target="_self">[49]</a> 
Despite this tendency towards growth, however, the GSU sector will never be able 
to include the whole society, and the FIC will thus never be reduced to zero:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Only those productive establishments which supply goods 
satisfying general needs will be amenable for transformation into the GSU type 
of establishment. A little thought will reveal that it will hardly ever be 
possible to include in the System of fully socialised distribution those many 
and varied articles and goods which reflect the special tastes dictated by 
various individual human interests of a specialised kind."<a href="#n50" name="fn50" target="_self">[50]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Principles' core idea seemed to receive powerful support when 
Marx's Grundrisse was published in 1939, including the passage:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Economy of time, to this all economy ultimately reduces 
itself.... Thus, economy of time, along with the planned distribution of labour 
time among the various branches of production, remains the first economic law on 
the basis of communal production. It becomes law, there, to an even higher 
degree. However, this is essentially different from a measurement of exchange 
values (labour or products) by labour time."<a href="#n51" name="fn51" target="_self">[51]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Fundamental Principles played a role in council-communist 
discussions up until the 1970s, but mostly as a background text, since authors 
used ideas from it without mentioning their source.<a href="#n52" name="fn52" target="_self">[52]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>Scholarly research</h3>

<p class="fst">Study of the history, theory and practice of council communism 
has developed in a very uneven way.<a href="#n53" name="fn53" target="_self">[53]</a> Researchers have shown interest above 
all in the writings and biographies of the theorists who played a role in 
council communism. We have at least three monographs an Anton Pannekoek, plus an 
unpublished doctoral thesis<a href="#n54" name="fn54" target="_self">[54]</a> Herman Gorter was the subject of first a 
partial and then a complete biography.<a href="#n55" name="fn55" target="_self">[55]</a> No one has yet written a life of 
Otto Rühle, but three are a few good analyses of his political and theoretical 
development.<a href="#n56" name="fn56" target="_self">[56]</a> Works have also been published an some less prominent council 
communists (such as Sylvia Pankhurst and Jim Dawson). There has still been no 
thorough monograph an Paul Mattick, however.<a href="#n57" name="fn57" target="_self">[57]</a> Several anthologies of 
writings by council-communist theoreticians, particularly by Pannekoek and 
Gorter, but also by Rühle, Mattick and Willi Huhn, have been published since the 
late 1960s.<a href="#n58" name="fn58" target="_self">[58]</a> Pannekoek's extensive memoirs are also available in book form,<a href="#n59" name="fn59" target="_self">[59]</a> while later council communists put their memories down an paper as well or 
were interviewed at length.<a href="#n60" name="fn60" target="_self">[60]</a> Works by Appel, Gorter, Pannekoek and others 
have been republished. A complete edition of Karl Korsch's writings and 
correspondence, necessarily giving considerable attention to his 
council-communist tendencies, has reached an advanced stage.<a href="#n61" name="fn61" target="_self">[61]</a> Good 
bibliographical overviews have been compiled for a number of important council 
communists.<a href="#n62" name="fn62" target="_self">[62]</a></p>

<p class="fst">By now, we are also well provided with works an the narrative 
history of council communism as a movement. The history of the German 
organisations has been studied by Hans Manfred Bock, who not only wrote a 
standard work an the tumultuous events of 1918-23,<a href="#n63" name="fn63" target="_self">[63]</a> but also reconstructed 
the later development of the movement up until the early 1970s.<a href="#n64" name="fn64" target="_self">[64]</a> Philippe 
Bourrinet has described in detail the development of the Dutch movement (and its 
interaction with the German movement).<a href="#n65" name="fn65" target="_self">[65]</a> Mark Shipway has studied 
council-communist influence in Britain (Sylvia Pankhurst, Guy Aldred and 
others).<a href="#n66" name="fn66" target="_self">[66]</a></p>

<p class="fst">While a good deal is thus known by now about council communism, 
there is still a dearth of thorough analyses. Some attention has been paid to 
the council communists' views on capitalist breakdown and the council system, 
but their theoretical contributions merit more serious study.<a href="#n67" name="fn67" target="_self">[67]</a> The 
Fundamental Principles, for example, have so far barely been subject to any 
discussion. Second, historical-materialist analysis of the current is still in 
its infancy. The application of Marxist analysis to Marxism itself, once 
advocated by Karl Korsch, is very much underdeveloped in this respect. Even the 
basic building blocks for an analysis are still lacking. There is, for instance, 
still no good overview of the KAPD's history from its founding to its 
disappearance. On this point, we must be content with fragments.<a href="#n68" name="fn68" target="_self">[68]</a> Virtually 
nothing is known about the practical and organisational functioning of the KAPD, 
its sister organisations and successors. We also know little about its social 
implantation and the sociology of its supporters.<a href="#n69" name="fn69" target="_self">[69]</a> My impression is, for 
example, that the unemployed were very much over-represented among council 
communists of the 1920s and 1930s, but there is still no way to test this 
hypothesis empirically. A comparative historical study explaining why council 
communism became influential chiefly in Germany, while Dutch intellectuals who 
were marginal in their own country acquired such a disproportionate political 
weight in the movement, is equally to be hoped for.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>Results</h3>

<p class="fst">Strict followers of council-communist doctrines are few in number 
today. It is difficult to draw up a balance sheet. Council communism was briefly 
a mass phenomenon in the early 1920s, and really took on its own distinctive 
identity only when the KAPD was already in decline - one could consider it a 
product of the German Revolution's defeat. The rise of National Socialism was 
the coup de gräce for an already much weakened movement. After the Second World 
War, council communism remained a very marginal current among left-wing 
intellectuals for many years, although it acquired some influence in the 
international protest movements of the late 1960s and 1970s.</p>

<p class="fst">Council communism's enduring influence seems to me to be mainly 
indirect. On the one hand, the movement has made a real contribution from a 
non-anarchist perspective to systematic suspicion of all `bureaucrats' in the 
workers' movement. On the other hand, it has shown just as systematically how 
forms of autonomously organised workers' resistance continually manifest 
themselves anew. Its influence was visible, for example, in the Socialisme ou 
Barbarie group of Cornelius Castoriadis, Claude Lefort and others, and even in 
currents that did not have a positive evaluation of council-oriented thinking, 
such as the workerism [operaismo] of Sergio Bologna, Antonio Negri, Karl Heinz 
Roth and others.</p>

<p class="fst">What remain of council communism concretely are mainly texts - 
texts that often seem quite dogmatic and one-sided, with a definite male bias 
and Eurocentric focus. Yet these texts nonetheless contain insights and warnings 
that we should not forget.<a href="#n70" name="fn70" target="_self">[70]</a></p>

The Essen current argued that it was counterrevolutionary to continue demanding 
higher wages. Since capitalism was an its deathbed, economic demands could only 
delay the old society's end. It was time to fight for a complete conquest of 
power, for control over society as a whole. The Berlin current continued, by 
contrast, to stress the importance of wage demands, because workers badly needed 
higher wages in a time of high inflation.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n34" href="#fn34">[34]</a> Rühle 1975, p. 141. Partly due to the influence of his wife 
Alice Gerstel, Rühle saw a logical connection between the pedagogical Marxism he 
propagated and Alfred Adler's Individualpsychologie, in which the quest for 
integral consciousness of the self was also central. Rühle devoted much of the 
rest of his life to developing this idea further. See Kutz 1991 and Schoch 1995. 
Many council communists had little use for Rühle's pedagogical turn. Mattick's 
judgement was: 'This part of Rühle's activity, whether one evaluates it 
positively or negatively, has little, if anything, to do with the problems that 
beset the German proletariat' (Mattick 1978, pp. 110-11).</p>

stages of a Communist society, it may at first be necessary that various 
intellectual occupations be remunerated at a higher level; that, for instance, 
40 hours of labour gives the right to 80 or 120 hours of product.... At the 
beginning of the Communist form of society this could indeed be a just measure, 
if for instance the means of higher education were not available to everyone 
free of charge, because society is not yet sufficiently thoroughly organised an 
the new basis. As soon, however, as there matters have been ordered, then there 
can no longer be any question of giving the intellectual professions a larger
