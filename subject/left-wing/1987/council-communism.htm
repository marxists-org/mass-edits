<p class="fst">Council communism is a theory of working-class struggle and 
revolution which holds that the means that workers will use to fight capitalism, 
overthrow it, and establish and administer communist society, will be the 
workers' councils.</p>

<p class="fst">Historically, workers' councils (or 'soviets', from the Russian 
word for council) first arose in Russia in 1905. During that year, workers in 
many industrial areas engaged in mass strike. In the absence of any widespread 
trade-union organisation, these strikes were organised by committees of 
delegates elected from the factory floor. Where workers of several trades or 
industries were on strike at the same time, delegates from the separate strike 
committees often met in central bodies to unify and coordinate the struggle. The 
most famous example of this was the St Petersburg Soviet, formed in October 
1905. As well as agitating over economic issues, such as limitation of the 
length of the working day, the soviets raised political demands, such as for the 
convocation of Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p class="fst">The events in Russia in 1905 made a considerable impact on 
revolutionaries in Western Europe, and particularly Germany. At this stage, 
however, the soviets were not yet regarded as the most important feature of the 
struggle; Anton Pannekoek, a leading theoretician of council communism whose 
writings will form the basis of this account, recalled later that the soviets 
were 'hardly noticed as a special phenomenon' at the time.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> Instead it was the 
mass strikes of 1905 which made the greatest impression, as typified by Rosa 
Luxemburg's famous account of 1905, which was titled <i>The Mass Strike</i>, and 
which contained only one fleeting reference to the soviets.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">For revolutionaries such as Pannekoek and Luxemburg of the 'left 
wing' of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) the mass strike was one of the 
first signs of the emergency of new forms of organisation and struggle 
corresponding to new developments within capitalism. After the First World War 
this recognition was developed into a theory which saw the working class's use 
of parliament and trade unions as belonging to a period when capitalism was 
still an expanding system and workers were able to win substantial reforms. From 
around the turn of the century onwards, however, as capitalism entered the 
crisis which led to the First World War, it became increasingly difficult for 
workers to wrest any concessions from the ruling class other than through action 
on a mass scale. Furthermore, the end of capitalist expansion also opened up the 
prospect of a revolutionary overthrow of system, and this was again a task to 
which new forms of mass action would be fitted better than the old parliamentary 
and trade-union methods.</p>

<p class="fst">When the workers' councils re-emerged in Russia following the 
February Revolution in 1917 they surpassed the point they reached in 1905, 
setting themselves up as a rival to the authority of the state and then (or so 
it seemed at the time) seizing power themselves in the October Revolution. 'Now 
their importance was grasped by the workers of Western Europe', wrote 
Pannekoek.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> In a pamphlet completed in July 1918, another prominent council 
communist, Herman Gorter, wrote of the soviets in Russia: 'The working class of 
the world has found in these Workers' Councils its organisation and its 
centralisation, its form and its expression, for the revolution and for the 
Socialist society.'<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Under the impact of the Russian Revolution, and the German 
Revolution the following year, various small revolutionary groups which had 
split from the SPD over its support for the First World War formed themselves 
into the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), voting by a majority to adopt 
anti-parliamentary and anti-trade union positions at the founding congress in 
1918. When referring to this period, this anti-parliamentary and 
anti-trade-union majority can for convenience's sake be called 'left 
communists', since at the time their political views appeared to be a 'more 
extreme' version of the 'orthodoxy' by which they were defined, i.e. the 
Bolshevism of Lenin and the Third International.</p>

<p class="fst">Before long, however, the apparently tactical differences between 
the left communists and the Bolsheviks came to a head. During 1919 the left 
communist majority was forced out of the KPD by means of bureaucratic 
manoeuvring, and in April 1920 formed itself into the Communist Workers' Party 
of Germany (KAPD). The KAPD was one of the groups which Lenin attacked in his 
polemic against <i>'Left-Wing' Communism, an Infantile Disorder</i> (1920).<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lenin's criticisms were answered immediately by Herman Gorter in 
a lengthy 'Open Letter to Comrade Lenin', written in the summer of 1920. Gorter 
had already expressed the basic premise of the 'Open Letter' in his 1918 work on <i>
The World Revolution</i>, when he had argued that 'The condition of the Western 
European Revolution, especially in England and Germany, are entirely unlike, and 
cannot be compared with, those of the Russian Revolution.'<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a> Gorter argued that 
in Russia the working class had been able to ally with the peasantry to 
overthrow a weak ruling class. In Western Europe, on the other hand, the working 
class had no natural allies, and faced a very powerful ruling class. Therefore 
all tactics for the class struggle in Western Europe had to aim at increasing 
the power, autonomy and class consciousness of the workers. The tactics 
advocated by Lenin and the Third International - such as participation in 
parliament and in the trade unions, and alliances with Social Democratic Parties 
came nowhere near to fulfilling such criteria. According in Gorter:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"As the Third International does not believe in the fact that in 
Western Europe the proletariat will stand alone, it neglects the mental 
development of this proletariat; which in every respect is deeply entangled in 
the bourgeois ideology as yet; and chooses tactics which leave the slavery and 
subjection to bourgeois ideas unmolested, intact.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Left Wing [by contrast] chooses its tactics in such a way 
that in the first place the mind of the worker is made free."<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">At first, the KAPD, along with like-minded groups from other 
countries, fought for its perspectives within the Third International, believing 
that "Whoever wishes to conduct the West-European revolution according to the 
tactics and by the road of the Russian revolution, is not qualified to conduct 
it."<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> It met with no success in this struggle, however, and left the 
International in 1921 after the Third Congress.</p>

<p class="fst">Soon afterwards, a section of the KAPD (the so-called 'Essen 
tendency') tried to set up a new, Fourth (Communist Workers') International. 
Given the reflux of the post-war revolutionary wave, such a venture was doomed 
to failure, but the Fourth International (or KAI) is still interesting in that 
the attempt to establish it had to be justified by a critique of the Third 
International, the Russian state, and the Russian Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The 'Manifesto of the Fourth Communist International' (written by Gorter in 1921) argued that the Russian Revolution had been a 'dual revolution': 
in the towns, a working-class, communist revolution against capitalism, and, in 
the countryside, a peasant, capitalist revolution against feudalism. This 
contradictory and antagonistic duality had been resolved in favour of 
peasant-capitalist interests in 1921, with the introduction of the New Economic 
Policy. Thenceforth the 'Soviet Government' had ceased to serve working-class 
interests; it had become a capitalist state. Insofar as the Third International 
was tied to the interests of the Russian state, it too lad become a capitalist 
institution. Hence the need for the formation of a new workers' 
International.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">While Gorter was characterising the Russian Revolution as a 'dual 
revolution' - part communist, part capitalist - other left communists went 
further in their critique. In 1921, Pannekoek argued that 'the Russian 
revolution is a bourgeois revolution, like the French one of 1789'.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a> In time 
this view became predominant among the left communists. By 1923 Gorter seemed to 
have abandoned his 'dual revolution' thesis when he argued that 'even in their 
First, revolutionary, so-called communist stage, the Bolsheviks showed their 
bourgeois character'.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> Another left communist, Otto Rühle, had come to the 
conclusion that the Russian Revolution had been a capitalist revolution even 
before Pannekoek or Gorter, and in 1924 he too wrote that the Russian Revolution 
had been 'the last in the line of the great bourgeois revolutions of 
Europe'.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thereafter the term 'left communism' became increasingly 
redundant. What had initially appeared to be disagreements over the tactics of 
the working-class revolution in Russia and Western Europe were now understood as 
fundamental differences between the methods of the <i>capitalist</i> revolution 
in Russia and the <i>communist</i> revolution in Western Europe.</p>

<p class="fst">Revolutionaries such as Gorter, Rühle and Pannekoek analysed the 
Russian Revolution as a 'bourgeois' revolution leading to the establishment of 
state capitalism. For the working class the lasting significance of the Russian 
Revolution did not lie in the type of society to which it had given rise, but in 
the forms of action used by the Russian workers during the revolution:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Russia showed to the European and American workers, confined 
within reformist ideas and practice, first how an industrial working class by 
gigantic mass actions of wild strikes is able to undermine and destroy an 
obsolete state power; and second, how in such actions the strike committees 
develop into workers' councils, organs of fight and of self-management, 
acquiring political tasks and functions."<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus, through their central emphasis on the council form, those 
formerly styled 'left communists' came to be known as 'council communists'.</p>

<p class="fst">At the beginning of the 1920s the KAPD had claimed a membership 
in excess of 40 000. In close alliance were a further 200 000 workers in the 
revolutionary anti-trade-union 'factory organisations' under the umbrella of the 
General Workers' Union of Germany (AAUD). However, as is the case with any 
active communist organisations outside periods of revolutionary turmoil, these 
numbers steadily decreased throughout the 1920s, so that by the 1930s the 
council communists existed only as small, scattered propagandist groups, mainly 
in Germany and Holland. The Dutch Group of International Communists (GIG), 
which was formed in 1927, published the journal <i>Rätekorrespondenz</i> 
('Council Correspondence'). This served as the vehicle for numerous important 
theoretical debates, many of which were taken up by the German revolutionary 
emigrés in the USA who had started publication of <i>International Council 
Correspondence</i> (later known as <i>Living Marxism</i> and then as <i>New 
Essays)</i> in 1934. This was edited by the ex-KAPD member Paul Mattick, and its 
contributors included Rühle, Pannekoek and Karl Korsch. The group in America had 
some contact with the longest-surviving British council communist organisation, 
the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation. The APCF (formed in 1921) published 
a succession of newspapers, the best and last of which was <i>Solidarity</i> 
(1938-44). During the Second World War Anton Pannekoek wrote what is probably 
the best-known expression of council communist ideas, <i>Workers' Councils</i>, 
and he continued to contribute articles to the revolutionary press until his 
death in 1960. In the USA Paul Mattick published a number of books after the 
war, mainly concerned with a Marxist critique of bourgeois economics. His <i>
Anti-Bolshevik Communism</i> (1978) collected together the fruits of a 
life-time's commitment to the revolutionary movement.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>Theoretical Questions</h3>

<p class="fst">In examining the principal theoretical ideas of council 
communism, it is useful to bear in mind that council communism originally 
emerged <i>in opposition</i> to certain dominant trends within the existing 
workers' movement, in particular within Social Democracy and syndicalism. In 
fact, council communist ideas are perhaps most easily understood when approached 
from this angle.</p>

<p class="fst">In one sense, therefore, council communism can be seen as a 
critique of the use of parliament and trade unions as weapons in the class 
struggle. In his early writings, Anton Pannekoek did not reject these outright. 
His text on <i>Tactical Differences Within the Workers' Movement</i> (1909) 
argued that parliamentary debates and propaganda during election campaigns could 
be used to 'enlighten the workers about their class situation'. Trade-union 
organisation could impart a sense of discipline, solidarity, and collective 
class consciousness. Agitation for reforms could also conceivably increase 
workers' class consciousness and organisational strength.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a> However, this 
assessment of the worth of parliament, trade unionism and reformist agitation 
indicates the point of view from which the council communists evaluated all 
forms of struggle, a point of view which Pannekoek summed up in <i>Workers' 
Councils</i>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Here is the criterion for every form of action, for tactics and 
methods of fight, for forms of organisation: do they enhance the power of the 
workers? For the present, but, still more essential, for the future, for the 
supreme goal of annihilating capitalism?"<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As we have seen, in his polemic with Lenin, Herman Gorter had 
argued that all revolutionary tactics had to aim at increasing the power, 
autonomy and class consciousness of the workers. This was a point of view shared 
by Pannekoek, and it was on the basis of such criteria that council communists 
rejected the old methods of Social Democracy. Thus, in 1920 Pannekoek summed up 
his opposition to the use of parliament as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"parliamentary activity is the paradigm of struggles in which 
only the leaders are actively involved and in which the masses themselves play a 
subordinate role. It consists in individual deputies carrying on the main 
battle; this is bound to arouse the illusion among the masses that others can do 
their fighting for them.</p>

<p class="quoteb">... the tactical problem is how we are to eradicate the 
traditional bourgeois mentality which paralyses the strength of the proletarian 
masses; everything which lends new power to the received conceptions is harmful. 
The most tenacious and intractable element in this mentality is dependence upon 
leaders, whom the masses leave to determine general questions and to manage 
their class affairs. <i>Parliamentarianism inevitably tends to inhibit the 
autonomous activity by the masses that is necessary for revolution</i>."<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Before the First World War, Pannekoek had also criticised 
trade-union activity by putting exactly the same emphasis on class consciousness 
and autonomous activity. Within the unions, he argued:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Success or failure appears to depend on the personal qualities 
of the leaders, on their strategic skill, on their ability to read a situation 
correctly; while the enthusiasm and experience of the masses themselves are not 
regarded as active factors."<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">"Success of mass movements depends on their capacity for 
autonomous action, their unquenchable ardour for battle, and the boldness and 
initiative of the masses. But it is precisely these qualities, the primary 
condition of the struggle for freedom that are repressed and annihilated by 
trade union discipline."<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As well as being a critique of parliamentary and trade-unionist 
methods from the point of view of working-class self-emancipation, council 
communism also emerged as an opposition to dominant ideas about what the 
overthrow of capitalism would involve, and how this would come about. In 1938 
Pannekoek wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"There are many who think of the proletarian revolution ... as a 
series of consecutive phases: first, conquest of government and instalment of a 
new government, then expropriation of the capitalist class by law, and then a 
new organisation of the process of production."<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This had been the dominant conception within the Social 
Democratic Second International. Similarly schematic conceptions of revolution 
also prevailed within the syndicalist movement, which looked, for the most part, 
to the gradual building up of industrial unions within capitalism, the overthrow 
of the ruling class by the General Strike, and then the reorganisation of 
society by the unions.</p>

<p class="fst">Council communists rejected these ideas. In <i>Workers' Councils</i> 
Pannekoek wrote that 'victory will not be one event, finishing the fight and 
introducing a then following period of reconstruction',<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a> nor would it involve 
a series of 'different consecutive occurrences'.<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> In Pannekoek's view:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The revolution by which the working class will win mastery and 
freedom, is not a single event of limited duration. It is a process of 
organisation, of self-education, in which the workers gradually, now in 
progressing rise, then in steps and leaps, develop the force to vanquish the 
bourgeoisie, to destroy capitalism, and to build up their new system of 
collective production."<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This idea of revolution as a <i>process</i> is central to council 
communism, and it leads us directly to a consideration of council communist 
ideas concerning class consciousness and organisation, which Pannekoek described 
in 1909 as 'those two pillars of working class power'.<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> In the council 
communists' view, revolution would involve the mass action of a vast majority of 
the working class. This was one of the principal points of divergence between 
the council communists and the Bolsheviks. The communist revolution wrote 
Pannekoek in 1938:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"cannot be attained by an ignorant mass, confident followers of a 
party presenting itself as an expert leadership. It can be attained only if the 
workers themselves, the entire class, understand the conditions, ways and means 
of their fight; when every man knows, from his own judgement, what to do. They 
must, every man of them, act themselves, decide themselves, hence think out and 
know for themselves."<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As this passage illustrates very well, mass <i>action</i> is 
inseparable from mass <i>consciousness</i>, and the council communists 
continually emphasised that widespread class consciousness was one of the 
essential conditions of working-class self-emancipation. This is not to say, 
however, that the council communists thought that widespread class consciousness 
was an essential precondition of revolution, if this is taken to mean that the 
majority of the working class must be fully class conscious <i>before</i> any 
revolutionary action can be attempted. The emphasis in council communism tended 
towards the reverse of such a relationship between class consciousness and class 
action. As Pannekoek put it, the struggles of the workers 'are not so much the 
result as the starting point of their spiritual development'.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> In keeping 
with their idea of revolution as a process, the council communists argued that <i>
generalised</i>, <i>widespread</i> class consciousness could only be a product 
of workers' active engagement in the class struggle itself. In her account of 
the 1905 Russian Revolution, Rosa Luxemburg had argued that the 'high degree of 
political education, of class consciousness and organisation' which the working 
class needed if its struggles were to be successful could not be brought about 
'by pamphlets and leaflets, but only by the living political school, by the 
fight and in the fight, in the continuous course of the revolution'.<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a> 
Luxemburg's conception was shared by the council communists; in 1927 Pannekoek 
argued that class consciousness:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"is not learned from books, or through courses on theory and 
political formation, but through real life practice of the class struggle. It is 
true that prior to action, as well as after action, theory can be expressed in 
concepts that present organized knowledge; but, in order to develop in a real 
sense, this knowledge itself must be acquired in the hard school of experience, 
a harsh lived experience that shapes the mind in the full heat of combat ... It 
is only through the practice of its struggles against capitalism ... that the 
proletariat is transformed into a revolutionary class capable of conquering the 
capitalist system."<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In parallel with their view that widespread class consciousness 
would emerge from active mass involvement in the class struggle, rather than 
from 'simply converting people through propaganda to new political 
opinions',<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a> the council communists also anticipated that working-class 
organisation, the second essential condition of the communist revolution, would 
arise in a similar way. The revolution could not be prepared in advance through 
gradually organising the working class in readiness for the single, decisive 
revolutionary act. In 1912 Anton Pannekoek criticised the attitude which held 
that revolution was 'an event in the future, a political apocalypse, and all we 
have to do meanwhile is prepare for the final show-down by gathering our 
strength and assembling and drilling our troops'.<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a> Against this attitude he 
had put forward the view that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"it is only by the struggle for power itself that the masses can 
be assembled, drilled and formed into an organisation capable of taking 
power."<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a></p>

<p class="fst">He repeated this view in <i>Workers' Councils</i>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The workers' forces are like an army that assembles during the 
battle! They must grow by the fight itself."<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Here Pannekoek's ideas echoed Rosa Luxemburg's formulation of 
the relationship between class struggle and organisation in <i>The Mass Strike</i>: 
'the organisation does not supply the troops for the struggle, but the struggle, 
in an ever growing degree, supplies recruits for the organisation'.<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a> In 1920 
Pannekoek argued that mass revolutionary organisations (such as the 'One Big 
Union' or 'Industrial Unions' that syndicalists sought to create) could not be:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"set up within a still passive workforce in readiness for the 
revolutionary feeling of the workers to function within it in time to come: this 
new form of organisation can itself only be set up in the process of revolution, 
by workers making a revolutionary intervention."<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One example which Pannekoek used in <i>Workers' Councils</i> 
illustrates excellently the council communists' ideas about organisation. In the 
USA in the 1930s the presence of large numbers of unemployed (and therefore 
potential blackleg) workers meant that 'Any regular strike against wage cuttings 
was made impossible, because the shops after being left by the strikers, 
immediately would be flooded by the masses outside.' To overcome this problem, 
workers adopted the <i>occupation</i> tactic, i.e. going on strike, but 
remaining in the workplace. Workers also found that by occupying the workplace 
collectively, the striking workforce was no longer 'dispersed over the streets 
and homes ... separated into loose individuals', and that strikes no longer had to 
be 'accompanied by a continuous fight with the police over the use of streets 
and rooms for meeting'. As Pannekoek pointed out, the occupation tactic, which 
almost as a by-product increased the solidarity and active participation of 
those on strike, was not planned consciously in advance of the actual struggles: 
'It was not invented by theory, it arose spontaneously out of practical needs; 
theory can do no more than afterwards explain its causes and consequences.'<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a> 
Again, there is a continuity here between the ideas of the council communists 
and of Rosa Luxemburg, for in 1904 Luxemburg had argued that 'fighting tactics' 
were not 'invented' by revolutionaries, but were:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"the result of a progressive series of great creative acts in the 
course of the experimenting and often elemental class struggle ... the unconscious 
precedes the conscious, the logic of the objective historical process goes 
before the subjective logic of its spokesmen."<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus organisation and class consciousness are linked through a 
dialectical relationship. New forms of struggle and organisation arise 
spontaneously, in the sense that they are not planned consciously in advance, 
and they arise as a practical response to the problems faced by workers in the 
course of their struggles. Once these new forms have arisen, however, they can 
be made more widely known, and other groups of workers can begin to act on their 
example.</p>

<p class="fst">To sum up these ideas, from the council communist point of view 
the revolutionary process can be seen as one in which the working class 
continually adopts new ideas and new forms of organisation in response to the 
practical problems which confront it in the course of the class struggle. Once 
workers have taken up the fight against the attacks of the ruling class, the 
necessity to overcome the practical problems which crop up in the course of the 
fight pushes workers towards the realisation that existing forms of organisation 
are no longer adequate to their tasks, and that new forms have to be developed. 
In the course of an escalating struggle each practical step forward taken by 
the working class in serious pursuit of its demands leads in the direction of 
the overthrow of the existing system and the simultaneous reorganisation of 
society in the working class's own interests. As Pannekoek put it in 1920:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"without being communist by conviction, the masses are more and more following 
the path which communism shows them, for practical necessity is driving them in 
that direction".<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This is not a unilinear process; advances and retreats follow one 
another. None the less, the underlying tendency is towards communism, if for no 
other reason than that reliance on outmoded ideas and forms of organisation 
invariably leads to defeats, whereas the adoption of new ideas and new forms 
brings successes. In his book, <i>Lenin as Philosopher</i> (1938), Pannekoek 
based this conception on a fundamental 'theory of knowledge':</p>

<p class="quoteb">"On the basis of his experiences man derives generalisations and 
rules, natural laws, on which his expectations are based. They are generally 
correct, as is witnessed by his survival. Sometimes, however, false conclusions 
may be drawn, with failure and destruction in their wake. Life is a continuous 
process of learning, adaptation, development. Practice is the unsparing test of 
the correctness of thinking."<a href="#n38" name="fn38" target="_self">[38]</a></p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>Workers' Councils and Communism</h3>

<p class="fst">This basic account of council communism can be completed with a 
description of the role of the workers' councils within council communist 
theory. As was the case with the council communists' ideas on class 
consciousness and organisation, their emphasis on workers' councils is also 
understood best in the context of the central concept of revolution as a 
process. If revolution is a process, rather than a series of consecutive but 
separate events, then it follows that there must be a single organisational form 
which can be used by the working class throughout all phases of the struggle. In 
a slightly schematic way, it could be said that since communism is based on 
common ownership and democratic control of the means of production and 
distribution, the organisations which carry out the communist revolution must be 
ones which are suited to the realisation of this final goal. As Pannekoek wrote 
in 1938:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Since the revolutionary class fight against the bourgeoisie and 
its organs is inseparable from the seizure of the productive apparatus by the 
workers and its application to production, the same organisation that unites 
the class for its fight also acts as the organisation of the new productive 
process."<a href="#n39" name="fn39" target="_self">[39]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The organisations which the working class uses to fight against 
capitalism are therefore in a sense <i>pre-figurative</i> of the organisations 
which are used for the construction and administration of the new, communist 
society.</p>

<p class="fst">Council communists have commonly expected the workers' councils 
to emerge from mass strike movements where workers would take the conduct of 
their struggle into their own hands rather than leaving it up to existing 
organisations such as the trade unions. All strikers would meet in regular mass 
assemblies to discuss and organise the struggle, and to elect strike committees 
whose members would be delegates mandated by and answerable to the general 
assemblies and who could be recalled and replaced at any time. Where the strike 
centres were geographically dispersed, or as other sections of the working class 
joined the strike movement, delegates from the separate strike committees would 
meet in central bodies to unite and coordinate the struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">To the extent that it began to draw in wider and wider sections 
of the working class, the movement's demands would tend to outstrip their 
original starting-point, and tend towards the expression of the interests of the 
working class as a whole. At the same time, as a consequence of the interests of 
the entire working class being at stake, the general assemblies would be open to 
all those involved in the struggle- revolutionaries, families and relatives of 
strikers, inhabitants of the surrounding communities, the unemployed, and so on.</p>

<p class="fst">Within a fairly short space of time, the general assemblies and 
the local and central strike committees would be faced with tasks other than the 
pursuit of 'economic' demands. For example, they would perhaps have to publish 
bulletins or newspapers, in order to spread information, keep everyone fully 
informed about what was happening, and combat propaganda put out by the ruling 
class. They might also have to form militias in order to defend themselves 
against attacks from the armed forces of the ruling class, and to take the 
struggle onto the offensive. Thus through these and other necessary measures the 
strike committees would take on <i>political</i> functions, becoming in the 
process true workers' councils or soviets, organs of working-class power, 
rivalling the authority of the capitalist state.</p>

<p class="fst">Before long the workers would also be faced with the necessity of 
organising food and power supplies and other essential services, whose normal 
functioning would have been paralysed by the strike movement, in order to supply 
their own material needs. Where factories and workplaces were occupied by 
workers, to all intents and purposes the owning class would have been 
expropriated, and production and distribution would be restarted according to 
the needs of the workers. Here technical, social and political decisions would 
be on the agenda: methods of production, what to produce and in what quantities, 
the basis of distribution in the event of shortages and so on. The workers would 
express their interests in all these matters by exactly the same means they had 
been using throughout the struggle: through their mass assemblies and committees 
of recallable delegates. In other words, 'The workers' councils growing up as 
organs of fight will at the same time be organs of reconstruction.'<a href="#n40" name="fn40" target="_self">[40]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is not hard to see the connections between this brief scenario 
and the theme of 'non-market socialism', for in the situation described above 
all the essential features of a non-market society are present, albeit in the 
most rudimentary, embryonic form: the property of the capitalist minority has 
been expropriated and is now the common possession of the workers; the uses to 
which the means of production shall be put are no longer decided by the 
capitalist minority but are determined by democratic discussion and 
decision-making in which all workers have an equal chance of participation; the 
fruits of production are distributed according to needs expressed by the 
workers, rather than according to capitalist considerations of exchange, profit 
and the market. It would be the birth of a moneyless society based on common 
ownership and democratic control of the world's resources, i.e. non-market 
socialism or communism (both of which terms mean the same thing).</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>Council Communism and Councillism</h3>

<p class="fst">The above sketch of the role of the workers' councils in the 
communist revolution is a suitable starting-point for an assessment of this 
current's strengths and weaknesses. Although the preceding account has been 
couched in speculative, 'would be' terms, this gives a misleading impression of 
council communism; council communists have always rooted their ideas firmly in 
the real experiences and struggles of the working class, and the councils 
themselves have arisen repeatedly in different periods and various circumstances 
during highpoints of the class struggle. Although not always conforming in every 
exact detail to the rough outline sketched above - the councils of the German 
Revolution in 1918, for example, arose from the apparent collapse of state power 
following Germany's defeat in the war, rather than from a mass strike movement - 
on several occasions the actions of the working class have followed the pattern 
described.</p>

<p class="fst">Even outside of the pantheon of 'highpoints' - such as Russia 
1905 and 1917, and Germany 1918 - there have been other times when workers' 
struggles have shown a tendency towards the emergence of the council form, even 
if they have often ultimately failed to realise their potential. The mass 
strikes of July-August 1980 in Poland are a case in point. This massive struggle 
was sparked off by the state's announcement of increases in food prices. The 
Polish workers responded with demands for large wage rises, and since they were 
well aware that the trade unions were a part of the state, they took control of 
their actions themselves, meeting in mass assemblies to elect mandated, 
recallable delegates. Rather than fighting separately, the workers extended and 
centralised their fight. In several regions inter-factory strike committees 
(MKS) were formed, constituted by delegates from scores of different workplaces. 
As well as negotiating with the state, the MKS also set up groups of workers to 
defend occupied shipyards and factories, and organised the supply of food, 
power, and other essential services to a limited extent; in other words, they 
took on some political and social functions beyond the scope of their 
'economic' origins.</p>

<p class="fst">Council communism therefore has the definite merit of being based 
on something which actually exists and which cannot be eradicated, short of 
revolution: the continuing struggle within capitalism between the capitalist and 
working classes. It does not regard revolution as something which occurs on a 
totally different plane from, quite unconnected to, the everyday struggle of the 
workers. It sees communism as a potential lying within the everyday struggle, 
which will emerge from this very struggle. For the council communists, 
therefore, the 'communist movement' is not just the few organised groups of 
workers who are already class conscious; the 'communist movement' is also the 
'movement towards communism', the real underlying tendency of workers' 
struggles within capitalism, which is indeed what gives rise to organised 
groups of revolutionaries in the first place.</p>

<p class="fst">According to council communist theory, the workers' councils are 
revolutionary organisations. They are not <i>permanent</i> mass organisations of 
the working class. They emerge at times of intense political, social or economic 
crisis when workers find themselves compelled to take matters into their own 
hands. Their sole purpose is to negate the authority of one class and install 
the power of another over every aspect of society. If they do not succeed in 
this task, the councils usually disappear with the defeat of the movement which 
produces them; in other words, when their source and lifeblood, the initiative, 
vitality and creativity of the working class, is drained away. Any attempt to 
maintain a permanent existence outside revolutionary periods changes the 
councils' nature: either they take on non-revolutionary functions (for example, 
negotiating with the ruling class 'on behalf of' the workers) or else they turn 
into small propagandist groups defending a political programme.</p>

<p class="fst">The potential for the emergence of workers' councils would thus 
seem to be tied closely to a contingent circumstance: the breakdown of the 
existing political, social or economic 'order'. In 1920 Pannekoek wrote that 
'Economic collapse is the most powerful spur to revolution.'<a href="#n41" name="fn41" target="_self">[41]</a> At that time, 
very few revolutionaries did not sincerely believe (for obvious reasons) that 
capitalism was going through its death throes and would shortly collapse 
virtually of its own accord. Pannekoek himself did not hold this view, but the 
relative importance which he attached to conditions of economic breakdown would 
seem to be accurate. In the concept of revolution as a process, it is the 
workers' pursuit of their demands which almost inexorably leads them to take 
measures which are revolutionary. This may be credible during periods of 
capitalist crisis when it appears as if the working class can only satisfy its 
most basic demands by completely reorganising society. The Polish workers' 
struggle, for example, originated from the working class's protests about its 
inability to obtain one of its most basic material needs &#8211; food &#8211; but this 
original issue was soon outstripped as the struggle began to challenge wider 
and wider aspects of the existing society. However, such deep crises are not a 
permanent feature of capitalism. There are also periods of boom and relative 
prosperity for sections of the working class. During such periods there would 
not appear to be the same potential for the logic of events to lead in a 
revolutionary direction, for the capitalist system has a greater capacity to 
satisfy the material demands which workers place upon it. At such times, the 
conditions which would give rise to a revolutionary struggle and workers' 
councils would appear to be practically non-existent.</p>

<p class="fst">This leads on to the issue of how advocates of the workers' 
councils should organise themselves during periods when the emergence of 
workers' councils and revolution do not appear to be immediate prospects. This 
issue has been a subject of endless debate amongst groups of revolutionaries 
standing within the council communist tradition. Of the 'theorists' of council 
communism mentioned so far, Otto Rühle and Herman Gorter held diametrically 
opposed views on the role of the council communist 'party', while Pannekoek 
occupied an intermediate position.</p>

<p class="fst">Rühle's views on political parties seem to have been shaped 
decisively by the experience of the mass parliamentary parties of the Second 
International. His break with the SPD, which he had once represented in the 
Reichstag, led to an indiscriminate rejection of <i>all</i> political parties. 
In Rühle's view, all political parties were, by definition, 'bourgeois'. In 1924 
he wrote that, 'The concept of a party with a revolutionary character in the 
proletarian sense is nonsense.'<a href="#n42" name="fn42" target="_self">[42]</a> At the end of 1920, Rühle's sympathisers 
dissolved the sections of the KAPD to which they belonged into the local factory 
organisations (part the AAUD). Rühle opposed the separation of economic and 
political organisation, and favoured a single, 'unitary' revolutionary workplace 
organisation. To this end he was influential in the formation of a breakaway 
from the AAUD, called the General Workers' Union of Germany - Unitary 
Organisation (AAUD-E) in 1921.</p>

<p class="fst">The tendency represented by Rühle was opposed vigorously by 
Gorter, who wrote that 'the factory organisation is not sufficient for the great 
majority of the proletariat to become conscious, for it to achieve freedom and 
victory'.<a href="#n43" name="fn43" target="_self">[43]</a> The class situation of workers in individual factories might 
prevent them from having a sufficiently broad over-view of the entire political 
situation. It was therefore vital for the most advanced and lucid revolutionary 
workers to form themselves into a separate communist political party, to act as 
'the one clear and unflinching compass towards communism' and to 'show the 
masses the way in all situations, not only in words, but also in deeds'.<a href="#n44" name="fn44" target="_self">[44]</a> 
This party would not seek to seize power itself; Gorter believed strongly in the 
workers' capacity for self-emancipation, and, indeed, for the reasons he stated 
in his 'Open Letter' to Lenin, argued that there could be no revolution in 
Western Europe otherwise. As more and more workers took up communist ideas, the 
working class, the factory organisations and the party would merge into one 
entity, united on the same level of class consciousness, and capable of 
restructuring society.</p>

<p class="fst">Pannekoek seems to have vacillated between these two positions 
without ever settling on one or the other. This is perhaps not surprising given 
the great length of his period of involvement in revolutionary politics, and the 
changing objective circumstances in which he put forward his ideas. In 1920 
Pannekoek supported a conception of the role of the party similar to Gorter's:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The function of a revolutionary party lies in propagating clear 
understanding in advance, so that throughout the masses there will be elements 
who know what must be done and who are capable of judging the situations for 
themselves. And in the course of the revolution the party has to raise the 
programme, slogans and directives which the spontaneously acting masses 
recognise as correct because they find that they express their own aims in their 
most adequate form and hence achieve greater clarity of purpose; it is thus that 
the party comes to lead the struggle."<a href="#n45" name="fn45" target="_self">[45]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the 1930s, however, Pannekoek swung in the opposite direction, 
echoing Rühle's equation of all political parties with parties like the SPD: 
'The very expression "revolutionary party" is a contradiction in terms.'<a href="#n46" name="fn46" target="_self">[46]</a> At 
this stage Pannekoek defined parties as organisations which sought power for 
themselves; they were therefore incompatible with working-class 
self-emancipation. Revolutionaries with similar ideas might come together to 
discuss and propagandise, and to 'enlighten' the workers through open debate 
with other groups, but these could not be called 'parties' in the 'old' sense of 
power-seeking organisations.<a href="#n47" name="fn47" target="_self">[47]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Later still, in 1947, Pannekoek seemed to return to his original 
position, assigning the same functions to organised groups as he did in the 
1930s, but upgrading their importance in relation to the actions of the working 
class as a whole:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The workers' councils are the organs for practical action and 
fight of the working class; to the parties falls the task of the building up of 
its spiritual power. Their work forms an indispensable part in the 
self-liberation of the working class."<a href="#n48" name="fn48" target="_self">[48]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Council communists have therefore put forward a number of 
different views on the party issue, ranging from Rühle's rejection of all 
parties as inherently 'bourgeois' to Gorter's emphasis on the party's vital role 
as 'the brain of the proletariat, its eye, its steersman'.<a href="#n49" name="fn49" target="_self">[49]</a> In general, 
however, the council communists' chief focus on the workers' own councils has 
assigned the political party to a less central role. The councils are neither 
created nor controlled by any party. They are the spontaneous and independent 
creation of the working class in which all workers participate on equal terms.</p>

<p class="fst">If this emphasis on working-class autonomy and spontaneity is 
taken to an absurd extreme, however, it can lead to two dangers: first, the 
denial of all necessity or reason for any political organisation distinct from 
the majority of the working class, and, second, the fetishisation of any 
organisational form created spontaneously and autonomously by the working 
class. In combination, these dangers amount to what has become known as 
'councillism', i.e. an empty, <i>formalistic</i> emphasis on workers' councils 
which completely neglects the communist <i>content</i> of the council communist 
equation.</p>

<p class="fst">It is certainly safe to say that capitalism could not be 
overthrown, nor could a communist society be brought into being, <i>without</i> 
the self-organised activity of the vast majority of the working class. But this <i>
in itself</i> is not a sufficient condition for the establishment of communism. 
If the class struggle escalated to a situation in which workers began to take 
the organisation of society into their own hands, it would seem reasonable to 
imagine that this would also be accompanied by a corresponding awareness, at the 
level of political consciousness, of the momentous implications of their 
actions. But while this may seem <i>likely</i>, there is sufficient evidence to 
suggest that it is far from <i>inevitable</i>. Although there is rarely any 
absolute separation between form and content in the struggles of the working 
class, neither are there any cast-iron guarantees of the unity of form and 
content.</p>

<p class="fst">It is conceivable that workers could spontaneously take over the 
means of production at a time of political, social or economic crisis, only to 
establish a form of self-managed capitalism. ('Councillists', in fact, see 
nothing wrong in this and have applauded the occasions when this actually 
appears to have happened.) The essential additional condition which must 
accompany widespread working-class self-organisation is, therefore, widespread 
communist consciousness. It is from this fact that the vital need arises for 
council communists to form political organisations of the type described by 
Gorter and the early Pannekoek, agitating and propagandising on the basis of a 
commitment to the goal of a non-market socialist society as the only 
working-class alternative to the existing worldwide capitalist system.</p>

<p class="fst">Council communist intervention in the struggles of the working 
class - participating in, supporting and publicising them, and endeavouring to 
deepen and extend them - should be informed by the perspective of a commitment 
to nothing less than the final goal of communism. This means, if needs be, 
defending the final goal even in opposition to the immediate actions and 
concerns of the working class, as the KAPD clearly understood:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"in the course of the revolution the masses make inevitable 
vacillations. The communist, party, as the organisation of the most conscious 
elements, must itself strive not to succumb to these vacillations, but to put 
them right. Through the clarity and the principled nature of their slogans, the 
unity of words and deeds, their entry into the struggle, the correctness of 
their predictions, they must help the proletariat to quickly and completely 
overcome each vacillation. Through its entire activity the communist party must 
develop the class consciousness of the proletariat, even at the cost of 
being momentarily in opposition to the masses. Only thus will the party, in the 
course of the revolutionary struggle, win the trust of the masses, and 
accomplish a revolutionary education of the widest numbers."<a href="#n50" name="fn50" target="_self">[50]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was argued earlier that there is a dialectical relationship 
between organisation and class consciousness: that new forms of organisation do 
not arise as a result of shrewd forward planning, but once such new forms have 
arisen, their example can be spread and exert a conscious influence on the 
actions of workers in the struggles that take place afterwards. It is as a part 
of this dialectical process, as a link between the real struggles of the working 
class and its understanding of all the implications of these struggles, that 
organised groups of revolutionaries standing in the council communist tradition 
have their most positive and vital role to play.</p>
