<hr>

<p class="fst">The theory of workers' councils originated in the new forms of 
industrial conflict which burgeoned during and immediately after the First World 
War. Among these new forms we can (already) mention wildcat strikes, factory 
occupations and the formation of committees of shop-floor delegates.</p>

<p class="fst">The whole question of the council phenomenon is shrouded in myths 
and mistaken interpretations, which induce caution. For example, while we 
generally tend to associate the soviet with the Russian Revolution, the original 
concept of the council&#8212;based on a radical critique of the classical theory of 
party and unions&#8212;was not formulated in Russia (either in 1905 or in 1917). 
Again, for a long time the councils were presented as an institution springing 
forth spontaneously from the revolutionary mass movement, incarnating the 
autonomy of the masses relative to the proletariat's own organisations. This is 
only completely true in the case of the 1905-7 Russian Revolution, and one 
should bear in mind that the unions were still only in their infancy at the 
time, while the Bolsheviks were unrepresented in the factories. In 1917, on the 
other hand,<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a> the councils were of a very different nature, more closely 
resembling the type then prevalent in Central Europe. Here, reality was a far 
cry from legend. For councils of all kinds were formed on the initiative of one 
or another of the nuances of the socialist movement, or were at least controlled 
by them.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One cannot, therefore, claim that the councils reflected an 
entirely autonomous reality or practice. In any case, this would have been 
inconceivable at a time&#8212;to use a Leninist expression&#8212;when even 
social-democratic consciousness was far from affecting all working-class milieux.</p>

<p class="fst">But as with all genuinely revolutionary epochs, the period 
1914-21 brought with it both topian transformations of reality as well as a 
projection of more profound demands for emancipation which were to remain within 
the realm of utopia.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3]</a> In the world of concrete phenomena one has only to 
think of the immense upheaval which occurred in manners, in the most deeply 
rooted beliefs, in habits and customs unchanged all through the nineteenth 
century. One should also bear in mind the development of new practices, such as 
active State intervention in social and economic life, the growing involvement 
of women of all classes in the world of work, their political as well as 
familial self-assertion; the end of the gold standard and of price stability, 
the assertion of national rights, the collapse of feudal systems (in Eastern and 
Central Europe). These are just some of the factors signalling a total break 
with the past.</p>

<p class="fst">Social relations had inevitably undergone a profound 
transformation. A whole generation had been mobilized, whether in the army, in 
munitions factories, agriculture or hospitals. Uprooted once and for all, it was 
to prove far less submissive, much more turbulent than its predecessors. Above 
all, it was thrust into a world of anxiety and economic uncertainty in which it 
was far more prone to contestation. Nor would the spirit of contestation, of 
revolt even, spare the workers' organizations themselves, for their attitude and 
behaviour in the course of this period was gravely to sap the capital of trust 
they had built up among militants in the pre-war era.</p>

<p class="fst">Paradoxically, the unions and workers' parties actually grew in 
numbers and discipline immediately after the war, at a time when their authority 
was becoming more readily questioned. The haste with which workers' and 
socialist leaders had rallied to their national flags, the collaboration between 
unions and civil and military authorities to break wildcat strikes during the 
war, provided working-class consciousness with a heavy dose of scepticism. So, 
through their new forms of action, workers in fact gave vent to a whole range of 
utopian aspirations made possible by secular subjection. Thus, at one and the 
same time. authoritarian-type apparatuses and ideologies gained in followers 
while losing in credibility. The first leaf of this diptych held sway for half a 
century, with the ascendancy of the workers' leadership becoming <i>topia</i>; 
but today we are witnessing the emergence of a quest for autonomy which was 
already to be found in embryo in the years 1917-21 .</p>

<p class="fst">The institutions which arose in this period, and which constitute 
a positive innovation by comparison with what had by now become a veritable 
working-class custom, partake of this antinomic duality. For the most part, the 
workers' council was under the control of syndicalist or socialist militants. 
But as a <i>project</i> (and the spontaneous and unpredictable conditions of its 
appearance bear witness to this), the workers' council is a concrete utopia, 
overriding and denying the circumstances of its institutionalization. It 
contains, in the form of (not immediately realizable) virtualities, the demand 
for autonomy currently thrusting itself into the forefront of attention.</p>

<p class="fst">The originality of the council movement lay in its perception of 
the drift of future evolution. Although its theoretical work was founded on 
indications only, it was certainly not based on illusion. True, it was difficult 
to avoid triumphalism entirely in the conditions of revolutionary ferment of 
those years. Some even went so far as to identify any workers' council with some 
form of opposition to the established workers' leaderships, thus stumbling into 
a dogmatism which has marked the major part of council ideology. Consequently, 
it is worth taking a look at the real context within which these strikes and 
councils, mutinies and revolts grew up before going on to deal with the theory 
of councils and the circumstances of its birth in detail.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3> The First World War and the emergence of new forms of workers' struggle</h3>

<p class="fst">The situation in most of the belligerent countries was 
pre-revolutionary, if not revolutionary. But setting aside Russia, we find three 
types of situation. In Germany and Austria, councils covered the entire 
territory and assumed at least partial power; in Bavaria and Hungary they 
wielded formal political and social power at the summit: while in England and 
Italy, even if the councils had no political power, they nonetheless developed 
into a far from negligible council movement.</p>

<p class="fst">Workers' councils made their appearance in Austria in November 
1918, at the same time as in Germany. They rapidly spread to cover much of the 
country; but very nearly all of these organizations were formed on the 
initiative of the socialist party, and socialist militants were well represented 
on the councils' highest bodies&#8212;the executive committees. Furthermore, and 
here lies the main difference with Germany, the Austrian councils were never 
once in a position to seize power. The revolution, if revolution there was, 
occurred within the framework of State and parliamentarianism.<a href="#n4" name="fn4" target="_self">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In Germany, on the other hand, the councils were constitutional 
in character. The first occasion was on 10 November 1918, when the Greater 
Berlin Workers' and Soldiers' Council confirmed the composition of the new 
government, which was followed by the transfer of executive power to the 
government on 23 November.<a href="#n5" name="fn5" target="_self">[5]</a> Similarly, a month later the Pan-German Congress 
of Councils handed over its powers to a future Constituent Assembly, for which 
it then voted.</p>

<p class="fst">But reality was more complex than these juridical forms suggest. 
The situation arose out of the balance of political power and of the very nature 
of the workers' councils in Germany. The latter made their appearance in the 
wake of the strike movement and the army mutinies which hit the country as from 
1917. These strikes were aimed at employers who refused to increase wages 
despite rising prices; and at the government, which was doing nothing to halt 
the war, but they were also directed against social democracy and the unions. As 
far back as August 1914 the SPD (the German Social Democratic Party) had adopted 
a policy of collaboration with the imperial government; it was not long before 
the party came to be seen as both a hostage and a guarantee for the government. 
True, the leaders favoured a 'war to the finish'. As for the unions, they had 
undertaken to avoid all industrial conflicts for the duration of the war. And it 
was not an uncommon sight to see the <i>General-kommission</i> (their supreme 
body) making common cause with employers and the military authorities in order 
to smash a work stoppage. As a result, the wave of strikes affecting Germany 
from April 1917 onwards took on a distinctly anti-union colouring; wildcat 
strikes broke out with growing frequency right up until the armistice, only to 
spread with even greater vigour from that moment on.<a href="#n6" name="fn6" target="_self">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">These 'illegal' actions swept the old union structures clean out 
of the factories. In their place workers proceeded to elect delegates who would 
be answerable to the rank and file, and who were hostile to the existing 
hierarchy. The delegates met in works committees (<i>Betriebsräte</i>), 
prefiguring the workers' councils proper, elected on the same basis but for the 
purposes of political representation.<a href="#n7" name="fn7" target="_self">[7]</a> While one can point to the existence 
of councils as early as spring 1917, it was only in the autumn of 1918 that they 
began to spread so widely that, in the eyes of public opinion, they came to 
incarnate the mass revolutionary movement.<a href="#n8" name="fn8" target="_self">[8]</a> It was the naval mutinies which 
sparked off a movement that had been simmering for at least a year; civilians 
were quick on the uptake and, starting with the major ports (Kiel, Hamburg, 
Bremen), each town, each region began electing workers' and soldiers'&#8212;or 
workers' and peasants'&#8212;Councils.</p>

<p class="fst">In the beginning there can be no doubt that these councils arose 
spontaneously, but the situation soon settled down, and by December 
1918-January 1919 it was already possible to take stock of things and to 
distinguish three categories of council, depending upon the size of the 
locality.</p>

<p class="fst">In most small and medium-sized towns the initiative was taken by 
the local SPD organization (generally in collaboration or in agreement with the 
local branch of the unions), either by arranging for the election of a council 
on a show of hands at a mass rally, or by designating the candidates itself. In 
rural areas councils were often formed without socialist participation, and 
bourgeois or agrarian delegates were not infrequent.<a href="#n9" name="fn9" target="_self">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the big towns, notably the industrial ones, the SPD allied 
with the USPD (independent social democratic party, offspring of war-time 
pacifism) in order to control a council or to form it. Where the parties did not 
have the initiative, they arranged to have themselves coopted on to executive 
committees in sufficient numbers, even when the councils were elected by factory 
delegates&#8212;the purest form of workers' democracy. In some large towns, 
however, it was the 'left-wing radicals', the revolutionary wing of social 
democracy, who wielded the predominating influence. But, in general, the SPD was 
in control of the council organizations.<a href="#n10" name="fn10" target="_self">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">From the point of view of the country as a whole, two councils 
assumed particular importance: the Greater Berlin Council and the Pan-German 
Council, constituted on the basis of nationwide elections. Both were led by 
social-democrat majorities. Thus, of the 489 delegates to the Congress of 
Workers' and Soldiers' Councils (16-20 December 1918), 292 belonged to the SPD, 
eighty-four to the USPD, while only ten were Spartakists.</p>

<p class="fst">One may conclude, from this rapid survey, that the spread of 
councils did not in itself express any project going beyond the establishment of 
a democratic republic within the framework of the capitalist regime.<a href="#n11" name="fn11" target="_self">[11]</a> While 
it is true that, from mid-November on, councils began replacing regional and 
local authorities all over Germany, the administration nevertheless stayed at 
its posts and the social power of the landowners and industrialists remained 
intact. It was within the framework of this power system that the change in 
political regime took place; a change sanctioned by the councils, moreover, 
since their national executive handed over the job of drawing up a constitution 
for the German Republic to a parliamentary assembly.</p>

<p class="fst">The fact that the councils were almost entirely dominated by the 
SPD was due to the existing balance of power between the various parties and 
revolutionary groups. But if the councils had no reality <i>outside</i> the 
parties and unions whose representatives populated their executive committees, 
this was due less to the existence of the workers' organizations than to the 
inevitable limitations upon any attempt to transcend social-democratic 
consciousness at the time. Radicality was as yet able to express itself only in 
terms of the <i>project</i> of factory committees and workers' councils.</p>

<p class="fst">One is inclined to wonder whether this was equally true of those 
countries where the councils wielded both political and social power, as was the 
case for a brief period in Bavaria and in Hungary.</p>

<p class="fst">The Bavarian monarchy fell on 7 November, and Kurt Eisner 
proclaimed the republic, which he intended should be organized along democratic 
lines. Five months later he was replaced by a first republic of soviets presided 
over by Ernst Toller, who in turn gave way to a second republic of soviets with 
the communist Eugene Levine at its head. The role of the councils in this 
merry-go-round of regimes was reduced to that of sounding board for the avatars 
of this inter-party struggle. For, here again, real power was in the hands of 
the SPD and the USPD, soon to be joined by the recently formed communist party. 
Thus, both Eisner's provisional government and Levine's council of people's 
commissars resulted from a coalition of parties which held together thanks to 
the lynchpin role played by the independent socialists. Despite the presence of 
anarchists, the councils themselves reflected these partisan cleavages.<a href="#n12" name="fn12" target="_self">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The situation was different in Hungary insofar as the 
socio-economic regime itself was shaken. Nationalization and land redistribution 
measures were planned, even if they did not lead to genuine socialization during 
the 133 days of the Hungarian Soviet Republic (22 March-2 August 1919).</p>

<p class="fst">The significance of the councils in Hungary should be analysed in 
the light of the external situation on the one hand, and of the political forces 
at work on the other. It differs before and after the establishment of the 
Soviet regime.</p>

<p class="fst">The emergence of councils during the war<a href="#n13" name="fn13" target="_self">[13]</a> corresponds to the 
growing radicalization in the belligerent countries. From November 1917 onwards, 
violent strikes and sabotage occurred in the principal factories, and a general 
strike in June 1918 brought the economy to a standstill. These were very bitter 
strikes, whose political character was more pronounced than in other countries. 
Continued pressure from the workers led to increasing radicalization. In January 
1919 several factories were confiscated from their owners and run by the local 
workers' councils.<a href="#n14" name="fn14" target="_self">[14]</a> Despite the existence of an aggressive minority which 
directly attacked the unions, the latter had long been solidly established and 
constituted a vital cog in working-class life. Together with the socialist party 
they controlled the Workers' Soviet of Budapest, the only one to play an 
important political role. Thus it backed Count Karolyi's government, in which 
the socialists were represented. It approved all the measures presented by the 
social-democrat leaders, notably the alliance with the communist group, which 
was demanding the establishment of a council regime.</p>

<p class="fst">In this respect, the establishment of such a regime in Hungary 
looks rather like an operation artificially grafted by the propagandists grouped 
around Bela Kun, who had received some political training during their captivity 
in Russia. Faced with the threat of invasion by the Entente powers, the 
socialists formed a government together with the communist leaders, hauling the 
latter from the gaols into which they had allowed them to be thrown shortly 
before.</p>

<p class="fst">The supreme authority in the new republic was represented by the 
Budapest Council. Following the April 1919 elections, its executive committee 
contained fifty-six socialists and twenty-four communists out of eighty members.<a href="#n15" name="fn15" target="_self">[15]</a>
So the new regime rested, right from the outset, upon a compromise between 
the communists and socialists, the latter deciding in all disputed cases.<a href="#n16" name="fn16" target="_self">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Paradoxically, the reason why the socialists accepted what might 
otherwise look like a very poor bargain, even though they were both stronger and 
better established than the communists, was that they were being attacked from 
the left for their lack of a foreign policy capable of satisfying the 
nationalism of the majority of citizens. The Bolshevik project of creating a 
soviet regime as in Russia was shelved; Bela Kun, the Commissar for Foreign 
Affairs, attempted to extricate Hungary from her tricky position vis-a-vis the 
Entente powers and the territorial claims of her neighbours. Having failed to 
untie this Gordian knot, Kun and his group were obliged to step down, having 
also shown themselves incapable of imposing a 'subjective' solution in a country 
where the 'objective' situation (the importance of rural areas, solid union 
implantation and a very moderate socialist party) was unfavourable to them.</p>

<p class="fst">On the local scene, the old administration continued to exercise 
its authority right through this period; nationally speaking, the councils had 
no existence outside the parties, whose instruments they were.</p>

<p class="fst">While in Hungary, despite its 'soviet' regime, there was no 
council ideology distinct from Bela Kun's bolshevik schema, England experienced 
a genuine movement in favour of free and autonomous workers' expression. This 
movement, known as the 'shop stewards' movement', combined two different 
phenomena.</p>

<p class="fst">On the one hand, before the war, the Socialist Labour Party and 
the Guild Socialists had been spreading propaganda in favour of workers' 
control. This was still only a timid plan to give workers some say in the 
running of their factory, and although both projects stipulated that the workers 
would be represented by their unions, the latter were resolutely opposed to any 
such scheme (as was the majority socialist party, the Labour Party).<a href="#n17" name="fn17" target="_self">[17]</a> But 
the idea was so well received by the metalworkers and miners that the Trades 
Union Congress ended by adopting, in 1918, the principle of joint control in 
those industries whose nationalization it was demanding.</p>

<p class="fst">On the other hand, the wartime period was also a time of great 
agitation, particularly among munitions workers and miners. Most union leaders 
backed the National Government and its war-time policies right up to the hilt!<a href="#n18" name="fn18" target="_self">[18]</a>
Since, on top of this, the unions had undertaken to abstain from all 
strike-backed wage claims, the workers felt obliged to turn to their shop 
stewards (originally little more than union recruiting agents, having no power 
to negotiate) in order to make themselves heard.</p>

<p class="fst">Discontent came to a head in 1915 following two initiatives by 
unions that had subscribed to an 'industrial truce' and had turned a blind eye 
to the practice of 'dilution' (employing semi- or unqualified workers to do 
qualified work) in munitions factories. The Clydeside metalworkers' strike 
(early 1915) confirmed the shop stewards in their new and 'illegal' role; now 
that they were organized into workers' committees they constituted the 
expression of rank-and-file opposition to all authority, whether employers' or 
unions'.</p>

<p class="fst">The Clydeside strike was followed by disputes in other sectors of 
the economy. An uninterrupted succession of work stoppages and violent 
confrontations took place between the outbreak of the great May 1917 strike 
(which had broken out in the munitions industry) and the miners' strike of 1920; 
the shop stewards played a leading role in all these disputes.<a href="#n19" name="fn19" target="_self">[19]</a> Each 
factory, each region set up its own workers' committee, delegates being elected 
on a non-union basis. In most cases, these movements originating in the 
rank-and-file clashed with the existing organizations.<a href="#n20" name="fn20" target="_self">[20]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This phenomenon became very widespread in the first three or four 
years of its existence. Particularly vigorous among the metal-workers, the 
movement expanded after 1918. Regional committee leaders began to set up a 
national structure as early as November 1916, and by August 1917 a conference 
was attended by twenty-three committees. A national council was elected, but the 
committees preserved a good deal of autonomy.</p>

<p class="fst">As for the themes most frequently discussed by the shop stewards' 
movement, we should distinguish between those which are consubstantial so to 
speak, with the movement itself, demanding direct rank-and-file representation, 
the control of industry by the workers themselves and even the negation of the 
capitalist State, and those which were soon to be propagated by the national 
leadership. The latter were more politically marked in character and were to 
popularize slogans originating from the Russian Bolsheviks. As time went on, the 
distance separating the initial impetus and the movement's national council 
widened. While the rank-and-file movement declined following the end of the war, 
most of the delegates and committees being absorbed into the unions, the 
leaders, who now constituted a distinct group, agitated in favour of joining the 
communist party. We have come a long way from the ideological premises of 
1916-19 (worker's control, setting up of factory organizations, negation of the 
State). The slogans had now become: conquest of the State, construction of State 
socialism, construction of a communist party. This evolution was complete by 
1921, when the National Conference of the Shop Stewards' Movement declared that 
the proletariat alone was incapable of managing production without the socialist 
State; the unions were rehabilitated, and political action in the narrow sense 
of the term came to the fore.<a href="#n21" name="fn21" target="_self">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As can be seen, the shop stewards' and rank-and-file movement 
only represented something really radical and innovative in its first years, 
before it came to incarnate a precise political project. Its limitations arose 
out of the circumstances which gave birth to it: the complex problem of 
dilution, which was resolved when the unions returned to their restrictive, 
corporatist attitudes following the end of hostilities. At all events, the 
limits to the radical consciousness of the movement were those of a highly 
stratified working class. It would be another half-century before the 
re-emergence of wildcat strikes and rebellious shop stewards expressing the 
demands for autonomy of a levelled and homogeneous class.</p>

<p class="fst">In Italy, the rising revolutionary wave gave birth to some 
original thinking on the role of councils in the workers' struggle. The post-war 
period especially was marked by disputes between workers and bosses. Strikes 
intensified towards the middle of 1919 (metalworkers in the north, agricultural 
labourers, typesetters, textile workers, sailors).<a href="#n22" name="fn22" target="_self">[22]</a> The economic crisis, 
unemployment, the problems of demobilization, all worked to create an explosive 
situation: anything seemed possible, especially given that the majority of the 
Socialist Party (PSI) was 'maximalist', i.e. revolutionary, refusing to 
participate in any bourgeois government. The first factory occupations occurred 
in March 1919, at Bergamo, where a factory committee took control of production.<a href="#n23" name="fn23" target="_self">[23]</a> By the end of 1919 a network of councils in the Piedmontese metal industry 
involved 150,000 workers. A general strike broke out in Turin in April 1920 
concerning legal time (introduced during the war, and which the employers were 
anxious to suppress). In fact, the strike rapidly turned political, the 
employers proving exceptionally intransigent and refusing to recognize a 
non-union workers' delegation. The movement also met with the resistance of the 
metalworkers' federation, the FIOM, which was hostile to the factory committees. 
With the PSI refusing to call for an extension of the strike to Italy as a 
whole, the dispute ended in a compromise that was far from satisfactory for the 
Turin metalworkers.</p>

<p class="fst">The September 1920 strike, on the other hand, broke out in Milan 
and affected the whole of Italy. Virtually everywhere it was accompanied by 
factory occupations and even workers' control. But this time the strike had been 
called by the FIOM as a tactical weapon aimed at breaking the employers' 
lock-out; it was certainly not a spontaneous and autonomous movement.<a href="#n24" name="fn24" target="_self">[24]</a> This 
strike too ended in capitulation: the promised legislation on 'workers' control' 
never saw the light of day.</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, the phenomenon of rank-and-file organization had 
been stronger and more widespread in Italy than anywhere else. True, the climate 
reigning in the country was explosive, the particularly precocious development 
of fascism being a good indication of the closeness of social revolution. It was 
in the climate of revolutionary fever reigning in Turin early in 1919 that some 
young 'intransigent' socialists, active on the extreme left of the PSI, founded 
a review called <i>Ordine Nuovo</i>. The editorial committee included the future 
leaders of the Italian Communist Party: Togliatti, Tasca, Terracini, Gramsci. It 
is to the last of these that we owe an overall view of the problem of the 
workers' councils. Gramsci draws his inspiration from the modes of workers' 
representation which arose during the war, when it became quite common for 
workers' delegates to be elected for the purpose of maintaining discipline on 
the shop floor. This practice continued after the war, but was not officially 
recognized until February 1919, when 'internal commissions' were set up in order 
to supervise the fair application of the agreement which had just been signed by 
the FIOM and the employers regarding the Piedmontese metal-workers.<a href="#n25" name="fn25" target="_self">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Antonio Gramsci perceived the possibility of turning these 
commissions into workers' councils, i.e. into organizations elected by the 
entire rank-and-file (even non-unionized) and whose competence would not be 
limited solely to questions of wages, working hours and conditions.<a href="#n26" name="fn26" target="_self">[26]</a> He 
dealt with the problem of proletarian institutions since 1918, drawing lessons 
from the Russian Revolution, the English shop stewards' movement as well as from 
the ideas of the American socialist, Daniel De Leon. But his concern for the 
renewal of forms of class struggle is founded upon a preliminary critique of the 
unions which, he wrote, had developed into an unwieldy apparatus living by laws 
of its own, alien to the worker and external to the masses. The unions typified 
a period in which capital was dominant, they had become charged with a function 
inherent in a regime based on private property since they sold the labour force 
under commercial conditions in a competitive market. They were incapable of 
serving as an instrument in the radical renewal of society.<a href="#n27" name="fn27" target="_self">[27]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Gramsci thought that the party too was unsuited to the new forms 
of proletarian struggle: existing in the political arena, it played the same 
role as the unions in the economic sphere, namely that of a competitive 
institution owing its existence to the bourgeois State. Parties and unions were 
no more than the agents (<i>agenti</i>) of the proletariat, to serve as 
instruments of impulsion (<i>propulsione</i>) of the revolutionary process.<a href="#n28" name="fn28" target="_self">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The modern form of struggle, Gramsci continued, was incarnated in 
the workers' councils. Their superiority over other structures stemmed from the 
fact that they assembled workers at their place of work, and in their capacity 
as producers, and not, as was the case with the unions, in their role as 
wage-earners. The councils stood for the negation of industrial legality: their 
'revolutionary spontaneity' implied they were ready to declare class war at any 
moment.<a href="#n29" name="fn29" target="_self">[29]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But the councils were not merely instruments of struggle. In the 
new society they were to take the place of the capitalists and assume all the 
functions of management and administration. Furthermore, their task would also 
be to improve the conditions of production as well as to increase output.<a href="#n30" name="fn30" target="_self">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Although close to the thinking of the German councillists on 
certain points, Gramsci's conception was not without a certain ambiguity. Unlike 
the Germans, Gramsci did not break completely with classical socialism, which 
held that party and unions were invested with the revolutionary task. Thus, 
following the failures of the strikes in April and September 1920, he declared, 
disappointed, that it was the party's task (a regenerated and re-organized 
party, it is true) to give the signal for the revolution, and not that for a 
strikers' rally. One should not exaggerate his criticisms of the party: the 
target for his fury was the historical PSI, but he never questioned the 
superiority of <i>separate</i> political action.<a href="#n31" name="fn31" target="_self">[31]</a> He constantly assigned the 
socialists the task of conquering the majority inside the councils, and this 
majority was to play an active role in the revolution.<a href="#n32" name="fn32" target="_self">[32]</a> Finally, far from 
denying the role of the unions, he recognized that they played a useful function 
of education and preparation for the class struggle.<a href="#n33" name="fn33" target="_self">[33]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Did Gramsci's 'spontaneist' period, in which he even went so far 
as to talk of the proletariat's 'self-liberation', result from his idealization 
of the Russian soviets (about which he was ill-informed).?<a href="#n34" name="fn34" target="_self">[34]</a> Did it come from 
some ephemeral libertarian influence, since militant anarchists had been active 
in the Turin movement?<a href="#n35" name="fn35" target="_self">[35]</a> At all events, from 1921 Gramsci fell in step with 
the Third International's doctrine concerning councils. By April of that year he 
was writing: "The party is the highest form of organization; the unions and 
shop-floor councils are intermediary forms of organization".<a href="#n36" name="fn36" target="_self">[36]</a> Henceforth, he 
proclaimed, the task of "directing the spontaneity of the masses" ought no 
longer to fall upon the councils but upon the party, a powerfully organized and 
centralized, Bolshevik-type party.<a href="#n37" name="fn37" target="_self">[37]</a> Gramsci subsequently became leader of 
the young Italian Communist Party (PCI) and held high office in the Comintern; 
his council period was to be relegated to the bottom drawer of official 
communist history. In any case, his thinking on this subject was too marked with 
ambiguity, the audacity of his critique of the party was too illusory for him to 
be able to tread some marginal path, outside the orthodox communism with which 
he was to finish by identifying completely.</p>

<p class="fst">Despite similar situations of revolutionary ferment in a number 
of belligerent countries, it was only in Germany that a definite break with the 
past was made, and that we find the development of a theory of councils opposed 
to party communism.</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<h3>From left-wing radicalism to left-wing communism</h3>

<p class="fst">Council communism was not born along with councils themselves, 
although the appearance of the latter did precipitate its formulation. As a 
political theory it constitutes the culmination of a long tradition of radical 
opposition within the German social-democratic movement and the unions. The 
conflict with reformist tendencies is as old as socialist workers' organizations 
themselves. If we stick to the period following the 'laws on socialists',<a href="#n38" name="fn38" target="_self">[38]</a> 
we can see that a vigorous left-wing opposition began making itself heard within 
the ranks of the socialist party as early as 1890. Its spokesmen, known as the 
'Young People' (<i>Die Junge</i>), protested against the bureaucratic and 
dictatorial atmosphere almost reigning in the party. The cult of the leader (<i>Führerprinzip</i>), 
they claimed, enabled an all-powerful leadership, paid by the party, to stifle 
any sign of revolutionary spirit and to continue to play the parliamentary game 
for all it was worth. Revolution had now become a slogan regularly repeated 
inside the Reichstag. But then, this purely parliamentary game was well-suited 
to the essentially reformist tastes of the leadership. The 'Young People' were 
excluded from the party at the Erfurt Congress (1891) and went on to found 
independent socialist groups. Such well-known publicists, anarchist militants 
and anarcho-syndicalists as Gustav Landauer and Fritz Kater were to emerge from 
the ranks of these independent socialists.</p>

<p class="fst">A similar battle was then raging within the trade union 
organization. An anti-authoritarian and revolutionary fraction had, since the 
Congress of Halberstadt (1892), been criticizing bitterly the narrow centralism 
and the purely reformist tactics of the leadership. The leadership's opponents 
demanded autonomy for local organizations (hence their nickname: 'the 
localists'), access to strike funds and greater initiative in the launching of 
industrial action for the rank-and-file sections. In 1897 they managed to set up 
an independent fraction where, under the influence of French revolutionary 
syndicalism after 1907, libertarian ideas came to predominate.</p>

<p class="fst">The other oppositional current began to develop in the early 
years of this century. Although it was Marxist, its reading of Marx and Engels 
was far more radical than that of social democratic orthodoxy. <i>Left-Wing 
radicalism</i>, while violently opposed to anarchism, had a number of points in 
common with it, notably its mistrust of party apparatus and its faith in the 
autonomous practices of the masses. Following the elimination of libertarian 
elements from the socialist and union organizations it was this current which 
took up the standard, in anticipation of post-war council communism.</p>

<p class="fst">There were three main currents of thought within the German 
social democratic party at the turn of the century. The revisionist right, 
without always acknowledging its debt to Edward Bernstein, called for a policy 
akin to that of the left-wing bourgeois parties, similar to the French radical 
party or the English Liberals. Then there was the 'Marxist Centre', in control 
of the party, and whose authorized theoretician was Karl Kautsky. Under cover of 
strict doctrinal orthodoxy (contrary to the revisionists, he believed in the 
inevitability of revolution), Kautsky lent his authority to a markedly prudent 
tactic that was scarcely any different from the one Bernstein was calling for. A 
third family of thought emerged during the Russian Revolution of 1905-7. The 
left-wing radicals (<i>Linksradikalen</i>), as they were called, gathered around 
Rosa Luxemburg, whose book <i>The Mass Strike, the Political Party and the Trade 
Union</i> first appeared in 1906.<a href="#n39" name="fn39" target="_self">[39]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Drawing inspiration from her experience of the Russian 
Revolution, Rosa Luxemburg put forward in this book a number of ideas which had 
already been in circulation for some years, notably among the Dutch Tribunists.<a href="#n40" name="fn40" target="_self">[40]</a> She shows that, in European Russia, revolutionary actions&#8212;strikes, 
revolts, street demonstrations&#8212;appeared <i>spontaneously</i>, unprovoked by 
any party. Russian social democracy was insufficiently established among the 
proletariat, with the result that the workers themselves created the 
revolutionary organizations the situation demanded: strike committees factory 
committees, workers' councils. The Radicality of their actions was unfettered by 
the existence of a heavily structured party or of a powerful, but soporific 
union. In Germany, the spontaneity of the workers was stifled by 
bureaucratization of the apparatus, by organization fetishism, the cult of the 
leader. Hundreds of permanent party and union officials went on applying their 
own policy, cut off from the rank-and-file, reluctant to undertake any bold 
initiatives for fear of jeopardizing their magnificent organizational edifice, 
which no longer served any useful purpose. Preservation of the means (the 
organization) now came to take priority over the objective (the revolution).<a href="#n41" name="fn41" target="_self">[41]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In her dispute with Kautsky, Luxemburg held that organization was 
not a static phenomenon but a process: workers provide themselves with the 
organizational forms most appropriate to their struggle. The artificial 
separation of economic and political action is absent from these organizations. 
The party's parliamentarian policies, and the strictly wage-demand-oriented 
policies of the unions, are to be submerged beneath the development of 
spontaneous actions such as mass strikes. Tactically speaking this quarrel took 
on a more concrete character in the years 1908-10, when the party leadership 
ruled out a general strike as a means of fighting for the suppression of the 
plural electoral college in Prussia.</p>

<p class="fst">But although Rosa Luxemburg developed a theory of mass 
spontaneity which permitted her to stigmatize the party's immobilism and its 
congenital reformism, she failed to draw all the organizational and theoretical 
conclusions which flowed from this theory. To the end of her life she remained a 
militant profoundly attached to the party of the masses, to the hierarchy, to 
the congresses and their motions&#8212;in short, to everything which had made up 
the essence of pre-1914 social-democracy.<a href="#n42" name="fn42" target="_self">[42]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Dutch, and Anton Pannekoek in particular, did draw all the 
conclusions, and notably the organizational ones, from their radical critique of 
Kautskyite socialism. Their discussion of the general strike took place rather 
earlier, in 1903, and their attacks on the reformism of the SDAPH (Social 
Democratic Workers' Party of Holland) led them to break away and found a new 
party (the SDP, Social Democratic Party) in 1909. This party never attracted 
more than a few hundred activists and it stayed outside the Second International 
(which didn't want it anyway), but this break did illustrate the extent of the 
divergences between Gorter, Pannekoek and Roland-Holst on the one hand, and 
Troelstra, who was a faithful follower of Kautsky, on the other.<a href="#n43" name="fn43" target="_self">[43]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Tribunists' major criticism of Troelstra and his Dutch 
followers concerned their entirely mechanistic conception of Marxism. While it 
is true that the proletariat's importance derives from its place and its 
function in the productive process, said Pannekoek, one should not imagine that 
the outbreak of revolution is inevitable. Similarly, organization is important 
for the simple reason that it renders the masses strong, disciplined, fusing the 
will of each and everyone into a single will. True, parliamentarianism is a 
powerful means of increasing the cohesion of the working class. And alongside 
this, syndicalism is necessary in order to arouse workers to fight and induce 
them to accept class discipline. But, Pannekoek points out, "socialism will not 
come about merely because all men finally admit its superiority over capitalism 
and its aberrations".<a href="#n44" name="fn44" target="_self">[44]</a> The working class must, in addition, be conscious of 
the necessity of the struggle and of socialism. Pannekoek thought this 
subjective factor was extremely important, while Kautsky ignored it. Class 
consciousness, the former held, is acquired through engagement in mass action, 
led by the workers themselves. Parliamentarianism on the other hand, which was 
the leadership's essential activity, is not the class struggle. Certainly in the 
past it made it possible to unify the proletariat, but it could never lead to 
socialism. As for the unions, they are an institution by now perfectly 
integrated into the capitalist system, since their function is to sell the 
labour force.</p>

<p class="fst">This critique led Pannekoek to relativize the role of the party 
and the unions, without, however, going so far as to examine them from the 
viewpoint of historically situated and dated organizational forms. In his 
quarrel with Kautsky between 1911 and 1913, on the other hand, he denies the 
possibility of transforming the existing State into a socialist State by means 
of an electoral majority, and he declares that the bourgeois State will have to 
be destroyed utterly (<i>vernichtet</i>), its power annihilated (<i>aufgëlost</i>).<a href="#n45" name="fn45" target="_self">[45]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But this revolution cannot be accomplished peacefully; it will 
not be brought about by the present leaders' prudent policies. It will require 
all the might and the will of the proletariat in action. Parliamentarianism and 
union demands are no longer enough. New forms of capitalism (monopolies, 
cartels, the internationalization of production and markets) have given rise to 
new forms of struggle: mass actions. The passive attitude of the 'marxist 
centre' stems from its fear that, by 'ill-considered' initiatives, the masses 
will destroy their patiently constructed organizations. The chiefs, with Kautsky 
at their head, saw their role as that of brake, a check on 'wildcat' 
initiatives. For Pannekoek, this was a singularly restricted conception of 
organization, lingering over its external forms, its visible structures. And 
this at a time when the emergence of an economy based on large units had aroused 
in the proletariat a feeling of common belonging (<i>Zusammengehörigkeit</i>): 
it is this spiritual factor which leads men to organize, to develop structures. 
One may throw over external forms, the subjective element is indestructible.<a href="#n46" name="fn46" target="_self">[46]</a></p>

<p class="fst">On the eve of the war, the Dutch Marxists had thus gone a long 
way towards an organizational and theoretical break with the Second 
International. They had demonstrated the limited character of parliamentary 
struggle (without, however, entirely rejecting it as yet), the capitalist 
essence of unions (whose usefulness they nevertheless continued to underline), 
and had made the destruction of political power the number-one task of the 
revolutionary movement. Finally (together with the Bulgarians and the Russians 
it is true), they had shown it was possible to break with the social-democratic 
movement. But above all, they drew lasting lessons as to the relativity of the 
forms the class struggle was capable of assuming, from the mass movements of 
recent years (1893, 1903, 1905-7, 1903, 1910). It was quite natural, then, that 
they should adopt the new organizational structures which were to emerge during 
and immediately after the First World War.</p>

<p class="fst">The war precipitated the latent tendencies in left-wing 
radicalism. What had started out as a simple critique of orthodox socialism was 
to develop into both a social movement and a revolutionary theory in its own 
right.</p>

<p class="fst">Two kinds of factor worked in favour of this. On the one hand, 
the war had brought to a head German social democracy's desire (but the same 
phenomenon had occurred at the same moment in the other belligerent countries) 
for integration into bourgeois society and even (after November 1918) to 
perpetuate it. This was, in fact, the underlying significance of the 'Sacred 
Union' (<i>Burgfriede</i>, or 'civil peace') wherein the SPD, by its votes in 
favour of war credits, its abstention from any meaningful opposition, implicitly 
approved the German government's war policy. Parallel to this, the unions, by 
deliberately avoiding involvement in industrial disputes, and by even going so 
far as to cooperate with the military authorities in preventing or breaking 
strikes which began to simmer spontaneously in factories throughout the Reich 
from 1916 on, had set themselves up as enemies of the workers. It very soon 
became clear that it would only be possible to carry on the struggle in spite 
of, and against the union leaderships. A whole section of the German proletariat 
thus fell vulnerable to the ideas of the left opposition.<a href="#n47" name="fn47" target="_self">[47]</a> In less than 
three years, this had been transformed from a handful of intellectuals into an 
imposing mass movement. By June 1917 the left opposition accounted for more than 
half the membership of the union organization, and the spring 1917 breakaway 
showed just how far the party itself had been affected.</p>

<p class="fst">Theory too leaped forward, emboldened by the example of the 
Russian Revolution and the appearance of councils inside the Reich itself. The 
constitution of autonomous bodies, both in the factories and in provinces and 
towns, was due to the causes mentioned above. The moment the workers' leaders 
began fulfilling the repressive functions of the employers and the police, each 
movement, each strike became a revolt. Especially since the slightest action 
inside a factory almost automatically resulted in the sacking of union 
officials, cessation of the payment of union dues and the improvisation of 
temporary structures. Thus, even if to begin with a strike was purely concerned 
with, say, a wage claim, it nevertheless developed rapidly into an action in 
which political and economic questions fused to undermine the social <i>status 
quo</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">Left-wing radical theory fed voraciously off these examples of 
mass spontaneity. The organization of councils as the expression of autonomous 
struggle became the fundamental concept of the new radicality.</p>

<p class="fst">Right from the beginning of the war, left-wing militants had 
sought to distinguish themselves from patriotic social democracy. Towards the 
end of 1914 Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, Otto Rühle and Karl Liebknecht 
established a small oppositional circle, the 'Internazionale' group, later to be 
known as the 'Spartakus Group'. Liebknecht broke with party discipline in 
December 1914 by voting against military credits, and he was followed by Rühle 
in the spring of 1915. Their resolute opposition to the war united all left-wing 
radicals, with their hatred of all leaderships (<i>Instanzen</i>), parliamentary 
leaders, paid officials, party propagandists. But divergences soon appeared 
within the ranks of the extreme left. The origins of this split can be traced 
back to the preceding period and to the attitude adopted towards social 
democracy.</p>

<p class="fst">A right wing, for whom the Spartakist leaders acted as spokesmen,<a href="#n48" name="fn48" target="_self">[48]</a> had no wish to break with the party, fearing that by so doing they would 
'cut themselves off from the masses'. Underlying this argument was their 
reluctance to break with the old organizational forms and with the old Second 
International habits, object of so much obloquy in the past.</p>

<p class="fst">This wing linked up with the centrist fraction of the party, the 
'Sozialdemokratische Arbeitsgemeinschaft', in April 1917 in order to found the 
independent social-democratic party (USPD), which took a very moderate line, and 
whose organization scarcely differed from that of the SPD. The other wing was 
more extremist, and followed their ideological premises right through to their 
conclusion. The extreme left-wing radicals were made up of local groups, 
independent of each other, although some of them had already been bastions of 
the opposition before the outbreak of war. This was the case, for example, of 
the Berlin group, gathered around the review <i>Lichtstrahlen</i> (edited by 
Julian Borchardt); the Bremen group, around the <i>Bremer-Burger-Zeitung</i> 
and, subsequently, the <i>Arbeiterpolitik</i> (with Karl Radek, Paul Fröhlich, 
Johann Knief), which was heavily influenced by Pannekoek's thinking; the Hamburg 
group, which edited <i>Kampf</i>, under the direction of Heinrich Laufenberg and 
Fritz Wolfheim. Other extreme left-wing groups were active in Dresden, Frankfurt 
and Brunswick. Unlike the Spartakists, who had not entirely broken with social 
democracy, the extremists were hoping to individualize themselves, 
organizationally speaking. In their view, the task of the future for the 
proletariat was to construct its own organization and conduct its own policy.<a href="#n49" name="fn49" target="_self">[49]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Although they managed to cut all their bridges (and especially 
the financial ones) with the party, the extremists only came together in a 
distinct structure in l920. But as early as autumn 1915 they had labelled 
themselves 'Internationals', after the Bremen and Hamburg delegates had approved 
Lenin's proposal to construct the Third Intemational at the Zimmerwald 
Conference (September 1915), while the Spartakists had preferred to maintain 
their links with the Second Intemational.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus, on the eve of the Russian Revolution, the Internationals<a href="#n50" name="fn50" target="_self">[50]</a> were very clearly moving away from the Spartakists on two points. For one 
thing they were demanding an organization built along different lines from the 
old forms found in their entirety in the USPD. They wanted an organization 
arising out of the struggle itself and action-orientated (<i>Aktionsfähig</i>).<a href="#n51" name="fn51" target="_self">[51]</a> Secondly, in order to mark their complete estrangement from pre-war 
organized socialism, they planned to construct a new International. It was these 
ideas that Pannekoek advocated in the organ of the Zimmerwald Left, which he 
edited with his compatriot, Henrietta Roland-Holst.<a href="#n52" name="fn52" target="_self">[52]</a></p>

<p class="fst">With the October Revolution in Russia, the November 1918 
revolution in Germany and the growth of factory committees and workers' 
councils, the Internationals had at last found a concrete form for the 
organization of their struggle. Soviet Russia illustrated their own notion of 
dictatorship of the proletariat, with power emanating from the base and rising 
towards the town and rural councils.<a href="#n53" name="fn53" target="_self">[53]</a> As a result of their enthusiasm for 
the Russian Revolution they altered their label, and in November the ISD 
(International Socialists of Germany) became the IKD (International Communists 
of Germany), publishing a paper called <i>Der Kommunist</i>, propagating the 
slogan: 'All power to the soviets'.</p>

<p class="fst">Paradoxically, the Russian Revolution brought the Internationals 
and the Spartakists together again; in view of the extent of revolutionary 
turbulence they decided to merge and found the German Communist Party (KPD).<a href="#n54" name="fn54" target="_self">[54]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The constitutive congress took place in Berlin, 30-31 December 
1918, in the midst of great exaltation. But this was not enough to wipe out 
divergences, and the antagonistic currents were to crystallize around three 
questions. What form of organization should dominate in the new party 
(centralization, or decentralization with autonomy for the local sections)? 
Should the new party vote for the Constituent Assembly (and thus participate in 
the parliamentary institutions)? Finally, what should be the party's attitude 
towards the unions (entry into the existing unions in order to stimulate 
opposition from within, or construction of new, even original organizations?).</p>

<p class="fst">The delegates divided into two blocs more or less along the lines 
separating the left and right wings of the old left-wing radicals. A right-wing 
minority (Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht, Karl Radek, Paul Levi) favoured 
electoral participation, entry into the existing unions and a centralized, 
hierarchized organization. Although (through the intermediary of Radek) this 
group had the blessing of the Bolsheviks, it was nevertheless very attached to 
the <i>spirit</i> of social democracy, which it intended to perpetuate in the 
new party. The majority, on the other hand, emerged as the heirs to the boldest 
themes of left-wing radicalism. It contained most of the extremist groups (the 
Bremen, Hamburg, Dresden, etc., Internationals) and the left wing of the 
Spartakists which, for the first time, came out into the open to express its 
disagreement with the respected leaders.<a href="#n55" name="fn55" target="_self">[55]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The confusion between Spartakists (starting with its leaders) and 
the revolutionary wing of the left-wing radicals was deliberately encouraged by 
communist historiography in subsequent years. In reality, however, the 
Spartakists were always rather more cautious than the Internationals, especially 
where tactics were concerned. It was clear right from the inaugural congress 
that the former intended to construct a mass party capable of playing a role in 
the institutional political life of the future Weimar Republic, while the 
latter, the Internationals, were more interested in crystallizing their thirst 
for revolutionary action in some completely new form of organization.</p>

<p class="fst">This unhappy <i>menage à deux</i> was to last until the expulsion 
of the group (the majority group at that!) coming to be known as the left-wing 
communists (<i>Linkskommunisten</i>) at the Heidelberg Congress (October 1919).</p>

<p class="fst">In April 1920 the expelled group founded the KAPD (German 
Workers' Communist Party). Right from the start this new formation boasted 
38,000 members, or rather more than half the KPD, which was left drained of life 
until its merger with the majority of the USPD (in December 1920), the latter 
bringing with it a dowry of some 300,000 militants. The party within which the 
left-wing communists now found themselves was supposed to incarnate the 
principles conceived and propagated since 1915. Its programme (inspired by 
Pannekoek) utterly rejected parliamentarianism and the unions. It sought to 
remain a party of confirmed communists working to develop the revolutionary 
consciousness of the masses and the struggle on the shop floor through 
organizations within the enterprise (<i>Betriebsorganisationen</i>). The new 
party was not organized along federal lines, as some might have hoped, but along 
the lines of 'proletarian centralism', the decisions of the highest bodies being 
binding.<a href="#n56" name="fn56" target="_self">[56]</a> Its refusal to work with the reformist unions led the KAPD to 
assume the programmatic leadership and long-term direction of the new factory 
organizations as well.</p>

<p class="fst">These organizations emerged during the war and their numbers 
increased rapidly after November 1918. They began to unite in the summer of 
1919, notably in the mines and in the metalworking industries. But it was in 
February 1920 (<i>before</i> the creation of the KAPD) that factory committees (<i>Betriebsorganisationen</i>) 
came together to form the General Workers' Union of Germany (AAUD). This 
organization was articulated around the enterprise, the basic cell being formed 
by the factory or workshop; these were then organized at local, provincial (<i>Wirtschaftsbezirk</i>) 
and Reich levels. Its aim was to generate revolutionary agitation within the 
factories with a view to the destruction of capitalism and the establishment of 
a council republic. In 1920 the AAUD had about 100,000 members, but the 
following year membership declined irremediably.</p>

<p class="fst">The decline of council organizations (principally the AAUD, but 
also the anarcho-syndicalist union, the FAU) flowed from the centrifugal 
tendencies, apparent right from their birth, as well as from the political and 
social situation in the country. Factory organizations mushroomed during 1919, 
to the detriment of the unions, which fell back considerably, especially in the 
heavy industries of the Ruhr and central Germany. At first factory committees 
were formed spontaneously, without any precise ideological attachments. It was 
only towards the end of 1919 that ideological divergencies began to surface. 
Firstly because the communist party, under Paul Levi's leadership, was warning 
its militants of the dangers of 'anarchist' tendencies, inviting them to vote 
for the legal factory councils and not to take part in extra-union 
organizations. Secondly because, from December 1919 onwards, the 
anarcho-syndicalists, who had until then shared the views of the left-wing 
communists, now adopted Rudolf Rocker's anarchist- inspired programme, denying 
the necessity of a dictatorship of the proletariat and of the use of violence. 
The new programme returned to the traditional (revolutionary) syndicalist view, 
namely that the trade union, the instrument of economic struggle, was destined 
to become the fundamental organizational unit in the society of the future.</p>

<p class="fst">As opposed to the leaders of the KPD and the FAUD (German Free 
Workers' Union), the council theoreticians were thinking in terms of structures 
suited to both political and economic struggle, constituted at the place of work 
and not at the level of the locality (as in the case of the unions) or the old 
trade unions (the organizational base of the FAUD).</p>

<p class="fst">The emergence of a theory of councils coincides with that of 
factory organizations, though it is impossible to say which came first. At most 
we may presume that the example of the IWW (the American revolutionary 
organization based on industrial unions) was not without influence on the 
thinking of the Hamburg propagandists.<a href="#n57" name="fn57" target="_self">[57]</a> In other words, when the AAUD was 
formed, only some of the factory committees actually joined it; on top of that, 
two tendencies began pulling the organization in opposing directions right from 
the first months of its existence. The Brunswick tendency, close to the left 
wing of the USPD, followed the IWW example, advocating the industry-wide union 
as the basic form of organization. It left the AAUD shortly afterwards and slid 
into obscurity. The other tendency, left-wing, was more deeply prejudicial to 
the cohesion of the <i>Union</i>. This was the so-called 'unitanst' (<i>Einheitsorganisationstendenz</i>) 
tendency which rejected the KAPD's control over the <i>Union</i> and demanded 
instead a unitary organization that would be both politically and economically 
oriented, bypassing political parties. This tendency was especially strong in 
Dresden, the fief of its chief theoretician and spokesman, Otto Rühle, who very 
early (in December 1920) made his section independent of the KAPD. In October 
1921 his organization, the East Saxony section, led a number of other local 
groups out of the KAPD and founded the AAUD-E (German General Workers' League 
Unitary Organization).</p>

<p class="fst">Aside from these centrifugal tendencies, the mass council 
organizations, the Leagues, were further handicapped by the overall situation in 
the country: inflation, growing unemployment, fiercer repression, especially 
since the failure of the March 1921 'action' in the course of which an embryonic 
insurrection was harshly stamped out by the army and the police. After 1921 the 
AAUD began to lose its mass character, evolving into a marginal group. It 
shifted away from the KAPD in 1927 and in 1931, it formed the KAU (Communist 
Workers' Union) together with the remnants of the AAUD-E. As its name suggests, 
the KAU had no pretentions to being a mass workers' movement but consisted of a 
group of propagandists fighting "to make the councils the instrument of class 
will".<a href="#n58" name="fn58" target="_self">[58]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The KAPD suffered a similarly rapid decline after 1921, torn by 
personal and ideological quarrels. The principal disagreements concerned the 
binding nature of the decisions of the highest bodies, relations with the AAUD 
and the question of membership of the Third International. Local groups were 
becoming less and less autonomous, while centralism was gradually gaining the 
upper hand over federalist principles, and the AAUD rapidly became a union 
appendix to a party congratulating itself on having brought together the 
'avant-garde elements'. One final question of practical importance exacerbated 
the party's already considerable difficulties: should militants take part in 
purely economic struggles (<i>Lohnkampf</i>)? The Berlin leadership, dominated 
by Karl Schröder (backed up on doctrinal terrain by the Dutchman Herman Gorter), 
was exhibiting some singularly dictatorial and dogmatic tendencies. In March 
1922 Schröder was outvoted and expelled from the party. So he formed his own 
'Essen Tendency' (<i>Essener Richtung</i>), with its own paper, its own congress 
and its 'own' AAUD. Consequently from 1922 onwards two KAPDs coexisted alongside 
each other, but their numbers were derisory, with 12,000 militants in the Berlin 
tendency at the end of 1922, and only 600 in the Essen wing.<a href="#n59" name="fn59" target="_self">[59]</a></p>

<p class="fst">To begin with, most of the Essen tendency's activities were taken 
up with the establishment of a Fourth International. This attempt in itself 
would only be of passing interest had it not followed immediately upon the heels 
of the KAPD's imbroglio with the Third International, which had caused something 
of a stir within the International and which marked the emergence of a communist 
theory of councils as opposed to the Comintern's party communism.</p>

<h3>Council communism and party communism</h3>

<p class="fst">We have seen that left-wing communism as it emerged in 1918 
follows in the footsteps of the left-wing radicalism of the preceding period. 
The Bolsheviks belonged to this radical opposition in the Second International. 
They even (like the Dutch in 1909) went as far as breaking organizationally with 
Russian social democracy in 1903. Throughout the war, and more especially after 
the October Revolution, the Bolshevik leaders remained very close to the German 
extreme left, especially the Bremen Group. Both Bolsheviks and German 
'Internationals' found themselves in the Zimmerwaldian Left (though not the 
Spartakists, who were opposed to the construction of a new international) 
entrusting Pannekoek and Roland-Holst with editing its official organ, <i>
Vorbote</i>.<a href="#n60" name="fn60" target="_self">[60]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Russian Revolution was enthusiastically welcomed by all 
radical socialists, and especially by the Internationals, who saw in it the 
establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat through the councils.<a href="#n61" name="fn61" target="_self">[61]</a> 
Their enthusiasm was all the greater in that Lenin's recent pamphlet, <i>State 
and Revolution</i> (published in Russia in l918), explicitly adopted the ideas 
Pannekoek had expressed in his dispute with Kautsky over the destruction of the 
bourgeois State and of political power as such. The future left-wing communists 
saw in it a charter for their own revolutionary aspirations; Lenin had 
formulated the classic themes of the <i>Linksradikalen</i>: destruction of the 
State, rejection of elections (and hence of parliamentarianism), the advent of a 
free and equal association of producers.<a href="#n62" name="fn62" target="_self">[62]</a> True, closer reading of the 
pamphlet reveals some rather different propositions. For Lenin stated also that 
there would still be a (transitory) State in the post-revolutionary period, 
exercising an <i>extremely rigorous</i> control and, like all States, 
repressive.<a href="#n63" name="fn63" target="_self">[63]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Divergences only became public in the course of 1919, when the 
left-wing communists (now in the KPD) realized that Moscow, and shortly 
afterwards the Third Intemational, were backing the right wing of the party, in 
other words those elements which favoured the worst deviations of social 
democracy: the cult of organization for organization's sake, parliamentarianism, 
unionism, leader-worship. Following the assassination of its historic leaders 
(Luxemburg, Liebknecht, Jogiches), the 'rightist' Levi took over the party 
leadership (at the end of April 1919) and imposed a policy of 'entryism' into 
the unions, of electoral participation, by way of a stream of decisions without 
appeal and congresses meeting under irregular conditions.<a href="#n64" name="fn64" target="_self">[64]</a> Opponents were 
qualified pell-mell as anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists and, at the 
Heidelberg congress in October 1919, Levi announced that all those who disagreed 
with his views should leave the party, and he actually gained a majority in 
favour of expelling ... the majority! And that at a time when the unions had 
been utterly discredited, when workers' leagues were springing up all over the 
country, when more and more workers were boycotting elections in favour of 
direct action.</p>

<p class="fst">In autumn 1919 the left-wing communists came round to the view 
that Levi was becoming increasingly tempted by social-democratic opportunism and 
that they, the expelled group, were the true representatives of revolutionary 
communism. They consequently formed their own, new communist party, whose place 
they thought was in the Third Intemational. Their desire to join the new 
organization which Moscow had just created resulted from something of a 
misunderstanding. They were convinced Lenin would recognize them as communists 
as soon as he had a moment to talk it out with them and let himself be persuaded 
of the KPD's opportunism.</p>

<p class="fst">Unfortunately for them, the KPD's opportunism only existed 
because it corresponded to the policy of the new intemational, hence to Moscow's 
policy. Right from the KPD's inaugural congress Radek had come out 
wholeheartedly in favour of the right wing, and it was through his auspices that 
Levi took over the party leadership. Lenin himself, in a letter to the left-wing 
communists dated September 1919, had warned against non-participation in 
elections, and against the boycotting of unions and legal factory committees, 
and had described their attitude as 'an infantile disorder'.<a href="#n65" name="fn65" target="_self">[65]</a> He was even 
more incisive in his famous pamphlet on 'left-wing communism' written in spring 
1920 and handed to delegates at the Second Congress of the Communist 
International, abandoning his earlier equivocal stance and explicitly condemning 
the 'Dutch leftists'. He advocated a disciplined, centralized party, taking very 
little notice of the federalist line favoured by the majority of German 
communists. Within the unions, he distinguished between leaders and masses, only 
the former being corrupt; from this he concluded that entry into the unions was 
necessary in order to win over the masses and dislodge the leadership. 
Similarly, he insisted upon the absolute necessity of participation in bourgeois 
parliaments insofar as the masses were still attached to them, and in all other 
bourgeois institutions capable of being entered. The parliamentary game must be 
exploited in all its forms: electoral alliances, compromises, collaboration. 
This policy being justified, in Lenin's view, by the overriding need to raise 
the consciousness of the masses at all costs, and to prepare the way for the 
soviets. The revolution needs a mass party and, in Westem countries, quantity 
must take precedence over quality.<a href="#n66" name="fn66" target="_self">[66]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Despite the ideological gap existing between Moscow and the 
left-wing communists from the outset, the latter waited two whole years before 
giving up hope and leaving the Third International. The KAPD sent three 
successive delegations to Moscow, two in the course of the summer of 1920, and 
one in the autumn. Otto Rühle, who travelled there in May, came back 
disenchanted, talking about the centralized system and the dictatorship of the 
party.<a href="#n67" name="fn67" target="_self">[67]</a> He broke with the KAPD on his return, taking with him the East 
Saxony region. The Party leadership was unconvinced by his report and three of 
the leaders, among them Gorter and Schröder, went to Moscow to see for 
themselves in November 1920.</p>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile, the Second Congress of the Communist International had 
just condemned 'left-wing communism' by refusing to accept the KAPD. The party's 
line on parliament and the unions was judged 'inadequate'. Its programme was 
described as "capitulating to [revolutionary] syndicalist opinion".<a href="#n68" name="fn68" target="_self">[68]</a> 
Furthermore, points 9 and 11 (relating to work inside the unions and in 
parliament) of the twenty-one conditions of admission approved at the same 
congress clearly contradicted the KAPD programme.</p>

<p class="fst">Gorter, who was determined to organize a revolutionary opposition 
inside the Communist International, nevertheless managed to obtain temporary 
admission as a 'sympathizing party', with consultative status.<a href="#n69" name="fn69" target="_self">[69]</a> But Gorter's 
plans came to nothing, and after the Third Communist International Congress 
(summer 1921) the KAPD was ordered to merge with the KPD. It was the end of an 
illusion, and henceforth Gorter and the Essen tendency devoted themselves to 
setting up a Fourth International. This, the KAI (the Communist Workers' 
International), was founded in 1922 and only existed on paper, attracting a few 
hundred militants, mostly German and Dutch.<a href="#n70" name="fn70" target="_self">[70]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Despite these organizational avatars, from the middle of 1920 
onwards, council theory was no longer merely the most extreme expression of 
left-wing radicalism, but had emerged as being diametrically opposed to 
Bolshevik ideology as shared by those communist parties which had subscribed to 
the conditions imposed by the Comintern. From this moment on we can begin to 
speak of a <i>council communism</i>, carrying on the radical tradition of 
Marxism and opposed to <i>party communism</i>, heir to the opportunism of the 
Second Intemational.</p>

<p class="fst">Consequently, council theory originally posed as a virulent 
critique of the very party which was to be known later on as the 'orthodox' or 
'official' communist party, and which eventually became the 'Marxist-Leninist' 
party. In place of unions and parties, council communism proposes natural, i.e. 
historical, groupings of the masses: the councils. Finally, it replaced the 
Russian Revolution in the context of the historical evolution of capitalism by 
looking upon it as a bourgeois revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">Parliamentananism, party and unions, the councillists claimed, 
are forms of struggle adapted to another, pre-revolutionary, age. During this 
historical phase, which ended more or less with the First World War, the 
proletariat was not very numerous and was utterly atomized. It needed an 
organization to defend its immediate interests, leaders to represent it in the 
institutions of the bourgeois State. In that period the unions undeniably played 
a positive role, extracting from the capitalists concessions indispensable to 
the improvement of workers' well-being. Similarly the socialist parties unified 
the class, which thus found itself individualized and represented <i>en bloc</i>.<a href="#n71" name="fn71" target="_self">[71]</a> But, rapidly, as the workers grew in numbers, these organizations external 
to the working class began generating their own bureaucracy, which made itself 
increasingly independent of the masses and tended to defend its own interests. 
As a result, the organizations started to identify with the capitalist system 
and hence to obstruct the revolutionary struggle.<a href="#n72" name="fn72" target="_self">[72]</a></p>

<p class="fst">While the proletariat was naturally reformist in the pre-First 
World War period, in the following phase it aspired to revolution. It was no 
longer concerned with obtaining concessions from employers or the State, but 
with the suppression of both. Given this objective, which is inherent in the 
proletariat, the old organizations and the old tactics (those of the old 
social-democratic movement) had become a brake upon the development of new forms 
of action which are essentially <i>mass actions</i>.<a href="#n73" name="fn73" target="_self">[73]</a></p>

<p class="fst">No doubt, the left-wing radicals had demonstrated the 
short-comings of parliamentarianism at any price before the war, pointing to the 
way it was practised by the socialist chiefs. But they did admit that it had a 
certain utility in the education of the masses and as a propaganda instrument. 
The International Socialists (ISD) themselves continued to express this view 
right up to the eve of the Russian Revolution.<a href="#n74" name="fn74" target="_self">[74]</a> As for the Dutch Marxists, 
they had very early on refused to assimilate the notion of parliamentary 
struggle to that of revolutionary struggle.<a href="#n75" name="fn75" target="_self">[75]</a> But no-one could possibly 
harbour the illusion after social democracy had behaved as capitalism's saviour 
in November 1918 and after. Otto Rühle even went so far as to consider that a 
party was incapable, by definition, of being anything other than a bourgeois 
institution; the term 'revolutionary party' seemed to him to be a nonsense.<a href="#n76" name="fn76" target="_self">[76]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The unions fulfilled the same function of compromise in the 
economic domain as the parties on the political scene. They are merely an 
institution functioning within the framework of bourgeois society and, as the 
war had so strikingly shown, they act as a powerful shield for it. So it would 
be utterly absurd to think of turning the unions into revolutionary instruments. 
As 'organs of capital', the unions aspired to nothing more than recognition by 
the ruling apparatus.<a href="#n77" name="fn77" target="_self">[77]</a> The very development of trade unionism necessarily 
leads it into conflict with the working class, and the revolutionary struggle 
begins the moment workers decide to organize themselves outside union 
structures. The union leaders cling to their positions and to their new social 
status (for their union role has turned these former workers into petit 
bourgeois), summoning up all their strength in order to oppose the revolution 
and communism.<a href="#n78" name="fn78" target="_self">[78]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Third International leadership had imposed the conception of 
a mass communist party on communists in the West. As a result of this they 
everywhere encouraged the unification of revolutionary minorities with the left 
wing of social democracy. Thus, the KPD was transformed overnight from a group 
of a few thousand members into a powerful party with more than 300,000 members. 
The council communists attacked this tactic which, in their view, could only 
bring about a situation where the leaders dominated. For the great majority of 
these newcomers were far from having attained a communist consciousness, and 
this could only mean that they would hand over responsibility to their leaders. 
Under these conditions, the revolution could lead only to a party, but not to a 
class dictatorship. When a class is not yet ready for revolution, no-one can 
carry it through in its place. And when a minority seizes power and holds on to 
it in the name of the proletariat, it is merely following a neo-Blanquist line, 
not communism. It is important to deliver the workers not only from their 
physical and material subjection to the bourgeoisie, but also from their 
spiritual enslavement. But this immense and difficult task cannot be undertaken 
by some resolute avant-garde.<a href="#n79" name="fn79" target="_self">[79]</a> The proletarian revolution will be the work 
of the masses as a whole, and if they allow a party to take power in their place 
then all that will have been achieved is a bourgeois revolution. For the revolt 
against capital is also a revolt against all the old organizational forms.<a href="#n80" name="fn80" target="_self">[80]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This brings us to the heart of council theory. The councils were 
not simply new forms of organization arisen to replace the old. They were also 
the expression of the class locked in struggle.<a href="#n81" name="fn81" target="_self">[81]</a> In this new phase of the 
struggle the proletariat was seeking to destroy the State and wage labour. It 
had come to realize that a revolution does not consist of a change of majority 
in parliament or in the fact of a political party coming to power. New forms of 
production, large economic units, the internationalization of markets and the 
development of monopolies had brought about a transformation of the worker's 
mentality. He now wanted to be master of his own fate and, first and foremost, 
of the basis of all societies: the means of production. But, although the 
working class already possessed the necessary material strength (numbers, but 
also its productive function) to overthrow its masters, it was still too 
impregnated with bourgeois ideology to have a clear conscience about it.<a href="#n82" name="fn82" target="_self">[82]</a> In 
consequence, the proletarian revolution was to take an entire epoch, resulting 
from a slow process of ripening among the masses, from an ever-growing 
consciousness of the tasks awaiting it.</p>

<p class="fst">Obviously, in this new phase of the struggle the proletariat 
cannot hope to rely on its old organizations now allied with capitalism. They 
were suited to a form of struggle in which leaders held sway over passive 
masses; in which revolution was conceived as an operation that had been foreseen 
and planned for in advance&#8212;by the leadership. The proletarian revolution, 
conversely, was to be the fruit of a <i>spontaneous</i> struggle waged by the 
class as a whole. New, more appropriate forms of organization would spring 
forth. But there was no need to invent them, for they already possessed a 
concrete historical existence: the workers' councils.<a href="#n83" name="fn83" target="_self">[83]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Admittedly, the emergence of these councils was not followed by 
the advent of a communist society. The backward economic conditions of Russia in 
1917 had prevented the working class from coming to power. It could have 
happened in Germany in November 1918, if the workers had not been halted in 
their tracks by the conceptions which social democracy had been inculcating in 
them for years. These historical examples at least proved that the time for mass 
action had arrived, that communism would be established by the councils.<a href="#n84" name="fn84" target="_self">[84]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The fact that the councils only had a very limited historical 
existence (in Russia they rapidly became State organs, the docile instruments of 
party domination) leads one to wonder whether the council communists restricted 
their role to the pre-revolutionary period or not. The answers to this question 
are not really very uniform. Most theoreticians, however, attribute a double 
function to them, seeing in them both a revolutionary organrzation and the basis 
of future communist society. That is, they are supposed to act both as a unit 
for struggle and destruction in the revolutionary period. and as wielders of 
economic (above all, the management of production) and political (dictatorship 
of the proletariat) powers in the subsequent phase.<a href="#n85" name="fn85" target="_self">[85]</a> But while all are 
agreed on this, some go on to assign the proletariat the task of forming 
councils right away, while others see councils merely as the organs of a future 
council State.<a href="#n86" name="fn86" target="_self">[86]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As long as we stick to the critique of party communism and to the 
role of councils in the revolutionary process and in communism's transitional 
phase, most members of the council movement are more or less in agreement. 
Differences arise when one tries to answer the age-old question of the <i>
present</i> organization of revolutionaries. The advent of a network of councils 
would signal a very advanced stage of class consciousness: by assuming 
responsibility for the abolition of profit-based society themselves, the workers 
would thereby demonstrate that they had acquired a genuinely communist 
mentality. Until then, those with a clear awareness of the tasks, the 
communists, constituted a minority. Should they organize themselves, should they 
intervene in the workers' struggles to show them the way ahead? Then, if they 
were to come together in a joint organization, what sort of structure should 
this have?</p>

<p class="fst">All these questions gave rise to heated debate in councillist 
circles and continue to divide them to this day. Schematically, we can say that 
the great majority of council communists are opposed to the idea of any external 
group <i>directing</i> the struggle inside factories. Similarly, in principle, 
the council movement is hostile to the party communists' views on centralism, 
discipline and hierarchy. That said, in fact one finds nuances covering all 
colours of the spectrum bounded by two poles, the one tending towards 
organization, the other towards spontaneity.</p>

<p class="fst">At the time when council communism was incarnated in a genuine 
movement, roughly during the 1920s, there was a great temptation to construct a 
councillist <i>party</i>. This tendency was represented by the KAPD leaders, and 
especially their theoretician, Herman Gorter. Gorter (1864-1927) was one of the 
great Dutch poets of the impressionist school. He began to play an active role 
in the SDAP (Dutch Social Democratic Party) from 1896, opposing the revisionist 
tendency. After 1907 he joined the oppositional group which was to found the 
tiny Socialist Party (SDP) in 1909 (with Pannekoek, Van Ravesteyn and Wynkoop). 
In 1918 he took part in the foundation of the Dutch communist party, before 
travelling to Germany, where he joined the left wing of the KPD. From 1920 on he 
became the theoretiaan of both the German KAP (Essen tendency) and its Dutch 
counterpart, which he managed to bring together to form a Communist Workers' 
International (KAI) in 1922.<a href="#n87" name="fn87" target="_self">[87]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In Gorter's view the proletariat needed two kinds of 
organization: those based on the place of work, the factory, and those bringing 
'enlightened' militants together. The former would constitute workers' leagues 
while the others would form the party. The workers' league is a mass 
organization concerned with every-day struggle in the factory. But the drawback 
of the league is its tendency to reformism, confining itself to wage claims. Or, 
conversely, as a result of an erroneous evaluation of the situation, it is 
liable to utopianism. The party, on the other hand, is there to steady the helm: 
it is capable of pointing the way ahead since it is composed of that fraction 
(however minimal) of the working class which possesses the knowledge and a clear 
consciousness of the revolutionary objectives. The Western proletariat needed 
these 'pure' parties, reminders of the one formed by the Bolsheviks in 1902-3. 
But the party must not seek to gain power for its own ends, for the 
revolutionary dictatorship is to be that of the entire class. In any case, 
Gorter prophesied, the proletariat of the industrialized countries of Western 
Europe and North America is far too numerous for a dictatorship of the party to 
be possible. The party of pure communists prefigures the political councils, 
while the unions anticipate the advent of economic councils.<a href="#n88" name="fn88" target="_self">[88]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Gorter's organizational conceptions were not all that different 
from Lenin's own; a party-union duality, with the former taking precedence over 
the latter had after all been set forth in <i>What is to be Done?</i> as early 
as 1902.</p>

<p class="fst">Nor did Otto Rühle (1874-1943) entirely abandon this line, 
except insofar as he advocated a 'unitary' organization. Rühle had been a 
teacher with a deep interest in pedagogic and psychological problems as well as 
a social-democrat deputy in the Reichstag when the war broke out. He followed 
Liebknecht in voting against the war credits in March l915. Right from the 
foundation of the KPD he found himself in the left-wing opposition, which he 
subsequently followed into the KAPD, taking with him his own organization in 
East Saxony (he had been elected President of the Dresden workers' council in 
November 1918). On his return, disappointed, from a trip to Soviet Russia he 
separated his regional group from the KAPD and, in 1921, realized his project of 
creating a unitary organization with the foundation of the AAU-E.<a href="#n89" name="fn89" target="_self">[89]</a> This 
incarnated Rühle's underlying belief that the organization of the revolutionary 
vanguard (which he considered indispensable) should not take the form of a 
political party. It was in the enterprise that the primary battlefield in the 
struggle against the power of capital was to be found, and it was on this basis 
that conscious revolutionaries would seek to unite. The BO (workers' 
organizations) federated and gradually formed the Unitary Workers' League 
(AAU-E). This League took on the characteristics of revolutionary struggle&#8212;economic and political&#8212;and concerned itself with both. It was governed by the 
federalist principle: no centralism, no leadership 'from outside', no 
interference by intellectuals not belonging to the plant. Delegates could be 
revoked at any time, while the leaders were no more than spokesmen for the rank 
and file, its executive organs. The task of unitary organization consisted of 
developing class consciousness and a feeling of solidarity among workers. 
Neither a party nor a union, the AAU-E was the revolutionary organization of the 
proletariat. It dissolved itself with the appearance of the councils which, in 
some ways, it had prefigured.<a href="#n90" name="fn90" target="_self">[90]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The intermediate conception, halfway between the 
'organizationalists' and the 'spontaneists', was developed by Pannekoek, arising 
logically from his views on the nature of the revolutionary struggle, which he 
tied directly to class consciousness. Anton Pannekoek (1873-1960) was an 
astronomer of world-renown and an historian of science; throughout his life he 
pursued a dual career as militant and scientist. He was active in the socialist 
movement for over half a century. He joined the Dutch SDAP in 1912 and, in the 
following year, began developing his theory of mass spontaneity. He was invited 
to Berlin in 1905 in order to teach at the party school, and henceforth he 
became active in both organizations. He became involved in the Bremen left-wing 
radical circles from 1906 onwards, contributing a large number of articles to 
the party journals. He was expelled from Germany in 1914 on account of his Dutch 
nationality, but he carried on his activities in Switzerland and Holland within 
the Zimmerwaldian left while keeping up his contacts with the German 
international socialists. He withdrew from active militant work after 1921 to 
devote himself to astronomy, which he taught at the University of Amsterdam from 
1925 onwards. He nevertheless contributed to the theoretical work of the Dutch 
council communists, the GIC (International Communists Group), and published 
numerous articles in various council-communist reviews in the 1930s and 40s.</p>

<p class="fst">Pannekoek insisted with greater force than his companions upon 
the spiritual aspect of the class struggle. Certainly, he remained a convinced 
Marxist and materialist. But in his view material factors (relations of 
production) had no immediate influence upon the revolutionary process. The 
timelag between the emergence of new material structures or new modes of 
production and the moment the worker's consciousness becomes aware of them and 
adapts to them may be very long. Meanwhile, the worker's consciousness remains 
the prisoner of the beliefs, prejudices and false values of the surrounding 
culture. The power of the bourgeoisie is spiritual before all else: the 
bourgeoisie controls religion, education, propaganda activities and, more 
generally, the entire range of cultural production, to which the worker is more 
or less subjected. There is thus a gap between the material situation as it is 
today, and collective consciousness Hence the need to raise the proletariat's 
consciousness of its emancipatory tasks, while it is growing in numbers and 
while its role in the productive process makes it the true master of this 
process.<a href="#n91" name="fn91" target="_self">[91]</a></p>

<p class="fst">If it is to be carried through to its conclusion, the revolution 
must first exist in the consciousness of the proletariat. The latter will find 
its own road to freedom through its struggles. But at the same time it is vital 
to develop and broaden its consciousness. And this is where the communists, 
those who have reflected and who have mastered the science of historical 
evolution, find their role. These enlightened elements are to meet in small 
groups which Pannekoek saw as being external to the scene of the practical 
struggle, namely the enterprise. Theirs is a function of clarification, 
explanation and discussion. It is their duty constantly to render the task to be 
accomplished ever more clearcut and evident; their task is tirelessly to 
propagate, in their writings and in their speeches. ideas and knowledge, 
formulating objectives, enlightening the masses. Just as the workers' councils 
constitute the units of practical action in the class struggle, these discussion 
groups represent its spiritual force.<a href="#n92" name="fn92" target="_self">[92]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The precise outlines of these groups, which Pannekoek sometimes 
called parties, remain vague. They are without status, nor do they have 
membership cards or regular subscriptions. Most important, it is not their job 
to direct conflicts. It does not really matter to him what they are called so 
long as they are different from what we normally know as parties. These groups 
bring together all those who share the same underlying conceptions in order to 
discuss and to discover the tasks to be accomplished. Their activities are 
purely intellectual, and their importance stems from the fact that victory will 
ultimately depend upon the spiritual force of the proletariat as well.<a href="#n93" name="fn93" target="_self">[93]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Alongside Pannekoek's rather moderate positions (his ideas 
concerning the party consisted of nuances), some council communists' views were 
rather more blunt, rejecting all forms of 'external' organization, no matter 
what its profile might be.</p>

<p class="fst">During the period 1917-23 one encounters conceptions which more 
closely resemble certain anarchist tendencies than the prevailing Marxism. As 
early as 1917, Julian Borchardt, for example, stated that all parties were alike 
and proclaimed the right to autonomy in the face of all authority, even that 
derived from the revolutionary party. Borchardt even rejected the form of the 
party itself, retaining only its 'executive organs' (<i>Ausführende Organe</i>).<a href="#n94" name="fn94" target="_self">[94]</a> A little later a fraction developed inside the 'unitarist' branch of the 
council communists (AAU-E) demanding the dissolution of all general 
organizational structures (i.e. ones bringing together rank-and-file groups).<a href="#n95" name="fn95" target="_self">[95]</a> But these two tendencies stood at the outer edges of council theory. On the 
other hand, a certain number of councillists put forward ideas in the 1930s 
derived by strict interpretation from the very heart of this theory. For these 
people, it was impossible to distinguish between the class struggle and the acts 
of the workers; the workers' movement coincided with the movement of the 
workers. It is governed by its own laws tending toward the appropriation of the 
means of production. Not only does it create its own organs of material struggle 
(factory or action committees) but also its own organs of intellectual 
knowledge: working groups. These groups are no longer gatherings of individuals 
external to the class but constitute an instrument forged by the class itself 
and within its own ranks. This will lead to the autonomous organization of the 
masses into councils, and the autonomous organizaton of <i>revolutionary workers</i> 
into working groups.<a href="#n96" name="fn96" target="_self">[96]</a> In other words, all intervention from outside is 
eliminated; all efforts in the direction of the final objective must come from 
within the class and any exception to this can only be inspired by the 
'ex-workers' movement.</p>

<p class="fst">We have seen how council theory broke away from left-wing 
radicalism, establishing its own individuality <i>against</i> the conceptions 
Moscow was propagating through the Third International. With the passing years, 
the question of the Russian Revolution, its nature and characteristics, was to 
take an increasingly important place in the discussions of these 'working 
groups'. The councillists developed not one but two successive conceptions of 
the Russian Revolution, the content of these conceptions being inseparable from 
their theory as a whole.</p>

<p class="fst">To begin with, from 1919 on, radical theoreticians accepted that 
Russia had undergone a true revolution, abolishing the old regime and carrying 
the proletariat to power. But the specific conditions predominating in this 
backward country meant that the revolution could not be expected to assume the 
same forms as those it would surely take on in the industrialized countries of 
western Europe and North America. For these countries possessed large, educated 
proleletariats, with long histories behind them; they could not rely upon other 
social categories for the completion of their historical task. In Germany, for 
example, the mass of peasants was composed of tenant farmers and smallholders 
whose sole ambition was to enlarge and protect their property: they were the 
natural allies of the industrial bourgeoisie. The proletariat could only count 
on its own forces, material and spiritual. The day it arose, it would take upon 
itself the destruction of the old structures and, above all, it would exercise 
its own dictatorship&#8212;class dictatorship. In Russia, on the other hand, six 
million workers had been backed by a vast mass of peasants also aspiring to the 
expropriation of the capitalists. Once it had achieved power, however, this 
numerically weak working class (in a country of 180 million inhabitants), devoid 
of any tradition of freedom or class consciousness, was obliged to yield power 
to a party made up of conscious and devoted communists whose policy could not 
ignore the social base of its regime: the peasantry. Which explains why the 
dictatorship which was in fact exercised was not one of a class but that of a 
party, a bureaucracy, or more likely that of a few leaders only.<a href="#n97" name="fn97" target="_self">[97]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In spite of this analysis, or perhaps because of it, the council 
communists identified themselves with the Russian Revolution and did not 
question the rightness of Bolshevik theory and practice. Bolshevik tactics were 
considered perfectly appropriate to the situation of an economically backward 
country; all they asked of the CPSU was that it desist from calling for the 
mechanical application of similar tactics to Western Europe, where the situation 
was utterly different.<a href="#n98" name="fn98" target="_self">[98]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Opinions began to evolve from about 1921-2, when the Russian 
Revolution started to emerge as a bourgeois revolution. This change coincided 
with Lenin's introduction of the NEP and his encouragement of private property, 
especially in the countyside. Rühle was one of the first to demythologize the 
'communist' character of the Russian Revolution. On his return from Russia he 
stated that the councils merely masked the dictatorship of the party, and that 
he found no trace of genuine communism; conversely, he went on, there was a 
flourishing new soviet bourgeoisie!<a href="#n99" name="fn99" target="_self">[99]</a> Shortly afterwards all the councillists 
came round to the view that what had occurred in Russia had been a 
democratic-bourgeois or peasant-bourgeois revolution: so far were internal 
policy (the restoration of private property) and external policy (commercial and 
diplomatic relations with the capitalist powers) both supposed to bear witness 
to a process in which power was gradually passing into the hands of a minority 
and which was leading straight towards 'State capitalism'. The tasks facing the 
Russian revolutionaries were those of a defaulting bourgeoisie: the Revolution 
had been made by a handful of representatives of the petit bourgeoisie&#8212;the 
Bolsheviks&#8212;who had then gone on to set themselves up as an obstacle to the 
world proletarian revolution As usual, it was Rühle who stated this idea most 
incisively: for him, the more or less proletarian character of the Russian 
Revolution did nothing to alter its bourgeois essence in a country where the 
first task was to progress from feudalism to the industrial capitalism of the 
modern era. Right from the outset, he claimed, the regime had shown itself to be 
bourgeois: one had only to look to the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the acceptance of 
the principle of the right to self-determination of peoples, the persistence of 
private property among the peasantry or the policy of nationalization, which had 
nothing whatever to do with <i>socialization</i>.<a href="#n100" name="fn100" target="_self">[100]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The essence of this analysis was to remain the same, even after 
the forced collectivization of 1928-30, although refinements were added later. 
Pannekoek later explained that the occupation of power by the party was due to a 
'shortage of cadres' and that the State had substituted itself for the class. 
For him, State capitalism was equally a form of <i>State socialism</i> since the 
State, in Russia, was the sole master. With the bureaucracy carying out tasks 
which, in Western Europe, would have been those of the bourgeoisie, it was 
clearly the job of the bureaucrats to impose industrialization and the 
collectivization of land. This is why, despite its bourgeois character, or 
rather because of it, the Russian Revolution represented an enormous step 
forward, the masses having advanced from a stage of unevolving barbarianism to a 
situation in which they might aspire to dignity. But the price of this progress 
was a heavy one: an oppressive dictatorship, and an even more crushing slavery 
than that weighing upon the working class in Western capitalist societies.<a href="#n101" name="fn101" target="_self">[101]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Second World War led to no notable changes in the council 
theory; a certain number of theses were accentuated, while others were played 
down. The main target of struggles was now the State-unions coalition, as a 
result of which new forms of conflict were to be envisaged, such as wildcat 
strikes and factory occupations. These new methods (not entirely new, since the 
councillists had already observed their appearance before the war) seemed to 
them characteristic of the independence of thought and the autonomy of which the 
proletariat was now capable. The central problem in the post-war revolutionary 
process emerges as the extension of strikes. Since each wildcat strike brought 
the legality of the system itself and property rights into question, the 
repressive function of the union now acted as a spark liable to set the whole of 
society alight. The councillists therefore placed all their hopes in the powers 
of workers' solidarity and in the contagiousness of action which, by degrees, 
would lead the workers to seize the instruments of production. For 
nationalization alone will not do away with exploitation: a new bureaucracy will 
inevitably arise, as in the USSR, to take the place of the old exploiting class. 
The radical solution is the one which leads the workers to control the means of 
production for themselves.<a href="#n102" name="fn102" target="_self">[102]</a></p>

<p class="fst">A few tiny groups propagating council theory or else theories 
close to it survived in the following years in Holland, Australia, Britain and 
France. Since the end of the 1960s, however, the ideas and traditions of council 
communism have suddenly enjoyed a fresh vogue. It has become one of the stars in 
the theoretical firmament of the New Left.<a href="#n103" name="fn103" target="_self">[103]</a> This is why it is necessary to 
situate, or at least to try to do so, the theses of the council movement in 
relation to the aspirations of the new radicality.</p>

<p class="fst">There can be no doubt whatsoever that the council theorists 
remain within the path traced by Marxism: their aim is to supply the one true, 
undeformed interpretation of Marxian thought. Furthermore, their Marxism is very 
narrowly determinist, and in spite of the importance Pannekoek accords to the 
spiritual factor and to consciousness, council communism's interpretation of 
historical materialism remains rather restrictive. The relations of production 
are seen as modifying, with or without timelag, social life and its evolution. 
As Gorter stated, men may make their own history, but only within rather narrow 
limits. Historical evolution is contained within the transformation of the modes 
of production.</p>

<p class="fst">This determinism, rather distant from the spirit of the new 
radicality, all too often gives rise to a certain dogmatism. Councillists 
believe firmly in the crisis of capitalism inevitably resulting in the emergence 
of revolutionay consciousness. Even if they are a good deal less dogmatic than a 
Kautsky or a Lenin, the council communists are nevertheless marked by a strict 
economism.<a href="#n104" name="fn104" target="_self">[104]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The other element equally foreign to contemporary revolutionary 
thought concerns the central place assigned to the enterprise in the process of 
liberation. Pannekoek tells us that production is the very essence of society 
and that enterprises are its constitutive cells.<a href="#n105" name="fn105" target="_self">[105]</a> This statement flows from 
his very imperative historical materialism and his excessive valorization of 
economic factors. This valorization accounts for the councillists' conception of 
work: for them, work was considered desirable, indispensable, the source of all 
spiritual and social life. In other words, their conception of work differed 
barely from the quasi-religious image presented by Marx and Engels. The 
worker-controlled society advocated by the councillists turns out to be an 
immense factory; neither the unpleasantness nor the tedium of work will have 
disappeared. Far from liberating man from productive work, this vision binds him 
to it permanently and irremediably.</p>

<p class="fst">Otto Rühle even went as far as to hold that the worker is only 
really a proletarian when inside his factory. Outside, he is a petit bourgeois, 
philistine in his life-style, dominated by the ideology of the dominant class. 
Only in his place of work does he become a revolutionary.<a href="#n106" name="fn106" target="_self">[106]</a> One ends up 
wondering just how the worker manages to sustain this split personality; can a 
single individual really have twin mentalities, or two faces, like Janus? This 
question leads us to a more fundamental critique expressing the hard core of 
radical theory, namely the very partial character of council communism. For the 
concepts of council communism only really grasp one facet of human alienation, 
ignoring the other aspects, including the everyday life of the individual which 
lies at the heart of the radical critique. It is not certain that the 
proletarian is better armed in the professional struggle than he is in the fight 
against cultural, family and sexual repression.</p>

<p class="fst">Even where the role (ambiguous, to say the least) of 'conscious 
minorities'&#8212;working groups or new-style parties&#8212;is concerned, council 
communism borrows rather too many elements from classical Marxism for it not to 
be a little suspect in the eyes of the new radicals. The councillists were of 
bourgeois origin for the most part, intellectuals who were well-established in 
careers in the surrounding society. There is something paradoxical about their 
enthusiasm for the messianic role of the workers&#8212;the others, to employ the 
existentialist's vocabulary&#8212;when one considers that the autonomy or the 
self-movement of the proletariat lies at the centre of their preoccupations.</p>

<p class="fst">For all this, the councillists did contribute an historical 
contradiction of Leninist ideology. In those dark years when the Third 
International stood out as the incarnation of revolutionary hopes, the 
councillists demystified this claim while starting from the same theoretical 
premises as the official communists.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, by referring first and foremost to the historical 
experience of the councils they gave content and illustration to one of the 
fundamental demands of radicality, namely that the struggle for liberation from 
all constraints should be autonomous. And if they were not alone in placing all 
their hopes and faith in the experience of the councils, they nonetheless 
situated it within the historical evolution of radicality.</p>

ideological unity. Thus, even at the constitutive conference of the USPD (in 
April 1917), the Spartakist representative Fritz Ruck, had expressed views very 
close to those of the Internationals. H. M. Bock, <i>Syndikalismus und

1933). For a long time already, the AAUD-E had been torn between those wanting 
to maintain a solid organization, with decisions taken at the top and binding on 
the rank-and-file (the Rätekommunisten), and those calling for the abolition of 
all constricting organizational structures. As for propaganda, chiefly directed 
against the political parties, it called for the extension of the councils' 
watchword. Cf. <i>Die Allgemeine Arbeiter-Union (Einheitsorganisation). Was sie 
ist und was sie will!</i> (Frankfurt am Main, 1927).</p>

break with social democracy, at least up to December 1918. Cf. her <i><a href="../../../archive/luxemburg/1918/russian-revolution/index.htm">The
