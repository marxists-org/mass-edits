<p class="inline">The question is not what goal is envisaged for the time being by 
this or that member of the proletariat, or even the proletariat as a whole. The 
question is what is the proletariat and what course of action will it be forced 
historically to take in conformity with its own nature &#8211; <b>Marx</b>: The Holy Family</p>

<p class="fst">For much of the twentieth century the theories of a classless 
society, sometimes identified as "Communism" have been associated with either 
the various Police State regimes in under- developed parts of Europe, Asia and 
Africa or with the practice of "Leninist" organizations in the West. Under a 
state sanctioned ideology known as Marxism-Leninism these "Communist" 
governments with varying degrees of success developed capitalism on their soil 
using methods every bit as brutal as any openly capitalist power. On the other 
hand the Leninist parties, in whatever their guise, be it Stalinist, Trotskyist 
or Maoist, functioned either as social democratic organizations (for example in 
Italy and France) or as small irrelevant sects, often aspiring to be social 
democratic organizations. A detailed critique of Leninism from a Council 
Communist perspective would require a much longer article than this one, but it 
ought to be sufficient to note that the course of history has generally run the 
other way from the proponents of the Leninist model.</p>

<p class="fst">For more than half a century 'orthodox' Leninist groups, have 
been trying to build vanguard parties that would 'lead' the working class to 
power. For its part when the working class has moved to challenge capitalism, 
most notably in Hungary in 1956 and Paris in 1968, it has steadfastly ignored 
its would-be leaders. While Leninism figured as a communist orthodoxy since the 
1920's there were currents which also identified with the communist project but 
which sought to place the creative powers of working people at the heart and 
centre of the revolutionary reconstruction of society. Rather than relying on a 
'revolutionary' party they knew it was task of working people, through the 
organizations they would themselves create, to open the gateway to a new and 
better society.</p>

<p class="fst">The theory of council communism, which holds that socialism can 
only be achieved through the active participation of the broad mass of humanity, 
is scarcely known today yet in the early part of this century as a revolutionary 
wave rolled across Europe, it was a significant force. Many of those who would 
be prominent in the 'left' communist circles, as the Council Communists were 
first called, had long histories as dissident and 'ultra left' radicals. Among 
those who would figure in the prominently were such important pre-war radicals 
as Dutch revolutionaries Herman Gorter and Anton Pannekoek, and Germans Otto 
Ruhle and Karl Schroder. Pannekoek is known today largely through two mentions 
in Lenin's writings: A complimentary, although not uncritical reference in State 
&amp; Revolution where Lenin admitted that Pannekoek had been right against Kautsky 
on the question of mass action and revolution, and a second scathing reference 
in Left Wing Communism, where Lenin attacked Pannekoek (identified under his pen 
name of Karl Horner, as an ultra leftist. Yet before the first World War 
Pannekoek's name was better known than any of the Russians and he was to develop 
a deeper and more insightful critique of the Second International than Rosa 
Luxemburg.</p>

<p class="fst">Those who would later develop council communist ideas and 
organizations greeted the Russian Revolution with enthusiasm, as did many 
anarchists who perceived albeit from a distance, in Lenin's writings and 
apparent Bolshevik practice, a similarity of views. By the time of the founding 
of the Communist International in 1919, it was quite clear that there was a 
serious divergence in theory and practice. By the early 1920's many of the left 
communists had begun to regard the Bolshevik regime as a state capitalist 
society, but initially after their separation from the Communist International 
retained formal views on organization. Many organizations, most notable the 
Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD) sought to build new revolutionary 
organizations which would be in the words of Herman Gorter "as hard as steel, as 
clear as glass." As the post war revolutionary wave receded the left communist 
organizations split and fragmented. The KAPD split into separate groupings which 
argued respectively for and against the organization of revolutionaries separate 
from the factory. By the end of the decade the council communists existed only 
in tiny groups, although they continued to have an influence. When the Nazis 
occupied the Netherlands, Pannekoek's name featured prominently on their arrest 
lists.</p>

<p class="fst">Instead of disappearing or concentrating on turning out turgid 
manifestos, the Council Communists began to try and analyze the society in which 
they lived. Part of this analysis involved the question of how capitalism 
maintained control over society and what exactly were the tasks of 
revolutionaries. The Council Communists functioned through small organizations 
sharing a common perspective, but rather than attempting to develop an alternate 
leadership, they sought to clarify and publicize the issues of the class 
struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">In contrast to orthodox Leninist organizations which saw class 
consciousness as something external to the working class and which would have to 
be injected by a bourgeois intelligentsia (hence the doctrine's popularity among 
intellectuals) the Council Communists developed a theory of class consciousness 
which saw working people and their allies moving into struggle as a result of 
actual conditions, not because of the intervention of small groups of 
revolutionaries.</p>

<p class="fst">As Council Communist Paul Mattick put it in 1943:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The consciousness to rebel against and to change society is not 
developed by the 'propaganda' of conscious minorities, but by the real and 
direct propaganda of events ... So long as minorities operate within the mass, 
the mass is not revolutionary, but neither is the minority. Its 'revolutionary 
conceptions' can still only serve capitalistic functions. If the masses become 
revolutionary, the distinction between conscious minority and unconscious 
majority disappears, and also the capitalistic function of the apparently 
'revolutionary' minority." &#8211; <b>Mattick</b>: From the Bottom Up</p>

<p class="fst">At times when the masses were not in motion, the propaganda of 
small groups was ineffective and worthless. In this way the actual practice of 
Leninist and council communist groups was little different except that the 
Leninist groups saw themselves as something different and intervened into 
struggles to try to win the masses to their programme. In contrast to Trotsky, 
who when he wrote in 1938 that "the crisis of humanity is the crisis of 
leadership" was referring to his own organization the Fourth International, the 
Council Communist groups realized that the building of socialism did not depend 
upon the building of their organization. Pannekoek was to argue in the 1940's 
that there was an internal contradiction in the term "revolutionary party." 
While the "vanguard party" sought power, the duty of the revolutionary 
socialists was to try and aid the the political and economic development of the 
working class. The Council Communists expected this development to take place 
through an escalating series of class actions leading to the establishment of 
workers' councils. Nevertheless they realized that this expectation could not be 
a dogma imposed regardless of situation, but the key aspect of their analysis 
remained the theme of workers' self emancipation.</p>

<p class="fst">The Council Communists saw trade unions as a part of the 
capitalist methods of control. Trade unions are bargaining agents for the sale 
of labour power. As such they are a part of the capitalist system, but they are 
also responsible for getting a better price for labour power. If this were not 
true, no one would join them. The Council Communists simply recognized this fact 
and insisted that demands to make the unions "fight" or to leave the unions to 
set up 'red' unions was fruitless. Workers would remain in unions as long as saw 
them as necessary. When they were no longer necessary or did not serve the 
workers' needs they would be cast off. In the 1930's and beyond the wildcat 
strike was seen as a herald of this kind of development For the same reason 
appeals for and against parliament were also deemed worthless. In contrast to 
those who argue to vote for social democratic parties like the New Democratic 
Party, but to fight for a socialist alternative, or to build socialist caucuses 
in the party, workers vote and do not vote for the NDP to the extent that they 
perceive the party as corresponding to their interests. Those who abstained from 
voting in parliamentary elections did so because they saw no reason to 
participate; however those who maintained parliamentary illusions, could just as 
easily participate in wildcat strikes and militant actions when they saw it as 
necessary.</p>

<p class="fst">For much of the so-called revolutionary left there is indeed a 
crisis in the workers' movement. Their organizations are small and without roots 
in the class many of their militants genuinely wish to liberate. This situation 
appears unlikely to change in the near future. Yet class struggle continues to 
take place on both a global and a local scale. For those organization which are 
influenced by council communist ideas the future is not so bleak. The fate of 
these organizations and journals rests upon the evolution of the class struggle, 
not on their ability to develop to "win the masses to their banner." It would be 
foolish to simply imagine that the ideas and theories developed by the Council 
Communists half a century ago can be mechanically applied to the world of today; 
perhaps even as foolish as trying to apply the ideas of a faction of the Russian 
Social-Democratic Labour Party. The Council Communists were aware that many of 
their ideas were situation-specific, and without a doubt much of their writings 
have been passed by through the course of capitalist development. Nevertheless 
the council form continues to appear in revolutionary situations and the belief 
that the key to human emancipation is not State or party, but working people 
themselves is surely still important to the world of today.</p>
