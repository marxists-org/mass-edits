<p>It has been the misfortune of Marxism in the United States that its greatest 
development took place under the influence of the Russian Revolution. Our native 
radicals have displayed a pig-headedness almost equal to that of the bourgeoisie 
itself in continuing to regard &#8216;Leninism&#8217; or &#8216;Marxism-Leninism&#8217; as synonymous 
with, or at least a logical extension of Marxism, and Bolshevism as synonymous 
with Communism. Even two such embattled antagonists as Sidney Hook and Max 
Eastman - the one wanting to be a Marxist and the other a Leninist - are in 
fundamental agreement on this point, and their heated disputes accordingly 
reduce largely to a mere matter of words. It has not yet dawned upon the 
American intellectuals that the Bolshevik Revolution was essentially only a 
bourgeois revolution directed to overthrowing Czarism and doing away with the 
vestiges of feudalism in Russia, thus preparing the way for an unrestricted 
state-capitalist development.</p>

<p>It has been the misfortune of Mattick personally - apart from the 
circumstance that he brought with him from Germany a philosophic mind and style 
- that his work is directed to breaking down these illusions and prejudices and 
to &#8220;cleansing Marxism from the filth of epigonity&#8221;. He recognizes that Marxism 
in its pure and original form was impossible of application during the upgrade 
period of capitalism; that it was necessarily adapted to suit the needs of the 
governing bureaucracy of the old labor movement, and that it is only now, in the 
&#8220;permanent crisis&#8221; when the objective conditions are ripe for the overthrow of 
capitalism, that it is really possible for Marxism to come into its own. Which 
is merely another manner of saying that Marxism can be actualized only through 
the <i>revolutionary</i>
proletariat in the act of throwing off the fetters of capitalism. Mattick 
accordingly rejects all forms of marxian &#8216;orthodoxy&#8217;, including particularly 
those associated with the names of Lenin and Kautsky. Yet, he is an &#8216;orthodox&#8217; 
Marxist himself - but with a difference. In the first place, he makes a 
distinction between mere lip-service to Marxism, or the use of revolutionary 
phrases to conceal reformist or counter-revolutionary practice, on the one hand, 
and the practical application of Marxist principles in the proletarian struggle 
against capitalism on the other. And secondly, to him, as to George Lukacs, 
orthodox Marxism &#8220;does not mean an uncritical acceptance of the results of 
Marx&#8217;s investigations, does not mean a &#8216;belief&#8217; in this or that thesis, nor the 
exegesis of a &#8220;sacred book&#8221;. Orthodoxy in questions of Marxism relates rather 
exclusively to the method. It is the scientific conviction that in dialectical 
Marxism the correct method of investigation has been found, that this method can 
be developed, extended and deepened only in the sense of its founder, and that 
all attempts to overcome or &#8216;improve&#8217; it have led, and necessarily so, merely to 
flatness, triviality and eclecticism&#8221;.</p>

<p>Such a view of orthodoxy enables Mattick to be the most uncompromising of 
Marxists, and at the same time one of those who are least hampered by 
traditions. He recognizes the historical character of all the traditional forms 
of the labor movement, inclusive of parliamentarism and the political party. The 
political party, for instance, is just an expression of formal democracy - one 
which will be permitted to function only so long as the bourgeoisie can afford 
so much leniency - but the revolution itself, under modern conditions in highly 
developed capitalist countries, &#8220;is not a party matter, but the affair of the 
class&#8221; (of the proletarian class be it understood and not of a 
proletarian-peasant alliance such as was indispensable to the overthrow of 
Czarism). All expressions of &#8220;formal democracy&#8221;, inclusive of labor 
organizations, become more and more intolerable to the bourgeoisie in the 
permanent crisis, when the continued existence of capitalism depends on a 
perfectly smooth functioning of the economic organism; but the class struggle 
itself cannot be suppressed - it is simply obliged to assume new forms adapted 
to the new conditions. These new forms are essentially embraced in the workers&#8217; 
councils (soviets), led by committees of action - that is under the direct 
control of the workers themselves, hence not dependent upon the existence of 
parties, not subject to the personal sway of professional &#8220;labor leaders&#8221;, but 
functioning over the heads of all parties and bureaucracies and hence capable of 
effecting a real united front and waging a really common struggle against 
capitalism in its final and more or less &#8216;fascist&#8217; form.</p>

<p>Ever since fascism first made its appearance in Italy, shortly after the War, 
and particularly since the rise of Hitler in Germany and the suppression of the 
Social Democracy in Austria, a reorientation of the labor movement has been 
under way. In this process are revealed two opposite tendencies. One is headed 
in the direction of compromise with capitalistic prejudices, abandonment of 
revolutionary principles and winning the middle classes, as best illustrated in 
this country by the recent &#8220;American Workers&#8217; Party&#8221; (now combined with the 
Communist League to form the &#8220;Workers Party&#8221;). The other sees in the proletariat 
itself the only reliable instrument of the communist revolution and avoids all 
compromise with revolutionary principles as merely calculated to throw confusion 
into the ranks of the workers. It is that latter position which is represented 
by Mattick, in harmony with the &#8220;United Workers&#8217; Party&#8221; of America and the 
&#8220;Groups of International Communists&#8221; of the various countries throughout the 
world. It is essentially the same position as that combatted by Lenin under the 
name of Left Communism - a position which, from the point of view of the Russian 
Revolution, with its petty-bourgeois and jacobinical ideology, was naturally 
anathema at the time to any Bolshevik - as it was also to Noske and Ebert &#8211; but 
which from the international proletarian point of view is revealing itself as 
the one truly revolutionary force in contemporary society.</p>

<p>In the present pamphlet, <i>The Inevitability of Communism</i>, as well as in 
various other writings, such as his critique of the American Workers Party (<i>One 
Step Forward, Two Steps Backward</i>, The Modern Monthly, Dec.1934), Mattick has 
taken pains to show the disastrous consequences of the compromising attitude and 
of the reformist position in all its phases. He understands that fascism itself 
is merely an <i>Ablenkungsmanoever</i>, an attempt to mislead the workers by the 
use of pseudo-revolutionary or at least pseudo-radical phrases, as illustrated 
in the Hitlerian &#8220;National-<i>Socialist </i>German <i>Labor</i>
Party.&#8221; Fascism has copied the tactics of the bolshevik movement in Russia and 
of the national bolshevik parties controlled by the Third International. Fascism 
too pretends to be aiming at a form of &#8220;socialism&#8221;, that is, state capitalism, 
which generally passes for socialism not only among the workers and 
petty-bourgeoisie but even among the so-called socialists themselves. What 
wonder, then, that the workers turn to fascism - a form of &#8216;socialism&#8217; which can 
be introduced by the simple process of voting, without the necessity of a 
revolution with all its unpleasant connotations. Thus when the members of the 
reformist, petty-bourgeois parties - a term which includes even the self-styled 
revolutionary political parties - reproach the workers with being stupid, they 
fail to consider that these parties themselves are largely responsible for that 
&#8216;stupidity&#8217;, in that they put reformist notions into the heads of the workers 
and fail to make a clear-cut distinction between capitalism (in its fascist 
form) and communism (as conceived by Marx, the &#8220;society of free and equal 
producers&#8221;). Thus reformism in its various aspects, including participation in 
capitalist politics, leads logically to fascism, and all the reformist parties 
(regardless of their revolutionary phrases or intentions) will be forced in the 
end either to capitulate to fascism or be suppressed by it - or even both at the 
same time, as in the case of the German C.P., which had lost all revolutionary 
character and become almost as fascist as the Nazis, but which nevertheless has 
to be swept aside as unadapted, or at least less adapted than Hitler&#8217;s party, to 
the needs of the bourgeoisie in the permanent crisis.</p>

<p>These two opposed tendencies in the labor movement imply, of course, 
differences in theoretical base, involving questions not merely of psychology 
but of philosophy and economics. The reformist position is essentially 
opportunistic and undialectical. It is accordingly superficial, content with 
momentary successes, however won and with the aid of whatever elements, without 
regard for ulterior effects on the revolutionary movement and the form of 
society resulting from it. It fails to see in the capitalistic relations 
themselves and in the growth of the forces of production (in particular, the 
growth of the proletariat) the circumstance which makes the eventual triumph of 
communism inevitable, however long that triumph may be postponed by fascism and 
other varieties of reformism. On the one hand, the truly revolutionary tendency, 
which sees in the proletariat itself the antithesis engendered by capitalism, 
and in communism the synthesis resulting from this antagonism, is not concerned 
with catering to the petty-bourgeoisie but with developing the strength and the 
consciousness and the self-confidence of the workers, so that these latter will 
be capable of <i>leading</i> the petty-bourgeoisie instead of being led by it. 
In other words, as Mattick makes plain in the concluding sections of his work, 
it is not so much a question of &#8216;educating&#8217; the workers in communist ideology, 
but one of developing their militancy. Education, in the sense in which the word 
is employed by Sidney Hook and on which he lays so much stress - in common, we 
might say, with socialists and reformists generally - is a matter in which the 
capitalists, so long as capitalism endures, will always have the advantage, if 
not practically a complete monopoly. The great mass of the workers, under 
capitalist conditions, cannot be reached by education at all; and hence to 
depend upon education and propaganda as the main forms of pre-revolutionary 
activity is merely to play into the hands of the reactionaries by indulging the 
sort of illusions characteristic of the socialists, who hold that nothing can be 
done about a new state of society until they have convinced enough people of the 
desirability of socialism to vote the socialist ticket into office. But to 
promote the militancy and self-confidence of the workers, even to the exclusion 
of communist ideology and what, is generally referred to as class consciousness 
in its more intellectual form, is to make the collapse of capitalism inevitable 
in the shortest possible space of time. Their economic struggles under existing 
conditions naturally tend to assume a political form and acquire a revolutionary 
character; the workers may not be Marxists or conscious revolutionists while 
engaged in these struggles, but, as Mattick says , &#8220;the revolution <i>makes</i> 
them Marxists.&#8221;</p>

<p>NO attempt will be made in this brief review to indicate the wealth of 
theoretical material which Mattick brings to the support of his views. Our aim 
is merely to point out the revolutionary significance of his work and to suggest 
the manner in which it differentiates itself from the &#8216;orthodox&#8217; and all forms 
of &#8216;vulgar&#8217; Marxism. The pamphlet was written mainly as a reply to Sidney Hook&#8217;s 
book <i>Towards the Understanding of Karl Marx</i> which is perhaps the one 
distinctively American contribution to Marxism which could be named as in any 
sense worthy of such a critique. Mattick and Hook are, of course, in agreement 
on many specific points (omitted as obvious in the present pamphlet), and their 
differences are sometimes more a matter of emphasis than of fundamental 
opposition. But Hook, in common with all the other people who have tried to 
&#8220;make sense of Marx&#8221; has, we think Mattick clearly shows, merely succeeded in 
reducing what is essentially science to the &#8216;common-sense&#8217; level of 
understanding and not only abandoned Marxism himself but made it all the easier 
for liberals and &#8216;nice people&#8217; generally to feel that they were perfectly 
justified in never concerning themselves with the matter or never taking it 
seriously if they did. Mattick reveals that Marx is more modern than all his 
critics, whether of the pseudo-scientific radical camp like Max Eastman, or of 
the purely liberal type like Stuart Chase. Marx is not only the symbol of 
revolution, which is the only present alternative to world-wide fascism he is 
also the man who has provided the most profound understanding of capitalist 
society, and that insight into economic laws and the movement of social classes 
which is the only sure guide to pursuing a really radical course of action under 
capitalism in its stage of decline. And Mattick, in spite or because of his 
comparative youth, has brought into Marxist theory and the political labor 
movement, a freshness of insight and depth of understanding gained in the course 
of years of experience here and abroad and hitherto lacking in this country.</p>
