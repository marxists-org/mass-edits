<p>There has of late been a tendency by intellectuals who during the present 
crisis have discovered the revolutionary movement to join with the Socialist 
Labor Party in its cult of Daniel De Leon. While these intellectuals remain very 
skeptical towards the S.L.P. they wax quite lyrical about the revolutionary 
abilities and potency of De Leon even going so far as to name him an or the 
American Marx or Lenin. This is quite unjust to the S.L.P. that has ceased to be 
a factor in the revolutionary movement due to its devotion and loyalty to the 
theories and personality of De Leon. Such injustice is, of course, a matter of 
small importance but a distortion of revolutionary theory making a Marx or Lenin 
out of such shoddy material as De Leon is much more serious; not because De 
Leon&#8217;s importance in American revolutionary tradition is heavy enough to allow a 
reinterpretation of his theories and activity to have any influence on the class 
struggle, but because it is an index of the confusion existing in revolutionary 
theory, and if not countered by a correct analysis is a contributory cause 
towards making confusion twice confounded.</p>

<p>Frederich Engels&#8217; conception of De Leon must have been quite different. When 
Lucien Sanial and De Leon visited him in England, his sole comment to a friend 
in the United States was, &#8220;they did not impress me much.&#8221;</p>
<p>The alleged greatness of De Leon is usually based on his conception of 
industrial unionism and his uncompromising stand against any reformist 
compromise. It is unfortunate for the former premise that the refusal of the 
credentials committee to seat him at the 1908 convention of the I.W.W. was due 
to the fact that he was a member of, and a delegate from, a craft local (the 
clerical workers) and had consistently refused to transfer to an industrial 
union local in spite of the insistence of the General Executive Board of the 
I.W.W. that he do so. During the discussion of the credentials committee&#8217;s 
report, in which De Leon was permitted to participate, it was brought out by De 
Leon himself that this was to him not just a question of expediency - preference 
for representing a numerically stronger local - but of principle, i.e. that 
according to De Leon the organization of industrial unions should commence with 
the organization of craft locals.</p>
<p>This attitude of De Leon amounted, in practice, to demanding that the I.W.W. 
retrace the steps of the A.F. of L. before starting out on its own proper 
career, and was the decisive factor swinging many of De Leon&#8217;s former supporters 
against him. As Tom Powers, a delegate from New England, put it: &#8220;No one but De 
Leon himself could convince me that De Leon does not understand industrial 
unionism - but he has done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea prevalent that it was the political action clause that was the issue 
of this convention is merely a deduction from the fact that after the withdrawal 
of the De Leon supporters from the convention, the political clause was struck 
from the I.W.W. preamble but this was merely a result of the anti-political 
faction being in control after the withdrawal of the De Leonites, not the cause 
of this withdrawal.</p>

<p>De Leon&#8217;s second claim to revolutionary fame is even more shaky; to examine 
it, it is necessary to go back to the time of his entrance in the S.L.P., and 
the discussion then raging on the &#8220;who pays the taxes&#8221; problem. On this 
question, De Leon and his supporters held that the workers do not pay any taxes. 
This stand was superficially considered more revolutionary. When the opposing 
faction contended that the question of taxes should furnish one of the main 
planks in the party&#8217;s platform and be considered separately, any revolutionist 
must agree with De Leon that this was only a red herring to draw the workers off 
the revolutionary trail; but, when examining the grounds on which the De 
Leonites took this stand, the question then assumes a sinister significance.</p>

<p>De Leon's argument was that under capitalism wages are determined by the law 
of value of labor power. The workers are therefore unable to improve their 
conditions under capitalism, and vice versa the capitalists are unable to cut 
their wages, the law of value overriding all such subjective notions. From a 
theoretical point of view, this is changing the Marxist conception of the class 
struggle into a conception of society as ruled by &#8220;iron immutable&#8221; laws. This is 
not dialectic materialism, but metaphysical materialism; not the Marxist 
conception of historical materialism, but the bourgeois conception of economic 
determinism. It is a complete repudiation of the subjective factor, reducing the 
human element in the class struggle to nothing; reducing social science to the 
same elements as natural science. In practice, it means the cessation of all 
struggle except the struggle with immediate revolutionary results. This degrades 
the revolution to the level of a miracle; for if the wage level is decided by 
factors outside the determination of capitalists and workers both, then the 
struggles, whether defensive or offensive, about wages, hours, etc., must be 
just that much waste of effort.</p>

<p>Incredible as this may seem, this was the attitude of De Leon; and this is 
the attitude of the S.L.P. today. The position, briefly stated, is this: nothing 
short of a revolution can improve the position of the working class. The two 
methods for accomplishing this were, according to the S.L.P., political and 
economic action, but these two concepts were narrowed down to become mere 
shadows of their original selves.</p>
<p>Political action was, in the main, defined as parliamentarism; but a stern 
attitude was taken against the Socialist Party program of reforms to be gained 
by such methods. Elections were simply thermometers registering the 
&#8220;revolutionary temperature&#8221;. When the proper degree, a majority vote, was 
gained, the workers would assume power but not through their elected 
parliamentary representatives. This task was left to their economic 
organizations: the industrial unions. What were these unions in the meantime to 
do? Merely organize and keep their readiness for their historical mission? A 
program as narrow as this can, of course, not be carried through with perfect 
consistency; but the S.L.P. came very close to this &#8220;ideal&#8221;. On the whole, 
S.L.P. candidates have honestly set forth at elections that, if elected, they 
could accomplish nothing; so, too, the W.I.I.U. organizers hold that unions can 
accomplish nothing for the workers. The result has, of course, been that there 
has been very little response from the mass of the working class. Only those 
very susceptible to revolutionary propaganda can respond to a message as 
severely academic as this. The only measure of success that the S.L.P. has been 
able to gain has therefore been to isolate within its ranks a small number of 
people highly susceptible to revolutionary propaganda, and thereby to restrain 
them from actively participating in any mass struggle.</p>
<p>Corresponding to these theoretical and strategical shortcomings is an equal 
deficiency in tactical principle. De Leon&#8217;s opposition to the anti-political 
faction with the I.W.W. was not an opposition to opportunism and compromise, but 
against the &#8220;advocates of physical force&#8221;. To his notion, political (read 
parliamentary) action plus industrial unionism made any actual physical struggle 
unnecessary. The class struggle could therefore be carried on &#8220;on the civilized 
plane&#8221; with peaceful electioneering, organization and propaganda work. De Leon&#8217;s 
tactical principle therefore became an extreme of legalism and pacifism, and 
anyone failing to worship these fetishes were simply branded as &#8220;enemies of the 
working class&#8221; and agents provocateurs.</p>

<p>The functions of a revolutionist joining the S.L.P. and adhering strictly to 
De Leon&#8217;s principles were limited to a narrow sort of propaganda with no 
practical participation in the daily struggles of the workers, nay even 
disdaining these struggles and deprecating the necessary outbursts of violence 
of an offensive or defensive character incidental to them. The theoretical, 
strategical and tactical principles advocated by De Leon thus made 
revolutionists coming under their influence not only abstain from participation 
in the actual class struggle, but even made them into a counter-revolutionary 
force trying to canalize the spontaneous struggles of the workers into sterile 
channels.</p>

<p>The function of a revolutionary movement is, of course, extremely limited. It 
does not furnish the motive power of the social revolution but only gives 
direction to it, and this even within narrow limits. The working class would, 
even if no revolutionary movement existed, revolt against the oppressive 
conditions that the capitalist system imposes on it. In the absence of a 
revolutionary movement such revolts would be empirical, tentative, blundering. 
The revolutionary movement furnishes not only a record of such revolts, but, by 
analysis, establishes not only a connection between them by linking them 
historically to the past and discerning the relationships between the apparently 
disconnected struggles of the present, but, more important yet, sees the aim 
towards which the struggle is leading. The revolutionary movement is thus the 
central sensory and reasoning apparatus of the working class. And as it is 
impossible for a man to add an ounce of power to his bodily strength by the use 
of his mind and senses, so it is likewise impossible for the revolutionary 
movement to increase the revolutionary force of the working class. But a 
well-trained mind and perfect coordination of nerve and muscle cannot only 
utilize the muscular power of a man to ever better advantage, it can even, over 
a period of time, by suitable training increase bodily strength until tasks 
hitherto impossible can be conquered. It is likewise impossible for the 
revolutionary movement to accomplish any immediate increase in the revolutionary 
force of the working class. What it can do is to lead it into the most useful 
channels and thereby increase its effectiveness; to change it from a blind, 
instinctive, spontaneous, into a conscious, reasoned, deliberate struggle, not 
only for immediate redress of grievances but showing a path to the final aim - 
the rule of the working class as a transition to a classless society. Under such 
direction the revolutionary force of the working class would not only be better 
utilized, but would grow by continuous and rational exercise until it became 
adequate for its final aim.</p>

<p>De Leon&#8217;s theory declared the actual class struggle senseless. His strategy 
would turn it into useless channels, his tactics would offer it as a sacrifice 
on the altar of legalism. De Leon never ceased to be a university professor in 
spirit; practical life had to be simplified into simple abstractions; the class 
struggle to be conducted within an academic, petty-bourgeois framework; and 
before all, no violence; let us be strictly legal. As all other reformists, he 
forgot that only one thing can make a revolution legal &#8211; its success.</p>
