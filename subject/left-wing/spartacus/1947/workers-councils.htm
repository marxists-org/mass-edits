<h2>Communistenbond Spartacus</h2>
<h1>Workers' Councils</h1>
<h3>1947</h3>
<hr>

<p class="fst">Workers' Councils in no way owe their origin to the theoretical 
analysis of society, but they are the result of the intuition of the masses. 
Deprived of every form of organisation, living in the blackest poverty, the 
Russian working class themselves organised their own strikes from below in the 
period 1900-5.</p>

<p class="fst">The Western European method of struggle was practically unknown 
in consequence of the ban on organisations.</p>

<p class="fst">Parties and Trade Unions which in Western Europe were already 
free and strong had no influence on the actions of the Russian working class. In 
Russia, therefore, the workers could not only dispense with conducting the 
struggle through their Party or Trade Union leaders, but they were forced to do 
it themselves in the factories. In the industries, strike committees were formed 
for the organisation of the struggle.</p>

<h4>1905 Struggle</h4>

<p class="fst">The strength of the strike movement in Russia which found its 
culmination in the St. Petersburg Workers' Council (Soviet of 1905) consisted in 
the expansion of the strike over many industries.</p>

<p class="fst">Whilst in Western Europe the consideration of the matter between 
capital and labour (arbitration), the conference-table, the formation of strike 
funds and everywhere the limitation of strikes, were the conditions for the 
class struggle, in Russia it was the contrary.</p>

<h4>One Weapon</h4>

<p class="fst">The Russian masses knew no organised conciliation conference, not 
fighting funds, no congresses, motions, and official leaders. They knew one 
weapon: strikes, organised by themselves from below, passing on from factory to 
factory, and above all, spreading. In every factory a committee was chosen, out 
of which by factory committees joining together, a general committee was chosen. 
These general committees or Workers' Councils had no permanent function, did not 
consist of paid administrators, and were raised up in the struggle itself.</p>

<h4>Bolshevism suborned struggle from 1917</h4>

<p class="fst">The contradiction between the Russian working masses, fighting 
under their own strike leadership, and the gentlemen of the school of scientific 
Socialism, only came out with full clearness in the Russian Revolution of 1917. 
The masses acting on an intuitive impulse must, cost what it would, be made 
subordinate to the General Staff of the Bolshevik Party. Only the General Staff 
knew the way to the classless society, so the masses ought to obey its commands.</p>

<h4>The bloodbath of Kronstad</h4>

<p class="fst">The bloodbath of Kronstad, where the Bolshevik, Trotsky, had 
thousands of workers slaughtered, only because they advanced a point of his own 
party's programme: &quot;All power to the workers' councils&quot; (Soviets) was the 
historical evidence of it.</p>

<p class="fst">If we measure the correctness of a theory by its results, then 
the practice has given judgment. What has the years long Trade Union struggle 
got for the masses? What increase in the standard of living have they go out of 
it? Where are the results of the Party political struggle? The scales tip in 
favour of the self-acting and thinking Russian masses.</p>

<h4>Traitors to Socialism</h4>

<p class="fst">The practice of the class struggle in Europe gives the same 
result. Ninety per cent of the theories of the scientific school have become 
traitors to Socialism and by crooked leadership have diverted the masses further 
from Socialism than ever before.</p>

<h4>How will the workers' commune come?</h4>

<p class="fst">The coming of Socialism will be the result of the uprising of 
great masses of workers joined in one front, organised industrially in workers' 
councils.</p>

<p class="fst">The Trade Unions and political parties must be settled with. They 
form an obstacle in the way for the independent uprising of the masses.</p>

<p class="fst">One must not expect that the Workers' Council idea should be a 
magic charm, that it is only needed to be put into practice in order to bring 
forth results. Far from that.</p>

<p class="fst">Workers' Councils only express the exhausting struggle of the 
workers to rise from their sleep to be free men.</p>

<h4>The instrument is formed</h4>

<p class="fst">The upward climb of the working class, now bound down in wage 
slavery, to the position of a class in a state to rule socially will be a 
lengthy process.</p>

<p class="fst">The skirmishes of vanguards are only carried on to show the 
masses how fighting ought to be done. The workers' councils form the instrument 
whereby and by way of which the workers can free themselves from dependence on 
leadership, in which the can construct in opposition to the Trade Unions and 
political parties, an emancipating power of their own.</p>
