<h4>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h4>
<h3><a name="h2">Kronstadt</a><a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1]</a></h3>

<p class="fst"><i>Petrograd</i>, <i>February</i>, <i>1921</i>.&#8212;The cold is 
extreme and there is intense suffering in the city. Snowstorms have isolated us 
from the provinces; the supply of provisions has almost ceased. Only half a 
pound of bread is being issued now. Most of the houses are unheated. At dusk old 
women prowl about the big woodpile near the Hotel Astoria, but the sentry is 
vigilant. Several factories have been closed for lack of fuel, and the employees 
put on half rations. They called a meeting to consult about the situation, but 
the authorities did not permit it to take place.</p>

<p class="fst">The Trubotchny millworkers have gone on strike. In the 
distribution of winter clothing, they complain, the Communists received undue 
advantage over the non-partisans. The Government refuses to consider the 
grievances till the men return to work.</p>

<p class="fst">Crowds of strikers gathered in the street near the mills, and 
soldiers were sent to disperse them. They were <i>kursanti</i>, Communist youths 
of the military academy. There was no violence.</p>

<p class="fst">Now the strikers have been joined by the men from the Admiralty 
shops and Galernaya docks. There is much resentment against the arrogant 
attitude of the Government. A street demonstration was attempted, but mounted 
troops suppressed it.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>February 27</i>.&#8212;Nervous feeling in the city. The strike 
situation is growing more serious. The Patronny mills, the Baltiysky and Laferm 
factories have suspended operations. The authorities have ordered the strikers 
to resume work. Martial law in the city. The special Committee of Defense (<i>Komitet 
Oboroni</i>) is vested with exceptional powers, Zinoviev at its head.</p>

<p class="fst">At the Soviet session last evening a military member of the 
Defense Committee denounced the strikers as traitors to the Revolution. It was 
Lashevitch. He looked fat, greasy, and offensively sensuous. He called the 
dissatisfied workers "leeches attempting extortion" (<i>shkurniki</i>), and 
demanded drastic measures against them. The Soviet passed a resolution locking 
out the men of the Trubotchny mill. It means deprivation of rations&#8212;actual 
starvation.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>February 28</i>.&#8212;Strikers' proclamations have appeared on the 
streets today. They cite cases of workers found frozen to death in their homes. 
The main demand is for winter clothing and more regular issue of rations. Some 
of the circulars protest against the suppression of factory meetings. "The 
people want to take counsel together to find means of relief," they state. 
Zinoviev asserts the whole trouble is due to Menshevik and Social Revolutionist 
plotting.</p>

<p class="fst">For the first time a political turn is being given to the 
strikes. Late in the afternoon a proclamation was posted containing larger 
demands. "A complete change is necessary in the policies of the Government," it 
reads. "First of all, the workers and peasants need freedom. They don't want to 
live by the decrees of the Bolsheviki; they want to control their own destinies. 
We demand the liberation of all arrested Socialists and non-partisan workingmen; 
abolition of martial law; freedom of speech, press, and assembly for all who 
labor; free election of shop and factory committees, of labor union and Soviet 
representatives."</p>

<p class="fst"><i>March 1</i>.&#8212;Many arrests are taking place. Groups of strikers 
surrounded by Tchekists, on their way to prison, are a common sight. Much 
indignation in the city. I hear that several unions have been liquidated and 
their active members turned over to the Tcheka. But proclamations continue to 
appear. The arbitrary stand of the authorities is having the effect of rousing 
reactionary tendencies. The situation is growing tense. Calls for the <i>
Utchredilka</i> (Constituent Assembly) are being heard. A manifesto is 
circulating, signed by the "Socialist Workers of the Nevsky District," openly 
attacking the Communist régime. "We know who is afraid of the Constituent 
Assembly," it declares. "It is they who will no longer be able to rob us. 
Instead they will have to answer before the representatives of the people for 
their deceit, their thefts, and all their crimes."</p>

<p class="fst">Zinoviev is alarmed; he has wired to Moscow for troops. The local 
garrison is said to be in sympathy with the strikers. Military from the 
provinces has been ordered to the city: special Communist regiments have already 
arrived. Extraordinary martial law has been declared today.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>March 2</i>.&#8212;Most disquieting reports. Large strikes have 
broken out in Moscow. In the Astoria I heard today that armed conflicts have 
taken place near the Kremlin and blood has been shed. The Bolsheviki claim the 
coincidence of events in the two capitals as proof of a counter-revolutionary 
conspiracy.</p>

<p class="fst">It is said that Kronstadt sailors have come to the city to look 
into the cause of trouble. Impossible to tell fact from fiction. The absence of 
a public press encourages the wildest rumors. The official papers are 
discredited.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>March 3</i>.&#8212;Kronstadt is disturbed. It disapproves of the 
Government's drastic methods against the dissatisfied workers. The men of the 
warship <i>Petropavlovsk</i> have passed a resolution of sympathy with the 
strikers.</p>

<p class="fst">It has become known today that on February 28 a committee of 
sailors was sent to this city to investigate the strike situation. Its report 
was unfavorable to the authorities. On March 1 the crews of the First and Second 
Squadrons of the Baltic Fleet called a public meeting at Yakorny Square. The 
gathering was attended by 16,000 sailors, Red Army men, and workers. The 
Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Kronstadt Soviet, the Communist 
Vassiliev, presided. The audience was addressed by Kalinin, President of the 
Republic, and by Kuzmin, Commissar of the Baltic Fleet. The attitude of the 
sailors was entirely friendly to the Soviet Government, and Kalinin was met on 
his arrival in Kronstadt with military honors, music, and banners.</p>

<p class="fst">At the meeting the Petrograd situation and the report of the 
sailors' investigating committee were discussed. The audience was outspoken in 
its indignation at the means employed by Zinoviev against the workers. President 
Kalinin and Commissar Kusmin berated the strikers and denounced the 
Petropavlovsk Resolution as counter-revolutionary. The sailors emphasized their 
loyalty to the Soviet system, but condemned the Bolshevik bureaucracy. The 
resolution was passed.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>March 4</i>.&#8212;Great nervous tension in the city. The strikes 
continue; labor disorders have again taken place in Moscow. A wave of discontent 
is sweeping the country. Peasant uprisings are reported from Tambov, Siberia, 
the Ukraina, and Caucasus. The country is on the verge of desperation. It was 
confidently hoped that with the end of civil war the Communists would mitigate 
the severe military régime. The Government had announced its intention of 
economic reconstruction, and the people were eager to coöperate. They looked 
forward to the lightening of the heavy burdens, the abolition of war-time 
restrictions, and the introduction of elemental liberties.</p>

<p class="fst">The fronts are liquidated, but the old policies continue, and 
labor militarization is paralyzing industrial revival. It is openly charged that 
the Communist Party is more interested in entrenching its political power than 
in saving the Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">An official manifesto appeared today. It is signed by Lenin and 
Trotsky and declares Kronstadt guilty of mutiny (<i>myatezh</i>). The demand of 
the sailors for free Soviets is denounced as "a counter-revolutionary conspiracy 
against the proletarian Republic." Members of the Communist Party are ordered 
into the mills and factories to "rally the workers to the support of the 
Government against the traitors." Kronstadt is to be suppressed.</p>

<p class="fst">The Moscow radio station sent out a message addressed "to all, 
all, all":</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Petrograd is orderly and quiet, and even the few factories where 
accusations against the Soviet Government were recently voiced now understand 
that it is the work of provocators ... just at this moment, when in America a 
new Republican régime is assuming the reins of government and showing 
inclination to take up business relations with Soviet Russia, the spreading of 
lying rumors and the organization of disturbances in Kronstadt have the sole 
purpose of influencing the American President and changing his policy toward 
Russia. At the same time the London Conference is holding its sessions, and the 
spreading of similar rumors must influence also the Turkish delegation and make 
it more submissive to the demands of the Entente. The rebellion of the <i>
Petropavlovask</i> crew is undoubtedly part of a great conspiracy to create 
trouble within Soviet Russia and to injure our international position ... This 
plan is being carried out within Russia by a Tsarist general and former 
officers, and their activities are supported by the Mensheviki and Social 
Revolutionists."</p>

<p class="fst">The whole Northern District is under martial law and all 
gatherings are interdicted. Elaborate precautions have been taken to protect the 
Government institutions. Machine guns are placed in the Astoria, the living 
quarters of Zinoviev and other prominent Bolsheviki. These preparations are 
increasing general nervousness. Official proclamations command the immediate 
return of the strikers to the factories, prohibit suspension of work, and warn 
the populace against congregating in the streets.</p>

<p class="fst">The Committee of Defense has initiated a "cleaning" of the city. 
Many workers suspected of sympathizing with Kronstadt have been placed under 
arrest. All Petrograd sailors and part of the garrison thought to be 
"untrustworthy" have been ordered to distant points, while the families of 
Kronstadt sailors living in Petrograd are held as hostages. The Committee of 
Defense notified Kronstadt that "the prisoners are kept as 'pledges' for the 
safety of the Commissar of the Baltic Fleet, N. N. Kusmin, the Chairman of the 
Kronstadt Soviet, T. Vassiliev, and other Communists. If the least harm be 
suffered by our comrades, the hostages will pay with their lives."</p>

<p class="fst">"We want no bloodshed," Kronstadt wired in reply. "Not a single 
Communist has been harmed by us."</p>

<p class="fst">The Petrograd workers are anxiously awaiting developments. They 
hope that the intercession of the sailors may turn the situation in their favor. 
The term of office of the Kronstadt Soviet is about to expire, and arrangements 
are being made for the coming elections.</p>

<p class="fst">On March 2 a conference of delegates took place, at which 300 
representatives of the ships, the garrison, the labor unions and factories were 
present, among them also a number of Communists. The Conference approved the 
Resolution passed by the mass-meeting the previous day. Lenin and Trotsky have 
declaredit counter-revolutionary and proof of a White conspiracy.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2]</a></p>

<p class="sub">RESOLUTION OF THE GENERAL MEETING<br>
OF THE CREWS OF THE FIRST AND<br>
SECOND SQUADRONS OF THE<br>
BALTIC FLEET</p>

<p class="sub">HELD MARCH 1, 1921</p>

<p class="quoteb">Having heard the report of the representatives sent by the 
General Meeting of Ship Crews to Petrograd to investigate the situation there, 
Resolved:</p>

<p class="quoteb">1. In view of the fact that the present Soviets do not express 
the will of the workers and peasants, immediately to hold new elections by 
secret ballot, the pre-election campaign to have full freedom of agitation among 
the workers and peasants;</p>

<p class="quoteb">2. To establish freedom of speech and press for workers and 
peasants, for Anarchists and Left Socialist parties;</p>

<p class="quoteb">3. To secure freedom of assembly for labor unions and peasant 
organizations;</p>

<p class="quoteb">4. To call a non-partisan Conference of the workers, Red Army 
soldiers and sailors of Petrograd, Kronstadt, and of Petrograd Province, no 
later than March 19, 1921;</p>

<p class="quoteb">5. To liberate all political prisoners of Socialist parties, as 
well as all workers, peasants, soldiers, and sailors imprisoned in connection 
with the labor and peasant movements;</p>

<p class="quoteb">6. To elect a Commission to review the cases of those held in 
prison and concentration camps;</p>

<p class="quoteb">7. To abolish all <i>politodeli</i> (political bureaus) because 
no party should be given special privileges in the propagation of its ideas or 
receive the financial support of the Government for such purposes. Instead there 
should be established educational and cultural commissions, locally elected and 
financed by the Government;</p>

<p class="quoteb">8. To abolish immediately all <i>zagraditelniye otryadi</i> 
(Armed units organized by the Bolsheviki for the purpose of suppressing traffic 
and confiscating foodstuffs and other products. The irresponsibility and 
arbitrariness of their methods were proverbial throughout the country).</p>

<p class="quoteb">9. To equalize the rations of all who work, with the exception 
of those employed in trades detrimental to health;</p>

<p class="quoteb">10. To abolish the Communist fighting detachments in all 
branches of the Army, as well as the Communist guards kept on duty in mills and 
factories. Should such guards or military detachments be found necessary, they 
are to be appointed in the Army from the ranks, and in the factories according 
to the judgment of the workers;</p>

<p class="quoteb">11. To give the peasants f ull f freedom of action in regard to 
their land, and also the right to keep cattle, on condition that the peasants 
manage with their own means; that is, without employing hired labor;</p>

<p class="quoteb">12. To request all branches of the Army, as well as our 
comrades, the military <i>kursanti</i>, to concur in our resolutions;</p>

<p class="quoteb">13. To demand for the latter publicity in the press;</p>

<p class="quoteb">14. To appoint a Traveling Commission of Control;</p>

<p class="quoteb">15. To permit free <i>kustarnoye</i> (individual small scale) 
production by one's own efforts.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Resolution passed unanimously by Brigade Meeting, two persons 
refraining from voting.</p>

<p class="quoter">PETRICHENKO, Chairman Brigade Meeting.<br>
PEREPELKIN, Secretary.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Resolution passed by an overwhelming majority of the Kronstadt 
garrison.</p>

<p class="quoter">VASSILIEV, Chairman.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Kalinin and Vassiliev vote against the Resolution.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>March 4</i>.&#8212;Late at night. The extraordinary session of the 
Petro-Soviet in the Tauride Palace was packed with Communists, mostly 
youngsters, fanatical and intolerant. Admission by special ticket; a <i>propusk</i> 
(permit) also had to be secured to return home after interdicted hours. 
Representatives of shops and labor committees were in the galleries, the seats 
in the main body having been occupied by Communists. Some factory delegates were 
given the floor, but the moment they attempted to state their case, they were 
shouted down. Zinoviev repeatedly urged the meeting to give the opposition an 
opportunity to be heard, but his appeal lacked energy and conviction.</p>

<p class="fst">Not a voice was raised in favor of the Constituent Assembly. A 
millworker pleaded with the Government to consider the complaints of the workers 
who are cold and hungry. Zinoviev replied that the strikers are enemies of the 
Soviet régime. Kalinin declared Kronstadt the headquarters, of General 
Kozlovsky's plot. A sailor reminded Zinoviev of the time when he and Lenin were 
hunted as counter-revolutionists by Kerensky and were saved by the very sailors 
whom they now denounce as traitors. Kronstadt demands only honest elections, he 
declared. He was not allowed to proceed. The stentorian voice and impassioned 
appeal of Yevdakimov, Zinoviev's lieutenant, wrought the Communists up to a high 
pitch of excitement. His resolution was passed amid a tumult of protest from the 
non-partisan delegates and labor men. The resolution declared Kronstadt guilty 
of a counter-revolutionary attempt against the Soviet régime and demands its 
immediate surrender. It is a declaration of war.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>March 5</i>.&#8212;Many Bolsheviki refuse to believe that the Soviet 
resolution will be carried out. It were too monstrous a thing to attack by force 
of arms the "pride and glory of the Russian Revolution," as Trotsky christened 
the Kronstadt sailors. In the circle of their friends many Communists threaten 
to resign from the Party should such a bloody deed come to pass.</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky was to address the Petro-Soviet last evening. His failure 
to appear was interpreted as indicating that the seriousness of the situation 
has been exaggerated. But during the night he arrived and today he issued an 
ultimatum to Kronstadt:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The Workers' and Peasants' Government has decreed that Kronstadt 
and the rebellious ships must immediately submit to the authority of the Soviet 
Republic. Therefore, I command all who have raised their hand against the 
Socialist fatherland to lay down their arms at once. The obdurate are to be 
disarmed and turned over to the Soviet authorities. The arrested Commissars and 
other representatives of the Government are to be liberated at once. Only those 
surrendering unconditionally may count on the mercy of the Soviet Republic.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Simultaneously I am issuing orders to prepare to quell the mutiny 
and subdue the mutineers by force of arms. Responsibility for the harm that may 
be suffered by the peaceful population will fall entirely upon the heads of the 
counterrevolutionary mutineers.</p>

<p class="quoteb">This warning is final."</p>

<p class="quoter">TROTSKY,<br>
<i>Chairman Revolutionary Mititary <br>
Soviet of the Republic</i>.</p>

<p class="quoter">KAMENEV,<br>
<i>Commander-in-Chief</i>.</p>

<p class="fst">The city is on the verge of panic. The factories are closed, and 
there are rumors of demonstrations and riots. Threats against Jews are becoming 
audible. Military forces continue to flow into Petrograd and environs. Trotsky 
has sent another demand to Kronstadt to surrender, the order containing the 
threat: "I'll shoot you like pheasants." Even some Communists are indignant at 
the tone assumed by the Government. It is a fatal error, they say, to interpret 
the workers' plea for bread as opposition. Kronstadt's sympathy with the 
strikers and their demand for honest elections have been turned by Zinoviev into 
a counter-revolutionary plot. I have talked the situation over with several 
friends, among them a number of Communists. We feel there is yet time to save 
the situation. A commission in which the sailors and workers would have 
confidence, could allay the roused passions and find a satisfactory solution of 
the pressing problems. It is incredible that a comparatively unimportant 
incident, as the original strike in the Trubotchny mill, should be deliberately 
provoked into civil war with all the bloodshed it entails.</p>

<p class="fst">The Communists with whom I have discussed the suggestion all 
favor it, but dare not take the initiative. No one believes in the Kozlovsky 
story. All agree that the sailors are the staunchest supporters of the Soviets; 
their object is to compel the authorities to grant needed reforms. To a certain 
degree they have already succeeded. The <i>zagraditelniye otryadi</i>, 
notoriously brutal and arbitrary, have been abolished in the Petrograd province, 
and certain labor organizations have been given permission to send 
representatives to the villages for the purchase of food. During the last two 
days special rations and clothing have also been issued to several factories. 
The Government fears a general uprising. Petrograd is now in an "extraordinary 
state of siege"; being out of doors is permitted only till nine in the evening. 
But the city is quiet. I expect no serious upheaval if the authorities can be 
prevailed upon to take a more reasonable and just course. In the hope of opening 
the road to a peaceful solution, I have submitted to Zinoviev a plan of 
arbitration signed by persons friendly to the Bolsheviki:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"To the Petrograd Soviet of Labor and Defense,</p>

<p class="quoteb">CHAIRMAN ZINOVIEV:</p>

<p class="quoteb">To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal. Recent events 
impel us Anarchists to speak out and to declare our attitude in the present 
situation.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The spirit of ferment manifest among the workers and sailors is 
the result of causes that demand our serious attention. Cold and hunger had 
produced discontent, and the absence of any opportunity for discussion and 
criticism is forcing the workers and sailors to air their grievances in the 
open.</p>

<p class="quoteb">White-guardist bands wish and may try to exploit this 
dissatisfaction in their own class interests. Hiding behind the workers and 
sailors they throw out slogans of the Constituent Assembly, of free trade, and 
similar demands.</p>

<p class="quoteb">We Anarchists have long exposed the fiction of these slogans, and 
we declare to the whole world that we will fight with arms against any 
counter-revolutionary attempt, in coöperation with all friends of the Social 
Revolution and hand in hand with the Bolsheviki.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Concerning the conflict between the Soviet Government and the 
workers and sailors, we hold that it must be settled not by force of arms, but 
by means of comradely agreement. Resorting to bloodshed, on the part of the 
Soviet Government, will not&#8212;in the given situation&#8212;intimidate or quieten the 
workers. On the contrary, it will serve only to aggravate matters and will 
strengthen the hands of the Entente and of internal counter-revolution.</p>

<p class="quoteb">More important still, the use of force by the Workers' and 
Peasants' Government against workers and sailors will have a demoralizing effect 
upon the international revolutionary movement and will result in incalculable 
harm to the Social Revolution.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Comrades Bolsheviki, bethink yourselves before it is too late! Do 
not play with fire: you are about to take a most serious and decisive step.</p>

<p class="quoteb">We hereby submit to you the following proposition: Let a 
Commission be selected to consist of five persons, inclusive of two Anarchists. 
The Commission is to go to Kronstadt to settle the dispute by peaceful means. In 
the given situation this is the most radical method. It will be of international 
revolutionary significance.</p>

<h4>Petrograd, March 5, 1921.</h4>

<p class="fst"><i>March 6</i>.&#8212;Today Kronstadt sent out by radio, A statement of 
its position. It reads:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Our cause is just, we stand for the power of Soviets, not 
parties. We stand for freely elected representatives of the laboring masses. The 
substitute Soviets manipulated by the Communist Party have always been deaf to 
our needs and demands; the only reply we have ever received was shooting ... 
Comrades! They deliberately pervert the truth and resort to most despicable 
defamation ... In Kronstadt the whole power is exclusively in the hands of the 
revolutionary sailors, soldiers and workers&#8212;not with counter-revolutionists led 
by some Kozlovsky, as the lying Moscow radio tries to make you believe ... Do 
not delay, Comrades! join us, get in touch with us: demand admission to 
Kronstadt for your delegates. Only they will tell you the whole truth and will 
expose the fiendish calumny about Finnish bread and Entente offers.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Long live the revolutionary proletariat and the peasantry!</p>

<p class="quoteb">Long live the power of freely elected Soviets."</p>

<p class="fst"><i>March 7</i>.&#8212;Distant rumbling reaches my ears as cross the 
Nevsky. It sounds again, stronger and nearer, as if rolling toward me. All at 
once I realize that artillery is being fired. It is 6 P.M. Kronstadt has been 
attacked!</p>

<p class="fst">Days of anguish and cannonading. My heart is numb with despair; 
something has died within me. The people on the streets look bowed with grief, 
bewildered. No one: trusts himself to speak. The thunder of heavy guns rends the 
air.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>March 17</i>.&#8212;Kronstadt has fallen today.</p>

<p class="fst">Thousands of sailors and workers lie dead in its streets. Summary 
execution of prisoners and hostages continues.</p>

<p class="fst"><i>March 18</i>.&#8212;The victors are celebrating the anniversary of 
the Commune of 1871. Trotsky and Zinoviev denounce Thiers and Gallifet for the 
slaughter of the Paris rebels ...</p>
