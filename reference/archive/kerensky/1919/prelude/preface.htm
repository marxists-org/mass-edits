<p class="fst">DEAR FRIENDS,</p>

<p class="fst">I send you the stenographic copies of my fundamental statement on the Kornilov
affair which have been saved from destruction, with supplementary remarks and
explanations which I have now made. I place this manuscript at your disposal
and ask you if possible to publish it, but exactly in its present form. This is
necessary, though I myself see all its imperfections from a literary point of
view. But this is not a literary production, not "memoirs" for history, not the
fruit of my unfettered creative faculty. This is only a document, a bit of real
life, a document which can give to those who are really anxious to discover the
truth about the Kornilov affair, more information than a whole volume of
"memoirs", because, without forcing any one to form an opinion, it gives every
one the opportunity of acting on the lines of a commission of inquiry, of doing
the work of such a commission himself, sorting out the most important facts of
the Kornilov affair, and drawing his own conclusions about it.</p>

<p class="fst">To enable the reader to judge fairly is my only desire. My latest notes
supplement the statement received by the Commission of Inquiry with additional
matter which may in part have been forgotten by or unknown to those who will
read the official report of my examination.</p>

<p class="fst">Certainly in these notes I have been unable to confine myself all the time
strictly to the mere facts of the case, and to the narrow limits of the story
of Kornilov's attempt, though I tried my best to refrain from all digression,
and especially from argument and deductions. I tried to restrain myself because
I found that for me at this moment any other language than that of facts and
documents was out of place.</p>

<p class="fst">Why? You know that better than I. You know better than I how the enemies of
the February revolution, my enemies from the Right and from the Left, took
advantage of the Kornilov affair, and how large was the number of those whose
faith weakened before the persistent attacks of my slanderers. It was not for
those who deliberately slandered, not for those who deliberately lied, that I
wrote. It is impossible to convince them of anything. They themselves knew
perfectly well that they were distorting and making a mockery of the truth.</p>

<p class="fst">I wrote for those who knew little or nothing, who in the end gave credence
to what was so insolently described as "truth" in the Kornilov affair. I do not
want to convince them. Let them, dispassionately and calmly, after acquainting
themselves with the facts, not from the words of others, but by their own
reasoning, discover the truth for themselves if not of the whole Kornilov
affair, at least of my connection with it.</p>

<p class="fst">It is not personal interest that urges me at this terrible time to think and
to write of the Kornilov affair. No; I have seen and studied too many people,
not to know the real value of popular love and hatred. At the time when I was
at my height, and the crowd bowed before me, I quietly said to my friends:
"Wait, and they will come and smite me". So it always has been, and
so it always will be. No personal motive, I say, but a public one impelled me
to write. For now, when the enemies of Russia and of the freedom of all peoples
have attained their shameful aims, when our Motherland lies prostrate in the
mud, dishonoured and lacerated, when utter despair has seized those who have
any honours and conscience left now those who have attained their aims must not
be allowed to justify their Judas-like crime by hypocritically imputing it to
"the treason of others" and the memory of the great Russian Revolution,
which created a new life of truth and sincerity, must not be shadowed by even
the smallest doubt as to the honesty of those who strove for it in life and
death.</p>

<p class="fst">I want to say a few more words about General Kornilov. I have written many
things against him. But I do not desire that more should be found in my words
than I intended to say, and that is why I feel obliged to say emphatically that
I have never doubted his love for his country.</p>

<p class="fst">I saw not in bad intention but in a <em>lack of understanding</em>, and in
great political inexperience, the cause of his actions, which menaced Russia
with such a vast upheaval. I saw, and many times I tried to check him,
instigated as he was by the cunning enemies of freedom, or by mere political
sharpers.</p>

<p class="fst">I did not succeed; the man who in his own way loved Russia passionately was
doomed by some power to bring about the victory of those who hated and despised
her.</p>

<p class="fst">PS. - A few words about the stenographed copy. I gave evidence on October 8,
1917. It took several days to decipher the notes of the evidence, and only five
or six days before October 25th I received it to revise and sign. I had not
time to do so. The final official text of my evidence before the Commission of
Inquiry was not ready when the Bolshevik havoc began.</p>

<p class="fst">Having at length an opportunity to look through this text, I felt I had the
right to correct it editorially and stylistically, to shorten it here and
there, and in some places to add a few additional words, of course without
changing the meaning and tone of the evidence; in two places I found it
expedient to change slightly the order of the account, so as to bring together
separated pieces of evidence about the same point.</p>

<p class="fst">I think that the publication of the whole original official report of the
Inquiry will be useful also as a picture of the judicial examination of one
whom General Alexeiev called the "Master of Destiny". It will enable every one
to recall that period, still near but already so distant, when judicial inquiry
and courts of justice were absolutely free and independent of those in power,
that brief chapter in the history of Russia when "this bourgeois prejudice" in
favour of impartial justice was not trampled on to speed a return to the
traditional Moscow period of "Shemiaka trial".<a href="#n1" name="fn1">[1]</a></p>
