<p class="fst">AFTER the breaking of the Russian front near Tarnopol on the 19th of July,
1917, it was decided to replace the Commander of the South-western front,
General Gutor, and later also the Commander-in-Chief, General Brussilov, and
the choice fell on General Kornilov. Kornilov's good qualities and defects were
both well known to the Provisional Government, but at this moment his good
qualities made him the only suitable candidate. His defects, especially his
impetuosity in success, did not then seem to offer any danger; moreover, the
views that he professed seemed to exclude the possibility of a conflict. He
advocated the cessation of a further offensive; he, alone among the generals,
attributed the responsibility for the failure not only to the soldiers, but
also to the officers. He spoke with sympathy of the army elective
organizations, of the commissaries, and so forth. Therefore the appointment of
Kornilov was due to serious considerations in his favour, and not at all to
"irresponsible influences" on the Premier, Kerensky.</p>

<p class="fst">But after his appointment Kornilov immediately revealed his dangerous side.
In his telegram accepting the duties of Commander-in-Chief he made a series of
demands regarding reforms in the army. These reforms were acceptable in their
essence; they were even approved in principle, and were already being worked
out by the Provisional Government <em>before</em> Kornilov's nomination, but
Kornilov presented his demands in an inadmissible form. He interpreted his
rights as Commander-in-Chief in an even broader way than did the Grand Duke
Nicholas, and he assumed towards the Provisional Government such a tone as
compelled Kerensky to propose his immediate dismissal to the Provisional
Government. Kornilov was, however, permitted to retain his command, partly to
avoid changes in the High Command at that critical moment, and partly because
his conduct was ascribed to the influence of adventurers surrounding him at
Headquarters. After the events of the beginning of July, 1917 (the breaking of
the front and the Bolshevik rebellion in Petrograd), the Provisional
Government, supported by the whole of the country and in particular by the
democracy, quickly took a series of energetic steps, including the restoration
of capital punishment at the front, and occupied itself in further planning for
the reorganizing of the army. In spite of this, Kornilov, supported by
Savinkov, started an energetic campaign against the Provisional Government. On
his arrival in Petrograd on the 3rd of August for the purpose of giving the
Provisional Government an account of the military situation, Kornilov brought
with him a memorandum in which he demanded a series of army reforms, but the
discussion of the proposed changes in the army was delayed, and Kornilov's
memorandum was handed to the War Ministry to be brought into agreement with the
proposals of the War Minister. In this way was prevented the publication of
Kornilov's memorandum in a form so exceedingly sharp and tactless that it would
inevitably have led to his retirement.</p>

<p class="fst">In the meantime the attack on the Provisional Government by those in favour
of "decisive measures" was being continued. Kornilov's memorandum of the
3rd of August was handed over to Savinkov, the Deputy Minister of War, for the
purpose of co-ordinating it with the plans of the War Minister. Savinkov, who
all the time was attempting to carry on a personal line of politics without
taking into consideration the directions of his chief, the War Minister, wanted
to benefit by this occasion and, with Kornilov's help, to force the Government
to accept quickly, <em>en bloc</em>, a program of most serious military
measures at the front and at the rear without these measures having first
received the sanction of Kerensky, the Prime Minister and the Minister of War,
and even without previously reporting to him about them.</p>

<p class="fst">This attempt, made immediately before the Moscow Conference, did not
succeed, but still it created great excitement in political circles. This
excitement might have manifested itself at the Moscow Conference in an acute
form, and the Government took measures to save the unity of the country and to
safeguard the army from all possible disputes. Finally, the Moscow Conference
went off without a hitch. General Kornilov made a speech which did not realize
the expectation of the extremists, as it differed from the War Minister's
speech enunciating his program only by its tactless form and a brief allusion
to the necessity of "measures in the rear, at the front, on the railways and in
the factories".</p>

<p class="fst">The regeneration of the fighting capacity of the army was the task of the
Prime Minister, Kerensky, from the very first moment when he took over office
from Gutchkov. It was necessary to liquidate the tendency of army reforms which
had been carried out during the first two months of the Revolution, but in
striving with this object the War Minister, Kerensky, could not permit the too
harsh and premature steps which were demanded by the irresponsible partisans of
"strong power". Such steps could give only a negative result in the unbalanced
conditions in which the country then was. After the Moscow Conference, Savinkov
admitted that the plan of reforms traced by the War Minister coincided in the
main lines with his and Kornilov's wishes. He admitted also that his conduct
during the period just before the Moscow Conference was a breach of discipline,
and after this the Prime Minister recalled the order for Savinkov's
resignation.</p>

<p class="fst">But all the danger from the activities of too hasty "reformers" was nothing
in comparison with the terrible consequences of the secret intrigue which was
carried on at the same time at Headquarters and in other places with the object
of making a forcible <em>coup d'etat</em>, and which already by the time of the
Moscow Conference had attempted to accustom Russia and Kornilov himself to the
idea of the military dictatorship of the latter. Information about conspiracies
began to reach the Provisional Government as early as July, 1917; the break
through near Tarnopol deeply touched the feeling of national pride; moreover,
after the abortive Bolshevik rising many thought that a courageous and well
organized assault on the Government was sure to succeed. Parallel with the open
propaganda of the idea of a military dictatorship, secret work was going on. At
the first stage separate conspirative circles were organized in which some
military elements took an active part, among them a part of the members of the
Main Committee of the old Russian Officers' League, Later, these circles
united, and the technique of the conspiracy improved. Some dubious persons,
such as Aladin and Zavoiko, were accepted in their midst; they formed the link
between the military conspirators, the civil politicians, and the financial
circles that were supporting them. In this way a real organization was created,
which later took such a definite shape that General Alexeiev could menace it
with revelations at the trial of General Kornilov, should the civil
participants, who remained unknown, withhold financial help from the families
of the arrested conspirators. At one time the partisans of "strong power" sent
out feelers to Kerensky; not meeting with any sympathy there, they directed
their attention to Kornilov. "Kerensky does not want to be a dictator; then we
will give him one", said V. Lvov. At the moment of the All-Russian Conference
in Moscow on the 12th-25th of August, the idea of Kornilov's dictatorship
was already quite ripe, and the preparation of the <em>coup d'etat</em>,
anticipating the sympathy of the Conference, was in full swing. A "reliable"
Cossack detachment was summoned to Moscow, and the officer-cadets who were
guarding the building where the Conference took place were given notice that a
proclamation of dictatorship was possible during the Conference. A whole series
of organizations, before the Conference, carried threatening resolutions to the
effect that Kornilov must not be dismissed. A ceremonious entry of Kornilov
into Moscow was being organized; various public men "introduced" themselves and
presented "memoranda". A pamphlet was distributed in Moscow entitled "Kornilov
- The People's Leader".</p>

<p class="fst">Contrary to the expectations of the conspirators, the desire of all parts of
the population for union and the force of the Provisional Government became so
evident at the Moscow Conference that all plans to profit by the Moscow
Conference had to be postponed; on the other hand the conspirative preparation
of the <em>coup d'etat</em> became more intense. A few days later Aladin
attempted through the intermediary of Prince George Lvov to obtain an audience
with Kerensky; having failed, he and his friends deter mined to use V. Lvov for
this purpose, knowing that his position as a former member of the Provisional
Government made it possible for him without difficulty to obtain an audience
with the Prime Minister.</p>

<p class="fst">On the 31st of August Lvov, who was prepared suitably by Aladin and
Dobrinsky, went to Petrograd, where he was received by the Prime Minister, but
he limited himself to a conversation of a general character about the necessity
for strengthening the Government's authority by the inclusion in it of new
elements with "power" behind them. Kerensky did not attach any importance to
this visit, as at that time many people came to him whose conversation was of
this character. Lvov returned to Moscow and went immediately to Headquarters
with a letter from Aladin to Zavoiko. The meaning of this sending of Lvov to
Kerensky, as well as of Aladin's attempt to interview the Prime Minister, was
that the conspirators wished to secure for themselves means of contact with the
Prime Minister independent of the ordinary channels of communication between
Headquarters and the Government.</p>

<p class="fst">At the same time at Headquarters Kornilov and his friends were working out
the final plan of "military" pressure on the Provisional Government. It is
difficult to determine exactly when Kornilov became a conscious participant in
the conspiracy and the head of the movement directed against the Government. In
the first information about the conspiracies his name was not mentioned, but
already on the 3rd of August, in the conversation with Kerensky, Kornilov spoke
about a military dictatorship as about a possibility which might become a
necessity. At the Moscow Conference the behaviour of Kornilov towards the
Provisional Government was very provocative. On the 23rd of August, at
Headquarters, Kornilov spoke harshly to Savinkov about the Provisional</p>

<p class="fst">Government; he found the continuation of Kerensky's power to be obnoxious
and unnecessary and so on. But on the following day, on the 24th of August (6th
of September, N.S.), before Savinkov's departure to Petrograd, Kornilov told
him that he was going loyally to support the Provisional Government; he asked
him to inform Kerensky of this, and Savinkov went away reassured. Now on this
day the work of the conspirators was already in full swing.</p>

<p class="fst">The presence at Headquarters of the Deputy-Minister of War, Savinkov, from
the 22nd to the 24th of August was called for, amongst other reasons, by the
necessity for clearing up the conditions for the transference of the army of
the Petrograd Military District to the Commander-in-Chief, also the conditions
for sending a military detachment from the front at the disposal of the
Provisional Government in connection with the proclamation of martial law in
Petrograd. The proclamation of martial law in Petrograd was necessitated by the
military situation created after the fall of Riga, which had brought the battle
front nearer to the capital, by the necessity for transferring the Government
institutions to Moscow, by the increase in numbers of refugees from the Baltic
provinces and in the licence of the Petrograd garrison, by the proposed
transfer of the other troops of the Petrograd Military District to the command
of General Kornilov, and by the possibility of riots and various attempts from
the Left and from the Right.</p>

<p class="fst">All these considerations compelled the Government to demand for its own use
a well disciplined army force. Savinkov, in transmitting this order of the
Provisional Government to the Commander-in-Chief, pointed out that the strict
conditions for sending troops for the use of the Provisional Government were
that the detachment to be dispatched should not include the Caucasian "Savage
Division" which was not reliable from the Government's standpoint, and
that General Krimov should not be appointed to command it. General Kornilov
definitely <em>promised</em> Savinkov on the 21st of August to fulfil exactly
the proposal of the Provisional Government and not to send to Petrograd either
Krimov or the "Savage Division"; but on the following day the 3rd Cavalry Corps
was already moving towards Petrograd, with the "Savage Division" at its
head, and the whole under the command of General Krimov, who had received
definite instructions from Kornilov. It was proved later that General Krimov,
who had been nominated as commander of one of the armies of the South-western
front in order to divert attention from him, had been already, as a matter of
fact, for some time at Headquarters working out a plan of military pressure
upon the Government. Owing to the events of the 26th of August (September 8th,
N.S.), which will be mentioned later, the Provisional Government had time to
take measures; Krimov's army did not reach Petrograd (where he was expected by
the local conspirative organizations), and he committed suicide. But the role
of this unit was so important in carrying out the conspiracy that it was only
after Kornilov had learned the fate of this detachment that he took actual
measures to put an end to the adventure.</p>

<p class="fst">While General Krimov's detachment was approaching the capital, the
conspirators attempted to get hold of the power "legally" by terrorizing the
Government. On the 26th of August (8th of September, N.S.) Lvov, who had
arrived in Petrograd from Headquarters, presented an ultimatum to the Prime
Minister in the name of Kornilov. The Provisional Government must give up its
power the same evening, transferring it to General Kornilov, who would form a
new Government. Kerensky and Savinkov must immediately, during the night of the
26th-27th of August, depart for Headquarters, as Kornilov proposed to offer
them posts as ministers in his Cabinet and would not take the responsibility
for their lives if they remained in Petrograd. At the request of Kerensky, Lvov
on the spot put in writing Kornilov's demands; then Kerensky asked Kornilov to
come to the direct telegraphic wire, and Kornilov himself repeated to him the
proposal to come immediately, confirmed Lvov's authority, and indirectly
confirmed all that had been said by the latter. To gain time Kerensky promised
Kornilov to come to Headquarters, and at the same time took immediately all
steps to cope with the rebellion at its very commencement. In the meanwhile,
after the above "favourable conversation" by the direct wire, the most
prominent political men in opposition to the Government were invited to
Headquarters; the ultimate form of the dictatorship was being finally settled
and the composition of the Government agreed upon. But on the following day,
the 27th of August, a wire was received from the Prime Minister ordering
Kornilov to surrender his office immediately and to come to Petrograd. Kornilov
did not obey this order, but confirmed to Savinkov by the direct wire his
refusal to submit to the Government. On the same day appeared Kerensky's appeal
to the population about the Kornilov rebellion and Kornilov's appeal saying
that he was "provoked" to make the rebellion and that he was acting
against the Government, which was submitting to the "Bolshevik majority of the
Soviets" and "working in agreement with the plans of the German General
Staff".</p>

<p class="fst">Thus the armed revolt against the Government began. For two days, while this
attempt was being crushed, different "conciliators" besieged the Prime
Minister, attempting to persuade him to compromise "as the real force is on the
side of Kornilov". But already on the 29th of August it became evident that the
whole of the real force of the country was against Kornilov, and, as had been
predicted to him by Kerensky himself some time before, Kornilov found himself
in splendid isolation. On the 13th of August the rebellion was definitely and
bloodlessly suppressed. It was easy to deal with it. Kornilov was not backed by
a single important political organization, nor could he rely upon the force of
any class. Owing to their political inexperience, Kornilov and those of the
officers who were with him mistook for a real force the grumbling of the "man
in the street", irritated by the Revolution, but passive by nature,
together with the instigation of various adventurers and the promises of
support from isolated politicians. The financial help of a certain group of
banking-houses artificially exaggerated the dimensions o f the movement.</p>

<p class="fst">But Kornilov's adventure, though predestined to fail, played a fatal part in
Russia's destiny, as it shook profoundly and painfully the consciousness of the
popular masses. This shock was the more serious as it was unexpected. An
adventure of a small group was transformed in the inflamed imagination of the
masses to a conspiracy of the whole of the bourgeoisie and of all the upper
classes against democracy and the working masses. The Bolsheviks, who up to the
13th of August were impotent, became masters in the Petrograd Soviet of
Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates on the 7th of September, gaining a
majority there for the first time during the whole period of the Revolution.
The same happened everywhere with lightning rapidity. Massacres of officers
again began; again the commanding officers lost all their authority.
"Throughout the whole country, as in the first days of the March Revolution,
there appeared spontaneous organizations which seized the functions of
governmental power under the pretext of fighting the counter-revolution. In the
soldiers' and workmen's masses the authority of the leaders, who were fighting
against the cry of "All authority to the Soviets" and who were defending the
idea of a national power basing its authority on the will of the whole people,
was annihilated. The wave of anarchy broke the Russian front and overflowed the
State. Nobody will ever succeed in breaking the fatal link between the 27th of
August (September 9th, N.S.) and the 25th of October (November 7th, N.S.)
1917.</p>
