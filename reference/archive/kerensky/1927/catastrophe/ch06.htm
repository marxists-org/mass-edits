<h2><a name="h1">CHAPTER VI</a><br>
<small>DISSOLUTION OF THE ARMY</small></h2>

<p class="fst">JUST as the old administrative machinery disappeared suddenly, 
unexpectedly, almost miraculously, in the country, so were the millions at the 
front left without a governing apparatus. The very spirit of the army was gone 
and its heart&#8212;the moving force of the word of command&#8212;ceased to beat.</p>

<p class="fst">Immediately after the Revolution the Russian army ceased to 
fight, for the soldiers ceased to obey and the officers lost the capacity to 
command. The power and authority of the officers disappeared.</p>

<p class="fst">All those who had the opportunity to observe the Russian Front in 
the last year before the Revolution, all those who had any more or less clear 
conception of the atmosphere at the front felt the deadly peril that was 
advancing upon the army together with the dissolution of the old regime. But no 
one expected all these symptoms of exhaustion and decay to culminate in the 
shocking picture of chaos that arose after the Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course, one must not paint the entire Russian Front as it 
appeared after the March explosion in one shade of black. Those troops who had 
won victories in the past or who had as commanders men of the less reactionary 
type, men who had shown sympathy with the more progressive circles of the 
country and had fought for the liberation of the government from the meshes of 
Rasputin, as well as the troops farthest removed from the poisonous influence of 
Petrograd&#8212; in the Caucasus, in the Southwest (Galicia), in Rumania, and the 
Black Sea Fleet&#8212;preserved their organization and their fighting capacity.</p>

<p class="fst">In every individual army the measure of dissolution was likewise 
uneven. As a rule, the artillery and all the specialized branches, containing 
the more intelligent and cultural elements of the army, the elements that had 
been regarded with suspicion under the old regime, remained after the Revolution 
but little touched by the wave of disintegration, or, if disintegration did 
appear, the process was a slow one.</p>

<p class="fst">Above all, it was the infantry which lost the capacity to fight 
and to obey. This is explainable. First of all, the Russian infantry in 1916-17, 
following the terrible defeats of 1914-15, no longer represented a regular army, 
but a poorly trained militia. The various infantry divisions were no longer 
coordinated harmonious bodies. The raw recruits from the villages, who had found 
their way hurriedly and accidentally into the various regiments, had no 
knowledge or conception of their respective regimental traditions. Frequently 
this was the case also with the commanders, the wartime lieutenants, who, after 
two or three months of ephemeral training, were hurled from their student desks 
or office swivel chairs into leadership of the strange gray masses of soldiery.</p>

<p class="fst">But even in the infantry the measure of disorganization was 
varied. The principal fields for the disintegrating propaganda and activity of 
Bolshevist and German agents were the so-called "third" divisions, the formation 
of which was begun in January, 1917. The transformation of the army corps on the 
basis of three instead of two divisions to a corps&#8212;a most unfortunate reform, 
which had met with sharp disapproval from General Alexeyeff and the majority of 
the General Staff officers&#8212;was carried out by General Gurko, temporary chief of 
staff of the commander-in-chief, the Emperor Nicholas II, at the time when 
General Alexeyeff was on furlough in the Crimea because of illness. These 
"third" divisions, consisting of units of which commanders of already existing 
divisions had sought to rid themselves, because of their uselessness, 
represented accidental masses of people without any organization and discipline, 
and operating under the very poorest material and technical conditions. 
Subsequently, during my inspection of the various fronts, I heard loud 
complaints against these accursed "third" divisions, which had become the 
carriers of cowardice, anarchy and disintegration. It was in the infantry where 
the Bolshevist and German agents concentrated their work. Only here did they 
have any real success. Only the very darkest, most ignorant and out and out 
reactionary sections of the Russian army came to the assistance of these worst 
enemies of Free Russia. Here all the slogans of the Revolution merged into one 
solid, brutal roar: "To the devil with the War! Let us go home! You have drunk 
enough of our blood!" The only language which these lower depths of the army 
could understand was the language of force. And as soon as this force was 
restored by the Provisional Government, it was put into effect.</p>

<h4>DREAMS OF PEACE</h4>

<p class="fst">But, at the beginning, in the first weeks of the Revolution, 
there were also other sentiments, in the army, as well as among the people. 
Russia was not only physically tired of the War; New Russia revolted spiritually 
against further bloodshed. She sought, perhaps naively, but honestly and 
sincerely, a way out of the seemingly hopeless <i>impasse</i> into which all 
warring Europe had fallen.</p>

<p class="fst">To many revolutionary enthusiasts, in the rear as well as at the 
front, it appeared only natural that the Russian Revolution, having freed Russia 
from all the evils of the old regime, would bring spiritual emancipation to the 
rest of suffering humanity. An immediate and fair peace for all the belligerent 
nations was the unrealizable but luring, almost hypnotic, struggle dominating 
the heart.</p>

<p class="fst">On March twenty-seventh the Petrograd Soviet of Workmen's and 
Soldiers' Deputies voted its celebrated "Address to all Peoples of the World," 
with an appeal for action for immediate peace. "It will come!" was the confident 
promise. For only the "imperialist governments" were at war with one another, 
while the peoples were compelled merely to obey. Now that the Russian democracy 
has entered as an "equal" into the "family of free peoples," it has renounced 
all the imperialist past of Czarist Russia. There is nothing, therefore, to 
prevent other peoples, acting "over the heads of their governments," from 
following the example of Free Russia and putting an end to the fratricidal 
slaughter. And, first of all, must Germany do away with her imperialist 
reaction. Wilhelm must be deposed, thus piercing the heart of world imperialism. 
And then, in the blinding light of truth and justice, will the new sun of peace 
and love ascend over Europe. The enemies of yesterday will unite in fraternal 
embrace. Thus ran the appeal of the Soviet.</p>

<p class="fst">To the Western world these words appeared to be naive, childish 
prattle. There not only the governments but the peoples themselves were engaged 
in a war to the death. They saw no way out of the war through revolution at 
home. The representatives of Russia's Soviet democracy soon learned this from 
the lips of Socialists and Laborites who had come to visit us from Paris and 
London. They soon learned that their struggle for peace, if it was to be 
successful, must needs be founded not on" rhetoric but upon the solid force of a 
restored front. However, already on March twenty-seventh, at the moment of the 
greatest infatuation with the faith in a European miracle, the leaders of the 
Russian proletarian democracy began to feel certain disquieting misgivings. They 
called upon the German workers to follow the example of their Russian comrades 
and put an end to the absolutism of the Hohenzollerns. But apparently they were 
not quite sure that their appeal would be heard, for among the pleading words of 
the Soviet's address there resounds unexpectedly the cry of warning: "The 
Russian Revolution will not retreat before the bayonets of conquerors and will 
not permit itself to be crushed by outside military power."</p>

<p class="fst">"Peace" with Ludendorff! But imperialist Germany, dominated by 
the dictatorship of Ludendorff, had no intention of threatening the "democratic 
conquests" of the Russian Revolution by resorting to "bayonets." The German 
General Staff was well informed about the sentiments of the Russian democracy 
and the rank and file of the Russian army in the first weeks of the Revolution. 
We find it, therefore, changing its strategy on the Eastern Front with a speed 
and farsightedness worthy of a genius. Instead of directing its heavy artillery 
and the blows of bayonets against Russia, it let loose a storm of proclamations 
more poisonous than the most poisonous gases.</p>

<p class="indentb">The Russian Revolution wants peace. Then why tarry? Why 
overthrow Wilhelm when His Royal Highness, Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria himself, 
Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Front, thinks of nothing else than helping the 
Russian workers and peasants, attired in soldier uniforms, the Russian 
proletarians oppressed by their own and the Anglo-French capitalists, to throw 
off the hated yoke of the international bankers, and by establishing firmly the 
reign of the toiling masses in Russia to bring eternal peace between Russia and 
Germany.</p>

<p class="fst">These were the actual contents of the German proclamations 
distributed among the Russian troops.</p>

<p class="fst">The proclamations of His Royal Highness to the Russian troops 
were not the only means utilized by the Germans in conveying their promise that 
not a single shot would be fired by the Germans without the provocation of an 
offensive by the Russians. Imperial Germany carried still further her diabolical 
play on the primitive <i>naiveté</i> of the Russian soldiers. Here and there 
from the German trenches "peace delegations," bearing white flags, moved towards 
the Russians. These "delegations" were driven away by Russian artillery fire. 
This provoked indignation in the Russian trenches, while new German 
proclamations spared no words of righteous wrath against the unwillingness of 
the Russian generals to give ear to Germany's peace proposals. General 
Dragomiroff then gave orders to receive one such German delegation and bring it 
before him. In the presence of delegates from the army committees the chief 
German parliamentarian was questioned. He had, of course, no peace proposal to 
make.</p>

<p class="fst">This local episode, however, passed by without salutary effect. 
Having provided themselves with such a powerful ally in their struggle for 
"peace at any price" our soldiers met every effort of their commanders to move 
them to action with indescribable resentment.</p>

<p class="fst">The Russian Front grew still. A gravelike silence ensued along 
the hundreds of miles of our lines. Russian soldiers were received as guests by 
the Germans. A wave of fraternization ensued, accompanied by interminable 
meetings. There was plenty of time for that, for the Russian troops refused even 
to clean their rifles. A virtual armistice was established on the Russian Front, 
while the friends of the Russian Revolution in the German General Staff were 
hurrying their Eastern divisions to the French Front.</p>

<h4>STOKHOD</h4>

<p class="fst">It is difficult to say what the result of this situation might 
have been. But in the very midst of the game staged by the Germans there 
occurred a slight mistake. The heyday of the touching friendship between Prince 
Rupprecht and General Ludendorff with our illiterate Russian peasants in the 
trenches came to a sudden end.</p>

<p class="fst">At the moment of the greatest inactivity on the Russian Front the 
German troops suddenly assumed the offensive on the Stokhod. The quick blow 
produced great results. The Russian regiments, far removed from any idea of 
fighting, were caught unawares. Great masses of artillery and 25,000 prisoners 
constituted the German booty&#8212;the first result of the "struggle for peace" 
through fraternization, carried on in accordance with the instructions of 
Ludendorff and Lenin.</p>

<p class="fst">The impression produced by the Stokhod attack on that portion of 
the Russian democracy which was sincerely engaged in the struggle for an 
immediate, just peace was in truth shattering. Ludendorff, as he himself admits 
in his memoirs, quickly perceived the mistake of the German High Command. At 
German Headquarters it was decided not to permit the repetition of unfortunate 
accidents. There will be no more German attacks on the Russian Front, was the 
information conveyed to our trenches by the German command. This promise was 
kept by Ludendorff.</p>

<p class="fst">However, fortunately for us, the impression produced by the 
Stokhod offensive could not be eradicated. Somewhere in the subconsciousness of 
the soul of the Russian democracy occurred a deep and profound change.</p>

<p class="fst">With the Stokhod attack ended what may be called the pacifist 
period of the Russian Revolution. A new period, the period of defense, began. 
The Russian Revolution itself, and not the "imperialist" Provisional Government 
alone, determined to continue the War as long as circumstances demanded it. Of 
course, this new psychology of defense, which began to develop in the 
consciousness of the masses, did not appear in full force immediately after the 
Stokhod attack. On the contrary, the outer picture of the situation at the front 
and in the rear seemed more hopeless than ever and insoluble. At any rate, it 
was thus that the situation was regarded by Alexander Gutchkoff, the first war 
minister of the Provisional Government, and by his closest associates.</p>
