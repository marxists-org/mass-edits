<h2><a name="h1">CHAPTER II</a><br>
<small>BEFORE THE CRASH</small></h2>

<p class="fst">THE months immediately preceding the outbreak of the Great War 
found Russia seething with revolutionary sentiment.</p>

<p class="fst">Political leaders who kept in constant, active contact with all 
elements of the population realized that Russia stood on the eve of a new 
upheaval, and were preparing for it. With a group of friends I spent the spring 
and summer of 1914 in traveling from one end of Russia to the other, organizing 
and marshaling everywhere the political and social forces of the country for the 
coming joint offensive of all bourgeois liberal, proletarian and peasant parties 
and organizations against Czarism, and for the establishment of a democratic 
parliamentary regime.</p>

<p class="fst">I was firmly convinced that the revolutionary movement would 
break out openly before very long. Enormous mass meetings, attended by many 
thousands, conspiratory gatherings in the provincial cities, and the passive 
attitude of the Czarist authorities towards the frank expression of the people's 
will at my mass meetings all evidenced a deep psychological crisis, of the kind 
that always precedes the final act of an advancing revolutionary movement and a 
radical change in the supreme political authority of a nation.</p>

<p class="fst">I remember well the arrival of the dispatch announcing Austria's 
ultimatum to Serbia. I was in Samara, a big political and commercial center on 
the Volga. It was late in the evening and I had just come from a great mass 
meeting. The city was throbbing with political excitement. Next morning I 
boarded a steamer to go to Saratoff, the leading city of my Duma constituency, 
where preparations had been made for another rally. With me were a group of 
political coworkers and friends who had come to see us off. We were exchanging 
latest impressions and expressing amazement at the mounting fever heat of the 
political situation in the country, the tensity of which was surprising even to 
us. Suddenly we perceived a group of newsboys running towards the gangplank, 
crying: "Austria's Ultimatum to Serbia!" In that moment our mood underwent a 
decided change; in the cry of the newsboys we sensed at once the first breath of 
the historic hurricane.</p>

<p class="fst">The entire international situation in Europe left no doubt that 
war was inevitable. Bidding good-by to our local friends, we boarded the 
steamer. Nothing seemed altered in the serene expanse of the mighty river, the 
boiling summer sun, the merry passengers disporting themselves on deck. Without 
talking to any one and concealing our troubled spirit, our little group of 
political workers from the Duma hurriedly called a "council of war." It was 
decided to cancel our propaganda tour at once, to halt the internal political 
struggle and to return immediately to Petrograd. We realized that it was 
necessary to concentrate all the strength of the country upon the organization 
of the national defense, as it was quite clear that the government, enmeshed in 
Rasputin's web, would not be able to handle the task of the War and would bring 
Russia to defeat and ruin.</p>

<p class="fst">Quite intuitively I perceived that Czarism would not survive the 
War and that on the fields of battle would Russia's liberty be born. It was thus 
that, as the representative of the Labor party in the Duma, I later formulated 
this thought at the Duma's historic session upon the occasion of the official 
declaration of war.</p>

<p class="fst">On the steamer I expressed the same thought to none other than 
the sister of Nicolai Lenin. The explanation of my conversation with the sister 
of the chieftain of Bolshevism is perhaps not without interest. The Ulianoff 
(Lenin) and Kerensky families had lived in Simbirsk, on the Volga. My father had 
been principal of the two local high schools, one for boys and the other for 
girls. Lenin's father, Ulianoff (the future head of the so-called Soviet 
government adopted the name of Lenin as a pseudonym), had been inspector of 
elementary schools in the province of Simbirsk. All his children had been 
educated in the local high schools, under my father's supervision. After old 
Ulianoff's death, my father, by virtue of his close association with the 
Ulianoff family, had become the family's guardian. In the reminiscences of my 
childhood I have retained no impressions of Nicolai Lenin and his brothers and 
sisters, as there was a wide difference in our ages. It was quite natural, 
however, that meeting Lenin's sister accidentally on a river steamboat I should 
have entered into conversation with her. After exchanging a few reminiscences of 
our childhood days, the conversation turned upon Lenin himself, who had been 
living for many years as a political exile in Western Europe.</p>

<p class="fst">"But don't worry," I said. "You will soon see him again. There 
will be war and it will open to him the road to Russia."</p>

<p class="fst">My prophecy, half serious and half in jest, was realized. Alas, 
to Russia's sorrow!</p>

<p class="fst">I have set down these lines so that my readers may realize the 
tense and complex internal situation under which Russia entered the War. In 
order that Russia's war drama may be understood, it is necessary to keep in mind 
that the War did not provoke, but merely postponed temporarily, the 
revolutionary movement which had been gathering increasing momentum with 
inexorable stubbornness.</p>

<p class="fst">For the sake of the national defense against an enemy splendidly 
armed and organized, the deep, patriotic instinct of the people dictated to them 
the duty of halting the inner political struggle against Czarism. The people's 
urge for national unity and their desire to lay aside all internal conflicts for 
the time being were indeed remarkable. The entire nation presented a united 
front against the external foe.</p>

<p class="fst">At the moment of the outbreak of the Great War, history presented 
to Russian absolutism what was perhaps the only chance it ever had to gain an 
understanding of the people and to make peace with them in the name of a common 
love for Russia, by uniting around the government all the live, decent and 
honest political forces of the country. But the government deliberately threw 
away this only chance, which, had it been taken advantage of, would have saved 
Russia from dissolution and ruin. The government's reply to the patriotic 
outburst of the people was to redouble the force and pressure of the reaction. 
To save Russia, the Russian people had to fight on two fronts: on the military 
front, almost unarmed and unequipped, they had to resist a powerful enemy armed 
to the teeth, while internally they had to defend themselves against the 
intrigues, corruption and inefficiency of Rasputin's minions, eager to retain 
their power and quite unconcerned about the fate of the country. The 
preservation of absolutism and the cause of successful resistance to the enemy 
stood in tragic contradiction to one another.</p>

<p class="fst">Russia's national consciousness was confronted with a problem of 
tremendous difficulty, a problem which, as future events demonstrated, was 
insoluble. It was necessary to remove from power those who were destroying 
Russia, and at the same time to protect the army and the entire administrative 
apparatus of the state from perturbations which, in time of war, might prove 
fatal.</p>

<p class="fst">I am quite convinced that but for the War the Revolution would 
have come not later than the spring of 1915, perhaps even at the end of 1914. 
The War interrupted the crusade for the liberty and salvation of Russia, and the 
nation&#8212;under a regime already doomed to destruction and under the leadership of 
men like Rasputin, Sukhomlinoff and their ilk&#8212;was obliged to fight an enemy 
excellently equipped and organized.</p>

<p class="fst">In other respects, also, Russia was differently situated from the 
other belligerent powers. She came into the War unprepared and was quite unable 
to make up for her lack of preparedness during the course of the War. With the 
outbreak of the War she was obliged to reorganize her economic and financial 
structure from top to bottom. This reorganization was necessitated by the 
blockade that encircled Russia and by the prohibition of the sale of vodka, 
which had been not only the chief source of state revenue, but one of the chief 
means of promoting trade between town and country, between producer and 
consumer. Much has been said about the blockade of Germany as an instrument of 
her defeat, but few realize that Russia, least equipped of all the great powers 
technically and industrially, suffered even more than Germany from the isolation 
imposed upon her by the War. Germany was cut off from the world but she was able 
to maintain close contact with the nations associated with her. Russia was cut 
off even from her allies. The lack of direct communication made the transport of 
ammunition, machinery and equipment, in any appreciable quantities, impossible. 
It was barely possible to send limited and inadequate shipments through Sweden 
and by way of the Murmansk Railroad, which was opened only in the autumn of 1916 
and never worked well. What little could be sent through Vladivostok, which was 
thousands of miles from the seat of war, was a negligible fraction of what 
Russia needed.</p>

<p class="fst">The world is quite familiar with the effects of the Allied 
blockade on Germany, so that I hardly need emphasize the workings of this 
terrible weapon with regard to Russia. In order to realize what it means for a 
country at war to be cut off from the whole world, one need only imagine what 
would have happened to France if her coasts had been inaccessible to the 
supplies of men and material which came to her in unlimited quantities from all 
corners of the earth.</p>

<p class="fst">"One can compare Russia to a house, the doors and windows of 
which are hermetically sealed and which can be penetrated only by means of its 
chimneys and water pipes," said the representatives of the Inter-Allied Council 
on their visit to Petrograd in February, 1917.</p>

<p class="fst">The second factor in the upheaval in Russia's economic life was 
the prohibition of the sale of vodka on the very first day of the War. I do not 
mean to imply that the state merely lost one-third of its revenue. To make the 
population sober and increase its productivity and individual incomes is worth 
the loss of a billion to the state. But when the peasants stopped drinking they 
began to eat. The consumption of bread increased from fourteen to twenty-one or 
more pouds<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1*]</a> per capita. Meat, 
butter and eggs were consumed by the producers in unheard-of quantities. When 
they could no longer spend their profits on vodka, the peasants not only began 
to eat the produce they had been accustomed to sell, but they started buying 
household necessities and even luxuries. Very soon, however, there was nothing 
left for them to buy, for the supply of goods in the towns was not equal to the 
requirements of a well-to-do and sober peasantry, being adequate only to the 
needs of a poor and drunken class of consumers. It was quite impossible during 
the War to equalize supply and demand. On the contrary, the supply actually 
decreased when factories producing commodities for the internal trade were 
turned exclusively to the production of war and military material. Nor was it 
possible to import goods. When the villagers found that they could spend their 
money neither on vodka nor on household goods they stopped selling produce. 
After hoarding their money for some time (the amount of currency held in the 
villages increased" by six billion rubles in the first years of the War) they 
found that the value of the money had depreciated. Arguing on the simple 
business principle that it was better to hoard grain than depreciating and 
useless money, they determined to keep their grain. To prevent seizure by the 
government, they buried it in pits. I remember how, as early as in 1915, the 
Budget Commission of the Duma was racking its brain on how to extract grain or 
money from the peasants.</p>

<p class="fst">Once mobilized, the army absorbed a large proportion of the 
country's food supply. It consumed as much meat and butter as the entire 
population did before the War. Before the War Russia exported from 400,000,000 
to 600,000,000 pouds of cereals annually, and in the first year of the War the 
government purchased 300,000,000 pouds for the army alone. In 1916 the army 
consumed 1,000,000,000 pouds of cereals, which was only 200,000,000 pouds less 
than Russia had provided for her home and foreign markets before the War.</p>

<p class="fst">The needs of the army and the oversupply in the villages brought 
about an acute crisis in the "granary of Europe"&#8212;a crisis which soon developed 
into a catastrophe. The sobriety and prosperity of the peasant class upset the 
trade of the entire country and resulted in a large shortage of supplies. 
Economic anarchy ensued.</p>

<p class="fst">But there were also other factors in the general economic 
upheaval. The import of coal ceased almost entirely and there was a shortage of 
fuel for the arms and munition factories and for the railways. The Petrograd 
district, the main center of the metallurgical industry, suffered most because 
before the War it had depended almost entirely on foreign coal. Not only did the 
foreign coal disappear but the output of Russia's mines also diminished, owing 
to the improvident mobilization of miners, the lack of mining machinery and 
equipment, the presence of poorly trained and underfed labor and the frequency 
of sporadic, anarchic strikes.</p>

<p class="fst">In short, the economic condition of Russia during the War was in 
itself sufficient to produce a catastrophe. Only the wisest possible utilization 
of the country's resources, the most careful and economical distribution of 
commodities and of the means of production could have made possible the solution 
of the nation's grave economic and financial problems. The entire industrial and 
political life of the country should have been reorganized from the very 
beginning of the War so as to create a real coordination of all the vital 
forces. But instead of a competent government, Russia had at her head Rasputin, 
supported by a clique of criminals, feeble dotards, incompetents and greedy 
adventurers. This government merely utilized the War and the general patriotic 
spirit animating the country as an opportunity for the destruction of all the 
independent institutions of national life. The War became a pretext for men like 
N. Maklakoff, Sukhomlinoff and others for the suppression of the hated movement 
of opposition and revolution, which had the support of fully ninety-five per 
cent of the population. The chieftains of Czarism launched upon a veritable orgy 
of arrogance and violence. All labor organizations and the entire labor press of 
Petrograd were immediately suppressed. Hundreds of thousands of "disloyal" 
citizens were sent to Siberia. Poles, Jews, Finns and other non-Russian 
nationalities were persecuted. Every form of independent initiative, however 
patriotic, was severely discountenanced. The government seemed to be bent on 
killing all the spontaneous life and activity of the country and to carry on the 
War without it. Yet the War called for sustained, heroic effort by the entire 
nation. This was perhaps even more necessary in the rear than at the front, for 
the unprecedented struggle was rather a war of endurance than of swift, decisive 
strokes.</p>

<p class="fst">In those tragic days of the War we revolutionists were branded as 
Utopians for trying to seize upon the patriotic sentiments and good sense of the 
people as a means of accomplishing Russia's emancipation, but it was far more 
naive on the part of our critics to believe that a government of Rasputins, 
Goremykins and Sukhomlinoffs could carry on the War even for a day without 
imperiling the country. Yet at the beginning of the War the upper classes as a 
whole and all the government parties in the Duma believed in the power of the 
government to carry on the struggle, ceasing all opposition and leaving a free 
hand for eighteen months to the incompetents and traitors. While the government 
was committing its blunders and crimes, the upper classes remained blind to 
every ominous sign of impending catastrophe, repeating automatically the absurd 
declaration that "during the War the opposition must cease to oppose." The 
Russia of Rasputin tried to imitate the <i>union sacrée</i> of the parliamentary 
governments of France and England and she paid dearly for the effort.</p>

<p class="fst">Up to the debacle in Galicia, in the spring of 1915, Russia 
silently permitted herself to be sacrificed by the old regime. But if silence 
was excusable in the man in the street, who was kept in ignorance by an iron 
censorship and lulled into a false sense of security by recollections of the 
victories of 1914, it was criminal in the men at the head of affairs who knew 
well what was going on.</p>

<p class="fst">Later the Duma majority began to assail the old regime and 
continued this criticism in the case of the Provisional Government, blaming it 
for the subsequent war disasters. But it showed the most culpable and most 
frivolous neglect of duty when it took no steps to avert these calamities at a 
time when it had the power and the prestige to do so. It saw the high command 
destroying the army, the ministers undermining the economic life of the country, 
provoking infuriated discontent among the people, stifling the popular patriotic 
impulse of the first months of the War and freely sowing the seeds of hatred 
among the subject nationalities of Russia&#8212;and yet it did nothing. There were, 
indeed, a few men who did not permit themselves to be led astray by the
<i>union sacrée</i> of France and England. These men tried to warn the people of 
the approaching calamity. They protested against the criminally irresponsible 
government and endeavored to bring the pressure of public opinion to bear upon 
it. In their anxiety they even tried to fight the government immediately upon 
the outbreak of the War, to save the country from inevitable defeat and anarchy, 
but in vain, for no one paid any heed to them.</p>

<p class="fst">This was how Gutchkoff described the situation before the 
conference of army delegates, held May 12-14, 1917:</p>

<p class="indentb">When the War began, I, like many other people, was filled 
with anxiety and alarm. We felt the catastrophe approaching and we knew that 
there would be no security for the country unless the high command were changed 
and the system of supplying the army completely reorganized. The debacle of 1915 
justified our anxiety. We demanded the dismissal of the commander-in-chief and 
his staff and other drastic reforms. But we did not succeed in having anything 
done. On my visit to the front in August, 1914, after viewing the shattered 
remnants of our two armies defeated at Soldau and studying the system of 
organization of supplies, it already then became clear to me that we were 
hopelessly involved in disaster. Neither the government nor the legislative 
bodies believed me. They merely called my attention to our victories in the 
south, in the Carpathians. I, who had been far from being a man of advanced 
views, became a revolutionist in 1915, for I became firmly convinced that the 
autocracy was leading us to defeat which would have tragic consequences at home, 
and that only the end of the old regime could save the country.</p>

<p class="fst">At a time when Gutchkoff, a conservative who had resolutely 
opposed the Revolution of 1905, but a man of practical intelligence who knew how 
to read the signs of the times, had already become a revolutionist, most of the 
Octobrist and Cadet leaders, after two years of inaction, were barely beginning 
to utter vague criticisms, in the hope of influencing Khvostoff, Maklakoff, 
Goremykin and their like. But already in the autumn of 1914 we "dreamers and 
Utopians" of the Left were demanding a serious program of political and economic 
reforms to deal with the problems of the War. We foretold Russia's inevitable 
shortage of the elementary necessaries of life and pointed out what would be the 
result of the abolition of the sale of vodka. Like Gutchkoff, whose eyes were 
opened in 1915, we repeated again and again from the rostrum of the Duma that 
the old regime would bring Russia to defeat and catastrophe. In January, 1915, I 
pointed out to the Budget Committee of the Duma that the economic disintegration 
of the country was inevitable unless measures were taken immediately to deal 
with the problems of production and distribution, particularly in the rural 
districts.</p>

<p class="fst">The majority of the committee considered my suggestions 
altogether heretical, although a year later it began to put such measures into 
effect. In an address before the Duma I declared to the Czar's ministers: "If 
you have any conscience, if there is any feeling of patriotism left within you, 
resign!" The majority maintained a disgraceful silence, contemplating calmly the 
destructive activities of the government. My voice was a voice crying in the 
wilderness. I was regarded as a defeatist for proclaiming my fear and anxiety 
for the nation. In 1914 and 1915 it was the fashion to condemn all those as 
defeatists, pro-Germans, dreamers and doctrinaires who, foreseeing the 
approaching catastrophe and sensing the abyss opening up before Russia, affirmed 
that it was vain to think of victory while Rasputin was in power. We were 
severely reproached for breaking the "political solidarity" of the country and 
told to stop the insolent persistence of our criticism. But those who could not 
or would not face the truth and who shirked the duty of fighting against the 
forces of disintegration were really the men who unconsciously laid the 
foundations of Russia's inevitable ruin.</p>

<p class="fst">At the very beginning of the War, when the Duma was preparing for 
the historic session of August eighth, Rodzianko sought my opinion, among 
others, as to what proposals he was to lay before the Czar. I advised him to ask 
the Czar to grant an immediate political amnesty, to restore Finland's 
constitution, to proclaim autonomy for Poland, to put a stop to political 
persecution, to grant civil equality and civil liberties. Of course Rodzianko 
did not take my advice. I made the same suggestions to the leaders of the 
Progressive parties, but they curtly upbraided me for my youthful impetuosity 
and pointed out that even in England the parliamentary opposition had ceased to 
oppose the government with the outbreak of the War. What <i>naiveté!</i> The 
British parties rallying around a national, democratic government compared with 
the Duma majority sorrily submitting to the incompetent and criminal Czarist 
government! The practical politicians of England who rallied round the 
government acted from patriotic impulse and made the government pay for their 
support by conceding what they deemed necessary for the national welfare. Our 
"practical" politicians not only failed to perceive the nation's peril and fight 
for essential reforms, but gave the government a free hand in its diabolical 
policy of national destruction.</p>

<p class="fst">All that our wise statesmen accomplished by their naive policy 
was to cut their own throats. Not only the government officials, from whom such 
folly was to have been expected, but even the middle classes represented in the 
Duma, failed to understand that without the voluntary cooperation of all classes 
of the population no country could carry on a war such as was being waged. For a 
whole year before the man in the street awoke to the situation, the economic, 
material and human resources of the nation were being ruthlessly, madly, 
criminally dissipated.</p>

<p class="fst">The Galician defeat, the millions of casualties and the loss of 
the frontier fortresses opened Russia's eyes. The country shuddered with horror 
and indignation, and the government, like an assassin caught in the act, was 
frightened into making certain concessions. It modified slightly its rule of 
terror and gave the middle classes some scope for independent activity, 
particularly in the domain of provisioning the army. The second phase of the War 
began. Independent bodies were permitted to organize the resources of the 
country. At last the Duma ventured to make itself heard. Various organizations 
began to function, through which the middle classes set about the task of 
improving the condition of the army, particularly the supply system, and 
reorganizing the production and distribution of food throughout the country. The 
success achieved by the middle classes in this task was due in no small measure 
to the patriotic support of the working class. Peasants, workmen, cooperative 
societies and local officials were animated by the same patriotic anxiety and 
hastened to the support of the country. The population as a whole was at that 
time remarkably moderate and reasonable, conscious of its duty to the nation.</p>

<p class="fst">Had the Duma, in the autumn of 1915, evinced more self-reliance 
and courage, had it shown better understanding of the people and made common 
cause with all the responsible democratic and progressive forces, it could have 
easily driven from power the internal foe, as an essential prerequisite to the 
defeat of the external enemy.</p>

<p class="fst">In 1915 the country was not yet exhausted economically, the army 
was not yet bled to death and a radical and wholesome change in the government 
might have had very beneficial results. The nation's state of mind was 
essentially sound and by no means war-weary. But the impulse of self-sacrifice 
revealed by the people was permitted to go to waste.</p>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile the effects produced on the country by the debacle of 
1915 had begun to lose their potency and to fade from the public mind. The 
government returned to its old ways and most of the population lost interest. 
Only the privileged class retained a slight measure of independence and relief. 
However, in the autumn of 1915, the various middle-class organizations, such as 
the Union of Municipalities and Zemstvos, managed to get into closer contact 
with the army, helping to reorganize and equip it, establishing friendly 
relations and gaining authority in all the ranks. An alliance between the army 
and the civilian population began to develop, and this alliance eighteen months 
later made the Revolution possible.</p>

<p class="fst">The defeats and sufferings of the army in the retreat of 1915 had 
destroyed the last vestiges of its loyalty to the autocracy and the Romanoff 
dynasty. The nation's efforts in 1915 checked the military debacles by giving 
the army a measure of technical and moral support, but the principal source of 
Russia's peril, the Rasputin regime, still remained, for the entire system and 
administration of the government had been left untouched. As a crumbling edifice 
may be propped up for a while by buttressing it with iron girders and patching 
up the largest cracks, so did the popular movement hold together the 
disintegrating structure of Imperial Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">By the spring of 1916 the condition of the army had so much 
improved that Brusiloff was able to launch his Galician offensive&#8212;which saved 
Italy&#8212;striking against the advice of his superiors, who maintained that the army 
was too demoralized by the retreat of 1915 to undertake offensive operations. 
Brusiloff was unable, however, to follow up his initial brilliant successes 
because of lack of cooperation on the part of the high command and the anarchy 
and disorganization at General Headquarters. The subsequent development of 
Brusiloff's campaign wiped out the early victories and brought new trials and 
tremendous losses. Incidents such as the loss of tens of thousands of lives at 
Kovel may well account for the spirit of utter hopelessness which swept the 
army. The process of final disintegration set in in the autumn of 1916. By 
January of the next year the situation had become really critical.</p>

<p class="fst">Those reactionaries who hold that the Revolution undermined the 
Russian army, that the army, having fought heroically in 1914 and 1915, began in 
1917 to flee in panic, distort the facts completely. The fighting qualities of 
the army diminished inevitably. It became more and more an ill equipped and 
undisciplined rabble, commanded largely by men who had donned their uniforms 
after only six or seven weeks of training, and headed by staff officers who were 
shamefully negligent of their duty. Mutinous and corrupt garrisons in the rear 
formed a dark background to the tragic picture in the winter of 1916. It was not 
without cause that Brusiloff afterwards declared: "The experiences of 1916 
prepared me for the Revolution." Nor was General Alexeyeff, in October, 1916 (at 
that time chief-of-staff to the commander-in-chief, Nicholas II), unjustified 
when, with the approval of Prince Lvoff, he planned to have the Czarina arrested 
and exiled to the Crimea and to compel the Czar to grant certain reforms.</p>

<p class="fst">The situation of the country as a whole was even more desperate 
than that of the army. Rasputin and his clique had thrown off all restraint. 
Their governing methods and their attitude and conduct towards the Russian 
people surpassed all the bounds of audacity and treachery. In the face of the 
growing food, financial, fuel and transport crisis they renewed, with fiendish 
ardor, the persecution of the cooperatives, the Union of Municipalities and 
Zemstvos, the municipal bodies and similar organizations. The censorship 
operated fast and furiously. Newspapers and organizations, however innocent, 
were suppressed. All freedom of assembly was forbidden. An endless stream of 
exiles flowed to Siberia from all parts of Russia. While the ruling clique, 
drunk with blood, was indulging in an orgy of oppression, Russia was perishing. 
Despair, terror and hatred permeated the soul of the people as never before. 
Defeatist and Bolshevist propaganda began to spread in labor circles. Strikes, 
deliberately fomented by the government, became frequent. A wave of riots swept 
the army and the hungry mobs. Desertions increased. Separatist movements sprang 
up in the border provinces. The country was advancing towards a precipice.</p>

<p class="fst">From Grand Dukes to peasants, indignation and wild apprehension 
seized the whole of Russia. Early in November, 1916, Grand Duke Nicholas 
Michaelovitch wrote to the Czar:</p>

<p class="indentb">You have repeatedly affirmed your intention of carrying the 
War to a victorious conclusion. Do you think this is possible in the present 
condition of the country? Do you know the real state of affairs in the border 
provinces and in the interior? Believe me, when I urge you to shake yourself 
from the web in which you are entangled, I do so only because I hope and trust 
that by so doing you may save your throne and our beloved country from 
irretrievable disaster.</p>

<p class="fst">By "web" the Grand Duke meant Alexandra Feodorovna and the 
Rasputin clique.</p>

<p class="fst">Fearing that the folly of Alice, as Alexandra Feodorovna was 
called in the imperial family, would bring ruin upon the entire dynasty, the 
Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovitch took part in the assassination of Rasputin. During 
the winter of 1916 the Duma, although by no means as yet revolutionary, began to 
talk in revolutionary language. In his famous speech Miliukoff openly attacked 
the Stuermer government and asked point blank: "Is this country actually in the 
hands of traitors?" Middle-class Russia raised the demand of a government 
responsible to the Duma. But in this demand, too, the Duma lagged behind. While 
the country as a whole joined in the demand for radical constitutional reforms, 
the Progressive Bloc in the Duma (the majority), led by Miliukoff, Shidloffsky 
and Shulgin, was still clinging to the vague slogan: "A ministry with public 
confidence."</p>

<p class="fst">By December, 1916, a marked difference of opinion had arisen 
between the Duma and those organizations which most resembled it in political 
tone and social status, such as the All-Russian Union of Municipalities and 
Zemstvos.</p>

<p class="quoteb">"In proportion as the country has become aware of the general 
disintegration," said Efremoff, leader of the Progressive party, on February 27, 
1917, "it has lost faith in the government and acquired faith in the Duma. There 
is now, however, an ever increasing tendency to set the Duma aside and solve the 
nation's difficulties in a more radical way. The country will shortly give proof 
of its discontent, and the obstinate shortsightedness of the authorities seems 
determined to drive it to the conclusion that it is impossible to obtain by 
parliamentary means a government responsible to the people."</p>

<p class="fst">The middle classes were losing faith in the Duma, but the more 
democratic and radical circles had never looked to it as an infallible guide, 
though they had tried for months to induce it to join in the struggle for the 
salvation of the country. In November, 1916, the country's peril had become so 
evident that all those who had any spark of patriotism had already become 
revolutionists. In December the whole of Russia was unconsciously adopting 
revolutionary methods against the government. As I said to the Duma majority: 
"Like Molière, who did not know when he was talking prose, you reject revolution 
while you talk and behave like revolutionists." When Stuermer tried to pour oil 
on the troubled waters by announcing the news to the Duma that the Allies had 
agreed to give Constantinople to Russia at the conclusion of the War, even the 
most imperialistically inclined felt uncomfortable at the pompous ministerial 
declaration which had so little relation to the actual state of the country.</p>

<p class="fst">Altogether, the obvious incongruity between Russia's actual 
situation and the interminable repetition by boasting officials of their 
tactless phrasemongery about complete victory over Germany and Russia's 
hereditary mission with regard to Turkey infuriated the exhausted masses.</p>

<p class="fst">The New Year of 1917 found Russia in this state of increasing 
anarchy. A few still cherished gleams of hope that the old government would, at 
the eleventh hour, bethink itself or, at least, perceive its own deadly peril 
and make concessions to the demands of the nation. The Crown, or rather the 
influences behind Alexandra Feodorovna, who had meanwhile openly taken up the 
reins of government, met this hope with a series of new reactionary measures. 
Scheglovitoff, hated by the whole of Russia, was named president of the Imperial 
Council, to which were added also a number of other notorious reactionaries. A 
new ministry was formed, with Protopopoff as its central figure and Golitzin, 
who was himself much surprised at the appointment, as premier. Protopopoff was 
at that time the most hated man in Russia, so that it is not difficult to 
imagine the effect created by his appointment.</p>

<p class="fst">In September, 1916, Protopopoff, a former member and 
ex-vice-president of the Duma, had availed himself of Rasputin's help to work 
his way into the Ministry of the Interior. His appointment, many were convinced, 
was backed by certain financial interests in Rasputin's <i>entourage</i>, with a 
view to ending the War as quickly as possible, even at the price of a separate 
peace. It was upon him that Rasputin's mantle descended after the latter's 
assassination.</p>

<p class="fst">So the authorities answered the country's demand for a popular 
ministry by resorting anew to the instrumentality of the Rasputin clique. Taking 
the bit between its teeth the government rushed, at full speed, towards a 
collision with the people. There was no longer any doubt of its preparing for 
the collision. Strikes were fomented by government agents, and often the 
strikers came to battle with the police. Secret plans were worked out by 
Protopopoff, in cooperation with General Kourloff, one of the most detested 
officials in the police organization, for the "pacification" of Petrograd, plans 
involving wholesale bloodshed.</p>

<p class="fst">The police department was zealously provoking riots among the 
population. Incredible as it may sound, the military censorship, on orders from 
the Ministry of the Interior, prohibited the publication in the Petrograd press 
of the following appeal by the labor section of the War Industrial Committee:</p>

<p class="indentb">Comrades! Workers of Petrograd! We think it our duty to beg 
you to resume your work immediately. Labor, conscious of its responsibilities at 
this moment, must not weaken its forces by such strikes. In the interests of the 
working class you must return to your factories.</p>

<p class="fst">In spite of the fact that there was a great strike in progress in 
the munition factories, the publication of this appeal was forbidden.</p>

<p class="fst">With diabolical persistency the police department, led by 
Kourloff, set itself to destroying all democratic organizations that stood for 
national defense and to push the masses into the arms of defeatist-Bolshevist 
agitators, who were assiduously spreading their propaganda among the aroused 
workers and soldiers. In January, almost the entire labor group of the Central 
War Industrial Committee was arrested. This group was the stronghold of national 
defense in the world of labor and was bitterly assailed by the Bolsheviki and 
defeatists. At the same time the government began the demobilization of the 
labor sections of the provincial War Industrial Committees. A conference in 
Moscow of various independent organizations called to consider the food problem 
was forbidden, although many cities and towns were on the verge of starvation. 
Even a commercial and financial conference summoned in Moscow was suppressed. 
The central body of the cooperative societies, which were supplying the army and 
the cities with food, was dissolved and its members prosecuted.</p>

<p class="fst">In a word, the government set itself to demolishing everything 
that was likely to avert an uprising, meanwhile laying plans for the suppression 
of rioting in Petrograd with machine guns. The motto attributed to the Ministry 
of the Interior&#8212;"through anarchy to a separate peace"&#8212;was being successfully put 
into effect.</p>

<p class="fst">I must say, however, that Nicholas II had nothing to do with all 
this. The government was simply preparing to confront him at a given moment with 
a
<i>fait accompli</i> which would oblige him to sign a separate peace. I cannot 
say whether Alexandra Feodorovna had anything to do with it. Her immediate 
circle was not above suspicion and German agents were hovering around her and 
Madame Vyroubova. But whether the Czarina and her lady-in-waiting took part in 
preparing the country for a separate peace I cannot say, although I did my best 
to find out when I first took office.</p>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile the condition of the army was becoming desperate. By 
January, 1917, there had been 1,200,000 desertions and the number was still 
increasing. The army was demobilizing itself. The high command was helpless to 
stem this tide for home. Special military police detachments were formed to 
round up the deserters and rewards of from seven to twenty-five copecks a head 
(according to the rank of the deserter) were offered as encouragement in the man 
hunt.</p>

<p class="fst">The Naval and Military Committee of the Duma was at its wit's end 
to find a means of preventing the army from melting away. Military discipline 
began to vanish. Whole units refused to fight or to relieve their comrades in 
the trenches. Here and there the men in the trenches engaged in and encouraged 
fraternization with the Germans. The lack of military discipline in the rear was 
even worse. A memorandum dealing with the tragic condition in the army and the 
urgent need for certain measures to cope with it, drawn up by a special 
conference on defense consisting of representatives of the Duma, the Imperial 
Council and independent organizations, was laid before the Czar at the end of 
January. Shingarioff, Chairman of the Military and Naval Affairs Committee of 
the Duma, obtained an audience with the Czar in a naive effort to prevail upon 
him to take measures to save the country.</p>

<p class="fst">The condition of the country as a whole continued to be worse 
than that of the army. Owing to the coal shortage, the blast furnaces in the 
south came to a standstill in December and the munition factories in Petrograd 
began closing down. In February came an acute crisis in the textile industries 
of Moscow, which used a very large proportion of the coal required by the 
country. The transportation system was becoming more and more disorganized. 
Passenger traffic had to be stopped for weeks at a time to enable the most 
essential military and supply trains to go through to the front. In Vladivostok 
alone there were 40,000,000 pouds of military supplies and agricultural material 
which it was quite impossible to transport into Russia. The last war loan had 
brought almost nothing. In January and February, 1917, 995,000,000 paper rubles 
were issued as against 662,800,000 for the first half of 1916. The cost of the 
War exceeded 50,000,000 rubles a day.</p>

<p class="fst">At the end of January the Central Committee of the All-Russian 
Union of Municipalities and Zemstvos presented a memorandum to the Government 
Food Commission which contained the following observation:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"The towns received only one-fiftieth and one-eighteenth of 
the supplies allotted to them, respectively, for November and December, 1916. 
All stores in the towns are exhausted. By February there will be no bread."</p>

<p class="fst">And, indeed, there was no more bread in the towns by February. 
There were hunger riots in all the provinces. On February tenth, what the 
authorities called a "misunderstanding" due to "food shortage" occurred in 
Petrograd. The working classes had been provoked by hunger into the riots which 
were to justify the government in concluding a separate peace.</p>

<p class="fst">From this time on it became impossible to stem the inevitable 
development of events into revolution. The time for a coup d'état, for a quiet 
revolution from above, had passed. Not without reason did Basil Maklakoff 
declare on May 17, 1917, before a conference of Duma deputies:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"At a certain moment it became clear to us that it would be 
impossible to carry the War to a successful conclusion while the old regime was 
in power, and it became the duty for those who feared the consequences of an 
upheaval to save the country from revolution from below by revolution from 
above. That was the duty we failed to fulfill. If our children should come to 
curse this Revolution they will also curse those who did not know in time how to 
prevent it."</p>

<p class="fst">There had been but one means of saving the country from 
revolution and consequent anarchy, and that was by liberating it by a swift and 
energetic stroke from the government which was destroying it, as a center of 
infection is cut out of a healthy body.</p>

<p class="fst">Those who were in closest touch with the masses realized most 
clearly the danger of an anarchic revolution. That was why the interparty group, 
to which I belonged, so persistently demanded radical reconstruction of the 
government and did its best to speed it. Beginning with the autumn of 1916 
preparations for a coup d'état were launched in various circles. A number of 
organizations and even members of the Progressive Bloc in the Duma took part in 
the conspiracies. The conspirators were in touch with army circles, and some 
generals, not to mention junior officers, were drawn into the plans. There were 
a number of plots under way and the plans were discussed by the respective 
conspiratory groups at secret meetings in Moscow and Petrograd. One plan 
provided for the arrest of the Empress and her entire circle, followed by a 
demand for the Czar's abdication in favor of his young son, under the regency of 
Michael Alexandrovitch.</p>

<p class="fst">Some of these plans were ready for execution in the winter of 
1916, and those initiated into the conspiracies were looking forward with 
impatience to their realization. Our interparty group, consisting of 
representatives of all Left elements in the Duma, was in touch with all active 
radical forces in the country and through our agents we sought to develop a 
common program and prevent disagreements which might interfere with the proposed 
coup d'état. This was made necessary because many revolutionary centers were not 
familiar with the ends for which other groups were working. Besides helping to 
facilitate a coup d'état we had to prepare all democratic and socialist parties 
for the event and to create a center around which to rally the revolutionary 
democracy as a controlling force against popular excesses. The secret 
information bureau of the democratic parties provided such a center.</p>

<p class="fst">As far as I knew of and participated in the plans for a coup 
d'état, that was how the situation stood in Petrograd and Moscow. There were, 
however, additional projects of the same kind at the front and elsewhere. For 
instance, one group of army officers planned to bomb the Czar's automobile from 
an aeroplane at a certain spot along the front.</p>

<p class="fst">Unfortunately none of the plans for a coup d'état was carried 
out. The men upon whom the realization of these plans depended were held back by 
their old traditions of loyalty to the throne and the imperial family. They kept 
on vacillating and tinkering with the plans, trying to define the powers of the 
regent, etc., and putting off the decisive moment. But every day's delay 
endangered the whole enterprise by exposing it more and more to discovery by the 
police. Several opportune moments had already been permitted to pass.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, the coup d'état was fixed by one group for the beginning 
of March. But it was too late.</p>

<p class="fst">On February twenty-seventh the Duma began what was to be its last 
session. A great popular demonstration was expected on that day. Police and 
troops lined the streets leading to the Tauride Palace. There was a strong 
movement among the workers for marching to the support of the Duma, but the Duma 
majority, through Miliukoff's open letter to the workers, firmly and even rudely 
declined this help, asking the workers to take no action. (The government 
censorship, by the way, tried to stop publication of this letter.) The session 
began in an atmosphere of great tension. The majority, although realizing that 
critical events were impending, refused to admit that the time for conciliation 
with the government had passed, and that the people were about to take matters 
into their own hands. It still obstinately refused, in its all too moderate 
declaration of policy, to join in the demand of the whole middle class for a 
ministry responsible to the Duma.</p>

<p class="fst">This declaration was altogether in dissonance with the actual 
situation and with the opinion of the whole country. Yet the leaders of the 
majority regarded the original draft of this declaration, as drawn by Shulgin, 
too radical. Even those progressives who bolted the Progressive Bloc to join the 
Left believed that a solution consistent with loyalty to the Czar was still 
possible, although they declared in their pronouncement that the country was "on 
the eve of demonstrating its discontent." On the same day (February 
twenty-seventh) Miliukoff declared in the Duma: "Only heroic measures can cure 
the helplessness that has descended upon the country as the result of the wall 
which the government has built around itself and which during the last three 
months has become even more impenetrable." He added: "We have reached a decisive 
point. On all sides we see patriotic anxiety. Only timely conciliation can bring 
salvation. The Duma alone cannot remove this anxiety, but we believe that the 
patriotism of the people will not allow our powers of defense to be weakened at 
this critical moment."</p>

<p class="fst">On the following day I addressed the Duma and for the first time 
the Duma heard the unvarnished truth. I declared openly that the ruin of the 
country was due not to ministers who come and go but to the power which appoints 
them,
<i>i.e.</i>, the monarch and the dynasty. I called upon the Duma to begin at 
once, by every available means, a fight to the bitter end against these enemies 
of the people. I implored the Duma, in the name of the highest duty of 
citizenship, to take action immediately and to risk everything for the salvation 
of the country. I concluded by saying:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"If you refuse to listen to my warnings, you will meet facts 
instead of warnings. Look at the strokes of lightning already flashing across 
the sky." I declared that I for one would not shrink from violence.</p>

<p class="fst">A few days later I said: "In my opinion an open collision with 
the authorities is bound to come soon."</p>

<p class="fst">But very few realized the catastrophe was approaching and most 
people listened to my warnings with incredulity. I remember that after my first 
address many people condoled with me, fearing the consequences that would befall 
me as a result of my attack on the dynasty. Most people thought we were on the 
verge not of a revolution but of a bitter and hopeless reaction. The police 
department was still very effective in its operations and every day the papers 
carried statements "forbidden by the censorship" in the columns allotted to the 
publication of speeches in the Duma. Even Pourischkevitch, the reactionary 
deputy, protested against the mutilation and falsification of his speeches by 
the military censorship. The number of arrests and house searches increased. The 
police and troops were successfully putting down the growing riots in the 
capital. On March fifth there was serious rioting in the largest factories in 
Petrograd, including the Putiloff works. The troops obeyed orders to resist the 
workers.</p>

<p class="fst">On the same day the Czar left for General Headquarters, leaving 
behind with Prince Golitzin a decree for dissolution of the Duma, signed but 
undated, "ready for possible contingencies." The fate of the Duma was thus left 
entirely in the hands of Protopopoff and his clique. On February sixth the 
rioting assumed new intensity and the attitude of the government was such as to 
provoke Shingarioff, speaking in the Duma, to denounce the existing regime as "a 
dictatorship of madness."</p>

<p class="fst">The moment of collision approached more quickly than I thought. 
On March ninth all the newspapers of Petrograd ceased publication simultaneously 
with a general strike in almost all the factories. Here and there were battles 
between the throngs and the armed forces of the government. The acute food 
shortage in the capital finally compelled Prince Golitzin to make concessions. A 
special conference composed of members of the government (Protopopoff was not 
permitted to participate) and of representatives of the Duma and Imperial 
Council resolved to pass a law transferring the control of the food supply to 
the town councils within twenty-four hours. The Duma passed this law at its 
morning session, March tenth, which was its last.</p>

<p class="fst">There was firing that day all over the capital. A crowd was shot 
down on the Nevsky Prospekt, quite near the Duma. The troops were still obeying 
orders. There was also fighting on the Znamensky Square and in other parts of 
the city. In the evening the Pavlovsk Regiment mutinied, but was immediately 
suppressed, the ringleaders being taken to the Fortress of SS. Peter and Paul.</p>

<p class="fst">During these days conferences were going on in the Duma 
continuously from morning till night. The majority was still hopelessly trying 
to find a "loyal" way out of the situation.</p>

<p class="fst">On March ninth the whole city was transformed into a military 
camp. At midday all bridges were barricaded and it became difficult to get into 
the center of the city from the suburbs. The Constitutional Democrats (Cadets) 
and the Laborites insisted that the session of the Duma, fixed for March 
twelfth, be held on the eleventh. We felt that it was essential to have an 
All-Russian political center in these days. But most parties disagreed with us 
and we compromised by calling a meeting of the leaders for midday and the Duma 
session for 2 P.M. on March twelfth. At midnight, on March eleventh, Rodzianko 
received the Czar's decree of dissolution, which set no date for the 
reconvocation of the Duma. This last act of the "dictatorship of madness" turned 
the hunger riots into the Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">"It takes a thunderbolt to make a muzhik cross himself," says an 
old Russian proverb. The action of the government in dissolving the Duma when 
confronted by the hungry, maddened throng struck Russia like a thunderbolt and 
opened her eyes to the abyss towards which the madmen and traitors of Czarism 
were pushing her. But for the Duma there could have been no revolution. Neither 
could it have come about without the revolt of the workers and soldiers. At the 
first meeting of the Cadet party after the Revolution, Miliukoff said: "We must 
bow to those bodies we have seen lying in red coffins on the Field of Mars."</p>

<p class="fst">When we left the Tauride Palace on the evening of March eleventh 
we did not yet know that the Duma was to be dissolved. The mutiny of the 
Pavlovsk Regiment on March tenth was not supported by the rest of the garrison. 
The crowds in the streets seemed to be dispersing and calming down that evening. 
It looked as if the disturbances were drawing to an end. That is why the crash 
on March twelfth came as a surprise.</p>

<p class="fst">I have given a brief summary of the events which led up to the 
Revolution. The Revolution did not create the anarchy in Russia, but was in fact 
the healthy effort of the country to save itself from the approaching 
disintegration. The criminal folly of the government and the war exhaustion 
brought Russia to the Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The Revolution succeeded in abolishing the autocracy, but it 
could not remove the exhaustion of the country, for one of its main duties was 
to carry on the War. It had decided to put the utmost strain upon the country's 
resources. Herein lay the tragedy of the Revolution and of the Russian people. 
Some day the world will learn to understand in its proper light the <i>via 
crucis</i> Russia walked in 1916-17 and is, indeed, still walking. I am quite 
convinced that the Revolution alone kept the Russian army at the front until the 
autumn of 1917, that it alone made it possible for the United States to come 
into the War, that the Revolution alone made the defeat of Hohenzollern Germany 
possible.</p>

<p class="fst">The years 1917-27 have shown that centuries of autocracy cannot 
fail to leave their marks on a country. The body politic was corrupt long before 
the Revolution. The state, built on the sweat and blood and tears of the people, 
had long been disintegrated and the soul of the people poisoned by the old 
regime. Russia ground down by the autocracy was like a slave rotting in a foul 
dungeon without light or air. By straining every nerve she found strength to 
break her fetters and prison bars, and to escape from her suffocating captivity 
to freedom.</p>

<p class="fst">But I hear sad and angry voices objecting: "What was the use of 
breaking out of prison only to collapse upon the threshold?" To these I would 
reply:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Wait! Russia has not fallen dead. The fight has only just 
begun."</p>
