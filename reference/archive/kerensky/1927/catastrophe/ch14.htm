<h2><a name="h1">CHAPTER XIV</a><br>
<small>THE CONSPIRATORS ON THE RIGHT</small></h2>

<p class="fst">THE mad mutiny of the commander-in-chief, which opened the doors 
to the Kremlin for the Bolsheviki and to Brest-Litovsk for Ludendorff, was the 
final link in the conspiracies of the Right against the Provisional Government. 
Public opinion abroad has been inclined to regard the Korniloff movement as an 
almost unexpected outburst of incensed patriotism on the part of Korniloff and 
his supporters. In accordance with the picture portraying Russian history 
between March and November, 1917, as a process of gradual and increasing 
disintegration, Sovietization and Bolshevization of the state, the revolt of 
General Korniloff is presented as the heroic act of a self-sacrificing patriot, 
striving in vain to free Russia from a "weak-willed" government and to save his 
perishing country on the very brink of the precipice. I hope that what I have 
presented thus far has conveyed to the reader's mind a somewhat different 
picture, a picture of reality as against pure legend.</p>

<p class="fst">There was nothing sudden in the action of the people who prepared 
the conspiracy of the commander-in-chief against the government which had 
entrusted the army into his hands in the most critical months of the War. On the 
contrary, the conspiracy developed slowly, systematically, with cool calculation 
of all the factors involved affecting its possible success or failure. Nor was 
the motive of the conspiracy, so far as some of its backers were concerned, one 
of unselfish patriotism. On the contrary, the motive was extremely selfish&#8212;to be 
sure, not one of personal but of class selfishness. To avoid misunderstanding I 
want to append right here one qualification: in describing the motives of the 
criminal activity of the initiators and original leaders of the conspiracy I do 
not attribute these selfish class motives to General Korniloff and his close 
military supporters, all of whom were brave Russian patriots, who were drawn 
into the conspiracy after the preparatory work had been completed.</p>

<p class="fst">The idea of the overthrow of the Provisional Government by means 
of a conspiracy against it appeared in Petrograd for the first time early in 
May, 1917, and perhaps even earlier, in a limited circle of bankers and 
financiers. The date alone shows that what was being contemplated was not a 
struggle against the "excesses" of the Revolution and "Kerensky's weak-willed 
government," but against the Revolution itself, against the new order in Russia. 
The details of the conspiratory work of this original group of reactionaries are 
little known. I know only that steps were taken for the creation of a fund, for 
which purpose the conspirators entered into contact with certain political 
figures. At the same time they undertook to make some soundings in military 
circles. The man placed in charge of the preliminary work and of finding ways 
and means for the execution of the conspiracy was a certain Zavoiko. I do not 
know whether he acted as a full-fledged member of the conspiracy or merely as an 
agent.</p>

<p class="fst">The disintegration of the army, having reached its most critical 
point with Gutchkoff's departure from the cabinet, created for the civilian 
prophets of military dictatorship a favorable condition in the attitude of the 
officers. On May twentieth, in Mohileff, at the headquarters of the 
Commander-in-Chief, General Alexeyeff, was convened the first conference of 
officers, which led to the formation of the Union of Officers, an organization 
which gained much influence in circles close to the General Staff.</p>

<p class="fst">The connecting link at General Headquarters between the civilian 
and military organizers of the conspiracy was Colonel L. Novosiltzeff, a reserve 
officer called into service during the War, and President of the Union of 
Officers. He was an experienced zemstvo and political worker, a member of the 
Central Committee of the Constitutional-Democratic party, who had been elected 
to a seat in the fourth Duma but had resigned from it shortly afterwards. 
Novosiltzeff belonged to the Right wing of the Constitutional-Democratic party 
and by his origin and social interests was connected with the landed 
aristocracy. Colonel Novosiltzeff made regular trips between General 
Headquarters and Moscow. Because of his political and social position he was 
extremely valuable to the conspiracy. At the beginning of June (<i>i.e.</i>, 
previous to our military offensive and while Prince Lvoff was still the premier) 
the conspiracy stood as follows:</p>

<p class="fst">At the front individual emissaries of the Central Committee of 
the Union of Officers were carefully enlisting supporters in the active army. 
Incidentally, the heads of the conspiracy at General Headquarters were very much 
incensed by the removal of General Alexeyeff and the appointment of General 
Brusiloff in his place, as commander-in-chief, for General Alexeyeff, from the 
very beginning, was cognizant of the work of Novosiltzeff and his close 
associates, and was helping them by his advice and connections in the two 
capitals. General Alexeyeff, the first one to be mentioned as candidate for 
dictator, declined from the very beginning to play any such active role. After 
the break between Admiral Kolchak and the Black Sea Fleet, the admiral was 
brought forward as the candidate. But nothing came of this either, and when 
Admiral Kolchak went to the United States on a special mission for the 
Provisional Government, the search for a general on a white horse continued.</p>

<p class="fst">Up until the July uprising of the Bolsheviki the government's 
attention was concentrated on the Left, from which alone, it seemed, there was 
danger of new perturbations. I think that the conspirators themselves had scant 
hope of success. I repeat, moreover, that they had not yet found the "hero," 
that very same general on a white horse who is so essential for a classic
<i>pronunciamento</i>. Finally, the conspirators themselves were not as yet 
sufficiently united and organized. And, what was most important, there was not 
as yet that general social-psychological atmosphere necessary to their 
enterprise. The financiers, staff officers and those politicians of Petrograd 
and Moscow who were swept aside by the fall of the monarchy were merely 
"gathering forces slowly" for "eventualities," to be used "in case of need," 
while Zavoiko, their messenger at the front, who had built himself a nest close 
to Korniloff, was not as yet giving tangible evidence of his work.</p>

<h4>THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PREPARATION FOR THE COUP</h4>

<p class="fst">The psychologic prerequisites for serious development of the 
military conspiracy appeared only after the July uprising of the Bolsheviki and 
the beginning, on July nineteenth, of the retreat of our armies from Galicia. 
The beginning of the new retreat of the Russian armies, accompanied by the usual 
horrors of such an operation, by panic and demoralization, aggravated acutely 
the general feeling of injured patriotism in all army circles, affecting equally 
the high command, the government commissars and the army committees.</p>

<p class="fst">I have already emphasized that the fundamental strategic 
significance of the campaign of 1917 on the Russian Front was in the restoration 
of military operations and the return of German divisions to our front. The 
decisive strategic consequences of the restoration of active operations by the 
Russian army could not in any way be minimized by our retreat, however painful 
was its effect psychologically on the nation's patriotism. This simple military 
truism should, of course, have been clear to such men as General Alexeyeff or 
General Denikin. Moreover, as we of the Provisional Government knew, they knew 
well that the situation in the Austro-German trenches was by no means in order. 
They knew that the plan of a crushing offensive in the direction of Kieff and 
Odessa, conceived by Ludendorff, had completely failed, because of the 
disorganization of the Austrian army. But these cold considerations were not 
comprehensible to the mind of the broad masses of the people and the troops; 
they experienced most painfully only the outer pictures of our new military 
failure, to which the revelations of Lenin's cooperation with Ludendorff lent a 
particular acute touch.</p>

<p class="fst">At midnight on July twentieth, I received the first telegram 
telling of the enemy's break through the Russian lines in the direction of 
Tarnopol. On July twenty-first to twenty-second, this break developed into a 
determined offensive, in the course of which our troops, failing to show proper 
resistance in the mass and, in places, failing to obey orders, were retreating 
with increasing speed. On the Western Front of General Denikin, the operation 
begun at Krevo ended without result on July twenty-third, due to our inability 
to develop our initial success because of the unreliability and moral weakness 
of some of our units.</p>

<p class="fst">In the autumn of 1914 the armies of Samsonoff and Rennenkampf in 
East Prussia had been not only smashed but virtually destroyed as lighting 
units. In 1915 the Russian troops had been swept from the Carpathian heights and 
Przemysl in Western Galicia and rolled back almost to the Russian frontier. With 
equally astounding rapidity the Russian army in the same year had lost Warsaw 
and the entire Polish line of fortresses. But then those terrific defeats were 
being reported only through curt, dry <i>communiqués</i> from the General 
Headquarters of the Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevitch, while the commanding 
corps, indignant and resentful, either kept a severe silence or was compelled to 
feign an official optimism. The nation, held within the grasp of military 
censorship, had been fed on only vague rumors and, suffering in stifled misery, 
had been unable to do anything for the army.</p>

<p class="fst">Now exactly the opposite was the case. With the very first German 
blow the entire country emitted a cry of pain. And first to speak of its travail 
was the army itself, at times too loudly and in tones of exaggerated 
apprehension. On July twenty-second, the third day of the Tarnopol break, when 
General Brusiloff was still commander-in-chief, the Provisional Government, the 
All-Russian Committee of Soviets and the Executive Committee of the Peasant 
Congress received simultaneously a telegram signed by the Army Committee of the 
Southwestern Front and the committee and commissar of the eleventh army, against 
which the enemy attack was directed. I will quote the telegram, because it 
illustrates well what I am trying to describe:</p>

<p class="fst">The offensive begun by the Germans on July nineteenth is 
developing into an immeasurable disaster. The morale of the units moved recently 
into action by the heroic efforts of a conscious minority has undergone a fatal 
change. The fighting spirit has been quickly exhausted. Most units are in a 
state of increasing disintegration. Persuasion and argument have lost their 
power. They provoke only threats and even shooting. Some units desert their 
positions without waiting even for the approach of the enemy. There have been 
cases when orders for immediate advance to the assistance of hard-pressed units 
were discussed for hours at meetings. Positions are not infrequently being 
deserted at the very first shot of the enemy. Long columns of deserters, with 
and without rifles, are moving along a line hundreds of versts long, without any 
consciousness of possible punishment. At times whole units desert in this 
manner. In the unanimous opinion of the commissars the situation demands the 
most extreme measures and effort, for we must stop at nothing to save the 
Revolution from perishing. To-day the commander-in-chief of the Southwestern 
front [General Korniloff, just appointed by me to this post&#8212;A. K.] and the 
commander of the eleventh army, with the approval of the commissars and 
committees, issued orders to open fire on those who flee from positions. Let the 
entire country know the whole truth of the situation here. Let it rouse itself 
and find the strength and determination to crush mercilessly all those who by 
their weakness are destroying and betraying the Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The army committees who signed this significant telegram were all 
composed of members of Socialist parties and some of those men had but recently 
returned from hard labor in Siberia, following the amnesty proclaimed by the 
Provisional Government.</p>

<p class="fst">Similar telegrams were received by us in Petrograd from all 
sections of the front. The country's immediate reply to this call of woe was a 
mighty determination to overcome the disintegration. The Soviets, city councils 
and similar organizations began to speak in a new language, summoning the nation 
to new and unyielding effort to save the Revolution and the state.</p>

<p class="fst">Active operations are absolutely essential as a curative measure 
for the restoration of the fighting capacity of a weary, shattered army, but 
such curative measures have a violent and, therefore, dangerous reaction. As an 
example we may recall the French experience three months before our own July 
offensive. I refer to the unsuccessful offensive under General Nivelle, which 
ended in disastrous failure and immediate mutiny in the army. This, it will be 
remembered, occurred in a country unshattered by any revolutionary upheavals and 
with a firm political organism.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1*]</a> 
After the War, Painleve himself, minister of war at the time of the Nivelle 
disaster, told of the critical night when he learned that one division was 
preparing to march on Paris. It was only three months after the Austro-German 
break at Tarnopol when not only the Austrian armies themselves were in a state 
of complete disintegration but Germany herself began giving indications of 
collapse, with the first serious disorders in the Kaiser's fleet.</p>

<p class="fst">In Russia, in the fourth year of the war, the manifestations of 
weariness in the army took place under circumstances of the very greatest 
difficulty and in the wake of the most profound political, social, economic and 
psychologic disturbances.</p>

<p class="fst">Concluding my references to the situation at the front, following 
the German counter-offensive, I will say here that the rapid retreat begun by 
the Russian armies on July nineteenth was not of long duration. The new 
psychology of the nation, the revived wave of patriotism and the unforgetable 
self-sacrifice of the commanding corps performed a miracle. On July thirtieth I 
received a telegram from the commissar of the Northern Front stating that after 
the loss of the suburban fortifications at Iskul "the morale of the rank and 
file was undergoing a sharp change for the better, with the approach of the 
troops to the home frontier." And on August ninth followed a report from General 
Beliayeff, commander of the Galician (Southwestern) Front, to the effect that 
the retreat had definitely been halted and the position of the army 
consolidated. General Korniloff himself, the new commander-in-chief, in making 
his first report to the Provisional Government, on August fifteenth, presented 
an encouraging picture of the general situation at the front, expressing his 
intention of resuming offensive operations in Galicia in the near future.</p>

<p class="fst">I have devoted so much space to a description of the acutely 
patriotic and extremely tense reactions experienced by Russia in July-August, 
1917, in order to make clear to the reader the whole work of the supporters of 
the contemplated military revolt in the psychological preparation of their 
attack on the government.</p>

<p class="fst">This preparation consisted: 1, in deliberate exaggeration of the 
difficulties at the front and of the very great sufferings experienced by the 
army; 2, in demanding from the government demagogic measures, obviously 
unenforcible, for the restoration of discipline; 3, in vilifying all democratic 
organizations in the army; and 4, in waging an open press campaign in behalf of 
General Korniloff as the "only possible savior of Russia." This demagogic 
campaign of arousing in certain circles a feeling of patriotic indignation did 
not abate but, on the contrary, increased with the improvement at the front. 
And, indeed, under the prevailing patriotic sentiment animating the entire 
country, this play on the painful emotions of injured patriotism gained 
excellent results for the conspirators. By the middle of August both capitals 
were sufficiently filled with various conspiratory organizations, military and 
civilian, while the practical preparations for a coup d'état in the name of the 
military dictatorship of General Korniloff proceeded apace.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1*]</a> In general, it may be said that the entire development of the summer 
campaign of 1917 would have taken a different course if there had been 
cooperation among the Allies (England, France, and Russia). For example, the 
Nivelle offensive would have in all probability been successful if it had been 
timed with ours, and if the British command had supported us.&#8212;A. K.</p>
