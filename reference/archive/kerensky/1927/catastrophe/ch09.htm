<h2><a name="h1">CHAPTER IX</a><br>
<small>THE OFFENSIVE ITS INEVITABILITY</small></h2>

<p class="fst">WE no longer find to-day the unanimity of opinion concerning our 
offensive of July, 1917, that prevailed then both in Russia and among the 
Allies. Due apparently to a misconception, some even consider that offensive as 
the last blow that killed the Russian army. Others believe that the operation 
was determined not by the interests of Russian but was "dictated" to us by our 
Allies. A third group is inclined to see in it a particular manifestation of 
"light-headedness" and irresponsibility on the part of the government in having 
permitted itself to be carried away by love of rhetoric.</p>

<p class="fst">The last opinion deserves no reply. The fact is that the 
resumption of active operations by the Russian army after two months of 
paralysis was dictated absolutely by the inner development of events in Russia. 
To be sure, the representatives of the Allies insisted on the execution by 
Russia, at least in part, of the strategic plan adopted at the Inter-Allied 
conference in Petrograd, in February, 1917. But the insistence of the Allies 
would have been of no avail if the necessity for the offensive had not been 
dictated by our own political considerations. The insistence of the Allies 
(France and England) played no part, if only because they no longer considered 
themselves bound by any obligations to Russia after the Revolution. As I have 
already said, the German General Staff having stopped, according to plan, all 
active operations on the Russian Front, there ensued a condition of virtual 
armistice. It was the plan of the German High Command that this armistice be 
followed by a separate peace and the exit of Russia from the War. Berlin's 
efforts to come to a direct agreement with Russia were begun as early as April. 
Of course, these efforts failed to make any impression on the Provisional 
Government and the whole Russian democracy, which were determined on peace as 
quickly as possible, but a general, not a separate peace. Von Bethmann-Hollweg, 
or, rather, Ludendorff, did not, however, lose hope of achieving Germany's 
purpose. They directed their attention upon the Soviet circles.</p>

<p class="fst">About the middle of June there appeared in Petrograd, among other 
foreign socialists who were paying frequent visits to Russia, one of the leaders 
of the Swiss Social-Democratic party. His name was Grimm. Despite his definite 
anti-Allied attitude, the Provisional Government permitted him to enter Russia 
on guaranties given by certain leaders of the Soviet who maintained a strong 
attitude in favor of continuing Russia's defense. However, on his arrival in 
Petrograd, Grimm immediately launched a propaganda along pro-German lines. Soon 
after we intercepted a letter addressed to Grimm by Hoffman, of the Swiss 
Federal Council, which, by way of instruction to Grimm, declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Germany will undertake no offensive on the Eastern Front as 
long as there remains a possibility of agreement with Russia."</p>

<p class="fst">Thus it was not possible to rely upon a new blow from Germany 
that would definitely bring the Russian democracy, dreaming of peace, to the 
realization of the bitter facts of the situation. It was necessary to make a 
choice&#8212;to accept the consequences of the virtual demobilization of the Russian 
army and capitulate to Germany, or to assume the initiative in military 
operations. Having rejected the idea of a separate peace, which is always a 
misfortune for the country concluding it, the return to new action became 
unavoidable. For no army can remain in indefinite idleness. An army may not 
always be in a position to fight, but the expectancy, at all times, of impending 
action constitutes the fundamental condition of its existence. To say to an army 
in the midst of war that under no circumstances would it be compelled to fight 
is tantamount to transforming the troops into a meaningless mob, useless, 
restless, irritable and, therefore, capable of all sorts of excesses. For this 
reason and to preserve the interior of the country from the grave wave of 
anarchy threatening from the front it was incumbent upon us, before embarking 
upon the main problem of army reorganization and systemtaic reduction and 
readjustment of its regular formations, to make of it once more an army, <i>i.e.</i>, 
to bring it back to the psychology of action, or of impending action.</p>

<p class="fst">The Russian army was, of course, no longer capable of carrying 
out in any measure the plan of a general offensive worked out in January. If 
during the three years preceding the Revolution the Russian troops failed to win 
a single decisive victory over the German armies (only on the Austro-Galician 
and the Caucasus fronts were there any victories), it was quite futile to think 
of victory now, in the summer of 1917.</p>

<p class="fst">But a victory was not necessary! As President Wilson declared 
categorically before Congress, it was the Russian Revolution which made it 
possible for America to enter the War and thus alter fundamentally the ratio of 
the contending forces In the War. As late as January, 1917, the war situation 
made it imperative for Russia and her Allies to bend all their energies to bring 
the War to an end by the autumn of 1917. But in the summer of 1917 it became 
necessary only to keep going until the arrival of the American army on the 
Western Front, with all its tremendous resources. This general Allied task 
expressed itself, so far as Russia was concerned, in a new strategic aim: we 
were no longer required to engage in a general offensive, but to compel the 
Germans to keep as many divisions as possible on the Russian Front until the 
conclusion of the campaign of 1917, <i>i.e.</i>, until the autumn. As I will 
show later, this task was carried out in full by the Russian Revolution, and all 
the contentions of English and French politicians to the effect that not only 
the Bolsheviki but also the Provisional Government and Russia In general failed 
to carry out Russia's obligations to the Allied Governments, and thus delivered 
a blow to the Allied cause, are either a grave mistake or a conscious 
falsification of the facts, in contradiction with all conceptions of honesty and 
honor in international relations.</p>

<p class="fst">In general, the Allies throughout the existence of the 
Provisional Government&#8212;towards which they maintained a critical attitude&#8212;failed 
to understand that the material weakening of Russia, after the fall of the 
monarchy, was compensated in full measure by the effect of the Russian 
Revolution on the internal situation in Germany, Austria, Bulgaria and Turkey.</p>

<p class="fst">The most important effect of the Russian Revolution, in my 
opinion, was the fundamental change in the attitude and sentiment of Austria's 
Slav population, as well as the sharp change in the orientation of Pilsudsky's 
Polish legions, which up until the moment of the Russian Revolution were 
fighting in the ranks of the Austro-Hungarian army against Russia and her</p>

<p class="fst">Allies.</p>

<p class="fst">In Austria-Hungary the centrifugal movement in the Slav regions 
was acutely accentuated. On the front itself the Austro-German command was 
forced to transfer many Slav troops to the Italian and French fronts, 
substituting these on the Russian front with picked German divisions. In the 
ranks of the Russian army appeared the extremely well-trained Czechoslovak 
forces. The abandonment by the Provisional Government of the old Czarist claim 
to Constantinople created a very favorable impression among the ruling elements 
in Turkey. Shortly before summer successful negotiations with Turkey for her 
exit from the War had already become possible. The same was true of Bulgaria, 
whose troops on the Russian Front had become quite demoralized.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, on the extreme north of the endless Russian Front, the 
politico-military situation was likewise altered to Germany's disadvantage. In 
Sweden the anti-German sentiment promoted by Branting and his group was given a 
powerful impetus, while in Finland the local activists, <i>i.e.</i>, the 
politico-military groups seeking to achieve Finland's independence by aiding 
Germany, abandoned their policy, at least temporarily. To be sure, all these 
military and political disadvantages were balanced in some measure by the German 
General Staff through the work of the Bolsheviki and the Ukrainian separatists. 
But the necessity forced upon Germany of returning German divisions and German 
artillery from the West to the Russian Front and increasing the number of German 
forces in the East made it impossible for Ludendorff, in the spring of 1918, to 
deliver a decisive blow in the West, before the arrival of the American troops.</p>

<p class="fst">But leaving aside all these political and international 
considerations, the restoration of the fighting capacity of the Russian army by 
the resumption of active operations was, in the spring of 1917, demanded by 
Russia's national consciousness. I could cite an endless list of decisions, 
resolutions, demands and orders for the resumption of the offensive. At the very 
beginning of the Revolution General Brusiloff telegraphed to the Provisional 
Government concerning the absolute need of an offensive. At the same time, Field 
Marshal Haig, in an order to the British army, announced receipt of a telegram 
from General Alexeyeff informing him that the Russian troops were preparing for 
an offensive.</p>

<p class="fst">The need of an offensive to "wipe out the shame" was constantly 
emphasized in its resolutions by the Temporary Committee of the Duma. The first 
conference of the Cadet party (Miliukoff's party) spoke likewise. The official 
organ of this party and the liberal press in general waged a campaign for an 
offensive, at times with even too much energy. The first conference of officers, 
meeting at General Headquarters in the middle of May, after presenting, in a 
resolution, a most critical picture of conditions in the army at the end of the 
Gutchkoff-Alexeyeff administration, insisted categorically on the need of 
resumption of action at the front. I may mention in passing that the officers' 
conference at General Headquarters laid the foundation for the Officers' Union 
in the army, a distinctly political body around whose executive committee was 
born the future military conspiracy headed by Korniloff.</p>

<p class="fst">Simultaneously with the conference at General Headquarters, the 
conference of democratic officers was in progress in Petrograd, which likewise 
demanded restoration of the fighting capacity of the Russian army. Delegations 
of front and army committees which came to Petrograd for "contact" with the 
government and the Soviet, after the German blow on the Stokhod, also insisted 
categorically on the resumption of the offensive by the army. The first congress 
of front delegates, in session at the time of Gutchkoff's resignation, gave 
expression to the same demand in the name of all the troops in the front lines. 
In the middle of April, the Petrograd Soviet, followed soon thereafter by the 
Executive Committee of the Congress of Soviets, took the same stand, although 
with certain reservations and ambiguities.</p>

<p class="fst">In short, there was not in the whole of Russia a single political 
group and social organization (with the sole exception of the Bolsheviki) which 
did not realize that the restoration of the fighting capacity of the Russian 
army and its assumption of the offensive was the immediate fundamental, 
imperative national task of Free Russia. For the sake of her future Russia had 
to perform this act of heroic sacrifice. And this act was performed, thanks to 
the popular enthusiasm, the will to sacrifice and the truly revolutionary 
enthusiasm which gripped the country.</p>

<h4>THE SOVIETS, THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE OFFENSIVE</h4>

<p class="fst">A month after the departure of Gutchkoff from the War Ministry 
and of Alexeyeff from General Headquarters, a profound change had taken place at 
the front and a considerable change in the country. "The War Ministry," wrote 
the semi-Bolshevist <i>Novaya Zshisn</i>, on May seventeenth, "is working with 
extraordinary energy, in cooperation with all the bourgeois and the majority of 
the democratic forces, for the restoration of the discipline and the fighting 
capacity of the army, and there is no longer any doubt of its aim: unification 
of the Allied front and an offensive against the enemy."</p>

<p class="fst">Neither was there any doubt in Berlin concerning the successful 
work of the Provisional Government. The transfer of German divisions to our 
front was greatly stimulated. The propaganda activity of the august 
commander-in-chief on the German Eastern Front, Prince Rupprecht, was likewise 
extended and intensified. The Bolshevist press, as well as the special sheets 
printed behind the enemy lines for distribution in the Russian trenches, 
developed a campaign of monstrous slander and misrepresentation against me and 
General Brusiloff.</p>

<p class="fst">On June fifteenth, the All-Russian Congress of Soviets opened in 
Petrograd. I will cite only one episode to show the sentiments of the delegates, 
particularly of the soldiers from the front. Some Bolshevik, in an effort to fan 
demagogic and anarchist instincts, began quoting from two "reactionary" orders 
of the Provisional Government, which had just been promulgated. In a fury of 
resentment he cited the particularly emphatic passages from a circular issued by 
Premier Lvoff calling upon all responsible elements throughout the country to 
combat the Bolshevist campaign of anarchy. To the astonishment and wrath of all 
the Bolsheviki in the hall, the Congress greeted every word of the circular with 
a storm of applause. Thereupon the Bolshevist orator took up my "Order No. 17," 
just published, dealing with measures for stopping desertion. At this point the 
Congress could no longer restrain itself. The assembly rose as one man in a 
stormy ovation.</p>

<p class="fst">In the face of the definite patriotic attitude of the first 
Congress of Soviets it was quite easy for me to put through my resolution 
approving the operations which were to begin at the front two weeks later. The 
resumption of the offensive was approved by the Congress, the Bolsheviki alone 
voting in the negative. This order was supplementary to the very severe 
anti-desertion law of the Provisional Government, adopted several days before. 
Having attained tremendous proportions in the last months of the Czarist regime 
and assumed the nature of an epidemic in the first two months of the Revolution, 
desertions in the army ceased by the beginning of military operations in the 
summer. According to official figures, the number of desertions in various parts 
of the front had been reduced by that time to between 200,000 and 500,000 men.</p>

<p class="fst">Incidentally it was at this Congress that I met Lenin for the 
first and only time. He was accompanied by his entire staff. Present were 
Kameneff, Zinovieff, Lunacharsky, as well as Trotsky, who, while still 
hesitating about joining the Bolsheviki, was already quite openly flirting with 
them. Sensing the violent opposition of the Congress, Lenin did not, however, 
restrain himself from offering a very simple method of solving the complex 
social problems. He suggested the "arrest of one hundred of the biggest 
capitalists." All the rest would then care for itself! This ingenious proposal, 
which evoked the enthusiasm of the street mobs assembled daily before the 
balcony of the Ksheshinskaya Palace, occupied by Lenin and his staff, brought 
only laughter and ridicule at the Congress. But those assembled here were the 
few, the best, the picked elements of the people and of the army, whereas there, 
outside the doors of the Congress, remained the dark, infuriated thousands of
<i>déclassé</i> elements, performing under conditions of war and revolution the 
role of the "class-conscious proletariat" in the shops and factories. On taking 
the floor to reply to Lenin, I was struck not so much by the effect produced by 
him on the delegates as by the realization of the destructive influence he 
wielded over audiences of another character.</p>

<p class="fst">I do not know what Lenin felt while listening to me. I do not 
even know whether he did listen to me or whether his ear was attuned principally 
to the sentiments of the audience. But he did not remain to the end of my 
address. Picking up his brief case, with head bent, he stole out of the hall 
sidewise, almost unnoticed. However, Lenin and his close lieutenants had more 
important business before them than the Congress of Soviets. Over the heads of 
the leaders of the democracy, who had "sold themselves to the bourgeoisie," they 
decided to appeal directly to the Petrograd proletariat, having planned to bring 
pressure to bear on the Congress by preparing another armed demonstration. The 
date set for the demonstration, if I recall aright, was June twenty-fourth. 
According to Lenin's plan, this demonstration, if successful, was to have been 
transformed into an armed uprising. The slogans of the movement were "Bread, 
Peace, Liberty"; "Away with the Capitalists"; "Revision of the Rights of 
Soldiers" and "Down with the Ten Capitalist Ministers." The tenth among these 
"enemies of the proletariat" and of the toiling masses was Kerensky. The 
remaining five ministers, all socialists, were for the present accorded mercy by 
Lenin.</p>

<p class="fst">The brazen effort to provoke new street riots was frustrated by 
the energetic action of the Soviet leaders. But the activities of the Bolsheviki 
in seeking to force disturbances in Petrograd at exactly the moment when the 
interests of the German General Staff at the front demanded it, gave rise to an 
interesting coincidence.</p>

<p class="fst">The Bolsheviki failed, however, in thwarting the offensive. But 
next month, on July sixteenth, the new operation undertaken by the Bolsheviki in 
Petrograd, in support of the German Staff, proved more successful.</p>

<h4>WITH THE ARMY BEFORE THE OFFENSIVE</h4>

<p class="fst">After carrying through the necessary resolution at the Congress 
of the Soviets, after visiting the Cossack Congress and receiving from the 
regimental committees of the Petrograd garrison the solemn promise that they 
would not take advantage of my absence to deal a treacherous blow to the 
Revolution, I left, on June twenty-sixth, for that part of the front where the 
offensive was to begin. In Tarnopol the military representatives of all the 
Allied staffs entered my car. In the name of the King of England, the British 
representative accredited to the Russian General Headquarters promised that the 
British armies would support our offensive. For reasons still unknown to me this 
promise was not kept. In Tarnopol I made public my order to the troops for the 
advance. The whole of Russia was tense with expectation. Would the troops 
advance? No one ventured to answer the question.</p>

<p class="fst">Beyond Tarnopol began the real, active front. How different was 
the situation now, as compared with that at the end of May, on my first visit to 
General Brusiloff! Then there was deadly silence and emptiness. Now there was 
life, movement, action preparatory for the great effort. The regiments were 
marching, ammunition boxes bumping, field kitchens thundering by toward the 
front lines. Artillery was roaring in the distance. At night, here and there 
over our positions, were to be seen the burning rockets of the Germans.</p>

<p class="fst">Slowly, with a kind of triumphant air, my train pulled up to the 
headquarters of General Hutor, commander of the Galician Front, near the small, 
out-of-the-way town of Kshivy, a short distance from the positions of the 
seventh army, which was to have moved first in the direction of the Brjezany.</p>

<p class="fst">Hutor, who succeeded Brusiloff as front commander, was not a 
particularly remarkable general. But he had a first-class chief-of-staff in 
General Dukhonin, one of the very best of Russia's officers, who had a brilliant 
career during the War and knew how to retain the respect of his soldiers in the 
very heat of the Revolution, without sacrificing in any way the honor of his 
uniform or the dignity of an honest citizen. Soon after the Bolshevist coup 
d'état, Dukhonin, at that time already chief of the General Staff, was lynched 
at the Mohileff station at General Headquarters, on the incitement of Krilenko.</p>

<p class="fst">On June twenty-sixth began the artillery preparation for the 
drive. For two days our artillery poured its fire on the enemy trenches. The 
reply of the watchful enemy was silence. The front line of their trenches had 
been cleared by the Germans. Their well camouflaged artillery was awaiting its 
hour. To be sure, not everything was quite in order in the spirit of the seventh 
and eleventh armies, which had been designated for the offensive. There were 
divisions in a state bordering on mutiny. There were regiments showing only 
perfunctory obedience. There were officers quite without "heart" and some who 
were frankly sabotaging the preparatory operations.</p>

<p class="fst">On June thirtieth, I inspected the positions. It is difficult now 
to describe our state of mind. High tension, determination and, at times, a 
feeling of impending triumph! A great deal of thought and feeling had been 
experienced by the army. Both officers and men were now going into battle not 
with the old emotions. We felt clearly their effort to overcome something in 
themselves, to free themselves from sensations unusual on the eve of battle. 
There was more depth, more spirituality, but less of concentrated harmony. The 
troops seemed to feel that the dent in their insides had not quite been removed. 
To the very last moment the officers did not know whether the soldiers would 
follow them in the attack. The soldiers were not quite sure whether it was 
necessary to die when there, in the rear, the fond dreams of generations were 
being realized.</p>

<p class="fst">On that day, in our final address to the troops before the 
battle, every one of us who spoke was particularly stirred. For were not our 
speeches the last greeting before death? The soldiers and many of the officers 
drank in every word, seeking to find in them the answer to the painful question 
which stirred their simple souls to the very last moment.</p>

<p class="fst">I remember a throng of soldiers in the region of the eleventh 
army, near a dugout, who attracted the attention of the German artillery. We had 
to talk under the music of the flying shells. But no one moved, no one ventured 
to seek shelter, no one even bent his head.</p>

<p class="fst">Again, I recall a trip late at night. Rain and storm. At one spot 
regiments which had just come up from the near were awaiting us. Under the 
terrific downpour, to the accompaniment of thunder and lightning, drenched 
through and through, the thousands did not move, anxious to find, in my words, 
faith in the justice of their coming sacrifice of death.</p>
