<h2><a name="h1">CHAPTER XI</a><br>
<small>THE NATION'S VICTORY</small></h2>

<p class="fst">IN looking back on the events of July, I must say that the 
failure of the Bolshevist uprising, together with the rapid retreat of our 
troops in Galicia, contributed to the strengthening of the feeling of patriotism 
and national responsibility among the masses of the people and in the leading 
circles of the Left, socialist, anti-Bolshevist parties.</p>

<p class="fst">The course of events in Russia between March and November, 1917, 
is usually conceived as a process of one color, of gradual but unceasing and 
constantly increasing disintegration of the country. In reality, however, Russia 
moved in those months along a zigzag line. Up until the middle of September (the 
period of the Korniloff rebellion) Russia advanced forward, with the line of 
progress accompanied by some drops and setbacks, but marked by steady diminution 
of revolutionary chaos and the development of political strength and wisdom. 
After the crushing of the Bolsheviki, in July, the process of convalescence 
gathered exceptional momentum. But it was halted suddenly by the madness of 
honest but politically ignorant and impatient generals. From the middle of 
September Russia began to move back with equally exceptional speed to 
dissolution and chaos.</p>

<p class="fst">Together with the new defeat of the Russian troops at the front 
came a nation-wide wave of anti-Bolshevist assaults. Bolshevist committees and 
newspapers were being wrecked everywhere in the interior. In all the provincial 
centers the Soviets were firmly in the hands of defensivist elements, patriotic, 
constructive and eager to restore the national structure. The representation of 
the Bolsheviki in the Executive Committee of the Soviets and in the All-Russian 
Executive Committee of the Congress of Soviets was reduced almost to zero. Hand 
in hand with the removal of all Bolsheviki from the Soviet machinery, it was 
becoming increasingly recognized by the Soviet leaders that the Soviets were not 
and could not be organs of government but were merely instruments useful in the 
process of transition to a new, ordered, democratic state.</p>

<p class="fst">The new laws worked out by the first cabinet of the Provisional 
Government, providing for a comprehensive system of municipal and zemstvo 
self-government, on the basis of universal, proportional, equal suffrage, 
including woman suffrage, came into force. At the beginning of August we find 
municipal dumas in two hundred cities already elected on the basis of the new 
law. At the end of September six hundred and fifty of the seven hundred cities 
of Russia had elected such new municipal dumas. Not quite so rapidly, due to 
rural conditions, but nevertheless at good speed moved the reorganization of the 
zemstvos along broad, democratic lines. The tremendously powerful development of 
the cooperatives, stimulated by the Provisional Government's cooperative law, 
created an extremely sound basis for the growth of a democratic state. The 
initial anarchic period of irresponsible proletarian action was being 
transformed gradually into a healthy trade-union movement, in which the 
Bolsheviki occupied a position of little influence on the extreme left flank. 
The authority of the government commissars in the army was growing steadily, in 
accordance with the government's plan of bringing the army back through the 
agency of the commissars, as connecting links from the committee system as 
established in March, to normal unity of command.</p>

<p class="fst">On July twenty-first, I again repeated my last order for the 
merciless application of armed force against insubordination at the front. I 
called the attention of the commissars and commanders to the Provisional 
Government's proclamation of July nineteenth, prohibiting agitation against the 
government and the War among the troops. Simultaneously I telegraphed an order 
to General Headquarters demanding "the removal and prosecution of commanders 
showing the slightest reluctance to apply force." On July twentieth I had 
arrested the delegation of the General Committee of the Baltic Fleet, upon its 
arrival in Petrograd to help the Bolsheviki "arrest Minister of Justice 
Pereverzeff and Assistant Minister of the Navy Dudyrenko." The rule adopted by 
the government upon its formation, in the first days of the Revolution, not to 
disarm or to remove from Petrograd the military units which had taken part in 
the revolutionary movement, a rule tending to disorganize and pervert the 
garrison, was abolished. Henceforward the government granted commanders the 
right to reorganize the regiments of the Petrograd garrison and send them to the 
front. On July twenty-first an order was made public, by unanimous decision of 
the Provisional Government, restoring capital punishment and providing for the 
establishment of court-martial at the front. At the same time the government 
restored military censorship, giving to the Minister of the Interior, by 
agreement with the Minister of War, the right to suppress newspapers and 
fly-by-night sheets, to prohibit meetings, make arrests without the usual court 
warrants, to expel from Russia by executive order persons considered dangerous 
to the safety of the nation and in general to take the measures found necessary 
in the interest of national security and defense.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course, these measures for the strengthening of the government 
did not meet with instant approval by everybody. In the minds of many political 
figures who were removed from sympathy with the Left, the strengthening of the 
revolutionary Government's administrative power aroused unpleasant memories of 
the police lawlessness of the old regime. Particularly disquieting to public 
opinion were the measures effecting the press.</p>

<p class="fst">The suppression of Bolshevist papers, particularly at the front, 
naturally met with universal approval. But when the situation reached a point 
where it was necessary to forbid the further publication of two big newspapers 
in the capital&#8212;Maxim Gorky's ultraradical <i>Novaya Zshisn</i> and the 
extremist-conservative <i>Novoye Vremia</i>&#8212;there arose a cry of sharp protest 
from all political and literary circles, without exception. People said that 
Kerensky wished to restore for the press the regime of Pleve (the universally 
hated minister of the interior under Nicholas II, assassinated at the beginning 
of the Russo-Japanese War). The right of administrative arrest actually became 
one of the causes of the dispute between the Provisional Government and the 
representatives of the Constitutional-Democratic party at the time of the new 
cabinet crisis, following the Bolshevist uprising.</p>

<p class="fst">Faithful to the doctrine of government by law, the liberal 
jurists protested emphatically against the "lawlessness the government was 
legalizing." To be sure, the same party demanded from the government extreme 
lawlessness,
<i>i.e.</i>, the widest possible administrative struggle against the Bolsheviki, 
but the partial inconsistency was determined by the fact that the proposed 
administrative expulsions from Russia and the administrative arrests threatened 
principally at that time, in August, not revolutionists on the Left but 
opponents on the Right, who had begun with increasing boldness to speak up in 
favor of the developing movement for a military dictatorship.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1*]</a></p>

<h4>MY ASSUMPTION OF THE PREMIERSHIP</h4>

<p class="fst">On July twentieth, the day after my return from the front, Prince 
George Lvoff left the Provisional Government. The situation had become too 
difficult for his mild manner of governing. At the same cabinet meeting at which 
the resignation of the prince was accepted, I was named premier, retaining also 
my post of minister of war and marine.</p>

<p class="fst">The new government crisis began to develop seriously only after 
the departure of the prince.</p>

<p class="fst">On July twenty-second, the All-Russian Executive Committee of the 
Congress of Soviets and the Executive Committee of the Congress of Peasants, in 
a joint manifesto to the country, proclaimed the Provisional Government as "the 
government for the Salvation of the Fatherland and the Revolution." The 
manifesto called upon the soldiers, peasants and workers to grant full 
confidence and obedience to the united, national people's government. At the 
same time, a general meeting of the regiments of the Petrograd garrison 
unanimously adopted a resolution expressing confidence "only in the Provisional 
Government."</p>

<p class="fst">However, confidence in the Provisional Government on the part of 
the revolutionary and democratic organizations was not enough. It was essential 
to restore the union of all the live forces of the country, upon which depended 
the quick rehabilitation of the nation. The places left vacant by the 
resignation of the three Cadet ministers had to be filled by men of the same 
political and social ideas. In July this was even more important than it was in 
April or May, for now behind the Constitutional-Democratic party were organized 
all the political and social forces of the country representing the interests of 
the propertied classes, of the high command, the remnants of the old bureaucracy 
and even fragments of the aristocracy. By this I do not wish to accuse in any 
way the party headed by Miliukoff&#8212;which had in the past performed great service 
in the cause of Russian liberation&#8212;of having "changed its program and entered 
the service of reaction," as the Bolshevist demagogues put it. The 
Constitutional-Democratic party had retained its entire ideology. Only the human 
material filling its ranks had changed radically. It must be remembered that all 
the parties to the right of the liberal center had disappeared after the 
Revolution, while the Cadet party itself had become the right flank of Russian 
political life.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was quite evident that the formation of a national government 
standing above all parties and partisanship required the inclusion of 
responsible representatives of the right flank of the political spectrum, in the 
persons of those members of this group who after the upheaval of March twelfth 
had adopted an outspoken republican attitude.</p>

<p class="fst">The spokesmen of the Socialist parties and the leaders of the 
Soviets quite frankly expressed the aim of filling the vacant posts in the 
Provisional Government, after the exit of Prince Lvoff, without resort to the 
Constitutional-Democrats. The cabinet situation remained uncertain from July 
twentieth to July twenty-sixth, for on the very day of my appointment as premier 
I had to return to the front. Upon my return from Denikin's army, on or about 
July twenty-seventh, all the ministers placed their portfolios at my disposal. 
This collective resignation cleared the road for filling the ministerial 
vacancies.</p>

<p class="fst">At first, after the outbreak of the Revolution, the Provisional 
Government was seemingly appointed by the Temporary Committee of the Duma and it 
had to seek agreement with the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet. The 
second cabinet of the Provisional Government was formed in cooperation with 
representatives of the respective parties, the Soviet and the Temporary 
Committee of the Duma. Now the formation of the new cabinet of the Provisional 
Government was placed solely in the hands of its premier, which naturally made 
the future cabinet more independent of exterior party pressure.</p>

<p class="fst">The negotiations between the Premier and the central committees 
of the respective parties continued for ten days. Once more there were 
interminable programatic disputes. Long letters were written, in which the 
points at issue between the respective parties were purposely accentuated for 
bargaining purposes. Naturally this served only to irritate the opponents but in 
no way changed the substance of the discussion. Moreover, although formally I 
was given complete freedom of action in the selection of the ministers, I found 
myself confronted by ultimatums from the respective parties and organizations 
objecting to some candidates or demanding the appointment of others.</p>

<p class="fst">I personally was placed in quite a strange position: under the 
political circumstances of the moment I bore full responsibility for the fate of 
the nation, yet I did not have the simple right to choose freely my immediate 
coworkers, for whose activity in the government I could really and with a clear 
conscience hold myself responsible before the people. My situation became all 
the more difficult because both the contending camps (the bourgeois and the 
democratic) maintained equally that it was absolutely essential that I assume 
the premiership of the Provisional Government. In fact, they saw no other 
candidate acceptable for the post. All the parties collectively wished to work 
with me, but every one of them individually placed before me conditions 
obviously unacceptable to the others. The party bargaining for the vacant 
ministerial seats continued to grow more and more heated. Meanwhile, the 
prolongation of the cabinet crisis aggravated the already difficult situation in 
the country and particularly at the front, where the pressure of the German 
troops served to stimulate what on the whole was a natural and wholesome feeling 
of patriotic concern, though it did not at all moments assume proper form among 
the officers.</p>

<p class="fst">It became evident that the Russian political parties, with none 
of which I was completely in agreement and among all of which I had friends and 
supporters, had to be placed before a clear alternative: either they themselves 
assume full responsibility for the fate of the nation or they must give me at 
least some measure of freedom to do what I considered necessary for the country, 
regardless of party doctrines and self-interest. On August third I divested 
myself of all offices and titles, turned over all current affairs to the 
Vice-Premier and left secretly for Tsarskoye Selo. Immediately the central 
committee of all the parties sent out urgent invitations to a meeting of 
extraordinary political importance. On the evening of the day of my departure an 
historic meeting of responsible representatives of all the parties upon which 
the government supported itself took place in the Malachite Hall of the Winter 
Palace. I do not wish to describe that which I did not witness. I know only that 
the meeting lasted all night, adjourning at four o'clock in the morning. Finding 
themselves face to face with the question of responsibility for the country no 
one of those present ventured to take the responsibility upon himself. The 
meeting adjourned finally with the decision to entrust me again with filling the 
posts of the Provisional Government as I saw fit, without being hampered by 
pressure, claims or demands from any of the parties. To be sure, this decision 
was immediately violated by both sides&#8212;the Left and the Right. By both sides I 
was informed "quite privately": "Of course, you are entirely free to choose the 
members of the government, but if you invite this or that person the central 
committee of our party will consider this participation in the government a 
matter concerning only himself." In other words I was "privately" threatened 
with militant hostility by the parties.</p>

<p class="fst">Such party duplicity naturally had an extremely detrimental 
effect on the activity of the Provisional Government as constructed by me. It 
deprived the government of that unity so essential in such an extraordinarily 
difficult time. I resolved, however, to return to power, believing that the 
realization by all parties of the need of my participation in the government 
would give, for a time at least, an opportunity to fight for the restoration of 
Russia. Perhaps it was a cardinal mistake on my part to return to power at that 
moment. Perhaps I should have retired for the time being at the moment when 
outside of the central committees of the various parties and the circles of 
professional politicians, my prestige and popularity in the country were very 
great. Perhaps by preserving my authority with the people I might have saved 
something which would have been of use to Russia in the darkest days that were 
still ahead.</p>

<p class="fst">Perhaps? I do not know. At any rate it certainly would have been 
salutary so far as I myself was concerned. Contrary to the assertions of my 
adversaries on the Right and on the Left I had no "thirst for power." More than 
once I suggested to the unrestrained critics of the policy of the Provisional 
Government that they assume formal responsibility for the country, provided they 
did so without resort to uprising and mutiny. My return to the Winter Palace was 
motivated by the realization of my duty to the country.</p>

<p class="fst">Under the prevailing circumstances, when the country is 
threatened by internal dissolution and external disintegration [I wrote 
officially on August sixth, to the Vice-Premier] I consider it impossible to 
shirk the grave duty placed upon me by the representatives of the principal 
socialist, democratic and liberal parties.</p>

<p class="fst">In the same letter I laid down what to my mind were the guiding 
lines requisite for governing the country.</p>

<p class="indentb">As the basis of the solution of this problem I place my 
unshakable conviction that the salvation of the Republic demands abandonment of 
party quarrels and that the national work of the salvation of the country, which 
concerns the people as a whole, must proceed under conditions and in forms 
dictated by the severe necessity of continuing the War, supporting the fighting 
capacity of the army and restoring the economic power of the nation.</p>

<p class="fst">After a night of mental and spiritual anguish, experienced 
likewise by all the participants of the meeting, I formed the new cabinet within 
twenty-four hours. Contrary to the practice of the first months of the 
Revolution, the members of the government, the bearers of supreme authority, 
were now formally released from any dependence or party committees, Soviets, 
etc. Their responsibility was now "only to the country and their own 
conscience." There were no more Soviet or Duma ministers. There were only 
ministers of the Russian government. The practice of collective, long 
ministerial declarations, of use only to the extreme party dogmatists, was 
likewise abandoned now.</p>

<p class="fst">The composition of the new cabinet corresponded to the 
nonpartisan, national governmental program.</p>

<p class="fst">Of the sixteen ministers only three were opponents of a 
bourgeois-democratic coalition. Two of these (Yureneff and Kokoshkin, 
representing the Constitutional-Democratic party) favored a purely bourgeois 
government, while the other (Minister of Agriculture Tchernoff, leader of the 
Socialists-Revolutionists) wanted a purely socialist government. All the other 
ministers were firm supporters of a government combining within itself all the 
creative political forces of the nation, regardless of party or class 
distinction.</p>

<p class="fst">The very marked change of popular attitude after the crushing of 
the Bolsheviki&#8212;the strengthening of the state and the independence of the 
governmental machinery from partisan political organizations&#8212;was evidenced by 
the fact that of the sixteen members of the government only two (Tchernoff, 
Socialist-Revolutionist, and Skobeleff, Social-Democrat, were connected closely 
with the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet.</p>

<p class="fst">The new situation was summarized well by Irakli Tseretelli, one 
of the noblest and most talented leaders of the Russian Social-Democracy 
(afterwards leader of the Georgian Social-Democratic party). With characteristic 
courage this leader, devoted disinterestedly to the cause of the democracy as a 
whole, recognized frankly the fundamental change that had come about in the 
correlation of the country's political and social forces.</p>

<p class="fst">"We have just experienced not only a cabinet crisis but a crisis 
of the Revolution," he said at a meeting of the All-Russian Executive Committee 
of the Congress of Soviets and before the Executive Committee of the Peasant 
Congress. "A new era in the history of the Revolution has begun. Two months ago 
the Soviets were stronger. Now we have become weaker, for the correlation of 
forces has changed to our disadvantage."</p>

<p class="fst">Tseretelli urged full confidence in the government, realizing 
that the change that had taken place was entirely to the advantage of the 
country as a whole, for it strengthened the national consciousness of the people 
as well as the power and prestige of the state.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1*]</a> The opposite was also true: Some sections of the Left, socialist press, 
while demanding draconic police repressions against "counter-revolutionists" on 
the Right, expressed bitter indignation at the government's "lawlessness" with 
regard to the Bolsheviki. A curious picture was presented as a result, with the 
Provisional Government being simultaneously under "pressure" of both extreme 
flanks.&#8212;A. K.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n2" href="#fn2">[2*]</a> The left flank was occupied by the Bolsheviki and the extreme elements of 
the Mensheviki and Socialists-Revolutionists. The center was composed of 
Menshevist Social-Democrats, Laborites, Populist-Socialists, backed by the 
cooperatives, the majority of municipal dumas chosen on the basis of universal 
suffrage, the front and army committees, etc.</p>
