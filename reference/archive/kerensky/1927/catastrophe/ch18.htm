<h2><a name="h1">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br>
<small>GATCHINA</small></h2>

<p class="fst">THE last act in the struggle of the Provisional Government 
against the Bolsheviki on the Right and on the Left was played between November 
sixth and fourteenth, 1917.</p>

<p class="fst">After the abortive attempt of the conspirators behind General 
Korniloff&#8212;so fatal in its consequences for the entire country&#8212;to overthrow the 
Provisional Government, the social groups supporting the "dictator" decided to 
give no aid to the government in the event of its collision with the Bolsheviki. 
Their strategic plan was not to hinder in any way the success of an armed 
Bolshevist uprising and, then, after the fall of the Provisional Government they 
so hated, quickly to suppress the Bolshevist "mutiny." In this way were to be 
realized finally the aims set for the Korniloff rebellion.</p>

<p class="fst">The military and civil strategists who were the authors of this 
plan were thoroughly convinced that the Bolshevist triumph would entail no 
serious danger and that within three or four weeks the "sound elements" of the 
Russian people would make short shrift of the mutinous mass and establish a 
"strong government" in Russia. Alas, having successfully carried out the first, 
so-called passive part of this plan, having "overthrown" the Provisional 
Government with the hands of the Bolsheviki, the "patriots" found themselves 
absolutely unable to execute the second, activist part of their program. They 
failed to defeat the Bolsheviki not only in three weeks but in ten years!</p>

<p class="fst">On November sixth it had become quite evident that the uprising 
was inevitable, that it had already begun. At about eleven o'clock in the 
morning I appeared before the Council of the Republic and requested from N. D. 
Avksentieff, the President, permission to make an urgent statement. On taking 
the floor I informed the council that I had in my possession unmistakable 
evidence of the organization by Lenin and his lieutenants of an uprising against 
the Provisional Government. I declared that all possible measures were being 
taken by the Provisional Government for the suppression of the uprising and that 
the government would fight to the end against the betrayers of the motherland 
and of the Revolution. I declared that the government would resort without 
qualms to the use of force, but that to insure the government's success the 
immediate cooperation of all parties and groups, and of the entire people, was 
necessary. I demanded from the Council of the Republic full confidence and 
cooperation. The atmosphere of the meeting and the sentiments of those assembled 
were indicated by the ovations which greeted my declaration, the members 
punctuating their approval and expressing their solidarity with the Provisional 
Government in its fight against the enemies of the people by rising from their 
seats. In those moments of general national indignation only a handful of 
leaders, representing the two extreme political flanks, could not subdue in 
themselves their fierce hatred against the government of the March Revolution. 
They kept their seats when the rest of the assembly rose as one man.</p>

<p class="fst">Convinced that the representatives of the nation were fully 
conscious of the seriousness of the situation and of their own responsibility, I 
returned, without awaiting the actual vote, to Staff Headquarters to resume 
important unfinished business, confident that within an hour or two I would be 
informed of the decisions and active preparations of the Council of the Republic 
in support of the government.</p>

<p class="fst">Nothing of the sort happened. The council, torn by inner discords 
and irreconcilable differences of opinion, could not come to a decision until 
late into the night. Instead of organizing all their forces for the difficult 
struggle against the traitors, the leaders of all the anti-Bolshevist and 
democratic parties wasted the entire day and evening in useless quarrels and 
disputes.</p>

<p class="fst">And meanwhile, the Bolsheviki, being already entrenched at Smolny 
Institute, preparing for the final blow, were proclaiming loudly that all 
assertions concerning "some kind of a Bolshevist uprising" were pure inventions 
of "counter-revolutionists" and of "that enemy of the people&#8212;Kerensky." By this 
maneuver, knowing well the psychology of their opponents, the Bolsheviki were 
successfully attaining their aims.</p>

<p class="fst">I shall never forget the following truly historical scene.</p>

<p class="fst">My office, midnight, November sixth. The Provisional Government 
has just met and adjourned for a short recess. A stormy conversation between 
myself and a delegation from the Socialist groups in the Council of the Republic 
concerning the final adoption by the Left majority of the council of the 
resolution I had demanded in the morning. This resolution, as adopted, was now 
of no more use to anybody, being endlessly long and involved, of little meaning 
to simple mortals. If, in its substance, it did not directly express lack of 
confidence in the government, it drew an obvious line of distinction between the 
Left majority of the council and the government and its struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">Enraged, I informed the delegation that after such a resolution 
the government would resign to-morrow and that the authors of the resolution and 
all those who had voted for it must take upon themselves all responsibility for 
events, although apparently they seemed to have little conception of the 
situation.</p>

<p class="fst">The reply to my outburst was delivered calmly and analytically by 
Dan, at that time not only leader of the Mensheviki but also president of the 
All-Russian Executive Committee of Soviets. I cannot, of course, repeat Dan's 
historic reply textually but I vouch for the substance. First of all, Dan told 
me that the delegation was more correctly informed than I was and that I was 
exaggerating developments, due to the misinformation of my "reactionary staff." 
He then added that the resolution of the Council of the Republic, however 
unpalatable to the "government's sense of self-respect," was extremely useful 
and desirable for its psychologic effect on the masses, that this "effect" was 
already noticeable, and that the influence of Bolshevist propaganda was now 
bound "to decline rapidly." On the other hand, Dan continued, the Bolsheviki 
themselves, in their negotiations with the leaders of the Soviet majority, 
expressed readiness to "subordinate themselves to the will of the Soviet 
majority" and were willing, beginning to-morrow, to undertake all measures to 
stop the uprising, "which had begun against their wish and without their 
sanction." In conclusion Dan, asserting that the Bolsheviki would "to-morrow" 
(always to-morrow!) disband their military staff, declared that all measures 
taken by me for suppression of the uprising tended only to "disturb the masses" 
and that, in general, my "intervention" served only to "interfere with the 
success of the negotiations of the majority of the Soviets with the Bolsheviki 
for liquidation of the uprising." At the very moment when Dan was communicating 
to me this remarkable information, armed detachments of the "Red Guard" were 
already occupying one government building after another. Almost immediately upon 
the departure of Dan and his comrades from the Winter Palace, Kartasheff, 
Minister of Cults, was arrested in Millionnaya street, on his way home from the 
meeting of the Provisional Government, and taken to Smolny, whither Dan had 
departed for negotiation with the Bolsheviki.</p>

<p class="fst">One must admit that the Bosheviki were acting with great energy 
and no less great skill.</p>

<p class="fst">While the uprising was in full swing and "Red" troops were in 
action all over the city, some Bolshevist leaders especially assigned to the 
task tried, not without success, to make the representatives of the "Soviet 
democracy" blind to what was actually taking place. The entire night was spent 
by these acrobats in endless disputes on various formula? supposed to serve as 
conditions of peace and liquidation of the uprising. By this method of 
"negotiation" the Bolsheviki gained a great deal of valuable time. The fighting 
forces of the Socialists-Revolutionists and Mensheviki were not mobilized in 
time.</p>

<p class="fst">I had hardly concluded my conversation with Dan and his comrades, 
when into the room came a delegation from the Cossack regiments then stationed 
in Petrograd, consisting, if I recall aright, of two or three officers and as 
many Cossacks. The delegation informed me, first, that they wanted to know what 
forces I had at my disposal for suppression of the mutiny. They then declared 
that the Cossack regiments would defend the government, but only on condition of 
my assurance that this time the blood of the Cossacks would not be spilled in 
vain, as it was in July, when I was supposed to have failed to take sufficiently 
energetic measures against the mutineers. Finally, the delegates insisted that 
they would fight only on my personal orders.</p>

<p class="fst">In reply, I first of all pointed out to the Cossacks that 
declarations such as they were making were quite inadmissible from men of 
military duty, particularly when the nation faced great peril, and that it was 
incumbent upon every one of us to fulfill his obligation to the end! I then 
added: "You know full well that at the time of the Bolshevist uprising of July 
sixteenth to nineteenth, I was at the front where the offensive was then 
beginning. You know that, after leaving the front, I arrived in Petrograd on 
July nineteenth and immediately ordered the arrest of all the Bolshevist 
chieftains. You know, also, that I immediately dismissed General Polovtzoff as 
commander of the troops because of his indecision during the uprising."</p>

<p class="fst">As a result of this conversation, the Cossacks declared 
categorically that all their regiments in Petrograd would do their duty. I 
thereupon signed a special order to the Cossacks, commanding them to place 
themselves at the disposal of the district military staff and to carry out all 
its instructions. At that moment, at 1 A.M. on the night of November sixth, I 
had not the slightest doubt that these three regiments of Don Cossacks would not 
violate their oath and I immediately sent an adjutant to Staff Headquarters with 
the information that the Cossacks could be relied upon fully.</p>

<p class="fst">As in the morning, at the meeting of the Council of the Republic, 
I made a grave mistake. I did not know that while I was conversing with the 
regimental delegates, the Council of Cossack Troops, meeting all night, had 
proclaimed the
<i>neutrality</i> of the Cossacks in the struggle of the Provisional Government 
against the Bolshevist uprising.</p>

<p class="fst">Following my conversations with Dan and with the Cossacks I 
returned to the meeting of the Provisional Government. One can imagine the 
tension that marked the meeting, particularly after the arrival of information 
concerning the seizure by the "Red Guard" of the central telephone station, the 
main post office and other government buildings. None of us, however, thought 
for a moment of the possibility of any negotiations or agreements with the 
traitors at Smolny. As I remember, the government concluded its meeting at 2 
A.M. and the ministers went home. I remained alone with Konovaloff, Vice-Premier 
and Minister of Commerce and Industry. We worked together all night, after M. 
Terestchenko, who had tarried a while longer at the Winter Palace after the 
departure of the other ministers, had gone.</p>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile, the uprising in the city was developing with 
tremendous speed. Armed detachments of Bolsheviki were closing in upon the 
Winter Palace and the Military District Staff Headquarters. Some soldiers of the 
Pavlovsk Guards Regiment set up a real ambush in their barracks at the end of 
Millionnaya street, near the Field of Mars, arresting all "suspicious" persons 
coming from the direction of the palace. The palace was guarded only by military 
cadets and a small squadron of armored motor cars. Immediately upon adjournment 
of the cabinet meeting, the commander of the garrison and his chief-of-staff 
appeared before me. They offered to organize an expedition of all the forces 
loyal to the government, including the Cossacks, for the capture of Smolny 
Institute, the Staff Headquarters of the Bolsheviki. During this conversation I 
followed with more and more interest the ambiguous behavior of Colonel 
Polkovnikoff, being increasingly impressed by the crying contradiction between 
his all too optimistic and reassuring reports and the sad reality of the 
situation as I already knew it. It became more than evident that all his reports 
of the past ten to twelve days concerning the attitude of the troops and the 
preparedness of his own staff for a decisive struggle with the Bolsheviki had no 
basis in fact.</p>

<p class="fst">The government's commissar attached to the municipal 
administration, Rogovsky, appeared during my conference with the commander of 
the troops. He brought alarming news, contradicting in every way the reports 
just presented by Colonel Polkovnikoff. We learned from Rogovsky, among other 
things, that a considerable number of warships from the Baltic Fleet had entered 
the Neva in battle formation, that some of these ships had moved as far as the 
Nicholayevsky Bridge, and that this bridge had been, in turn, occupied by 
detachments of mutineers, who were already advancing farther toward the palace 
bridge. Rogovsky drew our attention especially to the fact that the Bolsheviki 
were carrying out their plan without any trouble, meeting no resistance on the 
part of the government troops. To me personally Rogovsky reported his 
observation that the staff of the Petrograd military district was watching the 
developments with utter indifference, showing no inclination for activity on its 
part.</p>

<p class="fst">The contradiction between the report presented by Rogovsky and 
that of Colonel Polkovnikoff was shockingly obvious. There was not a minute more 
to lose. It was necessary to hurry to Staff Headquarters!</p>

<p class="fst">Together with A. T. Konovaloff and accompanied by an adjutant, I 
left for the staff building, passing through the endless, almost dark corridors 
and lower chambers of the palace, where the military cadets who were off duty 
were preparing for bed. The staff building was filled with officers of all ranks 
and ages and delegates of various military units. Amidst this military throng 
moved about some strange civilians. Rushing up to the third story, directly into 
the office of the commander of the troops, I requested Colonel Polkovnikoff to 
present a report on the situation immediately. The report convinced 
us&#8212;Konovaloff and me&#8212;that it was no longer possible to rely on Colonel 
Polkovnikoff and the majority of the officers of his staff. It became urgent in 
this eleventh hour to take command into one's own hands, not only for an 
offensive against the mutineers but for the defense of the government itself, 
pending the arrival of fresh troops from the front and reorganization of the 
government's forces in the capital.</p>

<p class="fst">Within the district staff there were a number of high ranking 
officers upon whom I could rely with absolute confidence. But there were too few 
of them. I summoned by telephone those of them whose presence appeared most 
necessary and asked them to come to Staff Headquarters without delay. Then I 
decided to bring into action the volunteer military organizations of the 
parties, particularly the considerably numerous organization of the Party of 
Socialists-Revolutionists. The hours of the night dragged on painfully. From 
everywhere we expected reenf orcements, but none appeared. There were endless 
telephone negotiations with the Cossack regiments. Under various excuses the 
Cossacks stubbornly stuck to their barracks, asserting all the time that 
"everything would be cleared up" within fifteen or twenty minutes and that they 
would then "begin to saddle their horses."</p>

<p class="fst">On the other hand, the volunteer military forces at the disposal 
of the party organizations likewise evinced no activity. This rather puzzling 
circumstance was to be explained by the fact that the party centers, engrossed 
in endless negotiations with Smolny, and relying more on the force of 
"resolutions" than on the power of bayonets, had failed to issue the necessary 
orders in time.</p>

<p class="fst">Meanwhile the night hours passed. And the closer morning 
approached, the tenser grew the atmosphere at the Staff Headquarters. One honest 
and devoted officer, summoned to duty, came to me and after observing what was 
going on in the staff building and following closely the actions of Colonel 
Polkovnikoff, declared that he could not term the things he had seen otherwise 
than betrayal. The many officers assembled in the staff building conducted 
themselves in their attitude towards the government, and particularly towards me 
personally, in an increasingly defiant manner. As I learned afterwards they were 
engaged, on the initiative of Colonel Polkovnikoff, in an agitation for my 
arrest. At first they did this quietly, in whispers, but towards morning they 
began to talk quite loudly, almost without embarrassment and without regard to 
the presence of "strangers." A mad idea had struck the minds of many of them in 
those moments: without Kerensky it would be easier to "finish" the Bolsheviki 
and establish finally that so-called "strong government." And there is no doubt 
that throughout that night Colonel Polkovnikoff and certain other officers of 
the district staff were in constant contact with conservative anti-government 
organizations, such as the Council of Cossack Troops, the Union of the Knights 
of St. George, the Petrograd branch of the Union of Officers and other similar 
military and civil organizations.</p>

<p class="fst">Naturally, this suffocating atmosphere could not remain without 
effect on the spirits of those defenders of the government who were in touch 
with the staff. Already on the previous evening the military cadets, who had 
been in a confident state of mind, had begun to lose courage. Later, the crews 
of the armored cars began to grow panicky. Every moment of futile waiting for 
reenforcements lowered the fighting spirit of both.</p>

<p class="fst">At seven o'clock in the morning, after conversation by direct 
wire with the Staff Headquarters of the commander of the Northern front, in an 
effort to prevail upon him to rush loyal reenforcements to Petrograd, for the 
Cossacks were still "saddling their horses," Konovaloff and I, weary and 
exhausted by the impressions of the night, returned to the Winter Palace for a 
bit of rest. I remember how on the way we were surrounded several times by 
groups of excited military cadets. I remember how I had to reassure them and to 
explain all the probable consequences to the nation of a success for the 
Bolsheviki.</p>

<p class="fst">I had intended, on arriving in my rooms, to get together all my 
correspondence and all documents in my keeping and have them sent somewhere else 
for safe keeping, but I abandoned this intention, realizing the discouraging 
effect this would produce on all those in the palace. As a result, some of my 
papers, among them documents of not inconsiderable interest, fell into the hands 
of the Bolsheviki, while others disappeared.</p>

<p class="fst">After parting with Konovaloff and issuing some urgent 
instructions to cover possible eventualities, I remained alone in my study. 
Without undressing I lay down on the couch in my room. To sleep was impossible. 
I lay with my eyes closed, dozing, in a kind of semi-consciousness. Hardly an 
hour had passed when I was roused by a noncommissioned officer, who came in with 
urgent information: the Bolsheviki had captured the central telephone station 
and all our palace wire communications with the city had been cut. The palace 
bridge (beneath my windows) was occupied by Bolshevist sailor-pickets. The 
palace square was dead and empty. Not a word from the Cossacks, as was to have 
been expected.</p>

<p class="fst">In another ten minutes, both of us&#8212;Konovaloff and I&#8212;with all my 
adjutants were racing back to Staff Headquarters. Nothing had changed there in 
the two hours of our absence. No, something had changed; some of the units 
operating the armored cars had "disappeared." The armored cars were now about as 
useful as water wagons. The approaches to the palace and to Staff Headquarters, 
separated from one another by the palace square, were absolutely undefended. 
There was no news of any reenforcements from the Northern Front, although they 
should have been by this time in Gatchina. There was the beginning of panic. The 
staff building, filled to capacity all the previous evening and all night, was 
being gradually deserted.</p>

<p class="fst">I had hardly entered the Staff Headquarters when a delegation of 
the military cadets guarding the palace appeared. It developed that the 
Bolsheviki had sent them a formal ultimatum demanding surrender of the palace on 
pain of merciless repressions. The delegates wanted instructions, saying that 
the majority of their comrades were ready to do their duty to the end, if there 
was any hope of at least some reenforcements. It was evident, under the 
circumstances, that only the quick arrival of reenforcements from the front 
could save the situation.</p>

<p class="fst">But how to obtain those reenforcements? There was but one thing 
to do: to lose no more time and go to meet the echelons, delayed somewhere near 
Gatchina, and hurry them forward to Petrograd, regardless of all obstacles. 
After conferring with Konovaloff and Kishkin (who had arrived in the meanwhile) 
and consulting with several loyal officers of the staff, I decided to break 
through the Bolshevist lines and personally meet the advancing troops 
approaching, as we believed, in the direction of Petrograd.</p>

<p class="fst">To do this it was necessary, first, to cross the entire city in 
full view of everybody, without arousing the attention of the Bolshevist troops 
and Red Guard patrols scattered throughout the capital. This was most difficult 
of all. After some consideration it was decided to stake all on one play. To 
remove all suspicion we determined to act openly.</p>

<p class="fst">I called for my open touring car. My soldier-chauffeur, with whom 
I had covered the entire front, was a brave and devoted man. One of my adjutants 
made clear to him the task we were embarking upon. Without a moment's hesitation 
he accepted it. As luck would have it, the supply of gasoline was not sufficient 
for the long journey, nor were there reserve tires. We preferred to take the 
risk of running out of gasoline and of the absence of the reserve tire to the 
possibility of attracting attention by prolonging the preparations, I took along 
with me Captain Kuzmin, assistant commander of the garrison, and a staff 
officer.</p>

<p class="fst">I do not know how it happened but the news of my proposed 
departure reached the Allied embassies. Just as we were about to leave, 
representatives of the British and, as far as I can remember, of the American 
embassies arrived saying that the Allied envoys desired that I be accompanied by 
an automobile flying the American flag. Although it was more than evident that 
the American flag could not save me and my companions in the event of our 
failure and that, on the contrary, it would only attract unnecessary attention 
on our passing through the city, I accepted the suggestion as evidence of the 
interest of the Allies in the Russian Provisional Government and their 
solidarity with it.</p>

<p class="fst">Shaking hands for the last time with Kishkin, who took upon 
himself the direction of the defense of the capital in my absence, I went out 
into the yard of the staff building, together with my companions. We entered my 
car. Close at hand was the American machine. One of my officers, unable to find 
room in my car, decided to travel alone, but on the condition that in passing 
through the city he was to keep his machine, flying the American flag, at a 
"respectful distance" from ours. Finally, we moved. We followed closely all the 
details of my daily travel through the city. I occupied my usual seat&#8212;on the 
right, in the rear. I wore my customary semi-military uniform, which had become 
so familiar to the population and to the troops. The automobile moved at the 
usual city speed. At the very beginning of the Morskaya, near the telephone 
station, we passed the first Bolshevist guard. Some distance beyond, at the 
Astoria Hotel and at the Maryinsky Palace, were additional patrols and 
detachments of Bolsheviki. I need hardly say that the entire street&#8212;pedestrians 
and soldiers&#8212;recognized me immediately. The soldiers straightened up, as they 
would ordinarily have done. I saluted, as usual. In all probability, the moment 
after I passed not one of them could account to himself how it was possible for 
him not only to have permitted this "counter-revolutionist," this "enemy of the 
people" to pass, but also to have saluted him.</p>

<p class="fst">Having passed safely through the center of the city, on entering 
the workmen's section and approaching the Moscow Toll Gate we increased our pace 
and, finally, moved with breakneck speed. I remember how at the very exit from 
the city Red Guardsmen, patroling the road, came rushing towards our machine 
from all sides of the <i>chaussée</i>, but we had already passed them, while 
they had not only failed to make an effort to stop us, but had not even had time 
to take a good look at us.</p>

<p class="fst">At Gatchina we drove up straight to the palace gate leading to 
the commandant's quarters. We were chilled through and through by the mad drive. 
On learning, to our great surprise, that there were no echelons from the front 
at Gatchina and that no one here knew anything about them, we decided to proceed 
farther, to Luga, and if necessary to Pskoff. But to undertake such a long 
journey on a wet, autumn road without reserve tires and sufficient gasoline was 
unthinkable. We resolved to spend a half hour at the commandant's office, to 
have some tea and warm up, while our machines were to be taken to the garage of 
the local military automobile command to take on the necessary materials. 
However, the moment I stepped into the commandant's office his conduct appeared 
very strange to me. He tried to speak as loudly as possible and kept close to an 
open door leading into an adjacent room, from where we were being closely eyed 
by some soldiers. As if responding to the warning of some inner voice I suddenly 
ordered my machine detained and proposed to my companions that we resume the 
journey at once, without waiting for tea. Only the car with the American flag 
and one officer went to the garage for the necessaries.</p>

<p class="fst">We had left in time. Five minutes after our departure a machine 
all decorated with red flags raced into the palace yard; members of the local 
military-revolutionary committee had come to arrest me. It developed that some 
traitors in the staff building in Petrograd had informed Smolny of my departure 
for Gatchina. From Smolny had come an order to have me arrested here. Our 
automobile managed, however, to escape from the city. But our other machine fell 
into serious difficulty. For more than an hour it wandered about the streets of 
Gatchina. After breaking through two ambushes, under a hail of shots, it found 
escape from the third ambush not quite so easy. One bullet pierced a tire and 
another struck the chauffeur in the hand. My officer, deserting the machine, was 
compelled to seek refuge in a near-by wood. We learned of this only next day, on 
our return to Gatchina from the front.</p>

<p class="fst">But on leaving Gatchina we counted only the minutes, jumping with 
every jerk of the machine, trembling for the fate of our tires. There is no use 
to describe in detail our mad hunt for the elusive echelons from the front, 
which we did not find until our arrival at Pskoff.</p>

<p class="fst">When we entered that city at nine o'clock in the evening we knew 
nothing of what had possibly taken place here. Nor had we any knowledge of the 
extent to which the people were familiar with events in Petrograd, or of how 
these events had been received here. For this reason we decided to move with 
great care and instead of going directly to the Staff Headquarters of the 
Commander of the Northern Front, General Tcheremisoff, we went to the home of 
his quarter-master-general, Baranoffsky, formerly chief of my military cabinet. 
Here I learned that the news from Petrograd was very discouraging, that a 
Bolshevist military-revolutionary committee was already functioning in Pskoff 
itself, and that it had telegraphed an order for my arrest, signed by Lieutenant 
Krilenko and the sailor, Dybenko. In addition, I learned what was even worse, 
namely, that Tcheremisoff himself was making all sorts of advances to the 
revolutionary committee and that he would not take any measures for the dispatch 
of troops to Petrograd, believing anv such expedition to be useless and 
detrimental.</p>

<p class="fst">Soon, upon my order, the commander himself appeared. A very 
unpleasant conversation followed. The general did not conceal his intention of 
not binding his fate in any way with that of the "doomed" government. He also 
tried to show that he had no troops he could spare from the front, and declared 
that he could not guarantee my personal safety in Pskoff. Tcheremisoff informed 
me also that he had countermanded the order, given in response to my demand from 
Petrograd, for the dispatch of troops, the Third Cavalry Corps included.</p>

<p class="fst">"Have you seen General Krassnoff? Does he share your opinion?" I 
asked.</p>

<p class="fst">"I expect General Krassnoff any minute from Ostroff."</p>

<p class="fst">"In that case, general, direct him to me at once."</p>

<p class="fst">"I obey."</p>

<p class="fst">The general left, saying he was going straight to a meeting of 
the Military-Revolutionary Committee to get a clear idea of the attitude of the 
troops and that he would come back to me to report. My conversation with this 
clever, able, extremely vain man, who had so completely forgotten the call of 
duty, made a disgusting impression upon me. Considerably later I learned that 
upon leaving me the general did not go to a meeting of the 
Military-Revolutionary Committee. He even tried, by long distance wire, to 
prevail upon General Baliayeff, commander of the Western Front, not to give any 
aid to the government.</p>

<p class="fst">Tcheremisoff's absence seemed endless. Meanwhile every minute was 
costly, for every delay meant irreparable damage in Petrograd. It was 11 P.M. 
How could we in Pskoff know that at that very moment the Winter Palace, where 
the Provisional Government was sitting, was withstanding the final bombardment 
and the last attacks of the Bolsheviki? Finally, at one o'clock in the morning, 
General Tcheremisoff returned to declare that he could not give any aid to the 
government. And if, he continued, I still held to my conviction that resistance 
was necessary, I should go immediately to Mohileff, as my arrest here, in 
Pskoff, was inevitable. In mentioning Mohileff, General Tcheremisoff did not, 
however, tell me that General Dukhonin, chief-of-staff at General Headquarters, 
had tried twice to speak to me by long distance wire and that twice Tcheremisoff 
had refused to permit him to do so, without asking me.</p>

<p class="fst">"And Krassnoff?" I asked.</p>

<p class="fst">"He has already been here and gone back to Ostroff."</p>

<p class="fst">"But, look here, General, didn't I ask you to send</p>

<p class="fst">Krassnoff to me?"</p>

<p class="fst">As far as I can recall there was no answer to this exclamation. 
His criminal shirking of his duty was obvious and I was in a hurry to get rid of 
him. For there was no hesitation in my mind. 1 felt I must return to Petrograd, 
even if only with one regiment. After considering the situation with General 
Baranoffsky and my young companions, I decided to proceed immediately to 
Ostroff, Staff Headquarters of the Third Cossack Cavalry Corps and, in the event 
of failure there, to continue to Mohileff. While waiting for my automobile I lay 
down to rest. In the silence of the night I could almost hear the onward 
lightning-like rush of the seconds, and the realization that every passing 
moment was bringing everything closer to the abyss was unbearable.</p>

<p class="fst">Suddenly, a ring at the main door! It was Krassnoff with his 
chief-of-staff. He wanted to see me at once. At one jump I was in the room where 
the two officers awaited me. It appeared that having received from General 
Tcheremisoff an order, signed ostensibly by me, countermanding the move on 
Petrograd, which had already been begun, General Krassnoff somehow doubted the 
authenticity of the order, and instead of leaving for Ostroff he had begun to 
look for me here in the night.</p>

<p class="fst">"And I, general, was just making ready to go to you, to Ostroff, 
relying on your corps and hoping, regardless of obstacles, to march on 
Petrograd."</p>

<p class="fst">It was decided that we would immediately go together to Ostroff, 
with the idea of moving on the capital the same morning, with whatever forces we 
could muster. At this point it is necessary to stop for a moment in order that 
all the fatal events that followed may be made clearer. It is necessary to stop 
and recall the past history of the Third Corps, with which it pleased fate to 
bind my last effort to save the country from Bolshevist destruction. The Third 
Cavalry Corps was the very same celebrated corps which together with the "Wild 
Division," under command of General Krimoff, had been hurled against the 
Provisional Government by General Korniloff on September seventh. After the 
collapse of the rebellion the "demoralized" parts of this corps had been 
scattered all over the Northern Front. That was why instead of a corps I found 
only several regiments in Ostroff. On the other hand, the participation of the 
corps in the Korniloff adventure had seriously lowered its spirits, shattered 
its military discipline and sowed mistrust of the officers on the part of the 
Cossack rank and file. The officers, on their part, could not reconcile 
themselves to the collapse of the Korniloff enterprise and hated all its 
opponents, particularly me.</p>

<p class="fst">General Krassnoff himself conducted himself, in his relations 
with me, with great but proper restraint. In general, he was all the time 
holding back much that he would have liked to say. However, I did get the 
impression immediately that he was ready to do all he could to crush the 
Bolshevist mutiny. Moreover, not in vain did it please fate to make it possible 
for me to continue the struggle by pushing Krassnoff to my side. Late in the 
night we left for Ostroff, arriving there at dawn. The order stopping the move 
on Petrograd was in turn recalled.</p>

<p class="fst">The advance on Petrograd was announced. We did not know then that 
the government, to whose aid we were rushing, was already in the hands of the 
Bolsheviki and that the ministers themselves were in the Fortress of SS. Peter 
and Paul. But we could see how quickly events in Petrograd reacted on the front, 
destroying everywhere all the discipline and order barely restored anew after 
the Korniloff affair. We had hardly entered Ostroff when we began to hear 
reports on all sides that the local garrison had decided to use force to prevent 
the Cossacks from leaving the town. In the morning, addressing a meeting of 
garrison and Cossack delegates, at the request of General Krassnoff, I had 
opportunity to convince myself that every hour's delay in the town made the 
departure of the Cossacks from Ostroff increasingly more problematical. 
Gradually, the soldier mass, disorderly and partly armed, gathered in increasing 
numbers around the Staff Headquarters of the Third Corps.</p>

<p class="fst">At last, at about ten o'clock in the morning, we received word 
from the railway station that the military trains were ready for the entrainment 
of the troops. Our automobiles moved to the station under a Cossack convoy, to 
the accompaniment of the threatening cries of the infuriated soldiery. At the 
station new difficulties developed. Under various excuses, with the object of 
paralyzing our enterprise, our trains were not permitted to pass. Only my 
personal presence among the troops finally removed all apparent and concealed 
obstacles. With much delay, the trains loaded with the echelons of the Third 
Cavalry Corps moved on their journey.</p>

<p class="fst">The entire "fighting force" of the corps consisted of five or six 
hundred Cossacks and several cannon. However, with these forces and at any cost 
we decided to fight our way to Petrograd, without awaiting any reenforcements or 
stopping anywhere.</p>

<p class="fst">Only towards evening of that day, in the train, near Luga, did I 
receive the first report of the capture of the Winter Palace. The report was 
brought to me by special courier from General Baranoffsky at Pskoff, who in turn 
had received it by direct telephone communication from the telegraph station at 
the Winter Palace through an officer of my military cabinet. Although based 
apparently on unimpeachable authority it appeared to us, as often happens in 
life, improbable, while the courier from Pskoff himself roused our suspicion. 
For with us in the train was an officer who had left Petrograd on the morning of 
November eighth. According to him the government was at that time still 
defending itself while resistance to the Bolsheviki was increasing in the city. 
Comparing this testimony of the "eyewitness" with the report from Pskoff, we 
involuntarily questioned the authenticity of the latter, believing the tragic 
information to have been fabricated by a Bolshevist agent in order to provoke 
panic and demoralization in the ranks of the government forces. And however 
difficult, almost hopeless, may have been the position of Petrograd on the 
morning of November seventh, at the hour of our departure, it still seemed to us 
improbable that at two o'clock in the morning, on November eighth, the 
Bolsheviki could already be masters of the palace and of Staff Headquarters.</p>

<p class="fst">At dawn, on November ninth, our detachment was approaching 
Gatchina, which was by this time already in the hands of the Bolsheviki, under 
the authority of the local military-revolutionary committee and of the local 
Soviet. The town was filled with all kinds of Bolshevist troops&#8212;local infantry, 
artillery, Kronstadt sailors, armored cars from Petrograd, etc. Despite the 
overwhelming numerical superiority of the "enemy" we decided to capture the town 
at once. We unloaded our troops and the military operations began. These 
operations were concluded quickly and brilliantly. Almost without firing a shot 
and, as I recall, without any losses, the government "forces" captured Gatchina. 
The "revolutionary" troops fled in all directions or surrendered together with 
their rifles, guns, hand grenades, etc. In their hurried retreat they even left 
behind an armored car. At about four o'clock in the afternoon, accompanied by 
all my companions, I was again entering the office of the commandant, from which 
less than two days before I had made my timely and fortunate departure.</p>

<p class="fst">In preparing the military operations that followed, I did not, of 
course, assume the direction of the military-technical side of the task, 
appointing General Krassnoff commander of all the armed forces of the Petrograd 
district. I was prepared, however, to support him at any point at which his 
personal authority might prove inadequate.</p>

<p class="fst">The first prerequisite of continued success was the arrival of 
reenforcements from the front, especially of infantry. From Gatchina I sent out 
many telegrams demanding the dispatch of troops. From many sections of the front 
I received replies that the troops were either already on the way or were about 
to leave. According to our calculations, based on official data, the first 
echelon of infantry was due to arrive in Gatchina towards evening of November 
ninth. We were particularly in need of infantry, as it was difficult to develop 
our operations with only the cavalry and artillery at our disposal. The Cossacks 
of the Third Corps, remembering the bitter experience of the Korniloff 
expedition, were eagerly awaiting the arrival of other soldiers. Our appearance 
at Gatchina had brought into the town a considerable number of officers who 
aroused the suspicion of the Cossacks, all the more so because these officers 
gave expression to sentiments quite reactionary.</p>

<p class="fst">Despite the insignificance of the forces at our disposal, we 
decided not to halt our advance on Petrograd pending the arrival of 
reenforcements from the front, for we were convinced that the first echelons 
would surely reach Gatchina by evening of November tenth. Moreover, it was 
necessary to take full advantage of the demoralizing effect produced on the 
Bolsheviki by our speedy return from the front and the capture of Gatchina. It 
should be remembered that no one really knew the exact number of bayonets and 
guns at our disposal.</p>

<p class="fst">In Petrograd the impression in both friendly and hostile circles 
was that our troops were numbered in thousands! Our policy of "speed and 
pressure" was, moreover, made imperative by the general condition of the country 
and, particularly, of the front. The trump card of the Bolsheviki was peace, 
peace, immediate peace! Having seized the central telegraph station in Petrograd 
on the night of November eighth and the most powerful Russian wireless station 
at Tsarskoye Selo, the Bolsheviki had begun immediately disseminating throughout 
the front their appeals for peace, arousing the weary troops, provoking their 
elemental demobilization and rush for home and stimulating fraternization with 
the enemy. It was necessary to destroy all communications between the Bolsheviki 
in Petrograd and the front and to stop the stream of poisonous propaganda coming 
over the wires and the radio. We felt that in eight or ten days it would be too 
late and the entire country would be overwhelmed by the masses of soldiery 
streaming from the front. There was no other way out. It was necessary to act, 
however great and mad the risk.</p>

<p class="fst">Incidentally, I may say that the legend that the Provisional 
Government disappeared from the face of the earth amidst general indifference is 
in no way borne out by the facts. Simultaneously with our advance on Petrograd, 
civil war broke out all over the country and at the front. The heroic uprising 
of the military cadets in Petrograd on November eleventh, the street battles in 
Moscow, Saratoff, Kharkoff and other cities, the battles at the front between 
troops loyal to the Revolution and Bolshevist units&#8212;all these show conclusively 
that we were not alone in our final stand.</p>

<p class="fst">And so, making Gatchina our base and taking stock of our forces 
and all possible reenforcements, we decided to move on Tsarskoye at dawn of 
November tenth, intending to capture it by noon of the same day.</p>

<p class="fst">General Krassnoff himself was full of courage and confidence, 
believing that he would not require reenforcements until after the capture of 
Tsarskoye Selo, when the direct operations against Petrograd would begin. The 
attitude of the Cossacks on that day, November ninth, was still quite 
satisfactory. At dawn, on November tenth, the Cossacks moved from Gatchina and 
soon their ranks were advancing along the Tsarskoselsky <i>chaussée</i>. On the 
same morning we received our first reenforcement: a splendidly equipped armored 
train, abundantly supplied with guns and light quick-firing field pieces.</p>

<p class="fst">But already on that morning we began to be worried by the delay 
in the advance of the echelons from the front. This delay appeared quite strange 
and mysterious. Later, we learned the reasons for it. On the one hand, we were 
being sabotaged by various military authorities, like the aforementioned 
Tcheremisoff, and, on the other, railroad and telegraph workers were hindering 
the troop trains going in the direction of Gatchina.</p>

<p class="fst">About three hours after the departure of our forces, I followed 
them in an automobile. I found the Cossacks at a place where I did not expect 
them to be. They were not advancing at the rate of speed expected of them, and 
it soon became clear that they would not reach Tsarskoye Selo by noon.</p>

<p class="fst">Observing strictly my rule not to interfere in actual military 
operations, I stopped halfway between Gatchina and Tsarskoye Selo, at the 
Meteorological Observatory at Pulkovo, from the dome of which the battlefield 
was clearly visible through field glasses. Here I learned that the Bolsheviki 
had apparently organized some kind of resistance near Tsarskoye Selo and that 
General Krassnoff, following an artillery bombardment, was attacking the town.</p>

<p class="fst">Indeed, very soon after our arrival at the observatory we heard a 
short cannonade. Then everything grew still. Time passed quickly. The silence 
was unbroken. There was no information from General Krassnoff. Finally, I grew 
tired of waiting and left for the point of concentration of the government 
troops.</p>

<p class="fst">General Krassnoff reported that the delay was due to the 
organization of the defense of Tsarskoye Selo, which was more thorough than he 
had expected, and to the insignificant forces at our disposal.</p>

<p class="fst">Continuing this conversation, General Krassnoff adopted a rather 
new attitude towards me. At the conclusion of the conversation he suddenly asked 
me rather hesitatingly not to remain on the battlefield, explaining in no 
particularly convincing manner that my presence was interfering with the 
military operations and was disturbing the officers. All this mystified me 
greatly. I could not understand it, until ... I observed in his
<i>entourage</i> a number of very familiar figures from the Council of Cossack 
Troops. It developed that the council had sent a special delegation to General 
Krassnoff. I thereupon understood all too clearly General Krassnoff's changed 
manner and attitude. I had not forgotten the conduct of the Cossack regiments in 
Petrograd on the night of November sixth, remembering their suspicious 
neutrality instigated by the propaganda of the very same Cossack Council. The 
appearance of politicians and intriguers from the Cossack Council had already 
made itself felt in my detachment and boded no good. My suspicion was aggravated 
when on my return to the observatory, after my conversation with General 
Krassnoff, I was overtaken by Savinkoff.</p>

<p class="fst">Savinkoff in my detachment as a delegate of the Cossack Council! 
This was and for a long time remained a riddle to me. It was difficult to 
realize how Savinkoff had suddenly gained the confidence of the Cossack Council, 
which had remained loyal to Korniloff to the last. On his own insistent plea, 
Savinkoff had been appointed by me commander of Petrograd, in the defense of the 
capital against Korniloff, and had openly denounced Korniloff as a traitor. And 
now he was the representative of the same Cossack Council that was so bitterly 
hostile to the Provisional Government and to me in particular.</p>

<p class="fst">On the appearance in the small room of the observatory of this 
most peculiar Cossack I realized in a flash the entire new situation in my 
detachment. I realized immediately that the appearance of this "delegation" 
would not pass without serious effect on my undertaking.</p>

<p class="fst">Time passed. The sun was already in the west. I managed to make 
another trip to Gatchina to attend to some urgent business, but there was no 
news about a "determined advance" on Tsarskoye Selo. Thereupon I again returned 
to our troops, planning this time to interfere directly in the military 
operations. I was no longer in doubt that the sudden paralysis that had befallen 
the troops was not of military-technical but of purely political origin.</p>

<p class="fst">I found General Krassnoff and his men already in the very suburbs 
of the town but observed not the slightest indication of military action. On the 
contrary, between the "besieging" and the "besiegers" some kind of endless 
conversations were in progress concerning "voluntary" capitulation, surrender of 
arms, etc. On learning the situation I sent General Krassnoff a written demand 
for immediate active operations against Tsarskoye Selo by opening artillery 
fire.</p>

<p class="fst">The general replied that his forces were inadequate and that, in 
addition, the hesitation and extremely disturbed attitude of the Cossacks 
compelled him to refrain from decisive measures. It was evident Krassnoff was 
not in a hurry. I still am absolutely convinced that with proper good will on 
the part of the command and with the absence of intrigue, we would have occupied 
Tsarskoye Selo in the morning, twelve hours before it was actually occupied, <i>
i.e.</i>, before the crushing of the military cadets in Petrograd.</p>

<p class="fst">As will be seen later, this deliberate delay at Tsarskoye Selo 
was a fatal blow to our entire expedition.</p>

<p class="fst">Late in the evening, General Krassnoff, continuing to delay the 
bombardment, reported to me his intention to withdraw his troops some distance, 
postponing the capture of Tsarskoye Selo until the morrow. This was too much. 
Under no circumstances could I give my assent to such a move.</p>

<p class="fst">First, I saw no obstacles to the immediate occupation of 
Tsarskoye Selo; second, I believed it highly dangerous to create an impression 
of our weakness and uncertainty in the military operations. At that very time 
there arrived from Petrograd the army commissar at General Headquarters, 
Stankevitch, whose report strengthened my determination in my differences with 
General Krassnoff.</p>

<p class="fst">Stankevitch, reporting on the situation in the capital and the 
forces ready to support us there, insisted on speeding up our advance on 
Petrograd. Finally, it was decided to occupy Tsarskoye Selo at once. As was to 
have been expected, our detachment entered the town about midnight, seizing the 
city without any difficulty. This could have been achieved with equal success 
twelve hours earlier.</p>

<p class="fst">I returned to Gatchina for the night in a mood of utmost 
dejection and misgiving. The experiences of the day had shown that the men in 
command of our detachment were already in the web of intrigue, that many of them 
had lost consideration for the welfare of the country. I saw no escape from the 
situation except through surrounding and disarming the Cossack detachment as 
speedily as possible by other troops. These troops I confidently hoped to find 
in Gatchina and move them on Tsarskoye Selo. In Gatchina I found only telegrams. 
Meanwhile, in our absence, the situation at Gatchina had taken a sharp turn for 
the worse, due, particularly, to the effects of the pressure of Bolshevist 
forces on the right flank (in the direction of Oranienbaum and Krassnoye Selo), 
the Bolshevist forces consisting principally of naval detachments.</p>

<p class="fst">The uncertainty of the situation, the absence of exact 
information, the mass of rumors created extreme nervousness and tension in the 
town, particularly towards night. Panic threatened to ensue at any moment.</p>

<p class="fst">On the very same night of November eleventh and on the morning of 
the following day a tragic and bloody misunderstanding developed in Petrograd. 
At that time there were still sufficient forces in the Petrograd garrison, both 
in the regular regiments and in special units, ready at the first opportune 
moment to move against the Bolsheviki. Adding to these the cadets of the 
military schools, nearly all of which were preparing for action, there were 
still very considerable forces in Petrograd able to deal a decisive blow in the 
rear of the Bolshevist troops facing our detachment at Pulkowo. In addition, all 
the military units of the respective parties, especially that of the 
Socialist-Revolutionists, had finally been mobilized by this time. But due to 
misunderstanding of the confused situation and the misleading activity of
<i>agents-provocateurs</i> and traitors, all the anti-Bolshevist forces in 
Petrograd had gone into action too soon, before we could be of any assistance to 
them or, at any rate, before we could take advantage of the fighting in 
Petrograd to attack the Bolshevist forces at Pulkowo.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course, had we been properly informed of the developments in 
the capital, I would have demanded immediate supporting action on our part. The 
whole horror of the situation lay in the fact that not only was the action of 
our forces in Petrograd, provoked by <i>agents-provocateurs</i>, premature, but 
that we knew nothing about it all that day. Only late in the afternoon, at about 
four o'clock, when all was over, was I summoned to the telephone by the 
Mikhailowsky Castle and informed of the defeat of our forces in Petrograd. 
Accompanying the information was a plea for help.</p>

<p class="fst">But what could I do now? How could Petrograd venture to rise 
without contact with the army? This question threw me into despair and anger.</p>

<p class="fst">Late at night some political friends arrived in Gatchina from 
Petrograd and brought the answer to this terrible question. It developed that, 
according to the plan of our supporters, our forces in Petrograd were to go into 
action at the proper moment, in full cooperation with the military operations of 
our detachment advancing on the capital. At a meeting of our leaders in 
Petrograd, on the evening of November tenth, no resolution concerning immediate 
action had been adopted. Active operations were decided upon later, after 
adjournment of the meeting, when the majority of the participants had already 
departed. At that moment a group of military men, highly excited, appeared at 
the place of the meeting with the hardly reliable information that the 
Bolsheviki, having learned of the contemplated action, had decided to begin the 
disarmament of the military schools next morning and for this reason it was 
necessary to take risks and begin operations immediately. And, indeed, the 
morning of November eleventh opened with a cannonade, the meaning and purpose of 
which were at first a mystery to the majority of the civilian and military 
leaders of the anti-Bolshevist movement in Petrograd. The <i>provocateurs</i> 
had been completely successful in their aim. Our own detachment could no longer 
hope for any assistance from Petrograd, while the Bolshevist forces facing us 
were greatly encouraged.</p>

<p class="fst">At this point I must emphasize the conduct of the Cossack 
regiments in Petrograd throughout the tragic uprising of our forces on November 
eleventh. Although the Cossacks had given me their solemn promise to do their 
duty they continued throughout the fighting, as they did on the night of 
November eighth, "saddling their horses." These Cossack regiments remained true 
to themselves. Despite their promise, ignoring the horrors in the streets of 
Petrograd, when the military cadets and their civilian supporters were being 
shot and drowned in the Neva by the hundreds, the Cossacks remained "neutral." 
Old Tchaikovsky, accompanied, I think, by Avksentieff, made the round of the 
barracks, pleading for help from the Cossacks. According to the testimony of 
participants in the fighting, Colonel Polkovnikoff and his associates remained 
faithful to their policy of permitting the Bolsheviki to smash the Provisional 
Government and the democracy they so hated, in order to establish afterwards a 
strong "national" dictatorship.</p>

<p class="fst">But let us return to Tsarskoye Selo. The entire day of November 
eleventh was devoted to preparations for battle, which was to begin at dawn on 
Monday, November twelfth. The Bolshevist lines ran along the heights of Pulkowo. 
On their right flank was Krassnoye Selo, from which they were in a position to 
undertake a flanking movement against Gatchina.</p>

<p class="fst">The reports of our scouts showed that we were faced by 12,000 to 
15,000 troops of various branches. The heights of Pulkowo were occupied by 
Kronstadt sailors, splendidly trained, as we learned later, by German 
instructors. We had several hundred (600-700) Cossacks, a limited quantity of 
artillery of excellent quality, an armored train and a regiment of infantry, 
which had meanwhile arrived from Luga. Not much! To be sure, we had also heaps 
of telegrams informing us of the approach of additional echelons. About fifty 
military trains from many sections of the front were fighting their way towards 
Gatchina against all obstacles. But it was impossible to delay any further. The 
Bolshevist command was feverishly assembling its forces, preparing to take the 
offensive at any moment.</p>

<p class="fst">Early in the morning, November twelfth, the fight at Pulkowo 
began. In general it was developing satisfactorily. The great portion of the 
Bolshevist forces, consisting of troops of the Petrograd garrison, deserted 
their positions as soon as our artillery opened fire and under the slightest 
pressure of our men. But the right flank of the Bolsheviki held fast. Here the 
Kronstadt sailors and their German instructors were in action. The report 
presented to me in the evening of that day by General Krassnoff stated that the 
sailors were fighting in accordance with all the rules of German tactics and 
that among the prisoners taken by us were men who spoke only German, or Russian 
with a foreign accent. The fight at Pulkowo was concluded in the evening 
successfully for us, but we could not follow up this "success" by pursuit or 
consolidate it because of the insignificant numbers at our disposal. Towards 
evening, General Krassnoff retreated to Gatchina. At about eight o'clock in the 
evening, General Krassnoff and his staff, accompanied by his weary troops, 
entered the gates of the Gatchina Palace.</p>

<p class="fst">From the military point of view, this maneuver was quite proper 
and reasonable. But in the tense, political atmosphere of the situation this 
retreat provoked complete demoralization in the ranks of the government forces. 
It meant the beginning of the end!</p>

<p class="fst">Before I describe these last thirty-six hours of our agony let us 
return to the picture presented by our detachment before the battle at Tsarskoye 
Selo. This will explain more clearly the psychology of the final events at 
Gatchina. Unfortunately, all the negative aspects of the situation at Gatchina 
had attained full bloom at Tsarskoye. On the one hand, our handful of Cossacks 
was virtually lost in the mass of the local garrison. Everywhere&#8212;in the park 
avenues, in the streets, at the barrack gates&#8212;meetings were in progress, with 
agitators doing their best to confuse and discourage our men. The main argument 
of the propaganda consisted in comparing my expedition) with Korniloff's: "Once 
more, comrades, as under the Czar and under Korniloff, you are being compelled 
to shoot down peasants and workmen in order that the landlords, the bourgeoisie 
and the generals may be returned to power." The rank and file of the Cossacks 
did not long remain indifferent to this demagogic agitation and began looking 
askance at the commanders. And at the same time, the commanders, without 
exception, from the highest staff officers to the very last noncommissioned 
officer, having forgotten their duty, were devoting themselves to playing 
politics. The local irreconcilable Kornilovites, supporting those who had come 
from Petrograd, began "working" openly among the officers, fanning confusion, 
stimulating hatred towards the Provisional Government and demanding my head. 
Indications of treason were clearly discernible in the atmosphere of intrigue.</p>

<p class="fst">My presence in our detachment was regarded by members of the 
staff as detrimental to our "success," etc. I did not wish to interfere with our 
success, but I could not abandon the fight against the Bolsheviki. To sit idle 
at Gatchina was likewise not particularly pleasant and, what is more, it was 
useless. This was how I viewed the situation at Tsarskoye Selo on the night of 
November twelfth. I decided to go immediately to meet the echelons supposed to 
be approaching from the front. I had hoped also by my personal presence to 
accelerate their advance, as I did in the case of the Cossacks at Ostroff, and 
to deliver the infantry reenforcements in time to Krassnoff. As far as I 
remember, I sent a note to Krassnoff, in the morning of November twelfth, 
informing him of my departure from Tsarskoye Selo.</p>

<p class="fst">Great was my surprise when a short time later a delegation of the 
Cossack Council, headed by Savinkoff, appeared before me! They informed me, in 
the name of the entire detachment, that my departure was most undesirable, that 
it was likely to produce a bad effect on the rank and file of the Cossacks and, 
therefore, on the progress of the battle, and, finally, as the Cossacks had come 
here with me I must share their fate with them. In reply, I explained to the 
delegates the purpose of my journey, emphasizing that I considered the journey 
possible only because yesterday's conduct on the part of Krassnoff and his staff 
had convinced me that I had become superfluous here. And if this was not so, I 
said, if my departure was likely to interfere with the success of the fight, I 
was, of course, ready to remain, on condition that the Cossacks remain loyal to 
the Provisional Government.</p>

<p class="fst">The interview was concluded. I remained in Gatchina, to which, as 
I have already pointed out, the entire detachment returned in the evening.</p>

<p class="fst">In Gatchina itself the report of "the retreat of Kerensky's 
troops" spread with lightning-like speed long before the return of the Cossacks, 
producing panic among some and doubling the energy and audacity of others. In 
the evening, shortly before the return of Krassnoff, a delegation of the 
All-Russian Executive Committee of the Union Railwaymen came to me from 
Petrograd with a brazen ultimatum, demanding on the threat of a railway strike 
that I enter into peace negotiations with the Bolsheviki. I was called upon to 
reply within a few hours. A stormy scene followed. The treason of the Railway 
Union rendered our situation nothing short of tragic, for a railway strike, 
without affecting in any way the movement of Bolshevist armed forces (already 
concentrated in Petrograd, with their reserves deployed along the Baltic coast) 
would have cut us off from all fronts and from all advancing reenforcements.</p>

<p class="fst">It was imperative to organize as speedily as possible the defense 
of Gatchina against possible blows from the direction of Krassnoye Selo and 
Oranienbaum. To do this had become, however, well-nigh impossible, despite the 
concentration of an enormous number of officers in the town. All of them 
preferred to while away their time at the palace, at Staff Headquarters, 
discussing the situation, quarreling and criticizing everything and everybody. 
On General Krassnoff's arrival I informed him of the Railway Union's ultimatum. 
Krassnoff expressed the opinion that under the circumstances it would perhaps be 
wise to begin armistice negotiations, in order to gain time. This, he said, 
would tend to pacify, to some extent, the Cossacks, who had begun to look with 
increasing suspicion on the commanders, and would give us a breathing space, 
pending the arrival of reenforcements.</p>

<p class="fst">The Cossacks had begun to lose all hope of the arrival of these 
infantry reenforcements. In vain were our efforts in showing them heaps of 
telegrams concerning the movements of the echelons; in vain did we seek to prove 
to them that the reenforcements were actually coming and that we had not very 
long to wait. In vain! The Cossacks were paying ever increasing attention to the 
speeches of agitators, being inclined to regard our assurances with ever 
decreasing credulity and showing a growing impatience and distrust with respect 
to the officers.</p>

<p class="fst">On the same evening of November twelfth, taking advantage of the 
arrival of a group of friends from Petrograd, I gave them a letter addressed to 
N. D. Avksentieff, President of the Council of the Republic, transferring to 
him, in the event of "possible necessity," the rights and duties of premier of 
the Provisional Government, suggesting also the immediate filling of vacancies.</p>

<p class="fst">I had hardly completed this task when I was informed that a 
meeting of the officers in Gatchina desired emphatically that I appoint 
Savinkoff commander of the defense of the town, that they trusted him and that 
they would immediately begin organizing the defense. I appointed Savinkoff to 
the post, which was utilized the same night by the Bolsheviki as new evidence of 
my "counter-revolutionism."</p>

<p class="fst">Only late at night did I find myself alone, with my two young 
adjutants, Lieutenant Kovanko and Lieutenant Vinner, who remained faithful to me 
to the last. It was now possible for me to think of my own fate, which did not 
appear particularly uncertain. One of my adjutants had just become a father. 
After much difficulty I prevailed upon him to leave me at the first opportunity, 
which presented itself very soon. The other, nineteen-year-old Vinner, who had 
stuck to me throughout the Revolution, declined flatly to yield to all 
importunities. We decided to meet all eventualities together. At that moment we 
already felt that we were moving quickly towards the inevitable.</p>

<p class="fst">In the morning, November thirteenth, I summoned a military 
council. Present were General Krassnoff; Colonel Popoff, his chief-of-staff; 
Captain Kuzmin, assistant commander of the troops of the Petrograd military 
district; Savinkoff, Stankevitch and another member of the staff. Opening the 
meeting, I presented a brief summary of the political situation as it appeared 
on the basis of the information at my disposal and, then, requested the 
chief-of-staff to explain the military situation and to report on the movement 
of the troops. After that I put the question of the acceptance or rejection of 
an armistice before the council. The opinions were given in the order of 
seniority, the youngest present speaking first. Only two opinions&#8212; Savinkoff's 
and mine&#8212;were in favor of unconditional refusal of any negotiations. All the 
military men present were unanimous in the view that it was necessary to start 
negotiations immediately, as otherwise it was impossible to guarantee the 
behavior of the Cossacks.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus, the opinion of the majority was clearly evident: however 
difficult and unpleasant the task was, there was no other way out; it was 
necessary to gain time by negotiations. In addition, I felt it was impossible to 
permit Krassnoff and his staff to say to the Cossacks: "We were for peace but 
Kerensky ordered us to fight." I confirmed the opinion of the majority and the 
military council began working out the technical conditions of the negotiations.</p>

<p class="fst">It was decided that Stankevitch go to Petrograd by detour, to 
inform the Committee for the Salvation of the Motherland and the Revolution of 
my armistice conditions. I regret that I cannot recall the full text of this 
document, of which I did not retain a copy. At any rate, these conditions were 
unacceptable to the Bolsheviki, who following our departure from Tsarskoye Selo 
had had little doubt of their ultimate success. But I remember clearly two of my 
conditions: first, the immediate laying down of arms by the Bolsheviki and their 
promise to obey the Provisional Government, which was to be reorganized; and, 
second, the reorganization of the government and its program to be determined by 
agreement of the existing Provisional Government with the representatives of all 
the political parties and the Committee for the Salvation of the Motherland and 
the Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">At about four o'clock in the afternoon Stankevitch left for 
Petrograd. By this time General Krassnoff had organized a delegation to go to 
Krassnoye Selo, Bolshevist headquarters, to conclude an immediate armistice, 
pending the result of Stankevitch's mission. The delegation left for Bolshevist 
headquarters only in the evening. It consisted only of Cossacks, as Captain 
Kuzmin categorically declined to accompany the delegation, despite the 
importunities of Krassnoff.</p>

<p class="fst">Before that, early in the afternon, following the adjournment of 
the military council, Savinkoff had come to me with a paper in his hand. I 
thought his visit had something to do with some urgent question concerning the 
defense of Gatchina. I was mistaken. The paper stated that the bearer, Boris 
Savinkoff, was commissiond by Kerensky, Premier and Commander-in-Chief, to go to 
General Headquarters to facilitate the dispatch of reenforcements to Gatchina.</p>

<p class="fst">"Please sign this paper, Alexander Feodorovitch; I want to go."</p>

<p class="fst">"Go ahead," I replied, returning the signed commission, although 
Savinkoff's journey to General Headquarters was quite unreasonable, and although 
he was abandoning the very responsible task he had undertaken in Gatchina and 
towards the execution of which he had not yet done a single thing.</p>

<p class="fst">Both of us understood the purpose of his departure and it would 
have been useless to discuss it. Savinkoff's wise foresight served only to 
emphasize the atmosphere that surrounded me! Only by a miracle, only by the 
utmost self-sacrifice of the few defenders of Gatchina could the situation now 
be saved. But not even the impending grave peril served to unite us, to rouse 
energy and initiative; on the contrary it only stimulated and added poison to 
the disintegration. For the majority, self-preservation became the first 
consideration. The Cossacks looked with increasing anger upon their officers as 
the cause of their impending destruction, while the officers, under the hostile 
pressure of the Bolshevist soldiery and of their own Cossacks, began to think 
more frequently at what price they could buy their own lives from the Bolsheviki 
in the event of the fall of Gatchina. Because of the continued delay in the 
arrival of reenforcements the Cossacks honestly believed themselves betrayed. 
The officers considered it no longer necessary to conceal their hatred for me, 
feeling that I was no longer able to protect them from the fury of the mob.</p>

<p class="fst">Thus began the night of November thirteenth. No reports from the 
parliamentarians "at the front." No information from Petrograd. The half-dark, 
gloomy, endless corridors of the old palace, built by Emperor Paul I, are filled 
with masses of aroused, infuriated people. The air, poisoned by fear, is filled 
with most improbable, monstrous rumors. Everywhere there is whispering: "If the 
Cossacks will voluntarily surrender Kerensky they will be permitted to return to 
their homes, on the quiet Don." The temptation is too great; the thought of 
betrayal captures the minds of many. It seems as if the long autumn night will 
never end. The minutes appear like hours. The rats are deserting the sinking 
ship. There is not a soul in my rooms, only yesterday filled to capacity. There 
is only gravelike silence and calm. We are alone. There are very few of us. We 
have stuck together all these months, united by a common fate. Nothing hinders 
us now from thinking quietly and undisturbedly of what is impending. Daylight 
had already broken when, after destroying all the papers and letters which could 
not very well be permitted to fall into "strange hands," I lay down on the bed 
and dozed off with but one thought: "Will the echelons arrive in the morning?"</p>

<p class="fst">At about ten o'clock I was awakened suddenly. A most unexpected 
report: the Cossack-parliamentarians headed by Dybenko! The basic demand of the 
sailors was the unconditional surrender of Kerensky to the Bolsheviki. The 
Cossacks were prepared to accept the condition.</p>

<p class="fst">The report was quite surprising! To the very last moment, despite 
all the suspicious indications and dark forebodings, we had refused to admit the 
possibility of such contemptible treason. But the fact was undeniable!</p>

<p class="fst">There remained but one thing to do: to have a showdown with 
General Krassnoff and his staff, to clear up the question of whether or not they 
themselves were involved in the betrayal. I sent immediately for the general. He 
appeared, most correct and all too calm in his bearing.</p>

<p class="fst">I asked him if he knew what was happening at that moment below. I 
asked him to explain how he had dared to permit the presence of the sailors in 
the palace itself; why he had failed even to inform me of this beforehand.</p>

<p class="fst">He began to explain at excessive length that this conversation 
with the sailors was of no particular significance; that he was keeping careful 
watch, through some trusted men, on everything that was taking place; that he 
even considered these negotiations an event of extreme benefit for us. "Let them 
talk," he argued. "The day will pass in conversation and argument, and towards 
evening the situation will clear up; the infantry will arrive and we will change 
our tone."</p>

<p class="fst">So far as the surrender of myself was concerned, he assured me he 
would never accept anything of the kind, saying I could remain perfectly 
undisturbed on this point. He thought, however, that it might be useful if I 
personally, accompanied, of course, by a good escort&#8212;he offered to supply 
it&#8212;would go to Petrograd and try to reach an agreement with the various parties 
and even with Smolny Institute itself! To be sure, he added, the enterprise was 
rather risky, but was it not worth trying for the sake of the salvation of the 
country?</p>

<p class="fst">Thus spoke General Krassnoff to me. It was my last meeting with 
the general. The general's nervousness following upon the outward calm with 
which he had entered my room, the unsteady eyes, the strange smile&#8212;all this left 
no doubt of the actual situation. The bargaining for my head in progress 
downstairs was by no means as innocent as it was painted to me! The general 
left.</p>

<p class="fst">I revealed the whole truth to those who were still with me. What 
was to be done? All my relations with the Cossack detachment were now broken by 
the Cossacks themselves. It would have been quite proper for me to consider 
myself no longer bound to those who had already betrayed me. But there was no 
way of escape. I had prepared no measures for my personal safety. Nor were any 
preparations made for departure from Gatchina. We were too few for any armed 
resistance&#8212;less than ten. Escape from the palace was likewise impossible. Built 
by Paul I in the form of a closed rectangle, the palace grounds had but
<i>one</i> exit, already occupied by a mixed guard of Cossacks and sailors.</p>

<p class="fst">While we were discussing how to escape from the <i>impasse</i>, 
how to get out from the trap, one of the keepers of the palace appeared offering 
assistance. He explained that he knew of a secret underground exit, leading 
outside of the palace, but that it was impossible to make use of this exit 
before dark. If nothing happened before then, it was possible to escape from the 
trap by means of this secret exit. I requested my companions to lose no time and 
save themselves one by one as best they could.</p>

<p class="fst">I, personally, and Lieutenant Vinner determined not to give 
ourselves up to the traitors alive. That was all. Our plan was that, while the 
band of sailors and Cossacks would search for us in the front rooms, we would 
settle accounts with life by means of our revolvers in the) rear chambers. At 
that time, on the morning of November 14, 1917, this resolve seemed quite 
simple, logical and inevitable.</p>

<p class="fst">Time passed. We waited. Downstairs they were bargaining. 
Suddenly, at three o'clock in the afternoon, the same soldier who had brought 
us, in the morning, the news of Dybenko's arrival, came running in. His face was 
pale as death. The bargain had been concluded, he explained. The Cossacks had 
bought their freedom and the right to return to their homes with their arms for 
the price of only one human head! To carry out the bargain, <i>i.e.</i>, my 
arrest and surrender to the Bolsheviki, the enemies of yesterday, in quite 
friendly manner, had chosen a mixed commission. The sailors and Cossacks were 
ready to rush into my rooms at any moment.</p>

<p class="fst">What was Krassnoff's role in this deal? In the archives at 
General Headquarters there is a short and eloquent reply to this question. On 
November fourteenth General Dukhonin received a telegram from Krassnoff: "I 
ordered the arrest of the Commander-in-Chief; he managed to escape."</p>

<p class="fst">Those who saw General Dukhonin at that time say that on receiving 
the telegram he was convinced that the order for my arrest had been issued 
because of my intention to compromise with the Bolsheviki.</p>

<p class="fst">The agreement between the Cossacks and the sailors seemed to 
settle the situation finally, leaving me no avenue of escape. But a miracle 
happened!</p>

<p class="fst">Two men whom I had never met or known before come into the room&#8212;a 
soldier and a sailor.</p>

<p class="fst">"There is no time to lose. Put this on."</p>

<p class="fst">"This" consists of a sailor's cloak, a sailor's hat and 
automobile goggles. The cloak is too short for me. The hat is too small and 
persists in falling back on my neck. The masquerade attire appears ludicrous and 
dangerous. But there is nothing to be done. I have only a few minutes.</p>

<p class="fst">"At the gate, before the palace, an automobile awaits you."</p>

<p class="fst">We say good-by.</p>

<p class="fst">Together&#8212;the sailor and I&#8212;we walk out of my rooms through the 
back door. Two sailors come passing the door.</p>

<p class="fst">They walk slowly across the empty corridor, engaged in quiet, 
nonchalant conversation. The rectangular corridor seems endless.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, we are at the stairway. We go below to the only exit, 
already occupied by a mixed guard of Cossacks and sailors. The least mistake, an 
uncertain step, we will be discovered and all will be lost.</p>

<p class="fst">But we do not seem to think of that possibility at all. Our 
bodies move quite automatically, with perfectly balanced precision, like good 
machines. We pass the guard at the entrance door. Nothing!</p>

<p class="fst">We move under the arch. We look around. I certainly do look 
ludicrous. Again nothing.</p>

<p class="fst">We pass to the elevation before the palace. All is empty. There 
is no one to be seen! No automobile. We cannot understand at first what has 
happened.</p>

<p class="fst">We walk on.</p>

<p class="fst">Where? We don't know. To move faster is impossible.</p>

<p class="fst">"There has been a mix-up," says my new comrade.</p>

<p class="fst">"Let us go back," I reply.</p>

<p class="fst">We turn back.</p>

<p class="fst">We are again under the arch. We look around. We are now being 
observed.</p>

<p class="fst">We reenter the palace, through the door opposite to the one 
through which we left. This door leads straight to the guardroom.</p>

<p class="fst">We hear a diminishing distant roar. Dybenko's sailors and 
Krassnoff's Cossacks are running upstairs to arrest me.</p>

<p class="fst">At this moment we are met by the same friend who told us that an 
automobile would be waiting for us at the exit.</p>

<p class="fst">Imperceptibly, with an air of complete indifference, he passes 
us, saying:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"There has been a misunderstanding; the automobile is waiting 
for you at the exit from the town, at the Egyptian gates."</p>

<p class="fst">We turn and appear for the third time under the arch.</p>

<p class="fst">This is already too much. A guard takes a step forward in our 
direction. But here, under the arch, stands a trusted friend, an officer placed 
there for possible "necessity." He is covered with bandages; his face and body 
bear the scars of war. He "suddenly" grows faint and falls straight into the 
arms of him, a sailor or Cossack&#8212;I do not remember&#8212;who was about to approach us.</p>

<p class="fst">All eyes turn upon the officer who has fainted. We slip through.</p>

<p class="fst">We march through the city. The road is long. Gradually we put on 
speed. We meet a cab. We jump in.</p>

<p class="fst">"Go!"</p>

<p class="fst">From the distance we see the machine at the Egyptian gates. It 
seems as if we will never reach it. We almost stifle with impatience. Finally we 
are at our destination. We push into the hand of the cabman a ridiculously large 
bill. His eyes look with surprise at the machine, flying at breakneck speed.</p>

<p class="fst">The machine is an excellent one. So is the chauffeur, an aviator. 
We speed along the <i>chaussee</i> towards Luga at a fantastic rate. The 
chauffeur is master of the wheel. Inside the car are hand grenades. In the event 
of necessity we will hurl them at our pursuers.</p>

<p class="fst">A few minutes after our escape the pursuit begins.</p>

<p class="fst">Where and how I escaped is a puzzle to everybody in the palace.</p>

<p class="fst">Some friends at the palace take a most active part in the 
preparations. Our soldier, a chauffeur, a man absolutely devoted to me, appears 
"infuriated" at the escape. He volunteers to lead the pursuit. In my own 
machine, one I had used at the front, he follows along the route of our escape..</p>

<p class="fst">Others take the opposite direction. The automobile driven by my 
"pursuer" is filled with enemies. But this does not disturb him. While at full 
speed the excellent machine "suddenly" breaks down. We can no longer be 
overtaken.</p>

<p class="fst">But we do not know this. We speed on. But where are we going? 
Surely, not to Luga? We have not the slightest idea of what has taken place 
there in these last hours.</p>

<p class="fst">Near by, in the woods, there is a little peasant homestead. The 
occupants are simple folk, with no interest in politics, but honest.</p>

<p class="fst">They are acquaintances of the sailor friend with whom I escaped 
from the palace, although he has not been to see them for more than a year. We 
look around the <i>chaussée</i>. Not a soul is to be seen either in front or 
behind. We stop. Both of us jump out and disappear in the thick of the wood. The 
automobile proceeds.</p>

<p class="fst">From afar we hear the farewell of its horn.</p>

<p class="fst">While we had been speeding along the <i>chaussée</i> towards 
Luga, the trains with our long awaited infantry were approaching Gatchina from 
the opposite direction.</p>

<p class="fst">But it was too late. The first part of the strategic plan so 
cleverly conceived by the civilian and military "Kornilovites" was carried out 
brilliantly.</p>

<p class="fst">With the hands of the Bolsheviki the Provisional Government was 
overthrown. The hated man was no longer in power.</p>

<p class="fst">There remained only the task of executing the second and more 
important part of the plan: to "finish" the Bolsheviki within three weeks and to 
establish in Russia a "national" and, above all, a "strong government."</p>

<p class="fst">These three weeks have dragged out too long.</p>
