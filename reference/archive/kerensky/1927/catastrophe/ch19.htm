<h2><a name="h1">CHAPTER XIX</a><br>
<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>

<p class="fst">WITH Gatchina ended the history of the Provisional Government's 
struggle against Russia's foreign foes and her enemies within.</p>

<p class="fst">The natural center of the people's will and national 
consciousness, created by the Revolution itself, was finally destroyed by the 
combined efforts of the irresponsible extremists on the Right and on the Left.</p>

<p class="fst">Under the social, political and international conditions of that 
period as described in this book, it was inevitable that of the two extremes 
seeking dictatorship over Russia the victory should go to the dictators on the 
Left.</p>

<p class="fst">But on capturing the machinery of government, the Bolsheviki had 
by no means become the government of the country. On the contrary, the day of 
the official victory of Leninite reaction became only the first day of a long, 
most cruel and extremely bloody armed struggle of the Bolsheviki for power over 
the Russian people and the Russian state, which continues to this day.</p>

<p class="fst">The transfer of supreme power by the entire country into the 
hands of the Provisional Government in March, 1917, amidst the sudden outburst 
of anarchy in the first days of the Revolution, signified the prevention of 
civil war. The forcible seizure of the machinery of government by the Bolsheviki 
in November opened for Russia the period of civil war and terrorism, the period 
which has not yet found the conclusion.</p>

<p class="fst">"It is imperative to transform the exterior war of peoples into 
an interior war of classes," wrote Lenin in 1915. In November, 1917, this 
product of the madman's delirium became a reality for Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">I repeat: there is nothing more ridiculous than the opinion 
widely prevalent abroad that the Bolsheviki seized power in Russia without any 
serious resistance on the part of the "passive" nation. In reality, there was 
not a city of importance in Russia where street fighting was not in progress in 
the autumn of 1917 In the summer of 1918 the democratic forces of Russia created 
in the Volga region a government and an army for the defense of a free, 
republican order. The constant and stubborn resistance of the peasantry more 
than once provoked open rebellions.</p>

<p class="fst">The struggle of the organized forces of democracy ended in 
complete failure, under the pressure of the supporters of dictatorship on the 
Right and the Left. The centrifugal political forces of Russian democracy were 
temporarily wiped off the stage of history, while the representatives of two 
dictatorships&#8212;Red and White (Kolchak, Denikin, Wrangel)&#8212;contended for supremacy 
on the battlefields of civil war.</p>

<p class="fst">It is a common failure of people to fail to comprehend events 
occurring before them or to perceive the causation and connection of these 
events. It is because of this that the Bolsheviki have been able to deceive 
public opinion abroad into the belief that the civil war and the reign of terror 
had been forced upon them by the White generals and the other "bourgeois 
counter-revolutionists."</p>

<p class="fst">I have always been an uncompromising opponent of the activities 
of the so-called White dictators. I was and I remain an opponent of the blockade 
of Russia and of foreign military intervention in her struggle against the 
Bolsheviki. Nevertheless, one must not forget that all the evil done to Russia 
by the heirs of General Korniloff and by foreign intervention was only the 
inevitable consequence of the unpardonable crime committed by Lenin: the violent 
coup d'état carried out in the name of a minority dictatorship, on the eve of 
the convocation of the Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p class="fst">Even after their reactionary coup d'état of November seventh, the 
Bolsheviki still had an opportunity to extinguish the growing flames of civil 
war and to halt the destruction and dissolution of Russia. This they could have 
done by submitting to the authority of the Constitutent Assembly.</p>

<p class="fst">Under the Provisional Government the Bolsheviki passed as the 
most devoted supporters of democracy. "The speediest possible convocation of the 
Constituent Assembly" was one of their most insistent demands. One of the 
outstanding accusations which had been hurled daily against the Provisional 
Government by Lenin and his followers was that we had sought to postpone unduly 
the convocation of the Constituent Assembly. But all this democratic enthusiasm 
on the part of Lenin and his lieutenants was mere demagogic play on the 
sentiments of the people, who had faith in the Constituent Assembly and wished 
for its convocation.</p>

<p class="fst">In reality, as Lenin himself put it quite bluntly at the meeting 
of the Central Committee of the Bolshevist party, October 23, 1917, the 
Bolshevist knew quite well that the Constituent Assembly would be against them. 
It was precisely for this reason that two weeks before the opening of the 
campaign for the election to the Constituent Assembly, the Bolsheviki executed 
their reactionary coup d'état, made necessary to prevent Russia's success in her 
negotiations with Austria following's Vienna's plea for a separate peace. A 
separate peace with Austria, followed soon thereafter by peace with Bulgaria and 
Turkey and by the isolation of Germany would have meant the end of the War, the 
triumph of the Provisional Government, the victory of democracy and the end of 
all efforts at the establishment of dictatorship. It was the last chance the 
Bolsheviki had and Lenin was determined not to lose it.</p>

<p class="fst">The coup of November seventh sealed the fate of the Constituent 
Assembly. But neither the people nor even the leaders of the democratic 
anti-Bolshevist parties understood this at the beginning. They could not 
conceive the possibility of a Bolshevist attack on the sovereign will of the 
people, expressed by the Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p class="fst">However, the Bolsheviki themselves hoped at first that with the 
overthrow of the "bourgeois" Provisional Government and with the machinery of 
power in their hands the elections to the Constituent Assembly would bring a 
Bolshevist majority. This, of course, failed to develop.</p>

<p class="fst">The peasant majority of the first Russian Constituent Assembly, 
headed by the Social-Revolutionary party, did not betray the principles of 
democracy and the fundamental traditions of the liberation movement. It refused 
to give its approval to the coup d'état of November seventh.</p>

<p class="fst">On the very first day of its convocation (January 5, 1918), the 
Constituent Assembly was dispersed by the bayonets of drunken Bolshevist 
sailors. Over the telephone from Smolny Institute Lenin demanded the shooting of 
the chosen representatives of the people. The demand failed to reach in time the 
proper destination.</p>

<p class="fst">On the morning of the convocation of the Constituent Assembly a 
peaceful demonstration of unarmed thousands in favor of the Constituent Assembly 
was dispersed by the rifles of Lettish Sharpshooters, brought into Petrograd for 
the defense of the Bolsheviki against the people. On the same day A. I. 
Shingarioff and F. F. Kokoshkin, former members of the Provisional Government 
and duly elected members of the Constituent Assembly were foully murdered in 
their beds in a hospital by their own Bolshevik guards.</p>

<p class="fst">In defending their reactionary policy before the workers of the 
West, the Bolsheviki justify their dissolution of the Constituent Assembly by 
asserting that the assembly was composed of the "class enemies of the workers 
and peasants." This is, of course, a palpable falsehood. Even were we to accept 
for the sake of argument the demagogic and deeply erroneous viewpoint according 
to which every nonsocialist is a "class enemy" of the workers and peasants, the 
number of such enemies in the Constituent Assembly did not exceed fifteen.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1*]</a> 
And even those were not admitted to the Constituent Assembly by the Bolsheviki. 
Thus, the Assembly dispersed by the Bolsheviki consisted solely of 
representatives of democratic and socialist parties.</p>

<p class="fst">Ten years have passed since the fall of the Provisional 
Government and the forcible dissolution of the Constituent Assembly created by 
that government, but the aims of the Bolshevist dictatorship remain as 
irreconcilable as ever with the fundamental life interests of Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">Leninism represents the most complete political, social and 
economic reaction, unprecedented in the history of Europe. And like all 
reaction, the dictatorship of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of 
the Bolshevist party is utterly incapable of any gradual, evolutionary and 
peaceful readjustment of its substance.</p>

<p class="fst">To be sure, Russia has during the ten years returned from the 
complete economic paralysis of the period of integral Leninism (1918-20), styled 
shamefacedly by the Bolsheviki as "military communism," through the "Nep" to 
purely capitalist forms.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2*]</a> But 
this capitalism represents a most backward, primitive, avaricious and poorly 
productive order, based upon the most cruel exploitation of the workers and 
peasants.</p>

<p class="fst">The experiment of the Bolshevist reaction has proved once more 
that no social or political progress is possible without recognition and 
affirmation of the rights of the individual to complete liberty of thought, of 
conscience and of expression.</p>

<p class="fst">Social welfare, popular enlightenment, domestic order and 
international security will not be assured to the Russian people as long as the 
Bolsheviki continue to hold Russia in the grip of their party dictatorship. For 
no social order capable of guaranteeing to the people the blessings of work and 
freedom is possible in a country the people of which are deprived of fundamental 
human rights and civil liberties, of economic initiative and of the protection 
of law based and administered on the principle of equality. Where "party 
expediency" gives way to social and national interest there can be no 
civilization and no real progress.</p>

<p class="fst">To-day, after ten years of Bolshevist domination, Russia stands 
at the starting point of the circle of Leninism: terrorism and severe economic 
crisis. These are the results of acute, unnatural, artificial economic and 
political causes, collectively expressed in the nature and substance of 
dictatorship, which stifles the independent, creative life and activity of the 
people.</p>

<p class="fst">In the struggle for liberation Russia must inevitably return to 
the road of popular, national, democratic construction, the road upon which the 
Russian people embarked&#8212;hesitatingly and with uncertain step&#8212;in March, 1917!</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1*]</a> Two-thirds of the Constituent Assembly consisted of 
Social-Revolutionaries. There were less than a score Mensheviki and less than 
fifteen Constitutional-Democrats. The Bolsheviki, therefore, controlled less 
than one-third of the membership.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n2" href="#fn2">[2*]</a> The "Nep"&#8212;new economic policy&#8212;was proclaimed by Lenin in the spring of 
1921, after the celebrated revolt of the Kronstadt sailors, a series of peasant 
uprisings and the terrible famine of that year, a famine such as had not been 
experienced by Russia since 1613. The "Nep" restored internal economic freedom 
to the villages and freedom of trade in the cities&#8212;A. K.</p>
