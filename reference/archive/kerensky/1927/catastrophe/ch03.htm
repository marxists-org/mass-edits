<h2><a name="h1">CHAPTER III</a><br>
<small>WITHIN THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT</small></h2>

<p class="fst">I HOPE the reader has by this time sufficiently grasped the 
political and social environment in which the Provisional Government was obliged 
to begin its work.</p>

<p class="fst">Upon its formation, March sixteenth, and its departure from the 
superheated atmosphere of the Tauride Palace, the government held its sessions 
temporarily in the main meeting room of the Ministry of the Interior. In the 
silence of the spacious, quiet, ministerial chamber, hung with portraits of 
former rulers, imperial ministers and representatives of Russian reaction, every 
one of us understood, perhaps for the first time, the change that had come upon 
Russia. There were eleven of us. Every one of us had been regarded by the 
Czarist Ministry of the Interior with hostility and suspicion. And now we had in 
our hands the supreme power of the great empire, power that came to us at the 
most difficult period of the War, after an explosion which swept away the entire 
old machinery of administration.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1*]</a></p>

<p class="fst">I remember with what emotion Prince Lvoff read to us at our first 
meeting a report on the situation in the provinces. From all towns and cities, 
provincial and county seats came telegrams which seemed as if they had been 
written by one and the same hand. They all told the same story: the old 
administration, from the governor to the last town policeman and village bailiff 
had disappeared without trace, and everywhere were being formed, instead, all 
sorts of self-appointed organizations&#8212;Soviets, committees of public safety, 
conferences of public leaders, etc., etc.</p>

<p class="fst">"I have telegraphed," the prince told us, "to all the chairmen of 
zemstvo administrations the suggestion that they assume temporarily the duties 
of governors, in the capacity of commissars of the Provisional Government." But 
in the majority of cases the chairmen of the zemstvo administrations in the 
provinces were conservatives and, frequently, quite outspoken reactionaries. 
They enjoyed no wide influence and could not maintain themselves in authority 
for a week. Very much the same was true everywhere in the provinces with regard 
to the military authorities. Somewhat more favorable was the situation with 
respect to the judicial machinery. But here, too, even in Petrograd, where the 
institution of the election of magistrates had remained intact, there was a 
difficult situation. The villages, liberated from all administrative vigilance, 
had begun to "govern themselves." There was an immediate mad rush by the 
peasantry for the land.</p>

<p class="fst">In the cities, various self-appointed organizations, whipped up 
by the raging revolutionary tempest, were devoting themselves to such creative 
revolutionary activities as raids, searches, confiscations and the liberation 
not only of political prisoners but also of criminals of the most desperate hue.</p>

<p class="fst">One need only visualize for a moment this raging human ocean, 
freed from all bonds, this molten, as yet formless revolutionary mass, to 
realize the tremendous historic and positive role played by the Soviets, which 
everywhere, as in Petrograd, contributed greatly to the establishment of 
revolutionary discipline. Despite all their great errors and frequent 
stupidities, the Soviets represented the first primitive social and political 
molds into which the molten revolutionary lava began gradually to flow and to 
cool off.</p>

<p class="fst">Sometimes it seems to me that the word "revolution" is quite 
inapplicable to what happened in Russia between March twelfth and sixteenth. A 
whole world of national and political relationships simply sank to the bottom, 
and at once all existing political and tactical programs and plans, however bold 
and well conceived, appeared hanging aimlessly and uselessly in space. The 
political parties that survived the March earthquake (the 
Social-Revolutionaries; the Social-Democrats and the 
Constitutional-Democrats&#8212;all other more moderate and conservative parties being 
reduced at once to zero or almost to zero) sought to act in accordance with all 
the rules of Western European political art. Their leaders tried to classify the 
character of the Revolution by calling it "bourgeois" or "socialist." They put 
forward political proposals, which in their opinion demanded immediate 
realization, and disputed about compromise formulae. But no one wanted to 
perceive the most important thing of all: the disappearance of the machinery of 
state, the need of restoring the apparatus of administration itself, without 
which all programs, platforms, formulas, resolutions, etc. assume the value of 
so much useless paper.</p>

<p class="fst">According to opinions in Russia and abroad, based on the classic 
models of the French Revolution of 1789, the epoch of the Provisional Government 
can be divided into two periods: first, the bourgeois period, under the 
premiership of Prince Lvoff, and, second, the socialist period, under the 
premiership of Kerensky. Correspondingly, it is customary to say that in the 
second period the government was more radical in its legislative work, less 
constructive in its methods of administration and weaker in the application of 
administrative compulsion.</p>

<p class="fst">The terms bourgeois and socialist would probably be applicable to 
the Russian Revolution if after the March upheaval all power in Russia had 
actually been in the hands of the bourgeoisie itself, organized as in the West 
in compact class formation, able to fight for power and knowing how to keep it.</p>

<p class="fst">This interpretation would probably be correct if such a 
bourgeoisie had been susperseded in the natural course of the struggle for power 
by the fourth estate&#8212; the city, village and intellectual proletariat, and which 
would have occupied in the first, the bourgeois period of the Revolution, the 
position of an oppressed social class.</p>

<p class="fst">But such was not the situation. On the contrary, exactly the 
opposite occurred.</p>

<p class="fst">The very formation of the Provisional Government took place under 
circumstances of tragic misunderstanding.</p>

<p class="fst">Given to thinking along the line of historical precedents and 
knowing the art of handling theoretical propositions rather than that of 
orienting themselves in the confusion of real life, the ideologists of the 
"bourgeois democracy" believed sincerely that the downfall of absolutism would 
be marked by the transfer of all power into the hands of the 
liberal-conservative bourgeoisie represented by the Progressive Bloc in the 
fourth Duma. On the other hand, the socialist leaders and the ideologists of the 
"revolutionary proletariat" fully accepted this phantastic idea, for it 
coincided with their own theoretical conceptions, based on the very best 
European models of the development of a "real" revolution. Viewed from the point 
of view of the precedent of the French Revolution, the period of the Russian 
Revolution, beginning with March twelfth, constituted the epoch of the National 
Assembly and the Girondins.</p>

<p class="fst">Subsequently, within a few years, it was to give way to the 
Jacobin Terror, etc. The absence of life instinct and of political intuition in 
the minds of political dogmatists assumed at times most curious propensities. 
Thus, during their joint consideration of the program of the Provisional 
Government, the representatives of the Soviet (or of the so-called revolutionary 
democracy) forced on the Temporary Committee of the Duma the obligation not to 
determine beforehand the future form of government in Russia, pending 
convocation of the Constituent Assembly, while P. N. Miliukoff, the ideologist 
of the Progressive Bloc, fought long and stubbornly against this limitation. 
What was all this about? It was very simple: P. N. Miliukoff was convinced of 
the inevitability of a constitutional monarchy in Russia after the Revolution 
(and on the night of March sixteenth), while the leaders of the revolutionary 
proletariat did not venture to demand openly the establishment of a republic, at 
a time when the republic had already become an historic fact.</p>

<p class="fst">The Soviet leaders, guided by Western European political 
formulae, believed sincerely that after March twelfth the political power had to 
be in the hands of the bourgeoisie, this power to be controlled by the labor 
democracy, headed by the "class conscious proletariat," which would support the 
government only to the extent to which it did not misuse its dominant position 
in the country to the disadvantage of the basic interests of the masses.</p>

<p class="fst">Both sides&#8212;P. N. Miliukoff and the accidental leaders of the 
Soviet, drawn from the ranks of the revolutionists of 1905&#8212;were quite sincerely 
convinced of the wisdom of their opinions; they failed to notice what was 
actually taking place about them and to sense the profundity of the popular 
upheaval.</p>

<p class="fst">I write this not with intent of sitting in judgment upon the 
leaders of that period. On the contrary, I wish only to show right at the 
beginning that neither ill will nor mischief played any conspicuous role, nor 
had any appreciable part in the development of those future acute disagreements 
around the issue of the Provisional Government, which contributed to the 
weakening of the government's barely established authority. The entire depth of 
the tragic catastrophe experienced by Russia is measured precisely by the fact 
that despite all their good will and their urge to help the country, people 
frequently injured it because they failed to realize the substance and meaning 
of what was taking place.</p>

<p class="fst">Ignoring all historical comparisons and European precedents, the 
problem before the Provisional Government and the political organizations and 
parties supporting it, however conditionally, was not a complex but a simple 
one, yet extremely difficult in its simplicity.</p>

<p class="fst">It was necessary to restore the country and the state.</p>

<p class="fst">This task of reconstruction did not consist in restoring 
territorial boundaries embracing a definite population. In this material sense 
of the word, Russia did not as yet require restoration, for Russia was still 
intact. The task of the moment was the restoration of the national governmental 
fabric as a creative, administrative and protective political organism. This 
meant, first of all, restoration of the administrative apparatus, of the 
machinery of government. It meant teaching some to govern and others to yield 
obedience. This problem was rendered all the more difficult by the necessity of 
continuing the War and by the need of what was in reality tantamount to 
reconstruction of all juridical, economic and social foundations of the country.</p>

<p class="fst">One of the strongest and brightest impressions of my life is the 
recollection of the work of the first cabinet of the Provisional Government, 
composed, as Lenin described it, of ten capitalist ministers, among whom I 
occupied the position of "hostage of the democracy."</p>

<p class="fst">Had Lenin and his lieutenants possessed one-hundredth part of the 
ability to renounce all personal considerations of power and vanity, of the 
capacity for unselfish service to the country and the people displayed by the 
millionaires Terestchenko and Konovaloff; by such typical representatives of the 
landed nobility as V. Lvoff, or by that characteristic liberal intellectual A. 
I. Shingarioff, Russia would have in all probability escaped the Golgotha to 
which she was brought by the blind, senseless, utterly unnecessary fomenting of 
class hatred by the irresponsible demagogues of Bolshevism.</p>

<h4>PRINCE GEORGE LVOFF</h4>

<p class="fst">Above all did Prince G. E. Lvoff represent the make-up and spirit 
of the Provisional Government. This true aristocrat, whose family had its roots 
in centuries of Russian history, was undoubtedly the most democratic among us, 
closer than any of us to the real soul of the Russian muzhik.</p>

<p class="fst">Modest, almost unnaturally retiring, absent-minded in all matters 
concerning himself, the prince outwardly possessed not a single earmark of the 
head of a government. Revolting against the whole past of his power-loving 
ancestors, baronial rulers of medieval Russia, he seemed to have subdued in 
himself the family instinct for power. He felt a revulsion against all the 
exterior attributes of authority and of the state. During the sessions of the 
Provisional Government he kept deliberately in the background and saw to it that 
every one had an opportunity to speak his mind to the end, to say everything he 
wished to say. Rarely, almost never, did he interject a word of command or 
criticism into the stormy debates of the cabinet, seeking always to bring about 
agreement by a kind word of wisdom, forgetting frequently the necessity for 
hurry to keep the government from lagging behind the elemental sweep of events.</p>

<p class="fst">All his life the prince had struggled stubbornly, unceasingly, 
with tremendous energy, against the stupid, ferocious, bureaucratic machine of 
the old absolutism. But he always approached the painful questions of Russian 
life not like a politician but in a peculiarly original manner. He moved not 
from ideas to man but from man to ideas.</p>

<p class="fst">Although detesting the old regime, the prince had always 
succeeded in striking some human chords in the men who served it. He. would 
gather about him leading men and women devoted to the people's interests, and 
draw up, with their cooperation, plans and programs of social welfare. Then, 
unostentatiously, he would depart for some ministry or some gubernatorial 
center, where single-handed, by means he alone seemed to possess, he would 
accomplish what innumerable political resolutions and demands of the Duma or 
zemstvo organs failed to achieve.</p>

<p class="fst">In his work the prince covered the length and breadth of Russia. 
In most difficult periods of agricultural crises, he promoted successfully the 
work of moving masses of peasants to settlements in the Far East. During the 
Russo-Japanese War, as head of the zemstvo organizations, he did much for the 
wounded and accomplished what was far beyond his official duties and 
limitations. He was a member of the first Duma. But this page of his career, in 
the opinion of some the most striking of his life, he regarded as the most 
uninteresting and unnecessary. After the dissolution of the first Duma, he left 
the Constitutional-Democratic party and went out to seek again, in his own way, 
new roads to the happiness and welfare of the people.</p>

<p class="fst">Long before the European War, in the period of the cruel Stolypin 
reaction (1907-11) he began to devote himself to the organization of the 
independent forces of the zemstvos. Slowly and surely the prince assembled 
around him elements which could, in the moment of the death of the old regime, 
take over, if necessary, the machinery of government.</p>

<p class="fst">It is remarkable how the roads of the two most typical 
representatives of aristocratic and bourgeois Russia, of Prince Lvoff and 
Gutchkoff, met during the War in this work of the building up of independent 
political and social organizations and of the selection of men of administrative 
ability, for during the period after the Russo-Japanese War and of the first 
Duma the two men had been politically widely divergent.</p>

<p class="fst">During the European War the name of Prince Lvoff became the 
symbol of the social and cultural forces of Russia. At the front he gained great 
popularity in the commanding corps because of the tremendous work for the army 
performed under his leadership by the Union of Zemstvos.</p>

<p class="fst">I met the prince for the first time shortly before the 
Revolution&#8212;I think it was in December, 1916. I had already made the acquaintance 
of his close associates and knew not only of the general humanitarian and social 
work but also of the contrabandist political activity of Lvoff's circle. Sensing 
the hurricane advancing upon Russia, I felt finally that I could no longer 
postpone making the personal acquaintance of one who was obviously destined to 
be one of the future political leaders of emancipated Russia. I met the prince 
in Moscow, at the headquarters of the Governing Committee of the Union of 
Zemstvos, following his adjournment of some business meeting. After exchanging 
salutations he led me to his study. There after a brief conversation we came to 
understand one another, both of us realizing the tribulations awaiting the 
country in the very near future.</p>

<p class="fst">There was a peculiar simplicity, bordering at times on what 
seemed to be
<i>naiveté</i>, in the political conversation of the prince. But behind this
<i>naiveté</i> lay concealed a deep knowledge of the people and one sensed that 
he had not only felt the problems of Russia through his heart but had thought 
them out carefully through his mind. Soon after the beginning of the Revolution 
many of the admirers and associates of the prince began to hate or to detest him 
for his "lack of will-power," for his "Tolstoyan non-resistance to evil." 
However, let those who consider the prince's policy in the first weeks of the 
Revolution, both as premier and minister of the interior, as "non-resistance to 
evil," let them undertake to build a house of cards in a tempest, under the open 
sky, to the accompaniment of an all-devouring hurricane! The prince perceived 
honestly the full depth and measure of the decay and dissolution of old Russia. 
He, therefore, looked upon the elemental explosion of the people's fury without 
astonishment. He understood, suffered and forgave. There are moments in the 
history of all nations when the highest wisdom of a ruler expresses itself in 
being able to wait, in the ability to grasp instinctively and not by reason the 
outwardly invisible spiritual pangs and experiences of the nation.</p>

<p class="fst">"Let not your hearts be cast down by Russia's freedom," said the 
prince in the beginning of May at a meeting of the Duma, in a speech remarkable 
for its thought and faith. To the prince the heritage of Russia's struggle for 
emancipation lay not in a collection of dead formulas, fit only for the 
archives, but in the life and substance of the course of events.</p>

<p class="fst">The prince did not reveal "strong will-power" either as premier 
or as minister of the interior. But how could he have revealed it had he desired 
to do so? Police officials had just begun to reappear in city streets&#8212;they were 
termed militia men, in order not to revive recollections of the old regime&#8212;and 
they were men, assembled hurriedly and casually, who had but little conception 
of the technical features of their work.</p>

<p class="fst">When newspapermen sought to learn from the prince, following his 
initial sad experience in trying to find substitutes for the provincial 
governors, what he intended to do and whom he intended to appoint, he replied: 
"We will not appoint any one. The local populations themselves will elect and 
inform us accordingly, and we will approve." Most astonishing "non-resistance"? 
Not at all. It was simply a demonstration of the prince's profound knowledge of 
the situation and of his realization that the moment had not yet come for the 
central authorities to exercise the power of appointment and to issue orders. As 
soon as the situation in the various towns and provinces permitted it, with the 
natural simmering down of the boiling cauldron, the central authorities began to 
act.</p>

<p class="fst">"We will build the new life of the people not by ourselves but 
together with the people." These words of Prince Lvoff, expressed in another way 
by Abraham Lincoln, should enable my readers to understand the remarkable 
personality of the first freely chosen spokesman of the government of Free 
Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">We may, therefore, ask, could such a man be the representative of 
the class interests of the bourgeoisie? Could he express the will of the 
propertied classes when his entire soul was bound much more intimately, tenderly 
and deeply than that of men like Lenin with the aspirations, the actual 
interests, the whole future of the Russian peasantry? This future lay in the 
land.</p>

<p class="fst">BASIC REFORMS The land! No mention of it is to be found in the 
declaration of the Provisional Government made public on the day of its 
assumption of office! Nevertheless, at its very first meeting, A. I. 
Shingarioff&#8212;afterwards killed by the Bolsheviki, on the eve of the convocation 
of the Constituent Assembly of which he had been elected a member&#8212;was instructed 
by unanimous decision of the cabinet, and without any discussion, to work out a 
basic plan for the complete readjustment of land distribution and to prepare 
measures for the execution of this social reform, unprecedented in the history 
of Europe. Perhaps somewhere in the subconsciousness of one or another member of 
the Provisional Government there was a trace of doubt against this bold way of 
putting the question of the abolition of the entire old system of land 
ownership, but this egoistic feeling, so entirely natural to any man, was 
immediately suppressed by the imperative need of surrendering and sacrificing 
all for the sake of the country.</p>

<p class="fst">On April second, the Provisional Government promulgated its 
agrarian reform, which was to give all the land into the hands of those who 
worked it, and on the same day the government created a Central Land Committee, 
which, in cooperation with similar provincial and county land committees and 
elected representatives of the population, was to draft a basic land law for 
presentation to the Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p class="fst">Quite simply, without any struggle, without any of the classic 
revolutionary scenes on the order of the celebrated oath of the French nobility 
at the beginning of the Revolution of 1789, occurred this fundamental social 
change. A great, real and unprecedented social revolution was brought about 
through the signatures of the representatives of that propertied Russia which, 
according to all party formula, should have defended the "propertied privileges 
of the bourgeoisie."</p>

<p class="fst">Likewise, the first declaration of the Provisional Government, 
drafted jointly by the representatives of the revolutionary proletariat from the 
Soviet and of the Temporary Committee of the Duma, contained not a word about 
the labor question. On this question the "bourgeois" government had the complete 
freedom of action it enjoyed in the land problem. Nevertheless, on March 
twentieth, Konovaloff, the new minister of commerce and industry, Moscow 
millionaire and proprietor of a large manufacturing establishment, placed at the 
head of his program the creation, in connection with the Ministry of the 
Interior, of a special labor division, incorporating representatives of labor 
organizations in the machinery of the department, which began functioning on May 
twentieth. On March twenty-fourth, Konovaloff introduced the eight-hour day in 
the shops and factories of Petrograd, by agreement with the manufacturers. Soon 
after he recognized the workers' shop committees and began the establishment, by 
agreement with the representatives of employers and employees, of special boards 
of arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes. The Provisional 
Government's measure determining the function of trade unions in the state 
remains a model to this day. What the Provisional Government failed to include 
in its work was only the demagogy of Lenin, so destructive and so costly to the 
workers themselves.</p>

<p class="fst">In comparison with the scope of its constructive social reforms, 
the purely political program of the "bourgeois" Provisional Government, 
representing the only measures to which it pledged itself, appears as a mere 
trifle. After long casuistical disputes, of interest only to themselves, the 
socialist intellectuals representing the Soviet and the liberal professors 
representing the Duma had drafted the following measures which the Provisional 
Government was to put into effect:</p>

<p class="fst">1. Complete and immediate amnesty for all acts of political and 
religious nature, including acts of political assassination, military uprisings 
and agrarian disturbances. (This was put into effect March nineteenth, followed 
by abolition of capital punishment on March twenty-fifth.)</p>

<p class="fst">2. Freedom of speech, press, assembly, trade union organization 
and strikes, and application of political liberties to men in the military 
service in so far as these were practicable under the technical limitations of 
the selrvice. (Put into effect immediately.)</p>

<p class="fst">3. Abolition of all juridical discriminations based on 
distinctions of class, creed and nationality. (Put into effect April 
twenty-sixth.)</p>

<p class="fst">4. Immediate preparations for the convocation of the Constituent 
Assembly (on the basis of universal, equal, direct and secret suffrage), whose 
function it would be to determine the form of government and the constitution. 
(Preparations begun at once.)</p>

<p class="fst">On May eighth a special commission, with the participation of 
representatives of all parties and social organizations, assembled for the 
drafting of an electoral law to govern the elections to the Constituent 
Assembly, and of technical measures for the election.</p>

<p class="fst">5. The substitution for the old police of a people's militia, its 
chieftains to be chosen by popular election and to be subordinate to the local 
government authorities. (Organization of such a militia was begun at once.)</p>

<p class="fst">6. Election of all organs of local self-government on the basis 
of universal, direct, equal and secret suffrage.</p>

<p class="fst">On May second the government made public its measure for the 
election of city councils and on May twenty-eighth was promulgated the basic 
reform of local zemstvo self-government.</p>

<p class="fst">The official program of the Provisional Government was thus put 
into realization within a few weeks.</p>

<p class="fst">In addition, during the two months of its existence, the first 
cabinet of the Provisional Government accomplished the following:</p>

<p class="fst">It proclaimed the independence of Poland.</p>

<p class="fst">It restored the autonomy of Finland.</p>

<p class="fst">It created committees for the working out of local autonomy in 
the Ukraine and Latvia.</p>

<p class="fst">It reorganized the administration of government in Turkestan and 
in the Caucasus and in Turkish Armenia and Galicia which were occupied by 
Russian troops.</p>

<p class="fst">It abolished all special courts, introducing the general system 
of trial by jury.</p>

<p class="fst">It reorganized the food distribution system, strengthening the 
grain monopoly and introducing fixed prices on all articles of necessity.</p>

<p class="fst">It established county zemstvos and reformed the system of peasant 
administrative machinery.</p>

<p class="fst">It promulgated a law for the improvement and development of 
cooperatives which is regarded as exemplary to this day.</p>

<p class="fst">It abolished the exile system and reformed the prison system.</p>

<p class="fst">It restored the institution of the election of magistrates.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, the Provisional Government changed radically the 
administration of the Church, restoring the complete independence of the 
Orthodox Church, and prepared also the convocation of a sobor, which had not 
been convened for two hundred years, and which in the autumn of 1917 restored 
the patriarchate.</p>

<p class="fst">The measures enumerated above were sufficient to occupy 
generations of normal political effort. The Provisional Government carried out 
these measures quickly and easily, despite the fact that it was burdened by the 
War, with all the involved problems of communications, the food supply and acute 
financial difficulties.</p>

<p class="fst">I assert confidently that as soon as Russia emerges from the 
present period of Bolshevist reaction, she will inevitably resume the work of 
national reconstruction on the basis of the political, juridical and social 
principles laid down in the first two months of the Provisional Government.</p>
