<h2><a name="h1">CHAPTER XV</a><br>
<small>LAVRE KORNILOFF</small></h2>

<p class="fst">THE reminscences of my childhood in Simbirsk connect me with the 
Lenin (Ulianoff) family. In my youth fate brought me together with Korniloff.</p>

<p class="fst">Following our removal from Simbirsk, my father was chief 
inspector of schools in Turkestan. My high school years were spent in Tashkent.</p>

<p class="fst">The capital of Russian Turkestan was, above all, a military 
center. Many of the leading figures of the Great War, particularly officers of 
the General Staff, served at one time or another of their career in Tashkent. 
Among them was the young Captain Korniloff, who came to Tashkent immediately 
upon his graduation from the Military Academy. Slight of build, thin and wiry, 
with slanting, slightly Kalmyk eyes, Korniloff was of simple origin. ("I am 
General Korniloff, peasant, son of a Cossack," wrote the future rebellious 
general in one of his proclamations to the people.) General Korniloff spent 
little time in fashionable drawing-rooms, although their doors were always open 
to any officer of the General Staff, and had no liking for the ladies of the 
social set. He was regarded as rather shy and even somewhat of a "savage."</p>

<p class="fst">Very soon Captain Korniloff became the talk of the capital. 
Having mastered one of the local dialects, Captain Korniloff carried out a very 
brave enterprise. Alone, disguised as a native merchant, he made his way into 
the buffer state between Russian Turkestan and British India, at that time heart 
of Afghanistan, forbidden ground to all foreigners, particularly military men. 
On his return to Tashkent, the young captain became the hero of the hour. 
However, he did not permit himself to be carried away by the prospect of social 
success. Very soon he again astonished the "high society" of the provincial 
capital by marrying the daughter of a minor official in my father's department. 
This was too much: the doors of society were closed to him!</p>

<p class="fst">Many years later, almost on the eve of his revolt against the 
Provisional Government, General Korniloff, Commander-in-Chief, breakfasted with 
me at the Winter Palace. After a rather tense conversation in my office, we 
engaged in light chatter at breakfast.</p>

<p class="fst">"You probably do not remember me," said General Korniloff to me 
jocularly. "I used to visit your people and even danced in your house in 
Tashkent."</p>

<p class="fst">"Of course, how can one fail to remember that," I said, recalling 
the impression produced on all by his bold expedition to Afghanistan.</p>

<p class="fst">Korniloff remained all his life a man of simple tastes, a man of 
the people. There was nothing of the hereditary bureaucrat or of the 
aristocratic landed noble in him. Incidentally, all the three leading figures of 
the "white" movement&#8212;Korniloff, Alexeyeff, Denikin&#8212;were of lowly origin and had 
made their way to the top of the military hierarchy by their own efforts. Being 
poor, they experienced fully the burdens of an officer's career under the old 
regime. All three were distinctly hostile to the privileged elements in the 
army, represented by the Guards. All three made brilliant records at the 
Military Academy. And all three made rapid advances with the War, which ruined 
so many brilliant careers, of the kind promoted in court circles and ministerial 
anterooms.</p>

<p class="fst">Already in 1915, Alexeyeff made his way to General Headquarters 
as chief-of-staff to the Commander-in-Chief, Nicholas II. The outbreak of the 
Revolution found Denikin and Korniloff at the front. Both did remarkable work in 
all operations on the Galician Front. In one unfortunate operation, in which he 
showed all his personal daring and bravery, Korniloff was taken prisoner by the 
Austrians. His bold escape and spectacular return to the Russian lines became 
the source of a kind of Korniloff legend, although it did not reach the broad 
masses of the people and of the army rank and file.</p>

<p class="fst">Of all the three future leaders of the White armies Korniloff was 
least fit for political work. On the other hand, General Alexeyeff had 
considerable political acumen but was too much of a politician. In military 
science Korniloff was not a strategist but only a tactician, which corresponded 
entirely with his impulsive, unthinking nature, given to no consideration in 
moments of danger and acting in such moments with lightninglike boldness, 
oblivious to the possible consequences.</p>

<p class="fst">Apparently, it was this very characteristic of all too great and 
unthinking determination and zeal, not always desirable in responsible military 
leaders, that impeded Korniloff's advancement. Up until the Revolution he 
remained in the shade. After the Revolution, his career developed contrary to 
the will of his immediate military superiors. His very appointment in the first 
days of the Revolution as commander of the Petrograd military district failed to 
win the approval of General Alexeyeff. However, in this post General Korniloff 
proved himself entirely "weak," and, being unable to handle the Petrograd 
garrison, he returned to the front in May.</p>

<p class="fst">Immediately preceding his resignation as war minister, Gutchkoff 
wanted to appoint Korniloff commander of the Northern Front, but met with the 
strong disapproval of General Alexeyeff, who under threat of his own resignation 
compelled Gutchkoff to abandon his intention. Korniloff thereupon became 
commander of the thirteenth army in Galicia, where Zavoiko found him.</p>

<p class="fst">When at the time of the Tarnopol break and the beginning of the 
German counter-offensive in Galicia, I suggested to General Brusiloff, 
Commander-in-Chief, the removal of the obviously incompetent General Koutor and 
the substitution for him as commander on the Galician Front of General 
Korniloff, I met with almost the same opposition from Brusiloff as was 
experienced by Gutchkoff from Alexeyeff. Nevertheless Korniloff was appointed to 
the post. Contrary to similar opposition by military authorities, General 
Korniloff was at my suggestion named, on August first, commander-in-chief of the 
Russian armies, in place of Brusiloff, who had lost his will to command.</p>

<p class="fst">I have set down this account of General Korniloff's career in 
order that the reader may understand the events that followed and may realize 
why I did not and could not to the very last moment see General Korniloff among 
the conspirators, despite all the indications of the military conspiracy in 
preparation against the Provisional Government and the great amount of evidence 
gathered on it by myself. In pushing him forward to the highest post in the 
army, in the face of the opposition of his superiors and of his unpopularity 
among the political Left; in ignoring his own extremely undisciplined utterances 
with regard to the Provsional Government and in exercising on occasion all too 
much patience in this respect, I believed firmly that the incomparably brave 
soldier would not engage in political hide-and-seek games and would not shoot 
from ambush.</p>

<p class="fst">To Russia's great misfortune this did happen.</p>
