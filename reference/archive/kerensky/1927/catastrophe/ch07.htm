<h2><a name="h1">CHAPTER VII</a><br>
<small>GUTCHKOFF</small></h2>

<p class="fst">ALEXANDER GUTCHKOFF was one of the most colorful and interesting 
political figures of pre-revolutionary Russia. A prominent social and commercial 
leader of Moscow, a typical representative of the Moscow merchant world, 
Gutchkoff was to a large extent a self-made man. His career was most original. 
In the Boer War he dropped his business and went to fight on the side of the 
Boers. In the Russo-Japanese War he covered Manchuria as a representative of the 
Red Cross and there had opportunity to observe the defects of the old Russian 
bureaucratic military machine. A participant in the moderate liberation 
movement, the height of the revolutionary disturbances of 1905 found him on the 
right flank of the zemstvo and municipal reform organizations. Breaking with the 
liberals of the type of Miliukoff, he became the leader of the conservative 
Octobrist party (the first constitutional manifesto of Nicholas II was issued 
October 17, 1905).</p>

<p class="fst">This party became the constitutional support of the Stolypin 
government after the dissolution of the first Duma, in the summer of 1906, and 
the suppression of the popular anti-government movement. Gutchkoff himself 
assumed the role of intimate friend and adviser of the all-powerful premier.</p>

<p class="fst">In the ultra-conservative third Duma he was elected president, 
and as such had opportunity to study closely not only the bureaucratic apparatus 
of the Russian empire, but the Czar himself and his <i>entourage</i>. 
Independent and courageous, possessed of great political intuition, Gutchkoff 
entered upon a sharp struggle with the "dark forces" surrounding the throne, 
directed at first against the irresponsible influence of the Grand Dukes, then 
against the all-powerful Rasputin.</p>

<p class="fst">Gutchkoff concentrated his energy mainly on questions of a 
military nature. Soon there formed around him a circle of capable young officers 
of the General Staff. This provoked suspicion and bitter hostility at the Court. 
The military figures close to Gutchkoff were nicknamed by the Empress Alexandra 
Feodorovna the "Young Turks." These "Young Turks" (including the generals Gurko 
and Polivanoff), together with several members of the Duma, accomplished a great 
deal for the reorganization of the Russian army and the improvement of the 
national defense.</p>

<p class="fst">But in time Gutchkoff and his friends became convinced that 
further serious work in the interest of the nation, particularly for the 
national defense, was well-nigh impossible under the existing regime.</p>

<p class="fst">The appointment of the utterly incapable Sukhomlinoff to the post 
of war minister, the constantly growing influence of the semi-illiterate 
peasant, Rasputin, in the handling of the most fundamental problems of the 
state, killed all hope in Gutchkoff for a peaceful, evolutionary solution of the 
constantly growing crisis of absolutism.</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless Gutchkoff did not desire to see the rise of an 
elemental revolutionary mass movement. Openly proclaiming his uncompromising 
hostility to the existing regime, the Octobrist leader stood aloof, however, 
from the country's growing revolutionary tendencies. He disapproved of them. In 
his opinion revolutionary chaos could be averted only by a struggle for 
political power on the part of the moderate and conservatively liberal middle 
classes of Russian society. Already before the War, in 1913, in the period of 
the fourth Duma, he summoned his party to this struggle. At the beginning of the 
War Gutchkoff appeared in East Prussia as a representative of the Red Cross. 
There he witnessed the first catastrophe of the Russian army and saw the 
destruction, near Soldan, of General Samsonoff's entire army and the crushing of 
the finest Guard Regiments, due to the criminal inefficiency and negligence of 
General Rennenkampf.</p>

<p class="fst">When he delivered his parting address, as minister of war in the 
Provisional Government, before the conference of delegates from the front, in 
the Tauride Palace, on April twelfth, Gutchkoff said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Already, in the autumn of 1914, I returned from the front a 
revolutionist."</p>

<p class="fst">Testifying before the Extraordinary Inquiry Commission of the 
Provisional Government, on August 15, 1917, Gutchkoff declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"When in the months preceding the Revolution some of my 
friends and I sought a way out of the situation, we believed that it was 
impossible under the existing circumstances to bring about, in any normal way, a 
change in the government and its reconstruction by the enlistment of public men 
commanding the confidence of the country, and that it was necessary to make a 
sharp turn in the direction of the removal of him who wielded supreme power. Too 
much guilt had accumulated on the shoulders of the Emperor, the Empress and 
those inextricably bound to them. Their characters gave no hope of the 
possibility of moving them to a wholesome political change. All this made it 
clear to me that the Emperor must vacate his throne."</p>

<p class="fst">In the winter of 1916-17 Gutchkoff was not merely thinking of 
revolt but was actively engaged in preparing it in cooperation with M. I. 
Terestchenko, a noted millionaire and philanthropist and the future minister of 
foreign affairs in the Provisional Government. Together with General Krimoff, 
organizer of the subsequent Korniloff rebellion, he promoted plans for a coup 
d'état, sensing the advance of a catastrophe. The execution of the plans was 
delayed, and instead of a change of the reigning monarchs, the entire dynasty 
was swept away by the uprising of the people.</p>

<p class="fst">It was naturally impossible after that for Gutchkoff and his 
friends to remain aloof from the Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">With this moment began Gutchkoff's personal tragedy which, 
however, exemplified with particular clarity the tragedy experienced by all the 
people of his circle and his class in the Revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">They had expected a political upheaval which, by changing the 
system of government, was to transfer all political power into the hands of the 
centrist, the moderate-conservative and liberal elements of Russian society, 
which up until March 12, 1917, dominated the whole political life of the 
country, in the Duma, in the zemstvos, in the cities and in the press. Instead, 
Russia went through a social earthquake, which shook and shattered all the 
strata of the social order. Not only the conservative part but the whole of 
liberal Russia suddenly appeared as a mere fragmentary remnant of the destroyed 
monarchy. A new force, the democracy, and not so much the political, as the 
social and labor democracy, came into power, although it was not yet able to 
take this power into its hands.</p>

<p class="fst">In the chaos of the new political tendencies and aspirations, 
which were only beginning to take form, Gutchkoff found himself alone, a 
stranger to all. He himself did not think of his past, but many others did, for 
in the broad, popular historical consciousness Gutchkoff was remembered mostly 
as the instigator of the cruel Stolypin reaction which followed upon the 
dissolution of the first Duma.</p>

<p class="fst">Before the Revolution the object of an uncompromising hatred on 
the part of the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, Rasputin and Vyroubova, Gutchkoff 
after the Revolution immediately fell under the suspicion of the representatives 
of the Soviet democracy and their adherents. Yet the basic problem of the state 
after the Revolution consisted in the quickest possible restoration of authority 
in the land. An old, traditional government can continue, for a long time, to 
govern the state by mere mechanical force and inertia of the administrative 
apparatus. But here, too, a psychological break with the population, the absence 
of confidence in the government and in the genuineness of its intentions, in the 
long run bring about the end experienced by France in 1789, by Russia in 1917 
and by Germany in 1918. But a government born of revolution or of a coup 
d'état&#8212;it makes no difference which&#8212;and not possessing as yet any apparatus of 
compulsion, exists in reality only in so far as it finds a living contact with 
the country, only in so far as it is trusted by the people themselves and its 
orders and instructions are accepted by the millions not because of the 
conviction of force but by the force of conviction.</p>

<p class="fst">The austere, retiring, strange and uncouth Gutchkoff was least of 
all capable of convincing the multitude. He was not believed, and he realized 
this painfully.</p>

<p class="fst">Between Gutchkoff, as war minister, and the army there developed 
at once an unhealthy and abnormal relationship. It had been the belief that 
Gutchkoff, being close to high army circles (at any rate to many of the more 
talented officers of the General Staff), would administer the army well. It soon 
became clear, however, that what was necessary was not the usual kind of 
administration on the basis of the accepted principles of command and obedience, 
but first and foremost the restoration of the lost authority of the officers. It 
was necessary to place between subordinates and commanders, between the soldier 
and the officer, some kind of a third, connecting force. To do this it was 
essential first to gain the confidence of the troops. How was this to be done? 
As Gutchkoff saw it, it was to be done by deeds, by showing that the first war 
minister of the Revolution stood for a new order in the army.</p>

<h4>MILITARY REFORMS</h4>

<p class="fst">All the so-called reforms in the army, after the Revolution, were 
carried out during Gutchkoff's incumbency of the War Ministry, in cooperation 
with a special commission which included representatives of the Soviet and army 
committees, and was headed by General Polivanoff, who had been for a time 
minister of war during the War and the assistant war minister under the third 
Duma.</p>

<p class="fst">Polivanoff, as I have already indicated, was a member of 
Gutchkoff's circle. For that reason he had been regarded at Court with 
unconcealed hostility. A man of unquestionable ability and a brilliant 
administrator, Polivanoff, after sensing the prevailing revolutionary 
sentiments, joined Gutchkoff in the struggle for the restoration of the 
discipline and fighting capacity of the army, but with methods extremely 
dangerous. He set out to gain the confidence of the troops in the new War 
Minister by the maximum of possible and, sometimes, impossible concessions to 
demands presented not so much by committees from the front, as by the Petrograd 
Soviet. In these concessions Polivanoff went further than the War Minister.</p>

<p class="fst">In reality, all the reforms promoted by Gutchkoff and Polivanoff 
constituted merely the affirmation of what was already the existing order in the 
army after the Revolution. Naturally, the registration of all the revolutionary 
"conquests" in the army, as reflected in the work of Polivanoff's commission and 
the revolutionary orders of the War Minister, did not raise by a single iota the 
authority in the army of the representatives of the new government.</p>

<p class="fst">I repeat: the crux of the situation lay not in reforms but in the 
want of confidence in the new government. In the absence of the moral authority 
necessary to force a change in the sentiments of the masses there remained only 
the solution of drifting along with the current, in the hope that somehow, by 
means of some miracle, a "strong" man would appear, who, at one or two blows, 
supporting himself upon two or three old, solid traditions of his regiments, 
would disperse this whole "revolutionary canaille."</p>

<p class="fst">But the "strong" man was not in sight. General Korniloff, 
appointed the first commander of the Petrograd military district, was unable to 
handle the garrison, and early in May he returned to the front. Meanwhile the 
policy of adjustment even to the most moderate demands of the rank and file of 
the army, which had lost all equilibrium, was destroying the authority of 
Gutchkoff and Polivanoff in those circles where they could possibly have had 
it&#8212;the high command of the army.</p>

<h4>GUTCHKOFF'S RESIGNATION</h4>

<p class="fst">After two months of tragic misunderstanding Gutchkoff and his 
military assistants found themselves in an <i>impasse</i>. There were no more 
moves left for them. The final fruit of Polivanoff's creation&#8212;"the Declaration 
of the Rights of Soldiers"&#8212;already actually in force, was rejected by Gutchkoff, 
who refused to sign it. As a matter of fact the declaration was an artificial 
attempt to steer the sentiments of the army in the only way Gutchkoff could 
follow.</p>

<p class="fst">On his own initiative, without informing the Provisional 
Government, the Minister of War called a conference of all the army commanders, 
headed by General Alexeyeff, as commander-in-chief. The conference, which was to 
meet on or about May fifteenth, was to express its confidence in the War 
Minister who was about to resign, in a form closely resembling an ultimatum.</p>

<p class="fst">On May twelfth, exactly two months after the official beginning 
of the Revolution, Gutchkoff submitted his resignation in a letter to Prince 
Lvoff, the Premier. The letter produced a very painful impression on the public. 
Its main point was that the Minister of War could no longer carry the 
responsibility for the further destruction of the country. On the same day, in 
his final address as war minister, before the first conference of delegates from 
the front, Gutchkoff drew a shocking picture of the past and present of the 
Russian army, expressing his despair frankly and courageously. It would be sheer 
madness, he declared, to follow any longer the road taken by the Russian 
Revolution in the first two months. Speaking of the reforms in the army, the 
departing minister admitted openly: "We have now reached the fatal point beyond 
which lies not the rehabilitation of the army but its destruction."</p>

<p class="fst">I must say that despite the difference in our political past and 
our position in the Revolution I did not want Gutchkoff's departure, for I 
valued in him his great political intuition and the ability to approach the 
solution of political problems in a manner free from all dogmatic and partisan 
considerations. Only such men were then needed in Russia. The psychological 
change which had begun to mature in the soul of the revolutionary democracy 
after the experience on the Stokhod, gave me firm confidence that together with 
the healthy development of a national consciousness in the masses would come 
also the strenthening of confidence in the War Minister.</p>

<p class="fst">Accidentally, on May twelfth, as I was on my way to a meeting of 
the conference of delegates from the front, at which Gutchkoff was to speak, my 
automobile overtook that of Gutchkoff and I decided to make an effort to 
persuade Gutchkoff not to leave the Provisional Government. I changed into his 
machine and began to plead with him. But my pleading was in vain.</p>

<p class="fst">Nothing came of the second part of Gutchkoff's strategic 
maneuver. He resigned, but the conference of army commanders, which met in 
Petrograd, May sixteenth to seventeenth, refused to support Gutchkoff in his 
complaints against the Provisional Government. This first effort to bring the 
"strong will" of the fighting generals to bear upon the "lack of will-power" of 
the revolutionary government failed.</p>

<h4>MY FIRST DAYS IN THE WAR MINISTRY</h4>

<p class="fst">However, this effort did not end favorably for me. I was 
compelled to assume the war portfolio, with the difficult legacy left behind by 
Polivanoff and Gutchkoff. I realize now that it was perhaps the premonition of 
this, my greatest trial, which prompted me in my effort to prevail upon 
Gutchkoff not to leave the Provisional Government. Of course, if there had been 
a single man among the commanders at the front possessing the unqualified 
confidence of the rank and file, the question of finding a successor to 
Gutchkoff would have been easily settled. But the modern war of anonymous <i>
communiqués</i> had not produced such a hero. General Headquarters, headed by 
General Alexeyeff, as well as the entire commanding corps, demanded the 
appointment of a civilian as war minister.</p>

<p class="fst">Does not this demand of the generals illustrate better than 
anything else the abnormality of the position occupied at that time by the army 
commanders at the front and the fact that they themselves understood it? What 
was required then was a buffer between the commanding corps and the rank and 
file. It became my fate to be the buffer, with all the inevitable consequences 
confronting any one who puts his head between the hammer and the anvil.</p>

<p class="fst">But there was no time to do much thinking then. Moreover, all 
considerations were quickly ended. In reply to the question of Prince Lvoff as 
to whom, among the civilians available, the high command would recommend for the 
War Ministry, General Alexeyeff replied: "The first candidate of the high 
command is Kerensky."</p>

<p class="fst">The task placed upon me as War Minister by the Provisional 
Government was in brief this: restoration by all means at hand of the fighting 
capacity of the army. To accomplish this I was to move the army to an offensive, 
sparing no efforts.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course my task would have been quite impossible if at that 
time, in the middle of May, there had not appeared in the masses the marked 
evidences of the deep psychological change produced by the Stokhod experience. 
The resolutions of various Soviets, army committees and the declarations of 
delegations arriving in Petrograd from the front, all spoke of but one thing: 
the imperative need of restoring the fighting capacity of the army and the 
productive capacity of the workers, as essential prerequisites to the defense of 
the country.</p>

<p class="fst">To be sure, these healthy political and national tendencies did 
not affect all the active forces of the nation. The propaganda of the Bolsheviki 
and the work of German agents&#8212;which frequently meant one and the same thing&#8212;the 
war weariness and, above all, the prolongation of the War, which we could not 
stop, continued to batter and to shatter the country. A feeling of despair 
frequently gripped every one of us. Immediately preceding my appointment as 
minister of war, on the very day of Gutchkoff's resignation, I declared before 
the same conference of army delegates at which Gutchkoff delivered his swan 
song:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Is it really possible that Free Russia is only a country of 
mutinous slaves? I grieve that I did not die two months ago, in the first hour 
of the Revolution. For then I would have departed in the belief that a new life 
had at last come upon Russia, that we had learned to govern our country without 
the knout and the club, in mutual respect, and not as we used to be governed."</p>

<p class="fst">But from such emotion of despair grew and matured, parallel with 
the forces of dissolution, new social bonds. New creative possibilities were 
born, summoning all to work and effort. Then possibilities gave us faith in the 
triumph of reason over the dark madness of some and the deliberate treason of 
others.</p>

<p class="fst">On assuming my duties at the War Ministry, I first of all issued 
an order to the sulking members of the commanding corps forbidding the 
resignation of any officers of the army in the field. This measure nipped in the 
bud the intention of certain high commanders to resign by way of protest against 
the official publication of the "Declaration of the Rights of Soldiers." I 
believed that discipline was to be demanded first from people who by virtue of 
their position should have served as models of the performance of duty. 
Moreover, it was quite impossible to stop publication of the notorious 
declaration, first, because it had already long been published by the <i>
Izvestia</i> of the Petrograd Soviet, and second, because Polivanoff and 
Gutchkoff had made the official and categorical promise to the Soviet and army 
committees that the declaration would be put into effect, stating that the delay 
in doing so was due entirely to causes of a technical nature.</p>

<p class="fst">After putting a stop to the sulking attitude of the generals, I 
immediately published the "Declaration of the Rights of Soldiers." But, under my 
revision of it, the declaration received an interpretation which prompted Lenin, 
in the
<i>Pravda</i>, to term it the "Declaration of the Lack of Rights of Soldiers" 
and to begin a mad campaign against the new war minister. The fourteenth point 
of the declaration, excluded originally by General Polivanoff, on the demand of 
the Soviet, but restored by me, declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"At times of action the commander has the right to apply any 
measures, including the use of armed force, against subordinates who fail to 
obey his orders."</p>

<p class="fst">This point was the first move towards restoration of the power 
and authority of commanders. But even the most courageous officers did not for a 
long time venture to use this power. In addition to this fundamental change, the 
eighteenth point of the revised declaration placed the right of appointment and 
removal exclusively in the hands of commanders, and omitted the clause of the 
Polivanoff original which vested the army committees with the right of 
recommendation and rejection of appointees. Thus I did away with the right of 
subordinates to participate in the appointment of their superiors.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, in the very first days of my duties as War Minister, an 
end was put to the "dual authority" prevailing in the administration of the 
Petrograd garrison.</p>

<p class="fst">During the two months of General Korniloff's service as commander 
of the Petrograd military district, the Military Commission of the Duma and the 
soldiers' section of the Soviet exercised jointly the right of control over the 
Petrograd garrison. All the efforts made by Gutchkoff and Korniloff to put a 
stop to this truly inadmissible interference of public bodies in the activities 
of the district military staff resulted in failure. On the contrary, the 
meddling of the Soviet in the business of the commander grew hand in hand with 
the growing lack of confidence in the War Minister. General Korniloff made all 
sorts of concessions to the Soviet. On one occasion he announced in the press 
that he "does not undertake a serious move in the matter of the inner 
administration of the garrison without previous agreement with the Soviet of 
Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies, through the instrumentality of its executive 
organ." He agreed also to the establishment of a kind of controlling agency by 
the Soviet, which was attached to the staff. But all this led to nothing. On May 
twelfth, the day of Gutchkoff's resignation, the Soviet, through the 
representatives of its executive committee, laid claim to the function of 
countersigning all orders of the district commander concerning the movement and 
transfer of troops.</p>

<p class="fst">This was the demand that broke General Korniloff's patience. He 
resigned.</p>

<p class="fst">My desire to free the staff of the Petrograd military district 
from interference by the Soviet was soon carried out.</p>

<p class="fst">From the very beginning of the Revolution, the Duma, followed by 
the Soviet, began dispatching its representatives to the front, where their 
function was to explain events in Petrograd and help promote contact between the 
army and the forces of the Revolution. The Duma representatives had little 
success among the soldiers at the front and they soon ceased their activities. 
But the Soviet representatives became, to all intents and purposes, Soviet 
commissars in the army.</p>

<p class="fst">This decline of the authority of the Duma's representatives at 
the front, simultaneously with the rise of the authority of the Soviet's 
representatives, together with the experience suffered by Colonel Engelhardt, 
who saw the various regulations and orders promulgated by him paralleled by 
similar measures by the Soviet, shows that all organizations born of the 
Revolution resorted to the same measures and that the result was different only 
because the influence wielded by organizations of the Duma fell, in the course 
of the revolutionary developments, to zero, while that of the Soviet rose to the 
boiling point.</p>

<p class="fst">The preservation at the front of the institution of Soviet 
commissars was likewise intolerable, for under the relations which had developed 
between the rank and file and the officers, the commissars, in the summer of 
1917, had to carry altogether too great a responsibility. For that reason these 
commissars had to be made responsible, while at the front, directly to the 
government. This became a fact with my assumption of the war portfolio.</p>

<p class="fst">Finally, in the very first days of my work as Minister of War I 
stopped the stream of revolutionary reforms emanating from General Polivanoff's 
commission by the simple device of abolishing it.</p>

<p class="fst">My further work in the Ministry of War and Marine consisted in 
the gradual liquidation of the "revolutionary" measures of General Polivanoff. 
Beginning with the middle of May, the army began to return gradually to a normal 
military order.</p>

<p class="fst">At first glance my "conservatism," coming upon the "radicalism" 
of Gutchkoff, may appear paradoxical. As a representative of the Left, the 
normal procedure would have been for me to pursue a radical policy. But what may 
appear abnormal under normal conditions, becomes in the abnormal revolutionary 
situation but a normal development of events. My entrance into the War Ministry 
marked the end of the period of destruction and the beginning of the period of 
construction, not only in the army, but in the country as a whole.</p>

<p class="fst">All my initial measures were undertaken merely with the object of 
clearing the field for my basic activity, the bringing about of a sharp change 
in the attitude and sentiment of the army. This required my presence? at the 
front and not in Petrograd. From the first day of my appointment as Minister of 
War and up to my assumption of the premiership, after the first Bolshevist 
uprising, July sixteenth to twentieth, I spent the greater part of my time on 
various parts of the front, taking no part, on my brief returns to Petrograd, in 
the work of the Provisional Government so far as internal matters were 
concerned.</p>

<p class="fst">It is now the fashion not only in conservative, but also in 
Bolshevist circles, to refer to me ironically as the "persuader-in-chief."</p>

<p class="fst">I do not see anything opprobrious, ridiculous or insulting in 
this term. For, if I was compelled for weeks at a time to devote myself to the 
inspection of army after army, corps after corps and division after division, if 
in addition to the regular work of a war minister at the front I was obliged to 
waste time in conversations with soldiers and in addresses before thousands of 
troops, I did so not on my own volition, but on the insistent and, at times, 
tearful demands of the high commanders.</p>

<p class="fst">I remember particularly one incident on the Galician Front, in 
the region of the eleventh army, involving a certain Guard division. This 
division was beyond all hope of redemption. What it required was not persuasion 
but the application of armed force. After inspecting a neighboring division and 
addressing the troops, I flatly declined to visit the division in question, 
realizing that it would be a waste of time to enter into discussions with its 
Bolshevist agitators. The old, gray-haired general, commander of the division, 
who had come to invite me to visit his command, lost all self-control, grew pale 
and began to tremble.</p>

<p class="fst">"Mr. Minister," he pleaded, "if you do not come they will say it 
is my fault. There will be no living for me then. In God's name do come to us."</p>

<p class="fst">What was there left for me to do, considering my "weakness" and 
"lack of will-power"? Naturally, I visited the hopelessly infected division and, 
in the interests of the safety of the commanders, addressed the troops, quite 
conscious of the uselessness of my effort in this case. Several days later the 
commissar of the war minister attached to the division, was obliged to use force 
in dissolving it, as should have been done from the very beginning.</p>

<p class="fst">No doubt the position of the commanders at the front was quite 
intolerable&#8212;to command troops after having lost the capacity to command; to 
prepare the soldier mass for action at a time when all such preparation was 
regarded by the soldiers almost as "treason to the new order" and as 
"counter-revolution"; to be compelled to tolerate the stream of poisonous 
Bolshevist slander; to feel the suspicion of the representatives of the Soviet 
democracy&#8212;all this was sufficient to undermine the equilibrium of and infuriate 
any man. Add to this the fact that in the spring of 1917 the Russian officer 
corps was already undermined and crippled by three years of bitter, unsuccessful 
fighting and you have some conception of the situation.</p>

<p class="fst">The Revolution turned its back on the regular officers. This was 
perhaps historically inevitable but extremely tragic for those who were 
compelled to experience it. And it undoubtedly had a fatal effect on the 
development of the events of the Revolution. The overwhelming majority of 
Russia's officers took no part in preparing the Revolution. The revolutionary 
tempest surprised them to a greater extent than was the case with those 
civilians who were at least in some measure able to sense the political and 
social sentiments of the country. But, as I have already said, psychologically 
the officers were prepared for a break with the dynasty. For this reason, 
although they did not greet the new situation gladly, they accepted it, at any 
rate, without resistance. Soon after, however, every officer went through what 
was really a repetition of the spiritual tragedy of Gutchkoff and his immediate 
assistants. There was, however, one difference, namely&#8212;the attitude of distrust 
on the part of the troops in the trenches towards their officers did not express 
itself in the resolutions and declarations, but very frequently in direct, 
brutal and humiliating action.</p>

<p class="fst">Losing heart, as General Brusiloff was wont to say, suddenly 
perceiving in the soldier a strange and even hostile creature, the officers 
sought the aid of the civilian rear, hoping there to find a new road to the 
soldier's soul.</p>

<p class="fst">More than once did I receive from various commanding generals 
urgent telegrams requesting the dispatch of a commissar to his troops, 
indicating at the same time a preference for former "political offenders," who 
could not possibly be suspected of "counterrevolutionary schemes," even when 
demanding the restoration of discipline and exorting the troops to action.</p>
