<h2><a name="h1">CHAPTER VIII</a><br>
<small>FIRST VISITS TO THE ARMY</small></h2>

<p class="fst">AFTER short trips to the Caucasus Front at the very beginning of 
the War and to the Western Front in 1915, I again saw the army in May, 1917. 
Having repaired to some extent the ministerial machine and reorganized the 
administration of the Petrograd military district, I left, on May twentieth, for 
the Galician Front, where General Brusiloff was in command.</p>

<p class="fst">This front had remained in a better state of preservation than 
any other after the revolutionary explosion, but here, too, one beheld a 
terrible picture of destruction. It seemed as if the army had forgotten the 
enemy and turned its face towards the interior of the country, its attention 
riveted on what was going on there.</p>

<p class="fst">There was neither the crack of machine guns nor the exchange of 
artillery fire. The trenches were deserted. All preparatory work for offensive 
operations had been abandoned. With their uniforms in ludicrous disorder, 
thousands of troops were devoting their time to interminable meetings. Most of 
the officers seemed completely confused. The local Galician population was 
looking on in surprise and amusement.</p>

<p class="fst">But beneath this discouraging picture of destruction there was 
already being kindled a new will to action. Like General Brusiloff, the officers 
who had retained their self-possession and ignored the countless blows to their 
self-respect, continued to toil with immeasurable enthusiasm and self-sacrifice 
for the creation of new spiritual and human contacts between the commanders and 
the troops. From morning till night many commanders strove to gain the ear of 
their soldiers, in an effort to convince them of the necessity of fighting for 
the preservation of the country and its newly won liberty. The commissars of the 
War Ministry and the local army committees were working feverishly in the same 
direction. In general, the Galician army, while not capable of active 
operations, was rapidly developing the will to action.</p>

<p class="fst">I remember the army conference at Kamenetz-Podolsk, General 
Brusiloff's headquarters. The huge hall was filled with hundreds of soldier 
delegates, sent from the most remote corners of the front. I beheld weary faces, 
feverish eyes, extraordinary tension. It was quite clear that before me were 
people who had experienced a great shock and, having lost the capacity to reason 
normally, were seeking for some sort of new justification of their continued 
sojourn in the trenches. In listening to the speeches of the delegates and the 
representatives of the army committees, of Brusiloff himself, and of the 
Bolsheviki who were led by the subsequently notorious Krilenko, I felt as if I 
were putting my hand to the very heart of the army. What the army was 
experiencing at that time, in the very deepest recesses of its consciousness, 
was a great, irresistible temptation, too great for human powers to endure.</p>

<p class="fst">After three years of the cruelest suffering, the millions of 
soldiers, exhausted to the last degree by the tortures of war, found themselves 
confronted suddenly with the questions: "What are we dying for? Must we die?"</p>

<p class="fst">To put these questions to a man who must be ready and willing to 
die at any moment, to put before him anew, and in the midst of war, the question 
of the meaning of his sacrifice implied the paralysis of his will to action. Man 
can endure war and remain in the trenches under artillery fire only when he does 
not reason, when he does not think of the aims or, to be more correct, when he 
is animated by an unshakable, almost automatic conviction of the inevitability 
and necessity of sacrifice, for the sake of an already clear and established 
purpose, no longer subject to discussion. It is too late to think of war aims 
and to build up an "ideology of war" when you are already being called upon to 
stop the enemy's bullets.</p>

<p class="fst">No army can withstand such a temptation without grievous 
consequences. Everything else which was destroying the army&#8212;persecution of the 
officers, mutinies, the Bolshevization of various units, the interminable 
meetings, etc., was only the painful expression of that terrible struggle for 
life which gripped the soul of every soldier. He suddenly perceived an 
opportunity to justify morally his human weakness, his well-nigh unconquerable, 
instinctive desire to run away from those disgusting, horrible trenches. For the 
army to fight again meant to conquer anew the animal in man, to find anew some 
sort of unquestionable slogan of war that would make it possible again for 
everybody to look death in the face calmly and unflinchingly.</p>

<p class="fst">For the sake of the nation's life it was necessary to restore the 
army's will to die.</p>

<p class="fst">"Forward to the battle for freedom! I summon you not to a feast 
but to death!"</p>

<p class="fst">These were the words I used before the conference at 
Kamenetz-Podolsk. These words were also the keynote of all my addresses before 
the troops in the front line positions.</p>

<p class="fst">"We call you to social revolution! We summon you not to die for 
others but to destroy others, to destroy your class enemies in the rear!"</p>

<p class="fst">This counter slogan of Lenin carried with it terrible force, for 
it justified beforehand the animal fear of death which lurks in the heart of 
even the bravest. It supplied the mind with arguments in support of everything 
that was dark, cowardly and selfish in the army.</p>

<p class="fst">There is nothing remarkable in the fact that in the end, after 
months of bitter struggle, the most ignorant of the masses preferred murder and 
rapine and followed the leaders of the Bolshevist counter-revolution. The 
remarkable thing was the mighty wave of patriotic self-abnegation which swept 
the army at the front in the summer of 1917.</p>

<p class="fst">Incidentally, the German General Staff sensed at once the change 
on the Russian Front. Immediately upon my appointment as Minister of War, the 
transfer of German troops from the Eastern Front to the West was stopped. By the 
end of May the movement and concentration of the German forces was in the 
opposite direction.</p>

<p class="fst">Accompanied by several officers, General Brusiloff and I made an 
inspection of the army by automobile. Our problem was the examination of those 
forces which in about a month were to take the offensive. In two or three days 
we covered scores of positions.</p>

<p class="fst">The mode of inspection was always the same: We walked down the 
line, swinging around into the heart of the ranks to an improvised platform. On 
our mounting the platform, came the word of command and from all sides thousands 
of troops would rush towards us, surrounding the platform in a huge circle. The 
commanders spoke first, followed by committee delegates. Then I came, and then 
the discontented, hesitating mass of armed human beings in gray, confused in 
mind and weary in body and spirit, would become animated by a kind of new life. 
Their souls would become aglow with enthusiasm which at times reached the peaks 
of mad ecstasy. It was not always easy to escape from this raging sea of human 
beings to our automobile and speed away to the next inspection.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course, the new mood would not last long. But something of it 
remained. And wherever there were capable men among the commanders, commissars 
and army committees, strong centers of new discipline and a revived military 
psychology were created.</p>

<p class="fst">The majority of the troops were divided into two categories. On 
one side were men strong of will and eager for heroic action. From these were 
formed voluntary units calling themselves "Battalions of Death," "Detachments of 
Exemplary Sacrifice," etc. On the other side were whole units who were dominated 
by Bolshevist agitators. However, they gave us real trouble only when led by 
officers of the character of the notorious Dzevaltovsky, who managed, on one 
occasion, to bring under his unbridled influence the entire Grenadier Regiment 
of the Guards. Such dangerously infected units were to be found all along the 
front, and my commissars were compelled to wage real war against them, resorting 
even to artillery bombardment.</p>

<p class="fst">The officers at the front were divided into three groups. The 
majority were well-intentioned but confused and unable to lead; the minority 
were men who grasped the new situation and managed to find a way of approaching 
the heart and mind of the soldier; and, finally, there was a group hostile to 
the Revolution as a whole, gloating over its failures and sabotaging its 
successes. Among this group in particular were to be found, more frequently than 
anywhere else, men who, foreseeing future developments, quite cynically adjusted 
themselves to the new committee regulations, without regard to their calling as 
officers and their self-respect.</p>

<p class="fst">On the eve of my departure from the Galician Front for Odessa and 
Sebastopol, I was returning with General Brusiloff from a tour of inspection. We 
were in an open automobile, in a heavy downpour, drenched and weary. General 
Brusiloff was not a politician, but "by the grace of God" a leader of great 
courage and will-power. He was not given to much conversation, but he understood 
well the character of the soldier and sensed quickly every change in the spirit 
of the army. Under the unceasing beating of the rain, we discussed long and 
intimately that which at that time was stirring and torturing the army and all 
Russians.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course, like every strong man, Brusiloff was rather vain. I 
suppose that, to some extent, he was trying to impress me by playing up to my 
own views, as he described clearly and vividly the general situation at the 
front, his plans and the characteristics of the military commanders. But 
Brusiloff loved Russia too much to misrepresent fundamentals. And the 
fundamentals, as he saw them, coincided not only with my own sentiments, but 
with those of all who were struggling desperately to bring the Russian army back 
to life and action. It was not enough to talk, to analyze and engage in 
criticism (as General Alexeyeff, then commander-in-chief, was doing). It was 
necessary to create, to act and to take risks.</p>

<p class="fst">Here, in the automobile, on the road from the front to Tarnopol, 
we definitely decided upon the offensive. I also made up my mind that with the 
beginning of the offensive General Brusiloff would no longer be on the Galician 
Front, but at General Headquarters at Mohileff. As commander-in-chief, I did not 
mention the matter to Brusiloff, as it was necessary first to obtain the consent 
of the Provisional Government to the removal of General Alexeyeff.</p>

<p class="fst">From the Southwestern Front I went to Odessa, and thence to 
Sebastopol, to adjust differences between the crews of the Black Sea Fleet and 
Admiral Kolchak, the commander.</p>

<h4>THE BLACK SEA DRAMA</h4>

<p class="fst">Admiral Kolchak was a brilliant sailor, the darling of the 
officers, and loved by his men. At the beginning of the Revolution he quickly 
oriented himself in the new environment and saved the Black Sea Fleet from the 
horrors experienced by the Baltic Fleet. Of course, in Sebastopol, as everywhere 
else, committees were formed. There was the Central Committee of the Black Sea 
Fleet, backed by a network of committees on the various vessels and among the 
commands on shore. But these committees consisted of both officers and men. 
Admiral Kolchak's own relations with the Central Committee were excellent.</p>

<p class="fst">The sentiments prevailing in the Black Sea Fleet can be gleaned 
from the fact that as late as at the end of May, when I came to Sebastopol, 
there were many, not only among the officers but also among the men, who were 
eager for a landing operation on the Bosporus. The commands of the Black Sea 
Fleet remained an impregnable fortress against the propaganda of German and 
Bolshevist agents. It was from the shores of the Black Sea that the first calls 
to duty and discipline were sent to the army. And from the Black Sea Fleet came 
whole delegations to the front for propaganda of defense and in support of the 
offensive. In view of this attitude of the respective commands, any disagreement 
between Kolchak and the committees seemed impossible. Nevertheless, quite 
unexpectedly, a conflict developed.</p>

<p class="fst">I cannot recall now the issue in question. I believe it concerned 
some interference, on the part of the Central Committee, in the admiral's 
administrative duties. Moreover, the exact issue is not important. The important 
thing was the actual cause. Accustomed to general admiration and to absolute 
authority, the admiral could not reconcile himself to the realization that now 
he had a competitor&#8212;the Central Committee. The disagreement was not so much 
political as psychological.</p>

<p class="fst">With all his great energy, Admiral Kolchak was somewhat 
effeminate, capricious and slightly hysterical. En route in a destroyer from 
Odessa to Sebastopol, closeted in a small cabin, we had a long conversation. All 
the reasons he brought forth in support of his opinion that there was nothing 
for him to do but to resign did not bear criticism. All his complaints were 
trifles compared with the difficulties being experienced by the commanders at 
the front and in the Baltic Fleet. One by one I combated his conclusions. And 
only at the very end of the conversation did he give vent to a cry that came 
from the depths of a broken heart:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"To them [<i>i.e.</i>, to the sailors] the Central Committee 
means more than I do, and I no longer wish to have anything to do with them. I 
do not love them any more."</p>

<p class="fst">The stern eyes of the admiral filled with tears.</p>

<p class="fst">On my arrival at Sebastopol I became convinced that the leaders 
of the Central Committee, officers and men alike, were far removed from any 
thought of Kolchak's departure. "He must only realize," the committee members 
told me, "that for the present we are absolutely necessary to him and that it is 
quite impossible to dissolve the committee. Such action would mean the beginning 
of disorganization of the commands, an unexpected victory for the Bolsheviki."</p>

<p class="fst">This time my mission was successful. Admiral Kolchak made peace 
with the Central Committee and it seemed that everything remained as it was. But 
it only seemed so. A breach remained, and in exactly one month it widened into a 
gulf which forever parted Admiral Kolchak from his beloved fleet. A crisis began 
to develop in the soul of the brilliant sailor from which he emerged on land as 
the downright reactionary "dictator" of Siberia.</p>

<p class="fst">I have described this Kolchak episode in detail, in order to make 
it clear how even the best of the commanders were unable to reconcile themselves 
to the unavoidable difficulties of the transitional revolutionary period. 
Speaking in general, we may say that if the enlightened, cultured upper elements 
of Russia had shown greater patience at the beginning of the Revolution, the 
Bolsheviki would have perhaps found it more difficult to destroy Russia. After 
all the experiences of the Bolshevist terror for the past ten years, the 
"excesses" of the Revolution, which provoked such a storm of anger and 
resentment among many political and military leaders of Russia in the summer of 
1917, appear now as mere trifles.</p>

<h4>ON THE NORTHERN FRONT</h4>

<p class="fst">From Sebastopol I went to Kiev, where a sharp collision with the 
Ukrainian separatists was brewing. From Kiev I proceeded to General Headquarters 
at Mohileff, where my conversations with General Alexeyeff convinced me finally 
of the necessity of a change in the post of commander-in-chief. From Mohileff I 
returned to Petrograd for one day, where I put through Brusiloff's appointment, 
and departed immediately for the Northern Front.</p>

<p class="fst">Here, in the region of the eleventh army, occupying a position in 
the direction of Mitau, occurred an incident which illustrates vividly the 
subconscious processes at the front.</p>

<p class="fst">The commander of the eleventh army was the Bulgarian, General 
Radko-Dmitrieff, hero of the Balkan War of 1912-13, who had joined the Russian 
service. He was a grizzled warrior, who loved the soldier and knew how to handle 
him. Nevertheless, after the Revolution, he felt the sudden rise of a wall 
between himself and his troops. And frequently, to his surprise, his jocular 
words of encouragement to the soldiers provoked only irritation instead of the 
previous merriment and laughter.</p>

<p class="fst">"Right in this neighborhood, not very far from here," said the 
general to me as we were returning from the front line trenches, "in a certain 
regiment, there is an agitator. We cannot handle him,. He is demoralizing the 
whole regiment with his discussions about the land. Won't you please tackle 
him?"</p>

<p class="fst">We entered a dugout unobservable from the enemy positions and 
called a number of troops from the trenches.</p>

<p class="fst">Weary, growling faces surrounded us in a ring. We began to 
converse. Standing aloof, the little soldier who had won the ear of the 
regiment, made no effort to reply. His comrades thereupon pushed him forward. 
Voices:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Well, what's the matter? Here is your chance to speak in the 
presence of the minister himself."</p>

<p class="fst">Finally the little soldier spoke up:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"What I want to say is this: You say we must fight, so that 
the peasants may have the land, but of what use is the land to me, for instance, 
if I am killed?"</p>

<p class="fst">I realized immediately that all discussion and logic were of no 
use in this case. What confronted me here was the dark inside of a human being. 
The case was one in which personal interest, in its most naked form, was being 
preferred to sacrifice for the common good. The desirability and wisdom of such 
sacrifice does not lend itself to proof by word or reason. It can only be felt. 
The situation was rather difficult. To leave the little soldier without a reply 
was unthinkable. Where the logic of reason seemed powerless it was necessary to 
resort to the logic of emotion.</p>

<p class="fst">Silently I took a few steps forward in the direction of the 
little soldier. Turning to Radko-Dmitrieff I said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"General, I order you to remove this soldier immediately. Pack 
him off at once to his village. Let his fellow villagers know that the Russian 
Revolution has no need of cowards."</p>

<p class="fst">My surprising reply created a moving impression on all those 
present. The little soldier himself stood trembling, dumb and pale. And then he 
fell into a deep faint. Soon after I received a request from his officers to 
countermand the order for his removal. A profound change had come upon him. He 
was now an example of service to others.</p>

<p class="fst">From the eleventh army I proceeded to the region of the seventh 
army, where General Yurii Daniloff was in command, who for the first eighteen 
months of the War had been quartermaster general to the Grand Duke Nicholas 
Nicholayevitch, then commander-in-chief.</p>

<p class="fst">This general had not only strategic talent but considerable 
political acumen. He was one of the first and few among the high commanders to 
grasp the new soldier psychology at the front and managed to cooperate in 
constructive manner with the sound and patriotic majority of its army committee.</p>

<p class="fst">At that time General Daniloff found the front committees of great 
value, for in the neighboring fifth army there had arisen, early in the summer, 
a considerably strong Bolshevist propaganda organization. Particularly active in 
the destructive work of this organization, by means of promoting fraternization 
and the sowing of hostility against officers, was a certain hitherto unknown 
regimental surgeon, Skliansky.</p>

<p class="fst">At a big meeting in Dvinsk, of representatives of all the 
committees of the fifth army, and in the presence of the commander and his 
staff, I was called upon to speak. It was expected by all, from the commander to 
the privates, that "comrade" Skliansky, who had been so actively engaged in 
haranguing the committee and soldiers, would take this opportunity of fighting a 
verbal duel with the Minister of War.</p>

<p class="fst">The meeting proceeded. First the commander spoke, then the 
leaders of the army committee, followed by delegates from the trenches. But 
Skliansky kept silent. He not only showed no desire to expose the "imperialist" 
and "reactionary" efforts of the Provisional Government but stubbornly sought to 
keep as far as possible from the center. The incident appeared very much like a 
repetition of my experience with the little soldier in the eleventh army.</p>

<p class="fst">And, sure enough, the incomprehensible and inexplicable silence 
of the doctor finally angered the soldiers, particularly those from the 
trenches, who had been most subjected to the temptations of Bolshevist demagogy. 
I observed some kind of a movement around Skliansky.</p>

<p class="fst">Soon we noticed that a quiet but rather energetic exchange of 
remarks was in progress between him and his neighbors. Apparently the doctor was 
being called upon to do something which he refused to do.</p>

<p class="fst">At last it became clear what the scene was about. The soldiers 
were trying to force Skliansky to speak. Gradually they pushed him forward 
toward the commanders.</p>

<p class="fst">"Oh, no," we heard, "you will be kind enough to speak here. If 
what you've been telling us is the truth there is no need of fear. We'll hear 
now what you have to say."</p>

<p class="fst">"Comrade" Skliansky stood sheepishly confused amid peals of 
laughter. Finally, the hesitating leader of a world revolution from the fifth 
army was pushed on to the platform.</p>

<p class="fst">He was compelled to speak. What he said was the usual Bolshevist 
nonsense, but there was no emotion, no fire, no conviction in his words.</p>

<p class="fst">The end of the episode was very sad for "comrade" Skliansky and 
his lieutenants. His duel with the War Minister became known throughout the 
army, and in a light rather ridiculous so far as the Bolsheviki were concerned. 
Subsequently, the brave revolutionist Skliansky became assistant to the 
Commissar of War, Leon Trotsky.</p>

<p class="fst">After my tour of the front and two inspiring days in Moscow I 
returned on June fourteenth to Petrograd. It was necessary to finish some 
important government business and to return by the end of June to the Galician 
Front, for the offensive.</p>
