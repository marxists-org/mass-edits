<h2><a name="h1">CHAPTER IV</a><br>
<small>THE GOVERNMENT CRISIS</small></h2>

<p class="fst">AND so the Provisional Government, by means of legislative 
initiative, began to lay the foundations of the new democratic state. The work 
proceeded swiftly. Towards the end of the summer the new organic laws began to 
make themselves felt in the increasing systematization of the nation's political 
life and the strengthening of the administrative apparatus. But while this work 
was in progress it was necessary to live, <i>i.e.</i>, to command at the front, 
to restore order in the rear, to circumscribe and bring within the limits of the 
possible the flaming appetites of individual groups and classes. All these 
wanted all they could get&#8212;all liberty, all rights but no obligations.</p>

<p class="fst">This extremism, this lack of moderation in the demands made upon 
the government was to be explained by the fact that the population, never having 
participated in the government of the country and only now, for the first time, 
realizing its boundless power, believed that the government was omnipotent and 
that its resources were unlimited&#8212;now, as before, after three years of the wear 
and tear of war and of economic exhaustion. To stop the destructive sweep of the 
elemental revolutionary tempest it was necessary to reveal to the people all the 
wounds and ulcers of emaciated Russia, to rouse in the heart of every soldier, 
workman and peasant concern for Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">Not the egoistic instincts of capitalist Russia but the real 
interests of Russian democracy itself, just come into power, required the 
protection of industry from destructive experiments by the workers, the 
restoration of authority at the front and a struggle against anarchic sentiments 
in the village. The basic interests of Russia demanded from all citizens the 
greatest possible self-control and the subordination of all one's personal, 
class and caste interests to the fundamental problem of the moment&#8212;the salvation 
of the country and of the state.</p>

<p class="fst">Russia could escape from her insurmountable difficulties only in 
the measure in which the people developed the feeling of political discipline 
and political responsibility. In the development of this feeling in the masses, 
the government could play a great part, but only on the condition of growth and 
strengthening of confidence in the government. While an old, traditional organ 
of authority, supporting itself upon a strong administrative apparatus, can 
continue to exist for a long time, even after having lost the confidence of the 
country, no new government can possibly afford such a luxury, in the absence of 
even the simplest and most primitive instruments of compulsion. In this case, 
obedience to the demands of the new government depends entirely upon the good 
will of the people, who follow the instructions of the government only to the 
extent to which it has their confidence. The development of authority 
constituted the cardinal condition for Russia's safe emergence from the crisis 
of war and revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">However, the more intensively the organization and solidification 
of democratic organizations around the Soviets proceeded, the wider grew the 
psychological gulf between the revolutionary government and the revolutionary 
democracy in the Soviets. Every action of the government was regarded with 
suspicion by the leading circles of the Soviet and subjected to close 
examination from the point of view of the interests of the proletariat and of 
the "revolutionary people." The speeches and articles of the Soviet leaders, 
playing the role of a "benevolent" parliamentary opposition, in themselves 
contained nothing evil or criminal. Under normal conditions, with a parliament 
and a parliamentary majority to fall back upon, all this would have been even 
useful to the government. But the leaders who essayed the role of the opposition 
were in reality bound not to a minority but to a majority in the country. And 
this majority, untried and inexperienced in any parliamentary theories and party 
doctrines and having no conception of parliamentary practice, interpreted 
literally all the sharp criticisms directed against the government by the 
self-appointed opponents. The Soviet press sowed the wind of opposition and the 
government reaped the revolutionary storm.</p>

<p class="fst">This situation finally became impossible and intolerable. All the 
leading members of the Provisional Government understood well the source of the 
political tension and of the brewing crisis. They all understood that it was 
necessary to change the composition of the Provisional Government in a manner 
corresponding to the real disposition of forces in the country. Foreign Minister 
Miliukoff alone stuck to his own theory that all the power after the Revolution 
must belong to the representatives of those elements of Russian society which 
are termed, according to the nomenclature of socialist ideologists, the 
bourgeoisie.</p>

<h4>PAUL N. MILIUKOFF</h4>

<p class="fst">Miliukoff is one of the most striking and most brilliant figures 
of intellectual Russia. His name is inextricably bound with the last decades of 
the struggle against Czarism, to the history of which he added many brilliant 
pages.</p>

<p class="fst">An historian by nature, Paul N. Miliukoff is by temperament a 
statesman of great ability. In his youth he followed the call of science, but 
his fighting instinct, rather than police persecution, prompted him to alter his 
career. In the end, instead of a venerable scientist, Russia received in him one 
of her greatest political leaders. But the very historical attributes of his 
mind taught Miliukoff to understand political events post factum, to look at 
them more or less from the perspective of distance. Miliukoff sees life more 
clearly through a book or an historical document. Having analyzed the past, he 
proceeds to draw corresponding conclusions, in accordance with all the rules of 
political logic. Thus, having worked out his program, his strategic and tactical 
plan, Miliukoff proceeds to carry it out with all the fervor of a political 
leader who is thoroughly convinced of the wisdom of his judgment, failing to 
take into consideration, however, the circumstances of to-day and, what is 
frequently more important, of to-morrow.</p>

<p class="fst">This lack of political intuition is not an irreparable fault 
under normal conditions in one's political activity, but in periods when minutes 
mean years and months become equal to decades, when the link between to-day and 
to-morrow is broken, the clash between precise and well-ordered schemes of 
political activity and life rushing on at blinding speed becomes catastrophic.</p>

<p class="fst">P. N. Miliukoff came to the foreign office with a well conceived 
plan of foreign policy. In the autumn of 1916 this plan was still quite in 
place. But in March, 1917, it was of no more use or, rather, it became an 
historical document fit only for the archives. To put it more concretely: the 
trouble was not in the aims set by the first minister of foreign affairs of the 
Provisional Government but in the methods chosen by him in his struggle for 
their realization. The Russia that had to declaim daily about the Dardanelles, 
the cross on St. Sofia, and to whom it was necessary to speak constantly of war 
to a victorious conclusion&#8212; that Russia ceased to exist on March 12, 1917. The 
New Russia which had come to take her place, lived under a new war psychology 
and wanted to hear new war slogans and to set new war aims.</p>

<p class="fst">The fundamental change in the language of her diplomacy and her 
diplomatic methods, incumbent at that time upon the Provisional Government, did 
not, of course, in any way prejudice Russia's actions after victory. Victory has 
its own logic and creates in the victor its own psychology. In war, diplomacy is 
only one of the means of struggle, of war propaganda. It must speak in a 
language corresponding to the attitude and sentiments of the country at war.</p>

<p class="fst">"You may speak as you like and what you like," said Gutchkoff to 
Miliukoff at a meeting of the Provisional Government, "but say only that which 
bolsters up the fighting capacity of the front."</p>

<p class="fst">Even before that, early in April, on my way with Miliukoff to 
General Headquarters at Mohileff, I told him the same thing but in another way:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"It is necessary now to change entirely the language of all 
our diplomatic notes and declarations."</p>

<p class="fst">This opinion of an "inexperienced diplomat" provoked the horror 
of the new minister and of his associate, Prince G. Trubetzkoy, a professional 
diplomat.</p>

<p class="fst">My words and the "opportunist diplomacy" of Gutchkoff were not a 
misfortune for Russia. Its misfortune was Miliukoff's refusal to yield in form 
to the new national psychology in all his declarations.</p>

<h4>THE DISPUTE OVER WAR AIMS</h4>

<p class="fst">It would be of no interest to describe here in detail the 
casuistical dispute which continued for two months between Miliukoff and the 
Soviet, between the <i>
Rietch</i>, organ of the Constitutional-Democratic party and the
<i>Izvestia</i>, organ of the Soviet. The only interest this dispute has for us 
now lies not in its substance but in the consequences. At that time all those 
endless discussions&#8212;whether or not Russia's war aims had changed after the 
Revolution, whether or not Russia had in reality abandoned her claims to the 
Dardanelles, whether or not the Allies should be officially informed of the new 
war formula proclaimed solemnly to the Russian people by the Provisional 
Government on April ninth&#8212;reacted painfully on the nerves of the people, 
exhausted by the War, and provoked the greatest irritation. The Provisional 
Government itself had found the proper way of presenting Russia's war aims to 
the people in the following declaration:</p>

<p class="indentb">Leaving it entirely to the people, in close unity with the 
Allies, to decide all questions in connection with the World War and its 
solution, the Provisional Government believes it to be its right and duty to 
declare immediately that the aim of Free Russia is not domination over other 
peoples, not to deprive them of their national patrimony, not the forcible 
seizure of foreign territories, but the establishment of a stable peace on the 
basis of the self-determination of peoples. The Russian people do not seek the 
extension of their external power at the expense of other peoples, nor do they 
include in their aim the enslavement and humiliation of any other peoples.</p>

<p class="fst">This formula, which served as the basis of President Wilson's 
famous fourteen points, did, at any rate, reflect closely the idealistic 
aspirations of the Russian people as a whole for an early, just, democratic 
peace. At any rate, the Provisional Government's war aims manifesto had nothing 
in common with the former declarations on this question, which Russia had been 
accustomed to hear from the lips of the Czar's foreign minister, S. D. Sazonoff, 
and his successors during the War.</p>

<p class="fst">Nevertheless, the unanimous desire of the Provisional Government 
not to aggravate the differences about Russia's war aims, and to follow closely 
its solemn declaration, was not in any way reflected in Miliukoff's personal 
conduct and particularly in his policy as editor of his official party organ. 
Immediately upon the government's declaration of its war aims, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs let it.be known that this declaration, addressed to the Russian 
people, did not in any way bind him as minister of foreign affairs, in his 
policy. Miliukoff's declaration, coming upon that of the government, which had 
succeeded in satisfying and placating the Soviet leaders, produced the 
impression of a bomb explosion. A veritable verbal war ensued. And not Miliukoff 
alone but the authority of the government itself, which had barely begun to 
consolidate itself, was the sufferer.</p>

<p class="fst">The outburst of hatred against Miliukoff in the Soviet revealed 
the entire deep psychological crisis of the government, the crisis of lack of 
confidence, which began brewing on the very first day of the Revolution, due to 
the contradiction between the composition of the government and the disposition 
of forces in the country, and which had to be eliminated if the country was to 
escape new and extremely dangerous perturbations.</p>

<h4>MY INTERVENTION</h4>

<p class="fst">Miliukoff's personal declarations were already being accepted in 
all revolutionary, democratic and socialist circles as evidence of the 
Provisional Government's duplicity.</p>

<p class="fst">Because of my position in the Revolution and in the Provisional 
Government I happened to be in closer touch with the people and felt more keenly 
the beating of the nation's pulse than the other members of the government.</p>

<p class="fst">I saw the helplessness of Gutchkoff, as minister of war and 
marine, in his efforts to stem the tide of anarchy and dissolution in the army 
and navy. I saw the complete helplessness of the Minister of the Interior, in 
his struggle to overcome the anarchy in the cities and villages without the 
support of the revolutionary social forces. I felt the decline of my own 
influence in the struggle against the Bolshevist demagogues because of the 
slippery, dualistic policy of the Soviet in making its confidence in the 
government conditional on this or that point of theoretical casuistry.</p>

<p class="fst">However valuable the principle of unity of the Provisional 
Government was, the government that was born in the first minutes of the 
Revolution, and much as it was important to keep all the original members of the 
cabinet in the government, because of their solemn oath to lead the country to 
the Constituent Assembly, and however desirable Miliukoff's presence in the 
Provisional Government was, his continuance as minister of foreign affairs was 
becoming a real national danger. On the other hand, it was no longer possible to 
tolerate a situation in which the leaders of the revolutionary democracy in the 
Soviet, who had the advantage of tremendous moral authority, did not share 
direct responsibility for the fate of the country.</p>

<p class="fst">It became necessary to force developments. On April twenty-fifth, 
late in the evening, I informed the press that the Provisional Government was 
preparing to consider the question of dispatching a note to the Allies, 
informing them of Russia's new war aims, as proclaimed by the Provisional 
Government on April ninth.</p>

<p class="fst">In some way my statement appeared in the press the next day in 
garbled form. Anticipating developments, the newspapers announced that the 
government was already discussing the note to the Allies.</p>

<p class="fst">Some of the members of the government had already decided to 
bring this question before the entire cabinet.<a href="#n1" name="fn1" target="_self">[1*]</a> 
However, no such discussion by the cabinet as a whole had yet taken place.</p>

<p class="fst">For this reason the Minister of Foreign Affairs was quite 
justified in demanding from the Provisional Government an official denial. On 
April twenty-seventh the newspapers reported: "The government has not discussed 
and is not preparing any note on the question of war aims."</p>

<p class="fst">This denial provoked a veritable storm. As was foreseen, 
Miliukoff was compelled to agree immediately to the dispatch of a note to the 
Allies on the question of war aims. But now this act assumed an exaggerated 
importance in the eyes of public opinion, being regarded as having been forced 
by the Soviet and, what was worse, by the Petrograd garrison.</p>

<h4>THE FIRST MOVE OF THE BOLSHEVIKI</h4>

<p class="fst">Because of the acute situation, the war aims note to the Allies 
was edited by the entire cabinet.<a href="#n2" name="fn2" target="_self">[2*]</a> 
We spent the whole night doing this in the office of Minister of War Gutchkoff, 
who was quite ill. The contents of the note should have satisfied the most 
violent critics of Miliukoff's "imperialism." However, what developed was a 
psychological break which cost us very dearly. The lack of confidence in and the 
hostility to Miliukoff in the Soviet and in the Democratic-Revolutionary circles 
in general was so great that these elements were no longer able to consider and 
to grasp the contents of the note. Revolutionary hysteria began.</p>

<p class="fst">At a special meeting the Executive Committee of the Petrograd 
Soviet adopted a resolution of sharp protest against the new "imperialist" 
declaration of the Provisional Government, and Lenin, who had just arrived from 
Switzerland, via Germany, hastened to dispatch his lieutenants to the barracks.</p>

<p class="fst">On May third the Finnish Guards Regiment appeared in the streets 
of Petrograd. Fully armed, with red banners and placards denouncing the 
Provisional Government, particularly Miliukoff and Gutchkoff, the troops marched 
to the Maryinsky Palace. All over the city appeared armed detachments of workmen 
and soldiers. The government was at that moment not in the Maryinsky Palace, 
which was surrounded by the armed mob, but on the Moika, at the office of 
Gutchkoff. Here appeared General Korniloff, commander of the Petrograd military 
district, with the request for the government's permission to call out troops 
for its protection.</p>

<p class="fst">Unanimously the government declined any such protection. We were 
all confident of the wisdom of our course and felt certain that the population 
would not permit any acts of violence against the government.</p>

<p class="fst">And, in truth, on the same day appeared an explanation by the 
Soviet of Workmen's and Soldiers' Deputies declaring that it had not summoned 
the troops to demonstrate against the government. Previous to this, immense 
throngs had appeared in the streets in a great demonstration in honor of the 
Provisional Government and, particularly, of Miliukoff.</p>

<p class="fst">This first mobilization of Bolshevist forces ended rather 
ludicrously for Lenin, but not without the sacrifice of a number of lives as a 
result of the shooting in the streets.<a href="#n3" name="fn3" target="_self">[3*]</a> 
The spilling of innocent blood had also a sobering effect on the leaders of the 
revolutionary democracy. The Soviet chieftains hastened to repudiate the 
Bolshevist adventure. On agreement between those leaders of the Soviet who were 
loyal to the government and the latter, the government made public, on May 
fourth, an explanation of the Foreign Minister's note of May first.</p>

<h4>THE SOVIET LEADERS ENTER THE GOVERNMENT</h4>

<p class="fst">As a matter of fact this explanation explained nothing, for there 
was nothing to explain. What it did was to emphasize points of importance from 
the point of view of popular psychology. The government pointed out that its 
note was sent by unanimous agreement of all the members of the government. In 
other words, the Soviets and army committees were informed that in this 
Miliukoff and Kerensky were in complete agreement. None of the ministers wished 
to repudiate solidarity with Miliukoff as a member of the Provisional 
Government, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had to be transferred, none the 
less, to some one else who would be able to conduct the nation's foreign policy 
by methods more elastic. Such was the opinion of the entire Provisional 
Government, with one or two exceptions. The question of readjustment of 
portfolios within the government was formally presented by me.</p>

<p class="fst">On April fourth I demanded from the government, on threat of 
leaving the cabinet, the transfer of Miliukoff to the Ministry of Education. At 
the same time the question was boldly raised of obtaining the immediate entrance 
into the government of Soviet leaders and leaders of the socialist parties. On 
May eighth the cabinet crisis became a fact. Rejecting the advice of the most 
prominent leaders of his own party (V. Nabokoff and M. Vinaver), P. N. Miliukoff 
refused to accept the portfolio of education and left the government. 
Simultaneously I sent a communication to the Temporary Committee of the Duma, 
the Soviet and the Central Committee of the Party of Social-Revolutionaries. In 
this communication I declared that henceforth the Provisional Government had to 
include not merely individual and casual representatives of the democracy, but 
men "chosen formally and directly by the organizations they represent." I also 
made my continued participation in the government contingent upon the agreement 
of all Left parties following the inclusion of their representatives in the 
ministry.</p>

<p class="fst">My communication was only the final, formal step in the 
development of the struggle for a coalition government. From the very beginning 
of April the government had unanimously decided to obtain, at all costs, the 
inclusion in the cabinet of representatives of the Soviet and of the socialist 
democracy. Prince Lvoff announced this categorically at his conference with the 
executive committee of the Soviet on May fourth.</p>

<p class="fst">It was not so easy, however, to bring this to realization. For 
not only were some of the liberals decidedly opposed to the participation in the 
"bourgeois" government of representatives of the so-called labor democracy, but 
this opposition was equally strong on the part of the orthodox Marxists in the 
Soviet. Shortly before the acute cabinet crisis, F. Dan, one of the most 
prominent leaders of the Mensheviki, had branded as "calumny" the very 
suggestion of the Soviet's agreement to participate in the reconstruction of the 
government.</p>

<p class="fst">"The supreme power is the Provisional Government," he had 
declared, "while the revolutionary democracy, represented by the Soviet, makes 
its influence on the progress of political life felt by means of uninterrupted 
organized pressure upon the government, and by control over it."</p>

<p class="fst">In fighting for a government coalition, so obviously essential to 
the interests of the country, those of us who never followed rigid party lines 
were thus compelled to break through the blockade of theoretical formula; and 
dead political blue prints piled up against us by the orthodox custodians of 
party doctrine, both in the socialist as well as in the bourgeois camp. Very 
soon the crisis grew more acute because of the departure from the government of 
War Minister Gutchkoff. I will speak of him and of the causes of his resignation 
later. At this point I will only say that with his departure the first cabinet 
of the Provisional Government concluded its existence. The romantic period of 
the Provisional Government came to an end.</p>

<p class="fst">On its departure, the first cabinet of the Provisional Government 
left behind for the nation a political testament which still continues to stir 
one's mind and heart. In drawing up the balance sheet of its short but extremely 
difficult and intensive work, the government addressed to the nation the 
following words of warning which were destined to become a terrible prophecy:</p>

<p class="indentb">The Provisional Government cannot conceal from the population 
the difficulties and obstacles it has found in its work. It cannot, also, 
refrain from mentioning the fact that these difficulties are increasing and are 
provoking serious alarm for the future.</p>

<p class="indentb">Called into life by a great popular movement, the Provisional 
Government regards itself as the agent and custodian of the people's will. As 
the basis of political administration it has chosen not violence or compulsion 
but the voluntary subordination of free citizens to the government they have 
themselves created. It seeks support not in physical but in moral forces.</p>

<p class="indentb">From the very beginning of its existence the Provisional 
Government has never violated these principles. It has not been responsible for 
the shedding of a single drop of the people's blood nor has it sought to erect 
barriers of force against any current of social thought.</p>

<p class="indentb">Unfortunately and to the great peril of liberty, the building 
of new social buttresses for strengthening the country is lagging far behind the 
process of dissolution called forth by the collapse of the old political order. 
Under these circumstances, with the refusal of the government to resort to the 
old, compulsory methods of administration and other artificial means of raising 
the prestige of authority, the difficulty of the task confronting the 
Provisional Government becomes insurmountable.</p>

<p class="indentb">The elemental urge of individual groups and elements of the 
population, as represented by the politically least intelligent and least 
organized of these elements, to achieve their desires and obtain satisfaction of 
their demands by methods of direct action and seizure, threatens to destroy 
internal unity and discipline, and to create fertile ground for acts of violence 
stimulating hostility to the new order, and for the cultivation of private 
interests and ambitions to the detriment of the general interest and of the 
fulfillment of civic duty.</p>

<p class="indentb">The Provisional Government considers it its duty to declare 
frankly and definitely that such a state of affairs makes administration of the 
country extremely difficult and threatens, in its consequence, to bring the 
country to internal dissolution and defeat at the front.</p>

<p class="indentb">There rises before Russia the terrible vision of civil war 
and anarchy which will destroy liberty. The dark and tragic road so well known 
to history, the one leading from liberty through civil conflict and anarchy to 
reaction and restoration of despotism, must not be that of the Russian people.</p>

<p class="fst">But Russia did not escape this Road of Crucifixion, for, amidst 
the horrors of war and the outbursts of civil conflict, the people did not have 
enough willpower, patience and discipline to stand fast on the brink of the 
precipice.</p>

<p class="fst">There was only one way of salvation&#8212;the union and cooperation of 
all the living, creative forces of the country, regardless of their political 
and social aspirations!</p>

<p class="fst">In May, 1917, we of the Provisional Government succeeded in 
laying the foundations of such union. After some resistance the Soviet, by a 
considerable majority (forty-one to nineteen), decided to accept the proposal of 
the Provisional Government for the participation of the Soviet in the government 
of the country. The old Soviet formula of conditional confidence, so destructive 
to the Provisional Government seeking to stand above party, was definitely 
abandoned.</p>

<p class="fst">Very soon the Soviet leaders and the leaders of the Left parties 
themselves, as members of the government, came under the blows of demagogic 
Bolshevist propaganda and of the impossible demands of the mobs run amuck. They 
then realized the entire scope of their responsibility towards the future of 
Russia. Only on the morning of May eighteenth, with the formation of the new 
coalition Provisional Government, did it become possible for the government, for 
the first time since the Revolution, to govern, to demand and to command.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n1" href="#fn1">[1*]</a> It was precisely in these difficult April days that the beginning was 
laid of that compact group within the Provisional Government which continued to 
exist up to the days of the Korniloff rebellion (in September) and which was 
termed the "Triumvirate" (Terestchenko-Nekrassoff-Kerensky). In April there were 
five of us, the others being Prince Lvoff and Konovaloff.&#8212;A. K.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n2" href="#fn2">[2*]</a> In these days was formed within the cabinet a special committee for 
preliminary consideration of all domestic and foreign questions relating to the 
conduct of the War. Those named on the committee were Prince Lvoff, Miliukoff, 
Terestchenko, Nekrassoff and myself.&#8212; A. K.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="n3" href="#fn3">[3*]</a> In the evening there was shooting beneath the windows of the Ministry of 
Justice, where I had as guests several members of the French socialist 
delegation, who had come to Russia to urge the Russian workers to continue the 
War to a victorious end. Particularly patriotic, frequently with tears in his 
eyes, was Marcel Cachin, who subsequently became leader of the French Communist 
party. While in my office he did not seem to relish the too close shots of the 
revolutionary proletariat.&#8212;A. K.</p>
