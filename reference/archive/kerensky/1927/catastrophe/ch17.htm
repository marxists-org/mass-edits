<h2><a name="h1">CHAPTER XVII</a><br>
<small>THE DRIVE AGAINST THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT</small></h2>

<p class="fst">ON August twenty-ninth the government returned to Petrograd, 
while Korniloff went back to General Headquarters. On September first the 
Germans launched a new attack on the Dvina, breaking through our lines and 
threatening Petrograd. On September third the Provisional Government made the 
following decisions:</p>

<p class="fst">1. To begin preparations for the government's removal to Moscow.</p>

<p class="fst">2. To transfer the troops of the Petrograd military district to 
the direct jurisdiction of the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p class="fst">3. To create a separate military area, consisting of Petrograd 
and its environs, under the jurisdiction of the Provisional Government.</p>

<p class="fst">4. To bring from the front a detachment of reliable troops, to be 
placed at the government's disposal.</p>

<p class="fst">This decision was made necessary by military and political 
considerations. Because of the unreliability and demoralization of the Petrograd 
garrison, it was necessary for the government to take proper measures 
guaranteeing its safe removal to Moscow, which was to take place at the end of 
November. In addition, the evidence at our disposal made it necessary for the 
government to be ready to repell any attack from the Right. It was only from 
that quarter that we faced any real danger at that time.</p>

<p class="fst">Immediately after the cabinet meeting at which the aforementioned 
decision was taken I dispatched Assistant War Minister Savinkoff and General 
Baranoffsky to General Headquarters, to cooperate in carrying out the 
government's decision. Before their departure I ordered Savinkoff to inform 
General Korniloff that, while he was at liberty to pick the troops to be sent to 
Petrograd, he was under no circumstances to delegate General Krimoff as 
commander of these troops. I also ordered Savinkoff to inform General Korniloff 
that the "Wild Division" was not to be included among these troops. My demands 
were motivated by the reliable information that General Krimoff and a number of 
the officers of the "Wild Division" had taken a direct part in the conspiracy. 
On September sixth General Korniloff categorically promised Savinkoff that my 
demands would be obeyed. This was reported to me by Savinkoff on September 
seventh. But on the same day General Korniloff, in a secret order, placed 
General Krimoff in command of the "Wild Division," which moved immediately in 
the direction of Petrograd.</p>

<p class="fst">In the order to his troops Krimoff declared that a Bolshevist 
revolution had broken out in Petrograd and that the government was unable to 
cope with it. On September ninth, when according to the calculations of General 
Headquarters Krimoff's troops were to have arrived near Petrograd, there 
appeared before me in the Winter Palace a former member of the Provisional 
Government, Vladimir Lvoff, who placed before me a verbal ultimatum from General 
Korniloff. The ultimatum did not surprise me, but I still entertained doubt as 
to whether General Korniloff had actually lent his name to it. The entire tragic 
significance of what was being contemplated appeared clearly before me. Only by 
quick action was it possible to save the situation. I immediately took myself in 
hand and pretended that I did not believe in the authenticity of the ultimatum. 
Lvoff became greatly excited, assuring me on his word of honor that all he said 
was true. I then demanded that he put the ultimatum in writing. I told him this 
was necessary as otherwise the Provisional Government to whom I, as premier and 
war minister, was to carry Korniloff's ultimatum demanding the government's 
resignation would consider me mad. Lvoff wrote down the ultimatum point by 
point:</p>

<p class="fst">1. Proclamation of martial law in Petrograd.</p>

<p class="fst">2. Immediate resignation of the government.</p>

<p class="fst">3. My departure the same night, together with Savinkoff, for 
General Headquarters, where we were to put ourselves at Korniloff's disposal.</p>

<p class="fst">I put the written ultimatum into my side pocket and agreed with 
Lvoff to meet him at seven o'clock in the evening at the long distance telephone 
at the War Ministry, when we were to converse with General Korniloff at General 
Headquarters. En route to the War Ministry I still entertained some hope that 
the ultimatum and my whole conversation with Lvoff were a horrible dream. Lvoff 
was late for the appointment. There was no time to lose. I called Korniloff at 
General Headquarters and in my name and Lvoff's, who had not yet arrived, I 
began to question Korniloff on all the points of the ultimatum, with the 
ostensible purpose of verifying the general's demands. I wanted to make 
absolutely sure that the ultimatum was in his name. I asked leading questions, 
which could be answered only by a person thoroughly familiar with the contents 
of the ultimatum. General Korniloff's replies showed he was well versed in the 
matter and had given it his full approval. Especially convincing was his final 
reply.</p>

<p class="fst">Without mentioning Savinkoff, whose name appeared in the 
ultimatum, I asked:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Am I to come to General Headquarters?"</p>

<p class="fst">General Korniloff replied:</p>

<p class="quoteb">"Yes, and with Savinkoff."</p>

<p class="fst">There could no longer be any doubt. It was necessary to act with 
utmost rapidity. On my leaving the telephone I was met by Lvoff. We returned 
together to the Winter Palace. There, in my office, I repeated to him my 
conversation with General Korniloff. Lvoff again confirmed and explained 
everything. In a dark, far corner of the large office, unnoticed by Lvoff, sat 
an official of the Ministry of the Interior. He heard our conversation and noted 
Lvoff's statement. On completing my conversation with Lvoff I walked out into 
the corridor, summoned the officer on guard and ordered him to arrest Vladimir 
Lvoff, former member of the Provisional Government.</p>

<p class="fst">In an hour I submitted a report to the Provisional Government 
together with the incriminating ultimatum and received from the cabinet 
extraordinary powers for the liquidation of the Korniloff mutiny, which was 
about to begin with the arrival, expected at any moment, of Krimoff's troops in 
Petrograd.</p>

<p class="fst">I will not go into further details. As I foretold, the rebellious 
general found himself suddenly without troops and railways, and cut off at 
General Headquarters from the entire country. Without firing a single shot we 
were victorious, for the rank and file of even the "Wild Division" refused to 
follow their officers when emissaries dispatched by me to head off and arrest 
Krimoff informed the troops of the use to which they were being put. Krimoff 
himself was brought a prisoner to my office. While under arrest in my office, 
General Krimoff committed suicide by shooting himself with his revolver.</p>

<p class="fst">On September twelfth the adventure was finished. On September 
thirteenth I issued an order to the army and navy presenting a picture of the 
anarchy and demoralization provoked anew by the Korniloff adventure.</p>

<p class="fst">Following the arrest of Korniloff and his immediate associates, 
the supporters of the Korniloff movement launched a widespread campaign through 
the press against the Provisional Government. Amply supplied with funds they 
successfully spread the falsehood that there had been no conspiracy, that 
Korniloff was the victim of a "misunderstanding" between himself and the 
Provisional Government. It was even asserted that I had been in "agreement" with 
Korniloff through Savinkoff and "betrayed" him under pressure from the Soviet. 
This slanderous invention was immediately taken up by the Bolsheviki, who used 
it as dynamite with which, within a few days, they succeeded in destroying the 
confidence of the rank and file of the army in the Provisional Government.</p>

<p class="fst">The Korniloff uprising destroyed the entire work of the 
restoration of discipline in the army, achieved after almost superhuman efforts.</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin, still in hiding, immediately grasped the significance of 
the service performed for him by the organizers of the Korniloff rebellion.</p>

<p class="fst">"General Korniloff," wrote Lenin to the Central Executive 
Committee of the Bolshevist party from Finland, whither he had fled after the 
issuance of my July order for his arrest, "has opened for us quite unexpected 
perspectives. We must act at once."</p>

<p class="fst">The movements of the Bolsheviki were facilitated by the crisis 
provoked by the Korniloff rebellion in the parties comprising the government 
coalition. The sympathy which had been extended to Korniloff by many prominent 
liberals roused among the socialist parties a strong movement against 
continuance of cooperation with the bourgeois parties. The Provisional 
Government could no longer be maintained in the composition upon which it was 
based on the day of the Korniloff mutiny. A directorate was set up, in whose 
name I had to conduct prolonged negotiations with the respective parties for 
restoration of the government coalition. All these conversations proved endless 
because virtually no one believed in the possibility of restoring mutual 
confidence among the parties.</p>

<p class="fst">In the meantime the new wave of anarchy and disintegration rose 
high under the stimulus of Bolshevist propaganda and demagogy. The Korniloff 
rebellion was crushed on September twelfth. On September eighteenth, for the 
first time since the Revolution, the presidium of the Petrograd Soviet was 
captured by the Bolsheviki. Having formed from among the soldiers' section of 
the Soviet a military-revolutionary committee, Trotsky began to prepare the 
garrison for another uprising against the Provisional Government.</p>

<p class="fst">As in the beginning of March, heaps of telegrams came to my desk, 
telling of local uprisings and mutinies, agrarian disturbances, attacks by 
soldiers against officers, etc. But then, in the spring, all hopes were before 
us. Now, in the autumn, all the fires of hope were dying. The revived anarchy 
inside the country combined soon with a new wave of mass desertions from the 
front.</p>

<p class="fst">This tragedy came to pass exactly at the time when all our 
sacrifices were about to find their justification. The Austro-Hungarian 
government, having realized that the situation of Austria-Hungary was untenable, 
addressed to the Provisional Government a request for a separate peace. The move 
was made without knowledge of Berlin. It was particularly significant because 
Foreign Minister Terestchenko had long been preparing, with the cooperation of 
the diplomatic representatives of the United States in Bulgaria and Turkey, a 
plan for negotiations which would have meant the exit of Bulgaria and Turkey 
from the War. There could be no doubt, with Austria's example before them, that 
similar peace proposals would have followed soon from Sofia and Constantinople. 
The exit to the Mediterranean would have been opened for Russia. The blockade of 
Russia would have been broken and Germany would have stood completely isolated 
in Europe. Russia was on the verge of her greatest victory.</p>

<p class="fst">Instead of victory we received Brest-Litovsk. The news of 
Austria's separate peace proposal reached Petrograd on November fifth. On 
November seventh, suddenly and unexpectedly&#8212;unexpectedly for us, but not for 
Berlin&#8212;came the Bolshevist counter-revolution. The Bolshevist General Staff had 
originally planned the uprising for the day of the contemplated transfer of the 
Provisional Government to Moscow, which was not to have taken place before the 
middle of November.</p>
