The Ten-Point Program

<ol class="numbered">
<li>We Want Freedom. We Want Power To Determine<br> 
    The Destiny Of Our Black Community.

    <p class="fst">We believe that Black people will not be free 
until we are able to determine our destiny.</p>

<li>We Want Full Employment For Our People.

    <p class="fst">We believe that the federal government is 
responsible and obligated to give every man 
employment or a guaranteed income. We believe that 
if the White American businessmen will not give 
full employment, then the <a href="../../../../../../glossary/terms/m/e.htm#means-production">means of production</a> 
should be taken from the businessmen and placed in 
the community so that the people of the community 
can organize and employ all of its people and give 
a high standard of living.</p>

<li>We Want An End To The Robbery <br> By The
    Capitalists Of Our Black Community.

    <p class="fst">We believe that this racist government has 
robbed us, and now we are demanding the overdue 
debt of forty acres and two mules. Forty acres and 
two mules were promised 100 years ago as 
restitution for slave labor and mass murder of 
Black people. We will accept the payment in 
currency which will be distributed to our many 
communities. The Germans are now aiding the Jews 
in Israel for the genocide of the Jewish people. 
The Germans murdered six million Jews. The 
American racist has taken part in the slaughter of 
over fifty million Black people; therefore, we 
feel that this is a modest demand that we make.</p>

<li>We Want Decent Housing Fit For The Shelter Of
    Human Beings.

    <p class="fst">We believe that if the White Landlords will 
not give decent housing to our Black community, 
then the housing and the land should be made into 
cooperatives so that our community, with 
government aid, can build and make decent housing 
for its people.</p>

<li>We Want Education For Our People That Exposes<br> 
The True Nature Of This Decadent American Society.<br>  
We Want Education That Teaches Us Our True History <br> 
And Our Role In The Present-Day Society.

    <p class="fst">We believe in an educational system that will 
give to our people a knowledge of self. If a man 
does not have knowledge of himself and his 
position in society and the world, then he has 
little chance to relate to anything else.</p>

<li>We Want All Black Men To Be Exempt From
    Military Service.

    <p class="fst">We believe that Black people should not be 
forced to fight in the military service to defend 
a racist government that does not protect us. We 
will not fight and kill other people of color in 
the world who, like Black people, are being 
victimized by the White racist government of 
America. We will protect ourselves from the force 
and violence of the racist police and the racist 
military, by whatever means necessary.</p>

<li>We Want An Immediate End To <br> Police Brutality
    And Murder Of Black People.

    <p class="fst">We believe we can end police brutality in our 
Black community by organizing Black self-defense 
groups that are dedicated to defending our Black 
community from racist police oppression and 
brutality. The Second Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States gives a right to 
bear arms. We therefore believe that all Black 
people should arm themselves for self- defense.</p>

<li>We Want Freedom For All Black Men <br> Held In
    Federal, State, County And City Prisons And
    Jails.

    <p class="fst">We believe that all Black people should be 
released from the many jails and prisons because 
they have not received a fair and impartial trial.</p>

<li>We Want All Black People When Brought To Trial
    To Be Tried In <br> Court By A Jury Of Their Peer
    Group Or People From Their Black<br>  Communities,
    As Defined By The Constitution Of The United
    States.

    <p class="fst">We believe that the courts should follow the 
United States Constitution so that Black people 
will receive fair trials. The Fourteenth Amendment of 
the U.S. Constitution gives a man a right to be 
tried by his peer group. A peer is a person from a 
similar economic, social, religious, geographical, 
environmental, historical and racial background. 
To do this the court will be forced to select a 
jury from the Black community from which the Black 
defendant came. We have been, and are being, tried 
by all-White juries that have no understanding of 
the "average reasoning man" of the Black 
community.</p>

<li>We Want Land, Bread, Housing, Education,<br> 
    Clothing, Justice And Peace.

<p class="fst">When, in the course of human events, it becomes 
necessary for one people to dissolve the political 
bands which have connected them with another, and 
to assume, among the powers of the earth, the 
separate and equal station to which the laws of 
nature and nature's God entitle them, a decent 
respect of the opinions of mankind requires that 
they should declare the causes which impel them to 
the separation.
</p>

</ol>


<p class="fst">We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all 
men are created equal; that they are endowed by 
their Creator with certain inalienable rights; 
that among these are life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness. That, to secure these 
rights, governments are instituted among men, 
deriving their just powers from the consent of the 
governed; that, whenever any form of government 
becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right 
of the people to alter or abolish it, and to 
institute a new government, laying its foundation 
on such principles, and organizing its powers in 
such form, as to them shall seem most likely to 
effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, 
indeed, will dictate that governments long 
established should not be changed for light and 
transient causes; and, accordingly, all experience 
hath shown that mankind are more disposed to 
suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right 
themselves by abolishing the forms to which they 
are accustomed. But, when a long train of abuses 
and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same 
object, evinces a design to reduce them under 
absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their 
duty, to throw off such government, and to provide 
new guards for their future security.
