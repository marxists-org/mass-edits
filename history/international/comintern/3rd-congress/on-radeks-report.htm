<h4>Discussion on the Report by Comrade Radek. Speakers Comrades 
Hempel, Terrachini, Lenin, Micalek, Vaughan</h4>

<p class="fst"><strong>Comrade Hempel <span class="inote">[for the KAPD]</span>:</strong> Comrades! After hearing the Report by Comrade Radek concerning 
the tactical line to be adopted by the Communist International, it is possible 
for us to declare our agreement with the first formulation put forward by 
Comrade Radek, to the extent that these correspond with the conviction that we 
ourselves hold as a result of our observations upon the world economic 
situation, namely - that we consider the approaching collapse of the capitalist 
mode of production to be confirmed, and that the proletarian revolution will be 
its unconditional and necessary outcome. However, when we come to consider the 
question of how this proletarian revolution should be carried through, how the 
line of battle of the revolutionary proletariat should be disposed in the course 
of the struggle - the differences do indeed exist. Since only a short time for 
speaking has been allotted to me, I will attempt to clarify these differences as 
concisely as possible.</p>

<p class="fst">Let us consider the period from 1917, the revolution in Russia. 
Similarly let us consider the revolutions in Germany and Austria; when we 
consider all the revolutions which have occurred in this epoch, we observe one 
salient fact: that the form of organisation adopted by the fighting proletariat 
has been that of Soviets. In Germany we call them Räte <span class="inote">[Councils]</span>. This was the 
line of battle adopted by the proletariat, this was the organisational form of 
the working masses. We can establish this point further through the example of 
other revolutionary struggles on a smaller scale, such as the factory occupation 
which occurred in Italy. The proletariat has its Councils, or at least their 
organisational form; it has made use in the past of factory committees, and is 
now forming these in England within the arena of the widespread miners' strike 
there <span class="inote">[this is the truly revolutionary leadership given by the shop stewards]</span>. 
The German proletariat after 1918 has adopted in all its revolutionary 
struggles, from the smallest to the largest, the organisational form based upon 
councils of workers in factories and other places of work. This is what we 
should perceive in the revolution. It is this that we should be turning over in 
our minds and trying to evaluate. Having done this, we should openly declare: if 
this is the line of formation adopted by the proletariat in the revolution, then 
it behoves us, as Communists who wish to win a position of leadership in the 
revolution, and who indeed must win it, to approach the question of the 
organisation of revolutionary organisation of the proletariat in accordance with 
the same method.</p>

<p class="fst">This is what we of the Communist Workers' Party declares - and 
this is not as Comrade Radek believes, the brainchild of Comrade Gorter in 
Holland or a figment of his imagination. On the contrary, it is the product of 
our experience in all the struggles through which we have fought since 1918. We 
workers are not great theoreticians, but we have above all the experience we 
have gained from our struggles to guide us. We have reached a point at which we 
must give the revolutionary workers; those who really wish to play a part in the 
struggle, a foothold, helping them to break free from the old organisational 
forms of the working class movement and offering them a helping hand towards 
those new organisational forms of the working class movement and offering them a 
helping hand towards these new organisational forms through which the revolution 
may be brought to a victorious conclusion.</p>

<p class="fst">This is thrown into clearest relief when it is brought to mind 
just what the tasks of the old workers' movement were - or, expressed in clearer 
terms, what were the aims of the workers' movement in the epoch prior to the 
actual outbreak of the revolution. Its tasks were: on the one hand, through the 
agency of the political organisations of the working class, the political 
parties, to dispatch delegates to the parliaments and other representative 
institutions of capitalism which were publicly accepted by the bourgeoisie and 
the bureaucracy as being a respectable form of representation for the working 
class. This was the one task, and it was exploited to the full. In the then 
prevailing conditions, this was correct. The economic organisations of the 
working class then had the task of winning improvements in the situation of the 
workers under capitalism, of inspiring the workers to struggle, and, when 
struggle was no longer possible, of negotiating. I must express myself as 
briefly as possible. That was the character of the tasks confronting the 
workers' organisations before the War.</p>

<p class="fst">When, however, the revolution broke out, other tasks made their 
appearance. Now the workers' organisations could no longer confine themselves to 
demands for higher wages nor restrict their main aims to those of mere 
representation in parliament, in order to squeeze out a few more concessions for 
the workers. That is reformism. Now our critics confront us with the statement: 
but we don't want that either! - and we reply: yes! - we believe you when you 
say this is not what you want; but if you adopt the same course as that of the 
old workers' movement, then you will be drawn willy-nilly onto that road, you 
will be powerless to do otherwise, and any number of theses will be of no avail 
in preventing it.</p>

<p class="fst">Our whole experience proves this. It was not for nothing that the 
old workers' movement had its own characteristic organisations. For what does 
one need in order to be represented in parliament ? For this one has no need of 
revolutionary fighters, one needs only to be enlightened concerning the real 
conditions of the existing state, one needs personalities, skilled in debate, as 
experienced parliamentarians are, and from them one receives reports, etc. No 
more than that. What does one need in the arena of the economic struggle ? One 
needs no more than combinations of workers, trade unions, headed by diligent 
officials capable of negotiating with employers and their firms. Leaders remain 
faithful to such organisations, they stand by them. Money is collected in order 
to carry through a possible future strike. Solidarity organisations are set up, 
which is in essence what the trade unions are, instruments serving the working 
class for quite definite purposes, to serve a quite definite aim: namely, to 
enable the workers to find as comfortable a way of life as possible within the 
capitalist order.</p>

<p class="fst">And if it then happens that Communists come to believe that these 
instruments - which are incapable of encompassing revolutionary struggle, which 
are unviable weapons in the heat of revolutionary battles - if they seek to make 
this use this form of leadership, of these organisations, and come to believe 
that they will be able by this means to lead the revolution through to victory, 
then they commit a serious error, and in this way they will eventually find 
themselves being tramples underfoot. Are we not undergoing this experience over 
and over again, the experience which teaches that all workers' organisations of 
this kind, which have chosen this path, when it comes to the decisive struggle, 
end in collapse ?</p>

<p class="fst">This is the great lesson we must draw from these experiences. In 
this connection we say: it is the end aim which they must keep firmly in mind, 
and that aim is: to shatter and destroy capitalist power, to destroy the power 
of the state. Specifically to serve and achieve this objective, the proletariat 
must create its own organisations. It is the proletariat itself which brings 
these organisations into being. We see an example of this when, in a particular 
industrial establishment, for instance in Germany, the workers submit their 
demands - and these demands, given present-day conditions, turn out to be such 
that the employers are unable grant them.</p>

<p class="fst">So what do the workers do then ? They elect their own 
representatives, whom they know and trust from their own factories, from their 
own places of work. They find that the struggle which they wage, already at this 
early stage, has to be one conducted against the wishes of the trades union 
leaderships. This has been our experience throughout the long history of these 
small struggles, these small strikes, right through up to the large scale 
struggles of the present.</p>

<p class="fst">We see then: the proletariat is already being compelled, even 
today, to organise itself for revolutionary struggle, for control of the 
economy, and we say: we Communists must recognise this, must acknowledge that 
the path taken by the old workers' movement was a false one. We have found a new 
path, the path of revolutionary struggle, and for that reason we declare that 
the workers must organise themselves in accordance with the selfsame example 
which the revolution itself, in the course of its development has shown us, and 
in which, when struggle is placed on the agenda, we Communists should play the 
leading role. For all these reasons we say: the Communists must encourage and 
lead the proletariat to organise itself on the basis of the factories and places 
of work, to organise with quite a definite aim in view, for quite a definite 
purpose, namely: to conquer power over production, the productive forces, the 
factories, and to take control over them into its own hands. It arises out of 
the very conditions under which which these struggles are waged that the 
proletariat must organise itself in this way, for it is in pursuit of these very 
aims that the proletariat wages its struggles in the first place.</p>

<p class="fst">Comrades, it is not possible for me to dwell at any greater 
length on these matters. It is the task of Communists to recognise them and to 
make such problems as these their closest concern.</p>

<p class="fst">And so we come now to the next point. The line of formation to be 
adopted by the proletariat, its organisation in struggle and the tasks facing it 
in that struggle - these also show us the methods which should be adopted in 
that struggle. The methods must be revolutionary in character, and in the 
contemporary age they arise out of our analysis of the economic situation, as 
also out of our evaluation of the situation within the camp of the class enemy.</p>

<p class="fst">The class enemy is today in course of adopting counter-measures. 
He has, of course, done this before, but today his preparations are being 
pursued to an intensified degree. Above all, they are such as are designed 
specifically to maintain the class enemy's grip upon social power. On the one 
hand upon state power, on the other hand to bring about a situation in which 
industry and the economy can once again bring them some returns. What is not 
possible for them is to set the whole economy once again into motion. This they 
cannot do. It is, however, possible for them to consolidate a part of it, its 
decisive inner kernel, and this they seek to achieve the expense of other parts. 
This is what is taking place now in all countries of the world. We Communists 
must observe this, and we must see what further consequences might arise out of 
this new start adopted by the capitalists who, as always, are acting with 
methodical resolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The first result of these new policies is that a section of the 
proletariat is maintained in a reasonable condition of life in those industrial 
establishments in which capitalist production is still viable, in the still 
viable sectors of the economy. And we can see that this strongest kernel of 
capitalism, these trusts and super-trusts, combine in joint relations with one 
another in all countries and so maintain a dominant position. But if only a part 
of the proletariat is able to find employment and the means of life in these 
most concentrated establishments, it follows that another section must be 
deprived of those blessings. And that deprived section constitutes by far the 
preponderant mass of the unemployed, who can find no support in the present-day 
system and who are condemned gradually to perish. This is the dichotomisation of 
the working class, the economic division within it. The worker who still has his 
place in the factory, who still possesses the means for continuing his struggle 
through life - he hangs on desperately to his employment, he does everything he 
can not to lose it. And the workers who have already been thrown out of the 
factory appear as the enemy of those who are still afforded the means of life. 
This is the division which capital is purposefully promoting and which is being 
stirred up by the bourgeois press on every occasion. This is the way in which 
capitalism is being restored to good health. We do not say that this is a 
permanent restoration of the rule of capital, but a restoration for a certain 
period of time, a restoration which rests upon the emaciated corpses of the 
proletariat. We must recognise this, and it is from this situation that we are 
also able to derive our battle tactics, as also the method which we must employ 
in order to advance to a new situation.</p>

<p class="fst">It is the task of us Communists to alert the proletariat so as to 
ensure that this tactic of consolidating only the one section of the economy and 
its workers cannot be brought to completion. For that would represent nothing 
less than the defeat of the entire proletarian movement. It is our task to take 
up the struggle at every stage, to take advantage of even the smallest 
opportunity. It is our task to prevent by all possible means - and here I am at 
one with Comrade Radek - that this favoured section of the economy, as it is 
being planned and promoted by the capitalists, should be successfully 
reconstructed.</p>

<p class="fst">To achieve this, we have on our side the enormous and continually 
growing masses of the unemployed, the starving proletarians, and it is our task 
to unite them. Our aim in uniting them is not that they should elect us to 
parliament, so that they can vote for our resolutions; on the contrary, our aim 
must be to grip them at the level of their basic life-conditions; we must 
encourage them to organise themselves in Councils, and we must bring them into 
touch with other Councils, with the shop stewards from the factories and works. 
It is by this means that we shall bring into being the organisation of the 
proletariat; it is by this means that we will achieve the unity of the 
proletariat in action. Above all, it will be necessary for us to engage 
continuously in struggle. The speeches, the resolutions and the Open Letter, 
such as Comrade Radek has proposed here - they cannot in any way constitute the 
platform upon which the unification of the revolutionary proletariat will be 
achieved. That platform can be forged only out of unremitting struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">Comrade Radek spoke of an offensive and defensive phase. Even at 
the beginning of this year, we in Germany recognised the turn events were taking 
with us. We have seen how bourgeois democracy has been kept alive by resort to 
measures of every conceivable kind - implemented through the Social Democrats, 
the Independents, all the parliamentary parties and organisations, and finally 
by measures adopted by the entire bourgeoisie. It was an insidious situation, 
which was just what capital needed; it was absolutely necessary to break it. We 
issued the following slogans: make the maximum use of each and every dispute in 
all factories: push those disputes relentlessly forward, extend them, make use 
of every opportunity to offer the clenched fist to each and every capitalist; 
cultivate communication from factory to factory, and everywhere work to sharpen 
the struggle. Comrades we have seen that as a result of these aims the situation 
in central Germany intensified, and it became the March Action. Then there came 
the offensives led by Hörsing and the storm in Germany had broken out. We say 
that this was an offensive, at least as we understand that word, and that this 
must be promoted to the maximum.</p>

<p class="fst">However all of a sudden, to command the launching of an 
offensive, quite unannounced - that is sheer nonsense!</p>

<p class="fst">And now I would like to refer once again to the attitude which we 
adopted on 20th August of that year, when Red troops stood on the East Prussian 
border, before Warsaw. It is necessary that our judgement of what constitutes an 
offensive or a defensive situation be brought to bear on these events also. We 
of the KAPD sought to prepare the ground by all possible means throughout the 
country, through weeks of preliminary actions, in public meetings, by means of 
leaflets, through propaganda in the factories, through making the maximum 
possible use of the mood brought into being through the fact that the Red troops 
were at the border, and so on.</p>

<p class="fst">And when the news finally broke that troops and supplies from 
France were rolling through Germany - what was to be done ? We for our part, 
quite consciously took the decision to push matters to the point of 
insurrection. We carried out these preparations in a planned way in all areas. 
And then on the 20th of August and on the previous evening - it is only today 
that we are able for the first time to speak our mind on these matters, because 
up till now many of our Comrades found themselves in prison because of these 
things - there appeared in the Rote Fahne, and in Freiheit and in all the 
provincial papers in Germany, the summons: 'To the Proletarians of Germany: take 
heed of this Warning! Spies and provocateurs, unsavoury elements, are seeking to 
lure you into a bloodbath! ' and so forth. We now confess openly, if ever we 
have committed a serious error, then it was on this day, and namely that we 
strove with all the means at our disposal to put the brakes upon the Action - 
the Action which it had been intended should break out in the strategically most 
important parts of Germany. In many places we had even succeeded, and now it is 
even the subject of scornful remarks uttered at our expense that our Comrades in 
Velbert and Köthen had gone so far as to proclaim the Soviet Republic!</p>

<p class="fst">We say: one may pour scorn on us for this - that does not trouble 
us. But the duty of a Communist in this situation was to seize the offensive at 
this precise moment. In Germany we consider such an action to be an offensive, 
but considered on an international scale it was not so much an offensive as 
simply an act of solidarity with the struggles of our Russian brothers, who were 
being threatened by the supply of war materials. These things also must be taken 
into account before any judgement concerning what constitutes offensive and 
defensive action is reached.</p>

<p class="fst">So now we come to the question of partial demands. I have already 
broached this subject, that of the Open Letter - over there, there is control of 
production, couldn't that be called a 'partial demand' ? But then Comrade Radek 
has spelled out for us so very clearly what partial demands may or may not look 
like. In Germany this Open Letter, supported by the trades unions, supported by 
the parliamentary parties - it must have an opportunist outcome! An Open Letter 
which has as its foundation the support of revolutionary organisations engaged 
in economic struggle - such an Open Letter surely possesses the very qualities 
which Comrade Radek has found lacking in the Vereinigte kommunistische Partei 
Deutschlands <span class="inote">[United communist Party of Germany - VKPD]</span>. Where are the meetings 
of the Action Committees which should have laid down the basis for the struggle, 
the meetings which should have taken place as a result of the Open Letter ?</p>

<p class="fst">Yes of course we rejected it, because we know our Pappenheimers 
only too well, because we knew that that course could bring us nothing more than 
negotiations with the government, because it consisted of nothing but empty 
phrases. It was for this reason that we rejected it. We are in agreement with 
every measure to intensify the struggle. But one should also consider carefully 
what is being done. One cannot simply produce solutions in the way a conjuror 
produces cards out of his shirt sleeves, they constitute preparations for 
revolution which must be put in hand. The solutions would have been to hand if 
we had possessed revolutionary organisations, they would have been taken if, for 
the past two years the Central Committee of the Spartacist League, indeed the 
Third International itself, had not been insisting: 'no factory organisations, 
no general workers unions'; and instead, 'do what you can with the old trade 
unions'. One should pay attention to how things really are; and, above all, one 
should ask the class fighters themselves, those who wage continuous struggle; 
they will tell you how matters stand. They will show you how, and how alone, 
struggle should be waged. As you know, I do not have the time to analyse 
everything in detail.</p>

<p class="fst">So this is how we have to deal with the question of partial 
actions. We declare openly: we do not reject any partial actions. What we do say 
is that each and every action, each and every struggle, must be thoroughly 
worked out, must be pursued through to the end. One cannot say that we reject 
this particular action or that particular struggle. Any struggle which arises 
out of the economic life-needs of the workers must be pursued by all possible 
means. And precisely in such a land as Germany, or indeed in England, or any of 
the 'democratic' countries which have experienced 40 or 50 years of bourgeois 
democracy and its effects, this is absolutely imperative. In all those countries 
the workers must first become accustomed to struggle. The slogans issued must 
correspond to such partial actions. Let us take an example: in a factory or in a 
number of factories, a so-called general strike breaks out, which spreads over a 
small area. In such a situation the slogan 'Struggle for the Dictatorship of the 
Proletariat', can have no relevance. That would be nonsense. Slogans must 
correspond to the conditions prevailing, they must correspond to the concrete 
possibilities in that area. Also, the slogans must be suited to the character of 
the struggle which the particular movement is pursuing. Let us assume that a 
general uprising is taking place in the country; it is tactically obvious that 
the slogans issued should not simply declare: 'Now it's a matter of life or 
death!'</p>

<p class="fst">So now I will make some comments on the March Action, in order 
thereby to illustrate what effect the lessons deriving from it have had; lessons 
which have not yet been demonstrated here. In and for itself, the March Action - 
everyone now holds this view - was not in any way an action which could have led 
to the overthrow of the power of capital. We also saw this. But in spite of this 
it was necessary to declare the slogan: 'Overthrow the government!' It was 
necessary to issue this slogan, because otherwise there would have been no 
further prospect of any real struggle being waged on the part of the 
proletarians in Germany. But, over and above this, it was also necessary to 
issue this slogan because, seen as whole, there remained in Germany no other 
course for proletarians to take. The present social order means death by 
starvation for so-and-so many millions of proletarians, means a slow death for 
ever larger sections of the population. As a consequence, there remained for 
those workers who are living in conditions of dire distress but one aim: the 
forcible overthrow of the present order of society! This, had to be the slogan 
in Central Germany. It had to be formulated in that way because for the first 
time it was necessary to show the German proletariat how it could lift itself 
out of its condition of distress.</p>

<p class="fst">I would like to choose an example. It was January 1918 in 
Germany. The war with all its consequences weighed heavily upon the proletariat. 
In January 1918 the munitions workers and the dock workers managed to find the 
way, using every resolve, to rise up in revolt against the tyranny of the war, 
against hunger, poverty and distress. They did this using the weapon of a series 
of general strikes. And what happened ?</p>

<p class="fst">The other workers, the proletarians in soldiers uniform, did not 
yet understand their brother workers were on strike. A few perhaps. The ice had 
not yet been broken. But what progress did this struggle make throughout the 
country ? How was the persecution of the workers instigated ?</p>

<p class="fst">Even as they were being pursued into every corner and hiding 
place, the news of the strike, of this movement of the workers was reaching into 
every corner of Germany! Everyone, every single person, knew of the events which 
marked the struggle. And so, as conditions reached the point at which nothing 
more could be saved of the military economy and of the so-called German Reich, 
then at last the workers and soldiers found the means enabling them to carry 
through the actions which their predecessors in struggle, those of January 1918, 
had taught them.</p>

<p class="fst">And now matters find themselves at a similar pass in Germany. 
Thanks to the March struggle of 1921, the proletariat of Germany has had an 
example held before it of the sole means by which it alone can find a way out of 
the collapse, and everyone now knows this in Germany. We possess insufficient 
means, inadequate instruments of propaganda, to take that lesson into every 
street and every household. That we must leave in large part to the bourgeoisie, 
the bourgeois citizenry, and they do this in a manner different from ours. They 
persecute us, they denounce us as criminals, wretched curs, they hunt us down. 
And still, even today, the proletariat joins hands in denouncing us, still adds 
its voice to the denunciations. But when general social conditions deteriorate 
still further, the proletariat will prepare to make its way along the same road 
of struggle we have take, and it will recognise that road. In this way the 
revolution battles its way through. For all these reasons the slogan had to be 
declared and the struggle had to be unleashed for the overthrow of capitalist 
power, the existing order. That is the great lesson for the International which 
this March Action has given us. This is greater than all the trivialities to we 
are still clinging here.</p>

<p class="fst">Comrades, it still remains for me to outline in brief words the 
precise form the organisation of the fighting proletariat should assume. Up till 
now I have merely hinted vaguely at such matters. The proletariat should no 
longer organise itself in such a way as merely to permit itself to be 
represented in the capitalist state in the spheres of politics and economics, in 
order thereby to make use of bourgeois democracy. On the contrary, the 
proletariat should organise itself for revolution. Such experience of revolution 
as the Russian Revolution, the German and Austrian Revolutions have given us, 
including the experience of separate struggles, this is what the proletariat 
should adopt as its guideline, this is how it should organise itself. For this 
reason we say: the Communists must now form themselves into a hard core, must 
now form a framework which the proletariat can adopt as its own, when the very 
development itself impels it into struggle. And this framework, of what does it 
consist ?</p>

<p class="fst">It is formed out of the factory organisations, which join 
together on the basis of industries, industrial sectors and provinces. Today 
there are only a few. <span class="inote">[A shout from the floor: 'They are becoming even fewer!']</span> 
Today it is they who are holding the standard high, who are maintaining the 
organisational framework. But when the struggles flare up once again, it they 
who will play an ever larger and more significant part. For the proletariat will 
then be compelled to hold fast to this framework, because the trades unions will 
no longer provide a structure adequate to the promote those struggles. That is 
what we must now recognise. That is how the tactics of the Third International 
should be formulated, then we will begin to advance.</p>

<p class="fst">In order to maintain these organisations, to lead them, in order 
to be able continuously, to educate this entire class formation, the proletariat 
needs a Communist Party, but it does not need that kind of a Communist Party 
which is not able to play a leading role through all its separate organs, and 
which can only function by means of directives issued by a centre. What the 
proletariat needs is a highly trained party with a core of steel. This is how it 
should be. Each individual Communist should be a fully developed Communist, that 
is our aim, and he should be able to fulfil a leading role in whatever position 
he finds himself in. He should be able to stand up against all attacks in all 
conditions, in whatever struggles he is involved, and that which gives him 
backbone, that which holds him upright, is his Programme. On the other hand, 
that which compels him to commence negotiations, that can only be the decisions 
which his Comrades have reached. Here the strongest discipline must prevail. 
Here there will be no forgiving. On the contrary, here there will be expulsions 
or other punitive measures whenever or wherever necessary. This will be a Party, 
in short, which is the steel core, which knows what it has to do, which stands 
firm, which is tested in struggle, which no longer negotiates, but which carries 
on the struggle continuously. And such a Party can only come into being when it 
really throws itself into the struggle, when it breaks with all the old remnants 
of the trade union and party movement, with its reformist methods - the trades 
union movement is a part of this - and when it completely renounces 
parliamentarism. From all this the Communists must break away, by this means 
they burn behind them the very bridges which lead back to negotiations with the 
bourgeoisie; and not only by these means is a return to an accommodation with 
the bourgeoisie set in motion, but also through cooperation, through an active 
role in those positions which the bourgeoisie has left open and which are 
intended to serve the class enemy as a trap through which revolutionary energy 
can be absorbed and dissipated. All this the Communist must ban from their 
ranks, and when by this means they have been thoroughly purified, they will find 
themselves impelled all the more strongly towards their revolutionary work. This 
is how I would explain, in simple words and to the extent that the necessary 
time has been permitted me, just what the general line of the Communist 
International should be to enable it to fulfil a leading role.</p>

<p class="fst">And if we observe these matters from an international vantage 
point, we find that here also we will be able to summon forth the forces which 
will be able to carry this structure forward, the human class material from 
which this edifice will be built, these international workers' organisations, 
this revolutionary international. In France, in Spain, in Italy, even in America 
we find syndicalists and anarchists. Perhaps someone will cry out: 'Yes! You are 
an anarchist, a syndicalist!'</p>

<p class="fst">Let us dwell for a moment on these matters. It will be necessary 
to recognise that the most revolutionary elements of the working class have for 
many years been found amongst such people. We know of course, that they do not 
recognise the class struggle in conscious terms, the organised class struggle. 
But is it not the case, Comrades, that they entered history prematurely, their 
tactics were predated by decades ?</p>

<p class="fst">The methods adopted by the old workers' movement in Germany etc. 
were correct for that time but now, in the period of collapse, now the method of 
direct struggle is relevant. And these workers, these anarchists and 
syndicalists of the world, they do not have the experience of the collective 
strength and support that a workers' movement can bring to bear. In such a 
situation it is necessary for the Communists to intervene and to teach them how 
to lead the struggle, how to concentrate their forces. It is they who should 
bring them the form of organisation which they need in order that they may 
combine their ranks and within which they can unite. These same elements, 
however, demand that such a thorough break is made with all bourgeois remnants, 
that it will no longer be possible to return to the bourgeois path.</p>

<p class="fst">All those workers who have joined the anarchist and syndicalist 
camp have been provoked by the betrayal of the parliamentary leaders. But at 
least they have recognised how serious have been the errors committed by the 
parliamentary workers' movement. Our task therefore must be to draw them once 
again out of their present allegiance, and that means that it should be a matter 
of concern for Communists if they find themselves unable to devote themselves to 
this work. Indeed it is not even a matter just of this, since for Communists it 
is no longer merely a question of principle whether or not one rejects 
parliamentarism, whether or not one rejects the trades union movement: today 
these matters have become to a far greater degree than ever before, practical 
questions, and today history has placed them firmly on the agenda, has presented 
them for solution. If we observe matters in this way, we can see that it is 
precisely in America and the West European countries that large workers' 
organisations are to be found which demand an anti-parliamentary policy and a 
break with the trades union movement.</p>

<p class="fst">And so we now have before us, today, the question as to what 
decision this Congress will reach. Should it adopt the line of the old workers' 
movement, then it will also find its way to the same fatal end. But should it 
adopt, decisively and with a determined step, the path of unity with the left 
elements, who today are also to be found in Moscow; and should it recognise that 
there is much of value in them also, then the revolution will receive from the 
Third Congress of the Communist International a new forward driving force; on 
the other path, however, it will collapse into the sand and fall to pieces. It 
is the responsibility of the Congress to reach the correct decision. And it is 
from this standpoint also that we regard the question of our continued 
participation in the Third International.</p>
