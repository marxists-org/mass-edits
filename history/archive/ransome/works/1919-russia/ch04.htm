<h3>
First Days In Moscow
</h3>

<hr class="end" />
<p class="skip">&#160;</p>


<p>
It was a rare cold day when I struggled through the crowd
out of the station in Moscow, and began fighting with the
sledge-drivers who asked a hundred roubles to take me to
the Metropole.  I remembered coming here a year ago with
Colonel Robins, when we made ten roubles a limit for the
journey and often travelled for eight.  To-day, after heated
bargaining, I got carried with no luggage but a typewriter for
fifty roubles.  The streets were white with deep snow, less
well cleaned than the Petrograd streets of this year but better
cleaned than the Moscow streets of last year.  The tramways
were running.  There seemed to be at least as many sledges
as usual, and the horses were in slightly better condition than
last summer when they were scarcely able to drag
themselves along.  I asked the reason of the improvement,
and the driver told me the horses were now rationed like
human beings, and all got a small allowance of oats.  There
were crowds of people about, but the numbers of closed
shops were very depressing.  I did not then know that this
was due to the nationalization of trade and a sort of general
stock-taking, the object of which was to prevent
profiteering in manufactured goods, etc., of which there
were not enough to go round.[see: <a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/w/a.htm#war-communism">War Communism</a>]  Before I left many shops
were being reopened as national concerns, like our own
National Kitchens.  Thus, one would see over a shop the
inscription, "The 5th Boot Store of the Moscow Soviet" or
"The 3rd Clothing Store of the Moscow Soviet" or "The
11th Book Shop."  It had been found that speculators
bought, for example, half a dozen overcoats, and sold them
to the highest bidders, thus giving the rich an advantage over
the poor.  Now if a man needs a new suit he has to go in his
rags to his House Committee, and satisfy them that he really
needs a new suit for himself.  He is then given the right to
buy a suit.  In this way an attempt is made to prevent
speculation and to ensure a more or less equitable
distribution of the inadequate stocks.  My greatest surprise
was given me by the Metropole itself, because the old
wounds of the revolution, which were left unhealed all last
summer, the shell-holes and bullet splashes which marked it
when I was here before, have been repaired.
</p>
<p>
Litvinov had given me a letter to Karakhan of the
Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, asking him to help me in
getting a room.  I found him at the Metropole, still smoking
as it were the cigar of six months ago.  Karakhan, a
handsome Armenian, elegantly bearded and moustached,
once irreverently described by Radek as "a donkey of
classical beauty," who has consistently used such influence
as he has in favour of moderation and agreement with the
Allies, greeted me very cordially, and told me that the
foreign visitors were to be housed in the Kremlin.  I told him
I should much prefer to live in an hotel in the ordinary way,
and he at once set about getting a room for me. This was no
easy  business, though he obtained an authorization from
<a href="../../../../../glossary/people/s/v.htm#sverdlov">Sverdlov</a>, president of the executive committee, for me to
live where I wished, in the Metropole or the National, which
are mostly reserved for Soviet delegates, officials and
members of the Executive Committee.  Both were full, and
he finally got me a room in the old Loskutnaya Hotel, now
the Red Fleet, partially reserved for sailor delegates and
members of the Naval College.
</p>
<p>
Rooms are distributed on much the same plan as clothes.
Housing is considered a State monopoly, and a general
census of housing accommodation has taken place. In every
district there are housing committees to whom people
wanting rooms apply.  They work on the rough and ready
theory that until every man has one room no one has a right
to two.  An Englishman acting as manager of works near
Moscow told me that part of his house had been allotted to
workers in his factory, who, however, were living with him
amicably, and had, I think, allowed him to choose which
rooms he should concede.  This plan has, of course, proved
very hard on house-owners, and in some cases the new
tenants have made a horrible mess of the houses, as might,
indeed, have been expected, seeing that they had previously
been of  those who had suffered directly from the
decivilizing influences of overcrowding.  After talking for
some time we went round the corner to the Commissariat
for Foreign Affairs, where we found <a href="../../../../../glossary/people/c/h.htm#chicherin">Chicherin</a> who, I
thought, had aged a good deal and was (though this was
perhaps his manner) less cordial than Karakhan.  He asked
about England, and I told him Litvinov knew more about
that than I, since he had been there more recently.  He asked
what I thought would be the effect of his Note with detailed
terms published that day.  I told him that Litvinov, in an
interview which I had telegraphed, had mentioned somewhat
similar terms some time before, and that personally I
doubted whether the Allies would at present come to any
agreement with the Soviet Government, but that, if the
Soviet Government lasted, my personal opinion was that the
commercial isolation of so vast a country as Russia could
hardly be prolonged indefinitely on that account alone. (For
the general attitude to that Note, see page 44.)
</p>
<p>
I then met Voznesensky (<a href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#left-srs">Left Social Revolutionary</a>), of the
Oriental Department, bursting with criticism of the
Bolshevik attitude towards his party.  He secured a ticket for
me to get dinner in the Metropole.  This ticket I had to
surrender when I got a room in the National.  The dinner
consisted of a plate of soup, and a very small portion of
something else.  There are National Kitchens in different
parts of the town supplying similar meals.  Glasses of weak
tea were sold at 30 kopecks each, without sugar.  My sister
had sent me a small bottle of saccharine just before I left
Stockholm, and it was pathetic to see the childish delight
with which some of my friends drank glasses of sweetened
tea.
</p>
<p>
From the Metropole I went to the Red Fleet to get my room
fixed up.  Six months ago there were comparatively clean
rooms here, but the sailors have demoralized the hotel and
its filth is indescribable.  There was no heating and very little
light.  A samovar left after the departure of the last visitor
was standing on the table, together with some dirty
curl-papers and other rubbish.  I got the waiter to clean up
more or less, and ordered a new samovar.  He could not
supply spoon, knife, or fork, and only with great difficulty
was persuaded to lend me glasses.
</p>
<p>
The telephone, however, was working, and after tea I got
into touch with Madame Radek, who had moved from the
Metropole into the Kremlin.  I had not yet got a pass to the
Kremlin, so she arranged to meet me and get a pass for me
from the Commandant.  I walked through the snow to the
white gate at the end of the bridge which leads over the
garden up a steep incline to the Kremlin.  Here a fire of logs
was burning, and three soldiers were sitting around it.
Madame Radek was waiting for me, warming her hands at
the fire, and we went together into the citadel of the
republic.
</p>
<p>
A meeting of the People's Commissars was going on in the
Kremlin, and on an open space under the ancient churches
were a number of motors black on the snow.  We turned to
the right down the Dvortzovaya street, between the old
Cavalier House and the Potyeshny Palace, and went in
through a door under the archway that crosses the road, and
up some dark flights of stairs to a part of the building that
used, I think, to be called the Pleasure Palace.  Here, in a
wonderful old room, hung with Gobelins tapestries
absolutely undamaged by the revolution, and furnished with
carved chairs, we found the most incongruous figure of
the old Swiss internationalist, Karl Moor, who talked with
affection of Keir Hardie and of Hyndman, "in the days
when he was a socialist," and was disappointed to find that I
knew so little about them.  Madame Radek asked, of course,
for the latest news of Radek, and I told her that I had read in
the Stockholm papers that he had gone to Brunswick, and
was said to be living in the palace there.<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">(1)</a></sup>  She feared he might have been
in Bremen [Germany] when that town was taken by the Government
troops, and did not believe he would ever get back to Russia.
She asked me, did I not feel already (as indeed I did) the
enormous difference which the last six months had made in
strengthening the revolution.  I asked after old
acquaintances, and learnt that Pyatakov, who, when I last
saw him, was praying that the Allies should give him
machine rifles to use against the Germans in the Ukraine,
had been the first President of the Ukrainian Soviet
Republic, but had since been replaced by Rakovsky.  It had
been found that the views of the Pyatakov government
were further left than those of its supporters, and so
Pyatakov had given way to Rakovsky who was better able to
conduct a more moderate policy.  The [Soviet] Republic had been
proclaimed in Kharkov, but at that time Kiev was still in the
hands of the Directorate.    
</p>
<p>
That night my room in the Red Fleet was so cold that I went
to bed in a sheepskin coat under rugs and all possible
bedclothes with a mattress on the top.  Even so I slept very
badly.   
</p>
<p>
The next day I spent in vain wrestlings to get a better room.
Walking about the town I found it dotted with revolutionary
sculptures, some very bad, others interesting, all done in
some haste and set up for the celebrations of the anniversary
of the revolution last November [October].  The painters also had been
turned loose to do what they could with the hoardings, and
though the weather had damaged many of their pictures,
enough was left to show what an extraordinary carnival that
had been.  Where a hoarding ran along the front of a house
being repaired the painters had used the whole of it as a vast
canvas on which they had painted huge symbolic pictures
of the revolution.  A whole block in the Tverskaya was so
decorated.  Best, I think, were the row of wooden booths
almost opposite the Hotel National in the Okhotnia Ryadi.
These had been painted by the futurists or kindred artists,
and made a really delightful effect, their bright colours and
naif patterns seeming so natural to Moscow that I found
myself wondering how it was that they had never been so
painted before.  They used to be a uniform dull yellow.
Now, in clear primary colours, blue, red, yellow, with rough
flower designs, on white and chequered back-grounds, with
the masses of snow in the road before them, and
bright-kerchiefed women and peasants in ruddy sheepskin coats
passing by, they seemed less like futurist paintings than like
some traditional survival, linking new Moscow with the
Middle Ages.  It is perhaps interesting to note that certain
staid purists in the Moscow Soviet raised a protest while I
was there against the license given to the futurists to spread
themselves about the town, and demanded that the art of the
revolution should be more comprehensible and less violent.
These criticisms, however, did not apply to the row of
booths which were a pleasure to me every time I passed
them.
</p>
<p>
In the evening I went to see Reinstein in the National.
Reinstein is a little old grandfather, a member of the
<a href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/u/n.htm#usslp">American Socialist Labour Party</a>, who was tireless in helping
the Americans last year, and is a prodigy of knowledge
about the revolution.  He must be nearly seventy, never
misses a meeting of the Moscow Soviet or the Executive
Committee, gets up at seven in the morning, and goes from
one end of Moscow to the other to lecture to the young men
in training as officers for the Soviet Army, more or less
controls the English soldier war prisoners, about whose
Bolshevism he is extremely pessimistic, and enjoys an
official position as head of the quite futile department which
prints hundred-weight upon hundred-weight of
propaganda in English, none of which by any chance ever
reaches these shores.  He was terribly disappointed that I had
brought no American papers with me.  He complained of
the lack of transport, a complaint which I think I must have
heard at least three times a day from different people the
whole time I was in Moscow.  Politically, he thought, the
position could not be better, though economically it was very
bad.  When they had corn, as it were, in sight, they could
not get it to the towns for lack of locomotives.  These
economic difficulties were bound to react sooner or later on
the political position.
</p>
<p>
He talked about the English prisoners.  The men are brought
to Moscow, where they are given special passports and are
allowed to go anywhere they like about the town without
convoy of any kind.  I asked about the officers, and he said
that they were in prison but given everything possible, a
member of the International Red Cross, who worked with
the Americans when they were here, visiting them regularly
and is taking in parcels for them.  He told me that on hearing
in Moscow that some sort of fraternization was going on on
the Archangel front, he had hurried off there with two
prisoners, one English and one American.  With some
difficulty a meeting was arranged.  Two officers and a
sergeant from the Allied side and Reinstein and these two
prisoners from the Russian, met on a bridge midway
between the opposing lines.  The conversation seemed
to have been mostly an argument about working-class
conditions in America, together with reasons why the Allies
should go home and leave Russia alone.  Finally the Allied
representatives (I fancy Americans) asked Reinstein to come
with them to Archangel and state his case, promising him
safe conduct there and back.  By this time two Russians had
joined the group, and one of them offered his back as a
desk, on which a safe-conduct for Reinstein was written.
Reinstein, who showed me the safe-conduct, doubted its
validity, and said that anyhow he could not have used it
without instructions from Moscow.  When it grew dusk they
prepared to separate.  The officers said to the prisoners,
"What?  Aren't you coming back with us?" The two shook
their heads decidedly, and said, "No, thank you."
</p>
<p>
I learnt that some one was leaving the National next day to
go to Kharkov, so that I should probably be able to get a
room.  After drinking tea with Reinstein till pretty late, I
went home, burrowed into a mountain of all sorts of clothes,
and slept a little.     
</p>
<p>
In the morning I succeeded in making out my claim to
the room at the National, which turned out to be a very
pleasant one, next door to the kitchen and therefore quite
decently warm.  I wasted a lot of time getting my stuff
across.  Transport from one hotel to the other, though the
distance is not a hundred yards, cost forty roubles.  I got
things straightened out, bought some books, and prepared a
list of the material needed and the people I wanted to see.
</p>
<p>
The room was perfectly clean.  The  chamber-maid
who came in to tidy up quite evidently took
a  pride in doing her work properly, and protested against
my throwing matches on the floor.  She said she had been in
the hotel since it was opened.  I asked her how she liked the
new regime.  She replied that there was not enough to eat,
but that she felt freer.
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon I went downstairs to the main kitchens of
the hotel, where there is a permanent supply of hot water.
One enormous kitchen is set apart for the use of people
living in the hotel.  Here I found a crowd of people, all using
different parts of the huge stove.  There was an old
grey-haired Cossack, with a scarlet tunic under his black,
wide-skirted, narrow-waisted coat, decorated in the
Cossack fashion with ornamental cartridges.  He was
warming his soup, side by side with a little Jewess making
potato-cakes.  A spectacled elderly member of the
Executive Committee was busy doing something with a little
bit of meat.  Two little girls were boiling potatoes in old tin
cans.  In another room set apart for washing a sturdy little
long-haired revolutionary was cleaning a shirt.  A woman
with her hair done up in a blue handkerchief was very
carefully ironing a blouse.  Another was busy stewing sheets,
or something of that kind, in a big cauldron.  And all the
time people from all parts of the hotel were coming with
their pitchers and pans, from fine copper kettles to
disreputable empty meat tins, to fetch hot water for tea.  At
the other side of the corridor was a sort of counter in front
of a long window opening into yet another kitchen.  Here
there was a row of people waiting with their own saucepans
and plates, getting their dinner allowances of soup and meat
in exchange for tickets.  I was told that people thought they
got slightly more if they took their food in this way
straight from the kitchen to their own rooms instead of being
served in the restaurant.  But I watched closely, and decided
it was only superstition.  Besides, I had not got a saucepan.   
</p>
<p>
On paying for my room at the beginning of the week I was
given a card with the days of the week printed along its
edge.  This card gave me the right to buy one dinner daily,
and when I bought it that day of the week was snipped off
the card so that I could not buy another.  The meal consisted
of a plate of very good soup, together with a second course
of a scrap of meat or fish.  The price of the meal varied
between five and seven roubles.   
</p>
<p>
One could obtain this meal any time between two and seven.
Living hungrily through the morning, at two o'clock I used to
experience definite relief in the knowledge that now at any
moment I could have my meal.  Feeling in this way less
hungry, I used then to postpone it hour by hour, and actually
dined about five or six o'clock.  Thinking that I might indeed
have been specially favoured I made investigations, and
found that the dinners supplied at the public feeding
houses (the equivalent of our national kitchens) were of
precisely the same size and character, any difference
between the meals depending not on the food but on the
cook.    
</p>
<p>
A kind of rough and ready co-operative system also
obtained.  One day there was a notice on the stairs that those
who wanted could get one pot of jam apiece by applying to
the provisioning committee of the hotel.  I got a pot of jam
in this way, and on a later occasion a small quantity of
Ukrainian sausage. 
</p>
<p>
Besides the food obtainable on cards it was possible to buy,
at ruinous prices, food from speculators, and an idea of the
difference in the prices may be obtained from the following
examples: Bread is one rouble 20 kopecks per pound by
card and 15 to 20 roubles per pound from the speculators.
Sugar is 12 roubles per pound by card, and never less than
50 roubles per pound in the open market.  It is obvious that
abolition of the card system would mean that the rich would
have enough and the poor nothing.  Various methods have
been tried in the effort to get rid of speculators whose
high profits naturally decrease the willingness of the villages
to sell bread at less abnormal rates.  But as a Communist
said to me, "There is only one way to get rid of speculation,
and that is to supply enough on the card system.  When
People can buy all they want at 1 rouble 20 they are not
going to pay an extra 14 roubles for the encouragement of
speculators." "And when will you be able to do that?" I
asked.  "As soon as the war ends, and we can use our
transport for peaceful purposes."
</p>
<p>
There can be no question about the starvation of Moscow.
On the third day after my arrival in Moscow I saw a man
driving a sledge laden with, I think, horseflesh, mostly
bones, probably dead sledge horses.  As he drove a black
crowd of crows followed the sledge and perched on it,
tearing greedily at the meat.  He beat at them continually
with his whip, but they were so famished that they took no
notice whatever.  The starving crows used even to force
their way through the small ventilators of the windows in my
hotel to pick up any scraps they could find inside.  The
pigeons, which formerly crowded the streets,
utterly undismayed by the traffic, confident in the
security given by their supposed connection with religion,
have completely disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Nor can there be any question about the cold.  I resented my
own sufferings less when I found that the State Departments
were no better off than other folk.  Even in the Kremlin I
found the Keeper of the Archives sitting at work in an old
sheepskin coat and felt boots, rising now and then to beat
vitality into his freezing hands like a London cabman of old
times.
