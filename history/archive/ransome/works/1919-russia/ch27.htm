<h3>
The Third International
</h3>

<hr class="end" />


<h4>
March 3rd.
</h4>


<p>
One day near the end of February, Bucharin, hearing that I
meant to leave quite soon, said rather mysteriously, "Wait a
few days longer, because something of international
importance is going to happen which will certainly be of
interest for your history." That was the only hint I got of
the preparation of the <a href="../../../../../glossary/events/c/comintern.htm#first-congress">Third International</a>.  Bucharin refused
to say more.  On March 3rd Reinstein looked in about nine
in the morning and said he had got me a guest's ticket for
the conference in the Kremlin, and wondered why I had not
been there the day before, when it had opened.  I told him I
knew nothing whatever about it; Litvinov and Karakhan,
whom I had seen quite recently, had never mentioned it,
and guessing that this must be the secret at which Bucharin
had hinted, I supposed that they had purposely kept
silence.  I therefore rang up Litvinov, and asked if they
had had any reason against my going. He said that he had
thought it would not interest me.  So I went.  The
Conference was still a secret.  There was nothing about it in
the morning papers.

</p>
<p>
The meeting was in a smallish room, with a dais at one end,
in the old Courts of Justice built in the time of Catherine the
Second, who would certainly have turned in her grave if
she had known the use to which it was being put.  Two
very smart soldiers of the Red Army were guarding the
doors.  The whole room, including the floor, was decorated
in red.  There were banners with "Long Live the Third
International" inscribed upon them in many languages.  The
Presidium was on the raised dais at the end of the room,
Lenin sitting in the middle behind a long red-covered table
with Albrecht, a young German <a href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/s/p.htm#spartacist">Spartacist</a>, on the right and
Platten, the Swiss, on the left.  The auditorium sloped down
to the foot of the dais.  Chairs were arranged on each side
of an alleyway down the middle, and the four or five front
rows had little tables for convenience in writing.
Everybody of importance was there; Trotzky,
Zinoviev, Kamenev, Chichern, Bucharin, Karakhan,
Litvinov, Vorovsky, Steklov, Rakovsky, representing here
the Balkan Socialist Party, Skripnik, representing the
Ukraine.  Then there were Stang (Norwegian Left
Socialists), Grimlund (Swedish Left), Sadoul (France),
Finberg (British Socialist Party), Reinstein (American
Socialist Labour Party), a Turk, a  German-Austrian,
a Chinese, and so on.  Business was conducted and
speeches were made in all languages, though
where possible German was used, because more of the
foreigners knew German than knew French.  This was
unlucky for me.

</p>
<p>
When I got there people were making reports about the
situation in the different countries.  Finberg spoke in
English, Rakovsky in French, Sadoul also.  Skripnik, who,
being asked, refused to talk German and said he would
speak in either Ukrainian or Russia, and to most people's
relief chose the latter, made several interesting points about
the new revolution in the Ukraine.  The killing of the
leaders under the Skoropadsky regime had made no
difference to the movement, and town after town was
falling after internal revolt. (This was before they had
Kiev and, of course, long before they had taken Odessa,
both of which gains they confidently prophesied.) The
sharp lesson of German occupation had taught the
Ukrainian Social Revolutionaries what their experiences
during the last fifteen months had taught the Russian, and
all parties were working together.
</p>
<p>
But the real interest of the gathering was in its attitude
towards the <a href="../../../../../glossary/events/b/e.htm#berne-international-conference">Berne conference</a>.  Many letters had been
received from members of that conference, Longuet for
example, wishing that the Communists had been
represented there, and the view taken at Moscow was that
the left wing at Berne was feeling uncomfortable at sitting
down with Scheidemann and Company; let them definitely
break with them, finish with the Second International and
join the Third.  It was clear that this gathering in the
Kremlin was meant as the nucleus of a new International
opposed to that which had split into national groups, each
supporting its own government in the prosecution of the
war.  That was the leit motif of the whole affair.

</p>
<p>
Trotsky, in a leather coat, military breeches and
gaiters, with a fur hat with the sign of the Red Army in
front, was looking very well, but a strange figure for those
who had known him as one of the greatest
anti-militarists in Europe.  Lenin sat quietly listening,
speaking when necessary in almost every European
language with astonishing ease.  Balabanova talked about
Italy and seemed happy at last, even in Soviet Russia, to be
once more in a "secret meeting." It was really an
extraordinary affair and, in spite of some childishness, I
could not help realizing that I was present at something that
will go down in the histories of socialism, much like that
other strange meeting convened in London in 1848.
</p>
<p>

The vital figures of the conference, not counting Platten,
whom I do not know and on whom I can express no
opinion, were Lenin and the young German, Albrecht, who,
fired no doubt by the events actually taking place in his
country, spoke with brain and character.  The German
Austrian also seemed a real man.  Rakovsky, Skripnik, and
Sirola the Finn really represented something.  But there was
a make-believe side to the whole affair, in which the
English Left Socialists were represented by Finberg, and
the Americans by Reinstein, neither of whom had or was
likely to have any means of communicating with his
constituents.
</p>

<h4>
March 4th.

<p>
In the Kremlin they were discussing the programme on
which the new International was to stand.  This is, of
course, dictatorship of the proletariat and all that that
implies.  I heard, Lenin make <a href="../../../../../archive/lenin/works/1919/mar/comintern.htm#s2">a long speech</a>, the main point
of which was to show that Kautsky and his supporters at
Berne were now condemning the very tactics which they
had praised in 1906.  When I was leaving the Kremlin I met
Sirola walking in the square outside the building without a
hat, without a coat, in a cold so intense that I was putting
snow on my nose to prevent frostbite.  I exclaimed.  Sirola
smiled his ingenuous smile. "It is March," he said, "Spring
is coming."
</p>

<h4>
March 5th.
</h4>


<p>
Today all secrecy was dropped, a little prematurely, I
fancy, for when I got to the Kremlin I found that the first
note of opposition had been struck by the man who least of
all was expected to strike it.  Albrecht, the young German,
had opposed the immediate founding of the Third
International, on the double ground that not all nations were
properly represented and that it might make difficulties for
the political parties concerned in their own countries.
Every one was against him.  Rakovsky pointed out that the
same objections could have been raised against the
founding of the First International by Marx in London.  The
German-Austrian combated Albrecht's second point.
Other people said that the different parties concerned had
long ago definitely broken with the Second International.
Albrecht was in a minority of one.  It was decided therefore
that this conference was actually the Third International.
Platten announced the decision, and the "International" was
sung in a dozen languages at once.  Then Albrecht stood
up, a little red in the face, and said that he, of course,
recognized the decision and would announce it in Germany.

<h4>
March 6th.    
</h4>

<p>
The conference in the Kremlin ended with the usual singing
and a photograph.  Some time before the end, when
Trotsky had just finished speaking and had left the tribune,
there was a squeal of protest from the photographer who
had just trained his apparatus.  Some one remarked "The
Dictatorship of the Photographer," and, amid general
laughter, Trotsky had to return to the tribune and stand
silent while the unabashed photographer took two pictures.
The founding of the Third International had been
proclaimed in the morning papers, and an extraordinary
meeting in the Great Theatre announced for the evening.  I
got to the theatre at about five, and had difficulty in getting
in, though I had a special ticket as a correspondent.  There
were queues outside all the doors.  The Moscow Soviet was
there, the Executive Committee, representatives of the
Trades Unions and the Factory Committees, etc.  The huge
theatre and the platform were crammed, people standing in
the aisles and even packed close together in the wings of
the stage.  Kamenev opened the meeting by a solemn
announcement of the founding of the Third
International in the Kremlin.  There was a roar of applause
from the audience, which rose and sang the "International"
in a way that I have never heard it sung since the
All-Russian Assembly when the news came of the strikes in
Germany during the Brest negotiations.  Kamenev then
spoke of those who had died on the way, mentioning
Liebknecht and Rosa Luxembourg, and the whole theatre
stood again while the orchestra played, "You fell as
victims." Then Lenin spoke.  If I had ever thought that
Lenin was losing his personal popularity, I got my answer
now.  It was a long time before he could speak at all,
everybody standing and drowning his attempts to speak
with roar after roar of applause.  It was an extraordinary,
overwhelming scene, tier after tier crammed with workmen,
the parterre filled, the whole platform and the wings.  A
knot of workwomen were close to me, and they almost
fought to see him, and shouted as if each one were
determined that he should hear her in particular.  He spoke
as usual, in the simplest way, emphasizing the fact that the
revolutionary struggle everywhere was forced to use the
Soviet forms. "We declare our solidarity with
the aims of the Sovietists," he read from an Italian
paper, and added, "and that was when they did not
know what our aims were, and before we had an
established programme ourselves." Albrecht made
a very long reasoned speech for Spartacus, which
was translated by Trotsky.  Guilbeau, seemingly a mere
child, spoke of the socialist movement in France.  Steklov
was translating him when I left.  You must remember that I
had had nearly two years of such meetings, and am not a
Russian.  When I got outside the theatre, I found at each
door a disappointed crowd that had been unable to get in.

</p>
<p>
The proceedings finished up next day with a review in the
Red Square and a general holiday.

</p>
<p>
If the Berne delegates had come, as they were expected,
they would have been told by the Communists that they
were welcome visitors, but that they were not regarded as
representing the International.  There would then have
ensued a lively battle over each one of the delegates, the
Mensheviks urging him to stick to Berne, and the
Communists urging him to express allegiance to the
Kremlin.  There would have been demonstrations and
counter-demonstrations, and altogether I am very sorry
that it did not happen and that I was not there to see.
