<h3>
To Petrograd
</h3>

<hr class="end" />


<p>
On January 30 a party of four newspaper correspondents,
two Norwegians, a Swede and myself, left Stockholm to go
into Russia.  We travelled with the members of the Soviet
Government's Legation, headed by Vorovsky and Litvinov,
who were going home after the breaking off of official
relations by Sweden.  Some months earlier I had got leave
from the Bolsheviks to go into Russia to get further material
for my history of the revolution, but at the last moment there
was opposition and it seemed likely that I should be refused
permission.  Fortunately, however, a copy of the Morning
Post reached Stockholm, containing a report of a lecture by
Mr. Lockhart in which he had said that as I had been out of
Russia for six months I had no right to speak of conditions
there. Armed with this I argued that it would be very
unfair if I were not allowed to come and see things for
myself.  I had no further difficulties.
</p>
<p>
We crossed by boat to Abo <span class="inote">[aka Turku, 100km west of Helsinki]</span>, grinding our way through the
ice, and then travelled by rail to the Russian frontier, taking
several days over the journey owing to delays variously
explained by the Finnish authorities.  We were told that the
Russian <a href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/w/h.htm#white-guards">White Guards</a> had planned an attack on the train.
Litvinov, half-smiling, wondered if they were purposely giving time
to the White Guards to organize such an attack.  Several
nervous folk inclined to that opinion.  But at Viborg we
were told that there were grave disorders in <a href="../../../../../glossary/places/p/e.htm#petrograd">Petrograd</a> and
that the Finns did not wish to fling us into the middle of a
scrimmage.  Then someone obtained a newspaper and we
read a detailed account of what was happening.  This
account was, as I learnt on my return, duly telegraphed to
England like much other news of a similar character.  There
had been a serious revolt in Petrograd.  The Semenovsky
regiment had gone over to the mutineers, who had seized the
town.  The Government, however, had escaped to
Kronstadt, whence they were bombarding Petrograd with
naval guns.   
</p>
<p>

This sounded fairly lively, but there was nothing to be done,
so we finished up the chess tournament we had begun on the
boat.  An Esthonian won it, and I was second, by reason of
a lucky win over Litvinov, who is really a better player.  By
Sunday night we reached Terijoki and on Monday moved
slowly to the frontier of Finland close to Bieloostrov.  A
squad of Finnish soldiers was waiting, excluding everybody
from the station and seeing that no dangerous revolutionary
should break away on Finnish territory.  There were no
horses, but three hand sledges were brought, and we piled
the luggage on them, and then set off to walk to the frontier
duly convoyed by the Finns.  A Finnish lieutenant walked at
the head of the procession, chatting good-humouredly in
Swedish and German, much as a man might think it worth
while to be kind to a crowd of unfortunates just about to be
flung into a boiling cauldron. We walked a few hundred
yards along the line and then turned into a road deep in
snow through a little bare wood, and so down to the little
wooden bridge over the narrow frozen stream that
separates Finland from Russia.  The bridge, not twenty yards
across, has a toll bar at each end, two sentry boxes and two
sentries.  On the Russian side the bar was the familiar black
and white of the old Russian Empire, with a sentry box to
match.  The Finns seemingly had not yet had time to paint
their bar and box. <sup class="ednote"><a href="#A" name="Ab">[A]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Finns lifted their toll bar, and the Finnish officers
leading our escort walked solemnly to the middle of the
bridge.  Then the luggage was dumped there, while we stood
watching the trembling of the rickety little bridge under the
weight of our belongings, for we were all taking in with us as
much food as we decently could.  We were none of us
allowed on the bridge until an officer and a few men had
come down to meet us on the Russian side.  Only little Nina,
Vorovskv's daughter, about ten years old, chattering
Swedish with the Finns, got leave from them, and shyly, step
by step, went down the other side of the bridge and struck
up acquaintance with the soldier of the Red Army who stood
there, gun in hand, and obligingly bent to show her
the sign, set in his hat, of the crossed sickle and hammer
of the Peasants' and Workmen's Republic.  At last the
Finnish lieutenant took the list of his prisoners and called out
the names "Vorovsky, wife and one bairn [child]," looking
laughingly over his shoulder at Nina flirting with the sentry.
Then "Litvinov," and so on through all the Russians, about
thirty of them.  We four visitors, Grimlund the Swede,
Puntervald and Stang, the Norwegians, and I, came last.  At
last, after a general shout of farewell, and "Helse Finland"
from Nina, the Finns turned and went back into their
civilization, and we went forward into the new struggling
civilization of Russia.  Crossing that bridge we passed from
one philosophy to another, from one extreme of the class
struggle to the other, from a <a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/d/i.htm#dictatorship-bourgeoisie">dictatorship of the bourgeoisie</a>
to a <a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/d/i.htm#dictatorship-proletariat">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>.
</p>
<p>
The contrast was noticeable at once.  On the Finnish side of
the frontier we had seen the grandiose new frontier station,
much larger than could possibly be needed, but quite a good
expression of the spirit of the new Finland.  On the Russian
side we came to the same grey old wooden station known
to all passengers to and from Russia for polyglot [multi-lingual] profanity
and passport difficulties.  There were no porters, which was
not surprising because there is barbed wire and an extremely
hostile sort of neutrality along the frontier and traffic across
has practically ceased.  In the buffet [counter of light refreshments], which was very cold,
no food could be bought.  The long tables once laden with
caviare and other zakuski [Russian hors d'oeuvres] were bare.  There was, however, a
samovar [a metal urn for making tea], and we bought tea at sixty kopecks a glass and
lumps of sugar at two roubles fifty [kopecks] each.  We took our tea
into the inner passport room, where I think a stove must
have been burning the day before, and there [we] made some sort
of a meal off some of Puntervald's Swedish hard-bread.  It
is difficult for me to express the curious mixture of
depression and exhilaration that was given to the party by
this derelict starving station combined with the feeling that
we were no longer under guard but could do more or less as
we liked.  It split the party into two factions, of which one
wept while the other sang.  Madame Vorovsky, who had not
been in Russia since the <a href="../../../../../glossary/events/f/e.htm#february-1917">first [February] revolution</a>, frankly wept, but
she wept still more in Moscow where she found that even
as the wife of a high official of the Government she enjoyed
no privileges which would save her from the hardships of
the population.  But the younger members of the party,
together with Litvinov, found their spirits irrepressibly rising
in spite of having no dinner.  They walked about the village,
played with the children, and sang, not revolutionary songs,
but just jolly songs, any songs that came into their heads.
When at last the train came to take us into Petrograd, and we
found that the carriages were unheated, somebody got out a
mandoline and we kept ourselves warm by dancing.  At the
same time I was sorry for the five children who were with
us, knowing that a country simultaneously suffering war,
blockade and revolution is not a good place for childhood.
But they had caught the mood of their parents,
revolutionaries going home to their revolution, and trotted
excitedly up and down the carriage or anchored themselves
momentarily, first on one person's knee and then on
another's.
</p>
<p>
It was dusk when we reached Petrograd.  The Finland
Station, of course, was nearly deserted, but here there
were four porters, who charged two hundred and fifty
roubles for shifting the luggage of the party from one end of
the platform to the other.  We ourselves loaded it into the
motor lorry sent to meet us, as at Bieloostrov we had loaded
it into the van.  There was a long time to wait while rooms
were being allotted to us in various hotels, and with several
others I walked outside the station to question people about
the mutiny and the bombardment of which we had heard in
Finland.  Nobody knew anything about it.  As soon as the
rooms were allotted and I knew that I had been lucky
enough to get one in the Astoria, I drove off across the
frozen river by the Liteini Bridge.  The trams were running.
The town seemed absolutely quiet, and away down the river
I saw once again in the dark, which is never quite dark
because of the snow, the dim shape of the fortress, and
passed one by one the landmarks I had come to know so
well during the last six years &mdash; the Summer Garden, the
British Embassy, and the great Palace Square where I had
seen armoured cars flaunting about during the July rising,
soldiers camping during the hysterical days of the
Kornilov affair and, earlier, Kornilov himself reviewing the
Junkers.  My mind went further back to the March [February]
revolution, and saw once more the picket fire of the
revolutionaries at the corner that night when the remains of
the Tzar's Government were still frantically printing
proclamations ordering the people to go home, at the very
moment while they themselves were being besieged in the
Admiralty.  Then it flung itself further back still, to the day
of the declaration of war, when I saw this same square filled
with people, while the Tzar came out for a moment on the
Palace balcony.  By that time we were pulling up at the
Astoria and I had to turn my mind to something else.
</p>
<p>
The Astoria is now a bare barrack of a place, but
comparatively clean.  During the war and the first part of the
revolution it was tenanted chiefly by [tsarist] officers, and owing to
the idiocy of a few of these at the time of the first [February] revolution
in shooting at a perfectly friendly crowd of soldiers and
sailors, who came there at first with no other object than to
invite the officers to join them, the place was badly smashed
up in the resulting scrimmage.  I remember with Major
Scale fixing up a paper announcing the fall of Bagdad either
the night this happened or perhaps the night before.  People
rushed up to it, thinking it some news about the revolution,
and turned impatiently away.  All the damage has been
repaired, but the red carpets have gone, perhaps to make
banners, and many of the electric lights were not burning,
probably because of the shortage in electricity.  I got my
luggage upstairs to a very pleasant room on the fourth floor.
Every floor of that hotel had its memories for me.  In this
room lived that brave reactionary officer who boasted that
he had made a raid on the Bolsheviks and showed little
<a href="../../../../../glossary/people/k/o.htm#kollontai-alexandre">Madame Kollontai's</a> hat as a trophy.  In this I used to listen
to Perceval Gibbon when he was talking about how to write
short stories and having influenza.  There was the room
where Miss Beatty used to give tea to tired revolutionaries
and to still more tired enquirers into the nature of revolution
while she wrote the only book that has so far appeared
which gives anything like a true impresionist picture of those
unforgettable days. ["The Red Heart of Russia."]  Close
by was the room where poor Denis Garstin used to talk
of the hunting he would have when the war should come to
an end.
</p>
<p>
I enquired for a meal, and found that no food was to be had
in the hotel, but they could supply hot water.  Then, to get
an appetite for sleep, I went out for a short walk, though I
did not much like doing so with nothing but an English
passport, and with no papers to show that I had any right to
be there.  I had, like the other foreigners, been promised
such papers but had not yet received them.  I went round to
the Regina, which used to be one of the best hotels in the
town, but those of us who had rooms there were
complaining so bitterly that I did not stay with them, but
went off along the Moika to the Nevsky and so back to my
own hotel.  The streets, like the hotel, were only half lit, and
hardly any of the houses had a lighted window.  In the old
sheepskin coat I had worn on the front and in my high fur
hat, I felt like some ghost of the old regime visiting a town
long dead.  The silence and emptiness of the streets
contributed to this effect.  Still, the few people I met or
passed were talking cheerfully together and the rare
sledges and motors had comparatively good roads, the
streets being certainly better swept and cleaned than they
have been since the last winter of the Russian Empire.

Finland had been a part of Russia for over 200 years.  After the October revolution, the Soviet government gave the people of Finland full independence, with which they created their own country.
