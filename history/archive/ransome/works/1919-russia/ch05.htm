<h3>
The Executive Committee On The Reply
To The Prinkipo Proposal
</h3>

<h4>
February 10th.
</h4>

<hr class="end" />
<p class="skip">&#160;</p>


<p>
It will be remembered that a proposal was made by the
Peace Conference that the various de facto governments of
Russia should meet on an island in the Bosphorus to discuss
matters, an armistice being arranged meanwhile.  No direct
invitation was sent to the Soviet Government.  After
attempting to obtain particulars through the editor of a
French socialist paper, Chicherin on February 4th sent a
long note to the Allies.  The note was not at first considered
with great favour in Russia, although it was approved by the
opposition parties on the right, the Mensheviks even going
so far as to say that in sending such a note, the Bolsheviks
were acting in the interest of the whole of the Russian
people.  The opposition on the left complained
that it was a betrayal of the revolution into the
hands of the Entente, and there were many Bolsheviks
who said openly that they thought it went a little
too far in the way of concession.  On February 10th, the
Executive Committee met to consider the international
position.
</p>
<p>
Before proceeding to an account of that meeting, it will be
well to make a short summary of the note in question.
Chicherin, after referring to the fact that no invitation had
been addressed to them and that the absence of a reply from
them was being treated as the rejection of a proposal they
had never received, said that in spite of its more and more
favourable position, the Russian Soviet Government
considered a cessation of hostilities so desirable that it was
ready immediately to begin negotiations, and, as it had more
than once declared, to secure agreement "even at the cost of
serious concessions in so far as these should not threaten the
development of the Republic." "Taking into consideration
that the enemies against whom it has to struggle borrow their
strength of resistance exclusively from the help shown them
by the powers of the Entente, and that therefore these
powers are the only actual enemy of the Russian Soviet
Government, the latter addresses itself precisely to the
powers of the Entente, setting out the points on which it
considers such concessions possible with a view to the
ending of every kind of conflict with the aforesaid powers."
There follows a list of the concessions they are prepared to
make.  The first of these is recognition of their debts, the
interest on which, "in view of Russia's difficult financial
position and her unsatisfactory credit," they propose to
guarantee in raw materials.  Then, "in view of the interest
continually expressed by foreign capital in the question of
the exploitation for its advantage of the natural resources of
Russia, the Soviet Government is ready to give to subjects of
the powers of the Entente mineral, timber and other
concessions, to be defined in detail, on condition that the
economic and social structure of Soviet Russia shall not be
touched by the internal arrangements of these concessions."
The last point is that which roused most opposition.  It
expresses a willingness to negotiate even concerning such
annexations, hidden or open, as the Allies may have in
mind.  The words used are "The Russian Soviet
Government has not the intention of excluding at all costs
consideration of the question of annexations, etc. . . ." Then,
"by annexations must be understood the retention on this or
that part of the territory of what was the Russian Empire,
not including Poland and Finland [which were already granted independence by the Soviet Government], of armed forces of the
Entente or of such forces as are maintained by the
governments of the Entente or enjoy their financial, military,
technical or other support."  There follows a statement that
the extent of the concessions will depend on the military
position.  Chicherin proceeds to give a rather optimistic
account of the external and internal situation.  Finally he
touches on the question of propaganda.  "The Russian
Soviet Government, while pointing out that it cannot limit
the freedom of the revolutionary press, declares its
readiness, in case of necessity to include in the general
agreement with the powers of the Entente the obligation not
to interfere in their internal affairs." The note ends thus:
"On the foregoing bases the Russian Soviet Government is ready
immediately to begin negotiations either on Prinkipo island
or in any other place whatsoever with all the powers of the
Entente together or with separate powers of their number, 
or with any Russian political groupings whatsoever, 
according to the wishes of the powers of the Entente.
The Russian Soviet Government begs the powers of the
Entente immediately to inform it whither to send
its representatives, and precisely when and by what route." 
This note was dated February 4th, and was sent out by wireless.

</p>
<p>
From the moment when the note appeared in the
newspapers of February 5th, it had been the main subject of
conversation.  Every point in it was criticized and
counter-criticized, but even its critics, though anxious to preserve
their criticism as a basis for political action afterwards, were
desperately anxious that it should meet with a reply.  No one
in Moscow at that time could have the slightest misgiving
about the warlike tendencies of the revolution.  The
overwhelming mass of the people and of the revolutionary
leaders want peace, and only continued warfare forced upon
them could turn their desire for peace into desperate,
resentful aggression.  Everywhere I heard the same story:
"We cannot get things straight while we have to fight all the
time." They would not admit it, I am sure, but few of the
Soviet leaders who have now for eighteen months been
wrestling with the difficulties of European Russia have not
acquired, as it were in spite of themselves, a national,
domestic point of view.  They are thinking less about world
revolution than about getting bread to Moscow, or
increasing the output of textiles, or building river
power-stations to free the northern industrial district from
its dependence on the distant coal-fields.  I was
consequently anxious to hear what the Executive Committee
would have to say, knowing that there I should listen to
some expression of the theoretical standpoint from which
my hard-working friends had been drawn away by interests
nearer home.
</p>
<p>
The Executive Committee met as usual in the big hall of the
Hotel Metropole, and it met as usual very late.  The sitting
was to begin at seven, and, foolishly thinking that Russians
might have changed their nature in the last six months, I was
punctual and found the hall nearly empty, because a
party meeting of the Communists in the room next door was
not finished.  The hall looked just as it used to look, with a
red banner over the presidium and another at the opposite
end, both inscribed "The All Russian Executive Committee,"
"Proletariat of all lands, unite," and so on.  As the room
gradually filled, I met many acquaintances. 
</p>
<p>
Old Professor Pokrovsky came in, blinking through his
spectacles, bent a little, in a very old coat, with a small black
fur hat, his hands clasped together, just as, so I have been
told, he walked unhappily to and fro in the fortress at <a href="../../../../../glossary/places/b/r.htm#brest-litovsk">Brest</a>
during the second period of the negotiations.  I did not think
he would recognize me, but he came up at once, and
reminded me of the packing of the archives at the time when
it seemed likely that the Germans would take Petrograd.  He
told me of a mass of material they are publishing about the
origin of the war.  He said that England came out of it best
of anybody, but that France and Russia showed in a very
bad light.    
</p>
<p>
Just then, Demian Bledny rolled in, fatter than he used to be
(admirers from the country send him food) with a round
face, shrewd laughing eyes, and cynical mouth, a typical
peasant, and the poet of the revolution.  He was passably
shaved, his little yellow moustache was trimmed, he was
wearing new leather breeches, and seemed altogether a more
prosperous poet than the untidy ruffian I first met about a
year or more ago before his satirical poems in Pravda and
other revolutionary papers had reached the heights of
popularity to which they have since attained.  In the old days
before the revolution in Petrograd he used to send his poems
to the revolutionary papers.  A few were published and
scandalized the more austere and  serious-minded
revolutionaries, who held a meeting to decide
whether any more were to be printed.  Since the
revolution, he has rapidly come into his own, and is now a
sort of licensed jester, flagellating Communists and
non-Communists alike.  Even in this assembly
he had about him a little of the manner of
Robert Burns in Edinburgh society.  He told me
with expansive glee that they had printed two
hundred and fifty thousand of his last book, that the whole
edition was sold in two weeks, and that he had had his
portrait painted by a real artist.  It is actually true that of his
eighteen different works, only two are obtainable today.   
</p>
<p>
Madame Radek, who last year showed a genius for the
making of sandwiches with chopped leeks [scallions], and did good
work for Russia as head of the Committee for dealing with
Russian war prisoners, came and sat down beside me, and
complained bitterly that the authorities wanted to turn her
out of the grand ducal apartments in the Kremlin and make
them into a historical museum to illustrate the manner of life
of the Romanovs.  She said she was sure that was simply an
excuse and that the real reason was that Madame Trotsky
did not like her having a better furnished room than her
own.  It seems that the Trotskys, when they moved into the
Kremlin, chose a lodging extremely modest in comparison
with the gorgeous place where I had found Madame Radek.    

</p>
<p>
All this time the room was filling, as the party meeting ended
and the members of the Executive Committee came in to
take their places.  I was asking Litvinov whether he was
going to speak, when a little hairy energetic man came up
and with great delight showed us the new matches
invented in the Soviet laboratories.  Russia is short of
match-wood, and without paraffin.  Besides which I think I am
right in saying that the bulk of the matches used in the north
came from factories in Finland.  In these new Bolshevik
matches neither wood nor paraffin is used.  Waste paper is a
substitute for one, and the grease that is left after cleaning
wool is a substitute for the other.  The little man, Berg,
secretary of the Presidium of the Council of Public
Economy, gave me a packet of his matches.  They are like
the matches in a folding cover that used to be common in
Paris.  You break off a match before striking it.  They strike
and burn better than any matches I have ever bought in
Russia, and I do not see why they should not be made in
England, where we have to import all the materials of which
ordinary matches are made.  I told Berg I should try to
patent them and so turn myself into a capitalist.  Another
Communist, who was listening, laughed, and said that most
fortunes were founded in just such a fraudulent way.
</p>
<p>

Then there was Steklov of the <a href="../../../../../glossary/periodicals/i/z.htm#izvestia">Izvestia</a>,  Madame
Kollontai, and a lot of other people whose
names I do not remember.  Little <a href="../../../../../glossary/people/b/u.htm#bukharin-nikolai">Bucharin</a>, the editor of
Pravda and one of the most interesting talkers in Moscow,
who is ready to discuss any philosophy you like, from
Berkeley and Locke down to Bergson and William James,
trotted up and shook hands.  Suddenly a most unexpected
figure limped through the door.  This was the lame Eliava of
the Vologda Soviet, who came up in great surprise at seeing
me again, and reminded me how Radek and I, hungry from
Moscow, astonished the hotel of the Golden Anchor by
eating fifteen eggs apiece, when we came to Vologda last
summer (I acted as translator during Radek's conversations
with the American Ambassador and Mr. Lindley).  Eliava is
a fine, honest fellow, and had a very difficult time in
Vologda where the large colony of foreign embassies and
missions naturally became the centre of disaffection in a
district which at the time was full of inflammable material.  I
remember when we parted from him, Radek said to me that
he hardly thought he would see him alive again.  He told me
he had left Vologda some three months ago and was now
going to Turkestan.  He did not disguise the resentment
he felt towards M. Noulens (the French Ambassador) who,
he thought, had stood in the way of agreement last year, but
said that he had nothing whatever to say against Lindley.  

</p>
<p>
At last there was a little stir in the raised presidium, and the
meeting began.  When I saw the lean, long-haired Avanesov
take his place as secretary, and Sverdlov, the president, lean
forward a little, ring his bell, and announce that the meeting
was open and that "Comrade Chicherin has the word," I
could hardly believe that I had been away six months. 

</p>
<p>
Chicherin's speech took the form of a general report on the
international situation.  He spoke a little more clearly than he
was used to do, but even so I had to walk round to a place
close under the tribune before I could hear him.  He
sketched the history of the various steps the Soviet
Government has taken in trying to secure peace, even
including such minor "peace offensives" as Litvinov's
personal telegram to President Wilson.  He then weighed, in
no very hopeful spirit, the possibilities of this last Note to all
the Allies having any serious result.  He estimated the
opposing tendencies for and against war with Russia in each
of the principal countries concerned.  The growth of
revolutionary feeling abroad made imperialistic governments
even more aggressive towards the Workers' and Peasants'
Republic than they would otherwise be.  It was now making
their intervention difficult, but no more.  It was impossible to
say that the collapse of Imperialism had gone so far that it
had lost its teeth.  Chicherin speaks as if he were a dead man
or a ventriloquist's lay figure.  And indeed he is half-dead.
He has never learnt the art of releasing himself from
drudgery by handing it over to his subordinates.  He is
permanently tired out.  You feel it is almost cruel to say
"Good morning" to him when you meet him, because of the
appeal to be left alone that comes unconsciously into his
eyes.  Partly in order to avoid  people, partly because he is
himself accustomed to work at night, his section of the
foreign office keeps extraordinary hours, is not to be found
till about five in the afternoon and works till four in the
morning.  The actual material of his report was interesting,
but there was nothing in its manner to rouse enthusiasm
of any kind.  The audience listened with attention, but only
woke into real animation when with a shout of laughter it
heard an address sent to Clemenceau by the emigre financiers, aristocrats and bankrupt politicians of the Russian
colony in Stockholm, protesting against any sort of
agreement with the Bolsheviks.

</p>
<p>
Bucharin followed Chicherin.  A little eager figure in his
neat brown clothes (bought, I think, while visiting Berlin as a
member of the Economic Commission), he at least makes
himself clearly heard, though his voice has a funny tendency
to breaking.  He compared the present situation with the
situation before Brest.  He had himself (as I well remember)
been with Radek, one of the most violent opponents of the
Brest peace, and he now admitted that at that time Lenin had
been right and he wrong.  The position was now different,
because whereas then imperialism was split into two camps
fighting each other, it now showed signs of uniting its forces.
He regarded the <a href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/l/e.htm#league-nations">League of Nations</a> as a sort of capitalist
syndicate, and said that the difference in the French and
American attitude towards the League depended upon
the position of French and American capital.  Capital in
France was so weak, that she could at best be only a small
shareholder.  Capital in America was in a very advantageous
position.  America therefore wanted a huge All-European
syndicate in which each state would have a certain number
of shares.  America, having the greatest number of shares,
would be able to exploit all the other nations.  This is a fixed
idea of Bucharin's, and he has lost no opportunity of putting
out this theory of the League of Nations since the middle of
last summer.  As for Chicherin's Note, he said it had at least
great historical interest on account of the language it used,
which was very different from the hypocritical language of
ordinary diplomacy.  Here were no phrases about noble
motives, but a plain recognition of the facts of the case.
"Tell us what you want," it says, "and we are ready to buy
you off, in order to avoid armed conflict." Even if the Allies
gave no answer the Note would still have served a useful
purpose and would be a landmark in history.


</p>
<p>
Litvinov followed Bucharin.  A solid, jolly, round man, with
his peaked grey fur hat on his head, rounder than ever in
fur-collared, thick coat, his eye-glasses slipping from his
nose as he got up, his grey muffler hanging from his neck,
he hurried to the tribune.  Taking off his things and leaving
them on a chair below, he stepped up into the tribune with
his hair all rumpled, a look of extreme seriousness on his
face, and spoke with a voice whose capacity and strength
astonished me who had not heard him speak in public
before.  He spoke very well, with more sequence than
Bucharin, and much vitality, and gave his summary of the
position abroad.  He said (and Lenin expressed the same
view to me afterwards) that the hostility of different
countries to Soviet Russia varied in direct proportion to their
fear of revolution at home.  Thus France, whose capital had
suffered most in the war and was weakest, was the most
uncompromising, while America, whose capital was in a
good position, was ready for agreement.  England, with
rather less confidence, he thought was ready to follow
America.  Need of raw material was the motive tending
towards agreement with Russia.  Fear that the mere
existence of a Labour Government anywhere in the
world strengthens the revolutionary movement elsewhere,
was the motive for the desire to wipe out the Soviet at all
cost.  Chicherin's note, he thought, would emphasize the
difference between these opposing views and would  tend to
make impossible an alliance of the capitalists against Russia.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Kamenev, now President of the Moscow Soviet,
spoke, objecting to Bucharin's comparison of the peace now
sought with that of Brest Litovsk.  Then everything was in a
state of experiment and untried.  Now it was clear to the
world that the unity of Russia could be achieved only under
the Soviets.  The powers opposed to them could not but
recognize this fact.  Some parts of Russia (Ukraine) had
during the last fifteen months experienced every kind of
government, from the Soviets, the dictatorship of the
proletariat, to the dictatorship of foreign invaders and the
dictatorship of a General of the old regime, and they had
after all returned to the Soviets.  Western European
imperialists must realize that the only Government in Russia
which rested on the popular masses was the Government
of the Soviets and no other.  Even the paper of the
Mensheviks, commenting on Chicherin's note, had declared
that by this step the Soviet Government had shown that it
was actually a national Government acting in the interests of
the nation.  He further read a statement by Right Social
Revolutionaries (delegates of that group, members of the
Constituent Assembly, were in the gallery) to the effect that
they were prepared to help the Soviet Government as the
only Government in Russia that was fighting against a
dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.  

</p>
<p>
Finally, the Committee unanimously passed a resolution
approving every step taken in trying to obtain peace, and at
the same time "sending a fraternal greeting to the Red Army
of workers and peasants engaged in ensuring the
independence of Soviet Russia." The meeting then turned to
talk of other things.

</p>
<p>
I left, rather miserable to think how little I had foreseen
when Soviet Russia was compelled last year to sign an
oppressive peace with Germany, that the time would
come when they would be trying to buy peace from
[England].  As I went out I saw another unhappy figure,
unhappy for quite different reasons.  Angelica Balabanova,
after dreaming all her life of socialism in the most fervent
Utopian spirit, had come at last to Russia to find that a
socialist state was faced with difficulties at least as real as
those which confront other states, that in the battle there was
little sentiment and much cynicism, and that dreams worked
out in terms of humanity in the face of the opposition of the
whole of the rest of the world are not easily recognized by
their dreamers.  Poor little Balabanova, less than five feet
high, in a black coat that reached to her feet but did not
make her look any taller, was wandering about like a lost and
dejected spirit.  Not so, she was thinking, should socialists
deal with their enemies.  Somehow, but not so.  Had the
silver trumpets blown seven times in vain, and was it really
necessary to set to work and, stone by stone, with bleeding
hands, level the walls of Jericho?

</p>
<p>
There was snow falling as I walked home.  Two workmen,
arguing, were walking in front of me. "If only it were not
for the hunger," said one.  "But will that ever change?" said
the other.
