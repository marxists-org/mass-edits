<p>
At Sukhanov's suggestion I went, to see Professor
Timiriazev, the greatest Russian Darwinian, well-known to
many scientific men in this country, a foreign member of
the Royal Society, a Doctor of Cambridge University and a
Bolshevik.  He is about eighty years old.  His left arm is
paralysed, and, as he said, he can only work at his desk and
not be out and about to help as he would wish.  A
venerable old savant, he was sitting writing with a green
dressing gown about him, for his little flat was very cold.
On the walls were portraits of Darwin, Newton and Gilbert,
besides portraits of contemporary men of science whom he
had known.  English books were everywhere.  He gave me,
two copies of his last scientific book and his latest portrait
to take to two of his friends in England.

</p>
<p>
He lives with his wife and son.  I asked if his son were also a Bolshevik.

<p class="quote">
"Of course," he replied.

</p>
<p>
He then read me a letter he had written protesting against
intervention. He spoke of his old love for England and for
the English people.  Then, speaking of the veil of lies
drawn between Soviet Russia and the rest of the world, he
broke down altogether, and bent his head to hide his tears.
</p>
<p class="quote">

"I suffer doubly," he said, after excusing himself for the
weakness of a very old man.  "I suffer as a Russian, and, if
I may say so, I suffer as an Englishman.  I have English
blood in my veins.  My mother, you see, looks quite
English," pointing to a daguerreotype on the wall, "and my
grandmother was actually English.  I suffer as an
Englishman when I see the country that I love misled by
lies, and I suffer as a Russian because those lies concern
the country to which I belong, and the ideas which I am
proud to hold."    

</p>
<p>
The old man rose with difficulty, for he, like every one else
in Moscow, is half starved.  He showed me his Byron, his
Shakespeare, his Encyclopaedia Britannica, his English
diplomas.  He pointed to the portraits on the wall.  "If I
could but let them know the truth," he said, "those friends
of mine in England, they would protest against actions
which are unworthy of the England we have loved
together."
