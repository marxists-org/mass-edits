The Crisis in Russia

<hr class="base" size="1">
<h3>INDUSTRIAL CONSCRIPTION
</h3>
<hr class="end">



<p>
The general principle of industrial conscription recognized
by the Russian Constitution, section ii, chapter v, paragraph
18, which reads: "The Russian Socialist Federate Soviet
Republic recognizes that work is an obligation on every
citizen of the Republic," and proclaims, "He who does not
work shall not eat."  It is, however, one thing to proclaim
such a principle and quite another to put it into action.
</p>



<p>
On December 17, 1919, the moment it became clear that
there was a real possibility that the civil war was drawing to
an end, Trotsky allowed the Pravda to print a memorandum
of his, consisting of "theses" or reasoned notes about
industrial conscription and the militia system.  He points out
that a Socialist State demands a general plan for the
utilization of all the resources of a country, including its
human energy.  At the same time, "in the present economic
chaos in which are mingled the broken fragments of the
past and the beginnings of the future," a sudden jump to a
complete centralized economy of the country as a whole is
impossible.  Local initiative, local effort must not be
sacrificed for the sake of a plan.  At the same time industrial
conscription is necessary for complete socialization.  It
cannot be regardless of individuality like military
conscription.  He suggests a subdivision of the State into
territorial productive districts which should coincide with the
territorial districts of the militia system which shall replace
the regular army.  Registration of labor necessary.
Necessary also to coordinate military and industrial
registration.  At demobilization the cadres of regiments,
divisions, etc., should form the fundamental cadres of the
militia.  Instruction to this end should be included in the
courses for workers and peasants who are training to
become officers in every district.  Transition to the militia
system must be carefully and gradually accomplished so as
not for a moment to leave the Republic defenseless.  While
not losing sight of these ultimate aims, it is necessary to
decide on immediate needs and to ascertain exactly what
amount of labor is necessary for their limited
realization. He suggests the registration of skilled labor in the
army.  He suggests that a Commission under general
direction of the Council of Public Economy should work out
a preliminary plan and then hand it over to the War
Department, so that means should be worked out for using
the military apparatus for this new industrial purpose.
</p>


<p>
Trotsky's twenty-four theses or notes must have been written
in odd moments, now here now there, on the way from one
front to another.  They do not form a connected whole.
Contradictions jostle each other, and it is quite clear that
Trotsky himself had no very definite plan in his head.  But
his notes annoyed and stimulated so many other people that
they did perhaps precisely the work they were intended to
do. Pravada printed them with a note from the editor
inviting discussion.  The Ekonomitcheskaya Jizn printed
letter after letter from workmen, officials and others,
attacking, approving and bringing new suggestions.
Larin, Semashko, Pyatakov, Bucharin all took a hand in the
discussion.  Larin saw in the proposals the beginning of the
end of the revolution, being convinced that authority
would pass from the democracy of the workers into the
hands of the specialists.  Rykov fell upon them with sturdy
blows on behalf of the Trades Unions.  All, however, agreed
on the one point-that something of the sort was neccesary.
On December 27th a Commission for studying the question
of industrial conscription was formed under the presidency
of Trotsky.  This Commission included the People's
Commissars, or Ministers, of Labor, Ways of
Communication, Supply, Agriculture, War, and the
Presidents of the Central Council of the Trades Unions and
of the Supreme Council of Public Economy.  They compiled
a list of the principal questions before them, and invited
anybody interested to bring them suggestions and material
for discussion.
</p>


<p>
But the discussion was not limited to the newspapers or to
this Commission.  The question was discussed in Soviets and
Conferences of every kind all over the country.  Thus, on
January 1st an All-Russian Conference of local
"departments for the registration and distribution of labor,"
after prolonged argument, contributed their views.  They
pointed out </p><p class="indentb">(1) the need of bringing to work numbers
of persons who instead of doing the skilled labor for which
they were qualified were engaged in petty profiteering, etc.;
</p><p class="indentb">(2) that there evaporation of skilled labor into unproductive
speculation  could at least be checked by the introduction of
labor books, which would give some sort of registration of
each citizen's work; </p><p class="indentb">(3) that workmen can be brought back
from the villages only for enterprises which are supplied
with provisions or are situated in districts where there is
plenty. ("The opinion that, in the absence of these
preliminary conditions, it will be possible to draw workmen
from the villages by measures of compulsion or mobilization
is profoundly mistaken.") </p><p class="indentb">(4) that there should be a census
of labor and that the Trades Unions should be invited to
protect the interests of the conscripted.  </p><p>Finally, this
Conference approved the idea of using the already existing
military organization for carrying out a labor census of the
Red Army, and for the turning over to labor of parts of the
army during demobilization, but opposed the idea of giving
the military organization the work of labor registration and
industrial conscription in general.
</p>


<p>
On January 22, 1920, the Central Committee of the
Communist Party, after prolonged discussion  of Trotsky's
rough memorandum, finally adopted and published a new
edition of the "theses," expanded, altered, almost
unrecognizable, a reasoned body of theory entirely different
from the bundle of arrows loosed at a venture by Trotsky.
They definitely accepted the principle of industrial
conscription, pointing out the immediate reasons for it in the
fact that Russia cannot look for much help from without and
must somehow or other help herself.
</p>


<p>
Long before the All-Russian Congress of the Communist
Party approved the theses of the Committee, one form of
industrial conscription was already being tested at work.
Very early in January, when the discussion on the subject
was at its height, the Soviet of the Third Army addressed
itself to the Council of Defense of the Republic with an
invitation to make use of this army (which at least for the
moment had finished its military task) and to experiment
with it as a labor army.  The Council of Defense agreed.
Representatives of the Commissariats of Supply,
Agriculture, Ways and Communications, Labor and the
Supreme Council of Public Economy were sent to assist the
Army Soviet.  The army was proudly re-named "The First
Revolutionary Army of Labor," and began to issue communiques
from the Labor front," precisely like the communiques of an army
in the field.  I translate as a curiosity the first communique issued
by a Labor Army's Soviet:
</p>


<p class="quote">
"Wood prepared in the districts of Ishim, Karatulskaya, Omutinskaya,
Zavodoutovskaya, Yalutorovska, Iushaly, Kamuishlovo, Turinsk,
Altynai, Oshtchenkovo, Shadrinsk, 10,180 cubic sazhins.
Working days, 52,651.  Taken to the railway stations, 5,334 cubic
sazhins.  Working days on transport, 22,840.  One hundred carpenters
detailed for the Kizelovsk mines.  One hundred carpenters detailed for
the bridge at Ufa.  One engineer specialist detailed to the
Government Council of Public Economy for repairing the mills of
Chelyabinsk Government.  One instructor accountant detailed for
auditing the accounts of the economic organizations of Kamuishlov.
Repair of locomotives procceding in the works at Ekaterinburg.
January 20, 1920, midnight."
</p>


<p>
The Labor Army's Soviet received a report on the state
of the district covered by the army with regard to supply and
needed work.  By the end of January it had already carried
out a labor census of the army, and found that it included
over 50,000 laborers, of whom a considerable number were
skilled.  It decided on a general plan of work in
reestablishing industry in the Urals, which suffered severely
during the Kolchak regime and the ebb and flow of the civil
war, and was considering a suggestion of one of its members
that if the scheme worked well the army should be increased
to 300,000 men by way of mobilization.
</p>


<p>
On January 23rd the Council of Defense of the Republic,
encouraged to proceed further, decided to make use of the
Reserve Army for the improvement of railway transport on
the Moscow-Kazan railway, one of the chief arteries
between eastern food districts and Moscow.  The main
object is to be the reestablishment of through traffic between
Moscow and Ekaterinburg and the repair of the Kazan-Ekaterinburg
line, which particularly suffered during the war.  An attempt was
to be made to rebuild the bridge over the Kama River
before the ice melts.  The Commander of the Reserve Army
was appointed Commissar of the eastern part of the Moscow-Kazan
railway, retaining his position as Commander of the Army.
With a view of coordination between the Army Soviet and
the railway authorities, a member of the Soviet was also appointed
Commissar of the railway.  On January 25th it was
announced that a similar experiment was being made in the
Ukraine.  A month before the ice broke the first train
actually crossed the Kama River by the rebuilt bridge.
</p>


<p>
By April of this year the organization of industrial
conscription had gone far beyond the original labor armies.
A decree of February 5th had created a Chief Labor
Committee, consisting of five members, Serebryakov and Danilov,
from the Commissariat of War; Vasiliev, from the
Commissariat of the Interior; Anikst, from the Commissariat
of Labor; Dzerzhinsky, from the Commissariat of Internal
Affairs.  Dzerzhinsky was President, and his appointment
was possibly made in the hope that the reputation he had
won as President of the Extraordinary Committee for
Fighting Counter-Revolution would frighten people into
taking this Committee seriously.  Throughout the country in
each government or province similar committees, called
"Troikas," were created, each of three members, one from
the Commissariat of War, one from the Department of
Labor, one from the Department of Management, in each
case from the local Commissariats and Departments attached
to the local Soviet.  Representatives of the Central Statistical
Office and its local organs had a right to be present at the
meeting of these committees of three, or "Troikas," but had
not the right to vote.  An organization or a factory requiring
labor, was to apply to the Labor Department of the local
Soviet.  This Department was supposed to do its best to
satisfy demands upon it by voluntary methods first.  If these
proved insufficient they were to apply to the local "Troika,"
or Labor Conscription Committee.  If this found that its
resources also were insufficient, it was to refer back the
request to the Labor Department of the Soviet, which was
then to apply to its corresponding Department in the
Government Soviet, which again, first voluntarily and then
through the Government Committee of Labor Conscription, was
to try to satisfy the demands.  I fancy the object of
this arrangement was to prevent local "Troikas" from
referring to Government "Troikas," and so directly to Dzerzhinsky's
Central Committee.  If they had been able to
do this there would obviously have been danger lest a new
network of independent and powerful organizations should
be formed.  Experience with the overgrown and
insuppressible Committees for Fighting Counter-Revolution
had taught people how serious such a development might be.
</p>

<p>
Such was the main outline of the scheme for conscripting
labor.  A similar scheme was prepared for superintending
and safeguarding labor when conscripted.  In every factory
of over 1,000 workmen, clerks, etc., there was formed a
Commission (to distinguish it from the Committee) of
Industrial Conscription.  Smaller factories shared such
Commissions or were joined for the purpose to larger
factories near by.  These Commissions were to be under the
direct control of a Factory Committee, thereby preventing
squabbles between conscripted and non-conscripted labor.
They were to be elected for six months, but their members
could be withdrawn and replaced by the Factory
Committee with the approval of the local "Troika."
These Commissions, like the "Troikas," consisted of three
members: (1) from the management of the factory, (2) from
the Factory Committee, (3) from the Executive Committee
of the workers. (It was suggested in the directions that one
of these should be from the group which "has been
organizing 'Saturdayings,' that is to say that he or she should
be a Communist.)The payment of conscripted workers was
to be by production, with prizes for specially good work.
Specially bad work was also foreseen in the detailed scheme
of  possible punishments.  Offenders were to be brought
before the "People's Court" (equivalent to the ordinary Civil
Court), or, in the case of repeated or very bad offenses,
were to be brought before the far more dreaded
Revolutionary Tribunals.  Six categories of possible offenses
were placed upon the new code:
</p>


<p class="indentb">
(1)Avoiding registration, absenteeism, or desertion.<br />
(2)The preparation of false documents or the use of such.<br />
(3)Officials giving false information to facilitate these crimes.<br />
(4)Purposeful damage of instruments or material.<br />
(5)Uneconomical or careless work.<br />
(6)(Probably the most serious of all) Instigation to any of
these actions.<br />
</p>


<p>
The "Troikas" have the right to deal administratively with the
less important crimes by deprival of freedom for not more
than two weeks.  No one can be brought to trial except by
the Committee for Industrial Conscription on the initiative of
the responsible director of work, and with the approval
either of the local labor inspection authorities or with that of
the local Executive Committee.
</p>


<p>
No one with the slightest knowledge of Russia will suppose
for a moment that this elaborate mechanism sprang suddenly
into existence when the decree was signed.  On the contrary,
all stages of industrial conscription exist simultaneously even
today, and it would be possible by going from one part of
Russia to another to collect a series of specimens of industrial
conscription at every stage of evolution, just as one
can collect all stages of man from a baboon to a company
director or a Communist.  Some of the more primitive
kinds of conscription were not among the least successful.
For example, at the time(in the spring of the year)when the
Russians still hoped that the Poles would be content with the
huge area of non-Polish territory they had already seized, the
army on the western front was without any elaborate system
of decrees being turned into a labor army.  The work done
was at first ordinary country work, mainly woodcutting.
They tried to collaborate with the local "Troikas," sending
help when these Committees asked for it.  This, however,
proved unsatisfactory, so, disregarding the "Troikas," they
organized things for themselves in the whole area
immediately behind the front.  They divided up the forests
into definite districts, and they worked these with soldiers
and with deserters.  Gradually their work developed, and
they built themselves narrow-gauge railways for the
transport of the wood.  Then they needed wagons and
locomotives, and of course immediately found themselves at
loggerheads with the railway authorities.  Finally, they
struck a bargain with the railwaymen, and were allowed to
take broken-down wagons which the railway people were
not in a position to mend. Using such skilled labor as
they had, they mended such wagons as were given them,
and later made a practice of going to the railway yards and
in    inspecting "sick" wagons for themselves, taking out any
that they thought had a chance even of temporary
convalescence.  Incidentally they caused great scandal by
finding in the Smolensk sidings among the locomotives and
wagons supposed to be sick six good locomotives and
seventy perfectly healthy wagons.  Then they began to
improve the feeding of their army by sending the wood they
had cut, in the trains they had mended, to people who
wanted wood and could give them provisions.  One such
train went to Turkestan and back from the army near Smolensk.
Their work continually increased, and since they
had to remember that they were an army and not merely a
sort of nomadic factory, they began themselves to mobilize,
exclusively for purposes of work, sections of the civil
population.  I asked Unshlicht, who had much to do with
this organization, if the peasants came willingly.  He said,
"Not very," but added that they did not mind when they
found that they got well fed and were given packets of salt
as prizes for good work.  "The peasants," he said, "do
not grumble against the Government when it shows the sort
of common sense that they themselves can understand.  We
found that when we said definitely how many carts and men
a village must provide, and used them without delay for a
definite purpose, they were perfectly satisfied and
considered it right and proper.  In every case, however,
when they saw people being mobilized and sent thither
without obvious purpose or result, they became hostile at
once."  I asked Unshlicht how it was that their army still
contained skilled workmen when one of the objects of
industrial conscription was to get the skilled workmen back
into the factories.  He said: "We have an accurate census of
the army, and when we get asked for skilled workmen for
such and such a factory, they go there knowing that they still
belong to the army."
</p>


<p>
That, of course, is the army point of view, and indicates one
of the main squabbles which industrial conscription has
produced.  Trotsky would like the various armies to turn into
units of a territorial militia, and at the same time to be an
important part of the labor organization of each district.
His opponents do not regard the labor armies as a permanent
manifestation, and many have gone so far as to say that the
productivity of labor in one of these armies is lower than
among ordinary workmen.  Both sides produce figures on
this point, and Trotsky goes so far as to say that if his
opponents are right, then not only are labor armies damned,
but also the whole principle of industrial conscription.  "If
compulsory labor-independently of social condition-is
unproductive, that is a condemnation not of the labor
armies, but of industrial conscription in general, and with it
of the whole Soviet system, the further development of
which is unthinkable except on a basis of universal industrial
conscription."
</p>


<p>
But, of course, the question of the permanence of the labor
armies is not so important as the question of getting the
skilled workers back to the factories.  The comparative
success or failure of soldiers or mobilized peasants in cutting
wood is quite irrelevant to this recovery of the vanished
workmen.  And that recovery will take time, and will be
entirely useless unless it is possible to feed these workers
when they have been collected.  There have already
been several attempts, not wholly successful, to collect the
straying workers of particular industries.  Thus, after the freeing
of the oil-wells from the Whites, there was a general
mobilization of naphtha workers.  Many of these had bolted
on or after the arrival of Krasnov or Denikin and gone far
into Central Russia, settling where they could.  So months
passed before the Red Army definitely pushed the area of
civil war beyond the oil-wells, that many of these refugees
had taken new root and were unwilling to return.  I believe,
that in spite of the mobilization, the oil-wells are still short of
men.  In the coal districts also, which have passed through
similar experiences, the proportion of skilled to unskilled
labor is very much smaller than it was before the war.
There have also been two mobilizations of railway workers,
and these, I think, may be partly responsible for the
undoubted improvement noticeable during the year,
although this is partly at least due to other things beside
conscription.  In the first place Trotsky carried with him into
the Commissariat of Transport the same ferocious energy
that he has shown in the Commissariat of War, together
with the prestige that he had gained there.  Further, he
was well able in the councils of the Republic to defend the
needs of his particular Commissariat against those of all
others.  He was, for example able to persuade the
Communist Party to treat the transport crisis precisely as
they had treated each crisis on the front-that is to say, to
mobilize great numbers of professed Communists to meet it,
giving them in this case the especial task of getting engines
mended and, somehow or other, of keeping trains on the
move.
</p>


<p>
But neither the bridges mended and the wood cut by the
labor armies, nor the improvement in transport, are any final
proof of the success of industrial conscription.  Industrial
conscription in the proper sense of the words is impossible
until a Government knows what it has to conscript.  A
beginning was made early this year by the introduction of
labor books, showing what work people were doing and
where, and serving as a kind of industrial passports.  But in
April this year these had not yet become general in Moscow
although the less unwieldy population of Petrograd was
already supplied with them.  It will be long even if it is
possible at all, before any  considerable proportion of
the people not living in these two cities are registered in this
way.  A more useful step was taken at the end of August, in a
general census throughout Russia. There has been no
Russian census since 1897.  There was to have been another
about the time the war began. It was postponed for obvious
reasons.  If the Communists carry through the census with
even moderate success (they will of course have to meet
every kind of evasion), they will at least get some of the
information without which industrial conscription on a
national scale must be little more than a farce.  The census
should show them where the skilled workers are.  Industrial
conscription should enable them to collect them and put
them at their own skilled work.  Then if, besides
transplanting them, they are able to feed them, it will be
possible to judge of the success or failure of a scheme which
in most countries would bring a Government toppling to the
ground.
</p>


<p class="quote">
"In most countries"; yes, but then the economic crisis has
gone further in Russia than in most countries.  There is talk
of introducing industrial conscription (one year's service) in
Germany, where things have not gone nearly so far.
And perhaps industrial conscription, like Communism itself,
becomes a thing of desperate hope only in a country actually
face to face with ruin.  I remember saying to Trotsky, when
talking of possible opposition, that I, as an Englishman, with
the tendencies to practical anarchism belonging to my race,
should certainly object most strongly if I were mobilized and
set to work in a particular factory, and might even want to
work in some other factory just for the sake of not doing
what I was forced to do.  Trotsky replied: "You would now.
But you would not if you had been through a revolution,
and seen your country in such a state that only the united,
concentrated effort of everybody could possibly reestablish
it.  That is the position here.  Everybody knows the position
and that there is no other way."
