The Crisis in Russia
</p>



<hr class="base" size="1">
<h3>WHAT THE COMMUNISTS ARE TRYING TO
DO IN RUSSIA
</h3>
<hr class="end">



<p>
We come now to the Communist plans for reconstruction.
We have seen, in the first two chapters, something of the
appalling paralysis which is the most striking factor in the
economic problem to-day.  We have seen how Russia is
suffering from a lack of things and from a lack of labor, how
these two shortages react on each other, and how nothing
but a vast improvement in transport can again set in motion
what was one of the great food-producing machines of the
world.  We have also seen something of the political
organization which, with far wider ambitions before it, is at
present struggling to prevent temporary paralysis from
turning into permanent atrophy.  We have seen that it
consists of a political party so far dominant that the Trades
Unions and all that is articulate in the country may be
considered as  part of a machinery of propaganda, for
getting those things done which that political party considers
should be done.  In a country fighting, literally, for its life,
no man can call his soul his own, and we have seen how this
fact-a fact that has become obvious again and again in the
history of the world, whenever a nation has had its back to
the wall-is expressed in Russia in terms of industrial
conscription; in measures, that is to say, which would be
impossible in any country not reduced to such extremities; in
measures which may prove to be the inevitable
accompaniment of national crisis, when such crisis is
economic rather than military.  Let us now see what the
Russians, with that machinery at their disposal are trying to do.
</p>


<p>
It is obvious that since this machinery is dominated by a
political party, it will be impossible to understand the
Russian plans, without understanding that particular political
party's estimate of the situation in general.  It is obvious that
the Communist plans for Russia must be largely affected by
their view of Europe as a whole.  This view is gloomy in the
extreme.  The Communists believe that Europe is steadily
shaking itself to pieces.  They believe that this
process has already gone so far that, even given good will on
the part of European Governments, the manufacturers of
Western countries are already incapable of supplying them
with all the things which Russia was importing before the
war, still less make up the enormous arrears which have
resulted from six years of blockade.  They do not agree with
M. Clemenceau that "revolution is a disease attacking
defeated countries only."  Or, to put it as I have heard it
stated in Moscow, they believe that President Wilson's
aspiration towards a peace in which should be neither
conqueror nor conquered has been at least partially realized
in the sense that every country ended the struggle
economically defeated, with the possible exception of
America, whose signature, after all, is still to be ratified.
They believe that even in seemingly prosperous countries the
seeds of economic disaster are already fertilized.  They think
that the demands of labor will become greater and more
difficult to fulfill until at last they become incompatible with
a continuance of the capitalist system.  They think that strike
after strike, irrespective of whether it is successful or
not, will gradually widen the cracks and flaws already
apparent in the damaged economic structure of Western
Europe.  They believe that conflicting interests will involve
our nations in new national wars, and that each of these will
deepen the cleavage between capital and labor.  They think
that even if exhaustion makes mutual warfare on a large
scale impossible, these conflicting interests will produce such
economic conflicts, such refusals of cooperation, as will turn
exhaustion to despair.  They believe, to put it briefly, that
Russia has passed through the worst stages of a process to
which every country in Europe will be submitted in turn by
its desperate and embittered inhabitants.  We may disagree
with them, but we shall not understand them if we refuse to
take that belief into account.  If, as they imagine, the next
five years are to be years of disturbance and growing
resolution, Russia will get very little from abroad.  If, for
example, there is to be a serious struggle in England, Russia
will get practically nothing.  They not only believe that these
things are going to be, but make the logical deductions as to
the effect of such disturbances on their own chances of
importing what they need.  For example, Lenin said to me
that "the shock of revolution in England would ensure the
final defeat of capitalism," but he said at the same time that
it would be felt at once throughout the world and cause such
reverberations as would paralyze industry everywhere.  And
that is why, although Russia is an agricultural country, the
Communist plans for her reconstruction are concerned first
of all not with agriculture, but with industry.  In their
schemes for the future of the world, Russia's part is that of a
gigantic farm, but in their schemes for the immediate future
of Russia, their eyes are fixed continually on the nearer
object of making her so far self-supporting that, even if
Western Europe is unable to help them, they may be able to
crawl out of their economic difficulties, as Krassin put it to
me before he left Moscow, "if necessary on all fours, but
somehow or other, crawl out."
</p>


<p>
Some idea of the larger ambitions of the Communists with
regard to the development of Russia are given in a
conversation with Rykov, which follows this chapter.  The
most important characteristic of them is that they are
ambitions which cannot but find an echo in Russians of
any kind, quite regardless of their political convictions.  The
old anomalies of Russian industry, for example, the
distances of the industrial districts from their sources of fuel
and raw material are to be done away with.  These
anomalies were largely due to historical accidents, such as
the caprice of Peter the Great, and not to any economic
reasons.  The revolution, destructive as it has been, has at
least cleaned the slate and made it possible, if it is possible to
rebuild at all, to rebuild Russia on foundations laid by
common sense.  It may be said that the Communists are
merely doing flamboyantly and with a lot of flag-waving,
what any other Russian Government would be doing in their
place.  And without the flamboyance and the flag-waving, it
is doubtful whether in an exhausted country, it would be
possible to get anything done at all.  The result of this is that
in their work of economic reconstruction the Communists
get the support of most of the best engineers and other
technicians in the country, men who take no interest
whatsoever in the ideas of Karl Marx, but have a
professional interest in doing the best they can with their
knowledge, and a patriotic satisfaction in using
that knowledge for Russia.  These men, caring not at all
about Communism, want to make Russia once more a
comfortably habitable place, no matter under what
Government.  Their attitude is precisely comparable to that
of the officers of the old army who have contributed so
much to the success of the new.  These officers were not
Communists, but they disliked civil war, and fought to put
an end of it.  As Sergei Kamenev, the Commander-in-Chief,
and not a Communist, said to me, "I have not looked on the
civil war as on a struggle between two political ideas, for the
Whites have no definite idea.  I have considered it simply as
a struggle between the Russian Government and a number
of mutineers." Precisely so do these "bourgeois" technicians
now working throughout Russia regard the task before them.
It will be small satisfaction to them if famine makes the
position of any Government impossible.  For them the
struggle is quite simply a struggle between Russia and the
economic forces tending towards a complete collapse of
civilization.
</p>


<p>
The Communists have thus practically the  whole
intelligence of the country to help them in their task of
reconstruction, or of salvage.  But the educated classes alone
cannot save a nation.  Muscle is wanted besides brain, and
the great bulk of those who can provide muscle are difficult
to move to enthusiasm by any broad schemes of economic
rearrangement that do not promise immediate improvement
in their own material conditions.  Industrial conscription
cannot be enforced in Russia unless there is among the
conscripted themselves an understanding, although a
resentful understanding, of its necessity.  The Russians have
not got an army of Martians to enforce effort on an alien
people.  The army and the people are one.  "We are bound
to admit," says Trotsky, "that no wide industrial mobilization
will succeed, if we do not capture all that is honorable,
spiritual in the peasant working masses in explaining our
plan." And the plan that he referred to was not the grandiose
(but obviously sensible) plan for the eventual electrification
of all Russia, but a programme of the struggle before them
in actually getting their feet clear of the morass of industrial
decay in which they are at present involved.  Such a
programme has actually been decided upon-a
programme the definite object of which is to reconcile the
workers to work not simply hand to mouth, each for himself,
but to concentrate first on those labors which will eventually
bring their reward in making other labors easier and
improving the position as a whole.
</p>


<p>
Early this year a comparatively unknown Bolshevik called Gusev,
to whom nobody had attributed any particular
intelligence, wrote, while busy on the staff of an army on the
southeast front, which was at the time being used partly as a
labor army, a pamphlet which has had an extraordinary
influence in getting such a programme drawn up.  The
pamphlet is based on Gusev's personal observation both of a
labor army at work and of the attitude of the peasant
towards industrial conscription.  It was extremely frank, and
contained so much that might have been used by hostile
critics, that it was not published in the ordinary way but
printed at the army press on the Caucasian front and issued
exclusively to members of the Communist Party.  I got hold
of a copy of this pamphlet through a friend. It is called
"Urgent Questions of Economic Construction."Gusev sets
out in detail the sort of opposition he had met, and
says: "The Anarchists, Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks
have a clear, simple economic plan which the great masses
can understand: 'Go about your own business and work
freely for yourself in your own place.'  They have a criticism
of labor mobilizations equally clear for the masses.  They
say to them, 'They are putting Simeon in Peter's place, and
Peter in Simeon's.  They are sending the men of Saratov to
dig the ground in the Government of Stavropol, and the
Stavropol men to the Saratov Government for the same
purpose.'  Then besides that there is 'nonparty' criticism:
</p>

<p>
'When it is time to sow they will be shifting muck, and when
it is time to reap they will be told to cut timber.' That is a
particularly clear expression of the peasants' disbelief in our
ability to draw up a proper economic plan.  This belief is
clearly at the bottom of such questions as, 'Comrade Gusev,
have you ever done any plowing?' or 'Comrade Orator, do
you know anything about peasant work?'  Disbelief in the
townsman who understands nothing about peasants is
natural to the peasant, and we shall have to conquer it, to get
through it, to get rid of it by showing the peasant, with
a clear plan in our hands that he can understand, that we are
not altogether fools in this matter and that we understand
more than he does."  He then sets out the argument which he
himself had found successful in persuading the peasants to
do things the reward for which would not be obvious the
moment they were done.  He says, "I compared our State
economy to a colossal building with scores of stories and
tens of thousands of rooms.  The whole building has been
half smashed; in places the roof has tumbled down, the
beams have rotted, the ceilings are tumbling, the drains and
water pipes are burst; the stoves are falling to pieces, the
partitions are shattered, and, finally, the walls and
foundations are unsafe and the whole building is threatened
with collapse.  I asked, how, must one set about the repair of
this building?  With what kind of economic plan?  To this
question the inhabitants of different stories, and even of
different rooms on one and the same story will reply
variously.  Those who live on the  top floor will shout that
the rafters are rotten and the roof falling; that it is impossible
to live, there any longer, and that it is immediately
necessary, first of all, to put up new beams and to
repair the roof.  And from their point of view they will be
perfectly right.  Certainly it is not possible to live any longer
on that floor.  Certainly the repair of the roof is necessary.
The inhabitants of one of the lower stories in which the
water pipes have burst will cry out that it is impossible to
live without water, and therefore, first of all, the water pipes
must be mended.  And they, from their point of view, will
be perfectly right, since it certainly is impossible to live
without water.  The inhabitants of the floor where the stoves
have fallen to pieces will insist on an immediate mending of
the stoves, since they and their children are dying of cold
because there is nothing on which they can heat up water or
boil kasha for the children; and they, too, will be quite right.
But in spite of all these just demands, which arrive in
thousands from all sides, it is impossible to forget the most
important of all, that the foundation is shattered and that the
building is threatened with a collapse which will bury all the
inhabitants of the house together, and that, therefore, the
only immediate task is the strengthening of the foundation
and the walls. Extraordinary firmness, extraordinary
courage is necessary, not only not to listen to the cries and
groans of old men, women, children and sick, coming from
every floor, but also to decide on taking from the inhabitants
of all floors the instruments and materials necessary for the
strengthening of the foundations and walls, and to force
them to leave their corners and hearths, which they are
doing the best they can to make habitable, in order to drive
them to work on the strengthening of the walls and
foundations."
</p>


<p>
Gusev's main idea was that the Communists were asking
new sacrifices from a weary and exhausted people, that
without such sacrifices these people would presently find
themselves in even worse conditions, and that, to persuade
them to make the effort necessary to save themselves, it was
necessary to have a perfectly clear and easily understandable
plan which could be dinned into the whole nation and
silence the criticism of all possible opponents.  Copies of his
little book came to Moscow.  Lenin read it and caused
excruciating jealousy in the minds of several other
Communists, who had also been trying to find the
philosopher's stone that should turn discouragement
into hope, by singling out Gusev for his special praise and
insisting that his plans should be fully discussed at the
Supreme Council in the Kremlin.  Trotsky followed Lenin's
lead, and in the end a general programme for Russian
reconstruction was drawn up, differing only slightly from
that which Gusev had proposed.  I give this scheme in
Trotsky's words, because they are a little fuller than those of
others, and knowledge of this plan will explain not only
what the Communists are trying to do in Russia, but
what they would like to get from us today and what
they will want to get tomorrow.  Trotsky says:-
</p>



<p class="quote">
"The fundamental task at this moment is improvement in
the condition of our transport, prevention of its further
deterioration and preparation of the most elementary
stores of food, raw material and fuel.  The whole of the first
period of our reconstruction will be completely occupied in
the concentration of labor on the solution of these
problems, which is a condition of further progress.
</p>


<p class="quote">
"The second period (it will be difficult to say now whether it
will be measured in months or years, since that depends on
many factors beginning with the international
situation and ending with the unanimity or the lack of it in
our own party) will be a period occupied in the building of
machines in the interest of transport, and the getting of raw
materials and provisions.
</p>


<p class="quote">
"The third period will be occupied in building machinery,
with a view to the production of articles in general demand,
and, finally, the fourth period will be that in which we are
able to produce these articles."
</p>


<p>
Does it not occur, even to the most casual reader, that there
is very little politics in that program, and that, no matter
what kind of Government should be in Russia, it would have
to endorse that programme word for word?  I would ask any
who doubt this to turn again to my first two chapters
describing the nature of the economic crisis in Russia, and to
remind themselves how, not only the lack of things but the
lack of men, is intimately connected with the lack of
transport, which keeps laborers ill fed, factories ill supplied
with material, and in this way keeps the towns incapable of
supplying the needs of the country, with the result that the
country is most unwilling to supply the needs of the town.
No Russian Government unwilling to allow Russia to
subside definitely to a lower level of civilization can do
otherwise than to concentrate upon the improvement of
transport.  Labor in Russia must be used first of all for that,
in order to increase its own productivity.  And, if purchase
of help from abroad is to be allowed, Russia must "control"
the outflow of her limited assets, so that, by healing
transport first of all, she may increase her power of making
new assets.  She must spend in such a way as eventually
to increase her power of spending.  She must prevent the
frittering away of her small purse on things which, profitable
to the vendor and doubtless desirable by the purchaser,
satisfy only individual needs and do not raise the producing
power of the community as a whole.
