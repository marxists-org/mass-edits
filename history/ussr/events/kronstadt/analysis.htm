<h1>Kronstadt 1921</h1>

<h4>An Analysis of Bolshevik Propaganda</h4>

<p class="quoteb">... Kronstadt was the prototype of later
events which would lead disillusioned radicals to break with the
[Bolshevik] movement and to search for the original purity of their
ideals. The liquidation of the kulaks, the Great Purge, the Nazi-Soviet
pact, Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin&mdash;each produced an
exodus of Party members and supporters who were convinced that the
revolution had been betrayed. "What counts decisively," wrote Louis
Fischer in 1949, "is the Kronstadt. Until its advent, one may waver
emotionally or doubt intellectually or even reject the cause altogether
in one's mind and yet refuse to attack it. I had no such 'Kronstadt'
for many years. (Avrich, p. 3)</p>

<p class="fst">In March 1921, the Russian Revolution died.
The failure of the March Action in Germany crushed hopes for a
"permanent revolution" throughout Europe. The New Economic Policy
(NEP), a partial restoration of capitalism and the market, was
introduced that month. Treaties and trade agreements were signed with
no fewer than five nations&mdash;three of which (Britain, Persia
and Turkey) were battling communist insurgents (for Britain, in its
Asian colonies) who quickly lost their support from Moscow (Carr, p.
47). More than anything else, however, the suppression of the Kronstadt
rebellion served to illustrate the betrayal of the October Revolution
and the degeneration of the Bolsheviks into tyrants. "With the defeat
of Kronstadt ... the last effective demand for a toilers' democracy
passed into history. Thereafter totalitarianism, if not inevitable, was
the likely eventuality" (Avrich, p. 229).</p>

<p class="fst">The sailors of Kronstadt had once been
described by Leon Trotsky as the "pride and glory of the Russian
Revolution." It was a great spiritual blow when the Red Army stormed
the island base after ten days of attacks across the frozen water of
the Baltic. Although the Kronstadt uprising was "a modest affair"
militarily (Avrich, p. 218), it was the greatest propaganda battle the
Bolsheviks had ever entered. Somehow the Bolshevik upper circles had to
convince the world that they were completely justified in crushing the
'pride and glory' of the Revolution they had led. Otherwise, observers
would conclude that the leadership itself had become a
counter-revolutionary force and was bent on the creation of a
totalitarian dictatorship in Russia.</p>

<p class="fst">The first shots of the propaganda war were
fired as soon as the revolt began. Government publications and
announcements declared that Kronstadt had been taken over by White
(Tsarist) forces. The French and other foreigners were also blamed for
the conflict in other official proclamations. These groundless claims
were enough to isolate Kronstadt from potential supporters until the
mutiny was suppressed. After that point, however, the two stories broke
down and new ones had to be invented to justify the Bolsheviks'
actions. In the years following Kronstadt, the Bolsheviks and their
descendants would claim that the mutineers wanted to restore
capitalism, or that they wanted to destroy the Communist Party. They
would claim that the population at Kronstadt had fundamentally changed
and that the new petty-bourgeois sailors were simply throwing a temper
tantrum. They would even claim that the collapse of strikes in
Petrograd during the revolt demonstrated the solidarity of the workers
with the Bolsheviks and against the Kronstadters.</p>

<p class="fst">The truth is that the Kronstadt uprising
was not a threat to Soviet Russia. The mutineers were not
anti-Bolshevik revolutionaries; they were only idealistic reformers
hoping to perfect the results of the October Revolution. None of the
myths used to justify the suppression of Kronstadt are accurate. The
Bolshevik attack on Kronstadt was little more than a drastic
overreaction in the face of a perceived challenge to Bolshevik
authority. It was inspired in large part by the dreadful Civil War,
which had only ended in 1920 and had put Russia and the communists
under a great deal of pressure. Many continue to cling to the old
Bolshevik propaganda about Kronstadt, however, and reject this simple
explanation. The purpose of this work is to present and refute the
claims of the Bolsheviks, in the hope that the true nature of Kronstadt
may eventually be accepted.</p>

<p class="fst">The real leaders of the rebellion are
General Kozlovsky and his aides, Captain Burkser, Kostromitionov,
Shirmanovsky, and other White Guards, who are deceiving you with
promises of democracy and freedom. In actuality, they are fighting for
a restoration of tsarism. (qtd. in Avrich, p. 145)</p>

<p class="fst">One of the 'classic' myths about the
Kronstadt rebellion is that it was led by a White General, with the aim
of restoring the old aristocracy. This was one of the first stories
that the Bolsheviks created to justify smashing Kronstadt, and,
accordingly, it is one of the most easily disproven. The claim that
"The White General Kozlovsky" led and organized the rebellion was
created before there was even any rebellion to speak of, and it was
just as quickly shown to be a lie. Consider the first-hand account of
Victor Serge, a member of the Bolshevik Party who was present in
Petrograd during the revolt:</p>

<p class="quoteb">On the night of [1 March] I was awoken
by the ringing of a telephone in a room at the Astoria next to my own.
An agitated voice told me: 'Kronstadt is in the hands of the Whites. We
are all under orders.'</p>

<p class="quoteb">The man who announced this frightful
news (frightful because it meant the fall of Petrograd at any minute)
was Ilya Ionov, Zinoviev's brother-in-law. "What Whites? Where did they
come from? It's incredible!"</p>

<p class="quoteb">"A general Kozlovsky" ...</p>

<p class="quoteb">... But even before I went to the
District Committee I met comrades, rushing out with their revolvers,
who claimed that it was an atrocious lie: the sailors had mutinied, it
was a naval revolt led by the Soviet... The worst of it all was that we
were paralyzed by official falsehoods. It had never happened before
that our own Party should lie to us like this. "It's necessary for the
benefit of the people," said some, who were nonetheless horror-stricken
at it all. The strike was now almost general. (Serge, p. 124)</p>

<p class="fst">Even before Victor Serge was able to report
to duty, he already knew the official propaganda to be nothing more
than lies. He later reported that Mikhail Kalinin, the President of
Russia, invented the story of Kozlovsky upon his (Kalinin's) return
from the Anchor Square Meeting at the naval base on March 1 (where the
Petropavlovsk Resolution was adopted) (Serge, p. 127).</p>

<p class="fst">While it is true that there was a former
tsarist general at the base, it is clear from all records that this
General Kozlovsky did not have anything to do with leading or guiding
the rebellion. He had been appointed to the base by Leon Trotsky as an
"artillery specialist," a position which he would retain throughout the
revolt. Kozlovsky did give advice to the leaders of the rebellion, such
as they were. He, and the other specialists, recommended an assault on
Oranienbaum, a town on the mainland south of Kronstadt, in order to
seize supplies and prepare for a march on Petrograd. He also argued
that the base's artillery be used to break up the ice which surrounded
the island and free the ice-bound ships so that they could take part in
the battle. He even urged the Provisional Revolutionary Committee to
build barricades in case of a Bolshevik attack (Avrich, p. 138). None
of Kozlovsky's recommendations were pursued by the Kronstadters,
despite the fact that they would all have helped the Kronstadters in
the military struggle.</p>

<p class="fst">This is in part due to the traditional
hatred of officers and the upper classes among the Kronstadt sailors,
another reason why the myth of Kozlovsky's leadership is unbelievable.
"Given the sailors' independent spirit and traditional hatred of
officers, it is unlikely that Kozlovsky and his colleagues could have
won real influence among them" (Avrich, p. 101). These days one must
look long and hard to find any Leninists who still hold that Kozlovsky
led the Kronstadt rebellion; this myth has been abandoned even by those
who created it. Although the story of Kozlovsky's leadership has been
completely discredited, it was once the cornerstone of official
Bolshevik policy. It was the first lie the bureaucrats used to justify
the destruction of the Kronstadt rebellion, so it is fitting that it is
the first to be refuted.</p>

<p class="quoteb">[The Bolsheviks] denounced the men of
Kronstadt as counter-revolutionary mutineers, led by a White general.
This denunciation appears to have been groundless. (Deutscher, p. 511)</p>

<p class="fst">On March 2, Lenin and Trotsky declared the
mutiny to be a plot of "White Guard" generals, behind whom stood the
SR:s and "French Counterintelligence." Later on, Stalin's propaganda
would go further still, claiming that the Kronstadt rising had been
financed by Washington. (Pipes, p. 382)</p>

<p class="fst">The claim that the uprising at Kronstadt
had been arranged by aristocratic &eacute;migr&eacute;s or
hostile foreign nations was another groundless conspiracy theory. It
appeared in the early days of the mutiny, at nearly the same time as
the story about Kozlovsky. Like the first, it is now discredited, but
served for a time to convince a skeptical world of the necessity of
destroying the Kronstadt insurrection as soon as possible. While it is
true that "the Russians is exile rejoiced at the uprising and sought to
assist the insurgents by every possible means ... it is not true that
the &eacute;migr&eacute;s had engineered the rebellion"
(Avrich, p. 126). As a matter of fact, until March 13 the Kronstadters
actually refused to accept the food and medicine (to say nothing of
military aid) that was offered by foreigners (and even the Red Cross),
despite a desperate lack of supplies (Avrich, p. 121). Nothing ever
reached the island.</p>

<p class="fst">As with the rebels' reluctance to heed
Kozlovsky's advice, their refusal to accept aid can be linked to their
hatred of the privileged classes. This is another instance in which the
sailors' pride may have cost them a chance to hold out against the
Bolsheviks' attack, had they been but willing to have anything to do
with "the bourgeoisie." The fact that they let all of these chances
slip away helps to illustrate the true nature of the revolt. The
Kronstadters were in no way agents of the Whites, of the capitalists,
or of the &eacute;migr&eacute;s. Instead, they were simply
workers and soldiers, fed up with the dictatorship that had descended
upon Russia, and eager to reform it.</p>

<p class="fst">Our enemies are trying to deceive you. They
say that the Kronstadt rebellion was organized by Mensheviks, SR:s,
Entente spies, and tsarist generals. Nonsense! If our revolution was
made in Paris, then the moon was made in Berlin. (qtd. in Avrich, p. 98)</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Kronstadt uprising did not attract
the Petrograd workers. It repelled them. The stratification proceeded
along class lines. The workers immediately felt that the Kronstadt
mutineers stood on the opposite side of the barricades&mdash;and
they supported Soviet power. (Trotsky, p. 6)</p>

<p class="fst">After the Kronstadt revolt had already been
crushed, the Bolshevik authorities found themselves haunted by its
memory. Rational observers soon dismissed the charges that the uprising
was arranged by &eacute;migr&eacute;s or White generals, and
the bureaucrats needed new excuses for their actions. These later
justifications were, without exception, far more sophisticated than
those that had been created on the spot. Leon Trotsky in particular
spent a good deal of time arguing the Bolshevik case in attempts to
recruit leftists to his anti-Stalin opposition. One of Trotsky's later
claims tries to show that the workers of Petrograd opposed the revolt,
which was therefore anti-proletarian. He weaves this tale by claiming
that the collapse of the widespread strikes in the city demonstrated
support for the Bolsheviks and opposition to the Kronstadters. A deeper
look shows that this is not necessarily the case.</p>

<p class="fst">Striking throughout the whole of Russia had
grown steadily throughout the winter of 1920-1921, eventually reaching
a climax in February, 1921. The strikes and popular unrest were mainly
inspired by opposition to the policies of "War Communism," which had
been adopted by the Bolsheviks during the Civil War. Many Russians
accepted 'War Communism' as a necessary evil during the Civil War, and
tolerated it in order to defeat the Whites. However, once the Civil War
ended in 1920, opposition to the unnecessary continuation of 'War
Communism' quickly grew. Among its most despised elements were forced
requisitioning of supplies from the countryside, and the "roadblock
detachments," which kept starving urbanites from leaving the cities to
look for food. The "militarization of labor" into armies of workers
controlled with iron discipline and an authoritarian command hierarchy
was another disliked aspect of War Communism.</p>

<p class="fst">In Petrograd, strikes started in January
and grew for the next two months. As Victor Serge noted, when news
about the Kronstadt mutiny reached Petrograd in March, "The strike was
now almost general" (Serge, p. 124). As a matter of fact, the Kronstadt
rebellion actually began as an action in solidarity with the strikes.
On February 26, the battleship Petropavlovsk sent a "Fact-Finding
Mission" to Petrograd to investigate the strikes and the situation in
general. The return and report of this mission on February 28 was the
basis of the Petropavlovsk Resolution, which was adopted the next day
during a mass-meeting in Anchor Square. It is odd, is it not, that the
strikers should be "repelled" by an action taken in solidarity with
them!</p>

<p class="fst">The fact of the matter is that Trotsky's
claim is false, although it is not such a blatant lie as the earlier
myths that had been created about Kozlovsky and the
&eacute;migr&eacute;s. Paul Avrich analyzes the collapse of the
strikes in some detail, and has compiled a list of reasons (unrelated
to solidarity with the Bolsheviks) that prompted this collapse. Among
the most important factors are the armed occupation of Petrograd, mass
arrests of dissidents, skilled propaganda coupled with concessions, and
simple exhaustion on the part of the strikers. "Overnight Petrograd
became an armed camp" (Avrich, p. 46), while at the same time dragnets
of the city by the Cheka (the State's secret security force) rounded up
hundreds of workers and thousands of students, intellectuals, and other
non-workers in just a few days (p. 47). All the strikes were denounced
as counter-revolutionary plots and extra rations were given to the
Petrograd workers. The despised roadblock detachments were removed, and
news of the pending introduction of the NEP was circulated (p. 49).
Above all else, however, "the workers were simply too exhausted to keep
up any sustained political activity... What's more, they lacked
effective leadership and a coherent program of action" (p. 50). For
these reasons, the strikers in Petrograd gave up the struggle only a
few days after the Kronstadters joined them.</p>

<p class="fst">This does not reveal, however, the true
reaction of the Petrograd strikers to the revolt at Kronstadt. Although
the collapse of the strikes had nothing to do with the Kronstadt
rebellion, is it still possible that the strikers really did oppose the
revolt? Historical evidence suggests otherwise. Victor Serge related
how news of Kronstadt brought the strike "to a nearly general
character" (Serge, p. 130) and how "pamphlets distributed in the
working-class districts put out the demands of the Kronstadt Soviet"
(p. 126). Moreover, the revolt inspired additional strikes in other
cities, notably Kazan and Nizhnyi Novgorod (Figes, p. 762). Although
Trotsky's justification is more sophisticated than earlier ones, it is
shown to be just as inaccurate. The claim that the collapse of the
Petrograd strikes showed proletarian opposition to Kronstadt is nothing
more than another attempt to cover up the tyrannical actions of the
Bolsheviks with respect to the Kronstadt revolt.</p>

<p class="quoteb">[Trotsky] accused the masses inside and
outside the Party of sympathizing with Kronstadt. He admitted therefore
that at that time the Petrograd workers and the opposition, although
they had not resisted by force of arms, none the less extended their
sympathy to Kronstadt. (Ciliga, p. 4)</p>

<p class="quoteb">The insurgents did not have a conscious
program and they could not have had one because of the very nature of
the petty bourgeoisie. (Trotsky, p. 6)</p>

<p class="fst">Although they were unable to form links
between the Kronstadt mutineers and well-known counterrevolutionaries,
the Bolsheviks still tried to claim that the revolt deserved to be
crushed due to its very nature. In one article, "Hue and Cry Over
Kronstadt," Leon Trotsky claimed that the Kronstadt revolt had no
conscious program, but was simply a random uprising expressing the
frustrations of the petty-bourgeois peasantry (p. 6). Strangely,
Trotsky forgets to mention the Petropavlovsk Resolution in his analysis
of Kronstadt. This is odd, because this Resolution is generally seen as
an outline of the revolt's program. In full, the Petropavlovsk
Resolution reads:</p>

<p class="fst">Having heard the report of the
representatives sent by the general meeting of ships' crews to
Petrograd to investigate the situation there, we resolve:</p>

<p class="indentb">1. Seeing that the present soviets do
not express the wishes of the workers and peasants, to organize
immediately re-elections to the Soviets with Secret vote, and with care
to allow free electoral propaganda for all workers and peasants.</p>

<p class="indentb">2. To grant liberty of speech and of
press to the workers and peasants, to the anarchists and the left
socialist parties.</p>

<p class="indentb">3. To secure freedom of assembly for
labor unions and peasant organizations.</p>

<p class="indentb">4. To call a non-partisan Conference of
the workers, Red Army Soldiers and sailors of Petrograd, Kronstadt, and
of Petrograd province, no later than March 10th, 1921.</p>

<p class="indentb">5. To liberate all political prisoners
of Socialist parties as well as all workers, peasants, soldiers and
Sailors imprisoned in connection with the labor and peasant movements.</p>

<p class="indentb">6. To elect a Commission to review the
cases of those held in prisons and concentration camps.</p>

<p class="indentb">7. To abolish all 'politodeli'
[official propaganda] because no party should be given special
privileges in the propagation of its ideas or receive financial support
from the government for such purposes. Instead there should be
established educational and cultural commissions, locally elected and
financed by the government.</p>

<p class="indentb">8. To abolish immediately all
'Zagryaditelniye otryadi' [roadblock detachments].</p>

<p class="indentb">9. To equalize the rations of all who
work with the exception of those employed in trades detrimental to
health.</p>

<p class="indentb">10. To abolish the communist fighting
detachments in all branches of the army, as well as the communist
guards kept on duty in mills and factories. Should such guards or
military detachments be found necessary they are to be appointed in the
army from the ranks, and in the factories according to the judgment of
the workers.</p>

<p class="indentb">11. To give the peasants full freedom
of action in regard to their land and also the right to keep cattle on
condition that the peasants manage with their own means; that is,
without employing hired labor.</p>

<p class="indentb">12. To request all branches of the
Army, as well as our comrades the military 'kursanti' [cadets] to
endorse our resolutions.</p>

<p class="indentb">13. To demand that the press give the
fullest publicity to our resolutions.</p>

<p class="indentb">14. To appoint an itinerant bureau of
control.</p>

<p class="indentb">15. To permit free handicraft
production which does not employ hired labor. (Ciliga, p. 2)</p>

<p class="fst">The Petropavlovsk Resolution is clearly a
program, although Trotsky seems to have forgotten about it. While
several of the points deal only with specific grievances, one can find
in the others (notably points 1 through 4) seeds of a free socialist
society. The progressive program of the Kronstadt rebellion did indeed
exist, despite Trotsky's claim. Again, one finds the Bolsheviks
creating their own reality in an effort to justify their inappropriate
actions.</p>

<p class="quoteb">These [demands] are primitive
formulations, insufficient no doubt, but all of them impregnated with
the spirit of October; and no calumny in the world can cast doubt upon
the intimate connection existing between this program and the
sentiments which guided the expropriations of 1917. (Ciliga, p. 3)</p>

<p class="quoteb">That there were actual
counter-revolutionary elements among the sailors was shown by the
slogan "Soviets without Bolsheviks." (Grant, p. 58)</p>

<p class="fst">Unable to brush aside the Kronstadt revolt
as an White &eacute;migr&eacute; conspiracy and forced to admit
that it had a conscious program, modern-day Trotskyists have retreated
to the claim that the revolt was counterrevolutionary and therefore had
to be crushed. Arch-Trotskyist Ted Grant describes how the revolt was
committed to the destruction of the Bolshevik Party, and called for
"Soviets without Bolsheviks" (Grant, p. 58). This is in fact not true:
" 'Soviets without Bolsheviks' was not ... a Kronstadt slogan" (Avrich,
p. 181). A close look at the rebellion shows that the Bolsheviks were
threatened in no way&mdash;the only target was the increasingly
totalitarian nature of the single-Party dictatorship.</p>

<p class="fst">There were, of course, a large number of
Bolshevik Party members at Kronstadt, which had a reputation as a
center of revolutionary activity. At the end of the Civil War, the
Bolshevik Party had over 4,000 members at Kronstadt a large number for
such a small location. However, the end of the Civil War was followed
by "a great wave of defections which reduced party membership from
4,000 to 2,000 between September 1920 and March 1921" (Avrich, p. 183).
Nearly all of the Bolshevik rank and file at the base backed the
uprising when it began in March&mdash;only 300 were arrested (and
by all accounts treated well) by the Kronstadters during the revolt.
While this may seem like a large figure (it was at that point about a
fifth of the total membership), it should be kept in mind that the
Bolsheviks were under orders to sabotage and undermine the rebellion
(Avrich, p. 185). This is all the more impressive when one considers
the fact that the relatives of the Kronstadters in Petrograd had been
taken hostage by the Bolsheviks, who were also executing other soldiers
of questionable loyalty (Avrich, p. 187).</p>

<p class="fst">Also worth noting in any discussion about
the attitude of the mutineers toward the Bolsheviks are the results of
the elections for a new Soviet that occurred a few days into the
revolt. Although this Soviet was now open to all parties (not just the
Bolsheviks, as had been the case), Bolshevik party members made up a
sizable minority&mdash;roughly 30%&mdash;of the delegates
(Avrich, p. 80). This makes it clear that the mutineers did not oppose
the Bolsheviks&mdash;a good number of them were Bolsheviks
themselves! "They were even prepared to accept the Bolsheviks in [the
non-Party Soviets] provided they accepted the principals of Soviet
democracy and renounced their dictatorship" (Figes, p. 761). Nor was
Bolshevik sympathy for the revolt confined to the Kronstadt Party
branch. Several Red Army units that attacked the fortress nearly joined
the rebellion, despite the placement of special security troops (loyal
Bolsheviks with orders to shoot soldiers who wavered) among the ranks
and Cheka machine-guns behind their backs. Even high officials
including "Gorky, ... like many socialists had supported the rebellion
from the start" (Figes, p. 767).</p>

<p class="fst">Even when two senior Bolsheviks traveled to
the base, the rebels showed no signs of aggression or violence. M. I.
Kalinin, the President of the People's Executive, and N. N. Kuzmin, a
commissar of the Baltic Fleet, attended the Anchor Square Meeting where
the Petropavlovsk Resolution was presented to the base.</p>

<p class="quoteb">When [they] arrived, [they] were met by
music, banners, and a military guard of honor, a hopeful sign that
serious trouble might soon be averted. Moreover, the Anchor Square
meeting opened in a friendly spirit, with the Bolshevik chairman of the
Kronstadt Soviet, P. D. Vasiliev, himself presiding. (Avrich, p. 77)</p>

<p class="fst">Things started to go downhill, however,
when the Bolsheviks addressed the crowd of more than 15,000. The
popular Kalinin was heckled by the sailors after he denounced them as
traitors and threatened them with "merciless reprisals;" Kuzmin,
speaking after him, warned that the base's "treason would be smashed by
the iron hand of the proletariat" and was literally booed off the stage
(although both were allowed to leave the fortress peacefully) (Serge,
p. 127). Victor Serge claimed that Kalinin and Kuzmin's "brutal
bungling provoked the rebellion ... [demonstrating that] right from the
first moment, at a time when it was easy to mitigate the conflict, the
Bolshevik leaders had no intention of using anything but forceful
methods" (p. 127).</p>

<p class="fst">The issue of negotiations and a peaceful
resolution to the crisis is a delicate one to the Bolsheviks, since it
contrasts most clearly the belligerence of the Bolsheviks and the
peaceful nature of the revolt. After the Anchor Square debacle, the
Bolsheviks made clear their intention to avoid negotiations by
arresting over 200 delegates from Kronstadt who had been sent to
Petrograd and neighboring areas to explain the position of the
mutineers. The next step was the issue of an ultimatum on 5 March by
Trotsky, who, in words that "could have been issued by a
nineteenth-century provincial governor to the rebellious peasants ...
warned that the rebels would 'be shot like partridges' if they did not
give themselves up in twenty-four hours" (Figes, p. 762). Visiting
American anarchists offered to serve as mediators in the crisis. They
were rebuffed by the Bolshevik leadership and sent on a tour of Russia
by train; Russians who offered to mediate were thrown into jail (Serge,
p. 128). A parley after the first day of the attack was nothing more
than a trap: when members of Kronstadt's Provisional Revolutionary
Committee came out to negotiate, they were taken prisoner by the
Bolsheviks (Avrich, p. 155). No real attempt was made by the Bolsheviks
to resolve the crisis peacefully, although "the chances were good that
the insurgents would have responded to [such an] approach" (Avrich, p.
136).</p>

<p class="fst">The non-aggressive nature of the revolt can
be seen clearly both in the publications of the Kronstadters and in
their actions. The entire Petropavlovsk Resolution was written in a
non-threatening tone&mdash;note Point 12, which asks for
endorsement of the Resolution by other military units. Simply put, the
mutineers had no interest in destroying the Soviet State; they simply
wanted some of its aspects reformed such as the single party
dictatorship and the excesses of 'War Communism'. Their actions matched
their words&mdash;recall that none of the common-sense
recommendations of General Kozlovsky were pursued at all. While many
historians argue that had Kozlovsky's advice been followed the
rebellion might have triumphed, the Kronstadters had no interest in
invading the mainland, freeing the battleships from the ice, or even
erecting barricades in the town (Avrich, p. 219). The revolt was not
founded to attack the Bolsheviks. Rather the rebels naively expected
the rest of Russia to rally to their cause and peacefully create a
truly free Soviet state: "Comrades, the Kronstadters have raised the
banner, and they are confident that tens of millions of workers and
peasants will respond to their call" (qtd. in Avrich, p. 199).</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Kronstadt insurrection had shed not
a single drop of blood, and merely arrested a few Communist officials,
who were treated absolutely correctly; the great majority of Communists
... had rallied to the uprising. (Serge, p. 127)</p>

<p class="fst">Far from representing the interests of the
working class, the Kronstadters were reflecting the pressures of the
peasantry, who were becoming increasingly disaffected... After [the
introduction of the NEP], there were no more Kronstadts... The peasants
had gotten what they wanted. (Grant, p. 59)</p>

<p class="fst">Nowadays, the Bolsheviks also attack the
Kronstadt revolt for being in the interests of capitalism and the
counter-revolution. They claim that the program of the revolt was
inspired by the petty-bourgeois peasants and sought the recreation of
the free market. The fact of the matter is that the Kronstadt's
economic demands (which can be found in the Petropavlovsk Resolution)
are not extreme. The New Economic Policy (NEP) of Lenin and Trotsky
actually went considerably further than the Kronstadt demands towards a
restoration of capitalism (Avrich, p. 74). The NEP had been drawn up
well before the Kronstadt revolt, and was generally seen as a necessary
and proper retreat. One did not find many Bolsheviks accusing Lenin of
counterrevolutionary conspiracy! Unfortunately, the same cannot be said
about Kronstadt.</p>

<p class="fst">The political demands of the Petropavlovsk
Resolution were also the furthest thing from counter-revolutionary as
can be imagined. They tend to echo the promises made by the Bolsheviks
during 1917&mdash;one of the main slogans of the Kronstadt
rebellion was actually a take-off of one of the main slogans of the
October Revolution: "All Power To The Soviets, But Not To Parties!" The
Kronstadt rebellion fought for equality and basic freedoms. It fought
for an end to fear and repression, and for democratic government by
representative Soviets. These goals can clearly be seen in the list of
demands of the Petropavlovsk Resolution, which many modern-day
Leninists seem to have misplaced. The actions of the Kronstadters
during their 18 days of self-rule were also committed to these goals;
the Resolution was not simply literary posturing (Figes, p. 763).</p>

<p class="quoteb">In its ideology, the mutiny was a return
to 1917. (Figes, p. 762)</p>

<p class="quoteb">The first lie is to identify the
Kronstadt mutineers of 1921 with the heroic Red sailors of 1917. They
had nothing in common. The Kronstadt sailors of 1917 were workers and
Bolsheviks. (Grant, p. 56)</p>

<p class="fst">The last resort of the Trotskyists is to
try to claim that the Kronstadters of 1921 were not the Kronstadters of
1917. If this were true, it can be concluded that the Kronstadters
really were counter-revolutionaries, not the "pride and glory of the
Russian Revolution," and therefore deserved to be destroyed.
Unfortunately for the Bolsheviks, it is not true. "[Kronstadt] was in
fact a case of the Bolsheviks being abandoned by their own most favored
sons" (Figes, p. 762). Israel Getzler, in his book <i>Kronstadt
1917-1921: The Fate of a Soviet Democracy</i>, has provided hard
statistics to support these claims. According to his research, over 94%
of the sailors of the battleships Petropavlovsk and the Sevastopol (the
leaders of the mutiny) had been sailors in the Baltic Fleet before
1917. He estimates that 75% of the entire Kronstadt garrison were
veterans from before the October Revolution (qtd. in Figes, p. 762). It
would be superficial to use only these statistics to refute the
Bolshevik claim, of course. An in-depth analysis of this critical issue
is necessary.</p>

<p class="fst">Leon Trotsky claims that all the sailors
and soldiers at Kronstadt in 1917 had been sent off to different fronts
during the desperate years of the Civil War: "The Baltic Fleet and the
Kronstadt garrison were denuded of all revolutionary forces" (p. 3).
This occurred "beginning as early as 1918, and in any case not later
than 1919" (Trotsky, p. 3). While this would seem to make a good deal
of sense, there are a couple of issues that must be kept in mind. First
of all, let us not forget that Kronstadt was "the most important base
in Russia... whoever controlled Kronstadt controlled Petrograd" (Grant,
p. 58). Victor Serge described news of the White occupation of
Kronstadt to be "frightful because it meant the fall of Petrograd at
any minute" (p. 124). It is unlikely that the Bolsheviks would be
shortsighted enough to leave Petrograd open to assault by denuding
Kronstadt of all its revolutionary elements. Additionally, one can
analyze the British assault on Kronstadt near the end of 1919 (after
the time given for the original population to have departed). By all
accounts, the Kronstadters performed admirably in this battle, which
helped to keep Petrograd from falling into the hands of General
Yudenich (Stewart, p. 235). This all demonstrates that Trotsky is at
least exaggerating Kronstadt's loss of personnel during the Civil War,
and is possibly involved in outright falsification.</p>

<p class="fst">Ted Grant claims that "the Kronstadt
garrison of 1921 was composed mainly of raw peasant levies from the
Black Sea region. A cursory glance at the surnames of the mutineers
immediately shows that they were almost all Ukrainians" (p. 56). Very
well&mdash;Mr. Grant's bluff is called. Paul Avrich analyzed
hundreds of surnames of those involved with the rebellion, including
the Provision Revolutionary Committee; these are his results:</p>

<p class="quoteb">So far as one can judge from these
surnames alone&mdash;admittedly an uncertain
procedure&mdash;Great Russians are in the overwhelming majority.
There is no unusual proportion of Ukrainian, Germanic, Baltic, or other
names. Yet the picture is somewhat different when one looks at the
membership of the Provision Revolutionary Committee, the general staff
of the insurrection.</p>

<p class="quoteb">Of the 15 committee members, three
(Petrichenko, Yakovenko, and Romanenko) bore patently Ukrainian names
and two others (Valk and Kilgast) Germanic names. (p. 92)</p>

<p class="fst">The vast majority of the Provisional
Revolutionary Committee is ethnic Russian, and the proportion is even
larger among the rank and file of the rebels! Mr. Grant's statement is
that the Kronstadters of 1917 had all been replaced with raw Ukrainian
peasant levies is obviously incorrect&mdash;there was not really
any population change at all.</p>

<p class="fst">Nor did there need to be a drastic change
in population for the Kronstadters to revolt against the Bolsheviks.
After all, "the seamen [of Kronstadt] were a traditionally unruly
group" (Meijer, p. 848). While in 1917 the extreme radicalism of the
Kronstadt sailors served the Bolsheviks, it worked against them in
1921&mdash;with no fundamental change necessary. Indeed, throughout
the Civil War, there were signs that the Kronstadters only tolerated
the Bolshevik dictatorship because it was seen as the lesser of two
evils:</p>

<p class="fst">Although [the sailors] fought for the Reds
during the defense of Petrograd, in October 1919, they only did so to
defeat the Whites, whom they saw as an even greater evil than the
Bolsheviks. Once the Civil War was over, the sailors turned their anger
on the Reds. (Figes, p. 761)</p>

<p class="fst">In fact, friction had been growing between
the Bolshevik dictatorship and the Kronstadters for years. The first
signs came immediately after the October Revolution, when Lenin created
a cabinet composed completely of Bolsheviks&mdash;against the
wishes of the Kronstadt Soviet (Avrich, p. 62). The actions taken by
the Bolsheviks during the Civil War&mdash;although they were
tolerated by the Kronstadters&mdash;only increased this tension.
Kronstadt had a history of revolutionary maximalism dating back before
the October Revolution, and had always been discontent under Bolshevik
rule (Avrich, p. 65). No change in population was needed to make this
base oppose those it suspected of betraying the revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">The Kronstadt rebels of 1921 were
essentially the same as those of 1917. The majority of their leaders
were veterans of the Kronstadt Fleet... In its personnel, as in its
ideology, the mutiny was a return to the revolutionary days of 1917.
(Figes, p. 762)</p>

<p class="fst">Kronstadt fell in the early morning hours
of March 18, 1921. No mercy was shown to the mutineers, while the
Bolsheviks celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Paris Commune.</p>

<p class="fst">Later that night, some 500 rebels were shot
without trial on Zinoviev's orders: the regular executioner refused to
do it, so a brigade of teenage Komsomols was ordered to shoot the
sailors instead... During the following months 2,000 more rebels were
executed, nearly all of them without trial, while hundreds of others
were sent on Lenin's orders to Solovki, the first big Soviet
concentration camp on an island in the White Sea, where they died a
slower death... About 8,000 rebels escaped across the ice to Finland,
where they were interned and put to public works. Some of them were
later lured back to Russia by the promise of an amnesty&mdash;only
to be shot or sent to concentration camps on their return. (Figes, p.
767)</p>

<p class="fst">The Kronstadt Soviet was disbanded, never
to reform. Absolute power was given to Pavel Dybenko, who was appointed
commander of the fortress by the government. Throughout the rest of the
world, horrified radicals were shattered by the fall of Kronstadt. To
their eyes, "there could not be a more conclusive proof that the
Bolsheviks had turned into tyrants" (Figes, p. 768).</p>

<p class="fst">The political fallout of Kronstadt would
come back to haunt the victors of the day. A secret ban on factions
within the Bolshevik Party, which was prompted by the Kronstadt revolt,
would be used to expel Trotsky from the Party in 1927. In the 1930s,
Trotsky's struggle to create his own opposition to Stalin's Soviet
Union was hindered by "the ghost of Kronstadt, [which] was raised
against him by libertarian socialists who recalled his role in the
crushing of the rebellion" (Avrich, p. 229). To combat this ghost,
Trotsky invented a number of stories which he tried to use to justify
attacking Kronstadt. Among them are the claims that the revolt had no
program, that there had been a fundamental change in the population at
the base, that the rebellion was anti-Bolshevik, and that the rebellion
sought the restoration of capitalism, all of which have been refuted.
"Moreover, as Dwight MacDonald pointed out, Trotsky never answered the
charge that the Bolsheviks handled the revolt with unnecessary
intransigence and brutality" (Avrich, p. 230). In the end, Trotsky
proved unsuccessful in his bid to create a powerful 'Fourth
International,' and Trotskyist parties remain small, sectarian and
disunited to this day.</p>

<p class="fst">From the beginning, the Bolsheviks sought
only to crush Kronstadt. There was no legitimate reason for the
bureaucracy to turn on the base&mdash;the myths of the White
General and &eacute;migr&eacute; plots were invented to justify
the suppression. It is true that a sense of paranoia probably motivated
Bolshevik actions, but this does not excuse them, especially because
new lies were created years after the end of Kronstadt. Even long after
it was clear that the Bolsheviks had been mistaken in their attack on
Kronstadt, they created new stories to justify their actions, instead
of offering the necessary factual analyses.</p>

<p class="fst">Kronstadt was not opposed to Bolshevism;
Kronstadt was not a threat to the Soviet State. It is quite likely that
the "Kronstadt Plan for a Free Russian Government" was the only
possible alternative to the horrors of Stalinism. The end of Kronstadt
was the end of the Russian Revolution, and the justifications offered
by unrepentant Bolsheviks have served only to retard progress and
hinder the development of a truly free world.</p>

dead sometimes speaks louder than the living voice" Emma Goldman (qtd.
