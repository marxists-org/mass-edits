The General Agreement On Tariffs And Trade
</p>

<hr />


<h3>Article XXIV
Territorial Application--Frontier Traffic--Customs Unions
and Free-trade Areas</h3>

<hr />

<p>


1. The provisions of this Agreement shalt apply to the metropolitan
customs territories of the contracting parties and to any other customs
territories in respect of which this Agreement has been accepted under
Article XXVI or is being applied under Article XXXIII or pursuant to the
Protocol of Provisional Application. Each such customs territory shall,
exclusively for the purposes of the territorial application of this
Agreement, be treated as though it were a contracting party; Provided
that the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to create
any rights or obligations as between two or more customs territories in
respect of which this Agreement has been accepted under Article XXVI or
is being applied under Article XXXIII or pursuant to the Protocol of
Provisional Application by a single contracting party.
</p>

<p>
2. For the purposes of this Agreement a customs territory shall be
understood to mean any territory with respect to which separate tariffs
or other regulations of commerce are maintained for a substantial part of
the trade of such territory with other territories.
</p>

<p>
3. The provisions of this Agreement shalt not be construed to prevent:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  Advantages accorded by any contracting party to adjacent countries
      in order to facilitate frontier traffic;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  Advantages accorded to the trade with the Free Territory of Trieste
      by countries contiguous to that territory, provided that such
      advantages are not in conflict with the Treaties of Peace arising
      out of the Second World War.
</p>

<p>
4. The contracting parties recognize the desirability of increasing
freedom of trade by the development, through voluntary agreements, of
closer integration between the economies of the countries parties to such
agreements. They also recognize that the purpose of a customs union or of
a free-trade area should be to facilitate trade between the constituent
territories and not to raise barriers to the trade of other contracting
parties with such territories.
</p>

<p>
5. Accordingly, the provisions of this Agreement shall not prevent, as
between the territories of contracting parties, the formation of a
customs union or of a free-trade area or the adoption of an interim
agreement necessary for the formation of a customs union or of a
free-trade area; Provided that:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  with respect to a customs union, or an interim agreement leading to
      the formation of a customs union, the duties and other regulations
      of commerce imposed at the institution of any such union or interim
      agreement in respect of trade with contracting parties not parties
      to such union or agreement shall not on the whole be higher or more
      restrictive than the general incidence of the duties and
      regulations of commerce applicable in the constituent territories
      prior to the formation of such union or the adoption of such
      interim agreement, as the case may be;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  with respect to a free-trade area, or an interim agreement leading
      to the formation of a free-trade area, the duties and other
      regulations of commerce maintained in each of the constituent
      territories and applicable at the formation of such free-trade area
      or the adoption of such interim agreement to the trade of
      contracting parties not included in such area or not parties to
      such agreement shall not be higher or more restrictive than the
      corresponding duties and other regulations of commerce existing in
      the same constituent territories prior to the formation of the
      free-trade area, or interim agreement, as the case may be; and
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (c)  any interim agreement referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b)
      shall include a plan and schedule for the formation of such a
      customs union or of such a free-trade area within a reasonable
      length of time.
</p>

<p>
6. If, in fulfilling the requirements of sub-paragraph 5 (a), a
contracting party proposes to increase any rate of duty inconsistently
with the provisions of Article II, the procedure set forth in Article
XXVIII shall apply. In providing for compensatory adjustment, due account
shall be taken of the compensation already afforded by the reductions
brought about in the corresponding duty of the other constituents of the
union.
</p>

<p>
7.</p>
<p class="indentb"> (a) Any contracting party deciding to enter into a customs union or
free-trade area, or an interim agreement leading to the formation of such
a union or area, shall promptly notify the CONTRACTING PARTIES and shall
make available to them such information regarding the proposed union or
area as will enable them to make such reports and recommendations to
contracting parties as they may deem appropriate.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
    (b) If, after having studied the plan and schedule included in an
interim agreement referred to in paragraph 5 in consultation with the
parties to that agreement and taking due account of the information made
available in accordance with the provisions of sub-paragraph (a), the
CONTRACTING PARTIES find that such agreement is not likely to result in
the formation of a customs union or of a free-trade area within the
period contemplated by the parties to the agreement or that such period
is not a reasonable one, the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall make
recommendations to the parties to the agreement. The parties shall not
maintain or put into force, as the case may be, such agreement if they
are not prepared to modify it in accordance with these recommendations.
</p>

<p>
    (c) Any substantial change in the plan or schedule referred to in
paragraph 5 (c) shall be communicated to the CONTRACTING PARTIES, which
may request the contracting parties concerned to consult with them if the
change seems likely to jeopardize or delay unduly the formation of the
customs union or of the free-trade area.
</p>

<p>
8. For the purposes of this Agreement:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  A customs union shall be understood to mean the substitution of a
      single customs territory for two or more customs territories, so
      that
</p>

<p class="indentc">
 (i)   duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce (except,
            where necessary, those permitted under Articles XI, XII,
            XIII, XIV, XV and XX) are eliminated with respect to
            substantially all the trade between the constituent
            territories of the union or at least with respect to
            substantially all the trade in products originating in such
            territories, and,
</p>

<p class="indentc">
 (ii)  subject to the provisions of paragraph 9, substantially the
            same duties and other regulations of commerce are applied by
            each of the members of the union to the trade of territories
            not included in the union;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  A free-trade area shall be understood to mean a group of two or
      more customs territories in which the duties and other restrictive
      regulations of commerce (except, where necessary, those permitted
      under Articles XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV and XX) are eliminated on
      substantially all the trade between the constituent territories in
      products originating in such territories.
</p>

<p>
9. The preferences referred to in paragraph 2 of Article I shall not be
affected by the formation of a customs union or of a free-trade area but
may be eliminated or adjusted by means of negotiations with contracting
parties affected. This procedure of negotiations with affected
contracting parties shall, in particular, apply to the elimination of
preferences required to conform with the provisions of paragraph 8 (a)
(i) and paragraph 8 (b).
</p>

<p>
10. The CONTRACTING PARTIES may by a two-thirds majority approve
proposals which do not fully comply with the requirements of paragraphs 5
to 9 inclusive, provided that such proposals lead to the formation of a
customs union or a free-trade area in the sense of this Article.
</p>

<p>
11. Taking into account the exceptional circumstances arising out of the
establishment of India and Pakistan as independent States and recognizing
the fact that they have long constituted an economic unit, the
contracting parties agree that the provisions of this Agreement shall not
prevent the two countries from entering into special arrangements with
respect to the trade between them, pending the establishment of their
mutual trade relations on a definitive basis.
</p>

<p>
12. Each contracting party shall take such reasonable measures as may be
available to it to ensure observance of the provisions of this Agreement
by the regional and local governments and authorities within its
territory.
