The General Agreement On Tariffs And Trade
</p>

<hr />


<h3>Article XXXVI
Principles and Objectives</h3>

<hr />

<p>
1. The contracting parties,
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  recalling that the basic objectives of this Agreement include the
      raising of standards of living and the progressive development of
      the economies of all contracting parties, and considering that the
      attainment of these objectives is particularly urgent for less-
      developed contracting parties;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  considering that export earnings of the less-developed contracting
      parties can play a vital part in their economic development and
      that the extent of this contribution depends on the prices paid by
      the less-developed contracting parties for essential imports, the
      volume of their exports, and the prices received for these exports;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (c)  noting, that there is a wide gap between standards of living in
      less-developed countries and in other countries;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (d)  recognizing that individual and joint action is essential to
      further the development of the economies of less-developed
      contracting parties and to bring about a rapid advance in the
      standards of living in these countries;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (e)  recognizing that international trade as a means of achieving
      economic and social advancement should be governed by such rules
      and procedures--and measures in conformity with such rules and
      procedures--as are consistent with the objectives set forth in this
      Article;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (f)  noting that the CONTRACTING PARTIES may enable less-developed
      contracting parties to use special measures to promote their trade
      and development;
</p>

<p>
agree as follows.
</p>

<p>
2. There is need for a rapid and sustained expansion of the export
earnings of the less-developed contracting parties.
</p>

<p>
3. There is need for positive efforts designed to ensure that less-
developed contracting parties secure a share in the growth in
international trade commensurate with the needs of their economic
development.
</p>

<p>
4. Given the continued dependence of many less-developed contracting
parties on the exportation of a limited range of primary products, there
is need to provide in the largest possible measure more favourable and
acceptable conditions of access to world markets for these products, and
wherever appropriate to devise measures designed to stabilize and improve
conditions of world markets in these products, including in particular
measures designed to attain stable, equitable and remunerative prices,
thus permitting an expansion of world trade and demand and a dynamic and
steady growth of the real export earnings of these countries so as to
provide them with expanding resources for their economic development.
</p>

<p>
5. The rapid expansion of the economies of the less-developed contracting
parties will be facilitated by a diversification of the structure of
their economies and the avoidance of an excessive dependence on the
export of primary products. There is, therefore, need for increased
access in the largest possible measure to markets under favourable
conditions for processed and manufactured products currently or
potentially of particular export interest to less-developed contracting
parties.
</p>

<p>
6. Because of the chronic deficiency in the export proceeds and other
foreign exchange earnings of less-developed contracting parties, there
are important inter-relationships between trade and financial assistance
to development. There is, therefore, need for close and continuing
collaboration between the CONTRACTING PARTIES and the international
lending agencies so that they can contribute most effectively to
alleviating the burdens these less-developed contracting parties assume
in the interest of their economic development.
</p>

<p>
7. There is need for appropriate collaboration between the CONTRACTING
PARTIES, other intergovernmental bodies and the organs and agencies of
the United Nations system, whose activities relate to the trade and
economic development of less-developed countries.
</p>

<p>
8. The developed contracting parties do not expect reciprocity for
commitments made by them in trade negotiations to reduce or remove
tariffs and other barriers to the trade of less-developed contracting
parties.
9. The adoption of measures to give effect to these principles and
objectives shall be a matter of conscious and purposeful effort on the
part of the contracting parties both individually and jointly.
