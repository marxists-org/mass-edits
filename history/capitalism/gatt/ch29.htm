The General Agreement On Tariffs And Trade
</p>

<hr />


<h3>Article XXIX
The Relation of this Agreement to the Havana Charter</h3>

<hr />

<p>


1. The contracting parties undertake to observe to the fullest extent of
their executive authority the general principles of Chapters I to VI
inclusive and of Chapter IX of the Havana Charter pending their
acceptance of it in accordance with their constitutional procedures.
</p>

<p>
2. Part II of this Agreement shall be suspended on the day on which the
Havana Charter enters into force.
</p>

<p>
3. If by September 30, 1949, the Havana Charter has not entered into
force, the contracting parties shall meet before December 31, 1949, to
agree whether this Agreement shall be amended, supplemented or
maintained.
</p>

<p>
4. If at any time the Havana Charter should cease to be in force, the
CONTRACTING PARTIES shall meet as soon as practicable thereafter to agree
whether this Agreement shall be supplemented, amended or maintained.
Pending such agreement, Part II of this Agreement shall again enter into
force; Provided that the provisions of Part II other than Article XXIII
shall be replaced, mutatis mutandis, in the form in which they then
appeared in the Havana Charter; and Provided further that no contracting
party shall be bound by any provisions which did not bind it at the time
when the Havana Charter ceased to be in force.
</p>

<p>
5. If any contracting party has not accepted the Havana Charter by the
date upon which it enters into force, the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall
confer to agree whether, and if so in what way, this Agreement in so far
as it affects relations between such contracting party and other
contracting parties, shall be supplemented or amended. Pending such
agreement the provisions of Part Il of this Agreement shall,
notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, continue
to apply as between such contracting party and other contracting parties.
</p>

<p>
6. Contracting parties which are Members of the International Trade
Organization shall not invoke the provisions of this Agreement so as to
prevent the operation of any provision of the Havana Charter. The
application of the principle underlying this paragraph to any contracting
party which is not a Member of the International Trade Organization shall
be the subject of an agreement pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article.
