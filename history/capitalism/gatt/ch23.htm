<h3>Article XXIII
Nullification or Impairment</h3>

<hr />

<p>


1. If any contracting party should consider that any benefit accruing to
it directly or indirectly under this Agreement is being nullified or
impaired or that the attainment of any objective of the Agreement is
being impeded as the result of
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  the failure of another contracting party to carry out its
      obligations under this Agreement, or
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  the application by another contracting party of any measure,
      whether or not it conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement,
      or
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (c)  the existence of any other situation, the contracting party may, with a view to the satisfactory adjustment of
the matter, make written representations or proposals to the other
contracting party or parties which it considers to be concerned. Any
contracting party thus approached shall give sympathetic consideration to
the representations or proposals made to it.
</p>

<p>
2. If no satisfactory adjustment is effected between the contracting
parties concerned within a reasonable time, or if the difficulty is of
the type described in paragraph 1(c) of this Article, the matter may be
referred to the CONTRACTING PARTIES. The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall
promptly investigate any matter so referred to them and shalt make
appropriate recommendations to the contracting parties which they
consider to be concerned, or give a ruling on the matter, as appropriate.
The CONTRACTING PARTIES may consult with contracting parties, with the
Economic and Social Council of the United Nations and with any
appropriate inter-governmental organization in cases where they consider
such consultation necessary. If the CONTRACTING PARTIES consider that the
circumstances are serious enough to justify such action, they may
authorize a contracting party or parties to suspend the application to
any other contracting party or parties of such concessions or other
obligations under this Agreement as they determine to be appropriate in
the circumstances. If the application to any contracting party of any
concession or other obligation is in fact suspended, that contracting
party shall then be free, not later than sixty days after such action is
taken, to give written notice to the Executive Secretary to the
CONTRACTING PARTIES of its intention to withdraw from this Agreement and
such withdrawal shall take effect upon the sixtieth day following the day
on which such notice is received by him.
