<h3>Article IV
Special Provisions relating to Cinematograph Films</h3>

<hr />

<p>


If any contracting party establishes or maintains internal quantitative
regulations relating to exposed cinematograph films, such regulations
shall take the form of screen quotas which shall conform to the following
requirements:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  Screen quotas may require the exhibition of cinematograph films of
      national origin during a specified minimum proportion of the total
      screen time actually utilized, over a specified period of not less
      than one year, in the commercial exhibition of all films of
      whatever origin, and shall be computed on the basis of screen time
      per theatre per year or the equivalent thereof;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  With the exception of screen time reserved for films of national
      origin under a screen quota, screen time including that released by
      administrative action from screen time reserved for films of
      national origin, shall not be allocated formally or in effect among
      sources of supply;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (b) of this
      Article, any contracting party may maintain screen quotas
      conforming to the requirements of sub-paragraph (a) of this Article
      which reserve a minimum proportion of screen time for films of a
      specified origin other than that of the contracting party imposing
      such screen quotas; Provided that no such minimum proportion of
      screen time shall be increased above the level in effect on April
      10, 1947;
</p>
<p class="indentb">
 (d)  Screen quotas shall be subject to negotiation for their limitation,
      liberalization or elimination.
