<h3>Article VI
Anti-dumping and Countervailing Duties</h3>

<hr />

<p>


1. The contracting parties recognize that dumping, by which products of
one country are introduced into the commerce of another country at less
than the normal value of the products, is to be condemned if it causes or
threatens material injury to an established industry in the territory of
a contracting party or materially retards the establishment of a domestic
industry. For the purposes of this Article, a product is to be considered
as being introduced into the commerce of an importing country at less
than its normal value, if the price of the product exported from one
country to another
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade,
      for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting
      country, or,
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  in the absence of such domestic price, is less than either
</p>

<p class="indentc">
      (i)   the highest comparable price for the like product for export
            to any third country in the ordinary course of trade, or
</p>

<p class="indentc">
      (ii)  the cost of production of the product in the country of
            origin plus a reasonable addition for selling cost and
            profit.
</p>

<p>
Due allowance shall be made in each case for differences in conditions
and terms of sale, for differences in taxation, and for other differences
affecting price comparability.
</p>

<p>
2. In order to offset or prevent dumping, a contracting party may levy on
any dumped product an anti-dumping duty not greater in amount than the
margin of dumping in respect of such product. For the purposes of this
Article, the margin of dumping is the price difference determined in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1.
</p>

<p>
3. No countervailing duty shall be levied on any product of the territory
of any contracting party imported into the territory of another
contracting party in excess of an amount equal to the estimated bounty or
subsidy determined to have been granted, directly or indirectly, on the
manufacture, production or export of such product in the country of
origin or exportation, including any special subsidy to the
transportation of a particular product. The term "countervailing duty"
shall be understood to mean a special duty levied for the purpose of
offsetting any bounty or subsidy bestowed, directly or indirectly, upon
the manufacture, production or export of any merchandise.
</p>

<p>
4. No product of the territory of any contracting party imported into the
territory of any other contracting party shall be subject to anti-dumping
or countervailing duty by reason of the exemption of such product from
duties or taxes borne by the like product when destined for consumption
in the country of origin or exportation, or by reason of the refund of
such duties or taxes.
</p>

<p>
5. No product of the territory of any contracting party imported into the
territory of any other contracting party shall be subject to both anti-
dumping and countervailing duties to compensate for the same situation of
dumping or export subsidization.
</p>

<p>
6. </p><p class="indentb">(a) No contracting party shall levy any anti-dumping or countervailing
duty on the importation of any product of the territory of another
contracting party unless it determines that the effect of the dumping or
subsidization, as the case may be, is such as to cause or threaten
material injury to an established domestic industry, or is such as to
retard materially the establishment of a domestic industry.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (b) The CONTRACTING PARTIES may waive the requirement of subparagraph
(a) of this paragraph so as to permit a contracting party to levy an
anti-dumping or countervailing duty on the importation of any product for
the purpose of offsetting dumping or subsidization which causes or
threatens material injury to an industry in the territory of another
contracting party exporting the product concerned to the territory of the
importing contracting party. The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall waive the
requirements of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, so as to permit the
levying of a countervailing duty, in cases in which they find that a
subsidy is causing or threatening material injury to an industry in the
territory of another contracting party exporting the product concerned to
the territory of the importing contracting party.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (c) In exceptional circumstances, however, where delay might cause
damage which would be difficult to repair, a contracting party may levy a
countervailing duty for the purpose referred to in sub-paragraph (b) of
this paragraph without the prior approval of the CONTRACTING PARTIES;
Provided that such action shall be reported immediately to the
CONTRACTING PARTIES and that the countervailing duty shall be withdrawn
promptly if the CONTRACTING PARTIES disapprove.
</p>

<p>
7. A system for the stabilization of the domestic price or of the return
to domestic producers of a primary commodity, independently of the
movements of export prices, which results at times in the sale of the
commodity for export at a price lower than the comparable price charged
for the like commodity to buyers in the domestic market, shall be
presumed not to result in material injury within the meaning of paragraph
6 if it is determined by consultation among the contracting parties
substantially interested in the commodity concerned that:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  the system has also resulted in the sale of the commodity for
      export at a price higher than the comparable price charged for the
      like commodity to buyers in the domestic market, and
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  the system is so operated, either because of the effective
      regulation of production, or otherwise, as not to stimulate exports
      unduly or otherwise seriously prejudice the interests of other
      contracting parties.
