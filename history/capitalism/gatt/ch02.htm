The General Agreement On Tariffs And Trade
</p>

<hr />


<h3>Article II: 
Schedules of Concessions</h3>

<hr />

<p>
1. 
</p>
<p class="indentb">
(a) Each contracting party shall accord to the commerce of the other
contracting parties treatment no less favourable than that provided for
in the appropriate Part of the appropriate Schedule annexed to this
Agreement.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (b) The products described in Part I of the Schedule relating to any
contracting party, which are the products of territories of other
contracting parties, shall, on their importation into the territory to
which the Schedule relates, and subject to the terms, conditions or
qualifications set forth in that Schedule, be exempt from ordinary
customs duties in excess of those set forth and provided for therein.
Such products shall also be exempt from all other duties or charges of
any kind imposed on or in connection with importation in excess of those
imposed on the date of this Agreement or those directly and mandatorily
required to be imposed thereafter by legislation in force in the
importing territory on that date.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (c) The products described in Part II of the Schedule relating to any
contracting party which are the products of territories entitled under
Article I to receive preferential treatment upon importation into the
territory to which the Schedule relates shall, on their importation into
such territory, and subject to the terms, conditions or qualifications
set forth in that Schedule, be exempt from ordinary customs duties in
excess of those set forth and provided for in Part II of that Schedule.
Such products shall also be exempt from all other duties or charges of
any kind imposed on or in connection with importation in excess of those
imposed on the date of this Agreement or those directly and mandatorily
required to be imposed thereafter by legislation in force in the
importing territory on that date. Nothing in this Article shall prevent
any contracting party from maintaining its requirements existing on the
date of this Agreement as to the eligibility of goods for entry at
preferential rates of duty.
</p>

<p>
2. Nothing in this Article shall prevent any contracting party from
imposing at any time on the importation of any product:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  a charge equivalent to an internal tax imposed consistently with
      the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article III in respect of the like
      domestic product or in respect of an article from which the
      imported product has been manufactured or produced in whole or in
      part;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  any anti-dumping or countervailing duty applied consistently with
      the provisions of Article VI;
</p>
<p class="indentb">
 (c)  fees or other charges commensurate with the cost of services
      rendered.
</p>

<p>
3. No contracting party shall alter its method of determining dutiable
value or of converting currencies so as to impair the value of any of the
concessions provided for in the appropriate Schedule annexed to this
Agreement.
</p>

<p>
4. If any contracting party establishes, maintains or authorizes,
formally or in effect, a monopoly of the importation of any product
described in the appropriate Schedule annexed to this Agreement, such
monopoly shall not, except as provided for in that Schedule or as
otherwise agreed between the parties which initially negotiated the
concession, operate so as to afford protection on the average in excess
of the amount of protection provided for in that Schedule. The provisions
of this paragraph shall not limit the use by contracting parties of any
form of assistance to domestic producers permitted by other provisions of
this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
5. If any contracting party considers that a product is not receiving
from another contracting party the treatment which the first contracting
party believes to have been contemplated by a concession provided for in
the appropriate Schedule annexed to this Agreement, it shall bring the
matter directly to the attention of the other contracting party. If the
latter agrees that the treatment contemplated was that claimed by the
first contracting party, but declares that such treatment cannot be
accorded because a court or other proper authority has ruled to the
effect that the product involved cannot be classified under the tariff
laws of such contracting party so as to permit the treatment contemplated
in this Agreement, the two contracting parties, together with any other
contracting parties substantially interested, shall enter promptly into
further negotiations with a view to a compensatory adjustment of the
matter.
</p>

<p>
6. </p><p class="indentb">(a) The specific duties and charges included in the Schedules relating
to contracting parties members of the International Monetary Fund, and
margins of preference in specific duties and charges maintained by such
contracting parties, are expressed in the appropriate currency at the par
value accepted or provisionally recognized by the Fund at the date of
this Agreement. Accordingly, in case this par value is reduced
consistently with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary
Fund by more than twenty per centum, such specific duties and charges and
margins of preference may be adjusted to take account of such reduction;
Provided that the CONTRACTING PARTIES (i.e., the contracting parties
acting jointly as provided for in Article XXV) concur that such
adjustments will not impair the value of the concessions provided for in
the appropriate Schedule or elsewhere in this Agreement, due account
being taken of all factors which may influence the need for, or urgency
of, such adjustments.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (b) Similar provisions shall apply to any contracting party not a
member of the Fund, as from the date on which such contracting party
becomes a member of the Fund or enters into a special exchange agreement
in pursuance of Article XV.
</p>

<p>
7. The Schedules annexed to this Agreement are hereby made an integral
part of Part I of this Agreement.
