<h3>Article I: General Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment</h3>

<hr />

<p>


1. With respect to customs duties and charges of any kind imposed on or
in connection with importation or exportation or imposed on the
international transfer of payments for imports or exports, and with
respect to the method of levying such duties and charges, and with
respect to all rules and formalities in connection with importation and
exportation, and with respect to all matters referred to in paragraphs 2
and 4 of Article III, any advantage, favour, privilege or immunity
granted by any contracting party to any product originating in or
destined for any other country shall be accorded immediately and
unconditionally to the like product originating in or destined for the
territories of all other contracting parties.
</p>

<p>
2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not require the
elimination of any preferences in respect of import duties or charges
which do not exceed the levels provided for in paragraph 4 of this
Article and which fall within the following descriptions:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  Preferences in force exclusively between two or more of the
      territories listed in Annex A, subject to the conditions set forth
      therein;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  Preferences in force exclusively between two or more territories
      which on July 1, 1939, were connected by common sovereignty or
      relations of protection or suzerainty and which are listed in
      Annexes B, C and D, subject to the conditions set forth therein;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (c)  Preferences in force exclusively between the United States of
      America and the Republic of Cuba;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (d)  Preferences in force exclusively between neighbouring countries
      listed in Annexes E and F.
</p>

<p>
3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to preferences between
the countries formerly a part of the Ottoman Empire and detached from it
on July 24, 1923, provided such preferences are approved under paragraph
5 of Article XXV, which shall be applied in this respect in the light of
paragraph 1 of Article XXIX.
</p>

<p>
4. The margin of preference on any product in respect of which a
preference is permitted under paragraph 2 of this Article but is not
specifically set forth as a maximum margin of preference in the
appropriate Schedule annexed to this Agreement shall not exceed:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  in respect of duties or charges on any product described in such
      Schedule, the difference between the most-favoured-nation and
      preferential rates provided for therein; if no preferential rate is
      provided for, the preferential rate shall for the purposes of this
      paragraph be taken to be that in force on April 10, 1947, and, if
      no most-favoured-nation rate is provided for, the margin shall not
      exceed the difference between the most-favoured-nation and
      preferential rates existing on April 10, 1947;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  in respect of duties or charges on any product not described in the
      appropriate Schedule, the difference between the most-favoured
      nation and preferential rates existing on April 10, 1947.
