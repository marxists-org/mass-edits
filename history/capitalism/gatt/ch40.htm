The General Agreement On Tariffs And Trade
</p>

<hr />


<h3>                              ANNEX I (                NOTES AND SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS)</h3>

<hr />

<p class="skip">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
                           Ad Article I
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 1
</p>

<p>
The obligations incorporated in paragraph 1 of Article I by reference to
paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article In and those incorporated in paragraph 2
(b) of Article II by reference to Article VI shall be considered as
falling within Part II for the purposes of the Protocol of Provisional
Application.
</p>

<p>
The cross-references, in the paragraph immediately above and in paragraph
1 of Article I, to paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article III shall only apply
after Article III has been modified by the entry into force of the
amendment provided for in the Protocol Modifying Part II and Article XXVI
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dated September 14, 1948.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 4
</p>

<p>
The term " margin of preference " means the absolute difference between
the most-favoured-nation rate of duty and the preferential rate of duty
for the like product, and not the proportionate relation between those
rates. As examples:
</p>

<p>
 (1)  If the most-favoured-nation rate were 36 per cent ad valorem and
      the preferential rate were 24 per cent ad valorem, the margin of
      preference would be 12 per cent ad valorem, and not one-third of
      the most-favoured-nation rate;
</p>

<p>
 (2)  If the most-favoured-nation rate were 36 per cent ad valorem and
      the preferential rate were expressed as two-thirds of the
      most-favoured-nation rate, the margin of preference would be 12 per
      cent ad valorem;
</p>

<p>
 (3)  If the most-favoured-nation rate were 2 francs per kilogramme and
      the preferential rate were 1.50 francs per kilogramme, the margin
      of preference would be 0.50 franc per kilogramme.
</p>

<p>
The following kinds of customs action, taken in accordance with
established uniform procedures, would not be contrary to a general
binding of margins of preference:
</p>

<p>
 (i)  The re-application to an imported product of a tariff
      classification or rate of duty, properly applicable to such
      product, in cases in which the application of such classification
      or rate to such product was temporarily suspended or inoperative on
      April 10, 1947; and
</p>

<p class="indentc">
 (ii) The classification of a particular product under a tariff item
      other than that under which importations of that product were
      classified on April 10, 1947, in cases in which the tariff law
      clearly contemplates that such product may be classified under more
      than one tariff item.
</p>

<p>
                             Ad Article II
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 2 (a)
</p>

<p>
The cross-reference, in paragraph 2(a) of Article II, to paragraph 2 of
Article III shall only apply after Article III has been modified by the
entry into force of the amendment provided for in the Protocol Modifying
Part II and Article XXVI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
dated September 14, 1948.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 2 (b)
</p>

<p>
See the note relating to paragraph 1 of Article I.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 4
</p>

<p>
Except where otherwise specifically agreed between the contracting
parties which initially negotiated the concession, the provisions of this
paragraph will be applied in the light of the provisions of Article 31 of
the Havana Charter.
</p>

<p>
                           Ad Article III
</p>

<p>
Any internal tax or other internal charge, or any law, regulation or
requirement of the kind referred to in paragraph 1 which applies to an
imported product and to the like domestic product and is collected or
enforced in the case of the imported product at the time or point of
importation, is nevertheless to be regarded as an internal tax or other
internal charge, or a law, regulation or requirement of the kind referred
to in paragraph 1, and is accordingly subject to the provisions of
Article III.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 1
</p>

<p>
The application of paragraph 1 to internal taxes imposed by local
governments and authorities within the territory of a contracting party
is subject to the provisions of the final paragraph of Article XXIV. The
term " reasonable measures " in the last-mentioned paragraph would not
require, for example, the repeal of existing national legislation
authorizing local governments to impose internal taxes which, although
technically inconsistent with the letter of Article III, are not in fact
inconsistent with its spirit, if such repeal would result in a serious
financial hardship for the local governments or authorities concerned.
With regard to taxation by local governments or authorities which is
inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of Article III, the term "
reasonable measures " would permit a contracting party to eliminate the
inconsistent taxation gradually over a transition period, if abrupt
action would create serious administrative and financial difficulties.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 2
</p>

<p>
A tax conforming to the requirements of the first sentence of paragraph 2
would be considered to be inconsistent with the provisions of the second
sentence only in cases where competition was involved between, on the one
hand, the taxed product and, on the other hand, a directly competitive or
substitutable product which was not similarly taxed.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 5
</p>

<p>
Regulations consistent with the provisions of the first sentence of
paragraph 5 shall not be considered to be contrary to the provisions of
the second sentence in any case in which all of the products subject to
the regulations are produced domestically in substantial quantities. A
regulation cannot be justified as being consistent with the provisions of
the second sentence on the ground that the proportion or amount allocated
to each of the products which are the subject of the regulation
constitutes an equitable relationship between imported and domestic
products.
</p>

<p>
                            Ad Article V
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 5
</p>

<p>
With regard to transportation charges, the principle laid down in
paragraph 5 refers to like products being transported on the same route
under like conditions.
</p>

<p>
                            Ad Article VI
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 1
</p>

<p>
1. Hidden dumping by associated houses (that is, the sale by an importer
at a price below that corresponding to the price invoiced by an exporter
with whom the importer is associated, and also below the price in the
exporting country) constitutes a form of price dumping with respect to
which the margin of dumping may be calculated on the basis of the price
at which the goods are resold by the importer.
</p>

<p>
2. It is recognized that, in the case of imports from a country which has
a complete or substantially complete monopoly of its trade and where all
domestic prices are fixed by the State, special difficulties may exist in
determining price comparability for the purposes of paragraph 1, and in
such cases importing contracting parties may find it necessary to take
into account the possibility that a strict comparison with domestic
prices in such a country may not always be appropriate.
</p>

<p>
Paragraphs 2 and 3
</p>

<p>
1. As in many other cases in customs administration, a contracting party
may require reasonable security (bond or cash deposit) for the payment of
anti-dumping or countervailing duty pending final determination of the
facts in any case of suspected dumping or subsidization.
</p>

<p>
2. Multiple currency practices can in certain circumstances constitute a
subsidy to exports which may be met by countervailing duties under
paragraph 3 or can constitute a form of dumping by means of a partial
depreciation of a country's currency which may be met by action under
paragraph 2. By " multiple currency practices " is meant practices by
governments or sanctioned by governments.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 6 (b)
</p>

<p>
Waivers under the provisions of this sub-paragraph shall be granted only
on application by the contracting party proposing to levy an anti-dumping
or countervailing duty, as the case may be.
</p>

<p>
                            Ad Article VII
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 1
</p>

<p>
The expression "or other charges" is not to be regarded as including
internal taxes or equivalent charges imposed on or in connexion with
imported products.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 2
</p>

<p>
1. It would be in conformity with Article VII to presume that "actual
value" may be represented by the invoice price, plus any non-included
charges for legitimate costs which are proper elements of "actual value"
and plus any abnormal discount or other reduction from the ordinary
competitive price.
</p>

<p>
2. It would be in conformity with Article VII, paragraph 2 (b), for a
contracting party to construe the phrase "in the ordinary course of trade
. . . under fully competitive conditions", as excluding any transaction
wherein the buyer and seller are not independent of each other and price
is not the sole consideration.
</p>

<p>
3. The standard of "fully competitive conditions" permits a contracting
party to exclude from consideration prices involving special discounts
limited to exclusive agents.
</p>

<p>
4. The wording of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) permits a contracting party
to determine the value for customs purposes uniformly either (1) on the
basis of a particular exporter's prices of the imported merchandise, or
(2) on the basis of the general price level of like merchandise.
</p>

<p>
                           Ad Article VIII
</p>

<p>
1. While Article VIII does not cover the use of multiple rates of
exchange as such, paragraphs 1 and 4 condemn the use of exchange taxes or
fees as a device for implementing multiple currency practices; if,
however, a contracting party is using multiple currency exchange fees for
balance of payments reasons with the approval of the International
Monetary Fund, the provisions of paragraph 9 (a) of Article XV fully
safeguard its position.
</p>

<p>
2. It would be consistent with paragraph 1 if, on the importation of
products from the territory of a contracting party into the territory of
another contracting party, the production of certificates of origin
should only be required to the extent that is strictly indispensable.
</p>

<p>
               Ad Articles XI, XII, XIII, XIV and XVIII
</p>

<p>
Throughout Articles XI, XII, XIII, XIV and XVIII, the terms "import
restrictions" or "export restrictions" include restrictions made
effective through state-trading operations.
</p>

<p>
                            Ad Article XI
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 2 (c)
</p>

<p>
The term "in any form" in this paragraph covers the same products when in
an early stage of processing and still perishable, which compete directly
with the fresh product and if freely imported would tend to make the
restriction on the fresh product ineffective.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 2, last sub-paragraph
</p>

<p>
The term "special factors" includes changes in relative productive
efficiency as between domestic and foreign producers, or as between
different foreign producers but not changes artificially brought about by
means not permitted under the Agreement.
</p>

<p>
                            Ad Article XII
</p>

<p>
The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall make provision for the utmost secrecy in
the conduct of any consultation under the provisions of this Article.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 3 (c) (i)
</p>

<p>
Contracting parties applying restrictions shall endeavour to avoid
causing serious prejudice to exports of a commodity on which the economy
of a contracting party is largely dependent.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 4 (b)
</p>

<p>
It is agreed that the date shall be within ninety days after the entry
into force of the amendments of this Article effected by the Protocol
Amending the Preamble and Parts II and III of this Agreement. However,
should the CONTRACTING PARTIES find that conditions were not suitable for
the application of the provisions of this sub-paragraph at the time
envisaged, they may determine a later date; Provided that such date is
not more than thirty days after such time as the obligations of Article
VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, of the Articles of Agreement of the
International Monetary Fund become applicable to contracting parties,
members of the Fund, the combined foreign trade of which constitutes at
least fifty per centum of the aggregate foreign trade of all contracting
parties.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 4 (e)
</p>

<p>
It is agreed that paragraph 4 (e) does not add any new criteria for the
imposition or maintenance of quantitative restrictions for balance of
payments reasons. It is solely intended to ensure that all external
factors such as changes in the terms of trade, quantitative restrictions,
excessive tariffs and subsidies, which may be contributing to the balance
of payments difficulties of the contracting party applying restrictions,
will be fully taken into account.
</p>

<p>
                           Ad Article XIII
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 2 (d)
</p>

<p>
No mention was made of "commercial considerations" as a rule for the
allocation of quotas because it was considered that its application by
governmental authorities might not always be practicable. Moreover, in
cases where it is practicable, a contracting party could apply these
considerations in the process of seeking agreement, consistently with the
general rule laid down in the opening sentence of paragraph 2.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 4
</p>

<p>
See note relating to "special factors" in connexion with the last
sub-paragraph of paragraph 2 of Article XI.
</p>

<p>
                           Ad Article XIV
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 1
</p>

<p>
The provisions of this paragraph shall not be so construed as to preclude
full consideration by the CONTRACTING PARTIES, in the consultations
provided for in paragraph 4 of Article XII and in paragraph 12 of Article
XVIII, of the nature, effects and reasons for discrimination in the field
of import restrictions.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 2
</p>

<p>
One of the situations contemplated in paragraph 2 is that of a
contracting party holding balances acquired as a result of current
transactions which it finds itself unable to use without a measure of
discrimination.
</p>

<p>
                            Ad Article XV
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 4
</p>

<p>
The word "frustrate" is intended to indicate, for example, that
infringements of the letter of any Article of this Agreement by exchange
action shall not be regarded as a violation of that Article if, in
practice, there is no appreciable departure from the intent of the
Article. Thus, a contracting party which, as part of its exchange control
operated in accordance with the Articles of Agreement of the
International Monetary Fund, requires payment to be received for its
exports in its own currency or in the currency of one or more members of
the International Monetary Fund will not thereby be deemed to contravene
Article XI or Article XIII. Another example would be that of a
contracting party which specifies on an import licence the country from
which the goods may be imported, for the purpose not of introducing any
additional element of discrimination in its import licensing system but
of enforcing permissible exchange controls.
</p>

<p>
                          Ad Article XVI
</p>

<p>
The exemption of an exported product from duties or taxes borne by the
like product when destined for domestic consumption, or the remission of
such duties or taxes in amounts not in excess of those which have
accrued, shall not be deemed to be a subsidy.
</p>

<p>
Section B
</p>

<p>
1. Nothing in Section B shall preclude the use by a contracting party of
multiple rates of exchange in accordance with the Articles of Agreement
of the International Monetary Fund.
</p>

<p>
2. For the purposes of Section B, a "primary product" is understood to be
any product of farm, forest or fishery, or any mineral, in its natural
form or which has undergone such processing as is customarily required to
prepare it for marketing in substantial volume in international trade.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 3
</p>

<p>
1. The fact that a contracting party has not exported the product in
question during the previous representative period would not in itself
preclude that contracting party from establishing its right to obtain a
share of the trade in the product concerned.
</p>

<p>
2. A system for the stabilization of the domestic price or of the return
to domestic producers of a primary product independently of the movements
of export prices, which results at times in the sale of the product for
export at a price lower than the comparable price charged for the like
product to buyers in the domestic market, shall be considered not to
involve a subsidy on exports within the meaning of paragraph 3 if the
CONTRACTING PARTIES determine that:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  the system has also resulted, or is so designed as to result, in
      the sale of the product for export at a price higher than the
      comparable price charged for the like product to buyers in the
      domestic market; and
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  the system is so operated, or is designed so to operate, either
      because of the effective regulation of production or otherwise, as
      not to stimulate exports unduly or otherwise seriously to prejudice
      the interests of other contracting parties.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding such determination by the CONTRACTING PARTIES, operations
under such a system shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph 3
where they are wholly or partly financed out of government funds in
addition to the funds collected from producers in respect of the product
concerned.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 4
</p>

<p>
The intention of paragraph 4 is that the contracting parties should seek
before the end of 1957 to reach agreement to abolish all remaining
subsidies as from l January 1958; or, failing this, to reach agreement to
extend the application of the standstill until the earliest date
thereafter by which they can expect to reach such agreement.
</p>

<p>
                            Ad Article XVII
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 1
</p>

<p>
The operations of Marketing Boards, which are established by contracting
parties and are engaged in purchasing or selling, are subject to the
provisions of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b).
</p>

<p>
The activities of Marketing Boards which are established by contracting
parties and which do not purchase or sell but lay down regulations
covering private trade are governed by the relevant Articles of this
Agreement.
</p>

<p>
The charging by a state enterprise of different prices for its sales of a
product in different markets is not precluded by the provisions of this
Article, provided that such different prices are charged for commercial
reasons, to meet conditions of supply and demand in export markets.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 1 (a)
</p>

<p>
Governmental measures imposed to ensure standards of quality and
efficiency in the operation of external trade, or privileges granted for
the exploitation of national natural resources but which do not empower
the government to exercise control over the trading activities of the
enterprise in question, do not constitute "exclusive or special
privileges".
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 1 (b)
</p>

<p>
A country receiving a "tied loan" is free to take this loan into account
as a "commercial consideration" when purchasing requirements abroad.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 2
</p>

<p>
The term "goods" is limited to products as understood in commercial
practice, and is not intended to include the purchase or sale of
services.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 3
</p>

<p>
Negotiations which contracting parties agree to conduct under this
paragraph may be directed towards the reduction of duties and other
charges on imports and exports or towards the conclusion of any other
mutually satisfactory arrangement consistent with the provisions of this
Agreement. (See paragraph 4 of Article II and the note to that
paragraph.)
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 4 (b)
</p>

<p>
The term "import mark-up" in this paragraph shall represent the margin by
which the price charged by the import monopoly for the imported product
(exclusive of internal taxes within the purview of Article III,
transportation, distribution, and other expenses incident to the
purchase, sale or further processing, and a reasonable margin of profit)
exceeds the landed cost.
</p>

<p>
                           Ad Article XVIII
</p>

<p>
The CONTRACTING PARTIES and the contracting parties concerned shall
preserve the utmost secrecy in respect of matters arising under this
Article.
</p>

<p>
Paragraphs 1 and 4
</p>

<p>
1. When they consider whether the economy of a contracting party "can
only support low standards of living", the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall take
into consideration the normal position of that economy and shall not base
their determination on exceptional circumstances such as those which may
result from the temporary existence of exceptionally favourable
conditions for the staple export product or products of such contracting
party.
</p>

<p>
2. The phrase "in the early stages of development" is not meant to apply
only to contracting parties which have just started their economic
development, but also to contracting parties the economies of which are
undergoing a process of industrialization to correct an excessive
dependence on primary production.
</p>

<p>
Paragraphs 2, 3, 7, 13 and 22
</p>

<p>
The reference to the establishment of particular industries shall apply
not only to the establishment of a new industry, but also to the
establishment of a new branch of production in an existing industry and
to the substantial transformation of an existing industry, and to the
substantial expansion of an existing industry supplying a relatively
small proportion of the domestic demand. It shall also cover the
reconstruction of an industry destroyed or substantially damaged as a
result of hostilities or natural disasters.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 7 (b)
</p>

<p>
A modification or withdrawal, pursuant to paragraph 7 (b), by a
contracting party, other than the applicant contracting party, referred
to in paragraph 7 (a), shall be made within six months of the day on
which the action is taken by the applicant contracting party, and shall
become effective on the thirtieth day following the day on which such
modification or withdrawal has been notified to the CONTRACTING PARTIES.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 11
</p>

<p>
The second sentence in paragraph 11 shall not be interpreted to mean that
a contracting party is required to relax or remove restrictions if such
relaxation or removal would thereupon produce conditions justifying the
intensification or institution, respectively, of restrictions under
paragraph 9 of Article XVIII.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 12 (b)
</p>

<p>
The date referred to in paragraph 12 (b) shall be the date determined by
the CONTRACTING PARTIES in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4
(b) of Article XII of this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
Paragraphs 13 and 14
</p>

<p>
It is recognized that, before deciding on the introduction of a measure
and notifying the CONTRACTING PARTIES in accordance with paragraph 14, a
contracting party may need a reasonable period of time to assess the
competitive position of the industry concerned.
</p>

<p>
Paragraphs 15 and 16
</p>

<p>
It is understood that the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall invite a contracting
party proposing to apply a measure under Section C to consult with them
pursuant to paragraph 16 if they are requested to do so by a contracting
party the trade of which would be appreciably affected by the measure in
question.
</p>

<p>
Paragraphs 16, 18, 19 and 22
</p>

<p>
1. It is understood that the CONTRACTING PARTIES may concur in a proposed
measure subject to specific conditions or limitations. If the measure as
applied does not conform to the terms of the concurrence it will to that
extent be deemed a measure in which the CONTRACTING PARTIES have not
concurred. In cases in which the CONTRACTING PARTIES have concurred in a
measure for a specified period, the contracting party concerned, if it
finds that the maintenance of the measure for a further period of time is
required to achieve the objective for which the measure was originally
taken, may apply to the CONTRACTING PARTIES for an extension of that
period in accordance with the provisions and procedures of Section C or
D, as the case may be.
</p>

<p>
2. It is expected that the CONTRACTING PARTIES will, as a rule, refrain
from concurring in a measure which is likely to cause serious prejudice
to exports of a commodity on which the economy of a contracting party is
largely dependent.
</p>

<p>
Paragraphs 18 and 22
</p>

<p>
The phrase "that the interests of other contracting parties are
adequately safeguarded" is meant to provide latitude sufficient to permit
consideration in each case of the most appropriate method of safeguarding
those interests. The appropriate method may, for instance, take the form
of an additional concession to be applied by the contracting party having
recourse to Section C or D during such time as the deviation from the
other Articles of the Agreement would remain in force or of the temporary
suspension by any other contracting party referred to in paragraph 18 of
a concession substantially equivalent to the impairment due to the
introduction of the measure in question. Such contracting party would
have the right to safeguard its interests through such a temporary
suspension of a concession; Provided that this right will not be
exercised when, in the case of a measure imposed by a contracting party
coming within the scope of paragraph 4 (a), the CONTRACTING PARTIES have
determined that the extent of the compensatory concession proposed was
adequate.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 19
</p>

<p>
The provisions of paragraph 19 are intended to cover the cases where an
industry has been in existence beyond the "reasonable period of time"
referred to in the note to paragraphs 13 and 14, and should not be so
construed as to deprive a contracting party coming within the scope of
paragraph 4(a) of Article XVIII, of its right to resort to the other
provisions of Section C, including paragraph 17, with regard to a newly
established industry even though it has benefited from incidental
protection afforded by balance of payments import restrictions.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 21
</p>

<p>
Any measure taken pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 21 shall be
withdrawn forthwith if the action taken in accordance with paragraph 17
is withdrawn or if the CONTRACTING PARTIES concur in the measure proposed
after the expiration of the ninety-day time limit specified in paragraph
17.
</p>

<p>
                            Ad Article XX
</p>

<p>
Sub-paragraph (h)
</p>

<p>
The exception provided for in this sub-paragraph extends to any commodity
agreement which conforms to the principles approved by the Economic and
Social Council in its resolution 30 (IV) of 28 March 1947.
</p>

<p>
                           Ad Article XXIV
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 9
</p>

<p>
It is understood that the provisions of Article I would require that,
when a product which has been imported into the territory of a member of
a customs union or free-trade area at a preferential rate of duty is
re-exported to the territory of another member of such union or area, the
latter member should collect a duty equal to the difference between the
duty already paid and any higher duty that would be payable if the
product were being imported directly into its territory.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 11
</p>

<p>
Measures adopted by India and Pakistan in order to carry out definitive
trade arrangements between them, once they have been agreed upon, might
depart from particular provisions of this Agreement, but these measures
would in general be consistent with the objectives of the Agreement.
</p>

<p>
                           Ad Article XXVIII
</p>

<p>
The CONTRACTING PARTIES and each contracting party concerned should
arrange to conduct the negotiations and consultations with the greatest
possible secrecy in order to avoid premature disclosure of details of
prospective tariff changes. The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall be informed
immediately of all changes in national tariffs resulting from recourse to
this Article.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 1
</p>

<p>
1. If the CONTRACTING PARTIES specify a period other than a three-year
period, a contracting party may act pursuant to paragraph 1 or paragraph
3 of Article XXVIII on the first day following the expiration of such
other period and, unless the CONTRACTING PARTIES have again specified
another period, subsequent periods will be three-year periods following
the expiration of such specified period.
</p>

<p>
2. The provision that on 1 January 1958, and on other days determined
pursuant to paragraph 1, a contracting party "may . . . modify or
withdraw a concession" means that on such day, and on the first day after
the end of each period, the legal obligation of such contracting party
under Article II is altered; it does not mean that the changes in its
customs tariff should necessarily be made effective on that day. If a
tariff change resulting from negotiations undertaken pursuant to this
Article is delayed, the entry into force of any compensatory concessions
may be similarly delayed.
</p>

<p>
3. Not earlier than six months, nor later than three months, prior to 1
January 1958, or to the termination date of any subsequent period, a
contracting party wishing to modify or withdraw any concession embodied
in the appropriate Schedule, should notify the CONTRACTING PARTIES to
this effect. The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall then determine the contracting
party or contracting parties with which the negotiations or consultations
referred to in paragraph 1 shall take place. Any contracting party so
determined shall participate in such negotiations or consultations with
the applicant contracting party with the aim of reaching agreement before
the end of the period. Any extension of the assured life of the Schedules
shall relate to the Schedules as modified after such negotiations, in
accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Article XXVIII. If the
CONTRACTING PARTIES are arranging for multilateral tariff negotiations to
take place within the period of six months before 1 January 1958, or
before any other day determined pursuant to paragraph 1, they shall
include in the arrangements for such negotiations suitable procedures for
carrying out the negotiations referred to in this paragraph.
</p>

<p>
4. The object of providing for the participation in the negotiations of
any contracting party with a principal supplying interest, in addition to
any contracting party with which the concession was initially negotiated,
is to ensure that a contracting party with a larger share in the trade
affected by the concession than a contracting party with which the
concession was initially negotiated shall have an effective opportunity
to protect the contractual right which it enjoys under this Agreement. On
the other hand, it is not intended that the scope of the negotiations
should be such as to make negotiations and agreement under Article XXVIII
unduly difficult nor to create complications in the application of this
Article in the future to concessions which result from negotiations
thereunder. Accordingly, the CONTRACTING PARTIES should only determine
that a contracting party has a principal supplying interest if that
contracting party has had, over a reasonable period of time prior to the
negotiations, a larger share in the market of the applicant contracting
party than a contracting party with which the concession was initially
negotiated or would, in the judgment of the CONTRACTING PARTIES, have had
such a share in the absence of discriminatory quantitative restrictions
maintained by the applicant contracting party. It would therefore not be
appropriate for the CONTRACTING PARTIES to determine that more than one
contracting party, or in those exceptional cases where there is near
equality more than two contracting parties, had a principal supplying
interest.
</p>

<p>
5. Notwithstanding the definition of a principal supplying interest in
note 4 to paragraph 1, the CONTRACTING PARTIES may exceptionally
determine that a Contracting party has a principal supplying interest if
the concession in question affects trade which constitutes a major part
of the total exports of such contracting party.
</p>

<p>
6. It is not intended that provision for participation in the
negotiations of any contracting party with a principal supplying
interest, and for consultation with any contracting party having a
substantial interest in the concession which the applicant contracting
party is seeking to modify or withdraw, should have the effect that it
should have to pay compensation or suffer retaliation greater than the
withdrawal or modification sought, judged in the light of the conditions
of trade at the time of the proposed withdrawal or modification, making
allowance for any discriminatory quantitative restrictions maintained by
the applicant contracting party.
</p>

<p>
7. The expression "substantial interest" is not capable of a precise
definition and accordingly may present difficulties for the CONTRACTING
PARTIES. It is, however, intended to be construed to cover only those
contracting parties which have, or in the absence of discriminatory
quantitative restrictions affecting their exports could reasonably be
expected to have, a significant share in the market of the contracting
party seeking to modify or withdraw the concession.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 4
</p>

<p>
1. Any request for authorization to enter into negotiations shall be
accompanied by all relevant statistical and other data. A decision on
such request shall be made within thirty days of its submission.
</p>

<p>
2. It is recognized that to permit certain contracting parties, depending
in large measure on a relatively small number of primary commodities and
relying on the tariff as an important aid for furthering diversification
of their economies or as an important source of revenue, normally to
negotiate for the modification or withdrawal of concessions only under
paragraph 1 of Article XXVIII, might cause them at such a time to make
modifications or withdrawals which in the long run would prove
unnecessary. To avoid such a situation the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall
authorize any such contracting party, under paragraph 4, to enter into
negotiations unless they consider this would result in, or contribute
substantially towards, such an increase in tariff levels as to threaten
the stability of the Schedules to this Agreement or lead to undue
disturbance of international trade.
</p>

<p>
3. It is expected that negotiations authorized under paragraph 4 for
modification or withdrawal of a single item, or a very small group of
items, could normally be brought to a conclusion in sixty days. It is
recognized, however, that such a period will be inadequate for cases
involving negotiations for the modification or withdrawal of a larger
number of items and in such cases, therefore, it would be appropriate for
the CONTRACTING PARTIES to prescribe a longer period.
</p>

<p>
4. The determination referred to in paragraph 4 (d) shall be made by the
CONTRACTING PARTIES within thirty days of the submission of the matter to
them unless the applicant contracting party agrees to a longer period.
</p>

<p>
5. In determining under paragraph 4 (d) whether an applicant contracting
party has unreasonably failed to offer adequate compensation, it is
understood that the CONTRACTING PARTIES will take due account of the
special position of a contracting party which has bound a high proportion
of its tariffs at very low rates of duty and to this extent has less
scope than other contracting parties to make compensatory adjustment.
</p>

<p>
                      Ad Article XXVIII bis
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 3
</p>

<p>
It is understood that the reference to fiscal needs would include the
revenus aspect of duties and particularly duties imposed primarily for
revenue purpose, or duties imposed on products which can be substituted
for products subject to revenue duties to prevent the avoidance of such
duties.
</p>

<p>
                         Ad Article XXIX
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 1
</p>

<p>
Chapters VII and VIII of the Havana Charter have been excluded from
paragraph 1 because they generally deal with the organization, functions
and procedures of the International Trade Organization.
</p>

<p>
                           Ad Part IV
</p>

<p>
The words "developed contracting parties" and the words "less-developed
contracting parties" as used in Part IV are to be understood to refer to
developed and less-developed countries which are parties to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
</p>

<p>
                         Ad Article XXXVI
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 1
</p>

<p>
This Article is based upon the objectives set forth in Article I as it
will be amended by Section A of paragraph 1 of the Protocol Amending Part
I and Articles XXIX and XXX when that Protocol enters into force.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 4
</p>

<p>
The term "primary products" includes agricultural products, vide
paragraph 2 of the note ad Article XVI, Section B.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 5
</p>

<p>
A diversification programme would generally include the intensification
of activities for the processing of primary products and the development
of manufacturing industries, taking into account the situation of the
particular contracting party and the world outlook for production and
consumption of different commodities.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 8
</p>

<p>
It is understood that the phrase "do not expect reciprocity" means, in
accordance with the objectives set forth in this Article, that the
less-developed contracting parties should not be expected, in the course
of trade negotiations, to make contributions which are inconsistent with
their individual development, financial and trade needs, taking into
consideration past trade developments.
</p>

<p>
This paragraph would apply in the event of action under Section A of
Article XVIII, Article XXVIII, Article XXVIII bis (Article XXIX after the
amendment set forth in Section A of paragraph 1 of the Protocol Amending
Part I and Articles XXIX and XXX shall have become effective), Article
XXXIII, or any other procedure under this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
                        Ad Article XXXVII
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 1 (a)
</p>

<p>
This paragraph would apply in the event of negotiations for reduction or
elimination of tariffs or other restrictive regulations of commerce under
Articles XXVIII, XXVIII bis (XXIX after the amendment set forth in
Section A of paragraph 1 of the Protocol Amending Part I and Articles
XXIX and XXX shall have become effective), and Article XXXIII, as well as
in connexion with other action to effect such reduction or elimination
which contracting parties may be able to undertake.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph 3 (b)
</p>

<p>
The other measures referred to in this paragraph might include steps to
promote domestic structural changes, to encourage the consumption of
particular products, or to introduce measures of trade promotion.
