<h3>Article V
Freedom of Transit</h3>

<hr />

<p>


1. Goods (including baggage), and also vessels and other means of
transport, shall be deemed to be in transit across the territory of a
contracting party when the passage across such territory, with or without
trans-shipment, warehousing, breaking bulk, or change in the mode of
transport, is only a portion of a complete journey beginning and
terminating beyond the frontier of the contracting party across whose
territory the traffic passes. Traffic of this nature is termed in this
Article " traffic in transit ".
</p>

<p>
2. There shall be freedom of transit through the territory of each
contracting party, via the routes most convenient for international
transit, for traffic in transit to or from the territory of other
contracting parties. No distinction shall be made which is based on the
flag of vessels, the place of origin, departure, entry, exit or
destination, or on any circumstances relating to the ownership of goods,
of vessels or of other means of transport.
</p>

<p>
3. Any contracting party may require that traffic in transit through its
territory be entered at the proper custom house, but, except in cases of
failure to comply with applicable customs laws and regulations, such
traffic coming from or going to the territory of other contracting
parties shall not be subject to any unnecessary delays or restrictions
and shall be exempt from customs duties and from all transit duties or
other charges imposed in respect of transit, except charges for
transportation or those commensurate with administrative expenses
entailed by transit or with the cost of services rendered.
</p>

<p>
4. All charges and regulations imposed by contracting parties on traffic
in transit to or from the territories of other contracting parties shall
be reasonable, having regard to the conditions of the traffic.
</p>

<p>
5. With respect to all charges, regulations and formalities in connection
with transit, each contracting party shall accord to traffic in transit
to or from the territory of any other contracting party treatment no less
favourable than the treatment accorded to traffic in transit to or from
any third country.
</p>

<p>
6. Each contracting party shall accord to products which have been in
transit through the territory of any other contracting party treatment no
less favourable than that which would have been accorded to such products
had they been transported from their place of origin to their destination
without going through the territory of such other contracting party. Any
contracting party shall, however, be free to maintain its requirements of
direct consignment existing on the date of this Agreement, in respect of
any goods in regard to which such direct consignment is a requisite
condition of eligibility for entry of the goods at preferential rates of
duty or has relation to the contracting party's prescribed method of
valuation for duty purposes.
</p>

<p>
7. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to the operation of
aircraft in transit, but shall apply to air transit of goods (including
baggage).
