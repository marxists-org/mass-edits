The General Agreement On Tariffs And Trade
</p>

<hr />


<h3>Article XVIII
Governmental Assistance to Economic Development</h3>

<hr />

<p>


1. The contracting parties recognize that the attainment of the
objectives of this Agreement will be facilitated by the progressive
development of their economies, particularly of those contracting parties
the economies of which can only support low standards of living and are
in the early stages of development.
</p>

<p>
2. The contracting parties recognize further that it may be necessary for
those contracting parties, in order to implement programmes and policies
of economic development designed to raise the general standard of living
of their people, to take protective or other measures affecting imports,
and that such measures are justified in so far as they facilitate the
attainment of the objectives of this Agreement. They agree, therefore,
that those contracting parties should enjoy additional facilities to
enable them (a) to maintain sufficient flexibility in their tariff
structure to be able to grant the tariff protection required for the
establishment of a particular industry and (b) to apply quantitative
restrictions for balance of payments purposes in a manner which takes
full account of the continued high level of demand for imports likely to
be generated by their programmes of economic development.
</p>

<p>
3. The contracting parties recognize finally that, with those additional
facilities which are provided for in Sections A and B of this Article,
the provisions of this Agreement would normally be sufficient to enable
contracting parties to meet the requirements of their economic
development. They agree, however, that there may be circumstances where
no measure consistent with those provisions is practicable to permit a
contracting party in the process of economic development to grant the
governmental assistance required to promote the establishment of
particular industries with a view to raising the general standard of
living of its people. Special procedures are laid down in Sections C and
D of this Article to deal with those cases.
</p>

<p>
4. </p><p class="indentb">(a) Consequently, a contracting party the economy of which can only
support low standards of living and is in the early stages of development
shall be free to deviate temporarily from the provisions of the other
Articles of this Agreement, as provided in Sections A, B and C of this
Article.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (b) A contracting party the economy of which is in the process of
development, but which does not come within the scope of sub-paragraph
(a) above, may submit applications to the CONTRACTING PARTIES under
Section D of this Article.
</p>

<p>
5. The contracting parties recognize that the export earnings of
contracting parties, the economies of which are of the type described in
paragraph 4 (a) and (b) above and which depend on exports of a small
number of primary commodities, may be seriously reduced by a decline in
the sale of such commodities. Accordingly, when the exports of primary
commodities by such a contracting party are seriously affected by
measures taken by another contracting party, it may have resort to the
consultation provisions of Article XXII of this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
6. The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall review annually all measures applied
pursuant to the provisions of Sections C and D of this Article.
</p>

<h5>
                              Section A
</h5>

<p>
7. </p><p class="indentb">(a) If a contracting party coming within the scope of paragraph 4 (a)
of this Article considers it desirable, in order to promote the
establishment of a particular industry with a view to raising the general
standard of living of its people, to modify or withdraw a concession
included in the appropriate Schedule annexed to this Agreement, it shall
notify the CONTRACTING PARTIES to this effect and enter into negotiations
with any contracting party with which such concession was initially
negotiated, and with any other contracting party determined by the
CONTRACTING PARTIES to have a substantial interest therein. If agreement
is reached between such contracting parties concerned, they shall be free
to modify or withdraw concessions under the appropriate Schedules to this
Agreement in order to give effect to such agreement, including any
compensatory adjustments involved.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (b) If agreement is not reached within sixty days after the
notification provided for in sub-paragraph (a) above, the contracting
party which proposes to modify or withdraw the concession may refer the
matter to the CONTRACTING PARTIES, which shall promptly examine it. If
they find that the contracting party which proposes to modify or withdraw
the concession has made every effort to reach an agreement and that the
compensatory adjustment offered by it is adequate, that contracting party
shall be free to modify or withdraw the concession if, at the same time,
it gives effect to the compensatory adjustment. If the CONTRACTING
PARTIES do not find that the compensation offered by a contracting party
proposing to modify or withdraw the concession is adequate, but find that
it has made every reasonable effort to offer adequate compensation, that
contracting party shall be free to proceed with such modification or
withdrawal. If such action is taken, any other contracting party referred
to in sub-paragraph (a) above shall be free to modify or withdraw
substantially equivalent concessions initially negotiated with the
contracting party which has taken the action.
</p>

<h5>
                              Section B
</h5>

<p>
8. The contracting parties recognize that contracting parties coming
within the scope of paragraph 4 (a) of this Article tend, when they are
in rapid process of development, to experience balance of payments
difficulties arising mainly from efforts to expand their internal markets
as well as from the instability in their terms of trade.
</p>

<p>
9. In order to safeguard its external financial position and to ensure a
level of reserves adequate for the implementation of its programme of
economic development, a contracting party coming within the scope of
paragraph 4 (a) of this Article may, subject to the provisions of
paragraphs 10 to 12, control the general level of its imports by
restricting the quantity or value of merchandise permitted to be
imported; Provided that the import restrictions instituted, maintained or
intensified shall not exceed those necessary:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  to forestall the threat of, or to stop, a serious decline in its
      monetary reserves, or
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  in the case of a contracting party with inadequate monetary
      reserves, to achieve a reasonable rate of increase in its reserves.
</p>

<p>
Due regard shall be paid in either case to any special factors which may
be affecting the reserves of the contracting party or its need for
reserves, including, where special external credits or other resources
are available to it, the need to provide for the appropriate use of such
credits or resources.
</p>

<p>
10. In applying these restrictions, the contracting party may determine
their incidence on imports of different products or classes of products
in such a way as to give priority to the importation of those products
which are more essential in the light of its policy of economic
development; Provided that the restrictions are so applied as to avoid
unnecessary damage to the commercial or economic interests of any other
contracting party and not to prevent unreasonably the importation of any
description of goods in minimum commercial quantities the exclusion of
which would impair regular channels of trade; and Provided further that
the restrictions are not so applied as to prevent the importation of
commercial samples or to prevent compliance with patent, trade mark,
copyright or similar procedures.
</p>

<p>
11. In carrying out its domestic policies, the contracting party
concerned shall pay due regard to the need for restoring equilibrium in
its balance of payments on a sound and lasting basis and to the
desirability of assuring an economic employment of productive resources.
It shall progressively relax any restrictions applied under this Section
as conditions improve, maintaining them only to the extent necessary
under the terms of paragraph 9 of this Article and shall eliminate them
when conditions no longer justify such maintenance; Provided that no
contracting party shall be required to withdraw or modify restrictions on
the ground that a change in its development policy would render
unnecessary the restrictions which it is applying under this Section.
</p>

<p>
12. </p><p class="indentb">(a) Any contracting party applying new restrictions or raising the
general level of its existing restrictions by a substantial
intensification of the measures applied under this Section, shall
immediately after instituting or intensifying such restrictions (or, in
circumstances in which prior consultation is practicable, before doing
so) consult with the CONTRACTING PARTIES as to the nature of its balance
of payments difficulties, alternative corrective measures which may be
available, and the possible effect of the restrictions on the economies
of other contracting parties.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (b) On a date to be determined by them, the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall
review all restrictions still applied under this Section on that date.
Beginning two years after that date, contracting parties applying
restrictions under this Section shall enter into consultations of the
type provided for in sub-paragraph (a) above with the CONTRACTING PARTIES
at intervals of approximately, but not less than, two years according to
a programme to be drawn up each year by the CONTRACTING PARTIES; Provided
that no consultation under this sub-paragraph shall take place within two
years after the conclusion of a consultation of a general nature under
any other provision of this paragraph.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
(c) </p>
<p class="indentc">(i) If, in the course of consultations with a contracting party under
sub-paragraph (a) or (b) of this paragraph, the CONTRACTING PARTIES find
that the restrictions are not consistent with the provisions of this
Section or with those of Article XIII (subject to the provisions of
Article XIV), they shall indicate the nature of the inconsistency and may
advise that the restrictions be suitably modified.
</p>

<p class="indentc">
     (ii) If, however, as a result of the consultations, the CONTRACTING
PARTIES determine that the restrictions are being applied in a manner
involving an inconsistency of a serious nature with the provisions of
this Section or with those of Article XIII (subject to the provisions of
Article XIV) and that damage to the trade of any contracting party is
caused or threatened thereby, they shall so inform the contracting party
applying the restrictions and shall make appropriate recommendations for
securing conformity with such provisions within a specified period. If
such contracting party does not comply with these recommendations within
the specified period, the CONTRACTING PARTIES may release any contracting
party the trade of which is adversely affected by the restrictions from
such obligations under this Agreement towards the contracting party
applying the restrictions as they determine to be appropriate in the
circumstances.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (d) The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall invite any contracting party which
is applying restrictions under this Section to enter into consultations
with them at the request of any contracting party which can establish a
prima facie case that the restrictions are inconsistent with the
provisions of this Section or with those of Article XIII (subject to the
provisions of Article XIV) and that its trade is adversely affected
thereby. However, no such invitation shall be issued unless the
CONTRACTING PARTIES have ascertained that direct discussions between the
contracting parties concerned have not been successful. If, as a result
of the consultations with the CONTRACTING PARTIES no agreement is reached
and they determine that the restrictions are being applied inconsistently
with such provisions, and that damage to the trade of the contracting
party initiating the procedure is caused or threatened thereby, they
shall recommend the withdrawal or modification of the restrictions. If
the restrictions are not withdrawn or modified within such time as the
CONTRACTING PARTIES may prescribe, they may release the contracting party
initiating the procedure from such obligations under this Agreement
towards the contracting party applying the restrictions as they determine
to be appropriate in the circumstances.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (e) If a contracting party against which action has been taken in
accordance with the last sentence of sub-paragraph (c) (ii) or (d) of
this paragraph, finds that the release of obligations authorized by the
CONTRACTING PARTIES adversely affects the operation of its programme and
policy of economic development, it shall be free, not later than sixty
days after such action is taken, to give written notice to the Executive
Secretary 1 to the CONTRACTING PARTIES of its intention to withdraw from
this Agreement and such withdrawal shall take effect on the sixtieth day
following the day on which the notice is received by him.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (f) In proceeding under this paragraph, the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall
have due regard to the factors referred to in paragraph 2 of this
Article. Determinations under this paragraph shall be rendered
expeditiously and, if possible, within sixty days of the initiation of
the consultations.
</p>

<h5>
                              Section C
</h5>

<p>
13. If a contracting party coming within the scope of paragraph 4 (a) of
this Article finds that governmental assistance is required to promote
the establishment of a particular industry with a view to raising the
general standard of living of its people, but that no measure consistent
with the other provisions of this Agreement is practicable to achieve
that objective, it may have recourse to the provisions and procedures set
out in this Section.
</p>

<p>
14. The contracting party concerned shall notify the CONTRACTING PARTIES
of the special difficulties which it meets in the achievement of the
objective outlined in paragraph 13 of this Article and shall indicate the
specific measure affecting imports which it proposes to introduce in
order to remedy these difficulties. It shall not introduce that measure
before the expiration of the time-limit laid down in paragraph 15 or 17,
as the case may be, or if the measure affects imports of a product which
is the subject of a concession included in the appropriate Schedule
annexed to this Agreement, unless it has secured the concurrence of the
CONTRACTING PARTIES in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 18;
Provided that, if the industry receiving assistance has already started
production, the contracting party may, after informing the CONTRACTING
PARTIES, take such measures as may be necessary to prevent, during that
period, imports of the product or products concerned from increasing
substantially above a normal level.
</p>

<p>
15. If, within thirty days of the notification of the measure, the
CONTRACTING PARTIES do not request the contracting party concerned to
consult with them, that contracting party shall be free to deviate from
the relevant provisions of the other Articles of this Agreement to the
extent necessary to apply the proposed measure.
</p>

<p>
16. If it is requested by the CONTRACTING PARTIES to do so, the
contracting party concerned shall consult with them as to the purpose of
the proposed measure, as to alternative measures which may be available
under this Agreement, and as to the possible effect of the measure
proposed on the commercial and economic interests of other contracting
parties. If, as a result of such consultation, the CONTRACTING PARTIES
agree that there is no measure consistent with the other provisions of
this Agreement which is practicable in order to achieve the objective
outlined in paragraph 13 of this Article, and concur in the proposed
measure, the contracting party concerned shall be released from its
obligations under the relevant provisions of the other Articles of this
Agreement to the extent necessary to apply that measure.
</p>

<p>
17. If, within ninety days after the date of the notification of the
proposed measure under paragraph 14 of this Article, the CONTRACTING
PARTIES have not concurred in such measure, the contracting party
concerned may introduce the measure proposed after informing the
CONTRACTING PARTIES.
</p>

<p>
18. If the proposed measure affects a product which is the subject of a
concession included in the appropriate Schedule annexed to this
Agreement, the contracting party concerned shall enter into consultations
with any other contracting party with which the concession was initially
negotiated, and with any other contracting party determined by the
CONTRACTING PARTIES to have a substantial interest therein. The
CONTRACTING PARTIES shall concur in the measure if they agree that there
is no measure consistent with the other provisions of this Agreement
which is practicable in order to achieve the objective set forth in
paragraph 13 of this Article, and if they are satisfied:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  that agreement has been reached with such other contracting parties
      as a result of the consultations referred to above, or
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  if no such agreement has been reached within sixty days after the
      notification provided for in paragraph 14 has been received by the
      CONTRACTING PARTIES, that the contracting party having recourse to
      this Section has made all reasonable efforts to reach an agreement
      and that the interests of other contracting parties are adequately
      safeguarded.
</p>

<p>
The contracting party having recourse to this Section shall thereupon be
released from its obligations under the relevant provisions of the other
Articles of this Agreement to the extent necessary to permit it to apply
the measure.
</p>

<p>
19. If a proposed measure of the type described in paragraph 13 of this
Article concerns an industry the establishment of which has in the
initial period been facilitated by incidental protection afforded by
restrictions imposed by the contracting party concerned for balance of
payments purposes under the relevant provisions of this Agreement, that
contracting party may resort to the provisions and procedures of this
Section; Provided that it shall not apply the proposed measure without
the concurrence of the CONTRACTING PARTIES.
</p>

<p>
20. Nothing in the preceding paragraphs of this Section shall authorize
any deviation from the provisions of Articles I, II and XIII of this
Agreement. The provisos to paragraph 10 of this Article shall also be
applicable to any restriction under this Section.
</p>

<p>
21. At any time while a measure is being applied under paragraph 17 of
this Article any contracting party substantially affected by it may
suspend the application to the trade of the contracting party having
recourse to this Section of such substantially equivalent concessions or
other obligations under this Agreement the suspension of which the
CONTRACTING PARTIES do not disapprove; Provided that sixty days' notice
of such suspension is given to the CONTRACTING PARTIES not later than six
months after the measure has been introduced or changed substantially to
the detriment of the contracting party affected. Any such contracting
party shall afford adequate opportunity for consultation in accordance
with the provisions of Article XXII of this Agreement.
</p>

<h5>
                              Section D
</h5>

<p>
22. A contracting party coming within the scope of sub-paragraph 4 (b) of
this Article desiring, in the interest of the development of its economy,
to introduce a measure of the type described in paragraph 13 of this
Article in respect of the establishment of a particular industry may
apply to the CONTRACTING PARTIES for approval of such measure. The
CONTRACTING PARTIES shall promptly consult with such contracting party
and shall, in making their decision, be guided by the considerations set
out in paragraph 16. If the CONTRACTING PARTIES concur in the proposed
measure the contracting party concerned shall be released from its
obligations under the relevant provisions of the other Articles of this
Agreement to the extent necessary to permit it to apply the measure. If
the proposed measure affects a product which is the subject of a
concession included in the appropriate Schedule annexed to this
Agreement, the provisions of paragraph 18 shall apply.
</p>

<p>
23. Any measure applied under this Section shall comply with the
provisions of paragraph 20 of this Article.
