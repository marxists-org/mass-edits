The General Agreement On Tariffs And Trade
</p>

<hr />


<h3>Article XXVIII
Modification of Schedules</h3>

<hr />

<p>


1. On the first day of each three-year period, the first period beginning
on 1 January 1958 (or on the first day of any other period that may be
specified by the CONTRACTING PARTIES by two-thirds of the votes cast) a
contracting party (hereafter in this Article referred to as the
"applicant contracting party") may, by negotiation and agreement with any
contracting party with which such concession was initially negotiated and
with any other contracting party determined by the CONTRACTING PARTIES to
have a principal supplying interest (which two preceding categories of
contracting parties, together with the applicant contracting party, are
in this Article hereinafter referred to as the "contracting parties
primarily concerned"), and subject to consultation with any other
contracting party determined by the CONTRACTING PARTIES to have a
substantial interest in such concession, modify or withdraw a concession
included in the appropriate Schedule annexed to this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
2. In such negotiations and agreement, which may include provision for
compensatory adjustment with respect to other products, the contracting
parties concerned shall endeavour to maintain a general level of
reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions not less favourable to
trade than that provided for in this Agreement prior to such
negotiations.
</p>

<p>
3.</p>
<p class="indentb"> (a) If agreement between the contracting parties primarily concerned
cannot be reached before 1 January 1958 or before the expiration of a
period envisaged in paragraph 1 of this Article, the contracting party
which proposes to modify or withdraw the concession shall, nevertheless,
be free to do so and if such action is taken any contracting party with
which such concession was initially negotiated, any contracting party
determined under paragraph 1 to have a principal supplying interest and
any contracting party determined under paragraph I to have a substantial
interest shall then be free not later than six months after such action
is taken, to withdraw, upon the expiration of thirty days from the day on
which written notice of such withdrawal is received by the CONTRACTING
PARTIES, substantially equivalent concessions initially negotiated with
the applicant contracting party.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
    (b) If agreement between the contracting parties primarily concerned
is reached but any other contracting party determined under paragraph 1
of this Article to have a substantial interest is not satisfied, such
other contracting party shall be free, not later than six months after
action under such agreement is taken, to withdraw, upon the expiration of
thirty days from the day on which written notice of such withdrawal is
received by the CONTRACTING PARTIES, substantially equivalent concessions
initially negotiated with the applicant contracting party.
</p>

<p>
4. The CONTRACTING PARTIES may, at any time, in special circumstances,
authorize a contracting party to enter into negotiations for modification
or withdrawal of a concession included in the appropriate Schedule
annexed to this Agreement subject to the following procedures and
conditions:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  Such negotiations* and any related consultations shall be conducted
      in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this
      Article.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  If agreement between the contracting parties primarily concerned is
      reached in the negotiations, the provisions of paragraph 3 (b) of
      this Article shall apply.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (c)  If agreement between the contracting parties primarily concerned is
      not reached within a period of sixty days after negotiations have
      been authorized, or within such longer period as the CONTRACTING
      PARTIES may have prescribed, the applicant contracting party may
      refer the matter to the CONTRACTING PARTIES.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (d)  Upon such reference, the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall promptly examine
      the matter and submit their views to the contracting parties
      primarily concerned with the aim of achieving a settlement. If a
      settlement is reached, the provisions of paragraph 3 (b) shall
      apply as if agreement between the contracting parties primarily
      concerned had been reached. If no settlement is reached between the
      contracting parties primarily concerned, the applicant contracting
      party shall be free to modify or withdraw the concession, unless
      the CONTRACTING PARTIES determine that the applicant contracting
      party has unreasonably failed to offer adequate compensation. If
      such action is taken, any contracting party with which the
      concession was initially negotiated, any contracting party
      determined under paragraph 4 (a) to have a principal supplying
      interest and any contracting party determined under paragraph 4 (a)
      to have a substantial interest, shall be free, not later than six
      months after such action is taken, to modify or withdraw, upon the
      expiration of thirty days from the day on which written notice of
      such withdrawal is received by the CONTRACTING PARTIES,
      substantially equivalent concessions initially negotiated with the
      applicant contracting party.
</p>

<p>
5. Before 1 January 1958 and before the end of any period envisaged in
paragraph 1 a contracting party may elect by notifying the CONTRACTING
PARTIES to reserve the right, for the duration of the next period, to
modify the appropriate Schedule in accordance with the procedures of
paragraphs 1 to 3. If a contracting party so elects, other contracting
parties shall have the right, during the same period, to modify or
withdraw, in accordance with the same procedures, concessions initially
negotiated with that contracting party.
</p>

<h5>
Article XXVIII vis<br />
Tariff Negotiations
</h5>

<p>
1. The contracting parties recognize that customs duties often constitute
serious obstacles to trade; thus negotiations on a reciprocal and
mutually advantageous basis, directed to the substantial reduction of the
general level of tariffs and other charges on imports and exports and in
particular to the reduction of such high tariffs as discourage the
importation even of minimum quantities, and conducted with due regard to
the objectives of this Agreement and the varying needs of individual
contracting parties, are of great importance to the expansion of
international trade. The CONTRACTING PARTES may therefore sponsor such
negotiations from time to time.
</p>

<p>
2.</p>
<p class="indentb"> (a) Negotiations under this Article may be carried out on a selective
product-by-product basis or by the application of such multilateral
procedures as may be accepted by the contracting parties concerned. Such
negotiations may be directed towards the reduction of duties, the binding
of duties at then existing levels or undertakings that individual duties
or the average duties on specified categories of products shall not
exceed specified levels. The binding against increase of low duties or of
duty-free treatment shall, in principle, be recognized as a concession
equivalent in value to the reduction of high duties.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b) The contracting parties recognize that in general the success of
multilateral negotiations would depend on the participation of all
contracting parties which conduct a substantial proportion of their
external trade with one another.
</p>

<p>
3. Negotiations shall be conducted on a basis which affords adequate
opportunity to take into account:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  the needs of individual contracting parties and individual
      industries;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  the needs of less-developed countries for a more flexible use of
      tariff protection to assist their economic development and the
      special needs of these countries to maintain tariffs for revenue
      purposes; and
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (c)  all other relevant circumstances, including the fiscal,
      developmental, strategic and other needs of the contracting parties
      concerned.
