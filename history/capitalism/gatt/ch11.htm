<h3>Article XI
General Elimination of Quantitative Restrictions</h3>

<hr />

<p>


1. No prohibitions or restrictions other than duties, taxes or other
charges, whether made effective through quotas, import or export licences
or other measures, shall be instituted or maintained by any contracting
party on the importation of any product of the territory of any other
contracting party or on the exportation or sale for export of any product
destined for the territory of any other contracting party.
</p>

<p>
2. The provisions of paragraph I of this Article shall not extend to the
following:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  Export prohibitions or restrictions temporarily applied to prevent
      or relieve critical shortages of foodstuffs or other products
      essential to the exporting contracting party;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  Import and export prohibitions or restrictions necessary to the
      application of standards or regulations for the classification,
      grading or marketing of commodities in international trade;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (c)  Import restrictions on any agricultural or fisheries product,
      imported in any form, necessary to the enforcement of governmental
      measures which operate:
</p>

<p class="indentc">
      (i)   to restrict the quantities of the like domestic product
            permitted to be marketed or produced, or, if there is no
            substantial domestic production of the like product, of a
            domestic product for which the imported product can be
            directly substituted; or
</p>

<p class="indentc">
      (ii)  to remove a temporary surplus of the like domestic product,
            or, if there is no substantial domestic production of the
            like product, of a domestic product for which the imported
            product can be directly substituted, by making the surplus
            available to certain groups of domestic consumers free of
            charge or at prices below the current market level; or
</p>

<p class="indentc">
      (iii) to restrict the quantities permitted to be produced of any
            animal product the production of which is directly dependent,
            wholly or mainly, on the imported commodity, if the domestic
            production of that commodity is relatively negligible.
</p>

<p>
Any contracting party applying restrictions on the importation of any
product pursuant to sub-paragraph (c) of this paragraph shall give public
notice of the total quantity or value of the product permitted to be
imported during a specified future period and of any change in such
quantity or value. Moreover, any restrictions applied under (i) above
shall not be such as will reduce the total of imports relative to the
total of domestic production, as compared with the proportion which might
reasonably be expected to rule between the two in the absence of
restrictions. In determining this proportion, the contracting party shall
pay due regard to the proportion prevailing during a previous
representative period and to any special factors which may have affected
or may be affecting the trade in the product concerned.
