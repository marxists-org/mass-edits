contracting party of measures:

 (c)  relating to the importation or exportation of gold or silver;
</p>

<p class="indentb">

      commodity agreement which conforms to criteria submitted to the
      CONTRACTING PARTIES and not disapproved by them or which is itself

      processing industry during periods when the domestic price of such
      materials is held below the world price as part of a governmental
      stabilization plan; Provided that such restrictions shall not
      operate to increase the exports of or the protection afforded to
      such domestic industry, and shall not depart from the provisions of
      this Agreement relating to non-discrimination;

<p class="indentb">
 (j)  essential to the acquisition or distribution of products in general
      or local short supply; Provided that any such measures shall be
