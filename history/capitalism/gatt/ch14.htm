The General Agreement On Tariffs And Trade
</p>

<hr />


<h3>Article XIV
Exceptions to the Rule of Non-discrimination</h3>

<hr />

<p>


1. A contracting party which applies restrictions under Article XII or
under Section B of Article XVIII may, in the application of such
restrictions, deviate from the provisions of Article XIII in a manner
having equivalent effect to restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions which that contracting party may at
that time apply under Article VIII or XIV of the Articles of Agreement of
the International Monetary Fund, or under analogous provisions of a
special exchange agreement entered into pursuant to paragraph 6 of
Article XV.
</p>

<p>
2. A contracting party which is applying import restrictions under
Article XII or under Section B of Article XVIII may, with the consent of
the CONTRACTING PARTIES, temporarily deviate from the provisions of
Article XIII in respect of a small part of its external trade where the
benefits to the contracting party or contracting parties concerned
substantially outweigh any injury which may result to the trade of other
contracting parties.
</p>

<p>
3. The provisions of Article XIII shall not preclude a group of
territories having a common quota in the International Monetary Fund from
applying against imports from other countries, but not among themselves,
restrictions in accordance with the provisions of Article XII or of
Section B of Article XVIII on condition that such restrictions are in all
other respects consistent with the provisions of Article XIII.
</p>

<p>
4. A contracting party applying import restrictions under Article XII or
under Section B of Article XVIII shall not be precluded by Articles XI to
XV or Section B of Article XVIII of this Agreement from applying measures
to direct its exports in such a manner as to increase its earnings of
currencies which it can use without deviation from the provisions of
Article XIII.
</p>

<p>
5. A contracting party shall not be precluded by Articles XI to XV,
inclusive, or by Section B of Article XVIII, of this Agreement from
applying quantitative restrictions:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  having equivalent effect to exchange restrictions authorized under
      Section 3 (b) of Article VII of the Articles of Agreement of the
      International Monetary Fund, or
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  under the preferential arrangements provided for in Annex A of this
      Agreement, pending the outcome of the negotiations referred to
      therein.
