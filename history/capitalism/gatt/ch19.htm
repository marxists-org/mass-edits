<h3>Article XIX
Emergency Action on Imports of Particular Products</h3>

<hr />

<p>


1. </p><p class="indentb">(a) If, as a result of unforeseen developments and of the effect of
the obligations incurred by a contracting party under this Agreement,
including tariff concessions, any product is being imported into the
territory of that contracting party in such increased quantities and
under such conditions as to cause or threaten serious injury to domestic
producers in that territory of like or directly competitive products, the
contracting party shall be free, in respect of such product, and to the
extent and for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such
injury, to suspend the obligation in whole or in part or to withdraw or
modify the concession.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (b) If any product, which is the subject of a concession with respect
to a preference, is being imported into the territory of a contracting
party in the circumstances set forth in sub-paragraph (a) of this
paragraph, so as to cause or threaten serious injury to domestic
producers of like or directly competitive products in the territory of a
contracting party which receives or received such preference, the
importing contracting party shall be free, if that other contracting
party so requests, to suspend the relevant obligation in whole or in part
or to withdraw or modify the concession in respect of the product, to the
extent and for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such
injury.
</p>

<p>
2. Before any contracting party shall take action pursuant to the
provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall give notice in
writing to the CONTRACTING PARTIES as far in advance as may be
practicable and shall afford the CONTRACTING PARTIES and those
contracting parties having a substantial interest as exporters of the
product concerned an opportunity to consult with it in respect of the
proposed action. When such notice is given in relation to a concession
with respect to a preference, the notice shall name the contracting party
which has requested the action. In critical circumstances, where delay
would cause damage which it would be difficult to repair, action under
paragraph 1 of this Article may be taken provisionally without prior
consultation, on the condition that consultation shall be effected
immediately after taking such action.
</p>

<p>
3. </p><p class="indentb">(a) If agreement among the interested contracting parties with respect
to the action is not reached, the contracting party which proposes to
take or continue the action shall, nevertheless, be free to do so, and if
such action is taken or continued, the affected contracting parties shall
then be free, not later than ninety days after such action is taken, to
suspend, upon the expiration of thirty days from the day on which written
notice of such suspension is received by the CONTRACTING PARTIES, the
application to the trade of the contracting party taking such action, or,
in the case envisaged in paragraph 1 (b) of this Article, to the trade of
the contracting party requesting such action, of such substantially
equivalent concessions or other obligations under this Agreement the
suspension of which the CONTRACTING PARTIES do not disapprove.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this
paragraph, where action is taken under paragraph 2 of this Article
without prior consultation and causes or threatens serious injury in the
territory of a contracting party to the domestic producers of products
affected by the action, that contracting party shall, where delay would
cause damage difficult to repair, be free to suspend, upon the taking of
the action and throughout the period of consultation, such concessions or
other obligations as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the injury.
