<h3>Article IX
Marks of Origin</h3>

<hr />

<p>


1. Each contracting party shall accord to the products of the territories
of other contracting parties treatment with regard to marking
requirements no less favourable than the treatment accorded to like
products of any third country.
</p>

<p>
2. The contracting parties recognize that, in adopting and enforcing laws
and regulations relating to marks of origin, the difficulties and
inconveniences which such measures may cause to the commerce and industry
of exporting countries should be reduced to a minimum, due regard being
had to the necessity of protecting consumers against fraudulent or
misleading indications.
</p>

<p>
3. Whenever it is administratively practicable to do so, contracting
parties should permit required marks of origin to be affixed at the time
of importation.
</p>

<p>
4. The laws and regulations of contracting parties relating to the
marking of imported products shall be such as to permit compliance
without seriously damaging the products, or materially reducing their
value, or unreasonably increasing their cost.
</p>

<p>
5. As a general rule, no special duty or penalty should be imposed by any
contracting party for failure to comply with marking requirements prior
to importation unless corrective marking is unreasonably delayed or
deceptive marks have been affixed or the required marking has been
intentionally omitted.
</p>

<p>
6. The contracting parties shall co-operate with each other with a view
to preventing the use of trade names in such manner as to misrepresent
the true origin of a product, to the detriment of such distinctive
regional or geographical names of products of the territory of a
contracting party as are protected by its legislation. Each contracting
party shall accord full and sympathetic consideration to such requests or
representations as may be made by any other contracting party regarding
the application of the undertaking set forth in the preceding sentence to
names of products which have been communicated to it by the other
contracting party.
