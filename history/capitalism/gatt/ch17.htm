<h3>Article XVII
State Trading Enterprises</h3>

<hr />

<p>


1. </p><p class="indentb">(a) Each contracting party undertakes that if it establishes or
maintains a State enterprise, wherever located, or grants to any
enterprise, formally or in effect, exclusive or special privileges, such
enterprise shall, in its purchases or sales involving either imports or
exports, act in a manner consistent with the general principles of
non-discriminatory treatment prescribed in this Agreement for
governmental measures affecting imports or exports by private traders.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (b) The provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph shall be
understood to require that such enterprises shall, having due regard to
the other provisions of this Agreement, make any such purchases or sales
solely in accordance with commercial considerations, including price,
quality, availability, marketability, transportation and other conditions
of purchase or sale, and shall afford the enterprises of the other
contracting parties adequate opportunity, in accordance with customary
business practice, to compete for participation in such purchases or
sales.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (c) No contracting party shall prevent any enterprise (whether or not
an enterprise described in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph) under its
jurisdiction from acting in accordance with the principles of
subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph.
</p>

<p>
2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to
imports of products for immediate or ultimate consumption in governmental
use and not otherwise for resale or use in the production of goods for
sale. With respect to such imports, each contracting party shall accord
to the trade of the other contracting parties fair and equitable
treatment.
</p>

<p>
3. The contracting parties recognize that enterprises of the kind
described in paragraph 1 (a) of this Article might be operated so as to
create serious obstacles to trade; thus negotiations on a reciprocal and
mutually advantageous basis designed to limit or reduce such obstacles
are of importance to the expansion of international trade.
</p>

<p>
4. </p><p class="indentb"> (a) Contracting parties shall notify the CONTRACTING PARTIES of the
products which arc imported into or exported from their territories by
enterprises of the kind described in paragraph 1 (a) of this Article.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (b) A contracting party establishing, maintaining or authorizing an
import monopoly of a product, which is not the subject of a concession
under Article II, shall, on the request of another contracting party
having a substantial trade in the product concerned, inform the
CONTRACTING PARTIES of the import mark-up on the product during a recent
representative period, or, when it is not possible to do so, of the price
charged on the resale of the product.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (c) The CONTRACTING PARTIES may, at the request of a contracting party
which has reason to believe that its interests under this Agreement are
being adversely affected by the operations of an enterprise of the kind
described in paragraph 1 (a), request the contracting party establishing,
maintaining or authorizing such enterprise to supply information about
its operations related to the carrying out of the provisions of this
Agreement.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
   (d) The provisions of this paragraph shall not require any contracting
party to disclose confidential information which would impede law
enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or would
prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises.
