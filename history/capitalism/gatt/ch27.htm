<p>


Any contracting party shall at any time be free to withhold or to
withdraw in whole or in part any concession, provided for in the
appropriate Schedule annexed to this Agreement, in respect of which such
contracting party determines that it was initially negotiated with a
government which has not become, or has ceased to be, a contracting
party. A contracting party taking such action shall notify the
CONTRACTING PARTIES and, upon request, consult with contracting parties
which have a substantial interest in the product concerned.
