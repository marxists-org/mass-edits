The General Agreement On Tariffs And Trade
</p>

<h3>Article XXXVII
Commitments</h3>

<hr />

<p>


1. The developed contracting parties shall to the fullest extent
possible--that is, except when compelling reasons, which may include
legal reasons, make it impossible--give effect to the following
provisions:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  accord high priority to the reduction and elimination of barriers
      to products currently or potentially of particular export interest
      to less-developed contracting parties, including customs duties and
      other restrictions which differentiate unreasonably between such
      products in their primary and in their processed forms;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  refrain from introducing, or increasing the incidence of, customs
      duties or non-tariff import barriers on products currently or
      potentially of particular export interest to less-developed
      contracting parties; and
</p>

<p class="indentb">
(c) </p><p class="indentc">
    (i)   refrain from imposing new fiscal measures, and
</p>

<p class="indentc">
 (ii)  in any adjustments of fiscal policy accord high priority to
            the reduction and elimination of fiscal measures,
      which would hamper, or which hamper, significantly the growth of
      consumption of primary products, in raw or processed form, wholly
      or mainly produced in the territories of less-developed contracting
      parties, and which are applied specifically to those products.
</p>

<p>
2.</p>
<p class="indentb"> (a) Whenever it is considered that effect is not being given to any of
the provisions of sub-paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 1, the
matter shall be reported to the CONTRACTING PARTIES either by the
contracting party not so giving effect to the relevant provisions or by
any other interested contracting party.
</p>

<p class="indentb">
(b) </p><p class="indentc">
    (i)    The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall, if requested so to do by any
            interested contracting party, and without prejudice to any
            bilateral consultations that may be undertaken, consult with
            the contracting party concerned and all interested
            contracting parties with respect to the matter with a view to
            reaching solutions satisfactory to all contracting parties
            concerned in order to further the objectives set forth in
            Article XXXVI. In the course of these consultations, the
            reasons given in cases where effect was not being given to
            the provisions of subparagraph (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 1
            shall be examined.
</p>

<p class="indentc">
   (ii)     As the implementation of the provisions of sub-paragraph (a),
            (b) or (c) of paragraph 1 by individual contracting parties
            may in some cases be more readily achieved where action is
            taken jointly with other developed contracting parties, such
            consultation might, where appropriate, be directed towards
            this end.
</p>

<p class="indentc">
   (iii)    The consultations by the CONTRACTING PARTIES might also, in
            appropriate cases, be directed towards agreement on joint
            action designed to further the objectives of this Agreement
            as envisaged in paragraph I of Article XXV.
</p>

<p>
3. The developed contracting parties shall:
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (a)  make every effort, in cases where a government directly or
      indirectly determines the resale price of products wholly or mainly
      produced in the territories of less-developed contracting parties,
      to maintain trade margins at equitable levels;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (b)  give active consideration to the adoption of other measures
      designed to provide greater scope for the development of imports
      from less-developed contracting parties and collaborate in
      appropriate international action to this end;
</p>

<p class="indentb">
 (c)  have special regard to the trade interests of less-developed
      contracting parties when considering the application of other
      measures permitted under this Agreement to meet particular problems
      and explore all possibilities of constructive remedies before
      applying such measures where they would affect essential interests
      of those contracting parties.
</p>

<p>
4. Less-developed contracting parties agree to take appropriate action in
implementation of the provisions of Part IV for the benefit of the trade
of other less-developed contracting parties, in so far as such action is
consistent with their individual present and future development,
financial and trade needs taking into account past trade developments as
well as the trade interests of less-developed contracting parties as a
whole.
</p>

<p>
5. In the implementation of the commitments set forth in paragraphs 1 to
4 each contracting party shall afford to any other interested contracting
party or contracting parties full and prompt opportunity for
consultations under the normal procedures of this Agreement with respect
to any matter or difficulty which may arise.
