<h3>Article XVI
Subsidies</h3>

<hr />

<h5>
Section A--Subsidies in General
</h5>

<p>
1. If any contracting party grants or maintains any subsidy, including
any form of income or price support, which operates directly or
indirectly to increase exports of any product from, or to reduce imports
of any product into, its territory, it shall notify the CONTRACTING
PARTIES in writing of the extent and nature of the subsidization, of the
estimated effect of the subsidization on the quantity of the affected
product or products imported into or exported from its territory and of
the circumstances making the subsidization necessary. In any case in
which it is determined that serious prejudice to the interests of any
other contracting party is caused or threatened by any such
subsidization, the contracting party granting the subsidy shall, upon
request, discuss with the other contracting party or parties concerned,
or with the CONTRACTING PARTIES, the possibility of limiting the
subsidization.
</p>

<h5>
        Section B--Additional Provisions on Export Subsidies
</h5>

<p>
2. The contracting parties recognize that the granting by a contracting
party of a subsidy on the export of any product may have harmful effects
for other contracting parties, both importing and exporting, may cause
undue disturbance to their normal commercial interests, and may hinder
the achievement of the objectives of this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
3. Accordingly, contracting parties should seek to avoid the use of
subsidies on the export of primary products. If, however, a contracting
party grants directly or indirectly any form of subsidy which operates to
increase the export of any primary product from its territory, such
subsidy shall not be applied in a manner which results in that
contracting party having more than an equitable share of world export
trade in that product, account being taken of the shares of the
contracting parties in such trade in the product during a previous
representative period, and any special factors which may have affected or
may be affecting such trade in the product.
</p>

<p>
4. Further, as from 1 January 1958 or the earliest practicable date
thereafter, contracting parties shall cease to grant either directly or
indirectly any form of subsidy on the export of any product other than a
primary product which subsidy results in the sale of such product for
export at a price lower than the comparable price charged for the like
product to buyers in the domestic market. Until 31 December 1957 no
contracting party shall extend the scope of any such subsidization beyond
that existing on 1 January 1955 by the introduction of new, or the
extension of existing, subsidies.
</p>

<p>
5. The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall review the operation of the provisions
of this Article from time to time with a view to examining its
effectiveness, in the light of actual experience, in promoting the
objectives of this Agreement and avoiding subsidization seriously
prejudicial to the trade or interests of contracting parties.
