I am from Pakistan. I teach English language and literature at a college near Lahore. I know Urdu, Punjabi and English. It will be a pleasure for me to assist with works in Urdu Language. I have a few books of Marxist literature in Urdu. Though I am teacher of English, but my greatest passion is philosophy, especially that of Hegelian-Marxist school. I am working on a long book on Aesthetics in Urdu. This books is published in serial form in a Marxist Magazine "Angaray" and also in Teachers' newspaper, <em>Ittehad-i-Asatiza</em>.</p>
