<p class="index">Name: <a href="mailto:vanya&#64;marxists.org">An Ha Ho</a></p>

<p class=indentb>(you can call me An Ha or Ha)</p>
<p class=indentb>My birthday is 27th November 1988. I was born and raised in Hanoi, Vietnam. I have been studying Marxism and reading MIA since high school.</p>
<p class=indentb>I joined MIA and started managing <a href="../../../vietnamese/index.htm">Vietnamese Section</a> in 2009.</p>
<p class=indentb>My job is to translate, convert and upload Vietnamese version of Marxist works, such as "Holy Family", "The Origin of the Family...", "The Condition of the Working Class in England", etc.</p>
<p class=indentb>I would like to call myself a Marxist-Leninist, and my main interests are Marx, Engels and Lenin.</p>
